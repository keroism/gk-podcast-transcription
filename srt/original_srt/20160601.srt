1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,827
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, June 1st, 2016.

2
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:11,068
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:14,496
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,560
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,060
Speaker 1: The anime we've been watching.

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:19,598
Speaker 1: It's anime day.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,457
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:29,920
Speaker 1: Problem is, I could have watched a lot more anime, but one, I really got into the new Fargo TV show.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,172
Speaker 1: A little late to the game there.

10
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:31,779
Speaker 1: It was really good.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,980
Speaker 1: And two, I watched a bunch of other anime, but more importantly, three, I've been playing a lot of Overwatch.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,620
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty good.

13
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,019
Speaker 1: Remember when Team Fortress 2 came out?

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,768
Speaker 1: And we were like,

15
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:43,340
Speaker 1: "Yeah!".

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,437
Speaker 1: And then we played it, and that night we were like,

17
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:45,497
Speaker 1: "Eh.".

18
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,317
Speaker 0: It was more like, "Oh, I played it for a few

19
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:48,539
Speaker 0: weeks.".

20
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:52,500
Speaker 1: I played it, but that night I was like, "Oh, this isn't what I wanted.

21
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:53,531
Speaker 1: Okay,

22
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:53,860
Speaker 1: whatever.".

23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,579
Speaker 1: And I played it for a few weeks and I just stopped.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,720
Speaker 1: Overwatch is only superficially similar to it.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:19,019
Speaker 1: I'm not going to review it now because it's Wednesday day, but it is way closer to Quake II Weapons Factory or Team Fortress than Team Fortress 2 ever got, which is interesting that this is the game that made it, but it's also got a... It's like every MOBA has the same set of characters and the same aesthetic now.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,040
Speaker 1: I think pretty much every eSport game that isn't video ball or Rocket League is going to look like this down the road.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,699
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

28
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:31,299
Speaker 1: People still confuse this game with, what, Battleborn or that other game that doesn't look good?

29
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:33,179
Speaker 1: That's actually a MOBA, I guess?

30
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:33,856
Speaker 0: I don't know.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,957
Speaker 1: Anyway, people seem to be confusing the two, like non-gamers, because they have very similar style, even though they're completely different games.

32
00:01:41,424 --> 00:01:42,459
Speaker 1: See, I've been playing a lot of that.

33
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:49,458
Speaker 1: I guess if I had any more opening bits or anecdotes... Actually...

34
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,360
Speaker 0: It's warm today.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,800
Speaker 1: Something funny happened.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,259
Speaker 1: A biking story today involving a Fixie.

37
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:54,607
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

38
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:55,759
Speaker 1: But it's a new one.

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,200
Speaker 1: This is something that's never happened to me before.

40
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:03,219
Speaker 1: So I'm biking and I pass this really slow guy on a Fixie and he's with his friend who's on a Fixie and also really slow.

41
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,380
Speaker 0: Are you sure it was Fixies in that one speed?

42
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:10,098
Speaker 1: One of them, at least, was an actual Fixie, because I saw him coasting, sticking his legs up.

43
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:11,660
Speaker 1: The pedals were still going.

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,214
Speaker 0: Yep, okay.

45
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,520
Speaker 1: I didn't confirm the other guy.

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,938
Speaker 1: They had brakes, so I'll give them that.

47
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,079
Speaker 0: Was this the one front brake?

48
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:18,840
Speaker 1: Maybe.

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't inspect their bikes that closely.

50
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,279
Speaker 1: I'm not that obsessed.

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,599
Speaker 1: But so I'm biking and I stop at the red light and they shoal and get in the way of traffic and run the red light and kind of puff past me.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,779
Speaker 1: And then I pass him every time the light turns green.

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,340
Speaker 1: And eventually, I get to a red light and there's a bunch of traffic.

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,520
Speaker 1: So even when they catch up to me, they can't just go through the light.

55
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:41,579
Speaker 1: They just stand there.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:52,199
Speaker 1: And the one guy pulls up next to me and is just staring at my bike, like really staring at it, not even trying to hide the fact, like looking at it so intently.

57
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:56,559
Speaker 1: And he keeps doing it for like 20 seconds or so.

58
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,959
Speaker 1: So finally I just turn to him.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,611
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Can I help you?

60
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:00,075
Speaker 1: What's

61
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:00,256
Speaker 1: up?".

62
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,230
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Where's the

63
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,693
Speaker 1: battery?".

64
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,712
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "What do you

65
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:05,097
Speaker 1: mean?".

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,695
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Well, how are you going so

67
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:07,040
Speaker 1: fast?".

68
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:11,739
Speaker 1: And I got to use the line that I've always wanted to be able to use on one of these kinds of people.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,620
Speaker 1: But I'm just biking.

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,680
Speaker 1: I'm not going to stop and yell a retort.

71
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,680
Speaker 1: I just keep going.

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Speaker 1: So I turn to him and I'm like, "I have gears.

73
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,299
Speaker 1: That's how I go fast.

74
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:23,953
Speaker 1: If you had gears, you could go

75
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:24,397
Speaker 1: fast.".

76
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:25,695
Speaker 1: And he's like, "There's no

77
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:25,960
Speaker 1: way.".

78
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:26,920
Speaker 1: And then the light turned green.

79
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,696
Speaker 1: I never saw him again.

80
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:34,899
Speaker 1: But the fact that he's just standing there, like staring at my bike.

81
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,140
Speaker 1: It's one of those like, you know when a stranger does something a little bit weird.

82
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,838
Speaker 1: and in New York your sense goes off of like, "Wait a minute.

83
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,160
Speaker 1: That one's not acting like the rest of the herd.

84
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,548
Speaker 1: Warning,

85
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:45,958
Speaker 1: warning.".

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,899
Speaker 0: I mean, even if you only had one, it's like bikes are leg-powered.

87
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,960
Speaker 0: It's like he couldn't imagine there would be someone with better legs than him.

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,638
Speaker 0: It's like, "Let me introduce you to professional

89
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:57,920
Speaker 0: cyclists.".

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,620
Speaker 1: So, well, but the thing is even a professional cyclist.

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,600
Speaker 0: That's like I'm playing basketball against Michael Jordan.

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,000
Speaker 0: I'm like, "How did you score so many points?

93
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,820
Speaker 0: Where's your performance-enhancing drugs?

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,278
Speaker 0: Where are your drugs?

95
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,077
Speaker 0: How did you do it?

96
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,280
Speaker 0: There's no other way.

97
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,890
Speaker 0: You could have done

98
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:14,992
Speaker 0: it.".

99
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,519
Speaker 1: But I think it's partly, it's not the high speed.

100
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,380
Speaker 1: It's the acceleration.

101
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,641
Speaker 1: Because

102
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,065
Speaker 0: remember,

103
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:36,080
Speaker 1: even a professional cyclist, if you're sitting at a dead stop on an uphill slope, that's a not insignificant slope, and someone who is way less athletic than you is starting at the exact same spot, but they have a real bike with gears, they will accelerate way faster than you.

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Speaker 1: You're going to pass them eventually because you have legs the size of my torso, but they're going to accelerate faster than you.

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
Speaker 1: There is no way around that unless you snap your chain.

106
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,299
Speaker 1: It was just an interesting moment because he was so fixated on it.

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,258
Speaker 1: Fixated, fixie.

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,396
Speaker 1: All right, there we go.

109
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:56,480
Speaker 1: That wasn't intentional.

110
00:04:58,842 --> 00:04:59,900
Speaker 1: That's what happened to me today.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Speaker 1: Got any news related to anime or comics or manga?

112
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:03,559
Speaker 0: I do have news.

113
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:14,040
Speaker 0: People always be complaining about PAX and the way it sells tickets, and Robert Koop did that interview where he pretty much gave the lowdown, which is the exact same lowdown we always gave.

114
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,692
Speaker 1: It's like, "Kids, if you've been around the block, I know you're going to

115
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:18,259
Speaker 1: conventions.".

116
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,039
Speaker 0: This is how I do.

117
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:25,460
Speaker 1: It's like never tried to buy tickets to a hockey game, never tried to get tickets to a popular concert.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,060
Speaker 1: That shit is way harder than even these conventions you guys are so upset about.

119
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:34,619
Speaker 0: Anyway, New York Comic Con, many conventions have tried different solutions, lotteries and things.

120
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,800
Speaker 0: They all had their problems.

121
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,599
Speaker 0: New York Comic Con is trying something new this year, and interestingly enough, it has some positive and some negative aspects.

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,254
Speaker 0: It's actually not the worst idea.

123
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,240
Speaker 0: It's not just awful, but I think overall it's still negative.

124
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,360
Speaker 1: I will admit, I bristled at it just instinctively before I actually tried to figure it out.

125
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,614
Speaker 0: I think it's still worth the bristle, but it's not 100% bad.

126
00:05:58,905 --> 00:05:59,169
Speaker 0: It's 50% bad.

127
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,539
Speaker 1: I bristle at almost anything.

128
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, here's what they're doing.

129
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,720
Speaker 0: They're doing fan verification.

130
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,659
Speaker 0: Here's how this works.

131
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,300
Speaker 0: First, you got to go to their website and make a profile.

132
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,239
Speaker 0: Why do you do this?

133
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Speaker 0: So that they can collect all your personal information.

134
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,275
Speaker 1: Hooray!

135
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:19,299
Speaker 0: Also, I just learned that, like, um, that Reed -- Did you know who owns Reed?

136
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,058
Speaker 1: Uh, I actually don't.

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,980
Speaker 0: Reed is owned by an evil, evil company.

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,738
Speaker 1: Which one?

139
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:25,840
Speaker 0: Elsevier.

140
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:27,262
Speaker 1: Oh!

141
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:27,323
Speaker 1: Oh!

142
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,879
Speaker 1: I know all about them.

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, the people who refuse to open up their medical and scientific journals for freeness, right?

144
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,760
Speaker 1: I've had recruiters from them.

145
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,199
Speaker 0: I figured out it was from them.

146
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,240
Speaker 0: The people who you could say murdered Aaron Schwartz indirectly.

147
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,860
Speaker 1: I know all about that company.

148
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:50,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they like to collect -- You know, they own LexisNexis and whatnot.

149
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,880
Speaker 0: They want to collect your information and put it in a database.

150
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,039
Speaker 0: So that's the worst part of this.

151
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Speaker 0: So anyone who wants a New York Comic Con ticket has to make a profile on their website so they can collect your personal information for their business purposes, right?

152
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,480
Speaker 0: So then what they do is they're going to let you know if you have a profile that's been verified, they're going to let you know when tickets are going to go on sale.

153
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:11,719
Speaker 0: Which is cool.

154
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:15,880
Speaker 0: Alright, because now no scalpers are going to have profiles, right?

155
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,719
Speaker 0: So it's no big deal.

156
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,060
Speaker 0: Then all the ticket types will go on sale at the same time.

157
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:21,680
Speaker 0: Also good.

158
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,380
Speaker 0: They're not going to sell VIP tickets anymore.

159
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,138
Speaker 0: Also good.

160
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,900
Speaker 0: That's great.

161
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:29,640
Speaker 1: VIP tickets were one of the main problems I had with the New York Comic Con.

162
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,099
Speaker 0: They're only going to sell tickets on their website and not in comic book stores like they used to.

163
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,195
Speaker 0: Which, good and bad-ish, maybe.

164
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:36,740
Speaker 0: Whatever.

165
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,160
Speaker 0: It was kind of nice to be able to go to a comic store and get a ticket.

166
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:41,680
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, except that didn't work anymore.

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,577
Speaker 1: Because all that meant was you either stand in line outside of a comic book store that has like 10 tickets.

168
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:55,980
Speaker 0: The thing is the comic book stores had a lot more than 10 tickets, like Midtown, and there were so many of them in the city that got tickets that you could actually pretty easily get them there.

169
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 0: People didn't know about this a lot.

170
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:58,799
Speaker 1: Well, that was it.

171
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,362
Speaker 1: If you

172
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:12,319
Speaker 0: needed a ticket late, I remember in past years comic book stores in the city were the only places that still had them and people just didn't know to go there and get them, which is, I guess, also why it's fine to just take that away from them.

173
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,560
Speaker 0: Anyway, so then they're going to be sold first come, first serve basis.

174
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,299
Speaker 1: So normal.

175
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:19,792
Speaker 0: Normal.

176
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:30,840
Speaker 0: And basically what happens is, is on the day they go on sale, you can log in and buy one ticket per person and for a certain number of friends.

177
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,198
Speaker 0: So let's say me, Rim, and Emily all want to go.

178
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,919
Speaker 1: We each have to make a profile.

179
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,299
Speaker 0: We each have to make a profile.

180
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:36,794
Speaker 0: Right.

181
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,020
Speaker 0: And then one of us can buy three tickets.

182
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:48,039
Speaker 0: And if it's a I guess I could buy three Fridays, three Saturdays and three Sundays because we have three profiles, even though I'm one person and I'm paying for all of them.

183
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:52,640
Speaker 0: We need to have a profile for each individual human being going to the con.

184
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,759
Speaker 0: And then I could buy the three tickets for the three profiles like that.

185
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:00,740
Speaker 0: So this should prevent scalping because a scalper wants to buy a lot of tickets.

186
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,719
Speaker 0: I had to make a lot of profiles and they're not going to let you make that many.

187
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,000
Speaker 0: But also they're just collecting information that everyone was going.

188
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,920
Speaker 0: But also, I think the biggest problem with this, besides the collecting your information so blatantly, is they're selling a lot of tickets to this thing.

189
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,420
Speaker 0: It's huge.

190
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:22,437
Speaker 0: But only Internet people will know to do this.

191
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:23,880
Speaker 0: Right.

192
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,619
Speaker 1: That's what I was about to get to.

193
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:29,340
Speaker 0: A lot of people go to New York Comic Con are not fans.

194
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,040
Speaker 1: Guys, there are people who want to go to PAX who show up at PAX and don't understand that they can't buy a ticket to it.

195
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,720
Speaker 0: Because I think they're going to have a problem selling out because people won't know to make profiles to buy a ticket.

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,100
Speaker 1: I think enough people know to where it'll still sell out and a bunch of other people who wouldn't have gotten them anyway.

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:58,879
Speaker 1: The same people who normally don't get them because they don't try to log on and buy them immediately are now going to think that they didn't get them because they didn't fill out this problem or whatever.

198
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,413
Speaker 1: The same people won't get badges.

199
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:02,800
Speaker 1: They'll be mad for a different reason.

200
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,263
Speaker 0: I don't know.

201
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:11,160
Speaker 0: I think that you're going to see also a harder core audience of people who know how to Internet and know how to check on these things so far in advance.

202
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:21,680
Speaker 1: Which actually could be bad for New York Comic Con's business because New York Comic Con seems to thrive on getting kind of casual fans who are just going for one day to walk around and buy stuff.

203
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,735
Speaker 1: That seems to be...

204
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,720
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

205
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,280
Speaker 1: That's the kind of people they want there.

206
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:32,000
Speaker 0: You're going to get less of the people that they actually want but they're going to get more information about the people who are there and maybe cater to them more.

207
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,645
Speaker 0: I don't know.

208
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:43,520
Speaker 0: This is still... I guess props for trying something and creative idea but I think that you should still just do it the PAX way.

209
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,599
Speaker 0: I can't see this being any more successful than that.

210
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:49,753
Speaker 0: Other than the money they make from collecting all the information maybe helps them more.

211
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:50,117
Speaker 0: I don't know.

212
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:57,439
Speaker 1: The only people who do not need profiles... For kids under 5, just get in for any one.

213
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,900
Speaker 1: Kids aged between 6 and 12, there's two kinds of badges they can get.

214
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:05,300
Speaker 1: They have to get an adult badge unless they go on Sunday.

215
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,120
Speaker 1: then they get a slightly cheaper kids badge.

216
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,619
Speaker 1: Kids aged 6 to 12 do not need a profile because Child Online Protection Act you're not allowed to collect that information about those kids.

217
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:16,559
Speaker 1: I'm reading this now.

218
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:32,100
Speaker 1: If you want to buy a badge for a kid aged 6 to 12 you'll still have to get the adult badge for Saturday and you just have to note that you're purchasing one or more of your tickets for a kid aged 6 to 12 and then you would sign them the ticket without them having a profile.

219
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,339
Speaker 1: but supposedly it is just an adult ticket.

220
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:40,700
Speaker 1: but "any New York Comic Con tickets assigned to kids will only be valid for kids aged 6 to 12 at the time of New York Comic Con.

221
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,696
Speaker 1: this will be noted on their badge RFID".

222
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,400
Speaker 1: and remember New York Comic Con is the only reason this all works.

223
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,560
Speaker 1: because they're doing that bullshit.

224
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,160
Speaker 1: You have to scan your badge to enter and exit the convention.

225
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:55,120
Speaker 0: And they're going to have your personal information associated with your badge.

226
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, and vendors.

227
00:11:56,226 --> 00:12:00,513
Speaker 1: It's going to be like those bullshit vendor conferences where every vendor is like "Hey, you want the free thing?

228
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,957
Speaker 1: Tap your badge and then we're going to spam you for the rest of your

229
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:03,200
Speaker 1: life.".

230
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:10,820
Speaker 0: I'm telling you, overall it's a negative but there is some interesting ideas here, right?

231
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,660
Speaker 0: I think you could take part of these ideas.

232
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:16,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, no tap-in, no badge-in, ever at a PAX.

233
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Speaker 0: You could do the PAX profiles but they could just be cool gamer profiles not collecting your info, right?

234
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,540
Speaker 1: Actually, that would be a good idea.

235
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:33,859
Speaker 1: Make your PAX profile and then actually, Penny Arcade is one of the few groups that would have the clout to go to game companies like Blizzard and say "Hey, integrate this with your system and Steam and

236
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,080
Speaker 1: everything.".

237
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could do some okay stuff with that.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,340
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's how Robert could take that and make it a pretty legit thing.

239
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,200
Speaker 0: Do it nicely and also help integrate it with badge-getting to make it a little bit better, something like that, I don't know.

240
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:50,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but again, scalpers are not the problem.

241
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,180
Speaker 1: Demand is the problem.

242
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:52,620
Speaker 0: Correct.

243
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,820
Speaker 1: And demand cannot be addressed.

244
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:57,140
Speaker 1: Now, it's interesting because demand was addressed for us.

245
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,539
Speaker 1: Remember, we stopped going to the New York Comic-Con many years ago.

246
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:00,920
Speaker 0: I had free badges.

247
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,999
Speaker 0: It's right fucking there.

248
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,820
Speaker 1: Like, I used to get the professional badge every year and half the time I'd get the badge and literally not go because there's nothing to do or see there.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,720
Speaker 0: It's a giant conflict store, what do you need to go there for?

250
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,080
Speaker 1: I mean, now the panels are all just like paid pro panels or whatever.

251
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:29,739
Speaker 1: but I remember a time when I went to the actual New York Comic-Con and I went to where the panels were and I walked around with my camera videoing all these panel rooms with scheduled panels and panelists but literally no one was in these panels watching them.

252
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,060
Speaker 1: It was people sitting in the front of the room, empty room, doing nothing.

253
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,820
Speaker 1: It was just terrifying to behold.

254
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:47,759
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess if you want to go to New York Comic-Con, make sure you pay attention to this because, I mean, even small dumpy cons, it's like no one knows how to internet.

255
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,979
Speaker 1: Like, there were people at PAX, right?

256
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
Speaker 1: PAX East, the one that just happened, who knew that Markiplier was a guest somehow.

257
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:08,020
Speaker 1: They knew that he was in a particular theater doing something, that he was in the Albatross Theater at some point during the convention and they showed up at the convention with a PAX badge which, remember, is very hard to get at PAX East.

258
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:20,700
Speaker 1: so somehow, their whole family, they got PAX badges, they show up at PAX, there's a guest they want to see, they know he's at the con, they know what room his panel was in, they didn't know his panel was on Friday and he didn't have any panels on Saturday.

259
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:27,880
Speaker 1: So those are the kinds of people who now have to navigate this system for the New York Comic-Con.

260
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:32,339
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of people who will fly to New York and then not have a badge.

261
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:37,380
Speaker 1: And then buy one from all the friendly scalpers who I guarantee are still going to be out on the street.

262
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:50,220
Speaker 1: So in other news, the internet was going crazy about this and I kind of don't want to talk about it so much as a sort of, there's an underlying problem way deeper than the thing that I'm about to talk about.

263
00:14:50,620 --> 00:15:05,719
Speaker 1: So I'm sure you saw that Captain America is apparently a Nazi which, honestly, in terms of comic books, had you told me that, like years ago, 20 years ago, I would have just assumed, alright, sure, they'll undo it at some point.

264
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,207
Speaker 1: He's probably dead at the end of that series or whatever because it's comic books.

265
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,580
Speaker 1: You can't spoil comic books.

266
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:19,199
Speaker 0: Also, I think it's kind of weird that everyone says he's a Nazi but I think the truth is that he's in Hydra which is a terrorist organization which isn't Nazis.

267
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:32,040
Speaker 1: It is canonical through several avenues of Captain America comics that Hydra was actually the Nazis or that the Nazis were propped up by Hydra as part of a scheme.

268
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,980
Speaker 0: I thought the Hydra was anti-Nazi but this shows you how comic books are so fucked up.

269
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,279
Speaker 0: there's no one right answer to anything.

270
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:44,020
Speaker 0: The same way that Russians, you know, commies are anti-Nazi.

271
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:54,240
Speaker 1: It's hard for me to be offended by this just because of the fact that Captain America is an ancient character that they're still making comics about for some reason and, I mean, how many times did they kill Superman or Batman or whatever?

272
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, I usually judge...

273
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,640
Speaker 1: Like, clearly he's brainwashed or it's alternate reality or whatever nonsense is going to happen because that's how this goes.

274
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:11,737
Speaker 0: I usually judge underwear pervert heroes, their quality, based on how many of the books focusing on them are worth reading and they're very... right?

275
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,700
Speaker 0: It's like how many Captain America comic books are like top tier comic books?

276
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,080
Speaker 1: I can only name a handful of top tier underwear pervert comics and most of them are one-offs.

277
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:21,881
Speaker 0: Right.

278
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,700
Speaker 0: Captain America, it's like there aren't a lot of great Captain America books.

279
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:26,174
Speaker 0: It's like...

280
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,320
Speaker 1: He punched Hitler that one time.

281
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,299
Speaker 0: There's some Avengers stories, right, that are like, you know, pretty great that are like up there.

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Cap's just part of it.

283
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
Speaker 0: He's just... it's not like they focus on him a whole lot.

284
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,100
Speaker 0: He's just sort of like... he's just there and he's usually just, you know, hitting things with his mighty shield and whatnot.

285
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:49,575
Speaker 0: He's not really, you know... I mean, like, his story overall, like, oh, he was frozen in the ice and, you know, it's like, that's an okay story.

286
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:50,200
Speaker 0: It's okay.

287
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:54,378
Speaker 0: But, like, the actual comic books containing that story, you don't need to read those.

288
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,480
Speaker 0: They're not particularly amazing comic books of any kind.

289
00:16:59,063 --> 00:16:59,246
Speaker 0: Right?

290
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:00,019
Speaker 0: You can skip it.

291
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:08,650
Speaker 1: So, the good thing that came out of this is the memes of, like, someone just drew a really great Steven Universe stand in there and he's like, "Hell

292
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,537
Speaker 1: homeworld.".

293
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:11,520
Speaker 1: The memes around this are great.

294
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:43,480
Speaker 1: But the underlying issue is just that a lot of people were really mad about this and for the reason being, they're invested in this character and they're mad and deeply, like, they feel deeply about something that happened to a fictional character to the point that they will send death threats or that they somehow feel like because they're a big fan of a property, of someone else's property, that they somehow are entitled to have, like, input into how that property is treated.

295
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,960
Speaker 0: This has been true for as long as comic books have been printed.

296
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,460
Speaker 0: This is what's news here.

297
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:50,629
Speaker 1: That's not news.

298
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,019
Speaker 1: That's the underlying issue.

299
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:02,699
Speaker 1: And what's interesting is that finally, this time, multiple essays have been written and the sort of pop nerd culture is actually talking about that issue as a result of this.

300
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,339
Speaker 0: That's not new either.

301
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:05,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

302
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,060
Speaker 1: People haven't really talked about it that much.

303
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,300
Speaker 0: Talking about it for a long time.

304
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:12,440
Speaker 1: Outside of some circles that we're in, that is not a common nerd theme.

305
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:19,858
Speaker 1: Mostly the nerd theme is, "I am entitled to this character or this actor that I like who shouldn't be dating someone in the real

306
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:20,160
Speaker 1: world.".

307
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,797
Speaker 0: I mean, I was reading, like, you know, quote, "think pieces," you know, long ago.

308
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,577
Speaker 0: Hot takes?

309
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, hot takes in, like, the '90s that were like, "Hey, people aren't going to have wars about religion anymore.

310
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,457
Speaker 0: They're going to be having wars about, like, you know, bands, like which band people are following and shit like

311
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:36,678
Speaker 0: that.".

312
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,820
Speaker 0: And I think somebody referenced one of those things in one of these newer ones.

313
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,511
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh, I remember reading

314
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:42,693
Speaker 0: that.".

315
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:53,657
Speaker 1: But I guess it's real hard for me to feel anything about this character because Captain America is so old and comic books are notorious for doing and undoing things so often that you could tell

316
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:53,979
Speaker 0: me that,

317
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,655
Speaker 1: "Oh, yeah, it turns out that literally every one of the Avengers is literally a

318
00:18:57,716 --> 00:18:57,899
Speaker 1: Nazi.".

319
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,639
Speaker 1: And I would say, "Well, that had to happen at some

320
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:00,820
Speaker 1: point.".

321
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:01,796
Speaker 0: Right.

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:13,380
Speaker 0: I think the, you know, the only part of it that I can sort of sympathize with the upset people, right, is that, like, let's say you're the kind of person who is, like, got the collecting part, right, in your brain.

323
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:15,400
Speaker 0: You've got to buy them all, like Pokémon, right?

324
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,239
Speaker 0: And every month, no matter what, you buy Captain America on, like, clockwork, right?

325
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,690
Speaker 0: And that's your thing.

326
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,078
Speaker 0: It's like you read it.

327
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,920
Speaker 0: You know, you buy Spider-Man every month.

328
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,620
Speaker 0: You just keep getting Spider-Man no matter what.

329
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,279
Speaker 1: That's the monomaniacal fan whose identity is tied up in the thing they collect.

330
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320
Speaker 0: And every month you read this thing and you really like reading it, right?

331
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:45,060
Speaker 0: But unlike, say, something like One Piece where you read it every month and it's always One Piece with the same creators, you know, and the same story going on, this Spider-Man, like, changes.

332
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,039
Speaker 0: You've got a new writer.

333
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,640
Speaker 0: You've got a new, you know, new story.

334
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,940
Speaker 0: You've got a new character in there.

335
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,479
Speaker 0: And, like, you've been buying it all this time because you liked it.

336
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,439
Speaker 0: And now it changes.

337
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:55,640
Speaker 0: And now you don't like it anymore.

338
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,820
Speaker 0: And you're like, no, this thing that I was enjoying every month, like a routine, like when they changed the flavor of my fucking orange juice, right?

339
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,740
Speaker 1: Or, like, you're into My Little Pony because of the comic.

340
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:06,540
Speaker 1: And then Frank Miller takes over.

341
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:07,680
Speaker 0: Right.

342
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,178
Speaker 0: I mean, like, I remember, you know, I bought Spider-Man 2099 when I was a kid every month, right?

343
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:12,919
Speaker 0: That was my book.

344
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,180
Speaker 0: It's still a great book, by the way.

345
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,160
Speaker 0: If you can get the old Spider-Man 2099, it's, like, super cyberpunk and amazing.

346
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:22,800
Speaker 0: But there was one issue where, like, suddenly it was following this plot.

347
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,339
Speaker 0: And then suddenly this one random issue, which I now realize today was, like, a filler issue because the real artists and writers couldn't get it in on time, right?

348
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:34,820
Speaker 0: Had, like, really bad art and a really weird story and had nothing to do.

349
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,500
Speaker 0: It was like a side story that had nothing to do with the plot.

350
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,700
Speaker 0: It was just, like, just random nothing.

351
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:40,878
Speaker 0: And I was like, what the fuck is this?

352
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:43,700
Speaker 0: And I wrote in a letter because they always had those letters columns.

353
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,579
Speaker 0: And there was some other letter in the back of the next issue that got back to the main story, the main artist, and the main writer again.

354
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,980
Speaker 0: It looked a lot like my letter, only all the negatives are changed to positives.

355
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:58,818
Speaker 0: I don't know what was up with that.

356
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,671
Speaker 0: But, yeah.

357
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,120
Speaker 1: See, at least when you were in the Strong Bad emails, it was pretty much your email.

358
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,536
Speaker 0: Mostly, yeah.

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,520
Speaker 0: At least I'm -- but it didn't -- I didn't know if it was mine because, you know.

360
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:09,030
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:09,380
Speaker 0: Anyway.

362
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,698
Speaker 0: But, yeah.

363
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,520
Speaker 0: You know, that's the only thing I can sympathize with.

364
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,160
Speaker 0: Like, if you're into this thing, it's, like, your routine and someone changes it on you.

365
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:30,840
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you can't ever be so monomaniacal about fictional media that a change to that media is actually physically devastating or mentally devastating to your well-being as a person.

366
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,198
Speaker 0: Dude, you want to have some fun?

367
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:38,120
Speaker 0: Go to all the websites of, like, all the metal magazines, right?

368
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,000
Speaker 0: And, basically, all the metal magazines have been writing, like, constant articles about, like, baby metal every day.

369
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,424
Speaker 0: Oh, dude.

370
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,139
Speaker 1: I saw a bunch of that.

371
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:49,273
Speaker 1: I remember Motorhead was like, "What the fuck have you done?

372
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,898
Speaker 1: These girls are out there making

373
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:51,179
Speaker 1: metal.".

374
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:51,681
Speaker 0: Right.

375
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:53,089
Speaker 0: All of the comments sections on those articles.

376
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,060
Speaker 0: Because, basically, tons of people are reading these articles because they're all fans.

377
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,260
Speaker 0: They're bringing the magazines and stuff, tons of money.

378
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:00,597
Speaker 0: Yup.

379
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,019
Speaker 0: And tons of eyeballs.

380
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,219
Speaker 0: But all the comments sections are, like, the most, like, prototypical Internet flame wars.

381
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:10,516
Speaker 1: Look, it came full circle.

382
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 0: Of pet ants and all of it's the greatest.

383
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:18,380
Speaker 1: It came full circle with, you know, the Ghostbusters and the MRAs because, you know, there's the all-female Ghostbusters.

384
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:19,557
Speaker 0: Same thing.

385
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,734
Speaker 1: Dan Aykroyd tweeted the other day and he was like, "This movie is great.

386
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,159
Speaker 1: Like, this might be better than the

387
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:25,420
Speaker 1: originals.".

388
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,191
Speaker 0: Even the drunk guy.

389
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:28,340
Speaker 0: Drunk old guy likes it.

390
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,160
Speaker 1: But when the original cast is like, "This movie might be funnier than what we made before,".

391
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:42,333
Speaker 1: and the first response to that message was some MRI guy being like, "I guess you're shitting all over the originals with the fuck, man.

392
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:42,956
Speaker 0: Ruining my...".

393
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,143
Speaker 0: He's like, "Really, dude?

394
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:52,317
Speaker 1: That's literally, like, that is literally the worst possible way to make your point to attack Dan Aykroyd about

395
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,279
Speaker 1: Ghostbusters.".

396
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,180
Speaker 1: I guess attacking Bill Murray about it is, like, the only way you could go worse.

397
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,030
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

398
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,397
Speaker 1: So, Scott, I'm curious.

399
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,430
Speaker 1: Do you know how George Washington died?

400
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,570
Speaker 0: I thought I did, but I guess I was wrong.

401
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, because the other night I was talking to Emily and I was like, "You know how George Washington died,

402
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:16,030
Speaker 1: right?".

403
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,166
Speaker 1: And she's like, "Yeah, he got sick and, like, the doctors drained his blood and that killed

404
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:20,306
Speaker 1: him.".

405
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:21,676
Speaker 1: What?

406
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,429
Speaker 0: I never heard that.

407
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,920
Speaker 1: That's apparently pretty common knowledge.

408
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:26,990
Speaker 1: You just thought he died of old age.

409
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:28,024
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,625
Speaker 1: No, he died of old...

411
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,029
Speaker 0: Bad doctoring?

412
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:38,810
Speaker 1: So, the story that most people seem to know, other than you, is that, you know, bloodletting was terrible practice because doctors sucked and he got sick.

413
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,670
Speaker 0: I thought the bloodletting ended way before the times of George Washington.

414
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,499
Speaker 1: So, you should watch this video.

415
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,710
Speaker 1: It's a SciShow video, but Hank Green says it best.

416
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:53,950
Speaker 1: If you're ever going to time travel, don't go to any time period before about 1940 because there wasn't medicine before then.

417
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:04,670
Speaker 0: Well, I know that medicine was shitty until, you know, early... I thought even 19... I mean, medicine... I know that medicine in 1940 was way better, but I figured we stopped bloodletting way before.

418
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:14,970
Speaker 1: So, the high-level story that most people know is, you know, doctors drained his blood because, you know, doctors sucked back then and then that caused him to die and they kind of leave it at that.

419
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:24,830
Speaker 1: The specifics of what happened, basically, between four and six doctors fucking murdered him when he basically had, at worst, the flu.

420
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,290
Speaker 0: Well, the flu would fucking kill you in 1797.

421
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,910
Speaker 1: He probably would have survived what was going on.

422
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:30,350
Speaker 0: He was a tough motherfucker.

423
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,830
Speaker 1: The worst disease he could have had...

424
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:35,870
Speaker 0: Even the non-fictional George Washington was a tough motherfucker, right?

425
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:42,730
Speaker 1: He might have had this particular fast onset swelling of something in your throat, but he more likely had a severe cold or a flu.

426
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,754
Speaker 1: Probably would have been okay.

427
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:50,550
Speaker 1: He got it because he was such a tough motherfucker that he was working out in the snow all day and then he was soaking wet.

428
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,430
Speaker 1: He came inside and he didn't want to delay dinner, so he refused to change into dry clothes.

429
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,490
Speaker 1: And then the next day, he had a sore throat and instead of staying in bed, he went outside and did the same thing again.

430
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:00,987
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, George Washington.

432
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,236
Speaker 0: I mean, there's funny jokes like, "Aw,

433
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,337
Speaker 0: man.".

434
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:20,810
Speaker 1: George Washington was probably the first known person for whom "I'm too old for this shit and I'm unwilling to deal with your shit" are probably like... He made those come into being in American culture.

435
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,650
Speaker 0: Like the real George Washington, right?

436
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,450
Speaker 0: He was like six feet tall plus and buff.

437
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:26,649
Speaker 0: He could fuck you up.

438
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,240
Speaker 0: He was not a tiny person, right?

439
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:32,745
Speaker 0: I'm talking about the real George Washington.

440
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,884
Speaker 1: Not the 40-foot radiation one.

441
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,992
Speaker 0: Right, not that one.

442
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:37,475
Speaker 0: That's just an exaggeration, right?

443
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,520
Speaker 0: The real one was a guy.

444
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,823
Speaker 1: you were not going to fight with him, right?

445
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,840
Speaker 0: It's like you could take on a lot of the other guys like Jefferson.

446
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,743
Speaker 0: He's just like an old man.

447
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,610
Speaker 0: You could knock him the fuck out, right?

448
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,010
Speaker 0: But you weren't going to mess with Washington, right?

449
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,962
Speaker 1: So here's what really happened to George Washington.

450
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,390
Speaker 1: He had this cold, basically.

451
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:59,689
Speaker 1: Doctors, of course, they did bloodletting right away.

452
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:06,490
Speaker 1: They fed him poison, which they made him vomit a whole bunch, which dehydrated him.

453
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:18,790
Speaker 1: They burned his mouth and throat with acid because apparently that was an expected and common treatment for a sore throat is to fucking put acid in your throat and burn you severely.

454
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,070
Speaker 1: And they were doing all this to try to balance his humors.

455
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:23,734
Speaker 1: They drew his blood.

456
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:29,750
Speaker 1: They drew such an amount of his blood that it is shocking he didn't die then and there.

457
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,870
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, first of all, so badass, he's not going to die even if you take half his blood.

458
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:37,930
Speaker 0: And two, his heart is probably pumping so much blood, they started letting it, and he's like spraying it all over the fuck.

459
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,950
Speaker 1: So they drained his blood, and then they decide that he's not getting better fast enough because they got his humors too far in one direction.

460
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,990
Speaker 1: So they burned his fucking throat with acid, and then they decide that's not enough, so they make him vomit with poison.

461
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,513
Speaker 1: Then they burn his throat again.

462
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:52,558
Speaker 1: They draw his blood again.

463
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:56,768
Speaker 1: I think by the third time they drew his blood, and at this point they've taken like 20% of all his blood.

464
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,110
Speaker 1: He started to get better for a period of maybe a few hours, and then he died.

465
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,353
Speaker 1: So it's not just that.

466
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,498
Speaker 1: doctors did bloodletting and then he died.

467
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:13,150
Speaker 1: It was a bunch of doctors poisoned him and drew and bled him to death because he had a cold.

468
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,695
Speaker 0: Well, you know what this proves?

469
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,004
Speaker 0: This proves who would win in a fight.

470
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,570
Speaker 0: George Washington.

471
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:19,429
Speaker 1: And anyone?

472
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,733
Speaker 0: And Rasputin.

473
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:25,750
Speaker 0: Rasputin would win because Rasputin got fucked up way more before he died.

474
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,990
Speaker 0: And he laid there bleeding, but still alive.

475
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,739
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, Rasputin took way more than that.

476
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,687
Speaker 0: If they did that shit to Rasputin, he'd be like,

477
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:33,088
Speaker 0: "Aight.".

478
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,670
Speaker 1: Yup, and now even though the end of Rasputin- Rasputin was also a giant butt fucker.

479
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:42,870
Speaker 1: The end of Rasputin, like the final end, was exaggerated almost definitely.

480
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:48,250
Speaker 1: But dude survived with probably a sucking lung wound and a chest wound.

481
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,009
Speaker 1: Didn't he get shot with a gun?

482
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,370
Speaker 1: The vague story I remember is they poisoned him, and he just wouldn't die from the poison.

483
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,070
Speaker 1: So eventually the dude shot him a couple times, and then they just left the room.

484
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,769
Speaker 0: Didn't they eventually have to dump him in the river to kill him?

485
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:05,490
Speaker 1: Well, he was probably actually dead by the time they dumped him in the river.

486
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:06,069
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

487
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:06,754
Speaker 1: Probably.

488
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:09,029
Speaker 1: But the story is that he was still alive even then.

489
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,310
Speaker 0: Well, we learned that he can take Washington.

490
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:11,794
Speaker 0: Yup.

491
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,300
Speaker 0: At least at that age, right?

492
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:14,390
Speaker 0: The age at which they died.

493
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:15,465
Speaker 0: Each one, right?

494
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:15,670
Speaker 0: Whatever.

495
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,810
Speaker 1: After a controlled study, you gotta get a whole bunch of Washingtons, and a whole bunch of Rasputins, and then poison half of them.

496
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,184
Speaker 0: The other thing is that Rasputin came way later, right?

497
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:25,747
Speaker 0: So...

498
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,370
Speaker 1: Rasputin still right at the end of the era of the doctors would have killed him if they tried to save him.

499
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,270
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, he came way later than Washington.

500
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:40,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like Hank Green said, 1940 is your baseline for pre- and post-medicine existence.

501
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rasputin was dead in 1940.

502
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,329
Speaker 0: Already dead.

503
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,589
Speaker 1: So you got a thing of the day for me?

504
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:46,173
Speaker 0: I do.

505
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:49,150
Speaker 0: So there's this dude, he's I guess called the samurai guitarist.

506
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,367
Speaker 0: And he's playing one of the great songs of all time, "Here Comes the Sun" by Los Beatles.

507
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,269
Speaker 1: Real good song.

508
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:56,928
Speaker 0: Good song.

509
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:58,818
Speaker 0: And he starts playing the song at 5.24 AM.

510
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,590
Speaker 0: You can see, because in the video of him playing the song, there's a clock in the bottom left corner.

511
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,282
Speaker 0: And he finishes playing the song at around, oh, 5.50 something.

512
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,930
Speaker 0: So it takes him a half hour to play this, you know, few minute song.

513
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,990
Speaker 0: So he basically plays it real slow-like.

514
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,166
Speaker 0: And you know, the song goes doo doo doo doo.

515
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,842
Speaker 0: So he's like, doo, doo, doo.

516
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,857
Speaker 0: You know, even slower than that, right?

517
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:29,310
Speaker 0: Because it takes him 30 minutes to play the song once on the guitar.

518
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:29,849
Speaker 1: Yup.

519
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,350
Speaker 0: And he videos himself playing the song over the course of 30 minutes.

520
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,033
Speaker 0: Right?

521
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,110
Speaker 0: With a clock in the corner.

522
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,370
Speaker 0: And then what he'd do, be the work of genius.

523
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,062
Speaker 0: Obviously he was doing this between 5.24 and 5.50 because the sun was coming up.

524
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,229
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, the sun comes up as he's playing, right?

525
00:29:46,694 --> 00:29:47,129
Speaker 0: Makes sense.

526
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:50,449
Speaker 0: He makes a little time lapse of the video.

527
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,414
Speaker 0: Oooh.

528
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,670
Speaker 0: So it sounds like he's playing normal.

529
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:55,229
Speaker 1: And the sun's just coming up.

530
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,110
Speaker 0: And the sun's coming up.

531
00:29:56,615 --> 00:29:58,289
Speaker 0: So he made an A+ internet video.

532
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,990
Speaker 0: This is one of those things where it's like, I could have done that if I would have thought to do it.

533
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,815
Speaker 0: But you didn't.

534
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,709
Speaker 0: And that's why the Samurai Guitarist is better than you.

535
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:08,060
Speaker 0: So watch his video.

536
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,149
Speaker 0: He deserves your view.

537
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,890
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the Book Club book will be Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

538
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:16,290
Speaker 1: Because I'm finally almost done with The Wheel of Time.

539
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:17,929
Speaker 1: I just finished the 13th book.

540
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,949
Speaker 1: And I know what's in that tower now.

541
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,269
Speaker 0: Tell me what's in there.

542
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:21,572
Speaker 1: No.

543
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:22,229
Speaker 1: Read the books.

544
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,349
Speaker 1: I also know.

545
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:24,489
Speaker 1: Just tell me.

546
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,989
Speaker 1: I don't know fully what Luz Theron fucked up.

547
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,869
Speaker 1: But I know mostly what he fucked up.

548
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:29,921
Speaker 1: And I know where...

549
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,610
Speaker 0: Luz Theron, as far as I know from reading only books four, was the man.

550
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:35,029
Speaker 1: I know how the taint worked.

551
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,329
Speaker 1: Like, I know that biz now.

552
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,409
Speaker 0: It's between your legs.

553
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:38,494
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,150
Speaker 1: Well, it's also in your brain with spikes.

555
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,038
Speaker 0: Okay.

556
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,469
Speaker 1: I know the deal with a lot of things.

557
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,568
Speaker 0: Tell me all the things.

558
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,390
Speaker 1: You know, the problem is, I wasn't going to read all The Wheel of Time.

559
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:50,730
Speaker 1: I got to a point around book seven.

560
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:52,670
Speaker 0: Well, that was my Book Club pick, by the way.

561
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:52,776
Speaker 0: Yeah.

562
00:30:53,453 --> 00:31:03,010
Speaker 1: I'm going to read... Well, it's interesting because now that I've read it all, going back to The Prince of Nothing, I see where he drew tropes there as well.

563
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,809
Speaker 1: Like, you can't just look...

564
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,690
Speaker 0: Fantasy books have similar tropes, you don't say.

565
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:17,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but by focusing on the Tolkien tropes that are lifted, we've overlooked other tropes that didn't come from Tolkien-esque history of fantasy.

566
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:17,950
Speaker 0: Okay.

567
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,749
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm going to finish the 14th book because I had to.

568
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:25,990
Speaker 1: And we're going to do a special podcast, me and Cahill White at PAX Prime, about the.

569
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,869
Speaker 0: It's going to be great if this podcast doesn't happen.

570
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,788
Speaker 0: You hyped it up so much.

571
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,710
Speaker 1: It's going to happen because he was into it.

572
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,208
Speaker 1: Believe me, when I tweet about The Wheel of Time, there are two people who respond to those tweets.

573
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,170
Speaker 1: And 90% of the time, it's Summerando and Cahill.

574
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:40,630
Speaker 1: All right.

575
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:41,830
Speaker 1: He is into Wheel of Time.

576
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:49,450
Speaker 1: In fact, after I said that The Prince of Nothing is The Wheel of Time, times... What did I say?

577
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,030
Speaker 1: I said something.

578
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,050
Speaker 1: But basically I was like, Prince of Nothing is the real mode version of Wheel of Time.

579
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,810
Speaker 0: I mean, every fantasy book is every other fantasy book.

580
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

581
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,690
Speaker 1: But I think he's going to read The Prince of Nothing now.

582
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,825
Speaker 1: You didn't read it already?

583
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:01,567
Speaker 0: No.

584
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:06,129
Speaker 1: A lot of people haven't read The Prince of Nothing because you start that stuff and it is dense.

585
00:32:06,697 --> 00:32:07,330
Speaker 1: It is brutal.

586
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,330
Speaker 1: It makes the Game of Thrones look like a children's story.

587
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,704
Speaker 0: Game of Thrones is a children's story.

588
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:15,630
Speaker 0: So is Wheel of Time.

589
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,789
Speaker 1: Kineticon's coming up.

590
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,249
Speaker 1: We'll be doing a bunch of shows there.

591
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,290
Speaker 1: We're also rapidly scheduling the panels.

592
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,090
Speaker 1: I cannot tell you when the panel schedule will appear on the website.

593
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:25,569
Speaker 1: I have no control over that.

594
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:33,450
Speaker 1: But I have scheduled about three quarters of the convention and someone else is emailing people who have panels scheduled.

595
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,490
Speaker 1: If you didn't get an email yet, it doesn't mean I didn't schedule you yet.

596
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,769
Speaker 1: It just means there's a lot of follow up to do because there's a lot of manual processes this year for reasons I have no control over.

597
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:43,968
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

598
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,169
Speaker 1: Otherwise, PAX Prime is coming up.

599
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:47,787
Speaker 1: We'll be there.

600
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,504
Speaker 1: PAX Dev.

601
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,628
Speaker 1: I'll be there at least.

602
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,330
Speaker 1: And yeah.

603
00:32:53,153 --> 00:32:53,728
Speaker 1: Any other stuff?

604
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,927
Speaker 0: Patreon's going.

605
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,430
Speaker 1: Still selling t-shirts.

606
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,790
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of video equipment.

607
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,869
Speaker 0: I'm going to make a whole bunch of videos that are free on YouTube soon.

608
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,770
Speaker 0: Streaming and also not streaming.

609
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,930
Speaker 1: The third game, you know, we've been doing our Civ series.

610
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,569
Speaker 1: The problem is I can't upload videos from a game until the game's over because I can't reveal information to Scott and vice versa.

611
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:17,910
Speaker 1: But the third series, pretty interesting shit's going down.

612
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,950
Speaker 1: I actually can't wait to see what Scott saw over the course of this game.

613
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:24,669
Speaker 0: I saw your pike man to the north of me.

614
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,450
Speaker 1: Oh, that's actually, I don't have a pike man.

615
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do.

616
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,724
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

617
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:30,509
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's a pike man.

618
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:31,749
Speaker 1: No, it's a sword man.

619
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,490
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess he's standing next to the pike.

620
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,089
Speaker 1: The city state has a pike man.

621
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:38,069
Speaker 0: Oh, is that who that belongs to?

622
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:38,428
Speaker 0: Yeah.

623
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,550
Speaker 1: That's not the city state I'm allied with either.

624
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:48,287
Speaker 1: So all the city states that declared war on you are actually on the other side of me and literally can't interact with you.

625
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,926
Speaker 1: So I like the two that are next to you that I wanted to declare war on.

626
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:54,990
Speaker 1: you have quests that are literally impossible.

627
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,830
Speaker 1: One of them is like, give me some marble.

628
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,270
Speaker 1: And the only marble on the map is like next to your capital.

629
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's my marble and they're not asking for it.

630
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're asking for it from me and I can't give it to them.

631
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would give them the marble.

632
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,250
Speaker 0: No problem.

633
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:10,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like, we need to get some marble room marble.

634
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:15,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I built my game around that marble and my plan went according to plan.

635
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,909
Speaker 0: But basically I learned that in a dual military is all that matters and nothing else really does.

636
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,549
Speaker 1: Thing is, I can't take Scott out.

637
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:23,808
Speaker 1: I know I can't do.

638
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,688
Speaker 0: No, I got my Babylonian walls.

639
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:26,467
Speaker 0: Come and bring it.

640
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaker 1: Not only that, but you're one era ahead of me science wise.

641
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:35,648
Speaker 1: And one of the things that you might not know is that city defense is heavily influenced by what era you reach.

642
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:36,030
Speaker 0: Right.

643
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,263
Speaker 0: But you think I think if you brought your whole military to bear, I can't.

644
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:44,929
Speaker 0: I can't exert my force on anything right now, not even barbarians, because I don't have enough force.

645
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,310
Speaker 1: There are so many goddamn barbarians.

646
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,869
Speaker 0: And I don't I know and I don't have enough money to to get more.

647
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,489
Speaker 0: I could build more military easily.

648
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:54,230
Speaker 0: I just don't have money to pay for it.

649
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,010
Speaker 1: Scott, you need some money.

650
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,069
Speaker 1: I'll give you money for your marble.

651
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,030
Speaker 0: No, not for the marble.

652
00:35:00,751 --> 00:35:04,530
Speaker 0: So it's like if I could just get some fucking money, I would be actually like really good.

653
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,989
Speaker 0: But there's nowhere I can send a caravan safely.

654
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,870
Speaker 0: I can't caravan.

655
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,470
Speaker 1: There's one place you could, but not for long.

656
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:13,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't caravan basically.

657
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,890
Speaker 1: I only have one caravan and I only made that caravan because the city state asked for it.

658
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:24,630
Speaker 0: This is why China was so good when I played it, because you get two money from your library and that I'm actually at like minus two money.

659
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:24,966
Speaker 0: Exactly.

660
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,570
Speaker 0: Like it's like, oh, I just was China.

661
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:28,928
Speaker 0: I would be so good right now.

662
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,169
Speaker 1: Well, even worse in the big Civ game, the worst fucking thing happened to me.

663
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,649
Speaker 1: I might declare war on Chris and Egypt because of it.

664
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:37,450
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of wonders.

665
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,170
Speaker 1: You know the wonders like no one builds like Chichen Itza or whatever, just hanging out.

666
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,669
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

667
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:41,869
Speaker 1: It is a good one, but no one built it.

668
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,930
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of wonders no one built.

669
00:35:43,552 --> 00:35:45,589
Speaker 1: I had a great engineer and I was like, you know what?

670
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:50,370
Speaker 1: I'm just going to in one turn build Chichen Itza.

671
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:51,448
Speaker 0: He built it under you.

672
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,848
Speaker 1: He literally had been working on it for a while and finished it.

673
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,909
Speaker 1: The turn.

674
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,430
Speaker 1: I used my great engineer.

675
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,630
Speaker 0: It's that early in the game.

676
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,589
Speaker 0: Why don't you use your great engineer to make the factory?

677
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:04,270
Speaker 1: The factory is not available yet.

678
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,088
Speaker 0: The manufactory.

679
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:06,408
Speaker 1: The manufactory?

680
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,729
Speaker 0: The thing he builds on the terrain.

681
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:13,774
Speaker 1: Oh, so I am more ties that over the hammers in terms of how long I think the game will go.

682
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,101
Speaker 1: Probably not worth it.

683
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,550
Speaker 0: If it's early in the game, I would build that.

684
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:26,330
Speaker 1: I will do that with the science one or the money one, but very rarely will I build the manufactory because instead I'll just mine all the hills I got around.

685
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,261
Speaker 1: But anyway, I digress.

686
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:30,687
Speaker 0: All right.

687
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,630
Speaker 1: So Scott told me to watch a bunch of anime and I told him to watch a bunch of anime and neither one of us watched the anime that the other one watch, except I think we both watched Sakamoto.

688
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,233
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

689
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,650
Speaker 0: But why didn't you watch any of the things I told you to watch?

690
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,230
Speaker 1: I didn't watch... Chichen Daisuke is only 50 minutes long.

691
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,049
Speaker 0: That's been around for a long time.

692
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:46,302
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,870
Speaker 1: And it's going to not be on Hulu like tomorrow.

694
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,730
Speaker 0: But there's plenty of ways to watch it without Hulu.

695
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,464
Speaker 0: Name one.

696
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:53,766
Speaker 0: BitTorrent.

697
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:54,910
Speaker 1: He's going to pirate.

698
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,070
Speaker 1: It's getting harder unless you really know where to go.

699
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,090
Speaker 1: I mean, I could pirate it, obviously, but most people probably couldn't without going.

700
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,869
Speaker 0: It's not my problem.

701
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,190
Speaker 1: More and more people I see are pirating stuff by going to those shady...

702
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:09,810
Speaker 0: Also, as many animes, people are like panicking because all the anime are removed from Hulu.

703
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,290
Speaker 1: It's all like Saber, Marionette, J.

704
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:19,949
Speaker 0: I have a bunch of anime in my queue on Hulu, and I only got an email from Hulu saying that one of them was being removed, which is the second season of Mushishi, which is like, all right.

705
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,210
Speaker 1: Scott, you don't understand.

706
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,370
Speaker 1: It is Lupin's season because we went back and finished Fuji Go Mine.

707
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:27,070
Speaker 0: I like me a Lupin, but I'm not in Lupin mood right now.

708
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:28,710
Speaker 1: But this is a new Lupin.

709
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:36,840
Speaker 1: This blue-shirted Lupin that we're seeing in Fuji Go Mine and now in Jigendaisuke is, it's a way to do Lupin.

710
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:38,650
Speaker 1: that I think is making Lupin.

711
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,990
Speaker 1: Lupin's going to be big again, like real big.

712
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,510
Speaker 0: I mean, it's probably good, but I don't need to watch it right now.

713
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,209
Speaker 0: It's not going anywhere.

714
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,109
Speaker 1: But it's so good.

715
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:47,248
Speaker 1: Just watch it.

716
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,709
Speaker 1: We could do a whole show on it.

717
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,068
Speaker 1: What's my hurry?

718
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,129
Speaker 1: It's a whole Wednesday show.

719
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,710
Speaker 0: We could have done many Wednesday shows if you were to watch the four anime that I'm watching.

720
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:01,890
Speaker 1: I watched way more minutes of anime than I did, and we could have done a whole show just on that 51 minutes of anime.

721
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:03,070
Speaker 0: Yeah.

722
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,250
Speaker 0: Well, you told me to watch it way too late.

723
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,949
Speaker 0: I told you to watch this shit way long ago.

724
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,283
Speaker 0: Yeah.

725
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,270
Speaker 1: The problem has been playing Overwatch and watching Fargo.

726
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:13,570
Speaker 1: We can do a show on Fargo if you watch it.

727
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,809
Speaker 0: It's really, really good.

728
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,321
Speaker 0: Yeah.

729
00:38:15,874 --> 00:38:16,410
Speaker 1: It's Coen Brothers.

730
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,550
Speaker 1: It's not like a spinoff.

731
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:21,650
Speaker 1: It's Coen Brothers made more stories like Fargo and they made it as a serial.

732
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,210
Speaker 1: It's great.

733
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:22,829
Speaker 0: Don't care.

734
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:23,890
Speaker 1: All right.

735
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,788
Speaker 1: Guess you don't like things.

736
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:32,190
Speaker 1: So tell what's one of these animes I should have watched that I didn't other than Sakamoto because the first one you got to watch is Space Patrol Luluco.

737
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,364
Speaker 0: That is the show, right?

738
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,450
Speaker 0: So Trigger basically is sort of working on two shows this season, right?

739
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,530
Speaker 0: Space Patrol Luluco and Kizniver.

740
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,350
Speaker 0: And basically imagine Kill La Kill, the center of all the Trigger universe, right?

741
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:56,130
Speaker 0: And now split it into two parts, the zany part, which is the part of the reason you like Trigger and the normal anime part.

742
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:03,569
Speaker 0: And the normal anime part became Kizniver and Space Patrol Luluco is like, it's like Inferno Cop distilled.

743
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,530
Speaker 0: Inferno Cop's even in it.

744
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,824
Speaker 1: Inferno Cop is already vodka.

745
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,049
Speaker 1: It's already distilled.

746
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,808
Speaker 1: So what's this?

747
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:11,668
Speaker 0: Just fucking moonshine.

748
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,689
Speaker 0: It's just fucking moonshine.

749
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,230
Speaker 1: It's just crystal meth dissolved.

750
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,430
Speaker 0: So the story, Space Patrol Luluco isn't even a full TV series.

751
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,126
Speaker 0: It's short episodes like fucking Tamagotobutsu where the opener and the closer is longer than the show.

752
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:30,750
Speaker 1: It's interesting because if I look at my Twitter feed, the Kizniver is getting like 80% of all the anime love I'm seeing.

753
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,099
Speaker 0: I watched one episode.

754
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,150
Speaker 0: I don't need to watch anymore.

755
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,249
Speaker 1: My Twitter feed loves it.

756
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,690
Speaker 0: But anyway, the Space Patrol Luluco, right?

757
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:49,850
Speaker 0: So the story is there's a crazy town, which is a lot like sort of like the Men in Black alien town where it's like just all kinds of crossroads of the galaxy kind of place.

758
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:51,330
Speaker 0: And it's crazy.

759
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:57,130
Speaker 0: And there's a girl who lives there and she's normal and she wants things to be normal, but she lives in a crazy town and it's crazy.

760
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,667
Speaker 0: So her dad is in the Space Patrol and he's like the awesomest Space Patrol dude.

761
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:03,430
Speaker 0: He's pretty much dad from Kill La Kill.

762
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:07,250
Speaker 0: But he's in the Space Patrol and he's like the hero of the Space Patrol.

763
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,370
Speaker 0: The chief of the Space Patrol is Inferno Cop.

764
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:11,550
Speaker 0: Anyway.

765
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:14,090
Speaker 1: Oh, it is just Inferno Cop, but he's wearing those sunglasses.

766
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,406
Speaker 0: Yes, it's Inferno Cop.

767
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:16,704
Speaker 0: Anyway.

768
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,790
Speaker 0: And the main girl is basically, um, what's her name?

769
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:22,390
Speaker 0: From Kill La Kill.

770
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,089
Speaker 1: You forgot the names of every single character in Kill La Kill, didn't you?

771
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:25,485
Speaker 0: Yes.

772
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:26,810
Speaker 1: Every character?

773
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:28,327
Speaker 0: Yes.

774
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,009
Speaker 0: Yes.

775
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:31,768
Speaker 0: All of them.

776
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,248
Speaker 0: Anyway.

777
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:36,308
Speaker 0: Is it Maho?

778
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:36,865
Speaker 0: Whatever.

779
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,405
Speaker 0: Is that her name?

780
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:39,069
Speaker 0: The crazy one.

781
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:39,790
Speaker 1: Yup.

782
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,409
Speaker 0: Anyway.

783
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,429
Speaker 0: It's basically her.

784
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:48,808
Speaker 0: And basically dad gets fucked up, uh, through like his body gets frozen and his only- Like Han Solo style?

785
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:49,748
Speaker 0: In ice.

786
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,050
Speaker 0: But yeah, his brain is like, the slice of his brain is the only thing left or whatever.

787
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:58,510
Speaker 0: And so this girl joins the Space Patrol and has to deal with Space Patrol nonsense.

788
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:06,390
Speaker 0: And he gets crazy go nuts and they go to Kill La Kill planet and they go to, right, you know, they go to Little Witch Academia planet.

789
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:11,270
Speaker 0: It just goes, the show is out of control, zaniness that you need in your anime life.

790
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,630
Speaker 0: And it's short episodes.

791
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,070
Speaker 0: You can watch the whole thing, right?

792
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,050
Speaker 0: And you know, all the episodes that are out so far.

793
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:27,310
Speaker 0: And it's funny cause like you watch three episodes and like the fourth episode would be like, season two, episode one, it's like it's seasons, but there's only been like seven or eight episodes so far, but it's already the third season just ended.

794
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:33,210
Speaker 1: I can just squeeze it in then because it's, it's, there's very low barrier to entry to watch a show like that.

795
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,430
Speaker 1: Like Inferno Cop, like once you turn it on, you're like, oh, okay.

796
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:35,555
Speaker 1: Yeah.

797
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:36,910
Speaker 0: You can watch this whole thing.

798
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,387
Speaker 0: Like by the time I leave here.

799
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,370
Speaker 1: Cause Sakamoto is kind of like though, it kind of just keeps going, just like, well, Sakamoto shoots.

800
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,270
Speaker 0: So Sakamoto I watched because the trailer was so epic, right?

801
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:52,070
Speaker 1: And Sakamoto, while good, is not what I, you don't get any more out of it by watching it than by just reading the manga.

802
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:52,989
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

803
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,850
Speaker 0: So the manga I think is even worse than the anime.

804
00:41:56,071 --> 00:42:00,130
Speaker 0: So Sakamoto gives me that feel that I get from like, I was a manga dio, right?

805
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,209
Speaker 0: With the way the school feels, there's a cast of characters in the school and the sort of pacing and the way it's edited.

806
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:13,989
Speaker 0: But also sort of like Cromartie, but less crazy than Cromartie, but still Cromartie cause you got thuggish bully kid, you know, kind of action going on.

807
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:23,329
Speaker 1: It's like Cromartie, but there's only one, like there aren't like there's like in Cromartie, everyone except the main guy has some crazy thing going on and this is pretty much just Sakamoto.

808
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:24,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

809
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,727
Speaker 1: Pretty much like everyone else is normal-ish.

810
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:35,110
Speaker 0: Um, the, uh, you know, as a little bit of the zaniness of like, uh, you know, the Nichijou kind of action.

811
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:35,290
Speaker 0: Right.

812
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,890
Speaker 0: But anyway, so Sakamoto, it is what it says it was about, right?

813
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:46,050
Speaker 0: It's about this kid who's like, you know, super good at everything, but he's also kind of weird.

814
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,430
Speaker 0: Like he's like, I'm thinking there's some plot to it.

815
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,090
Speaker 0: Like he's alien.

816
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,745
Speaker 0: He's gotta be like, he's an alien or he's a bird cause he's always hanging out with birds and stuff.

817
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,029
Speaker 1: He's an alien bird alien.

818
00:42:54,611 --> 00:42:56,490
Speaker 0: He's like an alien to investigate high schools.

819
00:42:56,811 --> 00:43:00,270
Speaker 0: There's something going on there that's kind of weird and sort of offsetting.

820
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,129
Speaker 0: He's not just like this hero that you root for.

821
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:08,690
Speaker 0: He's just sort of like this strange character who just coincidentally is bad-ass at everything somehow.

822
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,170
Speaker 0: It's like, what's up with that?

823
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:17,050
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, so the feel that you get, the vibe that comes from it isn't exactly the vibe that I got from the trailer.

824
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,666
Speaker 1: Yeah.

825
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:21,030
Speaker 1: Uh, you're expecting more like initial D style.

826
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,409
Speaker 1: Like he just wins all the time.

827
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:22,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

828
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:24,388
Speaker 1: And there's nothing wrong with it.

829
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:31,970
Speaker 0: And then in the manga, the thing with the manga is basically the same exact material and you can actually digest it much faster if you read the manga.

830
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,810
Speaker 0: But the manga, it's like the, it's really compressed compared to the anime.

831
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,070
Speaker 1: Which I kind of like cause the anime just feels sort of drawn out.

832
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,730
Speaker 0: No, I kind of liked that it's drawn out cause then you can actually get the feel of the whole situation.

833
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:49,490
Speaker 0: When you compress it, it's like the timing of the jokes are just off and they're not funny at all.

834
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,148
Speaker 1: You know what it might be?

835
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,630
Speaker 1: I actually read a bunch of the manga before I went back and watched the anime.

836
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,729
Speaker 1: I feel like you got to pick one of the two.

837
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,789
Speaker 0: I did the reverse.

838
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,826
Speaker 1: That's it.

839
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,503
Speaker 1: You got whichever one you do, if you do the manga or the anime, the other one is worthless to you.

840
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:04,110
Speaker 0: Maybe.

841
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,470
Speaker 0: But yeah, uh, I prefer the anime.

842
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:09,609
Speaker 0: I'm not going to buy any more of the manga and I'll just keep watching it.

843
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:13,970
Speaker 0: But it's not, it's, it's worth watching, but it's not like must watch.

844
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,986
Speaker 0: You could just, if you haven't seen, say, Ozamanga Daioh or Cromartie, you should go there first.

845
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:24,249
Speaker 1: So the anime that I watched and Emily watched it with me was, and we watched the entire thing.

846
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,248
Speaker 0: How many episodes is it?

847
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:25,945
Speaker 1: Uh, eight.

848
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:28,409
Speaker 1: Oh no, eight volumes, 12 episodes of anime.

849
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,129
Speaker 0: So it's not bad.

850
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:29,610
Speaker 1: Half season.

851
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:30,229
Speaker 1: Okay.

852
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,670
Speaker 1: You could burn through it actually.

853
00:44:31,851 --> 00:44:34,450
Speaker 1: Cause it's very, it's, it's, it just moves quickly.

854
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,349
Speaker 1: So we actually reviewed it fully on the Patreon, but basically it's called erased.

855
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:41,129
Speaker 0: and isn't that an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?

856
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:42,410
Speaker 1: That's eraser.

857
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,630
Speaker 1: You're thinking of what's the difference a lot.

858
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,230
Speaker 1: This doesn't have sub supersonic bullets in quotes.

859
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:49,929
Speaker 1: Was that eraser?

860
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:56,688
Speaker 1: I think eraser had these supersonic bullets like night arrows, but this thing ended in March.

861
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,489
Speaker 1: Like it's a recent anime and it's all just out.

862
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:03,750
Speaker 1: But the story is basically there's a kid and he has his normal life.

863
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,390
Speaker 1: He's kind of a loser.

864
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,968
Speaker 1: Like he's our age.

865
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:05,428
Speaker 1: He's a loser.

866
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:06,530
Speaker 1: Not like a loser.

867
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:10,070
Speaker 1: Like he sucks, but like he's got kind of a dead end job and he's just living his life.

868
00:45:10,151 --> 00:45:12,330
Speaker 1: and he's kind of an artist, like a failed manga artist or whatever.

869
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:14,190
Speaker 1: But he has a superpower.

870
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:20,929
Speaker 1: No one else seems to have a superpower where sometimes he'll just see a butterfly go by and then suddenly deja vu.

871
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:25,910
Speaker 1: He goes back in time like a couple of minutes and something's wrong.

872
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,130
Speaker 1: Like that was a moment where something that was going to go bad could be fixed.

873
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:35,909
Speaker 1: So like he's riding his little scooter and then suddenly he sees the butterflies and he backs up.

874
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,669
Speaker 1: She's like, Oh shit.

875
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:37,930
Speaker 1: So now he's paying attention.

876
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,830
Speaker 1: Like what's weird.

877
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:40,150
Speaker 1: What's out of place.

878
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:48,149
Speaker 1: And then he notices that the truck that was next to him, the driver is literally just like passed out and the truck's just like careening down the road, which he didn't notice before.

879
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:50,909
Speaker 1: So that's like the setup.

880
00:45:51,731 --> 00:46:01,450
Speaker 1: And then some crazy Phoenix Wright shit goes down and he goes back in time after being reminded about a bunch of murders that happened when he was a kid.

881
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:05,869
Speaker 1: And he goes back in time all the way to when he was in grade school.

882
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:10,030
Speaker 0: And but he still has his adult mind, all his adult memories, all his adult mind.

883
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:17,230
Speaker 1: And he's back in time and he has the, like, you know, think about how fuzzy your memories are of like third or fourth or fifth grade.

884
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:17,670
Speaker 0: Yeah.

885
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:23,770
Speaker 1: So he wakes up in his body in that, like in that era, kid body, adult body, kid body.

886
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:29,788
Speaker 1: But he has the adult memories of, wait a minute, some people I kind of knew got like kidnapped and murdered.

887
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:31,449
Speaker 0: I get some good grades, man.

888
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:32,610
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

889
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:43,829
Speaker 1: He basically doesn't give a shit about school, but, and he remembers specifically this one girl who he didn't know, but he kind of remembered like the, like these kids looks like a serial killer murdered these kids.

890
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:48,250
Speaker 1: And like the parents and adults tried to like hush it up so the kids wouldn't be traumatized.

891
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:54,148
Speaker 1: But he remembers that like right before the girl got murdered, he remembers seeing her alone in the park.

892
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:57,970
Speaker 1: So he makes it his mission to prevent the serial killings.

893
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,350
Speaker 1: And holy shit does this show go off the rails in a really good way.

894
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,390
Speaker 0: Like you think he is the serial killer.

895
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,148
Speaker 0: I figured it all out.

896
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:13,670
Speaker 1: Uh, watch your show, but it's one of those shows that pretty much every episode ends.

897
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,309
Speaker 1: So Scott, here's how to make it a little bit crazier.

898
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:27,187
Speaker 1: In English, the official name of the show is erased, but the actual Japanese name of the show is the guy, the main character is the serial killer is the town where only I am missing.

899
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:41,970
Speaker 1: And that's the name of a short story that a character wrote when that character was a kid about how the world would have been better if that character didn't exist or didn't exist in the place they existed because he wouldn't have killed that girl.

900
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:44,809
Speaker 1: This the watch your show.

901
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,990
Speaker 1: The show is not what you think, except I'm right.

902
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:47,608
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

903
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

904
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,467
Speaker 1: Now watch your show.

905
00:47:50,592 --> 00:47:53,310
Speaker 1: The show is crazy good though.

906
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:55,010
Speaker 1: And it's only 12 episodes long.

907
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:56,670
Speaker 1: Every episode ends on a cliffhanger.

908
00:47:57,052 --> 00:48:00,189
Speaker 1: And every time you think, all right, I know what's going on.

909
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:04,606
Speaker 1: Some Phoenix Wright crap happens, then you're like, well, I was 100% wrong.

910
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,569
Speaker 1: And it, it, it's just really good.

911
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:09,690
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

912
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:11,970
Speaker 1: Once you watch a couple episodes, you're just going to watch the whole thing.

913
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,126
Speaker 1: Like you can't stop yourself.

914
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:15,950
Speaker 1: Watch anything else?

915
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:16,244
Speaker 0: I did.

916
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:16,947
Speaker 0: I watched a lot of stuff.

917
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:21,729
Speaker 0: So I watched this, but you remember there was that one about like the people on the bus that go to lost village.

918
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,010
Speaker 1: The one that we had a vague Bocurano-esque feeling about.

919
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:25,768
Speaker 0: That one.

920
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:26,709
Speaker 0: So I watched that.

921
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,269
Speaker 0: I've watched every episode so far.

922
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,889
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest thing ever, but it's pretty good.

923
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:38,840
Speaker 0: And it sort of has this balance where like, they're not telling you enough of the mystery, but they do tell you enough of the mystery.

924
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:44,829
Speaker 0: at the same time where it's like, you're not telling enough, but you're telling enough that you're not jerking me around.

925
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:45,610
Speaker 0: Right.

926
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,387
Speaker 1: All right.

927
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:56,730
Speaker 0: And basically it's, it's exactly, you know, a bunch of characters get on a bus and the main problem I have with the show is the characters in that a lot of them are kind of zany, right?

928
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:08,250
Speaker 0: There's like guy who dresses up like a pirate and thinks he's a pirate and this girl who's like an who's thinks she's an idol and basically is constantly yelling, like, "Execute everybody!

929
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,410
Speaker 0: Oh my God, execute everybody!

930
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:09,887
Speaker 0: Kill them!

931
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:10,195
Speaker 0: Oh my

932
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:10,544
Speaker 0: God!".

933
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:10,921
Speaker 0: Right?

934
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:11,270
Speaker 0: Yeah.

935
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:20,147
Speaker 1: Because while they're not similar, except in our superficial look at one screenshot in Bocurano, the characters are all different, but they were like, "This kid's no Taku and this girl's like, she plays the

936
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:20,390
Speaker 1: piano.".

937
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they weren't extreme hyperbole stereotype caricatures.

938
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,643
Speaker 0: They were like, "This girl murders people with

939
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:26,369
Speaker 0: pianos.".

940
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:26,850
Speaker 0: Right.

941
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,790
Speaker 0: They were like normal.

942
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,350
Speaker 0: They seemed like normal people in Bocurano that just were different, had different personalities.

943
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:36,210
Speaker 0: These are like extreme anime personalities, each different character, right?

944
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:37,609
Speaker 0: So it was like two gun nuts.

945
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,826
Speaker 0: The girl who's like, "Meow,

946
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:38,969
Speaker 0: meow.".

947
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,030
Speaker 1: Two gun nuts!

948
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,166
Speaker 0: This is a girl who's kind of like making meow, cat noises, right?

949
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:45,569
Speaker 1: We knew someone like that at RIT, so.

950
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:45,816
Speaker 1: Yeah.

951
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:46,601
Speaker 1: YMMV.

952
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,910
Speaker 0: But you know, like she says meow at the end of every like sentence or whatever, right?

953
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:58,490
Speaker 0: There's all these weird characters in there and like, it's all, you know, that sort of, I think sort of makes it a little chintzy, right?

954
00:49:59,014 --> 00:49:59,769
Speaker 0: And less serious.

955
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:10,149
Speaker 0: But it's also like these people go to this village in the middle of nowhere and you know, they find it and crazy shit happens there and it's a mystery of like, what's the deal with this village?

956
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,010
Speaker 0: Well, what's through the mysterious tunnel?

957
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,829
Speaker 0: You know, where did that guy disappear to?

958
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:22,109
Speaker 0: And it gives me sort of the same feel you get from like playing one of those video games, like nine doors, nine persons kind of thing.

959
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:28,950
Speaker 1: You know, actually Erased will give you a similar feeling because you're really, really trying to figure it out and they give you a lot of clues.

960
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:42,036
Speaker 0: And it also feels like a little bit of paranoia agent, though clearly not anywhere near as good, but at least the mystery part of like, you know, because when you're thinking about like what's the deal with this village, it almost feels like what's the deal with Shounen Bed?

961
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:45,843
Speaker 1: It's a shame you never didn't watch Inasekiyori from the New World.

962
00:50:45,903 --> 00:50:53,770
Speaker 1: because what I would ask you is, is the mystery like like, is it more or less that kind of mystery?

963
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:54,454
Speaker 0: It's definitely it's.

964
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:56,430
Speaker 0: it's definitely a supernatural mystery, for sure.

965
00:50:56,672 --> 00:50:58,270
Speaker 0: It's not something that's just normal.

966
00:50:58,572 --> 00:50:59,397
Speaker 1: But is it going to be like?

967
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:03,549
Speaker 1: what's the deal with the town is going to be like, what's the deal with the world in which this town exists?

968
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:05,050
Speaker 0: It could be both.

969
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:13,769
Speaker 0: It's also like there's a lot focusing on like each character having a troubled past and like their past is related to like, are they all on the bus because they have troubled past?

970
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:14,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

971
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:16,489
Speaker 1: You know, that's why they're all.

972
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:21,569
Speaker 0: And then there's obviously the one magical girl who doesn't have a troubled past that she doesn't see monsters or whatever.

973
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:21,967
Speaker 1: She had.

974
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,666
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

975
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:22,958
Speaker 1: OK.

976
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,670
Speaker 0: And she might be a ghost.

977
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,530
Speaker 0: It's just like there's all this stuff that like it's their body.

978
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,989
Speaker 0: There's all this stuff that like might be or might not be.

979
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,450
Speaker 0: And it's like they don't confirm anything.

980
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:33,690
Speaker 0: And the characters are all like detectives on their own.

981
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,270
Speaker 0: Like everyone's got a different theory.

982
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:41,168
Speaker 0: You know, they're always talking about stuff and forming different parties and going to different locations with each other.

983
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,270
Speaker 0: You know, all that kind of stuff.

984
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,629
Speaker 1: Actually, Erase does a lot of that as well.

985
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:49,410
Speaker 1: And also is very good at like every character at all.

986
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,569
Speaker 1: Well, it'll give you moments of like a bunch of evidence, like, all right, something's up with that character, something possibly bad.

987
00:51:57,871 --> 00:52:02,370
Speaker 0: So, yeah, those are all the shows that like I've been watching, like every episode of.

988
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,190
Speaker 0: But I watched one of this one show I'm going to watch more episodes of.

989
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,830
Speaker 0: I just have it, which is the Joker game.

990
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:09,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was one.

991
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,369
Speaker 1: That was the one I was second most looking forward to.

992
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:15,230
Speaker 1: So it looked like a series shows the one I was the most looking.

993
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:22,289
Speaker 0: I watched a few episodes of The Witch Show, but it's just like The Witch Show is just like a nice, you know, ah, kind of show.

994
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:24,709
Speaker 0: So it's like I only watch it.

995
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:25,935
Speaker 0: It's like I'm just not.

996
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:28,950
Speaker 0: it's like there's no pressing needs like watch more episodes.

997
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,770
Speaker 0: It's not like a plot that really is pushing you.

998
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,890
Speaker 1: It's like like when I watch Nietzsche, Joe, it's like, well, that was amusing.

999
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,733
Speaker 0: It's just like.

1000
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:41,525
Speaker 0: it's just like if I need some, ah, I can always go back to The Witch Show, but there's no reason to like grind through it because it's like there's not like some plot you're trying to.

1001
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,570
Speaker 1: So it's Joker game look like it's going to go somewhere or is it going to be.

1002
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:46,149
Speaker 1: So they know your Jimbo.

1003
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:47,255
Speaker 0: So no, no, no.

1004
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:49,750
Speaker 0: So it has a similar aesthetic gangster.

1005
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,492
Speaker 1: Was that the other one?

1006
00:52:50,513 --> 00:52:56,133
Speaker 0: It has a similar feel kind of because, you know, Jimbo serious adult dudes.

1007
00:52:56,233 --> 00:53:05,029
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's so there's some sort of super secret spy organization and this guy is like the liaison to it of some kind.

1008
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,177
Speaker 0: It's like it's not.

1009
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:07,890
Speaker 0: I'm not entirely clear what his position is.

1010
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:08,211
Speaker 0: Right.

1011
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:16,050
Speaker 0: But and they're all these ultimate badasses who had the ultimate training and he goes, he's hanging out and there's a game of poker.

1012
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:16,676
Speaker 0: He's all right.

1013
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:17,708
Speaker 0: I'll play some poker with you.

1014
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:21,649
Speaker 0: And in the end of the poker game, it's like, no, no, no.

1015
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:23,170
Speaker 0: Actually, we weren't playing poker.

1016
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:28,055
Speaker 0: We were playing the Joker game where we totally were all messing with you and what, you know.

1017
00:53:28,565 --> 00:53:28,769
Speaker 0: Right.

1018
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:41,118
Speaker 0: And then immediately they start playing, you know, he gets played in the Joker game for real, where it's like all this total like espionage, deception, like you get set up big time.

1019
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:41,907
Speaker 0: And right.

1020
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:45,030
Speaker 0: So basically I'll spoil the first episode.

1021
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:45,410
Speaker 0: Right.

1022
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:50,833
Speaker 0: So there's something where they're like, oh, you know, this this guy is totally a spy.

1023
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:54,170
Speaker 0: We got to go to his house and investigate.

1024
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,030
Speaker 0: And they're like, no, let's not do that.

1025
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,809
Speaker 0: And he's like, no, we have orders to do it.

1026
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:58,774
Speaker 0: We're going to do it.

1027
00:53:59,116 --> 00:53:59,357
Speaker 0: Is that?

1028
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:10,530
Speaker 0: and the spy organization doesn't want to do it, but he forces them to do it, which is exactly what they wanted him to do, because when he gets there, they search his house and they didn't find anything.

1029
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,350
Speaker 0: And he's like, what do you mean you didn't find anything?

1030
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:15,710
Speaker 0: It's like this place was searched actually recently.

1031
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:20,950
Speaker 0: He didn't know that he got totally played in the Joker game.

1032
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:25,850
Speaker 0: And he said that he would, you know, commit a coup if he didn't find anything.

1033
00:54:26,374 --> 00:54:27,709
Speaker 0: And it's like, ha ha ha ha ha.

1034
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,530
Speaker 0: We totally tricked you into agreeing to kill yourself.

1035
00:54:30,874 --> 00:54:32,189
Speaker 0: And we knew nothing would be here.

1036
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:36,390
Speaker 0: We played you because we're super bad as some Akagi nonsense.

1037
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:37,689
Speaker 1: Which can be good.

1038
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,550
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1039
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:44,669
Speaker 0: And now he's all sweating like, oh, shit, I'm going to have to kill myself now, even though this guy's totally a double agent for it.

1040
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,990
Speaker 0: This guy's a spy for real.

1041
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,070
Speaker 0: No, it's that kind of right.

1042
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:55,016
Speaker 0: So it's all about that kind of situations with these crazy bad ass spy dudes and these kind of scenarios.

1043
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:58,128
Speaker 0: I don't know what episode two is going to be like, but that's what episode one was like.

1044
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:58,833
Speaker 0: All right.

1045
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:02,949
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I'll catch up with some of these shows and then we'll start doing like full reviews of them.

1046
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the one I'll watch immediately.

1047
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,214
Speaker 0: I hope they play.

1048
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:09,110
Speaker 0: I hope they do Joker games, stuff like that every episode.

1049
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,611
Speaker 0: Right.

1050
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:11,970
Speaker 0: Where it's like, oh, someone got played every episode.

1051
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:12,331
Speaker 0: Oh, sure.

1052
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,350
Speaker 1: The game just sounds the most different from things I have seen.

1053
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:15,912
Speaker 0: It's super.

1054
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:21,710
Speaker 1: It's way different from like all animes I've seen or at least stuff that I've seen recently, because there are shows that do that kind of thing.

1055
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:26,269
Speaker 0: I just haven't watched them or at least there's not a lot of things I can compare Joker game to that I've seen.

1056
00:55:26,811 --> 00:55:30,030
Speaker 0: It's almost like one of those awesome mangas you see that never gets translated.

1057
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,088
Speaker 0: God actually got made into it.

1058
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:41,240
Speaker 1: So this has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1059
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:46,339
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for Web Design and Brando K for the logos.

1069
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:12,070
Speaker 1: So that'll be up on the Patreon as soon as I can get.

1070
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,190
Speaker 1: And then we'll be back on our regular schedule for the foreseeable future.

1071
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:19,170
Speaker 1: The next interruption we'll have will be a very short one for Kineticon.

1072
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:21,802
Speaker 1: Give me another week or two.

1073
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:22,810
Speaker 1: You should start getting emails.

1074
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,510
Speaker 1: Many of you submitted panels to Kineticon if you're actually doing it or whatever.

1075
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:43,694
Speaker 1: But if you think if you sent a panel in and you're one of the people who listens to Geek Nights and you think that it's one that I should have taken and I didn't for whatever reason, email me and remind me because I have very few slots and I'm extremely limited what I can fit.

1076
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:50,749
Speaker 1: But I will definitely take a look at something that someone messaged me about based on listening to what you just listened to.

1077
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,790
Speaker 1: But anyway, I got another special.

1078
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,302
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is resumed.

1079
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:54,890
Speaker 1: Everything's good.

1080
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,970
Speaker 1: I'm almost done with the Wheel of Time and now I leave you with something weird.
