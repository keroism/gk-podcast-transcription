1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,214
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Wednesday January 13th.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,169
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:26,919
Speaker 0: some final thoughts for the great great anime master Keaton Let's do this.

4
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:35,082
Speaker 0: So I discovered the one possibly the only problem of having a very short commute.

5
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:38,150
Speaker 0: What do I do for nine minutes?

6
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:40,634
Speaker 1: Well you can.

7
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:44,827
Speaker 0: I was playing advanced wars every day, but I've asked everything but three.

8
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:45,810
Speaker 0: so I think I listen.

9
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,678
Speaker 1: I have a podcast that is very short.

10
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,530
Speaker 1: You know like the ESPN Sportsy thing.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:58,602
Speaker 1: So if I play if I start playing it when I'm in my house by the time I'm at work It's over you know or by the time I'm sitting at my desk.

12
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,590
Speaker 1: It's pretty much over cuz it's like 20-something minutes.

13
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:02,215
Speaker 0: Yeah I just haven't felt the.

14
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:07,815
Speaker 0: you know go get my headphone thing stick him in the ear after I get on the subway or while I see you do it.

15
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:08,357
Speaker 1: I do it.

16
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:11,490
Speaker 1: I put them in while I'm in the house, and then I walk out the door.

17
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:14,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I put on my headphones, and I put on my coat.

18
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:15,745
Speaker 1: so and then I push play.

19
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:16,186
Speaker 1: so it's.

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,041
Speaker 0: I Considered that but I don't know.

21
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,690
Speaker 0: it is it's tired early morning.

22
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,730
Speaker 0: So I realized the best solution for me right now.

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:36,453
Speaker 0: I just I looked at that gigantic pile of manga that I had but I never saw in the old house because it was just Kind of in boxes out of the way, and I realized I have quite a large collection of slayers manga Reading.

24
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,689
Speaker 0: I'm reading the slayers manga the Lina and Naga slayers manga mm-hmm.

25
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:44,039
Speaker 0: It's pretty great actually now that I'm finally reading it.

26
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,570
Speaker 0: It's basically the same as all the OAVs only in manga form.

27
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,516
Speaker 0: It's really well drawn.

28
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,420
Speaker 0: I don't know I'm digging it.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,297
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna review it or anything just yet, but It's pretty good, and I recommend you read it.

30
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:59,997
Speaker 0: mr.. Likes the Naga episodes more than the TV show, and I almost agree That's right.

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,733
Speaker 0: I don't fully agree That's.

32
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:10,466
Speaker 1: it's interesting that you are going back to something old because I Over the weekend you know there was some cowabeebop on a screen somewhere.

33
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:14,301
Speaker 0: Oh my god I forgot about that and so I was like oh, man.

34
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:24,230
Speaker 1: I'm done watching this here Master Keaton Let me watch something else, and I was gonna get a cowabeebop disc, and I was like you know.

35
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:33,314
Speaker 1: And then I saw you know some other discs in there like the old 60s Astro Boy, and I was like you know It's tough because.

36
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:42,062
Speaker 0: and then I saw my macross discs, and I was like ah Is it bad that we're rewatching things more rapidly than we're watching new things?

37
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:47,178
Speaker 1: doesn't take that long to watch especially since we have more Time in the day even with rewatching.

38
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:51,110
Speaker 1: I am still getting more done than I did with the commute.

39
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,681
Speaker 0: It is difficult though because I'll admit you know we were out for that party in flushing and We're someone in the group hadn't seen cowboy bebop.

40
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:03,803
Speaker 0: so we put it on and it was just there in the background Subtitled even and you know all I thought was all right.

41
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:04,426
Speaker 0: I'll hang out.

42
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,750
Speaker 0: I don't really need to watch this again.

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,606
Speaker 0: I've seen these first five episodes in particular at least 60 or 70 times.

44
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:12,289
Speaker 0: I don't need to see them again.

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:24,890
Speaker 0: I don't think I've seen them quite that many times maybe Six or seven times a lot of times because I'd always bring that one DVD and show it to people all over the place And it'd been many years since I'd seen any cowboy bebop, so it's odd.

46
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:26,557
Speaker 0: I'm like I look at it.

47
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:27,845
Speaker 0: I'm like all right cowboy bebop.

48
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:33,284
Speaker 0: the show is awesome And I ended up watching all five episodes wrapped because the show was.

49
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:41,394
Speaker 0: I don't know the show is great But you kind of always forget just how great it is that even watching it again and again and again It's like Star Wars.

50
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, ah it is like Star Wars like that.

51
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:49,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know I feel like I want to watch all of cowboy bebop again.

52
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:57,786
Speaker 1: I almost rewatched the whole thing back when remember because we bought the brick yep And I almost but I didn't make it all the way through because I started doing something else instead.

53
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,454
Speaker 0: see luckily Emily wants to.

54
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:03,230
Speaker 0: well hasn't seen Ghost in the Shell stand-alone complex, so I'm rewatching that instead.

55
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:07,106
Speaker 0: It's almost on the same level and due to the Natalie haven't seen us Capone, so I'm gonna rewatch.

56
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:07,950
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

57
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the hell remember?

58
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:13,045
Speaker 0: They had not seen utenna until recently.

59
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:14,410
Speaker 0: and these for the listeners.

60
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,642
Speaker 0: These are two people who if utenna was ever up someone's alley.

61
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:19,670
Speaker 0: It is their alley in many ways.

62
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,203
Speaker 1: I think the alley had their name on it when it was made.

63
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:31,848
Speaker 0: It's Yeah, but eska flown a old up old anime not watching new anime not good What new anime gonna watch?

64
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,497
Speaker 0: Me to go and watching is super awesome.

65
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:35,180
Speaker 0: It's not.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,304
Speaker 1: it's not new isn't that?

67
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,630
Speaker 1: like a year old or more alright?

68
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,248
Speaker 0: It's newer than cowboy bebop.

69
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:43,377
Speaker 1: Okay Anything else going on.

70
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,626
Speaker 1: We just get to some news.

71
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,270
Speaker 0: get right into it.

72
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:52,410
Speaker 0: It's been a long time so you'd think we haven't done an anime show since way way way way way back.

73
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:55,530
Speaker 0: I mean we were on hiatus for half of December and we were skipping episodes.

74
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, there must be some anime news in all that time.

75
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,862
Speaker 0: If I had some crickets, I would have played him just then.

76
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:04,870
Speaker 0: good guy anime news network.

77
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:10,818
Speaker 0: It was like wow I might as we might we could skip an entire year And there'd probably be one minor thing to talk about.

78
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:11,520
Speaker 0: maybe and

79
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:25,970
Speaker 1: it's not like this that you know comic book news I mean the comic book news is all like oh this superheroes in trouble This superhero comics being cancelled and this one's starting up and this one right is not really anything of substance going on in that department.

80
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,454
Speaker 1: so What kind of news do we have?

81
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:38,719
Speaker 0: well luckily luckily while there's no anime industry news to speak of really there is always American pseudo meta side industry news.

82
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,709
Speaker 0: and remember way back when katsu khan exploded and all those staffers quit.

83
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:48,610
Speaker 0: and You know Scott and I were staff at katsu khan and we quit just because all the people we knew on the staff disappeared.

84
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:54,089
Speaker 0: The exact same thing pretty much has now happened to anime expo.

85
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,015
Speaker 1: Oh snap anime expo.

86
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,125
Speaker 1: the khan I've never been to I'm pretty sure lied.

87
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,950
Speaker 1: it lied about being the largest anime.

88
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:05,750
Speaker 1: Clearly and we always even though we never went to it got a sense that it wasn't so great.

89
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:14,130
Speaker 0: Well a number of our listeners would go and the reports They'd send back basically came down along the lines of it's really big and corporate and you stand in long lines.

90
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,258
Speaker 0: There's not that much to do.

91
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:23,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, but About 80% of the staff some 400 people according to anime news network have resigned.

92
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,613
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

93
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:28,185
Speaker 0: That's basically as far as I'm concerned the entire convention.

94
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:29,550
Speaker 1: How can you replace those people?

95
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,472
Speaker 0: They can't.

96
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:31,978
Speaker 1: if there's what is the convention?

97
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:33,003
Speaker 0: I don't even know when.

98
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:34,610
Speaker 1: it's sometimes less than a year away.

99
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:42,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot less than a year away, but I Realized something because the dispute came down to much like katsu khan.

100
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:56,081
Speaker 0: There's multiple executive or decision-making bodies and there's basically the convention arm and the kind of company arm and the CEO of Spj a. that has to do with all this.

101
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:57,849
Speaker 0: I don't know if he's a douche.

102
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,361
Speaker 0: I I can't say one way or the other.

103
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:10,667
Speaker 0: based on the text on the internet The words that have come out of his mouth according to the anime news network hints strongly that he may in fact Be a douche.

104
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:24,169
Speaker 1: Let us just say that if a real human being is truthfully associated with the words that are printed on the anime They are digitally printed on the anime news network then that person if they do exist would be King douche.

105
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:25,775
Speaker 0: I'll quote from this article.

106
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:39,863
Speaker 0: other concerns raised by certain ex staff members also included a comment made by let's Lattenzio the CEO at a November 14th meeting in which he compared volunteers to quote flies That must be shooed away if they don't abide by his rule.

107
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,749
Speaker 1: It sounds like a Japanese person for sure.

108
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:50,297
Speaker 0: Part of the dispute had to do with the fact that apparently he flew business class to Japan at The convention or the company's expense.

109
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,810
Speaker 1: Well, it was it for a trip to go do something for the convention?

110
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,579
Speaker 0: I'd assume so.

111
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,509
Speaker 1: So what's wrong with that?

112
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:59,766
Speaker 0: Well, apparently no, no one had ever done that business class for the convention before.

113
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:05,004
Speaker 1: no Mentioned poor I mean if it you know at the conventions got a lot of money.

114
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,410
Speaker 1: You should be going business class.

115
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, he said something really aren't?

116
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,585
Speaker 0: I gotta find it cuz the quote.

117
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:10,630
Speaker 1: that's fucking uncomfortable.

118
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,970
Speaker 0: What he said regarding it was pretty crazy Although the details of his contract regarding travel stipends were not disclosed.

119
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:32,633
Speaker 0: He commented that business class accommodations were among the quote perks listed saying exact quote I don't know how many I don't know how many no CEOs in the business, but there are certain perks Privileges.

120
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,962
Speaker 0: he added that before we plan blah blah blah blah blah.

121
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:35,684
Speaker 0: I don't know.

122
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:36,828
Speaker 0: that sounds real douchey to me.

123
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I guess the way he said it.

124
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:47,890
Speaker 0: but I mean if you're a CEO and there's a lot of money Yes, but you're the CEO of a company that is you're pretending that there's still an anime industry in America.

125
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:53,024
Speaker 1: Well, you know if you guys technically there is yeah, they are it.

126
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:54,570
Speaker 1: they make all this money from this convention.

127
00:08:55,271 --> 00:09:07,684
Speaker 0: See, that's the thing the conventions really have to realize that the way to make money off of anime in America right now is not To actually do anything with the anime But to deal with the meta industry the fans the punk kids who want to hang out.

128
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,410
Speaker 0: maybe the schlocky merch.

129
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:13,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing about volunteers though is a pretty bad.

130
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,830
Speaker 0: Well, I realized look at this katsu khan and anime Expo at the same problem.

131
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:29,160
Speaker 0: There was a dispute at the high level right and then a couple wondered like a small number of high-level Staffers said you know what fuck this and quit and as a result Everyone under them also quit.

132
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,866
Speaker 0: and I think it's a I'm gonna.

133
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,010
Speaker 0: I'm gonna pull a classic rim.

134
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,758
Speaker 0: It's an ancient Rome situation.

135
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,250
Speaker 0: The soldiers were all not loyal to the convention.

136
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:41,465
Speaker 0: They were loyal to the idea of conventions particularly staffing them and they were loyal to their generals.

137
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,070
Speaker 0: They weren't loyal to the Empire.

138
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,154
Speaker 1: That's right.

139
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:48,930
Speaker 1: You see the problem is is that you know, people don't really think about organizational structure.

140
00:09:49,231 --> 00:10:02,546
Speaker 1: They sort of defaultly fall into a hierarchy not because the hierarchy is some sort of natural thing But because you know just that's like, you know If you don't think people just make hierarchies because that's what our society teaches you to make.

141
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:06,060
Speaker 1: it's always about, you know Who's in charge, you know, we live in a democratic society.

142
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,894
Speaker 1: There's a hierarchy from president on down, you know It's a federal structure.

143
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,783
Speaker 1: People are used to federal structure most things.

144
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,453
Speaker 1: most organizations have a federal Hierarchical structure.

145
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:25,358
Speaker 1: thus that's the kind of structure people make without even if they don't actually put in the extra effort to actually think about Doing some other sort of structure.

146
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:28,350
Speaker 1: and therefore when you have this hierarchy, right?

147
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:36,030
Speaker 1: like an anime convention you get some sort of board of generals at the top and Everyone else sort of falls off in branches from the side.

148
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,690
Speaker 1: Well, and the result is is that the branches don't mesh very well.

149
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,095
Speaker 0: Also think about the kinds of people who staff anime conventions as opposed to other, you know Generally the fan conventions.

150
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:54,090
Speaker 0: really they're mostly people who do it because they love doing it Like they enjoy being staff kind of like how there's the artist alley people or the like the gaming room people.

151
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:56,490
Speaker 0: These are the people who basically they're con experience.

152
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:04,690
Speaker 0: What they enjoy is being staff being like the overworked guy who puts in like 20 40 hours of work And they're all for like all their friends do the convention.

153
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:10,010
Speaker 0: Would you do all that work if your friends weren't gonna be at the convention staffing with you?

154
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:17,874
Speaker 0: Mmm, it's real easy to have this situation where if a few people quit a staff of a big anime con suddenly Everyone starts quitting.

155
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:19,298
Speaker 0: It's like a snowball.

156
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:22,850
Speaker 0: that only happens if people aren't actually loyal to the convention itself.

157
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,587
Speaker 0: There's loyal to their friends the idea of conventions to all that and it's really endemic.

158
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:31,263
Speaker 0: and anime cons I think because most anime cons treat their staff like shit.

159
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,790
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna try to sugarcoat it.

160
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,590
Speaker 0: They treat their staff like garbage and it's so hard to become staff at a lot of these larger conventions.

161
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,370
Speaker 0: I mean you have to like oh well be a gopher first.

162
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:48,490
Speaker 0: And if you're okay, if you can go for really really well for like three years We'll let you be the guy in the staff who sent hands out badges on Thursday.

163
00:11:49,092 --> 00:12:06,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not only do they treat the staff poorly but like they really don't appreciate the staff, you know It's and the staff right will always complain that they're underappreciated like oh I do all this hard work and nobody cares Right, but meanwhile at PAX they're like, oh,

164
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,270
Speaker 0: that was the first thing they said at closing ceremonies.

165
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:13,847
Speaker 0: We couldn't have done this without all of you who took it upon yourselves to take up the black for us.

166
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 0: Yeah And then remember back Otakon after the The interesting comments about volunteers in the feedback session.

167
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,160
Speaker 0: and then Aaron Clark said quoting exactly from his post in the forum Gophering is not supposed to be fun.

168
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,728
Speaker 0: You're put where you're put if you don't like it.

169
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:30,230
Speaker 0: Don't do it.

170
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,033
Speaker 0: It's as simple as that.

171
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,704
Speaker 0: if working in the same department all weekend is undesirable to you.

172
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:35,330
Speaker 0: I wouldn't recommend becoming a staffer.

173
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why you're short on staff because you're telling people not to now.

174
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:43,850
Speaker 0: he recanted that statement later, but It tells that it was even said in the first place.

175
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,410
Speaker 0: I mean look at I hate to keep using packs as the example But look at packs because it's the only convention we've been to this doing it, right?

176
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,560
Speaker 1: What effect you where else that we've gone has done it right.

177
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,470
Speaker 1: every other every other place Right other than packs that we've been to at least right?

178
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:00,079
Speaker 0: One exception the New York Anime Festival did that.

179
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,603
Speaker 0: they tried as right they could.

180
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:05,182
Speaker 0: they called them heroes and the heroes all looked Like they were having fun.

181
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:16,290
Speaker 1: Yeah But no, but you know every other place is either, you know, they treat them like poop and they're volunteers or say like You know to baseball stadium, they're all employees.

182
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:21,590
Speaker 1: You know all the vendors that walk around selling cotton candy get paid so they don't need to be treated.

183
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,907
Speaker 1: Well, cuz they get money.

184
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,873
Speaker 0: So We'll see what happens.

185
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:30,910
Speaker 0: I predict that this convention Anime Expo this year is going to be an enormous cluster.

186
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,728
Speaker 1: I don't think it'll happen.

187
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:35,387
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna happen and I think it's gonna be a disaster and that might be the end of it.

188
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:44,061
Speaker 0: Maybe Meanwhile, we have it on good authority that katsu khan which you know had all of these similar troubles a while ago And then basically it's been radio silence.

189
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,470
Speaker 0: since then they've ignored.

190
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,225
Speaker 0: I've emailed everyone that I used to know and all the email addresses.

191
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,050
Speaker 0: No one's responded.

192
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,262
Speaker 1: But someone probably none of them work there anymore.

193
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:59,390
Speaker 0: someone as yet well I guess to be unnamed told us that basically they don't have a schedule yet.

194
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:01,536
Speaker 1: Isn't the con in February?

195
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, isn't it January?

196
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:07,719
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I mean we're panel staff for kinetic on.

197
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:09,885
Speaker 0: we've already started scheduling panels.

198
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,581
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's in August.

199
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,995
Speaker 0: yeah So we'll see.

200
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:18,350
Speaker 0: I predict that katsu khan is going to be an equally big clusterfuck.

201
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:19,069
Speaker 0: I may be wrong.

202
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:20,624
Speaker 0: I can't say I'm not staff.

203
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:26,353
Speaker 0: if Anyone on the katsu khan staff would like to tell us what's up or tell us the cons gonna be awesome I'd love to hear it.

204
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:26,915
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

205
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:29,464
Speaker 0: So Scott, do you have any undepressing anime news?

206
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:30,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

207
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:36,729
Speaker 1: So You know Tezuka the god the most amazing almighty Tezuka, right.

208
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:47,008
Speaker 1: Even more amazing the fact that he made hundreds of thousands of pages of manga and also made animes You know many of which are revolutionary made animes made anime.

209
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,923
Speaker 1: Yeah And did all these other things right.

210
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:56,801
Speaker 1: he also Traveled the world and had friends all over the world.

211
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,390
Speaker 1: It's like how the fuck did he do all these things in one life?

212
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:00,633
Speaker 1: I don't know.

213
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:01,076
Speaker 1: He cheated.

214
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:04,014
Speaker 1: I Guess he didn't sleep right?

215
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:04,556
Speaker 1: is X?

216
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:05,942
Speaker 1: that was always the joke.

217
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:09,918
Speaker 1: is the him people who work for Tezuka didn't sleep And there were actually two Tezuka's.

218
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,866
Speaker 0: it's kind of like Gallagher and fake Gallagher.

219
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:12,810
Speaker 0: You don't know which one you're getting.

220
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

221
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:15,746
Speaker 0: He probably had a twin brother who couldn't draw.

222
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:25,070
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway Basically, you know Tezuka had friends all over the world like Fred Schott and such right in the u.s.

223
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,391
Speaker 1: Here.

224
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:31,318
Speaker 1: he also had a friend in Brazil someone named who I didn't know about ever but I am now very interested in.

225
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:43,781
Speaker 1: his name was Mauricio de Sousa and he is a Brazilian with a Japanese wife and he is pretty much like the Disney of Brazil and He made lots of awesome comics in Brazil.

226
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:46,290
Speaker 1: I think he's been doing it for what does it say here?

227
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:52,150
Speaker 1: 50 years and his works appear in over half of the comic magazines published in Brazil.

228
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:55,059
Speaker 1: So that's a pretty amazing person right there.

229
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,670
Speaker 1: I definitely have to go check out his comics find if any are in English and such.

230
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:02,890
Speaker 1: But anyway, he was friends with Tezuka very good friends with him.

231
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:19,473
Speaker 1: they often you know met when they were traveling and such and It says here on the a9 news network that they were going to create an adventure movie about world peace With astro boy and princess knight characters alongside DeSouza's characters.

232
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:25,810
Speaker 0: that sounds a lot like what happened with giant robo basically if you think about it, so they drafted these plans.

233
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:33,278
Speaker 1: By then Tezuka died because while being omnipotent and omniscient He is your news that this is gonna come to fruition.

234
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:33,860
Speaker 0: It was not.

235
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:41,450
Speaker 1: it was not immortal, but now DeSouza says at long last I am filling I am fulfilling our promise.

236
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:46,646
Speaker 1: So he's going to make this happen even though it didn't happen before.

237
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,990
Speaker 1: it's gonna happen now.

238
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,562
Speaker 0: I'm excited about that now.

239
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:50,630
Speaker 1: I'm gonna check it out for sure.

240
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:52,739
Speaker 1: See yeah, he went to.

241
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,418
Speaker 1: he met up with Tezuka productions And he was like can we make this happen?

242
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,370
Speaker 1: and they're like all right you were friends at Tezuka.

243
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,771
Speaker 1: So yes, we can make this happen.

244
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,498
Speaker 0: so things of the day.

245
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:11,859
Speaker 0: This is not a Wikipedia page.

246
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,776
Speaker 0: it is a user's Wikipedia page, so take that as you will.

247
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,525
Speaker 0: but I Like this sort of thing.

248
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,398
Speaker 0: it is a list of cats with fraudulent diplomas.

249
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:30,867
Speaker 1: Another thing that's interesting about a list of fraudulent diplomas is if you look at the names of the schools Right and you see what those you know especially.

250
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:35,920
Speaker 1: you know there are some generic schools like you know something Walla Walla University.

251
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:48,851
Speaker 1: Well that could be a diploma in fucking anything right, but if there's a specific one like the British Board of Neurolinguistic Programs Yes, see when you see the name of a school like that And then you find out that that school is giving illegitimate diplomas.

252
00:17:48,911 --> 00:18:02,430
Speaker 1: you can use these things to figure out which Professions are illegitimate because the places that give out diplomas for those professions are illegitimate and there aren't really any Legitimate places giving out diplomas in that department.

253
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:09,504
Speaker 0: speaking of which if anyone would like a degree from RIT The RIM Institute of Technology for five dollars I will make this possible.

254
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:18,249
Speaker 0: if anyone would like a degree from You you were gonna make a joke and you just failed there.

255
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:19,313
Speaker 1: you got nothing.

256
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,180
Speaker 1: there was no place that had an S in it.

257
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,700
Speaker 0: How about the United Fellowship of Hypnotherapists or the Professional Hypnotherapy Practitioner Association?

258
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,683
Speaker 1: Hypnotherapy is BS.

259
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:28,226
Speaker 1: That's Randy.

260
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:28,849
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

261
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,920
Speaker 0: yeah, so is neurolinguistic programming?

262
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:32,631
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much the same as hypnotism.

263
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,000
Speaker 0: the cat's names are pretty good, too.

264
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,089
Speaker 0: Henrietta Goldacre was one of the cats.

265
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:41,293
Speaker 0: Tobias F. Schaeffer F stands for feline Mmm, my favorite is Kitty O'Malley.

266
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:42,519
Speaker 1: that could be a real name.

267
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,034
Speaker 0: good But apparently Kitty got a high school diploma from Washington High Academy.

268
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:48,680
Speaker 1: Oh, it sounds like a real high school.

269
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,928
Speaker 0: But so did a cat.

270
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,759
Speaker 0: it's known only as Spanky.

271
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,356
Speaker 1: That's definitely just a cat name.

272
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:57,853
Speaker 0: This seems to be a pretty good way to go.

273
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,889
Speaker 1: after these I had I think I'm actually gonna go see.

274
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:03,580
Speaker 1: this question is right these mail-order diplomas.

275
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,306
Speaker 0: What if you get them not for fun?

276
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,233
Speaker 1: And well, how much do they cost?

277
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:08,900
Speaker 1: are these places making big bank?

278
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,802
Speaker 1: I don't know.

279
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,693
Speaker 1: cuz if it's cheap, I'll get.

280
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,458
Speaker 1: I'll be dr.

281
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:12,760
Speaker 1: Scott.

282
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:13,725
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

283
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,776
Speaker 1: if it's fake I get as long as I can call myself.

284
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:21,140
Speaker 0: All right, here's a quote Colby Nolan who is a house cat who got an MBA from Trinity Southern.

285
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,083
Speaker 1: I need one of those.

286
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:25,412
Speaker 0: Colby Nolan belonged to a deputy deputy attorney general.

287
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:36,042
Speaker 0: in looking to expose Trinity Southern University for fraud Some undercover agents had the then six-year-old Colby Nolan obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration for $299.

288
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:36,926
Speaker 1: That's too much money.

289
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:38,714
Speaker 0: on the cat's application.

290
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:39,256
Speaker 1: Let's start a fake.

291
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,091
Speaker 1: Everyone will pay us $300 for paper.

292
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,628
Speaker 0: Let me finish on the cat's application.

293
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:53,667
Speaker 0: the agents claimed that the cat had previously taken courses at a community college worked at a fast-food restaurant Babysat and maintained a newspaper route.

294
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:58,283
Speaker 0: the school then informed Colby that due to his job experience On the application.

295
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:01,453
Speaker 0: He was eligible for an executive MBA for only $100 more.

296
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:07,785
Speaker 0: No The Ted got a 3.5 GPA Uh-huh.

297
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,939
Speaker 1: So who actually did it accent to do any courses?

298
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,804
Speaker 1: Correspondence courses or anything.

299
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,633
Speaker 0: I don't think so, but it's $300.

300
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,900
Speaker 1: Why don't we set up a fake phony University?

301
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,043
Speaker 0: Why even make it fake?

302
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:21,492
Speaker 0: just make a real University that's not accredited and just not claim.

303
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,194
Speaker 0: We're accredited.

304
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,317
Speaker 0: It's not even fraud.

305
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:25,763
Speaker 1: Oh Let's do it.

306
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:26,848
Speaker 0: It's not fraud at all.

307
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,536
Speaker 0: I can sell plumbers 50 bucks.

308
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:29,320
Speaker 0: I can sell you.

309
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:30,866
Speaker 1: I'll go to staples.

310
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,552
Speaker 1: I'll buy a stack of diploma paper.

311
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,460
Speaker 1: That's that cost less than 50 bucks.

312
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:36,725
Speaker 1: So as long as we get one customer we're set I'll.

313
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:42,740
Speaker 1: even if we make enough money I can use it by a color laser printer and then get someone to design a really nice diploma.

314
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,469
Speaker 0: You can even make a test just an are you awesome test?

315
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:55,964
Speaker 1: and if you pass it for some and we actually won't give it The people to people who fail we give you a diploma, but we still charge you an application fee, of course Let's do it.

316
00:20:56,165 --> 00:21:03,275
Speaker 1: We should and then we can use all the monies for something awesome That is legitimate and good to make up for the fact that we're scamming all these morons.

317
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:04,279
Speaker 0: So what do you got for me?

318
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,560
Speaker 1: Oh, so I was reminded recently of this comic book that I thought I had but I must have given it away.

319
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:17,243
Speaker 1: I only bought the first issue and then I guess I don't have the first issue anymore and I never got any other issues because I was waiting for the trade.

320
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:18,427
Speaker 1: that never ever appeared.

321
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:25,832
Speaker 1: but the comic I believe we talked about in the show a long time ago Remember it was called I was kidnapped by lesbian pirates from outer space.

322
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:30,832
Speaker 0: I really liked that comic Yeah, but so I was like, huh?

323
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,560
Speaker 1: Why did the trade paperback never come out?

324
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,140
Speaker 1: So I searched on the Google and it's a webcomic.

325
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,088
Speaker 1: So you can read it for free which I'm gonna do.

326
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:43,460
Speaker 1: and I actually have another webcomic a double webcomic thing of the day.

329
00:21:54,532 --> 00:22:00,785
Speaker 1: you know, this comic is basically gag strips, but Interspersed throughout the gag strips.

330
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:07,000
Speaker 1: There is so far three parts right of an anime club saga.

331
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:11,840
Speaker 0: Is it on the same scale as my hope sky ties anime club saga?

339
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:53,958
Speaker 1: So and each part is multiple strips, you know, so and I don't think it's over yet I think part four is coming but there are gag strips in the meantime.

340
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,585
Speaker 1: So And also the gag strips are funny.

Speaker 0: Yep So tonight we're gonna talk about an anime that I watched all the way through quite some time ago.

347
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:11,880
Speaker 0: Scott recently watched all the way through it.

348
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,239
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we reviewed it back in the day.

349
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:18,617
Speaker 0: We'll spoil but we're gonna hold off on the spoilers for a bit.

350
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,958
Speaker 0: if you're interested I recommend you check out that original review.

351
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:24,872
Speaker 0: But master Keaton is a the master.

352
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:35,658
Speaker 0: It is so such an underrated underknown under appreciated Anime and manga series that is by someone you may know you may know him.

353
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:43,500
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean everybody in the whole world is going crazy over the Pluto's and the monster and 20th century boys.

354
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,180
Speaker 1: Right, but nobody at least outside of Japan is giving any appreciation to nayoka.

355
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,323
Speaker 1: Ira saw was older stuff like, you know fashionable judo girl Yara and Master Keaton.

356
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,168
Speaker 1: master Keaton is a master.

357
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,777
Speaker 1: Keaton was on sale on DVD from genie on.

358
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:01,880
Speaker 1: that's how old this show.

359
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:02,805
Speaker 1: That's how long ago.

360
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:05,860
Speaker 1: the show was released in the US and basically nobody bought it.

361
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,994
Speaker 1: It did terribly in fact the show us.

362
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:14,196
Speaker 0: the show was on TV More than ten years ago in the United States or in Japan in Japan.

363
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was ever on I don't think it was ever on TV in the US.

364
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:25,794
Speaker 1: It was only on DVD in the US which is how we watched it because I bought all of the discs for like five bucks Each at a discount an ultra discount guy like three or four Otakons ago.

365
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,139
Speaker 0: Was it Otakon or was it?

366
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:32,200
Speaker 1: Otakon they had the $5 place but that $5 guy was also at anime next.

367
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,759
Speaker 0: Ah, because I think there's where I bought a whole bunch of stuff.

368
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we definitely bought the master Keaton at Otakon.

369
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,980
Speaker 1: I think it was the same year They had like the $20 Zeta Gundam box.

370
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:49,604
Speaker 0: If you want to see an urasawa that isn't just suspense building to some crazy client X denying Oh, wow, you're right.

371
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:50,446
Speaker 0: step of the way.

372
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,011
Speaker 0: This is the opposite of that.

373
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,335
Speaker 0: It is a slice of life.

374
00:24:53,717 --> 00:24:56,345
Speaker 0: Let's follow this guy Completely episodic.

375
00:24:56,746 --> 00:25:05,680
Speaker 0: I mean there's tension and cliffhangers, but every episode resolves itself and It's a very very different feel from any of his more recent works.

376
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,030
Speaker 0: It's basically the story of master Keaton.

377
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:11,694
Speaker 0: Hi, itchy Keaton.

378
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:12,517
Speaker 0: He's just this guy.

379
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:13,399
Speaker 0: He was in the SAS.

380
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:14,904
Speaker 0: He's a professor now.

381
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:19,720
Speaker 0: He's kind of half Inspector Gadget half Indiana Jones with a little bit of MacGyver.

382
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:21,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's.

383
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:29,360
Speaker 1: it's really strange this character It's like because he's such a. he's a good person and he's a happy guy and he's really friendly.

384
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:36,146
Speaker 1: He's a little derp-de-derp and he's a little bit derp-de-derp, but in a way back way But he's.

385
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:39,137
Speaker 1: he's actually like an ultimate badass.

386
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:39,760
Speaker 0: You know what he is?

387
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:43,511
Speaker 0: He is the hachi fucking Roku in human form.

388
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:44,374
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

389
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:45,277
Speaker 0: He's the sleeper.

390
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,220
Speaker 0: No one everyone looks him.

391
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,039
Speaker 0: They're like that guy's not a threat to me.

392
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:55,374
Speaker 0: There's no way that can be my GTR and then he just beat you in the corners exactly And you know, it's pretty crazy cuz it's like.

393
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:55,998
Speaker 1: he was in the SAS.

394
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,818
Speaker 1: he was an instructor of the survival school right the ultimate badass.

395
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,793
Speaker 1: and Now he's just sort of like doo doo doo doo doo.

396
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:17,180
Speaker 1: teach in archaeology La la la la la and then you know, basically something happens and he ends up, you know Not being able to teach archaeology like he wants to and he has to take a job being an insurance inspector for Lloyd's of London.

397
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:31,539
Speaker 1: So, you know, he's doing all sorts of interesting insurance Inspections which are you know insurance inspecting is very detectivey work, but it's not and it is dangerous But not nearly in the way that it is portrayed in the show.

398
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,148
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is look at who master Keaton is.

399
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:40,820
Speaker 0: everyone who works with him knows how much of a badass he is But no one else does they send him on what are effectively?

400
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Speaker 0: Incredibly dangerous and shady mission which wouldn't really exist.

401
00:26:44,700 --> 00:27:00,208
Speaker 1: I mean, would you really ever have to send an insurance inspector to find out like, you know If the Russian KGB terrorist guy is like you're gonna steal something that's expensive or something like, you know It's yeah, I think it was like episode two right away.

402
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:02,816
Speaker 0: It's bounty hunters and the German Red Army.

403
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like, you know.

404
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,798
Speaker 1: But is he really gonna have to go and find like some guy who's hiding out and you know from the police in?

405
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,169
Speaker 1: Order to like deliver him an insurance payment.

406
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:19,460
Speaker 1: He's supposed to receive from you know, someone who died.

407
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:21,106
Speaker 0: What's fun about watching the show though?

408
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:24,900
Speaker 0: Is that it's kind of this like when we watch the old Horatio hornblower series?

409
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:29,219
Speaker 0: There's a certain flow to every episode and you wait for the Duke Togo.

410
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:33,060
Speaker 0: moment We're Duke Togo has sex with the girl punches in the face shoots or shoot someone else and leaves.

411
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:43,238
Speaker 0: Now you wait for it and master Keaton the moment is How much did the bad guy underestimate him by and when is he going to find out that he underestimated master Keaton?

412
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,760
Speaker 1: I know I get you know.

413
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,082
Speaker 1: I think the episodic ness of it is what I like the most because you know so much Erissot.

414
00:27:51,242 --> 00:28:01,820
Speaker 1: usually when you get your Urasawa you just had to read like a whole shit ton of manga volumes in a row and he's Like got you by the balls and he doesn't give you anything and you're just in constant suspense the whole time.

415
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,133
Speaker 1: But in this, you know, basically there isn't that much suspense.

416
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:06,760
Speaker 1: You just watch these stories.

417
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:13,600
Speaker 1: They don't have a lot to do with each other You know you get a little bit of continuity because you learn basically more about master Keaton and his history.

418
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,791
Speaker 1: And it's you know, his family.

419
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:25,160
Speaker 1: you never see his ex-wife though But like you see his daughter calling her on the phone and stuff You know and his father and his business partner and you learn all these, you know.

420
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,880
Speaker 1: You basically get a bigger picture of him and the things that surround him, but there isn't like a plot there.

421
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,672
Speaker 1: It's like oh is he ever gonna get back together with his wife?

422
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,038
Speaker 1: But that's it's not a plot.

423
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,180
Speaker 0: in a way It's kind of like cowboy bebop that there is this world and there are these characters.

424
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,920
Speaker 0: But the world plot is not the plot of the show or of the character effectively.

425
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:49,058
Speaker 0: Yeah The character is just there in this world doing what people do.

426
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:54,536
Speaker 0: So which in this case involves making odd laddles and totally kicking people's asses with them.

427
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:59,903
Speaker 0: Yeah But episodic wise it's Maybe a couple.

428
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:00,710
Speaker 0: you've off had the same thing.

429
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:07,740
Speaker 0: when I think about it master Keaton The episodes despite having the same kind of flow are very very different from each other.

430
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,144
Speaker 0: I mean some episodes.

431
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:10,007
Speaker 0: Keaton's hardly in him.

432
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:16,710
Speaker 0: It's just his daughter going around having an adventure or the grandpa going around having an adventure Yep, and everyone it's like.

433
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,260
Speaker 1: the kinds of adventures are so diverse.

434
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:28,660
Speaker 1: It's like basically what they're doing is they're writing all these separate stories That master Keaton just happens to be and all of them and they I mean they range as a way to tie them together.

435
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:36,680
Speaker 1: Right, if they just put these separate stories up it would be like, okay They range from hilarious tiger cages to dead serious people dying.

436
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:53,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the level of seriousness does vary quite a bit but not even within the same episode like the same episode will like have like hilarious jokes of like, you know, really silly drunk dudes and also horrible murdering and Evilness.

437
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:55,420
Speaker 0: the humor though is often very understated.

438
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,964
Speaker 0: It's very master key.

439
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:03,380
Speaker 0: like Keaton will say something clever or say something wrong or notice something weird or someone just does something weird.

440
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:09,267
Speaker 1: Mmm, also a lot of the things he does Are sort of MacGyver-y unrealistic.

441
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:14,400
Speaker 1: I would argue that like they're all you know, there's there's a lot of things that are based in reality.

442
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:27,612
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like supernatural But it's basically like, you know, yes, you could you know do that, but you know in all seriousness that would not really be enough.

443
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:33,675
Speaker 0: I would say I've read a lot of Writings to the effect that many of the things he does are patently realistic like I know.

444
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:35,240
Speaker 1: I'm saying they are real things.

445
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,005
Speaker 1: You did those things.

446
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,154
Speaker 1: you would not, you know, you would not be the ultimate badass.

447
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:45,975
Speaker 0: the thing he did with the dog We'll get to the spoiler line a little bit is pretty much exactly by the book.

448
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:47,360
Speaker 0: what you do in that situation.

449
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:48,629
Speaker 1: It is an example.

450
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:55,680
Speaker 1: right like when he was When he was with the painter who you know was being forced to paint the forgery.

451
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:01,120
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, he took like a light bulb and some other stuff and he made like a friggin grenade.

452
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:02,689
Speaker 1: It's like you can do that.

453
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:09,860
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you could do that But if you did would it really happen exactly that way and you would get away and the bad guy would be set on fire?

454
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,484
Speaker 1: Well, probably not.

455
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:20,950
Speaker 0: actually the flat replacing the light bulb like an incandescent bulb in a room with one That's rigged to explode is an old fairly common booby-traff.

456
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:25,422
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying it would explode but you would not be so fortuitous That would.

457
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:30,123
Speaker 1: it would explode in such a way that you would escape without being horribly burned and only the bad guy would be Burned.

458
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:30,729
Speaker 1: it depends.

459
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,679
Speaker 0: It would be more of a flash.

460
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:34,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it just you know the.

461
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:38,878
Speaker 1: the truth of that that mechanism is a real mechanism is correct.

462
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:48,599
Speaker 1: the the the actual Occurrence and you know execution of that mechanism is not a hundred percent in line with realism.

463
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,348
Speaker 1: master Keaton would be long dead if this was real.

464
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:57,318
Speaker 0: nine some of the episodes but by the same token in many of them like the Out-lottle, that's probably how it would have gone down.

465
00:31:58,002 --> 00:32:01,820
Speaker 0: Maybe pistols aren't that accurate especially in wind like that against a moving target?

466
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:03,004
Speaker 1: No, no, but I mean it was.

467
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:09,613
Speaker 1: he really gonna be able to knock down that frickin arch, you know with the with the out-lottle You know, I mean he did.

468
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,380
Speaker 1: they did foreshadow.

469
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:13,626
Speaker 1: He was like, yeah This keystone is loose But well, I mean a rock.

470
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:19,255
Speaker 0: a little rock at it even with an out-lottle is not possibly what I would argue There is that there are two factors going on.

471
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:34,820
Speaker 0: There's the realistic thing that is done but then there is the fact that Keaton always ends up in a situation where there is the fortuitous luck that Augments the situation that pushes him beyond just a normal person and new kind of this legendary status kind of like Duke Togo.

472
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,051
Speaker 0: Dude, you couldn't really shoot people the way Duke Togo shoots people.

473
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:40,600
Speaker 0: but part is nothing supernatural about it.

474
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,780
Speaker 0: But at the same time the odds are the odds are low that Duke Togo could make all of those shots.

475
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:49,680
Speaker 0: He could have made one of them fortuitously.

476
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:57,440
Speaker 0: But the point of this master Keaton kind of makes a Duke Togo shot Every episode and any one of them would have been plausible all of them not plausible.

477
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:01,032
Speaker 1: Maybe that's what's like awesome about these kind of things right?

478
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:03,540
Speaker 1: even initial D has that where there's nothing supernatural, right?

479
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,488
Speaker 1: It's not magic.

480
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:06,402
Speaker 1: No one's using magic Nobody's.

481
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:16,674
Speaker 1: there's no, you know spirits or gods or spells or there isn't even any technology That's futuristic or science fiction like time machines or laser guns or anything like that, right?

482
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:18,420
Speaker 1: It's all real stuff.

483
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:22,115
Speaker 1: I mean this doesn't even take place in the in this, you know century, right?

484
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:25,287
Speaker 1: doesn't this take place in like You know the 80s or even older.

485
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,657
Speaker 0: It's well, yeah, I think it's the 80s 90s.

486
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:28,440
Speaker 0: That's what it feels like.

487
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

488
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,495
Speaker 1: so this is yeah, cuz definitely during the Cold War.

489
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:35,971
Speaker 1: So I think it's 80s ish Or maybe you know, it's just after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

490
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:36,654
Speaker 1: Ah, you're right.

491
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,160
Speaker 1: You're right cuz that's part of the story.

492
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,424
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's it's.

493
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:43,095
Speaker 1: it's 90s early 90s ish not counting obviously flashbacks.

494
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:50,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, so You know, it's fairly modern times but it's and nothing is supernatural.

495
00:33:51,016 --> 00:34:09,033
Speaker 1: but even so the the the amount of the luck factor is Makes it seem supernatural because these things go his way Every single time, you know, even though he does, you know, they'll make him take some damage Like you make James Bond take some damage, you know Cuz he can't.

496
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:09,196
Speaker 1: just.

497
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:13,887
Speaker 1: you know It'll look stupid if he walks out of there like completely shiny Even though they're all these bad guys.

498
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,938
Speaker 0: you Duke Togo gets cut written up.

499
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:25,940
Speaker 0: Oh My god, we were at the comic shop in the city and they have one of those awesome figures, but it's Duke Togo.

500
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,898
Speaker 0: You know those have like interchangeable facial expressions and all this stuff.

501
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:32,520
Speaker 0: Duke Togo has two facial expressions.

502
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:41,629
Speaker 0: One of them is him with no facial expression and the other one has such a subtle Sneer that you might not even realize its difference.

503
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:45,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also comes to the speech bubble with ellipses dot-dot-dot.

504
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:52,902
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so before we spoil, you know, this is the final thoughts episode We're not gonna talk about.

505
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:53,485
Speaker 1: really I didn't.

506
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:55,493
Speaker 0: master Keaton again, cuz we've reviewed this before.

507
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:59,065
Speaker 0: we're just kind of talking about it again Both of us having seen the whole show.

508
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:07,698
Speaker 0: if you have not seen master Keaton just go and get the first episode I don't care how and just watch it and watch the opener.

509
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,608
Speaker 0: because well I just want to say the opener to the show.

510
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:10,956
Speaker 0: I really like it.

511
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:12,442
Speaker 0: It's okay It's just.

512
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:17,979
Speaker 0: it has the appropriate level of kind of slice of life mixed with this epic feeling.

513
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:19,385
Speaker 0: Yes, good.

514
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:20,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it.

515
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,051
Speaker 1: It's okay.

516
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:21,874
Speaker 1: It's a good opener.

517
00:35:21,895 --> 00:35:25,186
Speaker 1: It's not like oh my gosh Opener for all time.

518
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:26,550
Speaker 0: I watched it every episode.

519
00:35:27,032 --> 00:35:30,543
Speaker 1: I only watched it sometimes I mostly skipped over it Able to finish it.

520
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,910
Speaker 0: so quick just watch the first episode.

521
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:35,940
Speaker 0: you will know after the first episode if you like master Keaton or not.

522
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,814
Speaker 0: If you don't like that first episode, you'll hate master Keaton.

523
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:40,140
Speaker 0: Every episode is like that.

524
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is that you really like.

525
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:43,231
Speaker 1: I was kind of.

526
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:45,720
Speaker 1: you know, there is that slight connection between the episodes.

527
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:53,693
Speaker 1: So I didn't want to skip around, you know, cuz I'd might miss something but really You can skip around to any episode except there's a two-parter.

528
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:55,680
Speaker 1: the last two episodes are a two-part.

529
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,970
Speaker 1: You have to watch those in order but every other episode in the whole show You can just watch it in any freaking order.

530
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:02,659
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter at all.

531
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:06,188
Speaker 1: So you can just ignore episode numbers entirely.

532
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:09,115
Speaker 1: There's really no continuity to speak of.

533
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,240
Speaker 0: also don't really marathon it.

534
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,827
Speaker 0: It's the kind of show where you're better off.

535
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:15,680
Speaker 0: Just whenever you feel like it watch the next episode.

536
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:18,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, and to do not, you know, it's okay to skip around.

537
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:19,680
Speaker 0: Don't fall into this trap.

538
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:27,827
Speaker 0: If you look at what the next episode is from the preview or the title and think I probably won't like that episode And try to skip to one with a good title.

539
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:29,172
Speaker 0: Don't be fooled.

540
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:31,360
Speaker 0: Don't you're gonna miss some good episodes.

541
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, every episode is pretty much of the same caliber.

542
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:40,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much I mean, there's some episodes that sort of stand out as like better than the others.

543
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:46,615
Speaker 1: a little bit, you know, there's like the Like the one where he's got the annoying old lady on the train.

544
00:36:46,635 --> 00:36:47,800
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good one.

545
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:51,803
Speaker 0: It was okay, but the one with the other bombs in the mall I really like.

546
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,750
Speaker 1: but I like the ones with like.

547
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,617
Speaker 1: was it Charlie the other detective.

548
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:56,500
Speaker 1: Those are real good.

549
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,913
Speaker 1: I love Charlie's like double.

550
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:58,599
Speaker 1: good, you know.

551
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:03,740
Speaker 0: Oh, there's the one where the Mafia takes over the hotel and he's there with that old military guy.

552
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:08,006
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the hotel that's on the island and yeah I need the boat and the punk kids like.

553
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,035
Speaker 0: I got this but the punk kid was stupid.

554
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:11,040
Speaker 1: The punk kid was stupid.

555
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:12,946
Speaker 0: That was such a great episode.

556
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:17,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the old man the drunk old man was the secret badass, but you knew that all along.

557
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,598
Speaker 1: Yeah The only thing about that ever said I didn't like was like.

558
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:25,600
Speaker 1: Even though he was the old man who was secretly badass He kept grabbing that girl's ass and then she actually liked him eventually.

559
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:30,414
Speaker 1: But if I tried that it totally would not work.

560
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,540
Speaker 0: Oh the wine.

561
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:37,220
Speaker 0: The wine episode was great only because of also the ghost in the shell wine episode.

562
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they might have stolen it from me.

563
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:40,179
Speaker 1: I don't know.

564
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,326
Speaker 0: Yeah But I think that's just us cuz.

565
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,553
Speaker 0: Emily pointed this out for some reason.

566
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:49,594
Speaker 0: like ghost in the shell as an aside has fan service on multiple levels.

567
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:58,192
Speaker 0: if you're into like Futurism like pop sci philosophy the side, you know science fiction kind of stuff Ghost in the shell is just fan service for you.

568
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:09,637
Speaker 0: if you're into butts Ghost in the shell has fan service for you in the form of the major If you're like me and Scott the fan service for you in that show is actually Aramaki.

569
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:12,309
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I don't know why but it's just us.

570
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:12,972
Speaker 0: I mean look at him.

571
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:14,500
Speaker 0: He's a badass guy.

572
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:22,380
Speaker 0: Togusa gives some good But Aramaki always does the immediate Astro boy thing in every situation.

573
00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:29,930
Speaker 0: That's right And he's Astro boy and the only time he doesn't is when he has a bigger Astro boy waiting and he doesn't want to spoil it.

574
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:32,158
Speaker 1: Watch out behind you Pluto.

575
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:32,700
Speaker 1: It's Bora.

576
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:40,765
Speaker 0: All right, but I think we're gonna have to skip to the spoiler line because I want to talk about What makes this show great.

577
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:55,451
Speaker 0: basically master Keaton is a show that every episode is great and there's kind of this vague Thread about why is he called master Keaton and the answer to that is worth discussing because I think the show is more than just An episodic slice-of-life MacGyver off.

578
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:57,379
Speaker 0: I think it actually says something pretty meaningful.

579
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:04,160
Speaker 1: Well, I found out right that the manga ended early because of a dispute between urasawa and the other creator.

580
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:12,672
Speaker 1: There may have eventually been like some sort of conclusion or something along those lines But there never was because they stopped working on it.

581
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:18,820
Speaker 0: snap snap huh If I ever ever am in a position to interview urasawa.

582
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,717
Speaker 0: My only question is going to be how would you have ended master Keaton if no one could tell you otherwise?

583
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:27,570
Speaker 0: Yeah And I know he's not gonna give me some BS.

584
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:29,416
Speaker 0: Well, I can't tell you.

585
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:30,480
Speaker 1: actually you might give you that BS.

586
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:34,051
Speaker 0: He won't say I can't tell you what master Keaton was thinking.

587
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:37,933
Speaker 0: because I'm not master Keaton you would have to ask him Yeah, you won't give me that.

588
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:41,131
Speaker 1: no But he'll say he's not gonna give you the a real answer.

589
00:39:41,472 --> 00:39:44,444
Speaker 0: if you have not watched all of master Keaton Do not listen any further.

590
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:44,906
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk.

591
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,180
Speaker 0: We're gonna spoil fucking everything from this point forward.

592
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:51,752
Speaker 0: So last warning go watch master Keaton.

593
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,655
Speaker 0: You will like this show.

594
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:56,171
Speaker 0: I hope he's the master But he's not a professional.

595
00:39:56,513 --> 00:40:04,140
Speaker 0: Nope first Spoiler we got to talk about the specific spoiler episodes in the Poland of the Polish episode with the hotel on the island.

596
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:09,840
Speaker 0: Yep, the moment where he's basically the old man is like, yeah, I'm totally gonna help you guys out.

597
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,860
Speaker 0: He punches the punk kid and he's kind of just having wine with the guy in the shirt and war stories.

598
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:15,516
Speaker 0: And then he's like, yeah show me your gun.

599
00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:17,960
Speaker 0: The guy pulls out the gun points right at him.

600
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,322
Speaker 0: He's like.

601
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:22,822
Speaker 0: the trick I would use if I was gonna beat a guy like you would be to go like this guys like ha That's funny.

602
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:24,126
Speaker 0: and then he doesn't like.

603
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:28,200
Speaker 0: oh, yep that I cheered out loud when I watched that episode.

604
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:29,965
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

605
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:32,558
Speaker 0: I'm done master Keaton like busting through the window like right there.

606
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:36,473
Speaker 1: It was just too proud when master Keaton jumped through the window.

607
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:45,520
Speaker 1: That was like it's basically master Keaton's is a weird dude because like, you know, usually when you have a guy who's got mad skills at combat, right?

608
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,820
Speaker 1: You know or combat, you know fighting or violent it's straight up.

609
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,080
Speaker 0: I mean he was like a master chief or something and he fought in the Falkland war like straight up as special ops.

610
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

611
00:40:55,063 --> 00:41:00,020
Speaker 1: So whenever you have someone like that, they usually portrayed as some sort of badass, right?

612
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,260
Speaker 1: Even if they're nice as opposed to like a hard ass you get like a diehard guy, you know, he's nice.

613
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:07,090
Speaker 0: He just you might get the.

614
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:08,720
Speaker 0: I'm too old for this shit kind of guy.

615
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:09,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you get the.

616
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:10,619
Speaker 1: I'm too old for this shit.

617
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:15,092
Speaker 1: You never really get someone who's just like ultra nice and like mr.

618
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,900
Speaker 1: Rogers jumping through the window and kicking you in the face.

619
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, you never.

620
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,898
Speaker 0: you never derp de der never kicks your ass except in master Keaton.

621
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:23,359
Speaker 1: That's right.

622
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:26,412
Speaker 1: So, you know when like, you know, he like.

623
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,180
Speaker 1: he doesn't really like violence.

624
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:39,080
Speaker 1: He doesn't resort to violence unless he absolutely has to but when he has to when he has to he just does it and he's All you need is fucking kicks people's asses, even though he looks like he's totally unassuming.

625
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:43,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much every like the.

626
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:47,109
Speaker 0: I think the dog episode is still one of my favorites Because that trick like straight up.

627
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:49,480
Speaker 0: even my mom, you know, she's an expert in this thing.

628
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,226
Speaker 0: I showed her that episode and she's like.

629
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:56,401
Speaker 0: that is exactly what you should do and that would work very very well Yep.

630
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:56,481
Speaker 0: Yep.

631
00:41:57,124 --> 00:42:00,460
Speaker 1: But yeah, there's that Cali man of the desert episode you like so much.

632
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:12,400
Speaker 0: That episode just does it for me just because the whole thing builds to that moment where he stands up with that Spear in the desert over the horizon because he's trying to figure out what that you know.

633
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,633
Speaker 1: That's a good episode because it combines right and this is the thing like yet.

634
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:17,134
Speaker 1: What mr.

635
00:42:17,174 --> 00:42:19,060
Speaker 1: Keaton is an archi a master Keaton.

636
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,326
Speaker 1: He's an archaeologist.

637
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:26,106
Speaker 1: All right and an insurance investigator and A former SAS badass, right?

638
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:28,172
Speaker 1: So how can you combine these things in any way?

639
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:30,900
Speaker 0: that makes most episodes only use two aspects?

640
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only one.

641
00:42:32,824 --> 00:42:38,600
Speaker 1: but in the Cali man of the desert episode, right he goes somewhere because he's inspecting some insurance.

642
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:39,696
Speaker 1: That's why he's there.

643
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:46,740
Speaker 1: But there happens to be some archaeology going on and he's got this, you know, like archaeology.

644
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:50,034
Speaker 1: He's got this artifact and he's asking people what it does, but he doesn't know.

645
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:51,420
Speaker 0: of course I put out in that episode.

646
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,106
Speaker 0: He's asked for a boy there.

647
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:53,949
Speaker 0: There's all this dispute.

648
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,636
Speaker 0: He goes straight to the natives.

649
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:56,639
Speaker 0: He's like, what's the deal with this?

650
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,843
Speaker 0: Yep, right here.

651
00:42:57,964 --> 00:42:58,144
Speaker 0: Okay.

652
00:42:58,526 --> 00:42:59,529
Speaker 1: Yep.

653
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:05,670
Speaker 1: So, you know he goes and he's just taking care of business and Something happens and he gets stuck out.

654
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,260
Speaker 1: He gets put out in the desert to die.

655
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:15,119
Speaker 1: So now he brings in his SAS survival school skills to survive walking back from the desert without dying.

656
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:21,900
Speaker 1: and You know, they're basically watching him and they're like, yeah, they'll be dead in three days and first they're like, they'll be dead tomorrow.

657
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:24,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile, it's been like days.

658
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,320
Speaker 1: They're still alive still alive still alive and all the survival techniques they use would work.

659
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:35,920
Speaker 0: I just don't know like I don't think that I don't think anyone but master Keaton would have actually survived that that's true.

660
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,720
Speaker 0: Those other people could not have dealt with that.

661
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,300
Speaker 1: I also don't believe the degree to which they work.

662
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,056
Speaker 1: For example, he used various methods to get water in the desert.

663
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:48,356
Speaker 1: those work real Well, those work real well, but I did not believe he would have gotten the quantity of water necessary.

664
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,400
Speaker 0: You would be surprised.

665
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:51,560
Speaker 0: I've actually I've done that sort of thing.

666
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:58,440
Speaker 1: No, he would get water prop maybe even enough for one person, but I don't know if you'd get enough water.

667
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,127
Speaker 1: He was sharing it with all those other guys.

668
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,978
Speaker 0: I don't need that much water to keep yourself alive.

669
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:05,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

670
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,925
Speaker 1: I Question the quantity of why.

671
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:13,366
Speaker 0: I would say the only improbable part of that is that that other guy the complaining guy would have Died like right away immediately, of course.

672
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:15,091
Speaker 0: No in the real world, you know, what's unrealistic?

673
00:44:15,312 --> 00:44:17,840
Speaker 0: the master Keaton didn't just murder him right away.

674
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:19,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, drink his blood.

675
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:32,019
Speaker 0: Plus you got to admit the end of that episode is was gecky guy when he stands there with the spear in the distance Because he figures out that the artifact is actually a spear throwing device.

676
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,203
Speaker 1: So, you know any?

677
00:44:33,223 --> 00:44:39,110
Speaker 1: again the archaeology comes back and get right and he also knows that like the legend of the Cali man right Cuz?

678
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:39,902
Speaker 0: yeah He caught.

679
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:46,940
Speaker 1: you know master Keaton's the only one who knows about the local customs because he's so smart and he also knows that the people Who sent him out into the desert?

680
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:52,100
Speaker 1: The reason that they're in trouble is because you know the people that you know.

681
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:57,240
Speaker 1: The other archaeologists didn't weren't aware of or respectful of the local customs, right?

682
00:44:57,641 --> 00:45:04,608
Speaker 0: They like we're destroying this very important and the young play on the people who put him out There is like why don't we just go shoot him?

683
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:09,787
Speaker 0: and then the the elders like no He's the Cali man of the deserts.

684
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:10,810
Speaker 0: go get him.

685
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:11,411
Speaker 0: Give him water.

686
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:12,153
Speaker 0: Yep.

687
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:16,371
Speaker 0: That was gecky guy right there Super double gecky guy.

688
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:18,040
Speaker 0: That's why I like that episode.

689
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:24,000
Speaker 0: That's why I say that's the best episode, but I love a good half of the episodes in a big way.

690
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:31,180
Speaker 1: The other thing about this show is that like there were 24 or 25 TV episodes and the rest were OAV episodes.

691
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,427
Speaker 1: But you couldn't really tell the difference.

692
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:34,800
Speaker 0: not really the production values were watching it on DVD.

693
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:43,140
Speaker 1: You don't know that once some of these are directed discs and some of them were TV the production values remain Consistently high throughout the show is lushly animated.

694
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:49,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, this isn't like, you know, you would expect like with you know, 30 some odd episodes right that are you know?

695
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,307
Speaker 1: Some of them weren't?

696
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:54,930
Speaker 1: I've even on TV That you'd get lots of stock footage repetition.

697
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,660
Speaker 1: you'd get lots of panning across still shots.

698
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,779
Speaker 1: You know all the stuff that you see in shows like Rosa Versailles or antenna where?

699
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:05,146
Speaker 1: Even initial D just things, you know.

700
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:06,691
Speaker 1: and even Astro boy things.

701
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:07,875
Speaker 1: they do to save money.

702
00:46:08,155 --> 00:46:10,808
Speaker 1: speed lines zooming in and out Right, none of that.

703
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,680
Speaker 1: There's a lot of money went into the show.

704
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,333
Speaker 1: It must have been pretty popular in Japan or at least I'm pretty sure.

705
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:21,692
Speaker 1: the manga was really popular, you know I mean, you know Urasawa, I think Yara came before this.

706
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:30,020
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure this is another example of a show Where if you just marketed it right and just showed it to Americans dubbed and we're just like look at this.

707
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,520
Speaker 1: Well, I think that some people would like it, but I think it would for some people would be too slow and boring.

708
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,850
Speaker 0: You know, you'd have to market it to the right demographic.

709
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:39,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not the prime time HBO show.

710
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:41,780
Speaker 1: I actually think old people would like this.

711
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,315
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

712
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:44,827
Speaker 1: You put people watch a lot of TV.

713
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:48,719
Speaker 0: you put this on daytime TV like one o'clock on weekdays.

714
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:57,559
Speaker 1: Maybe not necessarily that but you know, maybe like primetime I'm like a cable network like, you know, TBS or USA or something.

715
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,867
Speaker 0: But what real I just remembered.

716
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:02,516
Speaker 0: remember the episode of that old man who's like hit.

717
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:05,631
Speaker 0: that guy shouldn't have died He didn't have the scent of death about him.

718
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:06,375
Speaker 0: Mmm.

719
00:47:06,496 --> 00:47:07,240
Speaker 0: I like that episode.

720
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:17,133
Speaker 0: But there's that one the episode where it's the flashback to Keaton's childhood like out of nowhere and the whole episode is just him As a kid and learning what it is to be a master of life.

721
00:47:17,755 --> 00:47:18,640
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a god.

722
00:47:18,942 --> 00:47:20,251
Speaker 0: That's when the show turned cuz.

723
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,380
Speaker 0: that's when they you know the whole time.

724
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,320
Speaker 0: They just call him master Keaton and they leave it at that.

725
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,972
Speaker 0: They don't like explore that and you don't think it's kind of like.

726
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:30,280
Speaker 0: you don't expect them to explore Why Superman is super after the origin story?

727
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,940
Speaker 1: Well, it's because when he was in the SAS in the survival training school, they called him the master.

728
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:38,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, you learn that and like the like the first episode it's like you're.

729
00:47:38,893 --> 00:47:40,539
Speaker 1: I remember you you're master.

730
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:48,677
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a great flashback because it comes to that guy like laying on the ground sucking and Keaton's like suck it up Nancy boy and Keaton just like walking like it's no problem.

731
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:51,993
Speaker 0: Yep But they you you don't even think.

732
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:52,896
Speaker 0: why is he called master?

733
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:53,680
Speaker 0: It's kind of like a nutenna.

734
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:54,466
Speaker 0: You don't think.

735
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,040
Speaker 0: why is the school so fucked up?

736
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,128
Speaker 0: Like there's so many shows where you don't think.

737
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:00,231
Speaker 0: why X?

738
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,940
Speaker 1: because you assume because they build an unrealist.

739
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:09,580
Speaker 1: It's the old trick of building an unrealistic status quo and such that you will not question it because it is the status quo.

740
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:12,846
Speaker 1: and then you know It's at least within the context of the show.

741
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:16,377
Speaker 1: and then they say hello real world.

742
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:16,898
Speaker 0: Remember?

743
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,851
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Now I'm gonna question that because it's not status quo.

744
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:24,880
Speaker 1: when you take it into the context of the real world Yeah, no did that pretty well and then you're surprised.

745
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:26,788
Speaker 1: But it's a classic trick.

746
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:29,500
Speaker 0: that episode brings it up because suddenly he meets that old man.

747
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,534
Speaker 0: There's the whole thing about being a master of life and what being a master of life means.

748
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:36,149
Speaker 0: and then later There's the references.

749
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:38,745
Speaker 0: the master Keaton's a master He's not a professional.

750
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:45,773
Speaker 0: and then in the last few episodes you start to run into Professionals and I think I'm just well I think it's.

751
00:48:45,814 --> 00:48:56,260
Speaker 1: you know It's sort of runs throughout the show because like whenever master Keaton does something like, you know Say when he's doing the negotiating right in the in one of those early episodes to get the the kidnapped husband back.

752
00:48:56,501 --> 00:49:05,296
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah when he's dealing with the terrorists who are in that building right, you know All right, when the the other guys were like we'll do this by the book.

753
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:08,938
Speaker 1: and he's like, you know You should shoot the hinges with the shotgun not the doorknob.

754
00:49:09,942 --> 00:49:10,945
Speaker 1: Alright, you know.

755
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:18,270
Speaker 1: so, you know, but people basically always when they once they realize that master Keaton is actually the master They're like, oh, he's a pro.

756
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:23,112
Speaker 1: They always say like Oh pro da You know that they say that like all throughout the show.

757
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:35,980
Speaker 0: So so many characters like ah Pro days, but I think the point of the show is just that master Keaton is kind of a master Like he's a master of life and that he's excelled in all these areas.

758
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,656
Speaker 0: He's become 90% badass and 90% derp to der and 90% like good father.

759
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:45,259
Speaker 0: like he's doing all these things He's enjoying life, but yet he is skilled.

760
00:49:45,801 --> 00:49:57,482
Speaker 0: But the people who are the 100% badasses effectively the Duke Togo's or like the guy in the last two episodes Be by becoming the professional by becoming the ultimate badass the.

761
00:49:57,502 --> 00:49:59,186
Speaker 0: I can kill people.

762
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:00,650
Speaker 0: I'm super badass.

763
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,890
Speaker 0: They lose out on being a master of life.

764
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,435
Speaker 0: They don't actually live their lives.

765
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:09,690
Speaker 0: their lives just are being the knife being the assassin being the terrorists.

766
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:14,379
Speaker 1: Yep, the other thing that the master Keaton does really well is the same thing that spider-man does.

767
00:50:14,439 --> 00:50:20,630
Speaker 1: right is Spider-man was totally awesome because unlike say Superman right spider-man has failings.

768
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,272
Speaker 1: But what they?

769
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:27,110
Speaker 1: what you do when you want to make an awesome character with failings like spider-man or master Keaton is you put?

770
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:31,424
Speaker 1: The failings into a different aspect of life from the hero wing right?

771
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:34,677
Speaker 1: so when you watch an episode of master Keaton What's he doing most of the time?

772
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:41,940
Speaker 1: He's most of the time doing the things he's really good at archaeology insurance inspecting and SAS ass kicking and surviving right.

773
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:44,170
Speaker 1: so that what they did is they said okay?

774
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:48,850
Speaker 1: We need to make a show where the guy who's so badass or manga where he's so badass at all these things.

775
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:52,789
Speaker 1: But if that's all the show is about it'll just be Duke Togo, so what do we do?

776
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,502
Speaker 1: We make every other aspect of his life sort of fail right?

777
00:50:56,783 --> 00:50:58,730
Speaker 1: he's failed at you know his wife.

778
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:02,770
Speaker 1: He can't actually get an archaeology job even though he's really good at archaeology.

779
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:17,570
Speaker 1: You know he's failing at all these things that don't actually matter in the show that much or even they just like they just present Them to you as a way to craft the character of master Keaton even though those things aren't part of the plot.

780
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:23,310
Speaker 1: So he's still an ultimate badass hero when it comes to the plot of any given episode.

781
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:31,779
Speaker 1: But his character is still you know an actual normal human being you can relate to Who has failings and such and such.

782
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:32,040
Speaker 1: well?

783
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,426
Speaker 0: Why is he a master of life?

784
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:34,290
Speaker 0: It's partly his outlook.

785
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:37,590
Speaker 0: I mean he's derp-de-der in all these aspects, but he's happy.

786
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:43,770
Speaker 0: He's really really really happy when he succeeds and when he fails and he really doesn't he doesn't really get upset.

787
00:51:44,673 --> 00:52:00,726
Speaker 0: But look at the professionals in the show like I think is the first or second episode after Calum out of the desert when the Direct-to-DVD stuff starts where there's the where the bodyguards get killed and he's got that like KGB guy He's fighting with or the last two episodes all the professionals are miserable.

788
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:05,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're absolutely Presented as you know miserable kind of guys.

789
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:05,621
Speaker 0: or they're.

790
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:11,175
Speaker 0: they're so tied up in their profession that if they fail That's their entire life They can't live life.

791
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:19,110
Speaker 0: and it all comes back to that flashback episode where what it is to be a master of life and The whole point of the show I think is that master Keaton is a master of life.

792
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,976
Speaker 1: You know he says he's not a master of life.

793
00:52:21,056 --> 00:52:26,195
Speaker 0: if you want to be you know the Strider in the debt It's this burning wheel.

794
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,870
Speaker 0: if you want to be the loner badass you suck and your life sucks.

795
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:35,370
Speaker 0: You've got to be the cool guy with some flaws and some faults who just enjoys life, and yeah master Keaton

796
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:45,330
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean even like think about the episode where like someone who may or may not be his actual sister Right is like gonna kill themselves, and he doesn't really get upset.

797
00:52:45,572 --> 00:52:46,316
Speaker 1: You know he go.

798
00:52:46,336 --> 00:52:49,736
Speaker 1: you know like he goes to D deals with it But he's not like.

799
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:54,529
Speaker 1: he's not shaken at all not whatsoever He just he takes care of business.

800
00:52:55,212 --> 00:53:00,353
Speaker 1: You know like he obviously doesn't want her to kill herself and when he you know realizes gonna happen He's like oh shit.

801
00:53:00,434 --> 00:53:06,239
Speaker 1: How come I didn't see it sooner, but he's not like you know like okay He doesn't freak out or ever have like an attack.

802
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:13,830
Speaker 1: It doesn't really cry about anything unless it's like You know just something that's sort of you know like you know a normal reason.

803
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:22,949
Speaker 1: you know he's very emotionally like totally under control and usually as a pleasant and You know bright demeanor cheery demeanor.

804
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:34,790
Speaker 0: Remember the episode where there's the guy who wants to compose music again But he can't because his dad isn't a bastard anymore and the key has to make his dad be an asshole again.

805
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, see how quirky the show is.

806
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:48,684
Speaker 0: it ranges from like dead serious Russian guy on the run like expert knife fighter might kill Keaton Professional blah blah blah - my dad's got to be an asshole or I can't compose music.

807
00:53:48,705 --> 00:53:49,306
Speaker 0: Can you help me?

808
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:50,350
Speaker 1: Yeah?

809
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:57,890
Speaker 1: Make my dad be a jerk to me again Because that's the only thing that motivated me was showing my dad that he sucks.

810
00:53:58,392 --> 00:54:02,022
Speaker 1: So now that my dad's a homeless bum right who's got nothing in the world.

811
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,309
Speaker 1: I have no motivation anymore because I've won.

812
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:12,344
Speaker 0: I Don't know if I'd ever watch the entire show again But I don't think I could definitely watch very specific key episodes again.

813
00:54:12,564 --> 00:54:14,330
Speaker 0: in the process of showing them to other people.

814
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,210
Speaker 1: I have a feeling what it would be is it would be a long time.

815
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,497
Speaker 1: You know cuz I would forget them.

816
00:54:18,517 --> 00:54:20,286
Speaker 1: so that way when I watched him again.

817
00:54:20,306 --> 00:54:26,170
Speaker 0: It'd be like oh Remember next time we have to show people something out of the blue like we need something to watch.

818
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:32,425
Speaker 0: I just want to show people that the island hotel episode It wasn't wasn't like the island of the coward or the hotel of the coward.

819
00:54:32,445 --> 00:54:33,310
Speaker 1: It was something like that.

820
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:34,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would.

821
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:35,461
Speaker 0: I want to watch that episode.

822
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:36,043
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

823
00:54:36,224 --> 00:54:37,290
Speaker 0: I just I'd like that episode.

824
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:38,454
Speaker 0: Yeah that in the wine.

825
00:54:39,096 --> 00:54:43,510
Speaker 1: The thing is right is that there is a little bit of knowledge you need right?

826
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:50,290
Speaker 1: Even though there's no continuity There are certain episodes where it's like, you know Keaton is just there and then he's badass.

827
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:55,877
Speaker 1: And if you don't if you didn't watch an earlier episode and all you need to know is that he was in the SAS He was a badass.

828
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:57,230
Speaker 0: episode one takes care of that.

829
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,330
Speaker 0: Yeah show people episode one and then any other episode exactly.

830
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:03,970
Speaker 1: But it's like if you didn't watch at least the episode one and know that Keaton was a badass.

831
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:05,941
Speaker 1: It'd be like you wouldn't believe.

832
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:12,875
Speaker 0: it's like it wouldn't like watching mr Rogers and suddenly like a guy jumps through the window with a knife and Roger stabs him and then continues with the show You're like what?

833
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:24,730
