1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,243
Speaker 1: It's Monday March 5th 2018.

2
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:12,765
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:16,760
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is a geek night's tech news roundup.

4
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:20,666
Speaker 0: Let's do this Every year around this time.

5
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,734
Speaker 1: I run out of Monday show ideas.

6
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:24,400
Speaker 0: No you run out of Monday show.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:34,880
Speaker 0: I'd like up two months before now about the in late March and then You always want to do tech news roundup on every Monday because you don't have any ideas.

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:46,992
Speaker 0: I would just make tech news roundup the show yeah, but We either managed to either come up with a bad idea or bail on every other Monday show Yeah, and then eventually when it becomes March again rim is like so excited.

9
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:54,120
Speaker 0: He can now have it's a tech news round Free permission to do the tech news roundup once a year.

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,720
Speaker 0: So I don't want to say hit points mana because that clock does ring yeah rings once a year.

11
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:03,120
Speaker 0: In fact the last tech news roundup was a year and a day ago.

12
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:05,749
Speaker 0: There was no another episode last year.

13
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:08,257
Speaker 0: that was not tech news roundup.

14
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:12,959
Speaker 0: it was all Listeners submitted tech news roundup so that one does not count.

15
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:14,245
Speaker 1: That's true.

16
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:18,060
Speaker 1: That's true, but I still think about talking about a moment.

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:27,211
Speaker 0: I'm still thinking about changing the format of Monday, but cuz you have no ideas for Monday shows though if you like Monday show You should help out Monday show by sending in some ideas.

18
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:33,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, so uh before we get into the baby Okay, there's no I will probably shoot it down.

19
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:37,056
Speaker 1: There is no news other than the tech news for obvious reasons.

20
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:41,740
Speaker 1: so uh I Went skiing this weekend, and you know I you might if you heard me.

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,280
Speaker 1: I think I've occasionally said this on geek nice But I tend to go to hunter mountain because it's the best skiing within like a day trip of New York City.

22
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:49,351
Speaker 0: So it's not great.

23
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:50,039
Speaker 0: It's not that great.

24
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:57,303
Speaker 0: But if you want to go there you always go there to the same mountain and whenever other people talk about that mountain They're like man.

25
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,751
Speaker 0: that is crappy skiing actually.

26
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:58,952
Speaker 1: no.

27
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:07,527
Speaker 1: so when I talk to other people about that mountain They always say the same thing that I say which is that's the best mountain Within a day trip of New York City.

28
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:08,830
Speaker 1: there are better places.

29
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:11,680
Speaker 0: the thing is you can't reach some Pocono Mountain within a day.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,969
Speaker 1: Oh, those mountains are bullshit.

31
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,634
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

32
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:14,480
Speaker 1: I've skied down there.

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,324
Speaker 1: That's a bullshit.

34
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:25,699
Speaker 1: mountains that place that everything in the Poconos is garbage as far as I'm concerned Uh-huh, but so there's hunter mountain, and there's Wyndham Mountain Which is actually the same distance is owned by a hotel.

35
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,347
Speaker 1: No, I think it's spelled differently.

36
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:28,808
Speaker 0: Okay.

37
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:29,872
Speaker 1: It's just Wyndham Mountain.

38
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,960
Speaker 1: It's this other mountain, so I go to hunter.

39
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:40,278
Speaker 1: I've never been to Wyndham But I talk shit about Wyndham a lot and I have for a decade you talk shit about a place you never been Judging it without trying it.

40
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:40,920
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,751
Speaker 1: So now now I've been to Wyndham and now I know the fullness.

42
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,842
Speaker 1: now if I want to go a little further like if I Went real skiing.

43
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:47,746
Speaker 1: There's not a day trip.

44
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:51,199
Speaker 1: I could go to Killington, but even then Killington's like a five-hour drive.

45
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,569
Speaker 0: Vermont Yeah, yeah, that's real.

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,339
Speaker 1: it's like a five-hour drive But Killington's kind of shit because if you drive just a couple more hours you get to Bretton Woods and Loon and the good shit.

47
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,446
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's all orthogonal to this discussion.

48
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:04,168
Speaker 1: So

49
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:04,990
Speaker 0: I got a hunter and

50
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:23,520
Speaker 1: The reason I never went to Wyndham wasn't just that I went to hunter first But it was that when I read reviews or talk to people about stupid hunter versus Wyndham Mountain They'd always say that Hunter has better expert terrain and the old-timers ski there and Wyndham is all just snowboarders smoking pot.

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,891
Speaker 1: That idea was reinforced.

52
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:47,609
Speaker 1: when I take this bus out of Manhattan That's how I get up there to ski usually and what I always noticed over all these years the last decade of going up there on this bus is that There'd be a ton of people standing by the new victory theater in Manhattan and Times Square and a bunch of buses would come up and one by one the buses are like hunter or Wyndham without fail.

53
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:58,946
Speaker 1: the people who got on the hunter bus Were old-timers or people like me who had their own skis and were just standing there quietly and they're gonna go up there and ski and without fail.

54
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:10,237
Speaker 1: almost everyone who got on the Wyndham bus were first-time snowboarders going on some sort of package trip most of whom did not even have their own snowboards.

55
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:21,132
Speaker 1: and Then I'd read that the lift capacity was low and the mountains not that high and all the so I finally had the displeasure of going to Wyndham Mountain and all I learned why would you go to it?

56
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:29,520
Speaker 1: because Hunter Mountain and Bel Air and basically the entire region upstate had no power this weekend because of that giant blizzard.

57
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,540
Speaker 0: So Wyndham Mountain was the only one with power?

58
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,784
Speaker 0: Wyndham Mountain was the only one with power.

59
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,212
Speaker 0: So the ski mountain was closed after a blizzard.

60
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,320
Speaker 0: Shouldn't that be when the ski mountains opened?

61
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:41,494
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, do you know how much money hunter mountain lost out on because of that that?

62
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,080
Speaker 0: can they get the money back from insurance?

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,483
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

64
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:48,214
Speaker 1: It was basically a disaster for them to not be open on Saturday.

65
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,240
Speaker 1: Okay, like ridiculous disaster.

66
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,560
Speaker 1: So, uh, I ended up my bus just went to Wyndham instead.

67
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:56,172
Speaker 0: Maybe it wasn't a disaster because then no one died this way.

68
00:04:56,936 --> 00:05:00,560
Speaker 1: Um, yeah So only four people have died at hunter in like the last five years.

69
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,985
Speaker 1: That was gonna be the day they got saved by the power and as far as I can tell one of them was that lady Who fell off the ski lift.

70
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,857
Speaker 1: the other three were people who were doing something they shouldn't have.

71
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:14,886
Speaker 1: but uh Wyndham Mountain lived up to every negative expectation I have ever encountered.

72
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,029
Speaker 1: it was like it was.

73
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,613
Speaker 1: it was literally a Simpsons.

74
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,177
Speaker 1: Lisa opened the envelope.

75
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:20,140
Speaker 1: I gave you moments.

76
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:30,107
Speaker 1: So now not only can I continue to talk shit about Wyndham But I've been there and I have first-hand evidence that I was in fact 100% of crack correct from the beginning.

77
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 1: you can always judge a book by its cover and a rough spotty reading of its reviews.

78
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:45,486
Speaker 1: So you got any non tech news roundup before we get into the tech news roundup, not really not really it's cold That's it's nice out.

79
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:45,908
Speaker 1: It's cold.

80
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,173
Speaker 1: It's pretty warm out.

81
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,960
Speaker 0: Oh, it's gonna snow on Wednesday's cold.

82
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:52,890
Speaker 1: I think you're just aging at a preternaturally high rate cold.

83
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,958
Speaker 1: I mean I would wear shorts if I was biking in this weather.

84
00:05:56,098 --> 00:06:08,330
Speaker 1: Nope But anyway before we get into the tech news roundup it time for things of the day.

85
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:10,441
Speaker 1: What do you got so?

86
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:15,473
Speaker 0: Way back at the first time we went to gamer X Right.

87
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:26,207
Speaker 0: There was a demo going on in a little in the room the sort of like the artist alley equivalent Right of this cute little pixely game involving a spider webbing stuff up.

88
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:31,645
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, and that was like the most amazing tiny game I had ever seen.

89
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:43,810
Speaker 0: and this tiny game was made With this engine called Pico 8. and what Pico 8 is if you don't know is a video game engine Basically simulating a video game console that never existed.

90
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,479
Speaker 0: It's like they made up a video game console that never existed.

91
00:06:47,001 --> 00:07:00,430
Speaker 0: that is very simple and pixely somewhere Slightly better than an Atari 2600 but nowhere near an NES sort of situation I assume without the like chase the beam type nonsense, right?

92
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,831
Speaker 0: No, it's.

93
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:04,910
Speaker 0: it's you know, but it's it's modern programming wise like with Lua and such.

94
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,909
Speaker 0: It's made to be very easy to program.

95
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:14,518
Speaker 0: you can make bright and colorful simple games and other programs with it and this really amazing spider game was made like.

96
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:29,103
Speaker 0: I was shocked at how amazing this game was for the limitations afforded by the Not actually a real physical console the Pico 8 And the developer of that game was I don't know how to pronounce their internet name Which looks like bridges with the e removed

97
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:30,395
Speaker 1: British dev Right

98
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:35,310
Speaker 0: But yeah, so ever since then that game amazed me so much.

99
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:44,170
Speaker 0: I followed this person on Twitter and they recently began tweeting Links to their YouTube channel, which has basically nobody watching it of them.

100
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,506
Speaker 1: I'm the fifth person to like this 13 views guys.

101
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:47,130
Speaker 1: Come on, right?

102
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:53,738
Speaker 0: And these are the most amazing and complete Pico 8 dev Tutorials and also pixel art.

103
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,290
Speaker 0: right because you need to both skills to make games in Pico 8.

104
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:04,230
Speaker 0: You need the pixel art skills and also the programming skills But it's not very high levels of either one because it's low resolution and simple programming, right?

105
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:20,310
Speaker 0: It's like you need skills, but not that much right, but this person is made that amazing spider game and has increased their skills two years worth in that time and is still Maybe the Pico 8 master of the world as far as I can tell because I don't know any other Pico 8 masters.

106
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:28,295
Speaker 0: So if you want to program amazing simple games for Pico 8 or just be amazed at someone else doing it You need to watch this.

107
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:33,621
Speaker 0: this is like even though I'm probably never gonna make a Pico 8 anything I still watch this whole video.

108
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:34,909
Speaker 1: dude watching this already.

109
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:42,198
Speaker 1: They've convinced me to want to at least make like the simplest possible make a Tetris or something I don't know, right?

110
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,809
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's more than just this one.

111
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:48,907
Speaker 0: We're gonna link to the one video but check the whole channel and you can see a lot more.

112
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:49,710
Speaker 0: I got good stuff.

113
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,393
Speaker 0: I feel like there.

114
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,643
Speaker 0: it seems like they're continuing a whole series.

115
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,456
Speaker 0: That's gonna keep going and So it'll be worth your while.

116
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:59,729
Speaker 0: yeah a great way to just learn programming in general, too.

117
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:02,989
Speaker 1: So a lot of you are probably familiar with a song.

118
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:04,414
Speaker 1: Hey, mrs.

119
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,701
Speaker 1: Robinson, like mrs.

120
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,009
Speaker 1: Robinson is a song that people know.

121
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:21,969
Speaker 1: if you if you don't know anything about music if you hear the song of like Oh that song the song that like dad and grandpa always listen to but it's a song Scott always A lot of our listeners are like a full generation younger than even us.

122
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,630
Speaker 1: So, do you know the story of how that song was written?

123
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,189
Speaker 0: Simon and Garfunkel made a song or what it's about?

124
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:33,656
Speaker 1: vaguely, so On the dick of that show.

125
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:34,620
Speaker 0: dick have it.

126
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,785
Speaker 1: I've never seen this show.

127
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,950
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about this dick.

128
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,709
Speaker 0: Have it is Oh No incredibly famous person.

129
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:48,363
Speaker 1: This is not my interest in music focused mostly on Composition and classical dick have it wasn't music shows.

130
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,088
Speaker 1: It was a late show, which I also don't care about.

131
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:50,570
Speaker 1: Okay?

132
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway Paul Simon was on the show 1970.

133
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:53,779
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

134
00:09:54,701 --> 00:10:00,844
Speaker 1: And this is a short segment where Paul Simon Explains the origin of the song.

135
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:01,226
Speaker 1: mrs.

136
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:07,569
Speaker 1: Robinson Mm-hmm, and the origin of the song was actually not what I expected at all and it's kind of funny.

137
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,134
Speaker 1: So I recommend you watch this.

138
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,999
Speaker 1: It's just a really good short interview.

139
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:23,359
Speaker 1: this short segment where Paul Simon describes how the song Robinson was written What it means and you can take that information and do with it what thou wilt in the meta moment.

140
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,750
Speaker 1: the book club book is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

141
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:34,010
Speaker 0: I'm doing a real bad job of continuing to read it after my finishing of the introduction, dude

142
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:35,762
Speaker 1: I am so as soon as you once I keep

143
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:36,810
Speaker 0: doing other stuff instead

144
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:42,330
Speaker 1: Read the first chapter like the first book of it and then you'll just get into a cadence because it yeah.

145
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:42,835
Speaker 0: But I got.

146
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,616
Speaker 0: actually I'm doing all this other stuff Like I don't like.

147
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:50,093
Speaker 0: that is not like it didn't even when I even when I had free time like oh What should I do now?

148
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:54,950
Speaker 0: There were three attractive PC games calling me and I went and did that instead.

149
00:10:55,874 --> 00:11:04,270
Speaker 0: but following Telemachus through his Interactions with I find it surprising that you're like you're really on the Telemachus boat.

150
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,576
Speaker 1: When was the Odyssey?

151
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:07,398
Speaker 0: Odysseus boat?

152
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:11,530
Speaker 1: the first half of the stupid book is just Telemachus going around like where's my dad?

153
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,859
Speaker 1: And then it cuts back to.

154
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,406
Speaker 1: so where was Odysseus?

155
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,310
Speaker 0: yes a good part.

156
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,561
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's I claps the Telemachus that siren.

157
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:26,067
Speaker 0: the Telemachus stuff is pretty excited Because in this modern context I guess I meet up with Agamemnon or Agamemnon's wife at some point.

158
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,129
Speaker 1: Well right now He's hanging out with Menelaus.

159
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,457
Speaker 1: Actually, just hang out with Menelaus.

160
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:31,260
Speaker 0: Is it Menelaus?

161
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:33,850
Speaker 0: Isn't that Agamemnon's wife or something?

162
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,296
Speaker 1: Menelaus is not Agamemnon's wife.

163
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,258
Speaker 0: Who is Menelaus?

164
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,341
Speaker 0: That was someone important.

165
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:38,662
Speaker 0: I forget.

166
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:39,364
Speaker 1: He's a king.

167
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:45,245
Speaker 0: I At this point I knew who Menelaus was and I forgot.

168
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,290
Speaker 1: you'll find out a lot about him.

169
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:52,259
Speaker 1: what I forgot was I mixed up Calypso and Clemnestra and Cersei like the three of them.

170
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,383
Speaker 1: I got sorted out in my head now.

171
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,227
Speaker 0: Cersei's the witch.

172
00:11:54,287 --> 00:12:01,623
Speaker 1: I know the other Calypso's the first goddess Odysseus was having sex with And it's interesting that this translation.

173
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:02,488
Speaker 1: It's not so much.

174
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,825
Speaker 1: Odysseus was trapped there longing for home while this goddess sext him.

175
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:07,509
Speaker 1: It was more like.

176
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,919
Speaker 1: Eventually, Odysseus got bored with this and wanted to go home.

177
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:12,561
Speaker 0: That's right.

178
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,672
Speaker 1: There's a subtle change in the tone of that conversation That's right.

179
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:22,948
Speaker 1: I do feel like I would have stayed with Calypso to be perfectly honest.

180
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,619
Speaker 1: Of course Because half the other people talking about Odysseus.

181
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,649
Speaker 0: But rich people also think they're gonna stay on that island and then they don't.

182
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:42,929
Speaker 1: Yeah well Meanwhile, look at the reason the Telemachus part is so interesting because he basically just goes to all these other kings or people like his father and sees what their deal is and their deals are all pretty different.

183
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:46,755
Speaker 1: and Some of them got it going on pretty well.

184
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,021
Speaker 1: and anyway read this story.

185
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,829
Speaker 1: if you've never read the Odyssey read this translation.

186
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:57,490
Speaker 1: if The Odyssey bored you when you tried to read it a long time ago, and we'll talk about in the Ginkgo's book club.

187
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,023
Speaker 1: I don't want to really spoil anything about the Odyssey if you don't know what's going on.

188
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:01,926
Speaker 0: Spoil the Odyssey.

189
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:06,119
Speaker 0: Yeah I Love I just love you.

190
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,229
Speaker 0: spoil the Bible names.

191
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,937
Speaker 1: Anita's like yo Zeus, like.

192
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,502
Speaker 1: can you let Odysseus go home?

193
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,710
Speaker 1: And he's like, man, I want to let him go home.

194
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,114
Speaker 1: He's like the only smart human.

195
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:15,897
Speaker 0: just spoil us.

196
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:16,098
Speaker 0: just.

197
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:18,626
Speaker 0: well Dracula, but fucking Poseidon.

198
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:19,950
Speaker 1: Just what are you gonna do Frank?

199
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:21,390
Speaker 0: What do you want me to do about Poseidon?

200
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,837
Speaker 1: Like the half the stories of the Greek gods are yeah, but Poseidon is being a little piss, baby And I don't know what to do about it.

201
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:29,923
Speaker 1: What do you want me to do?

202
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:30,748
Speaker 1: I can't stop him.

203
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,268
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah.

204
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:40,673
Speaker 1: Anyway, you should read that book and the previous book club book it which is still on the ignites website the fifth season by NK jemisin.

205
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:45,870
Speaker 1: if you haven't read that you should read that first because I don't know when Scott's gonna finish the finish.

206
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,335
Speaker 0: And other meta news.

207
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,683
Speaker 0: the most important meta news is that PAX East 2018 is ridiculously soon.

208
00:13:56,652 --> 00:14:00,165
Speaker 0: Book my train less than a month ish away.

209
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:01,330
Speaker 1: I gotta write this panel.

210
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:04,318
Speaker 0: It is super duper soon.

211
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:10,050
Speaker 0: It is four days Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and Thursday and Sunday are not sold out.

212
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:17,775
Speaker 1: you can totally go to those and as we've said Thursday and Sunday at PAX East are some of the best bang for your buck of Gaming convention.

213
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:25,730
Speaker 0: I think Thursday is just like a no-brainer to take off work and go for the one day Full packs day low attendance and you get the keynote Q&A the beginning.

214
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:35,404
Speaker 1: But Sunday if you can't take time off and you can't generally afford to go to cons It's one day where you could see the entire expo hall see some panels play a bunch

215
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:39,399
Speaker 0: of games and see the omega-thon finale But you'll get a few hours less than your other days of bags.

216
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you will see us on Sunday, won't you?

217
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:46,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a really shitty panel time But better than no panel early in the morning at 10 30 a.m.

218
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:54,522
Speaker 1: Scott and I will be on Sunday April 8th in the arachnid theater doing the Fully evolved form of our 40 tabletop games.

219
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,790
Speaker 1: You must play panel, which is not just clickbait.

220
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:00,023
Speaker 1: There's legit learning and content in.

221
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,609
Speaker 1: here is just title is a trick.

222
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:05,679
Speaker 0: Yeah most articles that have clickbait titles that have clickbait content.

223
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,069
Speaker 0: we use a clickbait title to fill the seats and then have real content.

224
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,933
Speaker 1: and What we learned from?

225
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:13,510
Speaker 1: mag fast because we've been shying away from clickbait titles for a while.

226
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:15,983
Speaker 1: Holy shit, does the clickbait title fill the room?

227
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:18,234
Speaker 1: It works like yeah Why wouldn't it work?

228
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,302
Speaker 0: and you know, it works.

229
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,044
Speaker 0: just do you have the.

230
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,289
Speaker 0: are you shameless enough to do it?

231
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,364
Speaker 0: And rim is and Scott isn't.

232
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:24,990
Speaker 0: that's how it works.

233
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:31,634
Speaker 1: I mean remember we did our bad games panel that filled the goddamn room and they all thought we're gonna talk about like Avgn type stuff.

234
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:31,895
Speaker 1: Nope.

235
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:32,458
Speaker 1: Yep.

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,818
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, we'll see you at PAX East and also Even though it's four days.

237
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:38,923
Speaker 1: There's an open question.

238
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,723
Speaker 1: Will there be Wednesday pre packs gaming.

239
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:44,030
Speaker 1: Yes, and the answer is yes.

240
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:49,550
Speaker 1: So you could make PAX East a five-day con for all intents and purposes.

241
00:15:51,771 --> 00:16:04,310
Speaker 0: Also in the meta you should go onto the internet and go if you mean you're listening to this podcast already or somehow If you're really sad watching any watching a live stream, you're one of those sad ten people watching this live.

242
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,678
Speaker 0: You should know that there's like a podcast.

243
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:09,990
Speaker 0: you can just get an mp3 and at least and it's still sad.

244
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,970
Speaker 0: So listen to us for an hour, but at least you could do it while doing something else.

245
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,730
Speaker 0: You don't have to look at our stupid faces if you're listening to the podcast.

246
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,820
Speaker 0: Well, if you are sadder than I think hope you are.

247
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:26,514
Speaker 0: you can watch a live stream of this instead on YouTube But also there are.

248
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:38,390
Speaker 0: we have many websites and social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram And even a Facebook page and we got a forum and you should go Because apparently you just love us that much.

249
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:47,430
Speaker 0: You should go on the internet to all the other places that we publish things and follow Subscribe and whatever you do there if that's something you really want to do.

250
00:16:47,570 --> 00:17:03,047
Speaker 0: But if you take my advice, you'll unsubscribe not listen Never come to us again and go do something more valuable with your time Like play a good video game or watch an erudite movie or read the Odyssey Something like that.

251
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:09,349
Speaker 1: So I think it's time for the tech news roundup, mmm, so I put these in a vague order.

252
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,228
Speaker 1: We're just gonna go right through them.

253
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:17,250
Speaker 1: So first off the most important is the only tech news many of you care about right now is can I buy a GPU?

254
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, I talked about this before and you still can't buy a GPU yet.

255
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:21,144
Speaker 0: Yep.

256
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:22,790
Speaker 1: People are still mining their magic beans.

257
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,262
Speaker 1: So if you if you're trying to build a new computer, you're just aft.

258
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:29,755
Speaker 1: I just like I use 770 and just wait.

259
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:33,210
Speaker 0: I was so lucky and that my one computer was all busted, right?

260
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:39,310
Speaker 0: And then my HTPC was you know doing fine and I. but I needed to buy a new computer.

261
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,223
Speaker 0: So I did but I couldn't get a GPU for it.

262
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,798
Speaker 0: Even though the RAM was overpriced I was willing to pay for the overpriced RAM.

263
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, but cuz I heard a room wise RAM overpriced.

264
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:49,433
Speaker 1: I bought I paid.

265
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,621
Speaker 1: I paid so little for my RAM.

266
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:52,565
Speaker 0: How much was your RAM?

267
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:53,910
Speaker 1: I gotta go look again.

268
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,079
Speaker 1: all I know is I paid so little that I Originally just put 64 gig in.

269
00:17:58,099 --> 00:17:59,164
Speaker 1: cuz why the fuck not?

270
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,270
Speaker 1: it was so cheap.

271
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,536
Speaker 0: I got 32, but the.

272
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:04,570
Speaker 0: I've heard that actually the GPUs are not there in shortage.

273
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:07,849
Speaker 0: It's that they can't make video cards because they don't have enough video RAM.

274
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,998
Speaker 0: I heard True or not though that could.

275
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:12,986
Speaker 0: it could be GPUs and RAM for all I know.

276
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,035
Speaker 0: But anyway What was I saying?

277
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:28,370
Speaker 0: right but I was lucky that my HTPC had a 1070 in it that I had bought at a reasonable price way back and so I just transfer that to my desktop and now my My HTPC just doesn't have a GPU in it.

278
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,099
Speaker 0: But that's fine because I rarely use the GPU in the HTPC.

279
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,966
Speaker 1: I mean my HTPC has a 460 in it.

280
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:39,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is I was thinking aha I'll go get a 1050 to put in that HTPC.

281
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:41,570
Speaker 0: now that I know it doesn't really need much more than that.

282
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,170
Speaker 0: Ah shit them 1050s are overpriced too those.

283
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:47,890
Speaker 1: So I I literally just lucked out and bought it.

284
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:53,270
Speaker 1: I basically bought my 1080 at the bottom possible price for a 1080.

285
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,955
Speaker 0: Here's the problem is.

286
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:56,430
Speaker 0: you think I can go get like a 950 or something, right?

287
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,917
Speaker 0: But here's the thing though.

288
00:18:57,997 --> 00:19:06,390
Speaker 0: the 10 series like the 1070 Uses way less power way less than the 680 that I was replacing.

289
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:13,350
Speaker 0: I actually sold that 680 to a listener because the 680 couldn't go in the HTPC used too much power and was.

290
00:19:14,312 --> 00:19:16,900
Speaker 0: Yet the 1070 is orders of magnitude faster.

291
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,773
Speaker 0: Maybe not but it's many many percent faster and use Electricity.

292
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:25,448
Speaker 1: that's why I was like, hey you want my 770 because that has pretty much the same problem.

293
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:27,473
Speaker 0: No Too much power.

294
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,259
Speaker 0: It's way not it's not efficient at all.

295
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:30,985
Speaker 0: There's your GPUs.

296
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:32,650
Speaker 0: nose fuck everyone with coins.

297
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,459
Speaker 0: Yep, you got your mining coins get fucked.

298
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,322
Speaker 1: Here's the news.

299
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,590
Speaker 1: that's interesting from a bunch of perspectives.

300
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,470
Speaker 1: Apparently a bunch of people are pirating features of Spotify, right?

301
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,310
Speaker 0: So if you get Spotify for free, which you can do it's very limited.

302
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,858
Speaker 0: First of all, it's loaded with ads.

303
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:51,330
Speaker 0: you have to listen to ads after you listen to music.

304
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:56,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you can only skip songs in a playlist like so many times if you like the radio mode.

305
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:04,750
Speaker 0: and eventually it's like Disables your skip button and you have to actually like do something else to skip around and listen to different songs and whatnot.

306
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,487
Speaker 0: Right as it turns out.

307
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:11,485
Speaker 0: Some of these features are implemented server-side and cannot be circumvented by.

308
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,545
Speaker 0: if you're not paying for a Spotify you know.

309
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:23,470
Speaker 0: but other features were implemented client-side and could be Circumvented if you simply don't use the official Spotify client and use some evil pirated Spotify client.

310
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,419
Speaker 1: So like here's here's a synthetic example.

311
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,930
Speaker 1: I'm not saying this is what they did, but this to give you some perspective.

312
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:29,910
Speaker 1: So say I got in Spotify.

313
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:37,339
Speaker 1: There's the skip button and when you hit that button It makes like a web a call to a web service that says hey skip to the next song Mm-hmm.

314
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:46,450
Speaker 1: So the while you clicked on something in the GUI in the browser It called an API somewhere in the sky for Spotify to do a thing did a thing.

315
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:50,830
Speaker 1: So let's say that in the GUI I just disable that button.

316
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:54,264
Speaker 1: Well, the user is using Spotify.

317
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:55,810
Speaker 1: if I know enough information.

318
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:04,276
Speaker 1: I could just with like curl or something or basically any script hit that API directly Because it's accessible via the internet.

319
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:07,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's on the internet the clients connecting to it somehow.

320
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:13,601
Speaker 1: It probably isn't Like cryptographically secure independent of that client.

321
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,246
Speaker 1: No, I mean sometimes they are.

322
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:25,321
Speaker 1: I've seen API's that are secure in that way, but Yeah, if the API works and you just disabled the GUI Anyone can hit that API and make it do its thing.

323
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:27,770
Speaker 0: So Spotify detected who was doing this.

324
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:37,320
Speaker 0: They saw that like free accounts were skipping songs rapidly or making patterns of API calls that were not API call patterns that you would see from the official Spotify client.

325
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:45,730
Speaker 0: and for those people they sent them a letter saying yo or email Saying hey, we see that you're using a pirated non-official Spotify client there.

326
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:48,378
Speaker 0: We disabled your Spotify account.

327
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,330
Speaker 0: use the real Spotify client again, and we will re-enable you.

328
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:54,719
Speaker 0: I saw this by just paying for Spotify.

329
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, I paid.

330
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:58,534
Speaker 1: I ended up paying for Amazon instead But it's equivalent.

331
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:01,224
Speaker 0: Amazon one does not is good for the.

332
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:02,429
Speaker 0: so here's the thing, right?

333
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:15,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had the Amazon one and Spotify and what I was doing is this uploading music to Amazon because you can't upload music to Spotify really and using Spotify to get new music and thus I would never need to get new mp3s ever.

334
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:18,494
Speaker 0: All right, cuz new music from Spotify I can stream it all.

335
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,426
Speaker 0: my existing library of mp3s from back in the day is 100% on Amazon.

336
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:23,089
Speaker 0: I'm good.

337
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:27,562
Speaker 0: What happened was is I then paid for YouTube red to get rid of ads on YouTube.

338
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:30,410
Speaker 0: YouTube red comes with Google Play music.

339
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:30,954
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

340
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,950
Speaker 1: I forgot it does so YouTube red.

341
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,937
Speaker 1: I just started paying for YouTube red like a week ago.

342
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:39,550
Speaker 0: YouTube red gives you free Google Play music as like if they they're the Same thing basically.

343
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:54,348
Speaker 0: In fact, I heard a Google executive say that they consider YouTube red to be a music service because it also comes with the YouTube Music app that lets you they use YouTube as a Pandora or whatever Like it has the app lets you like watch YouTube and audio only mode anyway.

344
00:22:56,383 --> 00:23:04,390
Speaker 0: But yeah it gets rid of ads on YouTube and The Google Play music also sort of makes the Amazon music redundant because you can upload all your music there.

345
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,870
Speaker 0: So I uploaded all my music to Amazon to Google and then I stopped uploading it to Amazon.

346
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,879
Speaker 0: I stopped paying for that because the Google one.

347
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,446
Speaker 0: that way I'm not paying for three things.

348
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:13,230
Speaker 0: I'm paying for two things.

349
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,150
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz it wasn't gonna stop paying for YouTube YouTube red, right?

350
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:32,468
Speaker 0: So now I use Google Play music Which is free with YouTube red for uploading all my mp3s to the clouds like listen to them anywhere and I use Spotify for streaming Musics because really the music selection on Google Play music of streaming is not the greatest.

351
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:40,250
Speaker 0: However The other scary contender is Apple music which might be a contender for Spotify, right?

352
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:41,840
Speaker 0: There's so much stuff.

353
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,010
Speaker 0: I'm used to on Spotify.

354
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:50,629
Speaker 0: I don't want to give up but the Apple music is actually really good and works with an Apple watch and does fancy stuff and has a great selection.

355
00:23:50,649 --> 00:24:00,670
Speaker 0: and so maybe for the streaming one as I did the free demo of Apple music and I was like Oh not bad, but it couldn't really completely kill Spotify.

356
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,094
Speaker 0: So like stuck with.

357
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:07,250
Speaker 1: now more interesting going down to this layer of there are like you can just do Spotify in a web browser.

358
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:09,006
Speaker 1: Sure, we have an app on a phone.

359
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:13,889
Speaker 1: The more interesting question is around like with the web.

360
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:28,876
Speaker 1: There's this fundamental contract that you could use any web browser to hit any URI and interact with it and it's on the server side to handle any sort of authorizations and Restrictions and walls and whatever.

361
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,324
Speaker 1: so I could use whatever browser I want.

362
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:33,069
Speaker 1: I can use whatever client I want.

363
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:37,210
Speaker 1: Should the similar principle be applied to services like Spotify?

364
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,604
Speaker 0: I mean technologically but also they emailed you and shut your account down.

365
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:46,221
Speaker 1: so she can do about true true But at the same time, uh, well, I mean one.

366
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,670
Speaker 1: they really should secure the API's themselves.

367
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,149
Speaker 0: How do you implement a no skip button API on the service end?

368
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:58,273
Speaker 0: I can think of some ways while still allowing people to say double click on a song to play it if it's you know A completely different song.

369
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:04,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the details of how I would implement that are pretty Too much for this show.

370
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:04,900
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

371
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:06,810
Speaker 0: But the real point is not easy.

372
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:24,230
Speaker 1: Well, it's it's definitely some sort of risk-based security in that the risk of users doing this doesn't cost them much and it's easy for them to take a non technological means to Highlight the people who are causing the problem and force them to start paying or at least enable them to start paying.

373
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:37,110
Speaker 1: but I guess is there a future place for a right to Use your own clients for a service and it's up to the service to provide the API driven rules of engagement.

374
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:44,130
Speaker 1: What's the line between a website and an app and a service and a web and all these things and I have moral problem with it.

375
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,036
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it happens.

376
00:25:45,238 --> 00:25:46,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just think it's interesting.

377
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:54,190
Speaker 1: I'm very interested that there are people who spent the time to figure this out and went so far as to make the pirate clients.

378
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:06,829
Speaker 1: So in some other news there are a bunch of LTE vulnerabilities hitherto unknown to the world that are now Well known to the world as affects everyone with a phone.

379
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:08,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, everybody.

380
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:09,880
Speaker 1: I didn't read into the details.

381
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,910
Speaker 0: But basically Android iPhones y'all got LTE everybody.

382
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:29,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're on an LTE network, I think it says ten attacks were announced by this paper Ranging from things like snooping on text messages tracking individual users locations and more funnily spoofing emergency alerts.

383
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:43,790
Speaker 1: the only hope I have is that If these were that easy to execute people would already be executing the New York City Because that would be the most bang for your buck in terms of like sending a spoofed emergency alert.

384
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:46,309
Speaker 1: And I have not yet seen a spoofed emergency alert.

385
00:26:46,873 --> 00:27:07,717
Speaker 1: But apparently based on what I'm reading in the summary on slash shot The only real barrier to enter it using these is you need to spend a few thousand dollars on a software-defined radio As in a radio device that can be modulated by software purely as opposed to having some sort of hardware Limitation and where it can transmit.

386
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:36,349
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into what that means because it's kind of complicated but we've talked about this on geek nights a long time ago about how a Purely software controlled transmitter is very dangerous to a lot of existing infrastructure because a lot of existing infrastructure in America relies heavily on the fact that consumers cannot get their hands on radios that can transmit certain kinds of information on certain frequency bands and software radios sidestep all of that.

387
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:46,678
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah the real the only thing you can do unless you want to exploit these things is Treat LTL T off on your phone.

388
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm sure 3g is just so secure.

389
00:27:50,972 --> 00:28:07,161
Speaker 1: The only real thing you can do is the thing you should already be doing Treat LTE data transfers like they are a completely open network Mm-hmm, if you're not using TLS on anything that you're sending or receiving then Assume that people are reading it

390
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,630
Speaker 0: get some VPN on your phone.

391
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,683
Speaker 1: You don't use SMS for anything you care about because that's just clear text.

392
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:30,349
Speaker 1: That is like the most trivial exploit and In terms of the location tracking if you actually care about not being tracked because you're doing something shady Put your phone in airplane mode before you do the shady thing Like that, that's all you can do right now.

393
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,169
Speaker 1: Hmm so in some other news, that's actually really good news YouTube.

394
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:45,340
Speaker 0: They made a bunch of changes recently and the ones that changes coincided with the time that they demonetized They because they before remember those in news about him.

395
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,010
Speaker 0: They were gonna demonetize people whose accounts weren't big enough.

396
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:54,028
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, they actually that was just a warning when that news happened that they were telling people they were gonna get demonetized.

397
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:55,554
Speaker 0: now They're demonetized.

398
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:59,790
Speaker 0: Yep, but then they released a bunch of new features to go along with that demonetization.

399
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,398
Speaker 0: I think they were probably all in the same patch maybe or something.

400
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:07,434
Speaker 1: Yeah now, I I'm pretty okay with the scope of the demonetization.

401
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:16,370
Speaker 1: I know that's an unpopular opinion, but the geek nice Channel is way way like my personal YouTube channel way above the minimum.

402
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:17,233
Speaker 0: Mine was not.

403
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:18,980
Speaker 0: I got to monetize which is actually good.

404
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,523
Speaker 0: It's not.

405
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:29,537
Speaker 1: life is a lot easier, but For a channel that is moderately popular and way above the line I'm making under 50 bucks a month.

406
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:35,094
Speaker 0: It's yeah, I mean even people who are big on YouTube don't make good money Unless you're mega big.

407
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:45,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the people my best estimate the people who were below the line were making Maybe a dozen dollars a month tops Reality.

408
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:58,250
Speaker 1: you can't expect a platform like YouTube to subsidize the monetization of very small content because The real problem the real thing they were trying to address is that a lot of small channels not the majority but enough.

409
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:00,849
Speaker 1: We're like right-wing Nazi racist bullshit.

410
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:08,990
Speaker 1: You can't risk ads appearing on that and you can't have humans vent Tens and hundreds of thousands of YouTube channels that have 18 subscribers.

411
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,798
Speaker 1: But anyway the change that's good.

412
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:17,670
Speaker 1: That's really good that no one should disagree with that YouTube added is They've added live captioning.

413
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:27,208
Speaker 1: so a live stream Will have pretty good live closed captions including theoretically this stream.

414
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,136
Speaker 1: right now I'm gonna see if I can watch them.

415
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:32,680
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can watch them on the like Special viewer.

416
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:40,872
Speaker 1: I got here for the live stream but they added it and I looked at our previous two live streams and the captions are Shockingly good.

417
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:51,130
Speaker 1: Mmm, despite the fact that me and Scott talk very fast and talk over each other and use a lot of proper nouns It has that shit down except it seemed to skip every time we said the word fuck.

418
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,950
Speaker 1: It's just skipped right over it reliably.

419
00:30:55,375 --> 00:31:02,461
Speaker 0: Yeah, they added some other features But I forget what they were right now and only one of them other ones besides the captions was interesting But the captions are the biggest one.

420
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:02,864
Speaker 1: Yeah.

421
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:03,710
Speaker 1: No, what's that extra?

422
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:05,434
Speaker 0: Finally, right?

423
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:10,710
Speaker 0: It's like there have been so many things over the years like do you pay for someone to transcribe geek nights?

424
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,850
Speaker 0: You tried many things and there's never been good results.

425
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:15,033
Speaker 1: Well, we really

426
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:30,810
Speaker 0: really wanted to get geek nights into text form so that people who are hard-of-hearing could absorb it and now we finally have a way that is freer and Better than all the previous ways short of paying a zillion dollars or someone actually do it by hand.

427
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:41,549
Speaker 1: Yep now it looks like we still don't have live captions but The other part of this is that the captions that come after the fact because our live streams all have captions like the next day I'd you clicked on them all to check.

428
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:53,010
Speaker 0: They're so good that I don't need to pay anymore because as you might recall not perfect But you know what if you otherwise can't hear they actually some mostly accurately represent what we are saying.

429
00:31:53,351 --> 00:32:02,145
Speaker 1: so one we started crowdsourcing captions and some listeners stepped up and actually like Made captions for some of our lectures and they're really good.

430
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:03,170
Speaker 1: I'm really thankful for that.

431
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:10,390
Speaker 1: I also took a bunch of the patreon money for geek nights and I bought professional captions for several of our videos.

432
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,560
Speaker 1: I know that was many hundreds of dollars each.

433
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,145
Speaker 1: They were really good.

434
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,770
Speaker 1: Their turnaround was really fast.

435
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:22,392
Speaker 1: The YouTube captions are good enough to where I think we're just gonna let those go Mm-hmm.

436
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:34,970
Speaker 1: What is interesting is one of the companies I paid to do this actually like Message me and thanked me for paying them because they said that basically that entire industry is completely disappearing.

437
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,410
Speaker 1: as AI driven captions like YouTube just do it automatically.

438
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:40,834
Speaker 0: I mean, it sounds good.

439
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty okay with that.

440
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,967
Speaker 1: So I feel like the next accessibility frontier for geek nights.

441
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:53,309
Speaker 1: I Might try paying someone to translate one of our popular lectures into Spanish.

442
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,719
Speaker 1: That's something that is that not happening.

443
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,090
Speaker 0: Is that the top language though that we're trying to reach?

444
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:07,607
Speaker 0: I feel like that is the top language that has a Downplay Spanish, but it's just like yeah, we should definitely go for I mean we go to all the languages.

445
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:18,556
Speaker 0: if we could write Look at the the Demographics of people visiting the videos and go in order from top to bottom of the demographics of people visiting the videos is all English-speaking countries.

446
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,164
Speaker 1: I feel like it's a catch-22 there, right?

447
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,782
Speaker 0: But I'm talking like do are we getting a lot of people from like China?

448
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:25,410
Speaker 0: we go Chinese that more, you know.

449
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,596
Speaker 0: So I'll tell you right now most blocked in China, uh, probably We're probably blocked in Thailand too.

450
00:33:31,616 --> 00:33:33,002
Speaker 1: If they ever saw what we said about the king.

451
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:41,104
Speaker 0: Can Hong Kong get to us, you know You know Japan Korea India, you know, there's a lot of countries out there with a lot of languages.

452
00:33:41,585 --> 00:34:03,770
Speaker 1: so in terms of underserved markets in video game designs specifically I feel like there is the biggest interest gap between people who want this content and Not that content not being provided for them in Spanish Partly based on the fact that pillow fight the company that I'm slightly involved with with our friends released a game.

453
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:12,714
Speaker 1: Spanish language was a day one like launch thing and the game is set in like the Cuban community in Florida and There's a big sense.

454
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:17,010
Speaker 1: There is a big response to that because a lot of games don't include Spanish language support.

455
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:17,992
Speaker 1: No There is.

456
00:34:18,152 --> 00:34:22,489
Speaker 1: there are a lot of kids who would probably love to watch a lecture on how to design games in Spanish.

457
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:25,521
Speaker 0: Slay the spire has a lot of languages support.

458
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:27,187
Speaker 0: I just want to say good news.

459
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:27,849
Speaker 1: I still got to play it.

460
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:29,121
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play it this weekend.

461
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:32,860
Speaker 1: I think The other feature they added this that's concurrent to this.

462
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,708
Speaker 1: that's interesting is the live stream.

463
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:37,981
Speaker 1: right now If you're watching this there are people chatting in our live stream.

464
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:40,230
Speaker 1: There's actually 17 people in there right now.

465
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,475
Speaker 0: So say so.

466
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:44,690
Speaker 1: what they're also doing is they're keeping that metadata.

467
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:54,030
Speaker 1: So if you watch one of our live streams of geek nights The chat will update live like it did when the stream itself was live.

468
00:34:54,777 --> 00:35:13,989
Speaker 1: That's a minor thing but that's I think an important thing for the future and for archives because imagine being able to go back to like on Twitch in the future and watch the overwatch championships from a hundred years ago and See the actual chats Instream from a hundred years ago.

469
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:15,877
Speaker 1: That's the kind of cool stuff like.

470
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:16,379
Speaker 1: it's a really.

471
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:25,818
Speaker 1: it's not an important feature that many of you care about now But you're gonna be really thankful for that feature in a decade when you watch some old YouTube video And see these vintage chats.

472
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,770
Speaker 0: Here's a news that's related but rim doesn't have it over there.

473
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what's going down to something going down on Twitch right now, right?

474
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:33,347
Speaker 0: There's this guy.

475
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,170
Speaker 0: I don't know his name.

476
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,347
Speaker 0: I forgot his name because I don't the article up and he has streaming fortnight.

477
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:42,870
Speaker 0: He's a used to Used to be a big halo eSports champion.

478
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,045
Speaker 0: But now he's streaming fortnight and he has a zillion subscribers and he's gonna make.

479
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:52,907
Speaker 0: he stands to make like 250 K I think and subscriber monies this month is the disrespect guy.

480
00:35:52,928 --> 00:36:03,002
Speaker 0: No This is actually an okay guy, okay As far as I know he's an okay guy But what's happening is people are suspecting that what's?

481
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:09,129
Speaker 0: he doesn't actually have that many legitimate Subscribers even though he didn't necessarily as far as we know do anything awful.

482
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,477
Speaker 0: Apparently this is the story.

483
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,543
Speaker 0: that is probably what's going on.

484
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:22,284
Speaker 0: So if you have a twitch prime account Amazon Prime plus twitch You get some fortnight skins and stuff as like a gift.

485
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:23,770
Speaker 0: Oh right now.

486
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:37,342
Speaker 0: So people on eBay and such are buying and selling Amazon, you know credentials to people with prime that have not, you know Cuz a lot of people get Amazon Prime that are not using twitch, right?

487
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:55,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you get their credentials Link up get a twitch prime you can get those skins Right and you can just load up on skins and all kinds of stuff for fortnight if you can manage to get lots of Amazon Prime accounts, so And you know, it's not like kids who play fortnight have Amazon Prime,

488
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,948
Speaker 1: I think there's an article on Newsweek about this

489
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:04,924
Speaker 0: maybe but apparently what's happening is those accounts that are like bought and sold of twitch.

490
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:11,036
Speaker 0: a twitch prime account comes with a Once a month free Subscription to any twitch channel.

491
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:15,548
Speaker 1: So every month I go and subscribe all these channels subscribing to this one person.

492
00:37:15,688 --> 00:37:20,370
Speaker 0: every month I go and subscribe to the twitch channel of my choosing and I lose nothing.

493
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:29,746
Speaker 0: I just click on a twitch channel and that person gets two dollars and fifty cents and and twitch gets two dollars and fifty cents from Amazon, which is their own money, I guess.

494
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:32,933
Speaker 0: but Yeah, it's like.

495
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:34,437
Speaker 0: all I had to do is click and I can.

496
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:40,738
Speaker 0: I can give two dollars fifty cents to one twitch channel per Every month like an AGD Q months.

497
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:41,160
Speaker 0: I'll choose.

498
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,244
Speaker 0: that's like two months out of the year.

499
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:43,890
Speaker 0: I'll choose them other months.

500
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,048
Speaker 0: I'll choose whoever I'm watching the most or someone I know or ever right.

501
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:55,969
Speaker 0: But yeah, these peep these bots or whatever that are like loading up on fortnight skins It's like well, they got free subs attached to them.

502
00:37:56,251 --> 00:38:01,450
Speaker 0: They're all subbing to like this dude and also other people and they can see like a flood.

503
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:08,361
Speaker 0: This guy can see like a huge flood of subscriptions coming in like hundreds and hundreds at a time because you know He's got the auto notifiers.

504
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:09,350
Speaker 0: He can respond and thank.

505
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,258
Speaker 0: Striving it's like doesn't be a flood of them.

506
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:13,061
Speaker 0: Like oh my god.

507
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:14,608
Speaker 0: It's got a thousand descriptions all at once.

508
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:15,010
Speaker 0: What the hell?

509
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:17,880
Speaker 0: Right and now he's still.

510
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,917
Speaker 0: if that happens to him he stands to gain $2.50 for each one of those.

511
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:28,449
Speaker 0: but this twitch prime fortnight promotion stands to end soon at like in a month or so.

512
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:49,990
Speaker 0: People are suspecting that the end of the month this guy and others who are also been Unvictimized by this Stand to lose a shit ton of subscribers and all those Amazon prime things just stop Right because they're subscribed for one month and when the month ends like this subscriber count supposedly would just drop like a rock.

513
00:38:50,472 --> 00:38:52,320
Speaker 0: So this is really really interesting.

514
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,087
Speaker 0: We'll see if they actually get paid out or not.

515
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:54,911
Speaker 1: Well, yeah you.

516
00:38:55,674 --> 00:39:17,430
Speaker 1: the fundamental question here from a technology standpoint is that Whenever you set up a system where one party at no cost to them Can give a boom that has some monetary value to an unrelated account or person There will be massive immediate programmatic exploitation of that vacuum.

517
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:23,394
Speaker 1: it's like gifting arbitrage and I don't know.

518
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:31,490
Speaker 1: I feel like that has to have been baked Like people who designed these systems had to have assumed this would happen on purpose hoping that it would drive subscriptions.

519
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:36,049
Speaker 1: I can't believe anyone beat would be so naive as to not expect this kind of thing.

520
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy looked up the guy.

521
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:38,384
Speaker 0: the guy's name is ninja.

522
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found him.

523
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:44,710
Speaker 1: The problem is there's this like piece of shit streamer who's in all the news for being racist?

524
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:47,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if the if the ninja guy is a good guy.

525
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,129
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about this guy, but he's just in the headline for this larger story.

526
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:53,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, ninja kept popping up.

527
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:55,218
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Okay.

528
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:56,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the guy.

529
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,434
Speaker 1: anyway I'm organizing our news.

530
00:39:59,454 --> 00:40:03,430
Speaker 1: So next news you might have noticed there was a Twitter bot purge.

531
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:17,721
Speaker 1: so Twitter has a problem in that basically there are Thousands and thousands and thousands of what are literally Russian like psyops bot accounts tweeting Nonsense to try to destabilize the American democracy like this.

532
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,469
Speaker 1: We know that's not even under dispute.

533
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:21,494
Speaker 0: Also other democracy.

534
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:28,109
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but other democracies too, but I'm focusing on the one that the one that's really affecting my day-to-day life right now.

535
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,558
Speaker 1: but This is not a new problem.

536
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:39,121
Speaker 1: We've known for a long time that there are a lot of Bot accounts on Twitter and that it's a big problem.

537
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,429
Speaker 0: I wonder if Russians are sending those all caps emails to do.

538
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:45,150
Speaker 1: I would not be surprised at all.

539
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:52,052
Speaker 1: So the deal is Twitter refuses to do anything reasonable about this and I think my the main reason for that This is not.

540
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:53,216
Speaker 1: this is pure speculation.

541
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,664
Speaker 0: There are then no numbers of how many accounts there.

542
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:56,507
Speaker 0: I will go way down.

543
00:40:56,527 --> 00:41:04,330
Speaker 1: I suspect in my Personal opinion that a huge percentage of all the traffic on Twitter is bots.

544
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,386
Speaker 1: Bots tweeting at bots.

545
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:11,824
Speaker 1: Yep So the well, but then the side problem is that out of this bot churn.

546
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:19,890
Speaker 1: There's a surprising number of Humans who I think the way I want to describe this is the in ten years ago.

547
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:20,496
Speaker 1: I would say.

548
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:24,622
Speaker 1: the problem is you know We like there are things that don't pass the Turing test like.

549
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,430
Speaker 1: will this system pass the Turing test today?

550
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,023
Speaker 1: There are people who fail to administer the Turing test.

551
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:31,950
Speaker 1: It's like its own reverse Turing test.

552
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,670
Speaker 1: There are human beings who look at one of these like Russian bot accounts and think it's a legitimate person.

553
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,917
Speaker 0: People have always fallen.

554
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:41,350
Speaker 0: they see a website and they think that's a real download link.

555
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, people can't tell real from fake.

556
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,063
Speaker 0: They don't have that skill.

557
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:46,810
Speaker 0: It's very dangerous in a world.

558
00:41:47,111 --> 00:41:48,679
Speaker 0: So we're in a world of deadly poison.

559
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,045
Speaker 0: It's it's like here.

560
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:51,030
Speaker 0: I've got a better example.

561
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,670
Speaker 0: Yeah in a in a field of mushrooms You better know which ones are poisoning which ones aren't right?

562
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,065
Speaker 0: We walk around and take for granted that we can just tell by looking at it.

563
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,073
Speaker 1: No, sir I walk around.

564
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:05,850
Speaker 1: I assume that everything I ever see on the internet is both malware and a lie.

565
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:12,230
Speaker 0: Right, but the point is we can walk around the mushroom field That is the internet and without been eat tons of mushrooms without ever getting poisoned.

566
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:14,920
Speaker 0: most people just get poisoned immediately and die but it just.

567
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:19,942
Speaker 1: it amazes me that like you me or Emily will like Look at a website and be like that is obviously a scam.

568
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:30,150
Speaker 1: and then there will be a person another human being who is Ostensibly as intelligent in us will look at the exact same website and say looks legit and put their credit card number in.

569
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,856
Speaker 0: They were not cooked in the fire.

570
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:32,237
Speaker 0: We have it.

571
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:37,576
Speaker 0: We have a great privilege of having been cooked in internet fires so most people do not have

572
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:55,885
Speaker 1: what Twitter did is they purged a huge number of like specifically identified bot accounts And what was interesting about this is that there was a huge outcry From Twitter users over the loss of all these legitimate people.

573
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:57,210
Speaker 0: Are you sure there weren't bots?

574
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:59,424
Speaker 0: So, here's what happened.

575
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:00,310
Speaker 0: the complaining also.

576
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:10,378
Speaker 1: I'm gonna summarize what happened where the bots also the ones complaining about the legitimate users the people who were complaining were Far-right supremacist like white supremacist.

577
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:14,349
Speaker 0: Are you sure they were just also bots that are right supremacist bots.

578
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,369
Speaker 1: now We're pretty sure there's a lot of people who are actually known people.

579
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:35,840
Speaker 1: Okay It seems like what happened is the real Nazis and the real Republicans noticed overnight that they lost Thousands and thousands and thousands of followers Because big percentage of their followers were these Russian bots Mm-hmm, and that is the outcry.

580
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,750
Speaker 1: if you see any news about people like talking about this Twitter purge.

581
00:43:40,051 --> 00:44:06,074
Speaker 1: Every one of these accounts with few exceptions was a known bot account and now there's an outcry by people who are mad that these bot accounts are gone, but those people pretty much are almost exclusively far-right wing people and While these bots were also trying to target left-wing politics, it seems like on average people who are more liberal either didn't notice subscriber drops or Realized.

582
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:08,030
Speaker 1: they were bots and did not thus complain.

583
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:14,690
Speaker 1: The real problem is that these bot accounts are still ubiquitous not just on Twitter, but all across social media.

584
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:20,630
Speaker 1: It is obvious which ones are bots and yet very few entities are choosing to do anything about it.

585
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:29,840
Speaker 1: And I feel like the Underlying story is that this kind of information warfare is real is dangerous and the u.s In particular is doing almost nothing to combat it.

586
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:30,926
Speaker 0: I got a good solution.

587
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:34,630
Speaker 0: Here's how it works All right, everyone's Twitter account is temporarily suspended.

588
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:43,402
Speaker 0: All right everyone who comes and pays a visit to judge Scott and gets judged by judge Scott to be Having a Twitter account as their account reinstated the end.

589
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:45,309
Speaker 0: Yeah problem solved get out.

590
00:44:46,494 --> 00:44:53,450
Speaker 1: I feel like spy agencies need to hire the kinds of people who aren't tricked by phishing And just use them to solve a lot of these problems.

591
00:44:55,433 --> 00:45:07,714
Speaker 1: So in some other news, uh This particular news is not a danger to you because there's no way it'll come to pass but this is the kind of thing that comes up perennially and Generate.

592
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:11,335
Speaker 0: I usually hear this kind of news in the UK Yeah But it happened in the u.s.

593
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:12,619
Speaker 1: In Rhode Island of all things.

594
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:19,942
Speaker 1: basically Democrats in Rhode Island put forth a bill Now before you think that what I'm about to say is crazy or novel.

595
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:29,810
Speaker 1: bills like this have been coming up in American state-level politics since I was in middle school and we would like organize around writing campaigns to stop them.

596
00:45:30,313 --> 00:45:32,069
Speaker 1: But the gist is Rhode Island.

597
00:45:32,756 --> 00:45:44,130
Speaker 1: These the Democrats here But it is a bipartisan bill as far as I can tell want to force all ISPs that provide internet in the state to block Sexual content and offensive material.

598
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:51,251
Speaker 1: So Wikipedia and then anyone who wants to access that material can pay a fee of $20.

599
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,094
Speaker 0: Where does that money go?

600
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:52,656
Speaker 0: the state.

601
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:55,970
Speaker 1: that money goes to a state slush fund that I guess will be used.

602
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:56,754
Speaker 0: They're trying to fight.

603
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:59,909
Speaker 0: They're trying to make porn human trafficking or something trying to make a porn tax.

604
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,853
Speaker 1: basically There is.

605
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:05,887
Speaker 1: so there is no way this would pass musters.

606
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:10,790
Speaker 0: the Supreme Court Even the current right people always talk about freedom of speech with like Twitter blocks them.

607
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:11,673
Speaker 0: But it's like that's not.

608
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:14,863
Speaker 0: government says the show that this is government station is go.

609
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:16,088
Speaker 0: This is the First Amendment.

610
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:20,056
Speaker 0: this one First amendment, this is it.

611
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:20,779
Speaker 0: Here it is.

612
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, Italy you found here's used to go attack this.

613
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:24,810
Speaker 0: We don't love porn.

614
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:31,630
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing that you don't even really need to fight because we these are the fights that we win by default.

615
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:39,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I am not afraid that this is going to become law and even with the conservative leading Supreme Court of the United States I'm pretty confident.

616
00:46:39,354 --> 00:46:42,863
Speaker 1: This would not pass even the most minimal muster.

617
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,410
Speaker 0: No, this is this is not going anywhere.

618
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,077
Speaker 0: But yeah, but here you go.

619
00:46:47,117 --> 00:46:49,125
Speaker 0: Here's your here's your First Amendment battle.

620
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:49,988
Speaker 0: That's actually happening.

621
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:53,660
Speaker 1: Yep So here's a kind of interesting story.

622
00:46:53,941 --> 00:47:10,141
Speaker 1: The headline was oh, this story is huge this one 23,000 complicated HTTPS so TLS certificates X Meaning like destroyed shut down revoked or whatever After the CEO emails the private keys to someone.

623
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:12,246
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's so much going on.

624
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:13,530
Speaker 0: There's so much going on here.

625
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:23,102
Speaker 0: I've tried to read it and like figure it all out and here's probably I'm gonna just say right out probably incorrect But this is what I've gathered so far.

626
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:26,055
Speaker 0: There was a company called Semantic, right?

627
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:26,797
Speaker 0: It's semantic.

628
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:27,619
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

629
00:47:27,759 --> 00:47:31,390
Speaker 0: Okay, and they were issuing certificates to people.

630
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:35,815
Speaker 0: They did a really shitty fucking job Really shitty fucking job.

631
00:47:36,497 --> 00:47:40,467
Speaker 0: another company digi cert who also was in the certificate business, right?

632
00:47:41,129 --> 00:47:46,315
Speaker 0: But semantic There was another company Called.

633
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:47,803
Speaker 0: what's the third company called?

634
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,878
Speaker 1: Uh So we got.

635
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:50,323
Speaker 1: did you serve.

636
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:51,050
Speaker 1: we got semantic?

637
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:52,492
Speaker 0: What's the other god?

638
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:53,115
Speaker 1: I'm looking for it.

639
00:47:53,216 --> 00:47:54,702
Speaker 1: trust to co-trust to coach.

640
00:47:54,722 --> 00:47:55,706
Speaker 1: I've never heard of before.

641
00:47:55,767 --> 00:48:04,253
Speaker 0: but yeah Trustico was also issued certificates, but at one time issued certificates on behalf of Semantic, right?

642
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:06,780
Speaker 0: So it's like they were issuing semantic certs to people.

643
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,330
Speaker 0: right, but they're not now they're now they're just doing their own certificates.

644
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:13,538
Speaker 0: yeah, the Digi cert bought up semantic.

645
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,287
Speaker 0: the people at trust to co Contacted digicer and were like, hey Semantic was that we're doing a really shitty job.

646
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:25,376
Speaker 0: a lot of their certificates are compromised.

647
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:26,740
Speaker 0: Please revoke them.

648
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:28,193
Speaker 0: Yep, did you sir?

649
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:28,738
Speaker 0: It was like.

650
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:42,704
Speaker 0: No, we're not going to revoke those certs, right because what basically would happen is those people instead of just you know Renewing their certs when the time came and giving more money to digicer wouldn't maybe you know Perhaps by.

651
00:48:42,764 --> 00:48:44,375
Speaker 0: I don't know why but they didn't do it.

652
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:50,460
Speaker 0: Yep, so The CEO of trust to co took the private keys.

653
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:58,249
Speaker 0: I don't know if these are the private keys on their side or the private keys on the client side But yeah, and also closure as much as we both know about TLS.

654
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:03,647
Speaker 0: I still have to like I don't know but he emailed private keys to.

655
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:05,425
Speaker 0: Did you sir?

656
00:49:05,827 --> 00:49:08,517
Speaker 0: Which means well, we got to revoke these fucking things now.

657
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:14,796
Speaker 0: Yeah But why did trust to go have private keys, they're not supposed to have those.

658
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:15,940
Speaker 0: how did they even get them?

659
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,039
Speaker 0: I don't understand what the fuck is going on.

660
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,306
Speaker 1: Here's an analogy that's simpler.

661
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:24,357
Speaker 1: Let's say you lost your password to some like bullshitting website.

662
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:25,420
Speaker 0: Let's say you call the locksmith.

663
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,389
Speaker 0: Why did the locksmith keep a key to your fucking house?

664
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:34,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, or very specific this happens Have you ever tried to reset your password on a website and they send you your password in?

665
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:39,362
Speaker 1: If they usually they'll say all right set a new password Cuz.

666
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:41,489
Speaker 1: yeah, we can't give you your old password.

667
00:49:42,091 --> 00:49:47,327
Speaker 1: if they if they can give you your old password Their system is way insecure and awful.

668
00:49:47,347 --> 00:49:48,391
Speaker 1: They have just told you.

669
00:49:48,712 --> 00:49:52,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, we are the worst and everything Forever.

670
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,060
Speaker 1: do not trust us, right?

671
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,964
Speaker 0: So here's the thing.

672
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:55,889
Speaker 0: is that you know the whole.

673
00:49:55,949 --> 00:50:04,466
Speaker 0: the reason that when you get an SSL cert You need to go to one of these companies to basically prove who you are because not only does it encrypt It was just encryption.

674
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,880
Speaker 0: We can all just make our own keys and not even give a shit.

675
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,230
Speaker 1: I can self sign a certificate right now, right?

676
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:21,678
Speaker 0: The reason we have these other these authorities that sign certs is because we want to make sure that whoever has the certificate for your bank comm is actually somebody from your bank comm.

677
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:30,839
Speaker 0: otherwise Scott can go make a website your bank comm and make the little green thing light up saying yeah This is totally your bank comm lol.

678
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:44,844
Speaker 0: Whereas right now is if I was to hack your DNS and make you go to Scott server instead of your bank comm server I can't do anything and it's gonna have a red lock up there and you're gonna know hey, this is a fake my bank Comm.

679
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:47,200
Speaker 0: you're not fooling me and to log it in right?

680
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:49,740
Speaker 0: So that's why you need these third-party companies.

681
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:58,129
Speaker 0: But if these third-party companies are not trustworthy and start issuing certs to everybody and their mother This is how we get problems.

682
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,800
Speaker 0: and here we have an example of that problem actually happening.

683
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:02,688
Speaker 0: It's not just a hypothetical thing.

684
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,495
Speaker 1: It happened and part of this is there's.

685
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:07,908
Speaker 0: there's a lot of 23,000 websites compromised.

686
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:10,337
Speaker 1: there are a lot of like competing interests here.

687
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:17,440
Speaker 1: on one hand Setting up TLS certs with like a real chain of trust is a giant pain in the ass.

688
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:23,820
Speaker 1: Yep, that causes a lot of friction and like beardos will complain Look, oh, I don't want to have to get permission from someone.

689
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:25,684
Speaker 0: Let's encrypt it.

690
00:51:25,704 --> 00:51:26,729
Speaker 0: lets you do it way easy.

691
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:28,840
Speaker 0: We're using it for our forum and it works great.

692
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,945
Speaker 0: It's just not you know, it's just clear that this is not Maximum trust.

693
00:51:33,005 --> 00:51:36,920
Speaker 1: like if I went to my bank and my bank had a lesson let's encrypt.

694
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:39,356
Speaker 1: I'd be a little dubious of that because let's encrypt.

695
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:43,140
Speaker 1: as a company I don't necessarily know how well they vet the use of certificates.

696
00:51:43,803 --> 00:52:02,876
Speaker 1: Like for example, if my bank has their certificate with their private key However, they've set it up If the private key is compromised such that some nefarious actor or some disgruntled employee from the issuing authority Could like sign another certificate that was just as valid then the bank is hosed and people can steal all my biz.

697
00:52:03,077 --> 00:52:20,780
Speaker 1: Yep, so adding friction to the process by making people prove who they are and having Costs and fees in the transactions to prevent sort of like spam attacks on these systems You'll notice that some websites in the corner of the browser appear more secure than others.

698
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:31,980
Speaker 0: They have like, you know, even more green shit up there usually Ten pictures of locks and a picture of a vault and a picture of a security officer and the word secure in green letters.

699
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, all that shit means they paid more money and they went through more hassle to prove how how good they are.

700
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,820
Speaker 1: Yep, it is it is a hassle.

701
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:52,918
Speaker 1: so there's these all these competing interests, but the reality is that the trust infrastructure of the internet is still run pretty much exclusively by private companies who have a lot of deep failings.

702
00:52:52,938 --> 00:52:59,719
Speaker 1: and When there's a problem like digit search doing a pretty good job as far as I can see like companies can fix it.

703
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:02,220
Speaker 1: But you have to be able to revoke certificates.

704
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:06,617
Speaker 1: But people are very leery of revoking certificates because that breaks things on the enemy.

705
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:15,064
Speaker 0: if they had revoked him That means 23,000 websites that were green would suddenly be red and all those customers would start complaining like what the fuck Everyone.

706
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:16,248
Speaker 0: it's like recalling a product.

707
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,939
Speaker 0: only the pain in the ass is harder than just buying something.

708
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like shipping something back and getting a like a new.

709
00:53:23,212 --> 00:53:25,300
Speaker 0: like I've had my fire extinguisher recalled like twice.

710
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:27,639
Speaker 0: It was really easy to get a new one or mail back the old one.

711
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,755
Speaker 0: It'd be a lot harder to go redo all my SSL bullshit.

712
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:42,139
Speaker 1: That's not what I do and imagine if you run like a giant website with like load balancers, which The interaction between TLS and load balancers is something that particularly pains me.

713
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:44,524
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

714
00:53:44,544 --> 00:53:45,950
Speaker 1: So anyway, this is all time.

715
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,793
Speaker 0: Have we gone through here?

716
00:53:47,114 --> 00:53:48,440
Speaker 1: Oh, we can wrap this up pretty soon.

717
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,624
Speaker 1: Let's go through a few of the rest.

718
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:57,248
Speaker 1: So brief news in case you you know, you probably assume this is true But this is the evidence that it is true.

719
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:00,537
Speaker 1: PC sales are dropping like 2.7% year-over-year.

720
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:06,960
Speaker 0: I think most people, you know use their phone their tablet and their smart TV or whatever.

721
00:54:07,502 --> 00:54:12,280
Speaker 0: Pretty much does everything that they do if they're not creating content or playing PC games.

722
00:54:13,186 --> 00:54:14,395
Speaker 1: So that's not.

723
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:15,140
Speaker 1: PCs are dead.

724
00:54:15,742 --> 00:54:26,905
Speaker 0: Expert people who are just consumers of content that are not high-end, you know GPU needing video games that can't be played on consoles are Not buying desktop PCs.

725
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:29,012
Speaker 0: They're getting rid of the one they got and that's it.

726
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:35,956
Speaker 1: and even more people who need a real Quinn quotes computer more and more are just buying a laptop, right?

727
00:54:36,518 --> 00:54:37,704
Speaker 0: or you know A lot of people.

728
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,273
Speaker 0: Nintendo switch is real popular.

729
00:54:39,293 --> 00:54:40,500
Speaker 0: ps4 is pretty popular.

730
00:54:40,802 --> 00:54:42,820
Speaker 0: It's like and roku boxes.

731
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:47,388
Speaker 0: I've tweeted the other week like hey Maybe the GPU shortage is really just like.

732
00:54:47,508 --> 00:54:49,254
Speaker 0: maybe Nintendo is Satoshi.

733
00:54:49,294 --> 00:54:53,810
Speaker 0: and they mean they started the coin Because they knew this would happen in a long game.

734
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,496
Speaker 0: and now people are buying consoles.

735
00:54:55,536 --> 00:54:58,158
Speaker 0: cuz well get a GPU So I need to play some games.

736
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:06,420
Speaker 1: But yeah I feel like the future of desktop PCs which we've predicted before is going to be just the old definition of the word workstation.

737
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:08,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are workstations.

738
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,180
Speaker 1: They are specialized tools elegant weapons from a more civilized age and you're only gonna have one.

739
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,540
Speaker 0: They're gonna be used for people who need to make things like programming or digital art use some Adobe Photoshop for real or play games.

740
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:23,744
Speaker 1: Yep, that are not.

741
00:55:23,764 --> 00:55:27,720
Speaker 1: that the people who want to play PC games is the thing as opposed to console game.

742
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:41,120
Speaker 0: My only concern is that if you grow up with a tablet or iPhone and you know The reason I am a creator of digital things is because I grew up Using a desktop PC and learned how to program and all that stuff with it.

743
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:46,060
Speaker 0: If you don't grow up with a dangerous weapon, then when are you gonna learn to use the dangerous weapon?

744
00:55:46,841 --> 00:55:50,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, are we people just like when all the people right now who Photoshop things are dead?

745
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:53,000
Speaker 0: Is anyone else gonna learn Photoshop?

746
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,600
Speaker 1: So enter I've been interacting just through like co-workers and people I know With like kids are in the single-digit ages right now.

747
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:07,660
Speaker 1: I do not know what generation they are But they are so alien to Millennials and Generation X that they're like a different race of beings.

748
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:13,826
Speaker 1: nine year olds today on YouTube are Shockingly sophisticated at YouTube.

749
00:56:14,147 --> 00:56:17,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how are they at, you know, Brighton and see?

750
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:21,535
Speaker 1: but so One I think what is going to keep?

751
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:30,809
Speaker 1: because I think Desktop PCs will continue to serve the things that I care about for the rest of my life and the reason for that is that PC gaming is actually growing and While it's not it

752
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,090
Speaker 0: is

753
00:56:31,372 --> 00:56:37,031
Speaker 1: well, it is not completely Filling the gap Like muggles using desktops.

754
00:56:37,714 --> 00:56:45,260
Speaker 1: It's definitely growing Meaning that the PC market will shift more toward that specialized market meaning PCs will be more like the things that I want.

755
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:58,368
Speaker 1: but to the other thing that's driving PC usage other than like companies still and like corporate use is kids doing Media Production mostly around live stream.

756
00:56:58,408 --> 00:56:59,070
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

757
00:56:59,110 --> 00:56:59,932
Speaker 0: is you gotta you know?

758
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:02,560
Speaker 0: people who are you know are doing production are getting them?

759
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,643
Speaker 0: But what about other people?

760
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:06,511
Speaker 1: but that's it that the kids like everyone.

761
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:07,634
Speaker 0: everyone's producing stuff.

762
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:08,677
Speaker 0: Everyone's making videos.

763
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:12,580
Speaker 0: Everyone needs this dude I think the most people making videos on their phones and shit.

764
00:57:13,284 --> 00:57:15,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as soon as they get as soon as they get that taste.

765
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:23,199
Speaker 1: I've seen this progression of y'all like six seven eight year old small sample size But they get a taste of it from their phone.

766
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:36,184
Speaker 1: Then they want to make a real live stream and as soon as they need to stream the video game They're playing they need a computer and OBS and all this shit and they are figuring it out on their own The same way we did.

767
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:46,460
Speaker 1: Mmm, so that that generation I think is gonna fill in the gap and keep a healthy Workstation ecosystem but non workstation PC use I think is going to literally disappear.

768
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:52,894
Speaker 1: So This is just a nice interesting brief set flash if we're trying to get rid of it.

769
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:54,420
Speaker 0: didn't flash die a while ago?

770
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, but doesn't crunchyroll still use it?

771
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,784
Speaker 0: Barely, I don't know.

772
00:57:57,824 --> 00:58:00,439
Speaker 1: I periodically have to do some bullshit to make crunchyroll work.

773
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:01,565
Speaker 0: I don't notice.

774
00:58:01,605 --> 00:58:05,040
Speaker 0: because like all the browsers now they like include like a flash thing.

775
00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:07,159
Speaker 0: So you don't need to go to adobe.com and get it.

776
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:13,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, just sort of you open up Chrome and you go to a website and it just works and it's like, okay so so a car?

777
00:58:13,372 --> 00:58:23,960
Speaker 1: apparently in 20 early 2018 Only 8% of Chrome browsers Yeah hit a flash site on a daily basis, right?

778
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,612
Speaker 0: Cuz me once iOS decided we're not having flash.

779
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,220
Speaker 0: then all the websites removed flash.

780
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:29,589
Speaker 0: So now no one get.

781
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,798
Speaker 0: you know, there's not a lot of flash left.

782
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:39,200
Speaker 1: So HTML 5 video killed off a lot of flash to the only website I still go to that has flash seems to be crunchyroll.

783
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:48,758
Speaker 1: They'd better remove it because it's gonna be disabled by default in July of 2019 in Chrome And it's going to be removed completely in December of 2020 from Chrome.

784
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,996
Speaker 1: sounds good But I think that's only sorry.

785
00:58:51,016 --> 00:58:51,279
Speaker 1: I left.

786
00:58:51,942 --> 00:59:06,000
Speaker 0: I'm worried it to the thing that the only sad thing about the removal of flash is that we've got like 10 plus years worth maybe in 20 years worth of flash games and You might think of flash games like tiny crappy games.

787
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,580
Speaker 0: But it's like there's like a lot of worthwhile art that was created in flash.

788
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:13,780
Speaker 0: That is has value and it will not be accessible.

789
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,680
Speaker 0: They might like how many games are on congregate or like yeah, even before like homestay original homestar runner.

790
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:27,243
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, even though you don't want flash in our browsers, you know for actual everyday doing stuff Flash emulator.

791
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:28,688
Speaker 0: we need to preserve.

792
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:37,512
Speaker 0: the content that happened to sadly be created in flash is Very very valuable to the history of the internet and the human race.

793
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:40,420
Speaker 0: What is interesting our Western civilization?

794
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,965
Speaker 1: What is very interesting?

795
00:59:42,005 --> 00:59:46,506
Speaker 1: Remember when we mentioned is that we were talking about name that beard because that Ross for teens that's flash.

796
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:48,138
Speaker 0: gotta preserve that beard.

797
00:59:48,158 --> 00:59:56,720
Speaker 1: a Huge number of old flash games and old flash content are actually archived to some degree on YouTube.

798
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:59,453
Speaker 0: Right, but you can't archive say homestar runner on YouTube.

799
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:00,800
Speaker 0: It's an interactive experience.

800
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:07,341
Speaker 0: You'd have to like make a exe that is homestar runner dot exe that has the whole site and like that changed over time Too.

801
01:00:07,361 --> 01:00:10,936
Speaker 0: so you'd have to have like an exe that like lets you choose your date and time of like.

802
01:00:10,976 --> 01:00:11,840
Speaker 0: which version of the?

803
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,026
Speaker 1: Well, that is true.

804
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:15,580
Speaker 0: I don't even know if all of that was preserved by the brothers.

805
01:00:17,103 --> 01:00:20,633
Speaker 1: That's just one website But a pale imitation of a lot of those things like.

806
01:00:21,136 --> 01:00:21,860
Speaker 0: what about that game?

807
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,390
Speaker 0: We're like the dinosaur runs to the right and his lava come.

808
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:36,290
Speaker 1: even if some of those games are not playable in the near future in the very least there are plenty of people who are going like Because there's so much pressure to have a unique and novel live stream.

809
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:44,880
Speaker 1: a lot of yet live streamers are finding ancient flash games Playing them and live streaming them and those videos while they are not the complete experience.

810
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:48,020
Speaker 1: You can at least watch someone play that game and I found a live stream.

811
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:53,296
Speaker 1: That is literally someone just playing the entirety of name that beard.

812
01:00:53,637 --> 01:00:56,629
Speaker 1: Yeah in a browser They just live streamed it.

813
01:00:56,911 --> 01:01:02,580
Speaker 0: Yep, if you want to stream flash games Noble endeavor, but it is not as good as actually having the flash games.

814
01:01:03,082 --> 01:01:07,117
Speaker 1: And with that I think we have concluded our spring 2018 tech news around.

815
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:07,800
