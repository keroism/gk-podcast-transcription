1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,720
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, I'm Luke and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
Speaker 0: Tonight I talk about the German competitive puzzle games called Ricochet Robots and Set.

3
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,800
Speaker 0: This is a special episode of Geek Nights while Wim and Scott are away.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,839
Speaker 0: They said, "Hey, send in some of your guest podcasts," and so I thought I might as well make one.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
Speaker 0: They're actually away doing, I guess, anime conventions and video conventions and board game conventions.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Speaker 0: So if you're listening to this Geek Nights for the first time, maybe you met them at a convention or saw them on a panel or something like that and they said, "Check out our podcast,".

7
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:39,199
Speaker 0: and so you're checking it out.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:50,440
Speaker 0: But this is not the best introduction to Geek Nights Tuesdays, so instead what you should do is stop this episode, download pretty much any other episode in the feed as long as it doesn't have the word "special" in the title.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,980
Speaker 0: Just find something that you're interested in, listen to Wim and Scott talk about it in the normal podcast and you get a much better idea of what Geek Nights is really all about.

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,500
Speaker 0: Also in this podcast, I'm not going to stick with the usual format, I'm going to skip the news and the things of the day because I don't know when this episode is going to be released.

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,919
Speaker 0: So the news will be old news and maybe the things of the day will be like everyone had seen it by the time I finished with that.

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,960
Speaker 0: So I'm going to move straight on with the main meat of the matter.

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,058
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way, I'm Luke.

14
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:16,100
Speaker 0: I'm a podcaster.

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,279
Speaker 0: I'm also a professional juggler.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,518
Speaker 0: One of my podcasts is actually called The Juggling Podcast, which you probably won't be interested in.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,360
Speaker 0: Another one is called the Science Fiction Book Review Podcast, where I review science fiction books.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,540
Speaker 0: All of the science fiction books that I read, I review, so check that out if you want.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,820
Speaker 0: More importantly, a bit more about me, I live in Germany and I like German board games, which is actually, you know, put those two facts together, is actually really quite handy because I have access to lots of German board games and I have access to many German people who also like to play board games.

20
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,700
Speaker 0: Many of my friends are much, much, much, much more into board games than I am, but then I have a life as well.

21
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,339
Speaker 0: I can't spend all of it playing board games, although me and my girlfriend, we do spend a lot of time.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,540
Speaker 0: We just got turn and taxes a few weeks ago and had a lot of fun with that.

23
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:15,500
Speaker 0: And also, yeah, we go away because, you know, a lot of my friends, they go away for a few times a year, sort of rent a venue, maybe a school or something where they can sleep and feed themselves and have like a mini board game convention for three or four days, maybe 50 people there or something like that.

24
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,460
Speaker 0: I've done that a few times as well, both here in Germany and in the UK, and it's really good fun, of course.

25
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,815
Speaker 0: Also on top of that, because I'm a juggler, I go to juggling conventions and the games that I'm going to discuss today are ones that we don't play, like.

26
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:45,080
Speaker 0: this is not going to be one of the classics like Settlers and Carcassonne, they're going to be games that I don't play with other gamers, more other jugglers, because every time you go to a juggling convention, there'll be two games, two games specifically that people play most often, and they are ricochet robots and set.

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,780
Speaker 0: They're by far the most popular, and I think they're the most popular because, well, they've got a few things in common.

28
00:02:50,900 --> 00:03:01,580
Speaker 0: First of all, it's a puzzle game, so, you know, when you get good at it, of course you get better at it, and there's nothing random about them, or there is actually randomness in both games, because it sort of sets up a random puzzle, and you've got to solve them.

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,719
Speaker 0: Both of these games, ricochet robots and set, do this.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:12,959
Speaker 0: But for all the players involved, you know, everyone, once they look at the board or look at the cards, equal setup, you know, and then it's the difference in skill that get it, which I really like about that.

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,820
Speaker 0: Too much randomness of drawing cards and rolling dice is never that cool.

32
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,659
Speaker 0: The next thing that they've both got in common is that you don't have to have a set number of players to play it with.

33
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,880
Speaker 0: So you can play with two players, or up to five, six, seven, twenty players.

34
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:32,080
Speaker 0: However many people you can fit around a table, that's how many people can play these games.

35
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,099
Speaker 0: Of course, you can play it by yourself, but then you're just sort of training and practicing and things like that.

36
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,440
Speaker 0: The next thing that they've both got in common is that you don't have to be there for the beginning or the end of the game.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,140
Speaker 0: You can turn up any time you want throughout the game and start playing.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:50,000
Speaker 0: You just sort of look over and go, three, or set, or whatever you're going to call up, and you know, so you start a game like you and two other people.

39
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:57,700
Speaker 0: By the end of the game, ten more people could have turned up, but it doesn't spoil the game in any way, because you're still playing against the board, you're still playing along the other people, and you're still trying to win.

40
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,539
Speaker 0: And of course the same thing happens too.

41
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:07,900
Speaker 0: If you turn up, or if you're there at the beginning of the game, you can leave, go get a drink at the bar, get some food, come back, return, nobody's going to miss you at all.

42
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:30,460
Speaker 0: Another thing they've both got in common is that, of course the good players are always going to win, but winning is not the only goal, because it's a point system, so maybe a new player will come along, and they'll have a goal like, okay, I know I'm not going to win, I may not even get a single point, but you know, I'm going to get the solution to one of these, you know, before or as it's called by another player, and before it's been explained, and then the next goal can be, oh, I'm going to get a single point.

43
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:39,617
Speaker 0: And the next is going to be, I'm not going to come last, or then I'm going to come second, or then I'm going to try and take a few points away from the main one, then maybe I'm going to win.

44
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,720
Speaker 0: So lots and lots of different things you can do this.

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:53,260
Speaker 0: You can sit there and play a long time, and you can see new players come in, and then they suddenly get that first point, and they're like, yes, and it could be two games in, and then it could be another game before they get a next point, but it's still just as enjoyable.

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:19,640
Speaker 0: So all of these factors make these games perfect for informal gatherings, you know, at the often at the side of a hall, in a juggling convention, a game will start up, and the game will continue for maybe four, five hours in a row, but of course, the people at the beginning won't be there at the end, and the people at the end have maybe only come half an hour before, but the session will still be going, and you can just leave them running, and they sort of sweep up people, and yeah, it's just generally a really nice diversion for when you're not doing anything else.

47
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,760
Speaker 0: Finally, both games you can actually play by yourself as a puzzle game, like you say, to practice.

48
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:32,420
Speaker 0: Not only that, but they can actually be played on various places online, and I'll include the links to the games where you can play Set and Ricochet Robots online.

49
00:05:32,780 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 0: I don't actually do this very much, but there's a group of friends from the UK, you're living in Germany, they're in the UK, but we have a chat room that one of the guys coded up, and every day we chat there, and every day the Set and Ricochet Robot comes online, and every day, at one time during the day, all the chat suddenly disappears, and then people start posting their daily results, like 14, 14, 12, 12, 12, 9, 12, yeah, 9, thought so, got a 9, 2/8, 2/8, got something like that, and that's it, so you know, it just kills the chat room for a day while at least 20 people go in there and play Ricochet Robots and Set and some other games at the same time.

50
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,219
Speaker 0: Again, links in the show notes.

51
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,580
Speaker 0: So I'll start with Set, I guess talking a bit more in depth about Set, because it's a little bit easier than the other one to explain.

52
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:26,144
Speaker 0: Set is not a board game, it's actually a card game, and you've got a deck of cards and they're all unique, and you set them out 12 at a time, and if you see three cards that match into a set, you shout

53
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:26,626
Speaker 0: "Set!"

54
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:50,980
Speaker 0: and you scoop up the set, and that means you've got one point, you've got one set, and then three more cards are dealt face-up in their place, and the game continues with people calling Set till there's no more cards left, or there's no more cards left, or there's no more sets left to get, and if there's a set, you know, if 12 cards are out there and there's no sets being called for a while, you put out a 13th card and then a 14th card until Set is called, and of course at the end of the game, whoever has the most sets wins.

55
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,159
Speaker 0: So it sounds a bit like Snap, and it is a bit like Snap in a way, but it's like a really hard kind.

56
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,699
Speaker 0: Like I said, every card is unique, but there's four different ways a card can be different from another card.

57
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,340
Speaker 0: So each card shows one of three symbols, an oval, a diamond, or a squiggle.

58
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:13,580
Speaker 0: Also, these three symbols, there can be different numbers of them, so one, two, or three symbols.

59
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:28,760
Speaker 0: Also, each card has symbols that are either green, red, or purple, and on top of that, each card has the symbols either as sort of like a red outline or green outline and purple outline, or they're sort of shaded in slightly, or they're sort of a full block of colour.

60
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:40,599
Speaker 0: So to call a set, you must pick out three cards, which in all four of these different ways of these different values are either the same, or completely different from each other, on each card.

61
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Speaker 0: Again, it sounds a bit complicated, I'll just give an example, I guess is probably the best way to sort this out.

62
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Speaker 0: So card one can be one solid red diamond, card two, one solid red oval, and card three, one solid red squiggle.

63
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,659
Speaker 0: And all cards, you know, have one symbol, all cards are solid, all are red, but then they have three different symbols.

64
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:10,880
Speaker 0: You can't have one solid red diamond, one solid red diamond, one solid red oval, of course you can't because all cards are unique, but you can never have two of one thing and one of another in one of the values where they have to either be all the same or different.

65
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,180
Speaker 0: Another example could be you get one solid red diamond, two red solid ovals, and three red solid squiggles.

66
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:26,620
Speaker 0: So you know, you get red solid, all of them are red and solid, but then each three of them have a different number and a different symbol.

67
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:38,500
Speaker 0: And of course you can then have sort of one, I've got to think about this one, one solid red diamond, two shaded green oval, and three outlined purple squiggles.

68
00:08:39,201 --> 00:09:03,579
Speaker 0: So in that case, all cards are different in all of the values, but it doesn't really happen that often when you get that, but when it does happen, you know, it's like woohoo, all three different, and everyone high fives each other, actually they don't, they're getting on with the game and shouting set, but I guess the human brain spots similarities a bit quicker than they do the differences in the cards, so you know, the more similar the three cards have been moored in more ways, the quicker someone will shout set and scoop them up.

69
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:21,700
Speaker 0: So I actually first learned this game maybe six or seven years ago, and I started playing with other people, you know, other jugglers and things like that in the UK who are also new to the game, and I got to the point where I could win a lot of the games, you know, and you know, each game only lasts a few minutes, set is actually quite a quick game before you start again and start the next round, so I'd play a lot.

70
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:46,820
Speaker 0: The thing is, like I said, I lived in England at the time, and I'd only played against other English people, or British people, or Albionic as it's known here on Geek Nights, funny story about that, actually I was just on stage at the European Juggling Convention, and there's about, you know, I'm hosting the show, so maybe 1,500 people in front of me, and I say this next act is from London, and everyone goes reeee, or the London people go reeee, and I'm like cool, so who here's from London?

71
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,740
Speaker 0: More people go reeee, who here's from England?

72
00:09:48,980 --> 00:10:07,039
Speaker 0: More people go reeee, and then I said, who's here from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and less people went reeee, and I was like haha, some people don't know their own nationality as it appears on their passports, so yeah, it's not just people outside of England, Britain, the UK, who get confused about it, so yeah, Albionic.

73
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:09,818
Speaker 0: Anyway, where was I?

74
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,660
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I'd only played against English people.

75
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:45,340
Speaker 0: So I met this German girl who moved to the UK, and anyway, we sat down, and the dealer started dealing, Annette, the German girl, she just said set, and none of us had even started looking at the cards yet, and she got a set, and the game continued, and it was like Annette, set, and everyone else was, dammit, and then set, and everyone else, dammit, and set, and everyone else, oh fuck, Annette set, and it just carried on like this, and she just dominated the game, I think one other person got one set, and she got all the other sets, and it turns out that unless you're German, you really suck at this game, it's just that simple.

76
00:10:45,540 --> 00:11:17,080
Speaker 0: Germans absolutely dominate this game, as I said I was just at the EJC, the European Juggling Convention, and there was a set tournament took place, and they organised it and played it, and I actually watched one of the games later on in the tournament, and it really, really put me in my place, because the game lasted like less than a minute, it was just like set, set, set, set, set, set, set, and they had to have a dedicated dealer to actually put the cards out there, because if one person is dealing, and the other person is just looking and calling sets, sometimes the other person can have a bit of an advantage there.

77
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:30,478
Speaker 0: So this game is actually really good fun, like I say, it really, like, it doesn't take long to play, and you can play with any number of players, and I really think you should get a copy of this and just give it a go, or at least play it for a few days online, or just try it out online and sort of get used to it.

78
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,740
Speaker 0: As I said, I thought I was actually good at this once, but it turns out against Germans.

79
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,760
Speaker 0: I'm really, really not that good.

80
00:11:38,341 --> 00:12:17,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, moving on to Ricochet Robots, this game is a bit more complicated, so to set it out you've got a board, this is a proper board game this time, you've got a board with four quarters which are printed on both sides, which is cool because you can arrange the board sort of randomly in many, many different ways of playing, so each game has a different board, up to however long it's going to be before you get round to that next, or that first way of playing again, and so the four quarters fit together to form a kind of maze, but it's like a very open maze with a border around the edge, so you can't go off the edge, and there's lots of little L-shaped walls in the interior, and it's got this cool industrial sci-fi kind of styling which is pretty cool.

81
00:12:18,320 --> 00:13:19,382
Speaker 0: Anyway, within the maze there's like 16 goals within little L-shaped bits of walls, and each goal is a different colour, I think there's red, blue, green and yellow, and there's four different kinds of symbols, so there's 16 goals, I think there's like a triangle, there's a planet, a swirly something, and I can't remember what the other one is, but at the end of the maze is called robots, because they look a little bit like circular robots, and they've each got one of the four colours too, and you set them at random, and there's the beginning of the game, and you sort of just, you know, you drop tiles onto the board to see where they're going to be, so next, someone turns over one of the small circular tiles, and again there's 16 of these, or 17, because there's one sort of joker where you go anywhere, and on it is a colour and a symbol, or a symbol of a certain colour matching one of the goals of the board, and that begins the round, so the idea now is to bounce the robots around the board until the robot matching the colour on the selected tile arrives at the goal on the tile, so the robots start moving in one direction, you hold onto the blue and you go.

82
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:26,000
Speaker 0: okay I'm going to move the blue left, and it keeps moving in a straight line until it bumps into wall, and then it stops, and that's one move, and then you go.

83
00:13:26,100 --> 00:15:36,848
Speaker 0: okay now I need to move it up, so you move it up, and it hits the edge of the board and it stops there, and then you move it right, and it hits a robot and it stops there, so that would be like three moves to get there, so everyone actually looks at the board and they've got to sort of mentally track in their brain the shortest route possible that they can get the blue robot onto the blue triangle goal, for example, so you're thinking right, up, across, down, left, right, and bingo, you're there, seven moves, so you think seven moves and you call out seven, and once you call out, or once the first person calls out seven, that's the first call, so an egg timer is flipped over and everyone else has a minute to find a shorter route and call a lower number, and if someone calls a lower number, and they say six, and everyone goes, oh yeah, six, someone will go five, and oh five, great, stuff like that, so then once the time is up, the person shows their route around and everyone goes yep, very good, very good, like that, and the lowest number of course is the one that wins, and they get the tile and they get one point, of course if you call five, and then you go, oh no six, your five doesn't count, that's your lowest bid, and then you're out, you know, unless you can actually find a five, which normally you can't, and the best thing about this game is when you get a blue robot, you don't have to just move the blue robot to get to the blue destination, you can move, say, the red robot and then bounce the blue robot off the red robot, and use the yellow robot to stop the red one and stuff like that, so you can maybe get somewhere with twelve moves by just moving the blue, but if you move the green, just sort of about there, and then bounce the blue off it there, you can get there in eight, of course you say eight, and then someone calls out seven, because they've used the red and the yellow to get to the same place, so around will go something like this, fifteen, fourteen, oh yeah, fourteen, fourteen, ten, ten, ten, ten, like that, and it just goes on down the numbers, down the numbers and stuff, and the best thing is about it, at the end, you get some really really creative solutions to the puzzle, because the board is different all the time, and every situation is going to be different, no two ricochet robot games will ever be the same, I guess it's like going that way, the amount of things that can happen means that every game is totally different, the robots will always be in different places, and the board will always be in different configurations.

84
00:15:37,130 --> 00:16:03,982
Speaker 0: when you flip over one of the tiles, so one person will go, oh here's ten, and everyone will go, way ten, really cool like that, and they show them, it's like really cool, and then someone will say, oh but I had another ten that looked a bit like this, and they'll show it and it's a different solution, but this one will say, hey look at my twelve, and they show the twelve and they actually bounce all of the robots off each other three times in every different part of the board and get there, so again the stylish solutions get a lot more kudos, but they won't win you the game, but sometimes if you just, you know, it's really cool at the end of the game just to share.

85
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:43,392
Speaker 0: And the cool thing is again, I was just talking to a German friend of mine who lives down the street in Berlin, and he has the biggest collection of board games of anybody else I ever known, and he actually told a similar story to mine, because he played ricochet robots at home with his girlfriend, and he thought he did quite well, and then he sat down with some English players at the EJC last week, and it turns out English players play it a whole lot more than Germans, this ricochet robots game, and he didn't manage to win a single point in the first few games he played, because it turns out the English, especially the London jugglers, and some others, they just play this all the time whenever they meet up, and yeah, they are really, really shit hot.

86
00:16:44,535 --> 00:17:09,873
Speaker 0: There's a few variations to help new players I guess in ricochet robots, but I'm not sure if they're official or if they're house rules or anything like that, and one is to let, say a new player comes along, if they manage, say the best thing that anybody else calls out is "ten", and within that minute the new player can also call out ten, and they don't have a piece yet, they get that point, if they can find within a minute the lowest call.

87
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:49,591
Speaker 0: The thing is, I don't really normally play like that, because we normally try and make it a bit harder, because you know, we're all good at it, you don't really, of course the new players they can come along, they can do that, but we make it different by saying no solution can be under five moves, so if you get there, say, like you turn over the blue triangle, and you can get there with the blue thing in two moves, so instead of just calling out two, and then the new player going "oh, oh yeah, two, I can see that", and them getting the point, and it just being a waste of a tile, or a waste of that part of the game, we made a rule that if it's under five moves, it can't be under five moves, and you've got to come up with a new lowest number of moves to win, but that's five or over.

88
00:17:49,993 --> 00:18:00,350
Speaker 0: Then the solution itself can't contain the lowest solution entirely, so if the solution is sort of like blue goes up, left, down, you can't have up, left, right, left, down.

89
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:08,983
Speaker 0: That's not allowed, you know, you've got to come up with something where you don't go across all of the gaps that the lowest solution solves.

90
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:11,292
Speaker 0: Again, that's maybe a bit tricky to explain.

91
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:14,726
Speaker 0: And there's also some official ricochet robots expansions.

92
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,066
Speaker 0: There's one with a silver robot, and one with diagonal walls in the maze, and things like that.

93
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,174
Speaker 0: I've not really played them much.

94
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:26,301
Speaker 0: I've played them a bit, and they're alright, but I actually just like the normal game itself, the original game itself.

95
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:44,369
Speaker 0: Once I did actually come up with my own expansion, which is called the ramp piece, because the silver robot, what happens is that you just use it like another robot, but you never have to move it to any destination, and there's the diagonal walls, which you can bounce off, like you can ricochet off, but it only counts as one move, because you can't stop there, you actually bounce off the one.

96
00:18:44,872 --> 00:19:01,259
Speaker 0: The ramp move, or the ramp piece that I made, was that it moves like a robot, but when it's in front of a wall, and another robot goes into it, it jumps over the ramp, over the wall behind it, and then lands on the next empty square, and then keeps going on until it hits another wall or robot.

97
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,848
Speaker 0: And again, it's just a little expansion which works just as well as the official expansions and actually costs nothing extra.

98
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:13,192
Speaker 0: In fact, the silver robot expansion doesn't cost anything extra, just use a chess piece of some kind, I guess.

99
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:26,166
Speaker 0: So, playing ricochet robots is actually quite a strange experience, and actually like a full game of set, even though the full game of set only lasts a few minutes, and playing a single round of ricochet robots takes maybe about a minute or so as well.

100
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:33,076
Speaker 0: But between the tile of ricochet robots, you turn over a tile, and then everything just goes exactly silent, and everyone just sits there.

101
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:50,202
Speaker 0: And then someone turns, you know, someone calls them out and the timer is turned, and there's nothing but motionless players, sort of eyes flicking about the board, you know, and sort of like lower numbers being said quietly, sort of five, five, five, four, four, well it can't do that actually in our rules, but there you go, it just keeps going down and down and down.

102
00:19:50,424 --> 00:20:02,227
Speaker 0: And then as soon as the timer runs out, there's a big explosion of activity with people chatting and discussing and getting up and leaving and coming back and then, you know, talking about it and sharing the different solutions, and then suddenly someone will flick a tile over and there's back to silence.

103
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,675
Speaker 0: And nothing at all is happening.

104
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:13,371
Speaker 0: As I said, set is quite the same, but the chatting and activity normally happens at the end of each game rather than at the end of each round within one game.

105
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:23,616
Speaker 0: So ricochet robots is a damn good game, I'd give it four stars out of five, however I know a lot of people who really, really hate the game, they just look at it and they just can't get into it at all.

106
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:32,663
Speaker 0: And also at juggling conventions you have sort of ricochet robot widows and stuff, like with the guys going over to play the game and leaving the girlfriends just sitting there chatting and things like that.

107
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:39,169
Speaker 0: So maybe this is all genetic, I don't know, maybe people can just do puzzle games like this and some people can't.

108
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,527
Speaker 0: I can, but I know that compared to most people I'm just not so good at this.

109
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:52,125
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's about it really, I guess these discussions of ricochet robots and set really maybe help you decide if you want to buy them, if they're good for you or not.

110
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:59,620
Speaker 0: Again, you don't sit down and play them as a normal card game or as a normal board game, you can do, but it's pretty much a great game to have.

111
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:09,447
Speaker 0: Maybe if you're at a board gaming meetup or some other kind of meetup, just set it on a table and just leave it there and when people want to come along you need like minimum two players to be on each of these games.

112
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:10,654
Speaker 0: Just sort of leave it set up.

113
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:19,843
Speaker 0: so if someone's waiting for another game to start or they've been, you know, they've been eliminated from a game or from a tournament, they can just go over there, sit there, play ricochet robots, people can come and go.

114
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:31,284
Speaker 0: And yeah, it's just one of those cool casual games that you can just pick up and people can come and go and that's why I'd recommend it, these group puzzle solving kind of games.

115
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,674
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm waffling on now.

116
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:34,738
Speaker 0: I guess I'm going to catch you later.

117
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:37,672
Speaker 0: My name's Luke Bewitch, I hope you've enjoyed me here.

118
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:41,052
Speaker 0: filling in for Rim and Scott, a short little show, but that's all I'm going to do.

119
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:42,100
Speaker 0: See you later.
