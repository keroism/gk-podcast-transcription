1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,400
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:11,245
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday April 8th.

3
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:11,907
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

4
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:16,440
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight a bunch of comics and manga and anime.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,990
Speaker 1: We were having a little trouble watching anime lately since the boxy subtitles stopped working.

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think in a recent update some subtitle stuff got messed up, but I think in a more recent update It got fixed.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,728
Speaker 0: so I got it.

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,685
Speaker 0: Yeah I just got to install the latest latest and we'll see what happens.

10
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:50,150
Speaker 1: it was that most Infuriating problem where they didn't just not work at all because then you go you don't watch anime.

11
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:56,230
Speaker 1: They worked for a while and then bit by bit every now, and then we'd miss like one subtitle.

12
00:00:56,391 --> 00:01:01,730
Speaker 0: I think it was dropping frames for some reason and thus because it dropped the frame it dropped associated subtitle.

13
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:07,790
Speaker 0: So even in the subsequent frames the subtitle wasn't there because the frame where the subtitle was supposed to be was dropped.

14
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,177
Speaker 0: So the other time never appeared.

15
00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:14,803
Speaker 1: and but it's infuriating because you know Well, we'll miss a line and neither one of us will say anything.

16
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:16,450
Speaker 1: because alright just one.

17
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:17,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you think.

18
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,304
Speaker 0: sometimes the fansubbers, you know intentionally drop out a line.

19
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:25,139
Speaker 0: for example if someone's like, Ohio They don't put a subtitle in.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,927
Speaker 0: not every you know, it's not fans.

21
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,850
Speaker 1: But yeah Even if you know you're losing them, you know, we know we have this problem.

22
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:35,465
Speaker 1: You keep watching because you can still like if you're an anime fan, you've watched enough anime.

23
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:40,182
Speaker 1: I understand it of Japanese To get a lot further than I would expect.

24
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:52,990
Speaker 0: but if the voice acting is good You don't even need to know what the words are Pictures and just the tone and you're good, but depending on the show I mean if it's a talking heads show good luck with the longer it goes on.

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,650
Speaker 1: However, like if I miss every fifth line, I kind of still know what's going on from context and responses.

26
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:01,250
Speaker 0: But if you miss a few in a row, you're in trouble.

27
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:09,235
Speaker 1: Yeah It got to the point where a character is like says something long and complicated with no subtitle and then the person responding says Yeah, what are you thinking?

28
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:12,467
Speaker 1: And I get that subtitle even though I didn't need that one.

29
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:12,869
Speaker 1: Yeah.

30
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,500
Speaker 1: All right But then it would just get out of control.

31
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:21,047
Speaker 1: and one thing I learned is porphy's long and tedious adventure.

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:32,057
Speaker 1: Okay, it seemed I don't know I was interested in it before when I was missing all these subtitles and I thought something was going On but watching it with the subtitles.

33
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:36,170
Speaker 1: I realized that nothing was going on and there's like a hundred episodes of that thing.

34
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,174
Speaker 0: Is there really?

35
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:38,821
Speaker 1: I don't know how many there have to be.

36
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:39,464
Speaker 0: you look it up.

37
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,750
Speaker 1: No, I have no idea.

38
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,538
Speaker 1: All I know is that it was about a long journey.

39
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:47,590
Speaker 1: He did not leave his house in the first episode.

40
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:53,047
Speaker 1: So, I don't know what kind of journey he was going on to the outhouse and back.

41
00:02:54,131 --> 00:03:00,610
Speaker 1: That show had all the tedium of Romeo's blue sky without the crippling tragedy to back it up.

42
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,329
Speaker 0: It might add crippling tragedy just not in the first episode.

43
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:13,990
Speaker 1: By the point we gave up on porphy's in Romeo's blue skies He had already had like every member of his family die of cancer house burned down goat dead.

44
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:20,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, does anyone out there besides us even know what Romeo's blue sky is let alone watched it.

45
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:25,561
Speaker 1: I'm sure Daryl Surratt knows Maybe I like Romeo's blue sky.

46
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:26,303
Speaker 1: I enjoy it.

47
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:28,190
Speaker 0: It's it's not a the worst anime.

48
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:33,590
Speaker 1: It was fun watching and I remember just every time things start to get a little bit better.

49
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:42,420
Speaker 1: Like I remember this scene early on where the house the farm burns down because the evil guy burned down their farm To force the family to sell the child into slavery.

50
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:47,490
Speaker 1: and you're like, all right the house burn farm burn down Father's gonna have to sell the son into slavery.

51
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:48,618
Speaker 1: This is what we expected.

52
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,229
Speaker 1: and then the dad's like, you know what?

53
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,881
Speaker 1: We can still pull this off even though it all got burned down.

54
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,266
Speaker 1: We're not selling you into slavery.

55
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:55,868
Speaker 1: We're gonna make it.

56
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:59,061
Speaker 1: Two seconds later father has like a heart attack.

57
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:04,901
Speaker 0: I think or he goes blind or something happens Forget but it's pretty much just the most tragic things imaginable.

58
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:22,968
Speaker 1: It's just like oh Yeah Tragedies, but at least we got the subtitles working and we got to see the wonder that is Valen noir.

59
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:25,860
Speaker 1: No great I think that's the best show this season.

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:36,939
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's not from the season That's not let alone other things that are wrong with what you just said Ignoring those.

61
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:37,828
Speaker 0: it's not from the season.

62
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,314
Speaker 1: Anime news for me.

63
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:44,407
Speaker 0: No, there is no anime news, you know anime industries in the shitter yada yada yada.

64
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:45,250
Speaker 0: nothing new, right?

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got I'm gonna do a. we're gonna talk about I guess a bunch of stuff.

66
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:54,547
Speaker 0: this episode I think I don't know but I wanted to talk about something that you didn't read.

67
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:58,822
Speaker 0: that way It is not delayed in its deliverance to the to the listeners.

68
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:05,510
Speaker 0: All right, but I read all hail Megatron I know but you did not read a drifting life by Yoshihiro Tatsumi.

69
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is you realize how high up that got on my cue from when I first knew it existed, right?

70
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,016
Speaker 0: So this this is a book Yoshihiro Tatsumi.

71
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,281
Speaker 0: we've talked about him before.

72
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,730
Speaker 0: he is the father of the Gekiga, right?

73
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,237
Speaker 0: This is his memoir.

74
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:30,104
Speaker 0: So you when you read this right it like It doesn't have all the stuff that hit these actual non memoir comics.

75
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:38,280
Speaker 0: have you know, like, you know treating women badly and and dour society and all those sorts of things.

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,406
Speaker 0: it's just it's.

77
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:44,521
Speaker 0: it's very Autobiographical as a memoir is and he's still alive.

78
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:44,983
Speaker 0: Actually.

79
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:47,410
Speaker 0: I think he's like 80 something now anyway.

80
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,660
Speaker 0: So this book is actually gigantic.

81
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,090
Speaker 0: It's like an 800 something page memoir.

82
00:05:54,391 --> 00:06:05,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like 800 and something pages from drawing quarterly the same people who publishes other stuff in the u.s and it is $30, but it's probably a lot less than that on Amazon or something like that.

83
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,869
Speaker 0: and Like I thought this is gonna be you know epic.

84
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:13,748
Speaker 0: This is like beyond epic because what this does right is in the u.s.

85
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,655
Speaker 0: There's sort of like this this, you know comic book history in the United States You know that and there's.

86
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:22,110
Speaker 0: so there's many things in that comic book history.

87
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:37,650
Speaker 0: You know, it's you got Simon and Schuster making Superman and then losing the rights and you got the whole, you know Eisner and Eiger thing going on you get the Stanley and you know, Jack Kirby and then splitting up thing going on, right?

88
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:45,360
Speaker 0: There's all these things in comic book history that that comic book, you know US comic book nerds know about and it's all sort of.

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,082
Speaker 0: actually it's.

90
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:56,410
Speaker 0: it's almost like a mythology in and of itself even though it's You know 90% true, yeah, but it at least takes on the same proportions of like a crowsers legend, right?

91
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,610
Speaker 0: Right, right, but if you look at you know, Japanese manga history, right?

92
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,072
Speaker 0: It's like.

93
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:05,370
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are plenty of people who know all about it, right?

94
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,370
Speaker 0: But you know manga fans in the US typically don't know too much about it.

95
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:09,671
Speaker 0: Like.

96
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:13,530
Speaker 0: I know more about you know, the superhero comic history than the manga history.

97
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:25,023
Speaker 0: I mean, I know stuff like Tezuka came around and he was the business and then there was this gecky gun movement and Nowadays, it's you know, it's all that was quite a skin all shown and jump.

98
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:25,766
Speaker 0: That's like drag.

99
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:26,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there were these Greeks.

100
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Romans conquered him and then super high.

101
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,209
Speaker 0: It's like you don't know too much about it, right?

102
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:38,326
Speaker 0: but you read this and Like this is like oh shit.

103
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:39,752
Speaker 0: Oh Shit.

104
00:07:39,832 --> 00:08:08,826
Speaker 0: and you like I. now this has like all the business in it Like oh my god, I can't even begin like everything from when Tatsumi and his brother were like sending in little strip comics into Manga shonen and then like getting medals as awards for you know for putting it sending in the best comics like up to like dealing with all these different publishers and like You know having the publishers like move them from place to place, you know.

105
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:12,339
Speaker 0: and like fighting over You know, which artists work for which publishers.

106
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,620
Speaker 0: and you know, one guy was like, you know You know, no, this is gecky guy.

107
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:27,736
Speaker 0: The other guy is like, you know, it's like something else, you know they're fighting over which name to call it and you know all this kind of in all the different like Anthologies that they work it.

108
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:31,610
Speaker 0: and you know, I'll get my work into this publisher and I'll get it over.

109
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,484
Speaker 0: you know work over in this one and all these different people.

110
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:40,048
Speaker 0: and you see like the The gogo 13 guys in here and Tezuka is in here.

111
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:52,604
Speaker 0: The thing is Kazuo Koke was only mentioned once in passing unless someone in this is Kazuo Koke And because some of the names are changed like it's weird, even though it's a memoir, right?

112
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,650
Speaker 0: He changes his own name.

113
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,295
Speaker 0: It's not a you know, like.

114
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:07,910
Speaker 0: it's not Yoshihiro Tatsumi in the book, even though his byline is on the cover of the book It's like, you know a slightly changed name that basically sounds just like his name Yoshihiro Batsumi.

115
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:10,358
Speaker 0: No, it's it's something along those lines.

116
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:11,521
Speaker 0: Let me let me see what it is.

117
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:11,963
Speaker 0: Hold on.

118
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:13,207
Speaker 0: I think it's like.

119
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:18,112
Speaker 0: I think it's like Like something katsumi Aha.

120
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:30,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, by the way, that's the point is is that this is like so amazingly fantastic like in so many ways and it's gigantic and Like.

121
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:35,820
Speaker 0: it might be one of the best not just one of the best like, you know Biographical comics I've read because I've read quite a few.

122
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:43,670
Speaker 0: this might be one of the best like Autobiographies I've read or memoirs at least because it was interesting a memoir and an autobiography.

123
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:45,156
Speaker 0: What is there a difference?

124
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,481
Speaker 1: Um, you know what.

125
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:48,830
Speaker 1: I was about to make something up, but I don't really know.

126
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:51,304
Speaker 0: Well, I think you know, well judging from this right?

127
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,430
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess not.

128
00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:08,062
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know but the point is this is really really amazing and if you care about Manga at all, even if you don't care about gecky guy or whatever, right if you're a person who reads manga This is something to read for reals like times a billion

129
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,089
Speaker 1: and we will almost not.

130
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,162
Speaker 1: almost We will be doing a show on this at some point.

131
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,890
Speaker 1: I got to finish reading Kevlar and clay first.

132
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, then we could do a show on that one.

133
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,404
Speaker 0: Maybe we could just make this the book club.

134
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:19,970
Speaker 0: it is big enough.

135
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:20,933
Speaker 1: I think we should.

136
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,237
Speaker 0: my that might work.

137
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:22,959
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll see.

138
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,183
Speaker 0: we'll just we'll figure it out.

139
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:24,664
Speaker 1: All right.

140
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:28,070
Speaker 0: All right, so, uh That's a geek bite.

141
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:38,826
Speaker 1: I have three nouns that have all appeared in the same News headline and the nature of these three nouns makes that all together surprising.

142
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:43,377
Speaker 1: now in the first Leonardo DiCaprio All right.

Speaker 1: All right now in the second Smap.

144
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:47,942
Speaker 0: All right

145
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,967
Speaker 1: now in the third ninja scroll, okay,

146
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,088
Speaker 0: I

147
00:10:53,911 --> 00:11:10,389
Speaker 1: Don't I don't want to get into this because you know, the whole thing about movies don't actually get made and whatever but it Apparently one thing is led to another and Leonardo DiCaprio Wants to cast Smap in the upcoming live-action ninja scroll anime movie

148
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,674
Speaker 0: Adaptation.

149
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,009
Speaker 0: is that coming out before or after?

150
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,577
Speaker 0: Live action Ava live-action Akira.

151
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,182
Speaker 1: This has a lot more shots in life.

152
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:23,169
Speaker 1: I'll say this live-action Dragon Ball happened Live action Ava is a scan.

153
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,207
Speaker 1: That'll never happen.

154
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,017
Speaker 0: I'm actually cowboy bebop.

155
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,001
Speaker 1: You know what?

156
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,889
Speaker 1: I honestly think that's gonna happen, too.

157
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:42,964
Speaker 1: I don't know Because these are situations where you've got people with money and connections in the industry who for whatever reason want these to come to pass And I mean we the cowboy bebop thing.

158
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:46,843
Speaker 1: Keanu Reeves Knows Watanabe and they have talked about it.

159
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:47,687
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

160
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,945
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, yeah, no that was actually.

161
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:51,790
Speaker 1: that's pretty verified.

162
00:11:52,051 --> 00:12:00,022
Speaker 0: So if a famous but basically you're saying because the famous person is involved that it's gonna happen Well, here's a famous person involved with your Leonardo DiCaprio.

163
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:06,990
Speaker 1: What I know what I'm saying is I'm pretty sure This is gonna happen or at least it's gonna get to the point where it was gonna happen.

164
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:09,198
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll do something and then it'll fall apart.

165
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,025
Speaker 0: It's gonna be tear if it happens.

166
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:12,290
Speaker 0: It's gonna be terrible.

167
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:19,190
Speaker 1: I don't think this is the Ava movie situation, which I am so sure is just a money-making scam.

168
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:20,617
Speaker 1: I don't think that.

169
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:29,110
Speaker 1: like that the odds of this are Slightly better than the odds of Duke Nukem forever actually coming out right right after the Phantom game console.

170
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:34,202
Speaker 1: Well Duke Nukem got so close the Amazon pre-order appeared again.

171
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:36,810
Speaker 1: And yeah, that was a while ago.

172
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:41,446
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna bother with the rest of this article, but I found that interesting.

173
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:48,729
Speaker 1: my real news she's so absurd is that the Japanese anime TV rankings have something interesting.

174
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,484
Speaker 1: Lupin the third versus detective Conan kicked the shit out of everything.

175
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,470
Speaker 0: That's why is that interesting?

176
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,298
Speaker 0: That's totally obvious that that would happen.

177
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,790
Speaker 1: No, because it even beat us as I saw.

178
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's you know, it's that's not a big deal.

179
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,330
Speaker 0: I mean sadly sign is always gonna be there, you know.

180
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,122
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it'll always.

181
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:08,809
Speaker 0: it's like the Simpsons, you know Doesn't have to be number one.

182
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:13,510
Speaker 1: Interesting was I I knew about Lupin the third detective Conan.

183
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,964
Speaker 1: I kind of just you know, I figured I'd watch it at some point.

184
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,726
Speaker 1: one thing I did not realize until it was put into stark contrast before me.

185
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:26,974
Speaker 1: Is that Neither's character design has in any way Accommodated the other.

186
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:30,647
Speaker 1: Conan looks like Conan and Lupin looks like a red Lupin.

187
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:31,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you do?

188
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,924
Speaker 0: You can't you're gonna modify one of the other here.

189
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:34,569
Speaker 0: It's not gonna work.

190
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:37,190
Speaker 1: But as a result, it looks so weird.

191
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:39,779
Speaker 0: Yet it's the most watched.

192
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,810
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the reason is the most watched.

193
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:51,439
Speaker 1: I mean if you took that's like if if it was Simpsons South Park, and I don't know cuz I could to make it epic enough In America, I got to pick some old cartoon like Mighty Mouse.

194
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, right or like, you know, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny, that's what you know.

195
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:01,170
Speaker 1: Well, we kind of got that in who framed Roger Rabbit.

196
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:04,602
Speaker 1: Almost almost it was that was the closest we ever got.

197
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:07,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, you know, it's you take Something.

198
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:08,515
Speaker 0: that's so.

199
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:18,570
Speaker 0: Lupin is so popular right that even though there's no TV show And I don't know if there's a running manga currently that they can make multiple TV specials every year.

200
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,798
Speaker 0: you know and people watch them and they did.

201
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,624
Speaker 0: it's worth continuing to make more.

202
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:23,287
Speaker 0: it's too popular.

203
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:26,339
Speaker 0: Lupin is and Detective Conan is popular enough.

204
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,570
Speaker 0: that is TV show and manga I think are still continuing sort of perpetually.

205
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:36,968
Speaker 0: so if you combine the two, it's a guaranteed winner and that's why they did it.

206
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:44,026
Speaker 0: and I think What really is that Japan doesn't do these things often enough, you know in the u.s.

207
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:49,260
Speaker 0: Anything like that I would like to point out milked it to fuck.

208
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,762
Speaker 1: I would like to point out for everyone who does not remember The Jetsons meet the Flintstones.

209
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,350
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but those are the same company.

210
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,321
Speaker 1: It was but it was but it was still.

211
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:05,250
Speaker 0: yeah, but the point is, you know That stuff is all you know, if it's not two companies competing with each other, right?

212
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:10,188
Speaker 0: that stuff gets milked to all hell just to get the most money possible.

213
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:15,590
Speaker 0: and Japan with an ailing anime industry, I think might start doing stuff like that more.

214
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,250
Speaker 0: But if they do too much it won't work anymore.

215
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:26,090
Speaker 0: So you gotta you know plus things like that have always been popular in Japan and you know in manga and doujinshi And you know video games like super robot wars, right?

216
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,350
Speaker 0: So why not actually make an anime that say is like Gundam and macross, you know, they should go for it.

217
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,356
Speaker 0: That would be a huge huge hit.

218
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:38,448
Speaker 1: thing is what I'm curious about is Conan's got nothing on lip on duh.

219
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,137
Speaker 1: So how is this even a competition?

220
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,944
Speaker 1: I mean, it's red lip on to it.

221
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:43,766
Speaker 0: What are you shot him?

222
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:44,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

223
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:47,239
Speaker 1: But I do have one more news.

224
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:56,063
Speaker 1: I mean, there's not much anime news, but Yeah, well I Noticed something interesting that I kind of want to bring up out there.

225
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:59,017
Speaker 0: for anyone who's curious anime news networks The only place to get my news.

226
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:05,686
Speaker 1: if you want to do a panel at Otacon I don't think it is going to be hard for you to get your panel.

227
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:09,600
Speaker 1: I This is totally based on speculation on my part.

228
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:12,590
Speaker 1: This is not any like insider information.

229
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,703
Speaker 1: I know sometimes we get the inside scoop from some of our friends at Otacon But this is purely coming out of my mouth.

230
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,970
Speaker 1: So I can't back this up at all.

231
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:26,247
Speaker 1: I don't think Otacon is even close to having enough panels to filling their panel rooms this year.

232
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,034
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Point.

233
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,570
Speaker 1: the first they could not fill them last year.

234
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:37,509
Speaker 1: That is why you saw rim and Scott do the advanced wars panel in a workshop room.

235
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:39,942
Speaker 1: They just they didn't have enough panels.

236
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:40,970
Speaker 1: There was a bunch of empty space.

237
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,738
Speaker 0: So I think the problem there was.

238
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:43,984
Speaker 0: they didn't have enough workshops.

239
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:45,410
Speaker 0: not that enough panels.

240
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:49,756
Speaker 0: Well, they they devoted a couple of rooms to workshops But couldn't get enough workshops for them.

241
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:54,882
Speaker 1: thing is they obviously were willing to put panels to fill up the space and weren't able To do that either.

242
00:16:55,066 --> 00:17:09,099
Speaker 1: Yep So as a result gig nights did the advanced wars panel which actually It kind of saddens me how many people showed up to that and how many of those people seem to think that we were somehow In the industry or somehow new.

243
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,105
Speaker 0: so I don't know they didn't.

244
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,170
Speaker 0: they didn't think we're Indian.

245
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,185
Speaker 1: The questions they asked were questions that I would ask like the creator of advanced people.

246
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:25,930
Speaker 0: It's it's amazing how You know I've been to a lot of panels at a lot of conventions and it's like People who go to these panels and ask questions are people who don't read the internet at all?

247
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,310
Speaker 0: They just don't know they never been to go Taku, right?

248
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:35,249
Speaker 0: So if I stand up and say, you know, like what's big in the video game news right now stuff about like we motion plus, right?

249
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,870
Speaker 0: Most people don't even know we motion plus exists.

250
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:49,290
Speaker 0: If I go up and I do a panel on we motion plus people start asking me questions like I'm from Nintendo because they have no clue and I'm standing in a position of authority.

251
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,223
Speaker 0: I'm not I don't work for Nintendo or anything.

252
00:17:54,303 --> 00:18:00,010
Speaker 1: It's it's amazing how much authority you get by Wearing a jacket and standing behind a tape, right?

253
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:10,126
Speaker 0: So then I say some things that these people have no idea about because they don't know the internet exists and they don't read blogs Even though it's common knowledge amongst anyone who reads blogs and knows what the hell's going on.

254
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,270
Speaker 0: It pays attention to the news.

255
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:13,879
Speaker 0: So suddenly I to them.

256
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,785
Speaker 0: I'm someone who knows crazy things.

257
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:17,210
Speaker 0: Oh my god as the guy knows so much.

258
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:25,057
Speaker 0: So they'll just start asking me like any question they have without any amount of thinking, you know Whether that's actually a question.

259
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:27,143
Speaker 0: I'll be able to answer or not because they'll have.

260
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:30,815
Speaker 0: so because as far as they're concerned I'm someone who knows amazing things.

261
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:43,610
Speaker 0: They can't possibly be known so they have no context with which to discern what questions I would be able to answer and what I wouldn't because if they did have that context They would have be a blog reader and would know everything and I would never think nothing to teach them.

262
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:57,372
Speaker 0: So if you want to give a panel right at conventions and sound really smart to the like most people just like read anime news network and then do a panel on like something that's In the news and like 80% of the people who come to your panel of you know You'll.

263
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,329
Speaker 0: it'll be all new information to them Even though it was just you know.

264
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:04,290
Speaker 0: You're telling them what you learned from anime news network like a few weeks ago.

265
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,839
Speaker 1: Don't really do that because we're trying to end panels like that.

266
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a bad panel, but I'm just saying that works here.

267
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:18,396
Speaker 1: Here's the problem and that's why the advance or his panel worked aside from the fact that last year Oh to count did not have enough panels and we Kind of filled in for that.

268
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:29,578
Speaker 1: but this year I'm gonna read a quote from the Otacon panels application page Which they have reminded people exists a couple times so far Clarification about the maximum number of panelists.

269
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:39,509
Speaker 1: this year due to expansion into the Hilton Increasing the number of panel rooms and other factors we have had to adjust the maximum number of panelists.

270
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:45,230
Speaker 1: This is to ensure that we have the ability to provide panels and panelists for all our rooms.

271
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:49,230
Speaker 1: There is a limit now of two panelists per panel.

272
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:53,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, there can be more than two but those people will not be compensated now.

273
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:59,317
Speaker 1: clearly they do not have enough panels and They want to fill out all their panel space.

274
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:03,170
Speaker 1: So they're trying to thin out the existing panels.

275
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:11,164
Speaker 1: They're trying to get people who would normally have four people run one panel Submit two separate panels of two people each and then schedule both of them.

276
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:14,383
Speaker 1: This does not bode well at all.

277
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:24,450
Speaker 0: a lot of thing is majority of the panels that had a lot of people on them were the kind of panel were like maybe one person decides to have one and then like all their friends like.

278
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:27,939
Speaker 0: And then it's like just the friends go in a blob.

279
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:40,530
Speaker 1: now see originally when they said only two people get compensated I thought this was great because this really weeds out the people who get you some giant panel so they can get a bunch of Badges and it really makes it that only the serious people would get panels.

280
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:43,770
Speaker 1: But now I worry that that's not the case.

281
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,004
Speaker 0: I mean, I think obviously it seems as if right.

282
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:51,029
Speaker 0: we'd like them to raise the bar But it seems like raising the bar might not fill the rooms.

283
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:59,556
Speaker 0: Well, especially because they have more panel rooms, which yeah, maybe a mistake maybe but the thing is they got more rooms And they're using every room they've got.

284
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:03,430
Speaker 0: so they figure and you know things fill up and people are sitting on the floor.

285
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:11,103
Speaker 0: So it sort of makes you know, I think what they need is you know Not more rooms, but the same number of rooms only bigger room.

286
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,708
Speaker 1: That's not so doable though.

287
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:13,210
Speaker 0: I know.

288
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:18,710
Speaker 0: However, I guess or at least if instead of you know, you get the more space, right?

289
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,449
Speaker 0: So that way you still have the same number of rooms But like, you know say workshop one and two were next to each other.

290
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,220
Speaker 0: You can sort of there's a wall in between.

291
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,809
Speaker 0: I think it's movable maybe right.

292
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,290
Speaker 0: So you like move that wall and now you just have big workshop over there.

293
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:34,630
Speaker 1: You could do stuff like that, right, but even then remember it's all new space too in the Hilton.

294
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,334
Speaker 0: I know right.

295
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:36,843
Speaker 0: I don't know what that space looks like either.

296
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:44,100
Speaker 1: So it's a total total and I guess what's gonna hurt more is that Up until recently especially with anime cons and cons.

297
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,136
Speaker 1: We like like Otakon we would always kind of accommodate like we like.

298
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:54,229
Speaker 1: we did I think eight or nine panels at a Kinetic on ones because they didn't have enough panels and We filled in for Otakon last year.

299
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,264
Speaker 1: But our policy this year was to not do a panel.

300
00:21:58,304 --> 00:22:00,150
Speaker 1: that isn't one of our awesome a-list panels.

301
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,610
Speaker 1: So I only planned on doing like three panels at Otakon.

302
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,724
Speaker 0: We plan on doing something else, but they haven't contacted us.

303
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:08,085
Speaker 1: Yeah.

304
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:08,708
Speaker 1: Yeah.

305
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,897
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm still.

306
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:13,563
Speaker 1: I still got to push him on that front, but Fill up a lot of space.

307
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:18,370
Speaker 1: if they said yes I'm gonna tell all of you because we're not gonna do it at this coming New York anime festival.

308
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,174
Speaker 1: But there's a good chance.

309
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:21,605
Speaker 1: We're going to do it at the next New York anime.

310
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:22,690
Speaker 0: really to New York.

311
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,577
Speaker 0: Okay festivals away.

312
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're already scheduling that one.

313
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:29,870
Speaker 0: I'd like to do it at Otakon, but I thought we were gonna do it at this coming in your gay festival.

314
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:33,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, they they have trouble getting enough space at that one.

315
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:38,129
Speaker 1: Uh-huh of all things We're gonna do like three or four panels at the upcoming one and that's it.

316
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:48,140
Speaker 1: But we basically offered to take over an entire room and schedule it for the entire con Start to finish all on our own and we had all the panels and all the staff lined up to do it.

317
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:58,170
Speaker 0: Yep, so, I don't know if that'll happen at Otakon But if they need help filling space, all they got to do is say yes, and we can make it happen.

318
00:22:59,217 --> 00:22:59,479
Speaker 0: They don't.

319
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:05,288
Speaker 0: just all you got to do is give us You know projector and a tech guy and some microphones and that's it.

320
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:09,490
Speaker 0: You're done You don't have to do any more work and you know, you can trust us cuz we're totally awesome.

321
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:10,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, nope.

322
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:12,138
Speaker 0: We've always done everything we said we do.

323
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:24,050
Speaker 1: I can't just indict Otakon though because more and more sadly The anime convention circuit does not I don't know accommodate us quite like the video game convention circuit does.

324
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:28,050
Speaker 0: Well, I think it just has to do with you know, the professionalism levels.

325
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:35,976
Speaker 1: Well, I think the sad truth is that the cons that are for-profit have a lot more resources to spend toward Accommodating the people who do events.

326
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:45,670
Speaker 0: I think it simply comes down to the fact right that Someone whose job it is to run a convention checks their email every day there because it's their work email, right?

327
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,690
Speaker 0: But someone who is doing a fan convention as opposed to a professional convention, right?

328
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:55,387
Speaker 0: It seems like these people just don't check and respond to their email.

329
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:57,453
Speaker 0: I mean You got her.

330
00:23:57,494 --> 00:24:00,970
Speaker 0: if you have email you must check it and respond to it at least once a day.

331
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:07,997
Speaker 0: If you are not that you are not a professional and if you have a responsibility associated with that email Then you have failed.

332
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:09,523
Speaker 1: do you want to be a professional?

333
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,736
Speaker 1: because as we learned in master Keaton Yeah You want to be a master.

334
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,710
Speaker 1: to become a professional is to sacrifice your humanity.

335
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:33,530
Speaker 0: Even if you are running like the rinky-dink local con in like the local community center That's like gonna be like for one day with like three rooms if you're not even the chair if you're just like running panels at that convention if There's an email address on their website that goes to you for panel information.

336
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:39,798
Speaker 0: You have to check that every day and respond to anything in there The day that it comes in or the day after.

337
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,889
Speaker 0: otherwise you have failed and it's you know.

338
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,844
Speaker 0: Big conventions are failing to do this and that is the number one problem.

339
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:48,430
Speaker 1: I'll break it down right now.

340
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,590
Speaker 0: Nothing else really matters except for the just the failure to email.

341
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:58,460
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna name names or anything but going down the list New York anime festival I get an email in like 12 hours from read.

342
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,399
Speaker 1: every time I correspond with them and look we're already scheduling The next two New York anime festivals for geek nights.

343
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,210

00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:16,807
Speaker 0: packs West is not read.

349
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:17,429

Speaker 0: packs West Petty arcade.

351
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:21,846
Speaker 1: Yes, but at the same time they respond immediately.

352
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:37,141
Speaker 1: Yep, Connecticut We we don't know we went from Theoretically being co-chairs of the panels department to having not been able to contact anyone on the staff For almost a year.

353
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:37,705
Speaker 0: Yep.

354
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:47,249
Speaker 1: I Worry, this is gonna be like last year where it literally we showed up at Connecticut Couldn't find anyone went in and just took badges from the badge room.

355
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:51,125
Speaker 1: We found a con schedule flipped through it and saw that sure enough.

356
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:55,045
Speaker 1: We had a panel scheduled And then went and did them on our own.

357
00:25:55,065 --> 00:26:02,890
Speaker 0: Yep It's not it was not the the experience we had at the first Connecticut At least the first one that we worked right because there was one that we just went to right.

358
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you know was they?

359
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,986
Speaker 0: we walked in they knew who we were.

360
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:11,633
Speaker 0: they gave us an itinerary Which still no other convention is done Right.

361
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:16,110
Speaker 0: That's one thing that that Connecticut on that particular year beats out every other convention ever.

362
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,299
Speaker 0: Wait, even the professional ones packs.

363
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:21,010
Speaker 1: However did give us a gigantic information package.

364
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,705
Speaker 0: They did but they didn't give us our personalized itinerary because we didn't need one.

365
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:25,829
Speaker 1: We were doing one event.

366
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,710
Speaker 0: I know that but I'm saying a personalized itinerary is like it's not awesome.

367
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:36,830
Speaker 1: But we were doing one event and we had the room for the entire hour before and the entire hour after to sort out.

368
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:39,299
Speaker 0: I know I'm just saying no one's done that.

369
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,082
Speaker 1: now they haven't.

370
00:26:40,243 --> 00:26:41,206
Speaker 0: I said that should be done.

371
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:42,090
Speaker 1: anime Boston.

372
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:47,904
Speaker 1: I've actually got a lot of communication But that's just because you know, we work directly with Lou as opposed

373
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:50,710
Speaker 0: to you know, see we are so he's yeah We didn't go to his email

374
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:54,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we kind of skipped a lot of their process and just worked with him directly and he responded like right away.

375
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:59,920
Speaker 1: So enemy Boston props Otakon, I haven't gotten much yet and I've emailed pretty much everyone.

376
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:02,450
Speaker 1: I know I'm trying not to bother the higher-level class.

377
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,880
Speaker 0: The thing is like you feel like emailing so much is bothering people But at the same time they're not responding and you need a response.

378
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:11,190
Speaker 0: So what can you do except email again?

379
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:11,751
Speaker 0: There's no.

380
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:14,222
Speaker 0: you have no other option because you basically email that.

381
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:15,990
Speaker 0: it went to a black hole and you got nothing back.

382
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:19,430
Speaker 0: So you have no choice but to email again or email a different person.

383
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:24,244
Speaker 1: Yep, actually of all things Tora Khan the small anime Khan at our IT.

384
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:25,688
Speaker 1: They responded immediately.

385
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:27,842
Speaker 1: all the time We were all set to go.

386
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:30,195
Speaker 0: people are technologically intelligent.

387
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:37,128
Speaker 1: we were all set to go and then I had to Regrettably cancel our appearance there because I'm going to be in Costa Rica for the entirety of torque on.

388
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:39,862
Speaker 1: well Oh, well, yeah, but we gave enough advanced.

389
00:27:39,882 --> 00:27:42,132
Speaker 0: I'm not really a big fan of going to Rochester It's all.

390
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:43,938
Speaker 1: I gave them a backup plan.

391
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,684
Speaker 1: So maybe Scott Johnson will run our panels.

392
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:47,610
Speaker 0: Oh Scott Johnson wants to go to Rochester.

393
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,212
Speaker 0: That's all him.

394
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:49,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, he'll probably go.

395
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:50,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

396
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,245
Speaker 1: I don't know what the status is.

397
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,875
Speaker 1: I worked I Extricated ourselves.

398
00:27:54,236 --> 00:27:55,903
Speaker 1: Hopefully we'll be at the Tora Khan in 2010.

399
00:27:55,903 --> 00:28:00,940
Speaker 0: Yeah I'll be ready to go to Rochester in 2010.

400
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,643
Speaker 1: I'd like to go back.

401
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:05,403
Speaker 1: I wanted to go back this year, but Costa Rica, how about 2020 Costa Rica?

402
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:16,449
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

403
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:18,457
Speaker 1: so what was my thing of the day?

404
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:21,168
Speaker 0: I kind of forgot All right, right, right, right.

405
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:24,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Scott's going out of town tonight.

406
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:36,957
Speaker 1: So I had to come up with the thing of the day real quick and I kind of randomly and Scott wandered in it Wanted to know how I found this and what I searched for but I'm not gonna reveal that.

407
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:44,136
Speaker 1: but I discovered Hatsune Miku singing the Israeli national anthem and the I don't know.

408
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:50,856
Speaker 1: it was pretty interesting to hear Vocaloid which forces you to sing in a crippling Japanese accent trying to pronounce Hebrew words.

409
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:51,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty good.

410
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,771
Speaker 0: There's a lot of sounds it can't make that it needs to make.

411
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:57,240
Speaker 1: yeah, Japan does not have that kind of sound.

412
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,143
Speaker 0: No, they don't have that sound.

413
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,637
Speaker 1: but then Scott said hey find the Italian one.

414
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:04,439
Speaker 0: That one's hilarious Really have like vah.

415
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:20,075
Speaker 1: So I searched through and I found this compilation of Hatsune Miku singing a whole bunch of national anthems and I got to say American not so great in Hatsune ease Italian great in any ease.

416
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:25,179
Speaker 1: Yes The Italian national anthem though doesn't quite beat the Russian national anthem.

417
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:27,068
Speaker 1: I don't know.

418
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:28,796
Speaker 1: There's something sorrowful about it.

419
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:29,479
Speaker 1: I love it.

420
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:38,280
Speaker 1: Oh Well, you know what nothing beats the one-piece national anthem in Italian.

421
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,847
Speaker 0: It's not a national anthem.

422
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:41,550
Speaker 0: It's just an opener.

423
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:43,359
Speaker 1: That should be the national anthem of Italy.

424
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,734
Speaker 0: No, the one they have is better.

425
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:46,380
Speaker 1: I don't know.

426
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:49,642
Speaker 0: All right.

427
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:50,969
Speaker 0: Anyway, okay.

428
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,034
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

429
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:56,408
Speaker 0: Oh, so I Couldn't find a thing of the day.

430
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:29,470
Speaker 0: So I went into an old Old place that used to get Wednesday things of the day from Japanese television and what I found was this comedian and he's doing sort of like this funny bit about you know, like taking a driving test right or driver's ed and You know, it's not Rakugo, but it is very Rakugo like in that, you know He's sitting in his little fake car and there's a screen and on the screen is showing you like what he sees out the windshield And he's sort of acting as if he's driving this car as

431
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:30,974
Speaker 1: I think I've seen this.

432
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:33,080
Speaker 0: all this stuff happens on the screen there.

433
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:35,800
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I've already seen this.

434
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,427
Speaker 1: I didn't know what Scott's thing of the day was.

435
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:38,652
Speaker 0: but have you seen it?

436
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:42,250
Speaker 0: because I just I just went to the TV in Japan and picked the funniest thing on the front page.

437
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,940
Speaker 1: I remember something just like this.

438
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,207
Speaker 1: I would think I watched it with Emily.

439
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:46,413
Speaker 0: that involve a Mario Kart.

440
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:47,097
Speaker 0: Yes.

441
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,766
Speaker 0: Yes That's what this is.

442
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:49,792
Speaker 0: All right.

443
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:50,698
Speaker 0: All right, it's okay.

444
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:53,889
Speaker 1: So, uh, it's kind of just wing this.

445
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,500
Speaker 1: I read all hail Megatron, okay.

446
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,360
Speaker 0: So so I was in a forum somewhere a comic book forum and I said everybody read Pokemon adventures.

447
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:09,335
Speaker 0: I'm not kidding Don't be pooing cuz it's Pokemon for serious.

448
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,279
Speaker 0: This is the real deal.

449
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:15,180
Speaker 0: So some guy was like I'll read Pokemon if you read all hail Megatron, right?

450
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,300
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I've read a few recent Transformers comics, right?

451
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:27,472
Speaker 0: You know cuz I like see I'm not like a huge transformers fan like oh my god transformers Oh my god, but you know, I kind of like transformers.

452
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,014
Speaker 0: They're cool.

453
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,118
Speaker 0: You know, they're robots.

454
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:30,677
Speaker 0: the transform It makes a fun toy.

455
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:33,909
Speaker 0: Optimus Prime is the man Decepticon.

456
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,320
Speaker 0: all the other Autobots are lame.

457
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:37,658
Speaker 0: Megatron is cool.

458
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,343
Speaker 1: Shockwave is the best Shockwave.

459
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:45,219
Speaker 0: Starscream is cool except he's nice and soundwave is also like the second best, you know.

460
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:48,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, shockwaves burden check waves burden.

461
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:53,599
Speaker 0: Come back here you bitches you can't aim for shit shockwave.

462
00:31:55,712 --> 00:32:06,397
Speaker 0: So You know, so I've read a few transformers comics I've read like transformers like generations or evolution or whatever that like where the like.

463
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:13,520
Speaker 0: they were all Steampunk II transformers and then I read like generation one, which is alright, you know.

464
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:32,920
Speaker 0: But they were all not bad But none of them were like good enough to where I wanted to read like a whole bunch more You know, it was like read the first volume be like, alright, it's transformers and then I'm done with it Right, and I've never found like an awesome Transformers comic that was so great that I wanted to just read it forever and ever until when it ended, right?

465
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,454
Speaker 1: They always seem to be either a fan service mashup of some kind.

466
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:38,040
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm or just fan service.

467
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:41,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, they just seem to be like retellings that are just.

468
00:32:41,574 --> 00:32:47,497
Speaker 0: they're not super awesome Retellings they're just you know, it's just like stuff in the transformers universe.

469
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:48,743
Speaker 0: That's it You know.

470
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:51,379
Speaker 0: the same as like GI Joe comics, you know, it's the same kind of stuff.

471
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,640
Speaker 0: so That he said read all hail Megatron.

472
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:58,269
Speaker 0: So the things I can tell already is number one.

473
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,888
Speaker 0: the concept is that the bad guys win which is you know, awesome Which interesting too because what are you gonna do with that?

474
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:07,339
Speaker 1: The Decepticons goals were kind of get energon.

475
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,466
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, all right.

476
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:09,798
Speaker 1: You've got it now what?

477
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:10,060
Speaker 1: yeah?

478
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:18,773
Speaker 0: And then second thing is I look I saw the cover of it and the cover was Awesome, like the cover art on this book is holy shit.

479
00:33:18,793 --> 00:33:20,258
Speaker 0: Remember a long time ago.

480
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,390
Speaker 0: There was a thing of the day It was like if the x-men looked like this.

481
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:27,656
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that was like oh my god I would read every issue of x-men.

482
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:32,595
Speaker 1: I Desperately want a large movie poster size just poster of that.

483
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:33,960
Speaker 0: So do a lot of people.

484
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:35,450
Speaker 1: I would pay a lot of money for that.

485
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,879
Speaker 0: I would pay like 50 bucks.

486
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,251
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the cover to this looked like that.

487
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:46,636
Speaker 0: so I was like, oh shit, so I'm like, all right I'll totally read that, you know, and you'll read the Pokemon.

488
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:47,219
Speaker 0: It'll be all good.

489
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:59,020
Speaker 0: So, you know the book shows up, you know, well actually I bought it in the complex store because I was in the city And I walked in the complex store and even though I don't like to buy stuff in the complex store because a lot of money.

490
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:02,679
Speaker 0: I feel bad standing in there for like a half hour and I'm not buying anything.

491
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:07,477
Speaker 0: So I bought it because I had to you know wanted to read it anyway and I agreed to read it.

492
00:34:07,618 --> 00:34:13,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, and You know, it was sort of the same as the other transformers books I read.

493
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:15,052
Speaker 0: it was good, but it wasn't anything.

494
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:16,418
Speaker 0: I want to read some more of it.

495
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,760
Speaker 1: Just it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere interesting.

496
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,120
Speaker 1: Good guys are gonna win in the end after the bad guys won in the beginning.

497
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:30,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, like all the characters are kind of the same static transformers archtypes Megatron and Starscream have the same conversation like three times.

498
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:33,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Thing it has.

499
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:46,440
Speaker 0: what the book has right is first of all It sort of has a lot of balls to have the Decepticons just fucking like, you know Kill a whole bunch of people all over the place Like they smash Times Square, right?

500
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,120
Speaker 0: And the other thing it has is lots of like these cool scenes.

501
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:03,214
Speaker 0: Like there's a scene where there's modern f-22 Raptors with human pilots in them against the f-15s of the Decepticons, right and they're like F-15s, you know, oh my god, and you know, it's.

502
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:04,340
Speaker 0: it's like, oh, it's cool.

503
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:12,367
Speaker 0: But then is another cool part where people are hiding in a subway station and then the trains coming and like oh We're saved the trains coming.

504
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:24,579
Speaker 0: Oh shit the train transform And this cool stuff like that, right but Cool scenes and sort of those are sort of fan service.

505
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,998
Speaker 0: he scenes also right are not enough to you know, make an entire book.

506
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:41,739
Speaker 0: and I think the thing that really bothered me the most was that You know, it's like you knew the bad guys were sort of coming back, you know It wasn't like it should have been right the bad guys.

507
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:45,880
Speaker 0: They should have started like they started with the bad guys winning already, right?

508
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,349
Speaker 0: I think they should have started before the bad guys had won.

509
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,264
Speaker 0: then have the bad guys win and then have that be the end I would have.

510
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,011
Speaker 0: I would have liked that a lot more then to see.

511
00:35:56,212 --> 00:36:00,649
Speaker 1: I think the problem is that marketing was The concept is the Decepticons won.

512
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:07,480
Speaker 1: if they start a regular story and then the Decepticons win People are gonna go rabble rabble rabble and they're not gonna buy it for the concept.

513
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,117
Speaker 1: Only the existing fans will just buy it because it's another thing.

514
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:18,020
Speaker 0: Maybe that's my old thing is they could have called it all hell Megatron and still had you know some I don't know.

515
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,902
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I guess what?

516
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:34,271
Speaker 1: Yeah, what really bothers me is that for a brief moment when I was reading it I thought hey Maybe they're gonna do something cool and meta because the Decepticons goals were kind of stupid and Maybe they were gonna mean they didn't really have goals.

517
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:36,659
Speaker 0: It was always just good guys for his bad guys.

518
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:37,984
Speaker 0: I want power.

519
00:36:38,004 --> 00:36:39,990
Speaker 0: We want a rule Cybertron.

520
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,235
Speaker 0: We want energon.

521
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:41,937
Speaker 1: That's the point.

522
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:43,705
Speaker 0: We hate Autobots We hate December.

523
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:46,440
Speaker 1: maybe what I thought maybe what they're gonna do is all right.

524
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:53,020
Speaker 1: We have these stupid, you know 90s cartoon bad guys with you know, these blame goals.

525
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:58,942
Speaker 1: What if we make them win and then explore the fact that they didn't really have any goals, you know What now?

526
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,527
Speaker 1: you've conquered the world Megatron.

527
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,049
Speaker 1: what now?

528
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:09,733
Speaker 1: and maybe you could have ended with Megatron and one by one murdering all the Decepticons Because they always needs more ruins the world, you know ending alone on some destroyed planet.

529
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:19,840
Speaker 1: Look ye mighty style, but instead Nothing interesting happens and Starscream and Megatron have these pseudo philosophical crap discussions over and over again that don't go anywhere.

530
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:24,453
Speaker 1: Clearly Starscream is gonna betray Megatron at some point clearly the bet.

531
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:26,840
Speaker 0: and the thing is it's so obvious that the bad guy.

532
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,280
Speaker 0: You know the good guys, you know our cons are slowly building up to fixing everything.

533
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,340
Speaker 1: You know the bad guys won and the whole comic was their decline and then it didn't end with the good guys winning.

534
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,693
Speaker 1: But if ended with just everyone losing that would have been great.

535
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:43,315
Speaker 0: Oh that would.

536
00:37:43,336 --> 00:37:44,460
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz right now, right?

537
00:37:44,520 --> 00:38:05,079
Speaker 0: It's like the Autobots are on Cybertron and you're constantly seeing them You know struggling with each other struggling to survive Struggling to make a comeback and you're also seeing you know The humans struggling to to rise up and do anything because they're totally powerless right again in the face of you know Decepticons without you know having Autobots to help them fight them.

538
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:10,900
Speaker 0: So but you see like, you know, they develop a technology and they go to deploy it, but they get smashed.

539
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:15,034
Speaker 0: But one guy doesn't drown and there he is with the secret weapon.

540
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,458
Speaker 0: He's gonna do it on his own.

541
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:18,049
Speaker 1: awesome I would just love to see that.

542
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:18,836
Speaker 1: There's no chance.

543
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:22,618
Speaker 1: the good guys Oh, yeah, and they don't win and then watch the bed actually would like to see.

544
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:28,136
Speaker 0: You know, like all the Autobots just kill them all just but not end of the Autobots.

545
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:28,457
Speaker 0: No more.

546
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:29,019
Speaker 0: That's it.

547
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,384
Speaker 1: Tamino didn't direct this.

548
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:30,746
Speaker 1: What do you?

549
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,239
Speaker 0: I know but that would have been totally like just blow up all of Cybertron.

550
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:35,474
Speaker 0: Boom It's all gone.

551
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:40,455
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Cuz like look they got they got they got Optimus Prime sitting there.

552
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:42,100
Speaker 0: He's all broken, of course, right?

553
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,860
Speaker 0: But then you know, he's gonna wake up like at the end and be all awesome.

554
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:50,440
Speaker 0: Better if he was actually completely broken give me that fucking matrix back.

555
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:57,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's also some allusions to an Autobot traitor, which I think is Rodimus, but I'm not sure but that's what it seems to me.

556
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,110
Speaker 0: It's so like it's so lame ham-fisted.

557
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,780
Speaker 0: You know, it's not it's not smooth and deadly.

558
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:12,980
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe if the traitor were optimist and he had some sort of I don't want to bring him back at the end and then he turns around and helps Megatron and the bad guys win for reals.

559
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:15,407
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe a betrayal.

560
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:23,980
Speaker 1: I don't want to spoil other works we have read and watch and talk about but Optimus Trump Prime being the betrayer would harken to a lot of greater works.

561
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is that in this first volume they didn't get.

562
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:35,999
Speaker 0: you know Even if there is some sort of redemption in the later volume There wasn't enough in the first volume to where I'm gonna get any more, you know.

563
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:45,829
Speaker 0: But what it was I guess despite all these that you know Criticisms I have of it It's probably one of the best transformers comics I've read.

564
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:48,076
Speaker 0: because transformers comics really aren't.

565
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,280
Speaker 0: you know what I mean?

566
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:55,232
Speaker 0: There are lots and lots of good Transformers comics just plain old good average middle-of-the-road.

567
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:58,140
Speaker 0: There are none that I can think of that are great.

568
00:39:58,684 --> 00:39:59,954
Speaker 0: You know me which one is great.

569
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,723
Speaker 0: Oh Right.

570
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:03,688
Speaker 0: I mean even the original ones aren't great.

571
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:08,520
Speaker 0: So this one is a little bit better than good, right?

572
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:11,420
Speaker 0: So it's probably the best transformers comic.

573
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:16,320
Speaker 0: If you really want to read a transformers comic book, this one is not bad.

574
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,432
Speaker 1: But I think we should talk about something a little bit better.

575
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:20,995
Speaker 0: Yeah.

576
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:22,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's talk about good stuff All right.

577
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:31,429
Speaker 1: so of course we're gonna do a show on this but I figure it's worth pointing out now because if you're looking for something to Read you should be reading 20th Century Boys.

578
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:48,283
Speaker 0: Well, yeah pretty much what's happened here, right is Monster finished publishing in the United States, right and I've bought most of it Like I only had two volumes of it but then I recently acquired all the remaining volumes except I'm still missing like 10 and 12 and I'm waiting for them to send them to me.

579
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:59,300
Speaker 0: but They've also as a result because monster is finished publishing Viz is now bringing out both Pluto and 20th Century Boys, you know in English.

580
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:06,760
Speaker 0: So every month this year, you're either gonna see a new volume of Pluto or a new volume of 20th Century Boys on the shelves.

581
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:08,724
Speaker 0: So this is really.

582
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:12,554
Speaker 0: it's gonna be the year of Naoki Urasawa in America.

583
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:14,780
Speaker 0: There is you know, there's no question about it.

584
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,620
Speaker 0: I mean the Eisner nominees just came out and I'll probably use that as my news next week once you know.

585
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:24,528
Speaker 0: There's some more discussion and I know what more the books are and monster is on.

586
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:28,405
Speaker 0: there is like best continuing series of 08 right.

587
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:32,085
Speaker 0: So, you know, this is a Year of Urasawa.

588
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:33,671
Speaker 0: So we already did a whole show on Pluto.

589
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:33,912
Speaker 0: Right?

590
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:38,063
Speaker 0: So 20th Century Boys is Also the business.

591
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:45,405
Speaker 1: I don't think we should like really say anything about what it's about other than it is a Naoki Urasawa Manga.

592
00:41:45,426 --> 00:41:45,506
Speaker 0: Yeah.

593
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:54,000
Speaker 0: Well, I think when you all that that entails I think we do have to know about it, right and this is this is basically the only way to summarize the plot without spoiling anything right is?

594
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:57,700
Speaker 0: It's a story that just you know, the the jumps around in time.

595
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,597
Speaker 0: So they'll show you the the end the beginning the middle, right?

596
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:07,937
Speaker 0: It's not Chronologically told and it's a story about these a group of Japanese dudes who are all friends.

597
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:21,360
Speaker 0: when they were little kids You know, they had like a little club when they were kids, you know sort of like a Boy Scout Sandlot kind of club and somehow it is heavily alluded to that later on in life.

598
00:42:22,023 --> 00:42:33,185
Speaker 0: They save the world like for reals and Possibly through rock and roll possibly through rock and roll or maybe From giant robots.

599
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,168
Speaker 0: who the fuck knows?

600
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,094
Speaker 0: it's totally mysterious.

601
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:40,087
Speaker 0: and you know, Urasawa He is the master of suspense.

602
00:42:40,148 --> 00:42:43,920
Speaker 0: There is no questioning that but it jumps around in time.

603
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:48,040
Speaker 0: Well, because it didn't jump around in time all the secrets would be revealed.

604
00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:52,438
Speaker 1: Here's the thing it jumps around in time but not in context.

605
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:52,920
Speaker 1: is the way?

606
00:42:53,622 --> 00:42:57,412
Speaker 1: Yes, the context of the narrative is all like throughout.

607
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:02,619
Speaker 1: an entire scene will always be the same But yet it jumps to different times.

608
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:10,499
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's showing you how the thing that happened when they were kids relates to the thing that happened when they were middle-aged Relates to the thing that happened in the future, you know

609
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:17,507
Speaker 1: The way it's done is very novel and it this is the one of the most compelling manga I have picked up in a long time.

610
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:18,170
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

611
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,520
Speaker 0: Like, you know, I mean Urasawa stuff is pretty great.

612
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Speaker 0: You know the master Keaton and the the fashionable judo girl and the monster, right?

613
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,741
Speaker 0: But you read more and more of his stuff Pluto 20th century boys, and he is not the one-trick pony I mean.

614
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:38,824
Speaker 0: sure everything he does is always very suspenseful and has the same high quality to it But is not?

615
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:41,540
Speaker 0: he's not doing the same thing over and over again.

616
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,652
Speaker 0: You know, he every manga is different yet.

617
00:43:43,813 --> 00:43:45,120
Speaker 0: Every manga is also great.

618
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,692
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean monster is a every up every volume you go.

619
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:49,535
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

620
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:55,297
Speaker 1: Oh shit Yeah, and 20th century boys is just more of a. I don't want to say anything else about it.

621
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:57,183
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you should be.

622
00:43:57,203 --> 00:44:02,400
Speaker 0: you should be picking up all these urasawa things every month if you're a human being.

623
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:09,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus I just a little while ago read Pluto - Wow I am digging that.

624
00:44:09,593 --> 00:44:18,085
Speaker 1: I Don't know if my favorite character is the one I don't know anything about yet or the other one I don't know anything about yet or Maybe Hannibal.

625
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I like Hannibal the most.

626
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:23,487
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is about him.

627
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:24,188
Speaker 0: I don't know.

628
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,976
Speaker 0: I would like a photo if he was there.

629
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:29,598
Speaker 0: I Haven't seen photo yet.

630
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:39,168
Speaker 1: I Think something cool is gonna happen with photo so far if there is a photo so far every time a new character is revealed In the next volume there's two volumes.

631
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:40,653
Speaker 1: obviously so far that we have.

632
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, something cool happens with that character.

633
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:44,845
Speaker 0: Yep, so we'll see.

634
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:49,016
Speaker 1: We will see plus the context of what happened in the astro boy.

635
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:51,927
Speaker 1: I Speculate and I don't know.

636
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:54,960
Speaker 0: I think that it'll stay true to the original.

637
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,357
Speaker 1: I think it will too and it amazes me like to a degree that you don't really.

638
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:08,280
Speaker 1: you can't really comprehend That urasawa was able to take the story of that astro boy and turn it into this While at the same same time being painfully faithful.

639
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:21,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean think of you take like was really, you know a great story but not a very complex or deep or fleshed-out story a very sort of skeletal story and Filling it in so amazingly.

640
00:45:21,315 --> 00:45:24,606
Speaker 0: yet Still, you know, I don't know.

641
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:26,613
Speaker 0: Naroki Urasawa is a genius.

642
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:28,680
Speaker 0: People need to do that with other things.

643
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:33,717
Speaker 0: You know like other, you know, really sort of like, you know bare-bones stories.

644
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:37,388
Speaker 1: take like The transformers and make a good manga.

645
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:43,296
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, just fill in all the blanks in the transformers to make it good Yeah, all right.

646
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,773
Speaker 1: Yeah We've actually talked quite a while we should talk about.

647
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:47,579
Speaker 1: I think one more thing.

648
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:51,546
Speaker 0: I don't you know a bunch of quickies All right Do you want to talk about some of the?

649
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:52,531
Speaker 0: it's a new anime season.

650
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:54,380
Speaker 0: you want to talk quickly about some of the animes we?

651
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,564
Speaker 0: Watched that are new.

652
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:56,828
Speaker 1: Well, there's that joke show.

653
00:45:57,531 --> 00:45:58,896
Speaker 0: All right, so there's a show.

654
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,040
Speaker 0: What's it called?

655
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,605
Speaker 0: Charities daily joke or something.

656
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:04,430
Speaker 1: It's just a joke.

657
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically they're gonna make 365 episodes.

658
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,240
Speaker 0: They're all really short and each episode is just telling you a joke.

659
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:13,303
Speaker 0: That's it And they're all.

660
00:46:13,323 --> 00:46:16,120
Speaker 0: it's just a little animated joke and that that's all there is to it.

661
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:23,419
Speaker 0: The first one was hilarious the second one not as hilarious And I've got like three more so we'll check those out.

662
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,472
Speaker 1: The the thing that will tantalize you is that the watch the first episode.

663
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,700
Speaker 1: they're so short you can always just watch it.

664
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,993
Speaker 0: You're gonna spend as much time if you watch.

665
00:46:33,013 --> 00:46:34,560
Speaker 0: let's say you wanted to watch all these in a row.

666
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:41,880
Speaker 0: The openers and closers would take a significant percentage of the time perhaps more than oh my god Remember when we marathon for the anime?

667
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,656
Speaker 1: Risky safety and we showed the opener and the closer with the Eiffel Tower every time.

668
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:48,700
Speaker 0: or is it the Tokyo Tower?

669
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,165
Speaker 1: I think it's the Tokyo Tower.

670
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:50,607
Speaker 0: I don't know.

671
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:52,035
Speaker 1: Anyway, I barely remember.

672
00:46:52,075 --> 00:47:01,160
Speaker 1: I kind of like that show But it was cute the openers and closers Or longer than the show and it became I don't know became this kind of epic memory of the anime club.

673
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:05,454
Speaker 0: Risky always reminded me of a kamako kamako.

674
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:14,659
Speaker 1: Okay, but if you watch the first one of these jokes You'll see what kinds of jokes these are and then you'll realize why we like it.

675
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:21,792
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm probably gonna just watch these into in as long as they're funny often enough I'll just watch them all cuz they're so short.

676
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,679
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt, right?

677
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:24,508
Speaker 0: What else do we watch?

678
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:30,528
Speaker 1: we saw the first episode of cayenne which is the Newest moe show that isn't also perverted.

679
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:30,809
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,913
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny.

681
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:33,739
Speaker 0: It's like I started notice something.

682
00:47:34,782 --> 00:47:38,271
Speaker 0: There are shows out there that are actually like total moe, right?

683
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:40,337
Speaker 0: They're nothing but moe like.

684
00:47:40,477 --> 00:47:41,360
Speaker 0: what was that one?

685
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,305
Speaker 0: Charcoal tan or whatever.

686
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:45,252
Speaker 1: I've been show time in show time.

687
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:46,034
Speaker 1: Nothing but moe.

688
00:47:46,095 --> 00:47:47,580
Speaker 1: that show was just yay.

689
00:47:47,761 --> 00:47:48,384
Speaker 1: I woke up.

690
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:50,573
Speaker 1: look at the Ducks penny shot.

691
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:51,578
Speaker 1: I don't think there was actually no.

692
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:56,099
Speaker 0: no But it was just moe right and or really fairies, right?

693
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,267
Speaker 0: And the thing is those shows.

694
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,800
Speaker 0: if you haven't noticed they're not very popular, right?

695
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,894
Speaker 0: I mean been show time is not huge popular as far as I can tell.

696
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:04,577
Speaker 0: I might be wrong.

697
00:48:04,638 --> 00:48:14,917
Speaker 0: Correct me But the shows that are popular that are also moe They also have another element usually a comedic element.

698
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:27,030
Speaker 0: For example Chobits has or you know, it's it's moe but like half the show is comedy and half the show is moe or Kayon half the show is comedy.

699
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,119
Speaker 0: It was a four panel gag comic, right?

700
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:31,546
Speaker 0: You know Haru he it's.

701
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:39,320
Speaker 0: you know, there's some moe in there, but there's also something else And I think what it is is that these shows it's the something else in them.

702
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,407
Speaker 0: That is the popular part and they just happen to have moe Which you know isn't hurting.

703
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,213
Speaker 0: lucky star was primarily a comedy.

704
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:47,494
Speaker 0: right.

705
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:52,753
Speaker 0: and look at the other shows That are that are popular in other sort of anime genres, right?

706
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:54,440
Speaker 0: Look at the robot shows that are popular.

707
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:55,964
Speaker 0: It's not the robot shows.

708
00:48:56,225 --> 00:49:06,440
Speaker 0: the robot shows that are just robot shows are not very popular except among the robot fans Just like the moe shows that are just moe shows aren't popular unless it's with the moe fans.

709
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:09,128
Speaker 0: It's the robot shows that are also something else.

710
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:11,215
Speaker 0: big O also something else.

711
00:49:11,275 --> 00:49:13,481
Speaker 0: Gundam seed also something else Right.

712
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:18,060
Speaker 0: Those are the robot shows that get popular because they're more than just a robot show.

713
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:27,981
Speaker 0: They're a. you know, there's something else going on there and I think that You know, we look we tend to look at an anime and look at its visual Genre.

714
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:31,612
Speaker 0: we pigeonhole it based on what it looks like immediately more.

715
00:49:31,672 --> 00:49:33,819
Speaker 0: So you well, you know, but that's what you got to do.

716
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,972
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the same time like look at princess tutu at first glance.

717
00:49:38,012 --> 00:49:39,396
Speaker 1: That is a moe craft show.

718
00:49:39,496 --> 00:49:40,359
Speaker 0: It's not moe at all.

719
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:42,524
Speaker 1: It's got a bit of that.

720
00:49:42,544 --> 00:49:43,147
Speaker 1: it's a kids show.

721
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:45,176
Speaker 0: yeah, look it's a magical girl show.

722
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:45,980
Speaker 0: it's not a boy show.

723
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there are moe elements there.

724
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:49,279
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

725
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:53,378
Speaker 1: I think the the clumsiness and the way she is portrayed early on.

726
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:56,269
Speaker 1: if you just Took some stills from that and showed it to people.

727
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,100
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people would say oh some motion.

728
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:00,413
Speaker 0: I think it's magical girl.

729
00:50:00,453 --> 00:50:01,120
Speaker 0: I don't think it's moe.

730
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:05,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm talking like just look at the art and take a bunch of stills.

731
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:07,252
Speaker 0: at the main counter The art looks like magical girl art.

732
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:09,349
Speaker 1: I Disagree watch Sailor Moon.

733
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:10,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't look anything like that anyway.

734
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:20,492
Speaker 0: The point is is that you know K on I mean, you know, it's not the worst thing ever But it's not like I want to watch all the episodes either.

735
00:50:20,532 --> 00:50:21,900
Speaker 0: You know, it's the first one.

736
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:22,564
Speaker 0: It's sort of like.

737
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:24,295
Speaker 0: it's so formulaic.

738
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:25,140
Speaker 0: I see what's gonna happen.

739
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:31,634
Speaker 0: So I just kind of I kind of want to watch like the last few episodes Just to see the outcome that I expect and that'll be enough for me.

740
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:33,280
Speaker 1: See I actually I kind of enjoyed it.

741
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,813
Speaker 1: I'll probably watch it idly and as long as it stays good.

742
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:37,020
Speaker 1: I'll probably watch all of it.

743
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:46,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if I was gonna watch a show along those lines I would go back and finish watching The one where the girl was like interfering code.

744
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:48,913
Speaker 0: What was it?

745
00:50:49,901 --> 00:50:51,670
Speaker 0: Was it code something Cody Cody?

746
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:53,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good show.

747
00:50:53,278 --> 00:50:57,499
Speaker 0: Yeah I only watched a few episodes of that and I could I got I think I got a lot more of them.

748
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:58,403
Speaker 0: and there was Another season.

749
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:02,120
Speaker 0: there was like code each something else or code G or code F?

750
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,996
Speaker 0: I don't remember but I'd watch that before I watched Kayon cuz.

751
00:51:06,016 --> 00:51:06,418
Speaker 0: that had a.

752
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,419
Speaker 1: I know I think Kayon had had enough subtle and actually funny humor in it.

753
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:15,051
Speaker 0: And you know, of course, I didn't laugh too much compared to.

754
00:51:15,453 --> 00:51:16,236
Speaker 0: I mean it started.

755
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,500
Speaker 0: the episode started with the toast.

756
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,167
Speaker 0: It was just like toast.

757
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,775
Speaker 0: really I can.

758
00:51:20,795 --> 00:51:21,820
Speaker 1: I can be down with the toast.

759
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:24,640
Speaker 1: I'll admit I kind of like the aesthetic of the toast.

760
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:25,327
Speaker 0: I can't.

761
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:26,620
Speaker 0: I like the aesthetic of the toast.

762
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:29,620
Speaker 0: But once you do when you actually do the toast, it's like how can I respect you?

763
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,200
Speaker 1: But unless I mean you could do the toast in the lame way, but if you go with the toast.

764
00:51:34,421 --> 00:51:35,774
Speaker 0: But they didn't really go with the toast.

765
00:51:35,814 --> 00:51:36,380
Speaker 0: It was just there.

766
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,531
Speaker 0: They didn't go full-on hardcore with the toast like they could have.

767
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:41,900
Speaker 1: I think they went on with the toast in this cut.

768
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,720
Speaker 1: I think it was a self-referencing.

769
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:45,666
Speaker 0: I was making a moe show.

770
00:51:45,706 --> 00:51:50,040
Speaker 0: right the show would open with the toast right and the toast would be big like you would see.

771
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:55,480
Speaker 0: Like the show would start looking at the toaster the toast would come out the hand would grab it.

772
00:51:55,701 --> 00:52:03,280
Speaker 0: You would see, you know, you would zoom in on the toast as it was dangling from the mouth as they run out You know to the street on the bicycle.

773
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:11,795
Speaker 0: You'd get the side shot of the toast swinging back and forth and then for the funny joke Sitting in the classroom with the toast still in the mouth.

774
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:15,598
Speaker 0: That'll be my boy show Like that.

775
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:20,500
Speaker 1: But one thing I can say high production values compared to most of the rest of the stuff we watched.

776
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:23,534
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, because it's you know, it's actually a money-making kind of show.

777
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:24,680
Speaker 0: It's you know big monies.

778
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:27,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, we watched a little bit of a porphy's tedious journey.

779
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,874
Speaker 0: I was porphy's tedious journey.

780
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:35,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, we watched a little bit of What was the one that was the school city?

781
00:52:35,173 --> 00:52:41,152
Speaker 0: Oh Valenoir, right, so I downloaded something called school city Valenoir.

782
00:52:41,193 --> 00:52:42,838
Speaker 1: You should just let that one be for now.

783
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,047
Speaker 1: All right I think I think you should all watch it.

784
00:52:46,308 --> 00:52:52,533
Speaker 1: No, and yes, and I Think that deserves a show.

785
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:53,519
Speaker 1: a Dave and Joe Ling.

786
00:52:55,723 --> 00:52:57,399
Speaker 0: There are a few other little things we watch.

787
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:01,029
Speaker 0: None of them were particularly exciting and nothing stood out.

788
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,575
Speaker 1: a couple of shown in fighting shows.

789
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:03,660
Speaker 1: a couple of shows that just didn't.

790

Speaker 0: Yeah, there was one.

791
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,306
Speaker 0: It was sort of a normal showed in fighting show.

792
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:10,259
Speaker 0: another one was like a sort of a school show with a ghost.

793
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:15,960
Speaker 0: Another show was sort of a kiddie fighting show and none of them really stood out at all.

794
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,497
Speaker 0: Another one was at the samurai show right the eggs, whatever.

795
00:53:20,517 --> 00:53:21,340
Speaker 0: It was not exciting.

796
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,605
Speaker 1: I don't know.

797
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:26,118
Speaker 1: that guy was pretty big and the way he passed out in that boat.

798
00:53:26,158 --> 00:53:32,260
Speaker 1: I kind of liked Yeah, but other than that that that show could be worth a lampooning at best.

799
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:36,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're still waiting, you know to see what the good stuff is this season.
