1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,945
Speaker 1: It's Thursday April 22nd 2021.

2
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:10,346
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,352
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:17,058
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about pets.

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:19,398
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:31,671
Speaker 1: so, uh the Rangers according to I typed Rangers odds of playoffs into Google really low because After the gate the game maybe one four in a row.

7
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:40,740
Speaker 0: the Bruins also won four in a row suiting catch up to them Lose some games that were the elders fell back But then they just beat the shit out of us to create a bigger gap.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,417
Speaker 0: So now not only and the Bruins won again, so it's like not only the gap got bigger Yeah, and we haven't caught up to anybody.

9
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:47,840
Speaker 0: even worse.

10
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:55,294
Speaker 1: I looked at the schedule because some teams got better or worse at different parts of the season But the Bruins actually have a pretty easy schedule for the rest of the year.

11
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:57,884
Speaker 1: the way things are going right now Games remain.

12
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:00,534
Speaker 0: it's the grab is the most important thing.

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,120
Speaker 0: the games remaining against Buffalo.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, the grab is the stat.

15
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:07,038
Speaker 1: then of course we uh, we notably lost a buffalo earlier.

16
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:08,883
Speaker 0: So One time.

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was yeah.

18
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:15,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if that doesn't happen again, cuz that could be a problem Oh, it was OT loss wasn't OT law.

19
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:20,820
Speaker 1: So we got that point but I did Check because the odds were a lot higher before the game.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,996
Speaker 1: We just lost and then they dropped on the on the tee.

21
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,533
Speaker 1: on the TV They said they have a seven point five percent chance of winning based on some bookie.

22
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,660
Speaker 1: So making it into the playoffs.

23
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:41,968
Speaker 1: So according to Google as of right now Based on games that happened in the intervening period from the last time we checked that their odds have risen to a sparkling 8.1 percent chance.

24
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:49,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, so either roll a natural 20 or roll a 19 and then get lucky like that's.

25
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,740
Speaker 1: that's the odds of the Rangers making the playoffs.

26
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:53,747
Speaker 0: Not good odds not great.

27
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,429
Speaker 1: Ah, that's fine.

28
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:55,272
Speaker 0: That's fine.

29
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:57,400
Speaker 0: Well, just you know, we weren't expected to make the play.

30
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,310
Speaker 1: There won't be hockey and it'll be warmer and then we'll continue.

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,120
Speaker 1: we'll finish reading the tale of Genji instead of watching hockey.

32
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:04,183
Speaker 0: Sure.

33
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:11,910
Speaker 1: I I did turn off that game the other night And I was just like fart noise.

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,633
Speaker 1: nice, you know what I did.

35
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:14,620
Speaker 1: instead I played kid Icarus on the NES.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,325
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm fighting.

37
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,673
Speaker 1: actually I made it pretty far.

38
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:22,364
Speaker 1: I'm way better at that game than I was as a kid I can only get.

39
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:29,339
Speaker 0: I've only ever like playing honestly without passwords or anything, you know I've only ever gotten past like the first vertical level.

40
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:34,540
Speaker 1: I've gotten to the to the end of the first dungeon and beaten it legit on a real NES as a kid.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,205
Speaker 1: But I really couldn't get beyond that without codes.

42
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:42,787
Speaker 1: I am using save states now, but I'm not doing any other cheating Like I'm just figuring the game out Dave states.

43
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:49,506
Speaker 0: Oh, you're already just I'm doing the biggest possible cheating, but no other - yeah It means it's the best.

44
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:53,120
Speaker 1: most perfect realization of me is what is me is playing this game.

45
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got a. I've got a motor in my bicycle that's hidden but no other cheating.

46
00:02:58,818 --> 00:02:59,781
Speaker 0: that's the only cheating I'm doing.

47
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:04,620
Speaker 1: thing is what I will say playing kid Icarus without that is an exercise in misery.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,243
Speaker 1: Fuck that game.

49
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:12,193
Speaker 1: playing it just with save states is actually Way better and more fun than I expected.

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:17,460
Speaker 1: because I hated that game so much I never tried this before on an emulator to actually like try to beat kid Icarus.

51
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:40,603
Speaker 1: So anyway in some news and this is actually moderately big news that I wish the u.s would emulate France This month has voted to ban any flights Where there is a train that could do the same route that is active and available to the public it within a certain amount of time Just straight up.

52
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:46,559
Speaker 1: So right now currently it's going to ban five routes, which might not sound like a lot.

53
00:03:46,619 --> 00:04:03,719
Speaker 1: but to analogize this for you us ians Despite the fact that there's like a two ish hour Amtrak to Boston or DC from New York City like it's a real short Amtrak a Terrifying number of flights go between New York City Boston and DC on a daily basis.

54
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:12,203
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like that, you know, the train is a little bit slower than the plane, but no TSA Don't.

55
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,539
Speaker 1: yeah, there's no takes to get to the airport.

56
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:27,595
Speaker 0: Right, exactly the you know, the train has some advantages and it's sort of evens out for those For those trips a little bit But also that they evens out for those trips in America where Amtrak sucks in France.

57
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,940
Speaker 1: The trains are pretty good.

58
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:34,961
Speaker 0: Yeah If that if that was a bullet train that went from New York to Boston the the plane would make no sense What?

59
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,233
Speaker 0: so the worst part is it would carry less people in less time.

60
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,000
Speaker 1: It actually kind of is a bullet train.

61
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:41,360
Speaker 1: What one thing people always forget?

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,753
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about psychicness before the Acela.

63
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:52,070
Speaker 1: like the fast train Everyone makes fun of in America the Amtrak because it's so slow That train is actually a bullet train and can go very very fast.

64
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,280
Speaker 0: However, technically it's like yeah sure what you know some semantic meaning.

65
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Speaker 1: Well, the word bullet does go that fast for short segments.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,900
Speaker 1: The sole reason though that route in America is so slow is because they have to redo all the tracks that have really tight turns.

67
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,941
Speaker 1: Right, they can't compare.

68
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:09,323
Speaker 1: it does.

69
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:27,800
Speaker 0: when I when I say bullet train I mean the real bullet trains not in the Semantic, you know, no true Scotsman sense but in the sense that on the other side of the world there are trains that go 400 500 kilometers an hour and the Accela isn't even close.

70
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:31,914
Speaker 0: Right, if you put the Accela next to that in a race, it would look like a snail.

71
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,740
Speaker 1: They also serve different purposes.

72
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,750
Speaker 1: Those super fast trains actually cover much longer distances and The Shinkansen in Japan.

73
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,420
Speaker 0: It depends what those aren't the fastest.

74
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:44,806
Speaker 0: They're not.

75
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:54,337
Speaker 0: they are not the fastest but they are still several times faster than the Accela and Japan as a country is about the size of California.

76
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,542
Speaker 0: ish Yeah, right.

77
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:56,847
Speaker 0: so you could think of the.

78
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:03,519
Speaker 0: it is making a trip from like, you know, LA to San Diego Which isn't too different from I'd say a Boston New York trip, right?

79
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:10,040
Speaker 1: The point is simply this those trains that trip would be shockingly short even with our existing technology.

80
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:19,260
Speaker 1: The sole barrier to that is the tracks themselves That NIMBYs won't allow anyone to upgrade and no government entity is willing to fund.

81
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:27,100
Speaker 1: But even now with the current shitty Accela, I still think the US should ban flights between New York and Boston.

82
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:28,270
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm 100% agreement.

83
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:29,681
Speaker 0: So

84
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:55,980
Speaker 1: in Paris, like this is a big step of Paris to a Bordeaux to Lyon to Nantes to Rennes and to Marseille are just banned and It seems like the evidence is this will have a world impacting Decrease in carbon dioxide emissions like it is a sea like it's not like enough to change our trajectory But it's like a measurable noticeable amount of reduction by not having those flights.

85
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,680
Speaker 1: Mmm, and actually the rule is pretty good too.

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,795
Speaker 1: The rule is if there if there's a train route that is 2.5 hours or less.

87
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:06,600
Speaker 1: That is the trigger that will ban flights.

88
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,910
Speaker 0: So the Accela time from New York to Boston is about three hours and change.

89
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, the last I read if they fix the tracks, it would be a little under two hours.

90
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,815
Speaker 0: So it'd be like seven.

91
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:24,637
Speaker 0: it takes you.

92
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,821
Speaker 0: if you leave at 7 p.m.

93
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:27,485
Speaker 0: Today you'll get there at 1048 p.m.

94
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:27,646
Speaker 0: Right?

95
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,304
Speaker 0: If the Shinkansen can go 320 kilometer running at speeds and actually runs at speeds of 320 kilometers an hour.

96
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:44,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it from New York to Boston is 346 kilometers, it would probably get there in an hour and change.

97
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, so even the Accela with fixed tracks, right is Well, the Accela with fixed tracks is almost an hour slower.

98
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:57,140
Speaker 0: Well, actually the Accela could go in, which is not fastest train on earth.

99
00:07:57,582 --> 00:08:00,820
Speaker 0: So if you had the fastest train on earth, you'd probably be at least an hour.

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,161
Speaker 1: Pretty sure.

101
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,628
Speaker 1: the fastest trains on earth are those two Chinese bullet trains.

102
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,265
Speaker 0: So twice as fast as the best the Accela could do under ideal conditions Right.

103
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:15,500
Speaker 1: It looks like the Accela could go on those routes something like 220 230 kilometers an hour with relatively minor improvements to the tracks that they can't even do.

104
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:26,600
Speaker 1: Point is it's still a laughably, you know not as Until Biden didn't actually want to invest in trains at all in the last century.

105
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:33,419
Speaker 1: Anyway, yep operating speed 240 kilometers an hour is a baseline operating speed.

106
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,558
Speaker 1: Looks like they picked that number because that's the number that was reasonable to expect all the tracks to be upgraded to in.

107
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:44,734
Speaker 1: the u.s Couldn't even hit that But I encourage this.

108
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:51,160
Speaker 1: I hope the u.s Does something similar someday and I hope we do whatever we need to do to at least connect the Northeast Corridor via Amtrak.

109
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:54,238
Speaker 0: So yeah, I mean there should there definitely should just be.

110
00:08:54,258 --> 00:09:06,367
Speaker 0: you know The original point right is that if there are several options several options to achieve the same thing and one of them is just Measurably more damaging.

111
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:09,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should absolutely just make that decision.

112
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:15,708
Speaker 1: for people Like it's like having a bus or a train like those two options Make sense because they're comparable.

113
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:17,916
Speaker 1: like there's there are slightly different use cases.

114
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:18,980
Speaker 1: one could be the budget option.

115
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,180
Speaker 1: There's a lot of stuff going on But planes for that kind of route is just objectively more harmful and benefits almost no one.

116
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:29,720
Speaker 0: The same thing is like plastic bag at the grocery store, right that the paper bag is just better?

117
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,563
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

118
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,231
Speaker 0: Don't put the moral and take the pass on the consumer.

119
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:34,294
Speaker 1: That's the lesson.

120
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:38,671
Speaker 1: never put the moral hazard choice on the consumer Because that's not fair.

121
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:39,620
Speaker 1: We all live in a society.

122
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:42,419
Speaker 1: So you got any news.

123
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,200
Speaker 0: Do I have any news Katie coop?

124
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,366
Speaker 0: No, that's not a news.

125
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,214
Speaker 0: That's that's my thing of the day for next Wednesday.

126
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,199
Speaker 1: Oh for next Wednesday.

127
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,604
Speaker 1: Okay I got some more news that I.

128
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:54,309
Speaker 0: it's not even what's not even Wednesday.

129
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,497
Speaker 1: I just figured you wanted to talk about it.

130
00:09:56,577 --> 00:10:01,715
Speaker 1: I did And then you sent me another link that was like.

131
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:06,793
Speaker 0: and then I said I said I said I said I said, what did I say?

132
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:11,127
Speaker 0: Wait, I'll use that on a Wednesday Thing of today for today something else.

133
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:12,551
Speaker 1: I didn't notice that part.

134
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:14,577
Speaker 0: Wait, I'll use that on a Wednesday.

135
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:14,919
Speaker 0: Yeah.

136
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:15,843
Speaker 1: All right There we go.

137
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:16,829
Speaker 1: So I got some news.

138
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,795
Speaker 1: This is actually a big deal.

139
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:24,300
Speaker 1: So New York City, I'll summarize this because you can go read Wikipedia if you care about all the details.

140
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:47,166
Speaker 1: there basically are two gigantic tunnels that get all the water New York City needs into the city and they are so old and So necessary that I want to say since 1917 and 1936 for those two tunnels neither one has been inspected at any point Because there's no way to

141
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:47,748
Speaker 0: inspect it.

142
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:51,260
Speaker 0: You got to turn the water off exact because otherwise you go into the tunnel you drown.

143
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:54,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, so tunnel number one waters in there moving.

144
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:55,100
Speaker 0: how fast right?

145
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:55,902
Speaker 0: Death.

146
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:59,419
Speaker 1: if you go in there and you might think well turn one off leave the other one on turning one.

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,127
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's not water.

148
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,329
Speaker 1: turning one off would literally start killing New Yorkers Like there's not enough water.

149
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,315
Speaker 0: You can't just have one.

150
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,059
Speaker 0: how I get a shit.

151
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:16,923
Speaker 1: So tell us number one and two Thankfully just seem to still be trucking but we have no idea how hot like how they're doing So.

152
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:23,649
Speaker 1: the city has been trying for a little over 50 years To build tunnel number three.

153
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,826
Speaker 0: This is like even mind these these tunnels right are Just to give you a perspective right?

154
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:33,440
Speaker 0: So the water comes from upstate New York like many Harmon type places.

155
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:39,560
Speaker 0: There are many there are many reservoirs and we have the Catskill aqueduct is like the biggest longest.

156
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,549
Speaker 0: It's like the longest man-made tunnel is I don't know.

157
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:47,006
Speaker 0: It's this humongous aqueduct right that gets the water to the city right.

158
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:52,459
Speaker 0: that system Once it's in the city There's like this place that you know.

159
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,446
Speaker 0: I've seen it on.

160
00:11:53,768 --> 00:12:02,762
Speaker 0: I seen a picture one time of like Where the water comes from the aqueduct and enters the New York water system and that's where these other tunnels come into play the tunnel One and two.

161
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:05,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a tunnel one and two doesn't?

162
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:13,020
Speaker 0: outside isn't like, you know up in New York's, you know somewhere north Right, that's actually that's the Catskill aqueduct and other things that feed in or whatever.

163
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the system that gets water to New York is both very complicated but also surprisingly simple in terms of how it operates.

164
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:22,894
Speaker 0: It's just as if it's complicated and simple hard and easy.

165
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,060
Speaker 0: Yeah and expensive.

166
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:27,012
Speaker 1: That's how I would describe most major infrastructure like.

167
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,860
Speaker 1: the principles involved are fairly simple.

168
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:37,980
Speaker 1: Like a lot of these things are designed so that they're slightly downhill For like miles and miles and miles and miles and miles to the point that you don't need pumps water will just go.

169
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:53,360
Speaker 1: but To design that system to actually get the water from all the places and get it to the right place in the right quantities Figuring out that exact angle and figuring out exactly how to put it all together and how to deal with exceptions That is very complicated.

170
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:57,219
Speaker 0: Also the further away you get from the start of the tunnel the deeper you got to dig.

171
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:02,060
Speaker 1: Like well the tunnel number three, I think it's gonna be six hundred feet underground.

172
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:03,404
Speaker 0: That's far.

173
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:09,360
Speaker 1: that is very far especially because this area is a lot of like bedrock kind of ground.

174
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,243
Speaker 1: Just it's way.

175
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,952
Speaker 0: it's way lower than subways like not even close.

176
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,100
Speaker 0: It's it's way down there.

177
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:21,438
Speaker 1: So work has begun on the final phase of tunnel number three.

178
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:31,332
Speaker 1: tunnel Number three actually is as far as I've read it started supplying water to Manhattan But it is not linked to the rest of the New York City system yet.

179
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,080
Speaker 1: And the final segment is in Long Island City.

180
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,318
Speaker 1: That's the last part they have to dig.

181
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:42,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what's interesting about these these tunnels right is that you know, yeah, you have to be able to access them somehow.

182
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,147
Speaker 0: So there's these shafts, right?

183
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:48,597
Speaker 0: It's like a various spots along the tunnel, right?

184
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:52,127
Speaker 1: There's a vertical Jeopardy question or jeopardy answer.

185
00:13:52,388 --> 00:14:01,116
Speaker 1: What are places river really would like to break into if he wouldn't be around Along that's along the tunnel right at various spots.

186
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:11,895
Speaker 0: every so often There is some vertical hole like a straight down hole that there where you could go from the surface of the earth Open it up and go downstairs elevator.

187
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,276
Speaker 0: I don't know what.

188
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:15,758
Speaker 0: they got in there And go down to where the tunnel is.

189
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,292
Speaker 0: Obviously, they're all fucking locked.

190
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,827
Speaker 1: because yeah In fact, the city has actually started.

191
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:22,068
Speaker 1: they've.

192
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,422
Speaker 1: there were a lot more photos and press access to the sites where they were building tunnel Number three.

193
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:31,940
Speaker 1: they have actually started scrubbing all those images off the internet wherever they find them and they have control over them.

194
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,709
Speaker 1: They've banned press access.

195
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,197
Speaker 1: They've shut down archives.

196
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:48,408
Speaker 1: They're basically There's a lot of secrecy now around the exact details of where tunnel number three is Well, I mean for security reasons and also for you know picky me out, of course Yeah, people who are going there and die.

197
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:51,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a super dangerous place to work.

198
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,540
Speaker 0: You know the people working there's are you know, risking their lives just to dig the thing, right?

199
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,750
Speaker 0: So they don't want anyone unnecessarily you would.

200
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,400
Speaker 0: you would never be fat if you went in there and died.

201
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,205
Speaker 0: You would never be found.

202
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 1: I bet it's probably mafia bodies in the tunnel But like these stores always fascinating because any any piece of information you learn even reading this article I'm gonna link to You'll notice something.

203
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:16,280
Speaker 1: and if you wonder about that you could go down a rabbit hole that would consume the rest of your night.

204
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:27,602
Speaker 1: Like for example tunnel number three first began delivering water to Manhattan in 1998. and Why those?

205
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,964
Speaker 1: why the end is there?

206
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:35,310
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but that links to another article that There's a whole bunch of nonsense going on.

207
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:46,919
Speaker 0: The point is is that once tunnel three is done and fully operational then they're going to shut down Temporarily tunnel number one, which will be by humans in over a hundred years.

208
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:59,159
Speaker 0: There will be enough capacity to turn the water off on the other tunnels at least enough to go in there Yeah, and hopefully not die when going in there and clean it fix it, etc.

209
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,912
Speaker 0: Which will probably take many many years.

210
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:10,400
Speaker 1: and then now there is a danger Because apparently we New York City partly due to climate change has started to hit already.

211
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,060
Speaker 1: It's bumping up against the maximum throughput of tunnels one and two combined.

212
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:22,596
Speaker 1: So we got to do the maintenance on one and two before we get to the point where we now can't turn off any of them Again, which is probably coming.

213
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:28,860
Speaker 1: The last interesting thing is so work began on the last two shafts there.

214
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,800
Speaker 1: It's like a 14 mile one and I think an 11 mile one.

215
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:46,040
Speaker 1: The final end of this looks like it's going to be in Mm-hmm, and then they have to build even more tunnels to connect it to even more parts of the city that are not as important.

216
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:49,860
Speaker 1: I think in 2026 is when they can plan shutting down to the number one temporarily.

217
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:57,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know SimCity 2000 when they added the water system really under you know You could just drag pipes and just like diggity diggity instantly.

218
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:02,259
Speaker 0: It's like they while the game is paused They really did not accurately simulate.

219
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:07,180
Speaker 1: This feels more like you haven't played hearts of iron with us yet when we did some live games.

220
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:08,428
Speaker 1: It's like all right.

221
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,519
Speaker 1: I want to make a new ship.

222
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:14,257
Speaker 1: I want to another destroyer in my fleet and you click a bunch of buttons and then it'll.

223
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:23,556
Speaker 1: you'll look at the game and the Game says like yeah, it's October 4th 1937 that's next destroyer will be done in 1941 and that's as fast as it's gonna be there.

224
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:31,970
Speaker 1: and Four hours later, you'll get a notification like hey that one ship you asked for is done in some other news.

225
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:47,839
Speaker 1: This is interesting because we talked about this on geek nights and you but I think we even linked to the documentary of course but as you know the the character Apu on The Simpsons is problematic for a bunch of reasons and There's been a lot of conversation around that.

226
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,984
Speaker 1: We're not qualified to talk.

227
00:17:49,024 --> 00:18:02,708
Speaker 1: wasn't there a whole documentary Fantastic documentary and one of the points in it was that Hank Azaria in the documentary like Basically seemed to disagree didn't want to engage was defensive and the documentary kind of focused on that.

228
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,482
Speaker 1: rightly The news which just happened.

229
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,587
Speaker 1: this looks like it's breaking.

230
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:24,670
Speaker 1: as of like 7 a.m Today or at least very recently in the last few days Hank Azaria actually turned around and issued not a press release saying like I apologize But he was doing some interview thing and he talked about this topic and how the documentary actually forced him to see things.

231
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,553
Speaker 1: He changed his like.

232
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:26,536
Speaker 1: he realized he's wrong.

233
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:27,619
Speaker 1: He up.

234
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:33,076
Speaker 1: He like openly and it appears very earnestly apologized and I'm not gonna like.

235
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,690
Speaker 1: this does not excuse anything that happened in the past.

236
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,490
Speaker 1: That is not even a not something we could even like discuss because we're two white dudes doing a podcast.

237
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:41,233
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not.

238
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:45,470
Speaker 0: how can we I can't you know, accept someone's apology because I'm not the harmed person?

239
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:57,941
Speaker 1: Yeah, right but I think this article is worth reading because it is also from the perspective of an Indian American talking about Like this apology and it links to the apology and it's.

240
00:18:58,623 --> 00:19:00,490
Speaker 1: it's something I honestly didn't expect to happen.

241
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:13,228
Speaker 1: I expected that that documentary like we all watched it and that Hank Azaria We're just never saying anything about this again and everyone just try to avoid being in any way tied to that controversy and instead kind of out of nowhere.

242
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:18,510
Speaker 1: he like Apologized and there was at least a step forward in that conversation.

243
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:22,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anyone doesn't know he's like he's the voice actor.

244
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,568
Speaker 0: He voices like half the characters on the show.

245
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:26,623
Speaker 0: Yep He's also a real actor.

246
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:27,389
Speaker 0: He's been a lot of movies.

247
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:32,297
Speaker 1: But yeah, I know what you mean.

248
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,857
Speaker 0: voice actors are real actors, right but you know, they're like you people.

249
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:41,356
Speaker 0: I think people don't realize like you'll be watching a movie like I Think he was in Heat, right?

250
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:41,718
Speaker 0: He's never.

251
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,850
Speaker 0: I've never think he's ever been like the main character.

252
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:53,935
Speaker 0: He might have been in certain things I don't know about but it's like you'll see him in like he'll be in a movie and you won't realize it's like that's fucking Chief Wiggum Because he's not using that voice.

253
00:19:53,956 --> 00:20:00,209
Speaker 0: He's using whatever voice is appropriate for the movies and you know, which is not you know, it's not like.

254
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,866
Speaker 0: You know the the bender Jake guy who sounds the same.

255
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:04,409
Speaker 0: What's his name?

256
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,709
Speaker 1: Why do I always forget that dude's name?

257
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:09,941
Speaker 0: If you told me the name, I'd be like.

258
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:14,584
Speaker 0: if you said the name first I'd be like, oh that I know that is I literally forget this dude's the Joe DiMaggio.

259
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:23,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly Literally every time I just forget that dude's name, but anyway, it's not like.

260
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:29,940
Speaker 0: you know Joe when he's voicing a character like you can tell it's him, right but His area like you can't.

261
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,128
Speaker 0: he does different voice every time.

262
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:38,390
Speaker 1: yep It's interesting how over time that voice became in my brain the voice of Jake and like if I ever watched a few drama.

263
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,918
Speaker 1: It's just like oh that's Jake's voice and it feels weird.

264
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,707
Speaker 1: instead of looking at Jake and saying oh that's bender's voice.

265
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:44,349
Speaker 1: That feels weird.

266
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:47,515
Speaker 1: But yeah, just I was.

267
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:51,410
Speaker 1: I was surprised that there was a further note in this story.

268
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,910
Speaker 1: Like I didn't think anything would ever come of this story again, at least from the white dude.

269
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,905
Speaker 1: So yeah read this and form your own opinion.

270
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:02,489
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna Really comment on that further.

271
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:04,887
Speaker 1: So do you have any news?

272
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:08,376
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

273
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,667
Speaker 0: there's nothing really happening.

274
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,434
Speaker 1: I Mean, there's a lot happening.

275
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:16,930
Speaker 1: It's just stuff that we're not qualified to comment on or really don't want to center our voices on here.

276
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,535
Speaker 1: I'll go to FARC.

277
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,006
Speaker 1: It's going on a FARC right now.

278
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:19,470
Speaker 1: Let's see.

279
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,456
Speaker 1: Uh Something about the yellow pages.

280
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,101
Speaker 1: all these headlines are all hard.

281
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:25,944
Speaker 0: No, no.

282
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,509
Speaker 0: No, I'm at Google News.

283
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,147
Speaker 0: No No, those are our Monday newses.

284
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:31,643
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

285
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:39,070
Speaker 1: Tech company razor announces plastic free single-use toilet bamboo toilet paper, which raises more questions than it answers.

286
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:42,782
Speaker 1: Yes An RV exploded somewhere.

287
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:55,439
Speaker 1: All right, that's sad Uh, I got a bunch of phone calls today from an alarm company telling me that a temperature sensor was continuing to get hotter and Hotter at some middle school in New Jersey.

288
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:57,430
Speaker 1: They have not called back recently.

289
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:13,128
Speaker 1: So I'm assuming that that school did not burn down and that they've realized they were calling the wrong number all day things Of the day, so check this out.

290
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:22,367
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to a Twitter thread from a fantastic Twitter account in Kuna Bula which mostly talks about Historic writing historic texts.

291
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,700
Speaker 1: can a form tablets that kind of thing like Dead Sea Scrolls stuff like really good history.

292
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,483
Speaker 0: Yeah form isn't it?

293
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:28,969
Speaker 0: CUNY form can.

294
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,479
Speaker 1: a form is how I've heard most professors pronounce it.

295
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:32,946
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know the end.

296
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,771
Speaker 0: I don't know the answer.

297
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,575
Speaker 0: I'm just asking.

298
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:37,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm good but most professors pronounce it.

299
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:55,471
Speaker 1: that way in my experience could also be wrong because as you all may remember if you listen to gig nights a Long time in my middle school and in my high school multiple teachers pronounce the name Goethe as goeth and I was too stupid to realize they were wrong.

300
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:59,896
Speaker 0: I Didn't know you were so adamant about saying Heracles.

301
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:01,765
Speaker 0: all the time I am adamant because I.

302
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:02,990
Speaker 1: that's something I care about.

303
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,914
Speaker 1: I'm weirdly mad about.

304
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,460
Speaker 1: I still don't know why I'm so mad about that.

305
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:20,612
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'll link to the Twitter thread because the thing that is the thing that day is amazing But this Twitter thread does a really good job of Framing a particular aspect of why this thing is so amazing.

306
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:21,876
Speaker 1: if you've never heard of it.

307
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,540
Speaker 1: This is the trippytaka coriana.

308
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:29,755
Speaker 1: If I describe this without explaining like without just telling you what it is.

309
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:42,799
Speaker 1: It's basically possibly the most complete and error-free transmission and storage of about two gigabytes of data from in the course of human history.

310
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:55,160
Speaker 1: this is two gigabytes of data that has been maintained error-free since long before the year 1200 and The story behind how it was made and what it is is just amazing.

311
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,208
Speaker 1: Basically it is.

312
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:09,659
Speaker 1: if I had to summarize it is a collection of the Buddhist scriptures carved into 481258 wooden printing blocks.

313
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:21,434
Speaker 1: Those printing blocks are stored in a special building that was built in the 13th century with the idea it was designed to be a permanent archive of this information.

314
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:26,271
Speaker 1: it tended to last forever and It does continue to exist.

315
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:35,760
Speaker 1: It's the same building It's the same wood blocks and the cool thing about it is the design was such that the wooden blocks are the authoritative source of truth.

316
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:47,260
Speaker 1: They spent like 13 years carving these blocks with the characters not only so that they could then say this is the official Unedited version of this text where there couldn't be a disagreement about it or a way to forge one.

317
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:51,919
Speaker 1: It's it's intricately catalogued and stored in a way to where it's persisted to this day.

318
00:24:52,702 --> 00:25:03,358
Speaker 1: But what they would do is take those blocks out and use those blocks to print Books and the books were what people had access to the monks who ran or run this site.

319
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,130
Speaker 1: to this day They just maintained the blocks themselves.

320
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,745
Speaker 0: Mmm, I can't believe.

321
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:18,561
Speaker 0: this thing is basically like a wonder of the world that like no one I've never heard of it It wasn't designated as a UNESCO heritage site until like 1995.

322
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,912
Speaker 0: UNESCO is an interesting thing.

323
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:20,859
Speaker 0: I always think about UNESCO.

324
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:24,219
Speaker 0: It's like it feels like every country in the world except the United States.

325
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:24,963
Speaker 0: Maybe like.

326
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,333
Speaker 0: do we not like, you know, like sighs.

327
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,020
Speaker 0: do we like not sign up with them or something?

328
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:35,600
Speaker 0: And every other country in the world UNESCO like dictates like this is a cultural heritage site.

329
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,965
Speaker 0: This is an important thing.

330
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,449
Speaker 1: I mean we do that too, but we're like.

331
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,031
Speaker 0: are there any?

332
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,640
Speaker 0: are there any UNESCO cultural heritage sites in New?

333
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:42,060
Speaker 0: York City?

334
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:50,100
Speaker 1: What was that Eddie is a bit long ago where it was like oh this mall was built in.

335
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:57,420
Speaker 0: Yeah in the United States like, you know, we we dictate our own things.

336
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,300
Speaker 0: We're like, ah, this is a national monument, right?

337
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,525
Speaker 0: We don't know.

338
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:10,740
Speaker 0: when there's no international people like saying ah This is an important thing even even things in the United States in our territory that are older than our very I don't know.

339
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:11,182
Speaker 1: I do.

340
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:14,497
Speaker 1: I probably do not know how many UNESCO World Heritage sites there are in the u.s.

341
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,060
Speaker 0: I don't know that.

342
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,321
Speaker 0: I don't.

343
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:24,617
Speaker 0: yeah, I just know that like that's I just know that UNESCO is an organization and and you know picking You know designating cultural heritage sites is one of their functions.

344
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:25,240
Speaker 0: That's what I know.

345
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:26,565
Speaker 1: But think about this.

346
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,091
Speaker 1: most of you probably never heard of this.

347
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:32,285
Speaker 1: so yeah in the year like 1000 they made this thing.

348
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:34,652
Speaker 1: in the year like 1200 something.

349
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:42,075
Speaker 1: it got burned down by the Mongols and then the nation State of the place at the time decided you know what we're gonna rebuild this thing.

350
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,079
Speaker 1: We're gonna make it even better.

351
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:48,951
Speaker 1: and that data is That data has made it further than a lot of data.

352
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:51,700
Speaker 1: I have generated in the last 10 years, right?

353
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,623
Speaker 0: So it's in Korea.

354
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:58,541
Speaker 0: so think about all the shit that has happened in Korea including obviously Korean War yeah between 1200 something.

355
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:06,939
Speaker 0: and today Yep, and nobody went there and messed it up even though a lot of people wanted to take it.

356
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,566
Speaker 1: That really sets this up.

357
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:18,372
Speaker 1: the production of the Tripitaka Coriana was an enormous national commitment of money and manpower Perhaps comparable to the u.s.

358
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:29,139
Speaker 1: Mission to the moon in the 60s Mm-hmm and this Twitter thread really frames it like the Transmission of data over the centuries like libraries do this.

359
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:41,480
Speaker 1: But this Twitter thread makes a good point about how that is usually serendipitous like the intention of a library Especially like in the United States is not necessarily to preserve an unedited have access.

360
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's to spread access.

361
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:47,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this was this was the kind of thing that you see in sci-fi.

362
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:55,460
Speaker 1: This was an archive that is intended to stand the test of time and last forever And it's doing a pretty fucking good job of lasting forever.

363
00:27:56,946 --> 00:28:01,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right well That's it's a really high quality thing of the day not as good as my thing of the day.

364
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,820
Speaker 1: So the day is real good, so is it okay?

365
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:26,976
Speaker 0: So there are these things in the United States, and I imagine no other country though I guess I could be wrong about that, but this feels like a very United States white people thing and that is Pig calling Contests which is you know you go to the country fair, and there's a microphone and you go to the microphone And you call a pig like here piggy piggy piggy.

366
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,983
Speaker 0: you know come on You know what it's you.

367
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:33,919
Speaker 0: what would you what noises would you make using you just your body and a mic and you know in?

368
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,135
Speaker 0: order to Convince a pig to come to you and move in your general direction right.

369
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:46,260
Speaker 0: and then I assume There's some sort of judging scoring system that I know nothing about and a winner is chosen.

370
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,267
Speaker 0: Maybe they get a ribbon.

371
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,254
Speaker 0: Maybe you get a prize.

372
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,120
Speaker 0: Maybe some bacon.

373
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,076
Speaker 0: I don't know what your prize is for winning the pig calling contest money.

374
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:56,273
Speaker 0: I don't know But obviously they're really hilarious to watch.

375
00:28:56,353 --> 00:29:02,240
Speaker 0: you know people making pig noises People jumping up and down people taking it seriously people taking it not so seriously.

376
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,363
Speaker 0: Etc.

377
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,612
Speaker 1: I participated.

378
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:11,560
Speaker 1: I learned how to do Pig calling as part of a 4-h thing with my Cub Scout pack when I was a little kid.

379
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:13,330
Speaker 0: We did not do that.

380
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,760
Speaker 1: Okay, but I got good.

381
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:26,254
Speaker 0: In this video somebody has taken Video footage from some pig calling contests and edit it together.

382
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:48,515
Speaker 0: on the right side of the screen and on the left side of the screen is a person with an electric guitar and Effectively They are playing the electric guitar With quite a bit of distortion along with the edited pig calling noises to create a somewhat good heavy metal song.

383
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:55,439
Speaker 0: because What's how far away is pig calling from heavy metal vocalists?

384
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:07,599
Speaker 1: Little more so reeling and a little less growling but otherwise No, I'm just saying Excellent excellent mashup here.

385
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:15,860
Speaker 1: In the meta moment my reading of the tale of Genji did not accelerate as expected because I thought I could sit outside and read.

386
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:16,611
Speaker 1: It got cold again.

387
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:20,793
Speaker 1: So I think it'll accelerate soon.

388
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:21,680
Speaker 1: give us another week or two.

389
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,058
Speaker 1: It's weirdly extra cold for some reason now, and hopefully it will be warm again soon.

390
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:30,735
Speaker 0: Gig night they gave us the super cold winter with all the snow and I was inside.

391
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:33,004
Speaker 0: it had to go outside and now it's Like ah, okay.

392
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,951
Speaker 0: We're almost ready to go outside still cold.

393
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it was so warm.

394
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,500
Speaker 1: I went for a bike ride.

395
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,103
Speaker 1: I'm home.

396
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:42,280
Speaker 0: Like I said the upside of the climate change is that it's global warming.

397
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:48,518
Speaker 0: It's like if you're gonna kill us all and raise the sea level at least in the meantime.

398
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,668
Speaker 0: if that's somehow Unavoidable because obviously I would like to avoid that.

399
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:56,004
Speaker 0: but if it's unavoidable at least make it 90 degrees every day While I'm done.

400
00:30:56,184 --> 00:31:00,180
Speaker 1: Well, you're talking about how New York City is a humid subtropical climate and has been for about five.

401
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,479
Speaker 0: Then why is it fucking 40 degrees?

402
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,597
Speaker 0: Because it's spring at the end of April.

403
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:11,600
Speaker 1: At least in the old days we wouldn't have that like couple weeks of it being weirdly warm before we had the cold snap again.

404
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,038
Speaker 1: It would just be cold and still be cold right now.

405
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:20,100
Speaker 1: There weren't many years where I was outside running and it was like 75 degrees and sunny on April 22nd in the fast.

406
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:21,777
Speaker 0: Just make it warm.

407
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:23,466
Speaker 1: Well, let's get in there.

408
00:31:23,587 --> 00:31:24,070
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

409
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:25,580
Speaker 1: I think it'll be warm this weekend.

410
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,229
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll go bike up on that South County Trailway.

411
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:29,333
Speaker 0: It's gonna rain.

412
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,440
Speaker 1: I only on Sunday last I checked.

413
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:33,326
Speaker 1: I'm gonna check right now.

414
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,500
Speaker 1: Let's see 10-day forecast for Queens.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not gonna be up biking.

424
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,506
Speaker 1: then I'll be biking at like 10.

425
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,200
Speaker 0: You can't get very far if you're not up at 8 in the morning.

426
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,618
Speaker 1: I got a lot more daylight now than I used to have at the end of the season last year.

427
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,084
Speaker 0: sunset 746 yeah, that's fine.

428
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:08,767
Speaker 1: I can bike in the dark.

429
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:09,248
Speaker 1: I got lights.

430
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,456
Speaker 0: sunrise 6 a.m Good.

431
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:11,858
Speaker 0: There you go.

432
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:12,380
Speaker 0: You got a skit.

433
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:18,100
Speaker 1: I only get up that early if I'm like hiking mountain climbing or skiing or something.

434
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:19,859
Speaker 1: I'm not getting up that early for a bike ride.

435
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:31,281
Speaker 0: It's a good strategy actually to get up that early for the bike ride because by the time you have escaped the car area The you know that there's no traffic at 6 a.m Really true Zone

436
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:40,360
Speaker 1: because usually I go to the west side because I like that route and I go up to Cortland up to Cortland Park to Get to the trail way, but it is much faster and more direct to just go over Randall's Island into the Bronx.

437
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:41,739
Speaker 0: That's the way I go.

438
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,959
Speaker 1: But those routes have a lot of cars and a lot of people parked in the bike lanes.

439
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,242
Speaker 0: They're not really.

440
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,129
Speaker 1: I've run into a lot of.

441
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,779
Speaker 1: in fact, I have a video of all the cars blocking the bike lanes.

442
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:53,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a bad.

443
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,199
Speaker 1: I get a time-lapse almost every time I do that ride.

444
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,191
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, uh, that's the meta moment.

445
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,475
Speaker 1: like can find our stuff.

446
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:04,451
Speaker 1: We're uh We're not doing any cons anytime soon.

447
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:06,160
Speaker 1: Like there won't be any guns anytime soon.

448
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,248
Speaker 1: Don't go to cons that happen anytime soon.

449
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,980
Speaker 0: Obviously, if you live in New Zealand, you can go to a car.

450
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,389
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if you live in New Zealand, you can go to a car packs off maybe some other Other countries, but that's toward the end of the year.

451
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:18,573
Speaker 0: I don't know.

452
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:20,479
Speaker 0: I can't say if you should go to that or not.

453
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like it's scheduled at least and they're still talking about increasing the capacity.

454
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:26,869
Speaker 1: Australia is doing better than us.

455
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:27,410
Speaker 1: we can say that.

456
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:30,974
Speaker 0: Okay It's hard not to be.

457
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:33,407
Speaker 1: yeah All right, so we'll get right into it.

458
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,899
Speaker 1: Oh, we didn't have a lot of Thursday shows queued up.

459
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:41,000
Speaker 1: Uh, so we're gonna talk about pets which is something yet is very near and dear to me.

460
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:50,854
Speaker 0: I've had a lot more pets than Scott at least but yes somehow in 15 16 years of geek nights We haven't done a topic so basic as pets something that comes up just every day.

461
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:52,620
Speaker 1: just review the Simpsons.

462
00:33:54,081 --> 00:34:04,015
Speaker 0: Sure, you know just saying I mean we did talk about Simpsons in the past at some point just not as the main bit Directly as itself, you know, it was incorporated into some other shows.

463
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:04,958
Speaker 0: right that happens a lot.

464
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,034
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, it's like said something so basic and fundamental to everyday life.

465
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,199
Speaker 0: We have not done a show on it.

466
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,900
Speaker 0: It's really hard to think of those things as they're hiding in plain sight.

467
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,752
Speaker 0: It's like what should I do a show on?

468
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:21,588
Speaker 0: and you could almost imagine a Simpson scene where someone's like hmm.

469
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,871
Speaker 0: What should I?

470
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,719
Speaker 0: something something and there's a giant something something walking around?

471
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:27,998
Speaker 1: Well, you know why?

472
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:35,760
Speaker 1: Well, I'm through the the process now like we used to have different processes We used to plan a lot more for a Thursday episode is well both bit during kovid.

473
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,016
Speaker 1: we'll both be in our respective computer rooms and we'll have a discord conversation of what should we do the show on.

474
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:51,060
Speaker 1: and Usually this now involves both of us looking around the room and typing nouns That we see that we don't think we've ever talked about that class of noun before.

475
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,527
Speaker 1: Usually I'm not out of the room.

476
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,054
Speaker 0: It's not likely to be a show.

477
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:58,197
Speaker 1: Yep, but Usually only to find out that.

478
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:06,202
Speaker 1: oh, yeah We actually did a show on that in 2006 and then we did it again in 2012 and here we are in 2021.

479
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:09,700
Speaker 0: But yeah, somehow we've never done a single pet show ever.

480
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:25,299
Speaker 1: So at least so easy if you think of other ideas along these lines something that is so simple and it's not Especially things that are not science technology gaming Anime animation comics manga something that is not one of those things.

481
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, tell us cuz we need a Thursday ideas.

482
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:42,280
Speaker 1: Yep So what's interesting is in my life partly like my family my entire family pretty much is very Like animal centric like we just always were even my extended family for the most part like not just like my direct family.

483
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:53,359
Speaker 1: So I basically lived surrounded by pets ranging from standard cats and dogs to exotics to Straight up like deer and raccoons at times.

484
00:35:53,962 --> 00:36:12,594
Speaker 1: so I've interacted with a lot of animals and it was actually a a weird not a homesickness cuz I was jazzed to be in college, but There was a very weird time in my life when I was at between RIT and the living in Beacon where I didn't have a pet and That like gap was very like prominent in my just feelings.

485
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:24,698
Speaker 1: and when we moved to New York City I have a pet again and I think that there that one period where I didn't have pets will hopefully be one of the only periods in my life That is of any significant length of time where there are not pets in my home.

486
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:26,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not the.

487
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:31,862
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not the exact opposite like never had a pet but I've not had Many pet right?

488
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:32,263
Speaker 0: It's like.

489
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,612
Speaker 0: what did I you know when I was very very young like?

490
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,440
Speaker 0: I can't even remember so young, right?

491
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:46,642
Speaker 0: My parents had a cat that was named Sherlock, right and my memory of this cat is not the cat itself I don't.

492
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:49,940
Speaker 0: I couldn't even pick it out of a row of cats in a lineup, right?

493
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,820
Speaker 0: Though I guess it was orange maybe but I think there's a photo of it somewhere.

494
00:36:55,262 --> 00:37:14,291
Speaker 0: But when I was young I remember the furniture my parents had in their bedroom Had all these like lines on it like all around the base of the furniture all the furniture Right and it wasn't until later that I realized Right that basically that cat was an evil demon cat.

495
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:17,240
Speaker 0: My parents were afraid was gonna kill me when I was in baby form.

496
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:27,390
Speaker 0: That scratched the shit up basically everything and you could tell how high the cat could reach because all the furniture was scratched Like this horizontal.

497
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,487
Speaker 0: it looked like, you know Like you go to the beach and you see the line where low tide is high tide reaches It's low cats.

498
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:36,901
Speaker 1: what it was like, it's low Exactly.

499
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:44,024
Speaker 0: So I think that you know, my parents they had you know a dog or you know different pets in their lives, but We didn't get.

500
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:50,100
Speaker 0: the only pet I had when I was a kid was I had some fish and then I didn't have fish.

501
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:59,106
Speaker 0: and then when I left to go to college they got dusty the dog and Then that's pretty much it in the Reuben family his pets go.

502
00:37:59,166 --> 00:37:59,990
Speaker 1: That's it was a good dog.

503
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:06,539
Speaker 1: I enjoyed my times hanging out with dusty though as I as he got older and dusty would definitely bark at me a lot more than he used to.

504
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,884
Speaker 0: Well dusty, uh, you know, I couldn't get him to bite you.

505
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:19,239
Speaker 0: but you know, yeah I did my best he'd bonk his head against me and then run away or go chase a Paper towel, I mean when you know, we haven't dusty.

506
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:22,510
Speaker 0: Yeah when dusty was a was like a baby dog.

507
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:26,830
Speaker 0: He would like eat paper towel, you know, yip a hole way too much.

508
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:30,790
Speaker 0: But then when he got older he sat on the couch and watch TV like a Reuben.

509
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, we What that?

510
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:39,166
Speaker 1: the only like common pet we never had like the really common pet was probably cats.

511
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:40,470
Speaker 1: not because no one like cats.

512
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,235
Speaker 1: We just ended up.

513
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:48,930
Speaker 1: our family never had cats Not even because anyone was allergic to them or anything and I at least when I was a kid was not allergic to cats.

514
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:58,628
Speaker 1: I am now as an adult like Frighteningly allergic to cats like to a degree that is like comical in an 80s movie.

515
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:02,049
Speaker 1: the character Who's only beat is they are allergic to cats allergic?

516
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,973
Speaker 1: But yeah, let's see we had So new.

517
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:19,500
Speaker 1: so when I was born my parents already had a bunch of dogs like just three bunch of dogs in the house And I have a lot of very like kid memory of those dogs like mascot and Libby Springer spandrels, and then we rescued dogs.

518
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,945
Speaker 1: We got Brock it.

519
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,550
Speaker 1: then we adopted different dogs.

520
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,369
Speaker 1: We just had dogs in the house for my entire life.

521
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:34,786
Speaker 1: We had fish The first pets that we like me and my little brother would like to have to take care of and there were our pets instead Of just the family pets hamsters.

522
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:35,250
Speaker 1: we had figgy.

523
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,395
Speaker 1: Hamsters don't live that long.

524
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:40,285
Speaker 1: Then we had figgy the second and we had figgy the third.

525
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:41,510
Speaker 1: then we had a fourth one.

526
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:42,606
Speaker 1: We just called figgy again.

527
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:47,614
Speaker 1: There was I want to say we had a fifth figgy and We just as kids.

528
00:39:47,996 --> 00:39:54,010
Speaker 1: figgy was such a good name for a hamster that we apparently Ademantly refused to ever name a hamster anything but figgy.

529
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,178
Speaker 0: That was just a hamsters at once.

530
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:59,490
Speaker 1: just two figgies now only ever had one hamster at a time.

531
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,003
Speaker 1: You know hamsters do not like to be around other hamsters for the most part.

532
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:04,650
Speaker 0: How do they make more hamsters?

533
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,169
Speaker 1: They're around them long enough to make more hamsters.

534
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,890
Speaker 1: Okay, interesting We had gerbils at one point that we got from a nun.

535
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,584
Speaker 0: I still know the difference between a gerbil and a hamster.

536
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:16,730
Speaker 0: Isn't it the same fucking thing there?

537
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,438
Speaker 1: They're completely different animals.

538
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,110
Speaker 1: They're not even remotely close to each other.

539
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:28,094
Speaker 1: okay, a hamster imagine like a tiny little bear a Gerbil imagine like our.

540
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:33,130
Speaker 1: take a rat and a squirrel mash them together and make them bitey.

541
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:40,448
Speaker 1: They're cute Not super like human focused smart compared to a lot of other small animals like that.

542
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:46,659
Speaker 1: Honestly, I don't think gerbils make good pets for like most people I think they should be treated more like an exotic pet.

543
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,988
Speaker 1: hamsters are much easier for people to deal with.

544
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:56,810
Speaker 1: I think Gerbils require special cages or you can literally drive them insane for reasons I don't really want to get into but we got these gerbils found.

545
00:40:56,911 --> 00:41:03,536
Speaker 0: I always found those interesting the hamster and the gerbil because I've never seen them out in the wild ever.

546
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:06,304
Speaker 1: Oh, I've seen wild.

547
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:08,270
Speaker 1: I've never seen a wild gerbil in person.

548
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,418
Speaker 1: I've seen wild hamsters in a zoo before.

549
00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:13,610
Speaker 1: I've never encountered an actual wild hamster on my own in the wild.

550
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I don't know like I'm talking like out in the wild.

551
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:18,910
Speaker 0: It's like where did these animals come from?

552
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,195
Speaker 0: I'm sure I can all different place.

553
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,810
Speaker 0: Like I've only ever seen them as pets in a cage in someone's house, you know?

554
00:41:24,212 --> 00:41:27,247
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I know I've seen guinea pigs in the wild.

555
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:32,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah But I think The like not actually not.

556
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:37,349
Speaker 0: I haven't personally seen them in the wild but I've seen in the wild on you know video.

557
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:40,069
Speaker 1: at one Point we had we had a little mouse who was our pet.

558
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,343
Speaker 1: we rescued him from a tragic pet shop that the owner.

559
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:52,210
Speaker 1: and when we were kids because one thing my mom did one of her Jobs was basically rescuing animals from abusers and dangerous situations and like doing animal welfare stuff.

560
00:41:52,935 --> 00:42:01,910
Speaker 1: and there was this one moment where a Owner of a pet store basically just gave up and just left just like abandoned a pet store full of animals to die.

561
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:09,610
Speaker 1: So my mom was part of like that rescue effort and we adopted a little mouse From that among some other animals that we helped foster.

562
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,416
Speaker 1: I forget I'm actually trying to.

563
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:17,015
Speaker 1: I'm old enough to not be able to fully piece together chronologies from my youth But I think that's the same time.

564
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,099
Speaker 1: We got our second love bird.

565
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,290
Speaker 1: I think frisbee also came from that pet store if I recall correctly.

566
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:36,614
Speaker 1: But I think that class of like small animal that is Reasonably durable and doesn't require super specialized knowledge to take care of and only lives a couple of years is probably like.

567
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:50,164
Speaker 1: I think there's something good for Children to be able to experience that and also honestly to experience that loss and to learn about like the real world and death And everything along the way without also having the commitment of that.

568
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:51,670
Speaker 1: chinchilla is gonna live 20 more years.

569
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:55,092
Speaker 1: That's something I've noticed.

570
00:42:55,153 --> 00:43:10,578
Speaker 1: a lot of people Will like a lot of people who which chinchilla is I think specifically Don't actually know how long they live and assume that they live like a hamster or a gerbil or or a squirrel or something And then discover that they can live a lot longer and don't know what to do.

571
00:43:11,563 --> 00:43:13,274
Speaker 0: That seems to have a parent and out lives you.

572
00:43:13,294 --> 00:43:16,860
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Dusty we got dusty when I was very young.

573
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,986
Speaker 1: My mom still has dusty.

574
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:23,035
Speaker 1: dusty will probably outlive both my parents the way Parrots tend to go dusty the bird outlive.

575
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:23,700
Speaker 0: dusty the dog.

576
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, dusty the bird still remembers me to this day despite the fact that I don't see dusty very often.

577
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:31,764
Speaker 1: It's really funny and cute Mm-hmm.

578
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:32,686
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't they yeah?

579
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:36,475
Speaker 1: Well, it's not every animal would necessarily remember that kind of thing.

580
00:43:36,515 --> 00:43:38,600
Speaker 1: like different animals have different relationships with humans.

581
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:49,920
Speaker 1: but One thing that's it's interesting how in America There's certain pets that society just treats as standard and people have a lot of basic knowledge.

582
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:56,530
Speaker 1: like a lot of people get dogs and cats and hamsters and They don't know anything about those animals at all.

583
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,100
Speaker 1: like a parent's getting for their kid like oh kids should have a pen.

584
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:01,087
Speaker 1: I'll go to the Petco and get a pet.

585
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:08,460
Speaker 1: or in the old days before a lot of places started banning this go to like One of those dodgy pet stores like literally in a mall to get like a dog.

586
00:44:09,186 --> 00:44:10,478
Speaker 0: There was a pet store in the mall.

587
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,852
Speaker 0: there Lived for quite a while right, but it's like yeah, you know people.

588
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:15,660
Speaker 0: I think people just don't think too hard about it.

589
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,950
Speaker 0: They're like you know buy a dog all right.

590
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,618
Speaker 0: You know you got to buy dog food.

591
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:22,320
Speaker 0: obviously You know give it water, and you're in the pet store.

592
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:24,846
Speaker 0: What else you got to do?

593
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:26,353
Speaker 0: yeah, what else you got to do?

594
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:29,876
Speaker 0: take it to the vet one time You know and then you're good to go.

595
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:33,429
Speaker 1: yep And the problem is they just even those animals do require.

596
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,880
Speaker 1: a lot of people have problems especially with a lot of dogs and cats.

597
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:51,690
Speaker 1: Where the problem is they don't actually know shit about dogs and cats and they do the wrong thing Feed the wrong food train the wrong way and cause interesting social or physical Disorders in the animals that end up like.

598
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:56,018
Speaker 1: a lot of problematic behavior of pets usually comes from owners Not actually knowing about those animals.

599
00:44:56,982 --> 00:45:01,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of times people will you know and you'll hear people say like oh my you know like.

600
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:02,720
Speaker 0: they'll say little act like.

601
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,655
Speaker 0: It's just the nature of their animal.

602
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:09,567
Speaker 0: like you know Like yeah is your dog my dog isn't.

603
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,613
Speaker 0: my dog is not very social.

604
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,900
Speaker 0: It's like he doesn't go well with other dogs.

605
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,880
Speaker 1: Have you ever introduced him to another dog?

606
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,760
Speaker 0: How did your dog get that way?

607
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:21,586
Speaker 0: You know?

608
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:29,425
Speaker 1: yep, uh But at least with those animals so many people have them and so much like.

609
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:34,957
Speaker 1: really basic knowledge is in popular culture that a Lot of people do well enough.

610
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:44,609
Speaker 1: so those animals don't particularly suffer even if they're not necessarily raised particularly Well, like they might eat bad food and have like some minor health problems, but they tend to do also.

611
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:54,570
Speaker 0: There's that also there's enough infrastructure around those Grocery store, there's dog food in this cat food at the grocery store, right?

612
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:59,630
Speaker 0: You know if you go to a vet even in the middle of nowhere, they know what to do with a cat or a dog.

613
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:07,818
Speaker 0: You know, it's common right if you show up with your I don't know monkey to the vet and you know Just a standard vet in a suburb.

614
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,790
Speaker 0: They're gonna be like, I don't know what to do with monkey.

615
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:11,716
Speaker 1: Yeah The classification there you'll.

616
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:23,230
Speaker 1: you'll notice that normal vets will usually only be able to handle Dogs cats and a small number of other common animals and most other animals you might have as a pet are technically classified as exotics.

617
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:25,247
Speaker 1: Many vets will not treat them at all.

618
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:30,346
Speaker 1: Some vets will treat them but they'll warn you like yeah, I'm gonna do the best I can like.

619
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:38,150
Speaker 1: I'm not an expert here But like for even rabbits like we have to take the rabbit to a specialized vet that can handle exotics.

620
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,385
Speaker 0: And then there's the other kind of animal like, you know, gerbil hamster where it's like.

621
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:43,530
Speaker 0: do you really take it to the vet?

622
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,197
Speaker 0: It's sort of like I think you should.

623
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:49,847
Speaker 1: I think generally it's sort of an aside goldfish goldfish.

624
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:50,810
Speaker 0: Don't go to the vet, right?

625
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,488
Speaker 0: It's it's a gold.

626
00:46:53,110 --> 00:47:03,157
Speaker 1: Those goldfish goldfish can live a long time and have a very different Profile from what most people think is most people drastically Terribly mistreat goldfish, right?

627
00:47:03,177 --> 00:47:03,678
Speaker 0: So we got.

628
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,123
Speaker 0: so the fish I had right.

629
00:47:05,183 --> 00:47:07,170
Speaker 0: so I wasn't even like planning to get fish.

630
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,570
Speaker 0: But you know We were at like the perm festival Right and they had the old throw the ping-pong ball in and get a goldfish in a plastic bag.

631
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:14,613
Speaker 0: So I got.

632
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:20,610
Speaker 0: I got a goldfish in a plastic bag and then I put it in like a bowl of water, right?

633
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:22,957
Speaker 0: And then we went to the stood.

634
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:25,006
Speaker 0: there was a little aquarium store in the mall, right.

635
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:26,797
Speaker 0: and I was like, all right What do I need for the?

636
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,329
Speaker 0: you know, the goldfish see a little bowl?

637
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,270
Speaker 0: Right and they're like you got to put in distilled water.

638
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,921
Speaker 0: You can't be putting in your sink water.

639
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:34,069
Speaker 0: and I was like, oh, yeah.

640
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,738
Speaker 0: And then they were like, yeah, you also got to put this stuff in the water So the fish doesn't get.

641
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:40,904
Speaker 0: there's a disease called ik.

642
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,152
Speaker 0: Yeah Thanks.

643
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:44,336
Speaker 0: It's like.

644
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:46,081
Speaker 0: what disease could you come like that?

645
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:47,966
Speaker 0: What is the most disease name?

646
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:48,668
Speaker 0: Right?

647
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:50,982
Speaker 0: It's like We need a disease name.

648
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:51,729
Speaker 0: He's got the ik.

649
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:55,963
Speaker 0: It's a. basically the fish will get white spots and die.

650
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:57,310
Speaker 0: I don't know what causes it or anything.

651
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:57,872
Speaker 0: I'm not a vet.

652
00:47:57,932 --> 00:48:05,602
Speaker 0: All I know is that if you see a white spots a little parasite like a malaria kind of thing Okay, if you see white spots on your goldfish, it's not good.

653
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:07,974
Speaker 0: Right and then it's like here Here's some fish food.

654
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:08,697
Speaker 0: Shake it in the bowl.

655
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:11,250
Speaker 0: Once or once a day, you know, it's like, okay.

656
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,860
Speaker 0: So we got the bowl and we did all.

657
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:23,373
Speaker 0: I just followed the instructions, you know I did what they told me to and The fish lived and it got pretty big started as like the tiniest goldfish and then it was like a couple inches long Goldfish.

658
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:29,262
Speaker 0: and then one day my mom came home from wherever she was and the goldfish was not in the bowl It was on the kitchen counter.

659
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:30,230
Speaker 0: So I guess he had a little jump.

660
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:36,607
Speaker 0: So my mom picked it up and put it back in the bowl and it came back to life.

661
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:37,310
Speaker 0: it wasn't dead.

662
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:40,950
Speaker 0: So we're like, well, I guess it doesn't fit in the bowl.

663
00:48:41,473 --> 00:48:44,610
Speaker 0: So we would put like a cutting board so we couldn't jump out of the bowl.

664
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:47,969
Speaker 0: And then we got a fish tank.

665
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:55,136
Speaker 0: so then we had this big old fish tank and honestly, I was actually more interested in the Bubbly treasure chest than the fish.

666
00:48:55,156 --> 00:49:08,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I honestly I generally find that fish aren't the best like fish teach different Sets of lessons to kids and I find a lot of kids seem to just get bored with fish After a certain point or a certain age unless they get into the technical aspects.

667
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:16,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was mostly you know, like I had a friend who was like aquarium nerd, you know, like he was into aquariums But I was just like it looks cool.

668
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:19,066
Speaker 0: I like it, you know, bubbly treasure chest.

669
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:24,743
Speaker 0: Awesome, you know But I didn't actually you know, it's like the fish is just fish.

670
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:25,526
Speaker 0: It's cool.

671
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:31,370
Speaker 0: Watch it sometimes, you know I think like you're not like I'm making a relationship with the fish more interactive.

672
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:35,590
Speaker 1: Cuddling with the fish I think like in general like other kinds of pets are just very much.

673
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:44,747
Speaker 1: I think they can generally be a very positive influence on kids Like I know like the fact that we had pets my whole life Really shaped who I am as a person today.

674
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:49,470
Speaker 1: like that I think I might have ended up being a very different person had we not had so many pets and animals.

675
00:49:50,012 --> 00:49:58,179
Speaker 1: because if you actually I've noticed most people who have problems with their pets another thing that they don't do is not just that they Don't learn like they don't have the book knowledge, but fine.

676
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:58,801
Speaker 1: Sure.

677
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,510
Speaker 1: They also just don't actually pay attention to their pets.

678
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:07,610
Speaker 1: They don't actually like look at our pets behaving and think about like why is that dog doing that?

679
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,355
Speaker 1: What's going on in their little brain?

680
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:14,110
Speaker 1: like try to understand and empathize and like deal with that?

681
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,510
Speaker 1: A lot of people just don't and then they're surprised.

682
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:24,138
Speaker 0: Yeah the people are the people living their own lives and living the dog live their own life like it was a person and then only paying attention to the dog when it's like.

683
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:25,623
Speaker 0: I feel like having some dog time.

684
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:31,196
Speaker 0: the same way you would feel like I Feel like reading that book on the shelf and then when you're not reading it It's on the shelf and I think

685
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:41,570
Speaker 1: that attitude is less than it used to be but it was definitely exacerbated by the Proliferation of shitty like puppy mill pet stores in malls and places like that.

686
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,905
Speaker 1: I'm glad we're moving toward banning that kind of pet store.

687
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:46,230
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, we just to round out my fish story.

688
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:47,878
Speaker 0: So that fish was in that tank.

689
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:48,903
Speaker 0: right lucky the fish.

690
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:52,510
Speaker 0: and then we got a sec We're like, well, we got this big old fish tank now, right?

691
00:50:52,590 --> 00:51:01,221
Speaker 0: So we got a second goldfish a fancy-looking one and then we got a tiny little I don't know if it's technically a catfish But it looked like a catfish and it was really tiny and cuz.

692
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:06,485
Speaker 0: it was supposed to supposedly like, you know Eat a lot of the dirt towards the bottom of the tank, which it did.

693
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,273
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah bottom fitter That's your.

694
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:14,317
Speaker 1: you were getting towards starting to make like a mini ecosystem, which is how yeah I'm a real aquarium has to be managed.

695
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:21,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway the point that all that happened was the The fancy goldfish and the little catfish looking guy.

696
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:25,030
Speaker 0: They both died before the original fish died.

697
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:30,957
Speaker 0: The original fish last of the longest was eventually alone Right all by himself.

698
00:51:30,997 --> 00:51:36,781
Speaker 0: this this goldfish that you got for free at the at the carnival For like a ping-pong ball right.

699
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,890
Speaker 0: that shouldn't have lived more than like a week.

700
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:42,343
Speaker 0: I imagine none of the other fish at that little carnival probably survived.

701
00:51:42,363 --> 00:51:49,321
Speaker 0: a week lasted many years And then even though we kept doing every it preventative measure.

702
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:51,286
Speaker 0: They got the egg, right?

703
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:53,986
Speaker 0: So I Guess the egg is unavoidable.

704
00:51:54,067 --> 00:52:02,343
Speaker 1: Yep It's one thing that a lot of people who get pets especially when a family gets a pet for a kid Especially a longer-lived pet like not a hamster or something smaller.

705
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:05,535
Speaker 1: They tend to also like.

706
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:12,086
Speaker 1: there's a certain amount of Gross or grim animal husbandry knowledge that honestly people should know.

707
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:24,528
Speaker 1: like when I was a kid You could definitely tell the people who had read at least one book that talked about the serious real stuff about dogs versus the people who had never done that and relied on their vets for anything like those are the people like.

708
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:27,800
Speaker 1: the latter were the People who like didn't know they had to clip their dog's nails.

709
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:31,633
Speaker 1: like that kind of nonsense would happen, but also like Guy kind of.

710
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,301
Speaker 0: I don't know too many people like that everyone.

711
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:34,245
Speaker 0: I know is like fuck.

712
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,269
Speaker 0: I hate clipping the dog's name.

713
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh god.

714
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:37,581
Speaker 1: I hate dying you.

715
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,390
Speaker 1: you think living a dog's nails is a pain in the ass?

716
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,130
Speaker 1: It's got clipping a rabbit's nails.

717
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:45,243
Speaker 1: Most rabbits do not fucking want you to clip their nails and they can kick.

718
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:48,777
Speaker 1: you don't say they can kick way harder than you Would expect for a tiny little guy.

719
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:49,923
Speaker 0: you're huge.

720
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:53,930
Speaker 1: They're tiny just just holding down Yeah, but they're also fragile can't hold them down too hard.

721
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:54,391
Speaker 1: You got to be very.

722
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:56,338
Speaker 1: it's a delicate dance dog.

723
00:52:56,358 --> 00:52:59,890
Speaker 1: You can just like wrestle them down and cut the nail tranquilizer.

724
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:04,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what's that thing people always post on the internet about cats like bunny burrito.

725
00:53:04,363 --> 00:53:05,206
Speaker 0: That will mess you up.

726
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,370
Speaker 0: be smart use drugs.

727
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:15,180
Speaker 1: I Like the the the burrito method of you wrap the small animal in basically a blanket and then pull the little leggy out And that's how you do it.

728
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:20,230
Speaker 0: Well, there's also that thing like you grab a cat in a certain way, and then they just don't move get him by the scruff.

729
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:21,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, yep.

730
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:27,266
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically that kind of knowledge like it should be more normalized.

731
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:30,970
Speaker 1: learning that stuff Even though some of it is gross and terrifying.

732
00:53:31,632 --> 00:53:40,470
Speaker 1: It's kind of your responsibility if you're gonna have a pet to know at least like more about the pet Same as if like not to compare to a car which is a very different thing.

733
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:41,509
Speaker 1: The car doesn't have feelings.

734
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:52,276
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna have a car you should at least know the bare minimum about how that thing works or else it's gonna run down and break way earlier than you'd expect or you're gonna go to a Mechanic way too late.

735
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,590
Speaker 1: I know a lot of money and not understand what you're paying for.

736
00:53:55,213 --> 00:54:05,729
Speaker 1: There's a lot of tragic situations where people take a pet to the vet way too late And what would have been a $50 thing is now a $3,000 thing or a very sad conversation with the family.

737
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:17,430
Speaker 0: You know the fact that you said the word animal husbandry made me think of a nerdy thing which is in Civilization 6 the first three the first three technologies that you research in civilization 6.

738
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,635
Speaker 0: It's the first three available.

739
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:24,238
Speaker 0: And so the most basic ones are animal husbandry Mining and pottery.

740
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:29,819
Speaker 0: right and even someone even me It's like do I know pottery?

741
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,763
Speaker 0: not really?

742
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:31,686
Speaker 0: No, it's like.

743
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:32,670
Speaker 0: do I know mining?

744
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,096
Speaker 0: Not really.

745
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:35,689
Speaker 0: Do I know animal husbandry?

746
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,696
Speaker 0: Not really.

747
00:54:37,756 --> 00:54:38,058
Speaker 0: It's like.

748
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:39,327
Speaker 0: those are the three basic one.

749
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:46,410
Speaker 0: Yes I Don't think sib6 should be like the defining, you know, the sib6 text tree should define.

750
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:56,489
Speaker 0: You know how we should behave as a society, but the fact that most people Self-included don't know all that much about those three basic things.

751
00:54:57,432 --> 00:55:08,230
Speaker 1: I remember what I did my thing today a while ago about a tackle block like the practical use of police like That knowledge does not exist in a lot of people's heads because they don't have to do it on a day-to-day basis.

752
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:09,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

753
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:12,470
Speaker 0: it's like writing might be the earliest one actually.

754
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,910
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, thea ours are our rabbits.

755
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:19,710
Speaker 1: Oh, we only have one rabbit or movie now.

756
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,249
Speaker 1: But Theo his thing was he hated his nails getting clipped and he was mad about it.

757
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:24,518
Speaker 1: But he didn't like.

758
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:29,304
Speaker 1: when we clipped his nails It wasn't like he'd bite us while we're clipping them like panicking or anything.

759
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,590
Speaker 1: Like we'd get him clipped.

760
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:55,048
Speaker 1: he would after the nail clipping was done like make a face and Like with malice a forethought Bite us or bite a nearby thing on purpose as an act of anger and/or revenge like it was so clearly Intentional and so clearly in response to what we had done as opposed to oh, no I'm freaking out and I bit you but more like fuck you mom and dad bite

761
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:57,013
Speaker 0: What did?

762
00:55:57,174 --> 00:56:00,210
Speaker 0: what do bunnies do out in the wild if there's no one clipping their name?

763
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:03,488
Speaker 1: They only live two years out in the wild at best so they don't need it.

764
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,549
Speaker 1: Also, they wear him down by digging and scraping and stuff.

765
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:07,955
Speaker 0: Why don't you give.

766
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:10,430
Speaker 0: let him have some digging and scraping then you may even clip less often.

767
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:13,885
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but it's still not enough like clip You're still gonna have to clip at some point at least.

768
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:14,329
Speaker 1: check out him.

769
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,960
Speaker 0: Give him a diggin a diggin scraping rocks and really where isn't?

770
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,469
Speaker 1: actually you can't and that reduces how often you gotta gotta clip them.

771
00:56:20,153 --> 00:56:21,781
Speaker 1: But that's something people to underestimate too.

772
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,469
Speaker 1: Like how long do you think a squirrel lives?

773
00:56:26,251 --> 00:56:36,630
Speaker 0: I mean judging by the fact that there was one black squirrel in the park nearby and I saw it for at least You know four or five years in a row it's got to be at least that much probably.

774
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could.

775
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,970
Speaker 1: they could live like especially if they don't get sick or eaten by something.

776
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:45,502
Speaker 0: I don't think there were two black squirrels in the same tree in the same park in consecutive years and it was a different one.

777
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:46,226
Speaker 1: a good observation.

778
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:51,126
Speaker 1: they can live like 14 to 20 years if they're well cared for like rabbits still like in the wild.

779
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:55,303
Speaker 1: they make it like a year Maybe two just because it's so dangerous to be a rabbit in a house.

780
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:56,649
Speaker 1: They can live more than ten years.

781
00:56:56,689 --> 00:57:04,030
Speaker 1: Just fine Okay Put a human naked out in the woods and got to survive on your own your whole life.

782
00:57:04,532 --> 00:57:05,475
Speaker 1: Not that likely.

783
00:57:05,495 --> 00:57:07,743
Speaker 1: you're gonna make it past like 30-something probably.

784
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:09,189
Speaker 0: Well, not a domesticated human.

785
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:14,305
Speaker 0: but is that rabbit that lives two years in the wild like dying on its own?

786
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:16,453
Speaker 0: or is it cuz it got eaten if Never gets?

787
00:57:16,573 --> 00:57:18,821
Speaker 0: if it if it doesn't got eaten by anything.

788
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, how long will it go for?

789
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:28,630
Speaker 1: Not eaten but also like malnutrition or just like they are more susceptible to illnesses when they get older just like humans are.

790
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:40,933
Speaker 1: Like if I eat some rotting meat when I was 15 I could probably survive that if I had a bunch of rotting meat today I might not look so good compared to how I would have handled that when I was 17.

791
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:47,522
Speaker 0: Eat some rotting meat when you're your 60s like yeah Yeah, I don't know if you know the building we're in now.

792
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,230
Speaker 0: actually you can bring a pet here.

793
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,740
Speaker 0: They actually only charge.

794
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,022
Speaker 0: they don't.

795
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:54,670
Speaker 0: a lot of buildings in the city They want to make you have a pet fee where you can all the time.

796
00:57:55,071 --> 00:58:00,870
Speaker 0: This building just has pet deposit where you pay one time and they just told that money like that and that's your pet doesn't?

797
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,356
Speaker 1: That's fairly fair.

798
00:58:02,758 --> 00:58:05,450
Speaker 0: I'm a building is the building's full of pets.

799
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:08,628
Speaker 0: There's you know this dog and as long as your pet doesn't make trouble they don't give a shit.

800
00:58:08,728 --> 00:58:09,050
Speaker 0: our building.

801
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:10,796
Speaker 0: There's also a size limit.

802
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:11,761
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know what it is.

803
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:17,349
Speaker 1: pets are technically not allowed in our building But there are a lot of pets in our building cuz the super literally doesn't care at all.

804
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,735
Speaker 1: But we're looking around.

805
00:58:19,755 --> 00:58:27,405
Speaker 1: there's some pet friendly buildings in the area and Rents are way down in this neighborhood like right now for a short time.

806
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:31,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a Yeah better leave now.

807
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:33,196
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like I don't know.

808
00:58:33,216 --> 00:58:33,738
Speaker 0: What do we?

809
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:35,930
Speaker 0: you know Amanda had like corgis?

810
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,479
Speaker 0: I guess her parents just keep getting more for some reason.

811
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they're they're losing it.

812
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:43,916
Speaker 1: I mean all like most ever of my family.

813
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:46,783
Speaker 1: Just keep getting pets cuz just I don't know pet.

814
00:58:46,843 --> 00:58:48,509
Speaker 0: It's like should I get one.

815
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:49,814
Speaker 0: It's like on the one hand.

816
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:52,788
Speaker 0: Maybe yes, but on the other hand It's like I.

817
00:58:52,808 --> 00:58:58,294
Speaker 1: you know if you two had a pet It would be a very enriching experience cuz it's still a pain in the ass.

818
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,580
Speaker 0: the problem is like a pain in the ass.

819
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,829
Speaker 0: Oh, it is invention.

820
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,140
Speaker 0: someone's got to watch the pet.

821
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:07,380
Speaker 1: I mean think of it this way though like if you had a kid that's a lot more responsibility.

822
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,783
Speaker 0: No, no We're not doing that.

823
00:59:08,823 --> 00:59:09,806
Speaker 0: forget that nonsense.

824
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:12,093
Speaker 1: think about it as like it.

825
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:17,392
Speaker 1: you get some of those kinds of benefits And some of that pain in the ass, but it's way less.

826
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,316
Speaker 0: one in someone's.

827
00:59:18,376 --> 00:59:19,360
Speaker 0: one person works at night.

828
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh great.

829
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:21,288
Speaker 0: So I got to take care.

830
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,698
Speaker 0: I got to do all the pet taking care of is you know?

831
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:25,739
Speaker 0: Well, we just split money's not a problem.

832
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:30,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I uh, well if someone we have one imagine if you were only awake at like night.

833
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:34,600
Speaker 1: Well, you could get a patty that is of crepuscular and is awake both times.

834
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,652
Speaker 0: You got it, but you can't take it to the vet at night.

835
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:41,392
Speaker 1: or you know, yeah You shouldn't have to take it to the vet.

836
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:47,240
Speaker 0: that often I'm just saying is that the responsibilities of take, you know, you got you get a dog, right?

837
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,719
Speaker 0: You're you're not walking it, you know, well morning, right?

838
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:50,924
Speaker 1: Well, that's the like.

839
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:52,954
Speaker 1: if we got a dog because one person's

840
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:56,068
Speaker 0: doing several dog walks The other person is doing not so much

841
00:59:56,088 --> 01:00:06,460
Speaker 1: like because we both work and it's not like eventually cope It'll be a post-covid time where we're out of the house all the time Like I would probably literally drop a dog off at doggy daycare all day every day while we were at work.

842
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:08,940
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, doggy daycare is nice.

843
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,889
Speaker 0: I actually saw a photo today of like, you know the world's I Assume the world's best dog walker.

844
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:16,240
Speaker 0: There's like the semi-famous dog walker in the city.

845
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,891
Speaker 0: They walk like a huge pile of dogs at once.

846
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,840
Speaker 0: It's sort of amazing, but they only they're very picky.

847
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,360
Speaker 0: They're like they won't walk the dog unless it's like the best dog.

848
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:35,446
Speaker 0: So it's like this person's walking around with like the 10 or 11 best dogs that meet their approval all at once, you know But rather more than once a day.

849
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:44,041
Speaker 1: probably like not just because I really like rabbits like because you know Every type of animal like whatever kind of pet you're gonna get you just have to learn about that kind of animal like.

850
01:00:44,101 --> 01:00:53,949
Speaker 1: I had to learn a lot about rabbits about a decade ago when we got two little bunnies because I didn't know a lot about rabbits, but Rabbits are very Specifically good as New York pets.

851
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:58,309
Speaker 1: just because they're silent They don't really cause a bunch of damage.

852
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,635
Speaker 1: They're litter trainable.

853
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:00,620
Speaker 1: Like they'll just you can just train them.

854
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,531
Speaker 1: They'll just go in a litter box.

855
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,239
Speaker 1: Just like a cat would.

856
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:05,009
Speaker 1: Their poop doesn't smell like anything at all.

857
01:01:05,069 --> 01:01:07,400
Speaker 1: Like the poop like if their pee smells a little in the litter box.

858
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:09,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, does your apartment?

859
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:11,235
Speaker 0: your apartment didn't smell like poop ever.

860
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:12,058
Speaker 0: It smelled like hay.

861
01:01:12,078 --> 01:01:14,532
Speaker 1: Yep That hay is a very fairly pleasant smell.

862
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:15,920
Speaker 1: It's like it almost smells like matcha like.

863
01:01:18,422 --> 01:01:20,410
Speaker 0: I'd rather not smell the hay, but there's.

864
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:20,652
Speaker 0: it's.

865
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:21,455
Speaker 0: you know, it's not.

866
01:01:21,656 --> 01:01:22,821
Speaker 0: it's not a bad smell Like.

867
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,045
Speaker 1: I mean go to like my house.

868
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:28,820
Speaker 1: when we were kids the house smelled like dogs because we had dogs dog house.

869
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:34,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would rather hay smell than dog smell but I would still rather no smell than hay smell.

870
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's just especially during COVID.

871
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,615
Speaker 1: Just having a little guy like mooching around the house has been a very enriching like.

872
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:43,586
Speaker 1: it honestly helped us Just stay sane during this whole experience.

873
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:53,642
Speaker 1: I only worry that he's gonna be mad if we start going to work again Because he's really used to like I'll be working and he'll just like wake up and come into the computer room and be like, hey What's up?

874
01:01:54,706 --> 01:01:58,943
Speaker 0: I Didn't really work out too.

875
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:03,759
Speaker 0: Well, but I think in our lifetime we could have a robot dog that doesn't suck.

876
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:06,185
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's possibility.

877
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:09,013
Speaker 1: Look at how many people are emotionally attached to their Roombas like.

878
01:02:09,274 --> 01:02:09,695
Speaker 1: seriously.

879
01:02:09,735 --> 01:02:17,991
Speaker 0: I'm not even joking like that's a thing Yeah, and it's like it's not even to say that like you might be thinking like, oh, you know You just want the robot dog because you're lazy.

880
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,560
Speaker 0: It's like well, hold on a second.

881
01:02:19,661 --> 01:02:30,180
Speaker 0: There are people who are lazy who don't want to have to take care of it as much But there's also people who might need the companionship of a pet but are incapable of taking care of it.

882
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:40,540
Speaker 1: that feels of AI driven Companion is a big field of study Especially for people who are very old who might be experiencing cognitive deficits.

883
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:48,699
Speaker 0: I'm seeing very senior or disabled person can you know be helped a great deal by like a nice doggo Yeah, but they can't take care of the doggo.

884
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:53,760
Speaker 0: So suddenly now if they want to have one they got to have money to have someone else take care of the doggo.

885
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:55,388
Speaker 0: And it's like it's a whole thing.

886
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,298
Speaker 0: But you know, what solves that robot doggo.

887
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:02,280
Speaker 0: Yeah At least it has to be good enough though that it actually, you know serves the purpose.

888
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:08,357
Speaker 1: But I uh, I think it's because having pets is also something that's very.

889
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,240
Speaker 1: it's not uniquely human.

890
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:15,577
Speaker 1: There are other animals that have done similar husbandry type things But humans like weak and well because we've killed time enough.

891
01:03:15,618 --> 01:03:18,104
Speaker 1: on this episode We co-evolved

892
01:03:18,144 --> 01:03:18,846
Speaker 0: with dogs

893
01:03:18,926 --> 01:03:33,218
Speaker 1: like we've made dogs over time like they evolved with us and we kind of made them More able to socialize with us in a really interesting weird way Which is part of why I think dogs are the most common most popular like just out there.

894
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:37,119
Speaker 1: pet Mm-hmm cats are a decent number two.

895
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got horses too.

896
01:03:39,646 --> 01:03:40,830
Speaker 1: But what about the ethical concerns?

897
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:52,037
Speaker 1: What if you have an AI robot dog that can learn and Eventually starts to get to the level of Apparent intelligence of a small animal a real one?

898
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:52,600
Speaker 1: then what?

899
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,684
Speaker 0: Good, it'll live forever.

900
01:03:54,704 --> 01:03:55,587
Speaker 0: It'll be friggin awesome.

901
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what did you?

902
01:03:57,353 --> 01:03:59,080
Speaker 1: can you throw it away now ethics start coming in?

903
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:00,482
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

904
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:02,498
Speaker 0: if you throw I mean, it'll be able to take care of us all.

905
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,319
Speaker 1: All right, we don't even have to find food.

906
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:08,240
Speaker 1: We killed enough time.

907
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:14,346
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go give my little rabbit in there some pellets and a couple crazins and then I'm gonna Watch the Rangers.

908
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:15,008
Speaker 1: I don't know.

909
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:16,956
Speaker 1: I was about to say lose, but I don't know.

910
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:17,840
Speaker 1: I don't know how this game will go.

911
01:04:18,382 --> 01:04:19,144
Speaker 0: It's the Flyers will.

912
01:04:19,164 --> 01:04:22,154
Speaker 1: probably I feel like we'll win but you know what it'll.

913
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:26,429
Speaker 1: probably I'll bet it'll be a moderate blowout But not a crazy blowout like four to one is my game.

914
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:34,160
Speaker 1: We really we really did bad things to them I know but I feel like they had to have studied those games like what were we doing?

915
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,017
Speaker 1: But it might be like like we are with Ovi like.

916
01:04:37,279 --> 01:04:41,498
Speaker 0: well I could go so I can go so I can go watch the counter-strike world championships a thousand times.

917
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:43,886
Speaker 1: Yeah Like everyone knows Ovi.

918
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:44,529
Speaker 1: He's there.

919
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,780
Speaker 1: He goes to that spot and then he scores a goal.

920
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,308
Speaker 1: Just don't let him go to that spot.

921
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:51,578
Speaker 1: and then they scores the goal from that spot and the coach is like What did I fucking say?

922
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,785
Speaker 1: Do you want to watch the video again?

923
01:04:54,046 --> 01:04:54,468
Speaker 1: Here it is.

924
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:55,332

Speaker 1: Here's 10,000 OV's overlay.

926
01:04:57,562 --> 01:04:58,894
Speaker 1: They all go to the same spot and score a goal.

927
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,378

945
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:35,131
Speaker 0: And that's when she realized the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her.
