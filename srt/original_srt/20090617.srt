1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,505
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, June 17th.

2
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,166
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:12,707
Speaker 1: I'm Rip.

4
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,430
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:25,891
Speaker 0: Tonight, the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, Arts Festival 2009.

6
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,623
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:32,000
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh, shoes.

8
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:33,090
Speaker 0: Oh god.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,335
Speaker 1: Randomly, we both did something related to shoes today.

10
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:37,116
Speaker 1: Yeah.

11
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:37,717
Speaker 1: Independently.

12
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:42,145
Speaker 1: I mean, I've been wearing- I have these like 15 year old boots that I wear almost every day.

13
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:44,049
Speaker 1: Like I wear them in place of dress shoes.

14
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:44,750
Speaker 1: I love these boots.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,071
Speaker 1: They're super comfortable.

16
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:47,492
Speaker 1: They're like black leather, biker boots.

17
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:47,893
Speaker 1: They're great.

18
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:50,775
Speaker 1: And I periodically maintain them.

19
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:53,838
Speaker 1: They've been rehealed like five or six times, resold a couple times.

20
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:55,199
Speaker 1: I've had leather worked onto them.

21
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,380
Speaker 1: I mink oil them all the time.

22
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:59,924
Speaker 0: And they were getting real- Does that mink oil come from real minks?

23
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:02,046
Speaker 1: Actually, yes, it does.

24
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:02,526
Speaker 1: Sadly.

25
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:03,967
Speaker 0: How do you get the oil from the mink?

26
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:06,750
Speaker 0: You just kind of grab a mink and kind of rub it and the oil comes out?

27
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,835
Speaker 1: I have these horrible images of squeezing them like a rag.

28
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:12,278
Speaker 0: Why would you squeeze it?

29
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:13,380
Speaker 0: You could just sort of stroke it.

30
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,703
Speaker 0: I mean, they're all oily, right?

31
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:18,790
Speaker 0: Because it's like, you know, the way humans have oil in their hair, the minks have oil in their fur, right?

32
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,414
Speaker 1: Traditionally, I believe they kill them and take a gland out.

33
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:22,015
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

34
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,557
Speaker 0: All I know is that- Why would you do that?

35
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:26,222
Speaker 0: If you leave the gland in, the gland keeps working and making more oil.

36
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:30,930
Speaker 1: All I know is that I bought mink oil a long time ago before I knew that they really made it out of minks.

37
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,188
Speaker 0: Well, you know, duct tape is made of ducts.

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:42,530
Speaker 1: I have not run out yet, but once I finally run out, I'm going to buy synthetic mink oil, which I found out also works better than real mink oil.

39
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,372
Speaker 0: See, that's one thing, right?

40
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:56,370
Speaker 0: There's like some cases where like the real deal is like we can't beat it, but in cases where you can beat the real deal with something synthetic, why does the real deal even still exist?

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,496
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, look at diamonds.

42
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:08,664
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I finally, you know, I was sitting there at work today and someone looks at my shoes and they're like, "Your shoes are looking pretty

43
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:08,985
Speaker 1: ratty.".

44
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,710
Speaker 1: And I look at them and you know, yeah, they were getting kind of ratty because I hadn't maintained them in a while.

45
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:20,599
Speaker 1: So I went to the cobbler, the underground central, because I happen to have an extra pair of shoes with me at work for unrelated reasons.

46
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,221
Speaker 1: So I switched shoes.

47
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,884
Speaker 1: I walk over and I'm like, "Can you fix

48
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:25,345
Speaker 1: these?".

49
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,388
Speaker 1: And he was like, "You haven't been taking care of these, have you?

50
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:29,149
Speaker 1: Look how dry they

51
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:29,349
Speaker 1: are.".

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,252
Speaker 1: And he basically gave me the Jerry Seinfeld treatment for a few minutes.

53
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:40,677
Speaker 1: And then he's like, "Do you even like these boots?

54
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,038
Speaker 1: I mean, you got to oil

55
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:42,138
Speaker 1: them.".

56
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:42,879
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "I know.

57
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:43,459
Speaker 1: Can you oil

58
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:43,579
Speaker 1: them?".

59
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,660
Speaker 1: He's like, "But are you going to oil them when I give them

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:45,881
Speaker 1: back?".

61
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:46,921
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Yes, I'm going to oil

62
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:47,021
Speaker 1: them.".

63
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,682
Speaker 1: He's like, "What kind of

64
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:47,922
Speaker 1: oil?".

65
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,422
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Mink

66
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:48,643
Speaker 1: oil.".

67
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:49,863
Speaker 1: He's like, "Okay,

68
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:51,344
Speaker 1: $26.".

69
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,406
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Fine, here's

70
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:53,506
Speaker 1: $26.".

71
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,008
Speaker 1: And he re-healed and now my shoes look great.

72
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:58,870
Speaker 1: That's it.

73
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,510
Speaker 1: That's what I got.

74
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,965
Speaker 0: So it's been raining pretty much constantly here.

75
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,590
Speaker 0: It's probably going to rain again, I think.

76
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,890
Speaker 1: Did you look at the forecast?

77
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,336
Speaker 1: Rain.

78
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,900
Speaker 1: I looked at the forecast for the entire week at work today.

79
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,730
Speaker 1: It will rain every day through Sunday.

80
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,476
Speaker 0: I planted this tomato plant weeks ago.

81
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,401
Speaker 0: I have not watered it by hand.

82
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,710
Speaker 0: I watered it by hand once because it's rained every day.

83
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:26,603
Speaker 0: It's not raining non-stop, but every 24 hours it rains.

84
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,048
Speaker 0: It's like, "Flo, are we in Florida here?

85
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:28,449
Speaker 0: What's going

86
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:28,609
Speaker 0: on?".

87
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:29,590
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

88
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,087
Speaker 0: I know.

89
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:40,907
Speaker 0: I came out of my building this morning, not this morning, after work, and some sort of crazy, homeless-ish, some bum-type person.

90
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,957
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure if he was an actual bum or just bum-like.

91
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,088
Speaker 0: He made a comment to someone to a...

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:50,889
Speaker 1: A hobo?

93
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:51,827
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

94
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:52,336
Speaker 1: A hobbit?

95
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:55,406
Speaker 0: A loiterer, right?

96
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:57,808
Speaker 1: So a bum?

97
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:58,832
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

98
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:02,550
Speaker 0: The loiterer was like a business guy who was just leaning against the building smoking or whatever.

99
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,285
Speaker 0: And he's like... And the bum was like, "How about that global

100
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:06,807
Speaker 0: warming?".

101
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,146
Speaker 0: And the loiterer was like, "Ain't none of that

102
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:10,387
Speaker 0: here.".

103
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,946
Speaker 0: So I've been clever and sort of avoided most of the rains.

104
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:18,970
Speaker 0: I got an umbrella.

105
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,180
Speaker 0: It's not that... I had a hoodie.

106
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,230
Speaker 0: I never got wet.

107
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,495
Speaker 1: I wouldn't really classify that as clever.

108
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:25,218
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy.

109
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,150
Speaker 1: Humans have been avoiding rain for as long as there have been humans.

110
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,870
Speaker 0: But two or three days ago, I think two days ago, when I left work... Three days ago, when I left work, right?

111
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,320
Speaker 0: It was raining crazily, and all I had was a hoodie.

112
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,126
Speaker 0: So I just... What could I do?

113
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,150
Speaker 0: I had to go to the train.

114
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,799
Speaker 0: The sooner I got to the train, the better.

115
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,530
Speaker 0: So I just went through the rain.

116
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:50,430
Speaker 0: I got as least wet as possible, which was soaking wet, including my shoes.

117
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,510
Speaker 0: And then I put my hoodie and my such in the laundry room with the fan on overnight.

118
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:58,297
Speaker 0: So they dried out.

119
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,690
Speaker 0: And luckily, it wasn't raining back in Beacon.

120
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:04,770
Speaker 1: Is this going anywhere?

121
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I keep going because I'm just sort of trying to remember what happened there.

122
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,610
Speaker 1: Basically... This must be a fascinating story.

123
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,121
Speaker 0: No, it's not fascinating whatsoever.

124
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,290
Speaker 0: I don't even waste my time.

125
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:17,003
Speaker 0: The shoes are still wet the next day.

126
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,069
Speaker 0: It sucked.

127
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,257
Speaker 0: And I sort of, you know, it made me think about my shoes.

128
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:24,968
Speaker 0: And I looked at them and I'm like, "Damn, I bought these like a long time

129
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:25,209
Speaker 0: ago.".

130
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,930
Speaker 0: I should buy some new ones because these are actually sort of...

131
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,996
Speaker 1: So I take it you did.

132
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,430
Speaker 1: And that's what was in that box on the front porch.

133
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,789
Speaker 0: So I went to Zappos.com and I bought some new shoes.

134
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:46,130
Speaker 0: And the thing is, right, like back in the day, whenever I had to buy shoes, like, you know, like I really... It was never difficult for me to buy clothes or anything.

135
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:52,470
Speaker 0: But for some reason, shoes are always difficult because like they didn't fit or they're too short or too long.

136
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,191
Speaker 0: Right.

137
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:58,230
Speaker 0: And it just it was the fitting problem, you know, and I'd go to shoe stores and there'd be nothing good.

138
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,864
Speaker 0: Or there'd be a bunch of like ugly shoes there.

139
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:01,809
Speaker 0: Who knows what was going on.

140
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:05,290
Speaker 0: And so, you know, I had all this trouble.

141
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,030
Speaker 0: But the shoes that I just the ones that I'm getting rid of that got wet.

142
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:10,692
Speaker 0: Right.

143
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,190
Speaker 0: Those I bought at Zappos.com and they showed up.

144
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:15,422
Speaker 1: You sounded like an ad here.

145
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:15,867
Speaker 0: I know.

146
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:16,150
Speaker 1: Right.

147
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,609
Speaker 1: The worst thing is that's the only place I buy shoes from.

148
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:19,615
Speaker 0: I know.

149
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:19,777
Speaker 0: Right.

150
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:21,090
Speaker 0: And they were perfect.

151
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,130
Speaker 0: It's like I didn't even try them on until I got them and paid for them already.

152
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,691
Speaker 0: Perfect.

153
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,430
Speaker 0: So I go and I did the same thing and they're perfect.

154
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,695
Speaker 0: They're probably the shoes.

155
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:34,930
Speaker 0: I put them on and immediately I put them on and I was like, oh, my God, these feel like they're not brand new.

156
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:46,050
Speaker 1: Those new shoes are actually they're strange to me because they have the top like the of a high top, like they look and feel exactly like an old school basketball playing high top like I used to wear.

157
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,835
Speaker 0: Well, they're married.

158
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,378
Speaker 0: See, that's the thing.

159
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:49,090
Speaker 1: But they're not high tops.

160
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,322
Speaker 1: They're mid tops, but they have a high top top.

161
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:52,770
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

162
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,450
Speaker 1: It's their their marital cats and dogs living together.

163
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,530
Speaker 0: See, my dad was all like, oh, you get the Merrill and I'm like, yeah, Merrill, Merrill, what the fuck is that?

164
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,407
Speaker 0: I just stick with my new balance.

165
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:02,689
Speaker 0: Right.

166
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,730
Speaker 1: So I actually I remember I was wearing some of the earliest new balance tennis shoes.

167
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:09,538
Speaker 1: They were so expensive.

168
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:10,463
Speaker 1: I was like middle school.

169
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,670
Speaker 1: But for some reason I got them.

170
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,589
Speaker 1: They were suede pigskin.

171
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

172
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:16,710
Speaker 0: So I used to be on Nike and then I was new balance.

173
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:17,032
Speaker 0: Right.

174
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,930
Speaker 0: But then, you know, my dad had been like, Merrill, Merrill, Merrill.

175
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,696
Speaker 0: And I was like, whatever.

176
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,470
Speaker 0: So my boots died.

177
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,209
Speaker 0: The boots I had, you know, from before.

178
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:28,149
Speaker 0: So I went to EMS and I was like, I saw the Merrill's there and I was like, huh?

179
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,144
Speaker 0: And I put them on and I was like, whoa, shit.

180
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,763
Speaker 0: And they were expensive, like over one hundred dollars.

181
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,130
Speaker 0: But, whoa, shit.

182
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,970
Speaker 0: And they were like, they're serious business.

183
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:38,456
Speaker 0: And I investigated in.

184
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:41,570
Speaker 0: Merrill is sort of like a yuppie outdoorsy kind of brand.

185
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,129
Speaker 0: And they're sort of high end in an apple kind of way.

186
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:53,478
Speaker 0: You know, in that like any anytime EMS is a sale, it always one hundred percent of the time excludes all Merrill products.

187
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:54,986
Speaker 0: Like you get a coupon from EMS.

188
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:55,770
Speaker 0: Look at the fine print.

189
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,390
Speaker 0: It says not good on Merrill products because they're so fancy.

190
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,628
Speaker 0: They won't discount them for any reason, you know.

191
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:08,750
Speaker 0: But at the same time, there's a reason that they are awesomely and incredibly high quality.

192
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:18,570
Speaker 0: So when I went to Zappos, I saw that Merrill actually has two different kinds of sneakers that are most of their stuff is sort of outdoorsy boot sandal leathery stuff.

193
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,357
Speaker 1: So, Scott, here's the real question.

194
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,930
Speaker 1: Do these shoes match your handbag?

195
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:24,908
Speaker 0: That's enough of that.

196
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,010
Speaker 1: I mean, you spend so much time telling the story and obviously you spend so much time looking for shoes.

197
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,589
Speaker 1: And that was why we were running late to the shore at Otacon all those years ago.

198
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,969
Speaker 1: Pete and I are trying to look at video games and go, but now you had to buy shoes.

199
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:38,150
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

200
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,236
Speaker 0: I didn't have it.

201
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:43,890
Speaker 0: And then when we got back from the shore, I went to Zappos and I bought those new balances.

202
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:45,639
Speaker 0: And those are all those new balances.

203
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,269
Speaker 1: are those kind of match the handbag.

204
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:48,792
Speaker 0: Right.

205
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:53,210
Speaker 1: So, listeners, which of our stories was more boring?

206
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,170
Speaker 0: They were both the most boring stories in the universe.

207
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,249
Speaker 1: Let's get on to non boring stuff.

208
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,660
Speaker 1: Otacon, we are going to be there.

209
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:01,230
Speaker 1: We're doing at least three panels.

210
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,318
Speaker 0: That is a big surprise.

211
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:02,963
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

212
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:03,990
Speaker 0: The listeners are shocked.

213
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,193
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

214
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:06,018
Speaker 0: We're going to Otacon.

215
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:06,742
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

216
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,070
Speaker 0: I didn't see that one coming.

217
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,222
Speaker 1: We're doing three panels.

218
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:11,570
Speaker 1: Three of these panels.

219
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:12,708
Speaker 1: Caught it off.

220
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:13,330
Speaker 1: Caught it off.

221
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:13,810
Speaker 1: Three kinds.

222
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:14,290
Speaker 0: Three kinds.

223
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,809
Speaker 1: All I really want to say is that two.

224
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:24,590
Speaker 1: If you saw one of our panels three at Anime Boston, we are doing the exact same panels at Otacon.

225
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:25,763
Speaker 1: Anime should see.

226
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:29,130
Speaker 1: Know your creators beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

227
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,890
Speaker 0: If you saw us at Anime Boston, do not come to our panels at Otacon unless you really like rerun.

228
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,283
Speaker 1: Well, do not come to any of them except know your creators, because we have completely revamped it.

229
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:43,010
Speaker 1: again is the third kind.

230
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:49,230
Speaker 0: So if you like to see it, you like to see the same thing repeated in a different way.

231
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:50,908
Speaker 0: We have one panel for you.

232
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:57,910
Speaker 1: But there is much more exciting news from Otacon than the fact that we are going to be there doing panels like we always do.

233
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:04,830
Speaker 1: So remember the best concert Otacon ever had, which was L'arc en Ciel hide performing.

234
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,610
Speaker 0: I was going to make a joke, but I guess not performing at the arena.

235
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,630
Speaker 1: It was like a full on concert.

236
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,670
Speaker 1: The entire band came.

237
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:14,650
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

238
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,469
Speaker 0: I was trying to remember the name of the girl who pretended to play guitar and I was going to say her name.

239
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:20,069
Speaker 1: I forgot her name, too.

240
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:21,490
Speaker 1: But Muck played.

241
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:22,270
Speaker 1: It was Muck, right?

242
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:22,949
Speaker 1: They played after her.

243
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were all right.

244
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:24,409
Speaker 1: They were hardcore.

245
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,190
Speaker 1: I liked them a lot.

246
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,410
Speaker 1: But Otacon, I mean, they always get really good concerts, but that was kind of a peak of concerts.

247
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:33,370
Speaker 1: That was unprecedented and crazy.

248
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,910
Speaker 0: TMR was pretty crazy.

249
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,350
Speaker 1: TMR was pretty crazy.

250
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,429
Speaker 1: L'arc was just like the next step up from that.

251
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:50,530
Speaker 1: Well, Hyde is coming back to Otacon, not to do a concert at Otacon, but it just so happens that the band he's working with now, Vamps.

252
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:54,090
Speaker 0: That sounds a little bit emo, vampire type.

253
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,630
Speaker 1: Is going to be doing a concert in Baltimore on the Thursday of the Otacon weekend.

254
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,290
Speaker 1: Baltimore?

255
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,850
Speaker 1: Thursday, July 16th at Sonar Baltimore.

256
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,870
Speaker 1: Vamps is going to be doing a full on for real concert as part of their world tour.

257
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,650
Speaker 0: I knew they were touring in the US, but I was not aware of this Baltimore show or the Otacon timing.

258
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,867
Speaker 1: Now, not only that, if you're not going to Otacon, right, they're performing in D.C.

259
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:22,710
Speaker 1: just before that.

260
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:25,169
Speaker 1: They're going to be in Hartford, Connecticut before that.

261
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,309
Speaker 1: They're going to be in New York City before that.

262
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,830
Speaker 0: That's a big ass tour, going to Hartford.

263
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,888
Speaker 0: I mean, Hartford, no one's going to come see you.

264
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,670
Speaker 0: Where are they playing in Hartford?

265
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:37,170
Speaker 1: They're playing in Hartford at the Warped Tour New England Dodge Music Center.

266
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,367
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a Warped Tour, OK.

267
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,489
Speaker 1: But they're also going to be in San Diego.

268
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,490
Speaker 0: If you're just in Connecticut alone, you're better off going to New Haven than Hartford.

269
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,092
Speaker 1: L.A.,

270
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:49,350
Speaker 1: they're doing it in Vegas, but they're also going to have their official party there in Vegas.

271
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:51,154
Speaker 1: So all sorts of stuff.

272
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:53,206
Speaker 1: They're going to be in New York City on July 11th.

273
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:54,849
Speaker 0: Well, we don't have time for that.

274
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,690
Speaker 1: No, but we're most likely going to see them on Thursday at Otacon because we go to Otacon like Thursday morning.

275
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,549
Speaker 1: We're always there by noon.

276
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:03,305
Speaker 0: You know, he wants to go back to Baltimore.

277
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:03,809
Speaker 0: You know why?

278
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:04,906
Speaker 1: He can have two.

279
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,097
Speaker 0: He can have two crab.

280
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,690
Speaker 0: He want to eat the crab.

281
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:09,269
Speaker 0: That's why he go back.

282
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,250
Speaker 1: So if you're going to Otacon, tickets for this concert are like 30 bucks and it's a for real concert.

283
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,009
Speaker 0: It's cheaper than an Otacon ticket.

284
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,410
Speaker 1: Now, because here's the deal.

285
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,530
Speaker 0: This that was and many people have bought Otacon tickets to see the same person, which cost more.

286
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:25,374
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,889
Speaker 0: And that's the only thing they wanted to say.

288
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,830
Speaker 0: There was an update.

289
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:38,490
Speaker 1: Apparently, Vance has decided to change the schedule and stay in Baltimore one more day just so that they can also appear for a panel and signings and stuff at Otacon.

290
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,590
Speaker 1: Oh, they're going to be at Otacon on Friday with autographs and they're going to do a panel and supposedly all sorts of crazy stuff.

291
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:51,730
Speaker 1: But the only way to guarantee access to the panel is to go to the concert.

292
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,850
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

293
00:12:55,452 --> 00:13:01,190
Speaker 0: That's sort of crazy because it's like anyone who's awesome enough to get there Thursday and go to the concert.

294
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,590
Speaker 0: It's like they give you a double bonus.

295
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,490
Speaker 0: So it's like people who are like huge fans, but I can't make it Thursday.

296
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,310
Speaker 0: It's like, well, you're either double bonus or you're double screwed.

297
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:22,690
Speaker 1: But it's so like at the same time, the what always saddens me at anime conventions is that I'll see the fact that cons basically have to bribe people to go to the panels of the cool Japanese guests.

298
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:25,810
Speaker 1: But yet people line up for four hours to get their stupid autograph.

299
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,230
Speaker 0: I don't understand autographs at period.

300
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,450
Speaker 1: It's one thing like I can understand getting a cool autograph.

301
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,690
Speaker 1: I mean, remember when I got Magic Johnson to sign that Super Mario Brothers thing?

302
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,550
Speaker 0: But that was not waiting in line for an autograph.

303
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:38,270
Speaker 0: That was a special situation.

304
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,810
Speaker 0: That was, you know, it's not the autograph that matters.

305
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:43,630
Speaker 0: It is the thing that the event that occurred.

306
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,230
Speaker 0: But if you had waited in line and Magic Johnson would have signed a piece of paper, it wouldn't mean shit.

307
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,670
Speaker 1: Man, you know, I wish someone had filmed that because that would have been on YouTube.

308
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,190
Speaker 1: I could have done something with that, but I've still got the autograph.

309
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,449
Speaker 1: If I can just get Captain Lou Albano to sign it.

310
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,860
Speaker 0: He appeared at.

311
00:13:59,444 --> 00:14:00,210
Speaker 0: I forget where he appeared.

312
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,130
Speaker 1: I didn't want to stand in line.

313
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:11,470
Speaker 1: But anyway, many cons now do a thing where they give you a token to if you go to the panel for a Japanese guest and without that token, you don't get an autograph.

314
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,890
Speaker 1: And I feel like this is a fairly elegant solution.

315
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:24,730
Speaker 1: If you care, the majority of the people who care about Hyde or Vamps or Kaz are going to go to this concert because almost everyone who cares about Otacon gets there Thursday.

316
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,899
Speaker 1: So we're going to be at this concert.

317
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,250
Speaker 1: I recommend all of you go to this concert.

318
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:33,350
Speaker 1: Live music is almost always worth it.

319
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,530
Speaker 1: Even if you don't particularly like the genre of music, live music, it's always awesome.

320
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:38,810
Speaker 1: Unless it's Fantomas.

321
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,010
Speaker 0: You know what I would do if I was a convention-y person, right?

322
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:44,208
Speaker 1: What would you do?

323
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,770
Speaker 0: Well, because basically the autographs come in two styles, right?

324
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,730
Speaker 0: There's the free autograph, which is wait in line and just sign, sign, sign, right?

325
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:56,330
Speaker 0: And there's the sort of pay autograph where you pay a whole bunch of money to get the rare person, right?

326
00:14:56,731 --> 00:15:03,810
Speaker 0: If I was someone that people wanted the autograph of, what I would do is I would say, okay, if you want my autograph, right?

327
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,470
Speaker 0: What you have to do is you have to purchase a thing, right?

328
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,770
Speaker 0: So it would be my merchandise.

329
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:11,650
Speaker 0: You'd be like, you'd be like, you can choose a T-shirt or a book or whatever I'm selling, right?

330
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:14,550
Speaker 0: And so you're not actually paying for the autograph.

331
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,530
Speaker 0: You're buying a merch from me, right?

332
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:24,310
Speaker 0: And then by buying that merch from me, I will spend like two minutes or so talking to you.

333
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,770
Speaker 0: So it's not just hi, sign, goodbye, right?

334
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:35,150
Speaker 0: And if you're, I can tell after two minutes talking to you, if you're actually a fan or if you're just some eBay schmuck or whatever.

335
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,049
Speaker 0: And if you're just some eBay schmuck, I just won't sign your shit.

336
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:40,750
Speaker 0: You know, you bought my merch and you got your two minutes with me.

337
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,648
Speaker 0: That's what you're paying for.

338
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,310
Speaker 0: The autograph is just if I like you, right?

339
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,730
Speaker 0: So there's no guarantee of the autograph, right?

340
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,529
Speaker 0: It's just, you know, you're paying for merch and talking to me.

341
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:58,070
Speaker 0: So fans will be thrilled because their merch and talking to me is worth a million times more than my name on a stupid piece of paper.

342
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,069
Speaker 0: eBay dudes will hate me.

343
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:02,030
Speaker 0: They won't get my autograph, right?

344
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:10,670
Speaker 0: But I'll still, if a fan is an awesome fan, which I'll figure out from talking to them, I will sign something which is not part of, it's not something they purchase.

345
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:12,528
Speaker 0: The autograph is just me doing it because I want to.

346
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,330
Speaker 1: So what's going to be the going rate at Oticon to get two minutes with Scott?

347
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,149
Speaker 0: Well, it's just the cost of whatever my merch is.

348
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,147
Speaker 0: So if my book is 15 bucks, my book is 15 bucks.

349
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,028
Speaker 1: I don't know, whatever.

350
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,689
Speaker 0: You know, the Geek Nights box set, whatever I'm selling, you just pay, you know, if the t-shirt's 10 bucks, the t-shirt's 10 bucks.

351
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,489
Speaker 1: Hey, remember when we were going to make that Geek Nights box set and we discovered how many- We discovered, well, you know what?

352
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:35,810
Speaker 0: We could do a Blu-ray.

353
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:37,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could.

354
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:38,930
Speaker 1: And it wasn't feasible back then.

355
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:39,507
Speaker 1: It is now.

356
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,130
Speaker 0: It was not feasible to do.

357
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:49,391
Speaker 0: You know, we could also do USB stick because, I mean, I just bought an eight gigabyte USB stick for $30.

358
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:54,549
Speaker 0: So we could get 16 gigabyte, like SD cards and use those.

359
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,990
Speaker 0: We'd have to charge a lot of money, but we could do it anyway.

360
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:02,250
Speaker 1: So one last piece of information, and this is why Oticon always kind of takes the cake.

361
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,609
Speaker 1: Oticon, for the most part, always does the right thing.

362
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:09,069
Speaker 1: They're setting up a special booth on Thursday.

363
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:17,890
Speaker 1: No details yet for people who are going to the concert to be able to pick up their badges early so they don't miss the badge pickup in the evening while they're at the concert.

364
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:20,108
Speaker 0: That is bad ass.

365
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,188
Speaker 0: That is bad ass.

366
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:29,930
Speaker 1: I'm really, I'm looking forward to this because I know that Hyde had a great time in Baltimore and I know that he is- Oticon makes sure that all those people have a great time in Baltimore.

367
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is primarily Jim Bowles being like the god of guest relations.

368
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,590
Speaker 1: That got like, if you think anyone has ever been good at guest relations, you need to meet Jim.

369
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:39,128
Speaker 1: That guy.

370
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,724
Speaker 0: But anyway.

371
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,370
Speaker 0: All right, so we got to move along here.

372
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,270
Speaker 0: We took way too much time talking about Shoes and Oticon.

373
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:45,030
Speaker 1: Shoes, oh my gosh.

374
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,489
Speaker 1: So last bit of news.

375
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:49,390
Speaker 1: We are going to be at Kineticon.

376
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,010
Speaker 1: We hadn't said anything about it yet for reasons that we're not going to get into yet to save time.

377
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,650
Speaker 1: But July 31st to August 2nd, Kineticon.

378
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,350
Speaker 1: It's a video game, webcomic, anime.

379
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,790
Speaker 0: It's the week before or after Oticon?

380
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:01,830
Speaker 0: I think it's- Two weeks after.

381
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,010
Speaker 1: I think it's Oticon, then we have the week of awesome.

382
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,329
Speaker 1: There's one weekend off and then Kineticon.

383
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:16,270
Speaker 1: One thing led to another and Kineticon is the first convention to take us up on the give Geek Knights a room to schedule as we see fit for the entire con.

384
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,550
Speaker 0: So you don't have to be like, you know, hey, when are your panels?

385
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,427
Speaker 0: What room are they in?

386
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,969
Speaker 0: There is one panel room.

387
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,469
Speaker 0: It belongs to us.

388
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:24,710
Speaker 0: It is the Geek Knights room.

389
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:32,009
Speaker 0: You can just spend the whole convention with us in this room and we will be doing things the whole convention in this room.

390
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:41,650
Speaker 1: However, we will actually have a secondary room in addition where we will have Luke Crane and all of our game masters from the front row crew and occasionally us running games.

391
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,510
Speaker 0: Is that a separate room?

392
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,250
Speaker 0: I think it's just some tables in a room.

393
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,489
Speaker 1: Well, it's in the tabletop gaming area.

394
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:53,589
Speaker 0: Yes, we will have a room of panels that is always constantly on as well as some tables in the gaming area that we own.

395
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:56,309
Speaker 1: So here's why I bring this up.

396
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:57,970
Speaker 1: Obviously, Kineticon is pretty awesome.

397
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,789
Speaker 1: We always have a good time there, especially for the gaming content, but the anime isn't too bad.

398
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:03,209
Speaker 1: But here's the deal.

399
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:07,730
Speaker 1: We have a couple of slots that we haven't finalized filling yet.

400
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:09,630
Speaker 1: So I'm not now.

401
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,310
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong.

402
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,310
Speaker 1: We are not saying, hey, send us your panel and we'll get you into Kineticon.

403
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:27,070
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that if you think you have a bad ass panel, if you think that you can impress us and you have the best thing you've got and you want to do it at Kineticon, tell us by Saturday.

404
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,430
Speaker 1: You don't have much time this Saturday.

405
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,044
Speaker 1: You know, it's Wednesday, June 17th.

406
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,329
Speaker 1: You have until Saturday, June 20th.

407
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,909
Speaker 1: And we probably will say no.

408
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,428
Speaker 1: But if you put up a good front, there's a chance we will schedule you for a panel at Kineticon.

409
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,210
Speaker 0: And you also have to be going to Kineticon.

410
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,505
Speaker 1: Yes.

411
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:44,370
Speaker 1: It's not hard to go.

412
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,608
Speaker 1: The hotels are not sold out.

413
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,895
Speaker 0: Yep.

414
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:49,210
Speaker 0: And, you know, I guess there is a free badge opportunity, right?

415
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,010
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah.

416
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,470
Speaker 1: Plus Kineticon.

417
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:51,656
Speaker 1: We haven't.

418
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:52,870
Speaker 1: you know, we're going to risk.

419
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,950
Speaker 1: Scott and I will personally be doing like at least nine or 10 of the panels.

420
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:57,388
Speaker 1: Good God.

421
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,510
Speaker 0: So maybe we shouldn't do any together.

422
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,549
Speaker 0: That way we can, you know, spread it out.

423
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:08,769
Speaker 1: So if you want to see all of our experimental stuff that we haven't done at other cons yet, it's all going to be a Kineticon.

424
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,950
Speaker 0: And lots of reruns because you need to fill in this time.

425
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:11,363
Speaker 0: Yep.

426
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:11,887
Speaker 0: Yeah.

427
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:12,670
Speaker 0: All right.

428
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:13,540
Speaker 0: One more news.

429
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,942
Speaker 1: One more.

430
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:15,949
Speaker 0: One more news.

431
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:16,261
Speaker 0: Yes.

432
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:20,270
Speaker 0: On the comic book order form this month, which it is current.

433
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:20,630
Speaker 1: DCVS?

434
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,874
Speaker 0: Well, it's the.

435
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:22,819
Speaker 0: you know, it's the it's.

436
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:24,830
Speaker 0: everyone uses the same comic book order form.

437
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,609
Speaker 0: But if you use DCVS, it's also this month.

438
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:29,528
Speaker 0: So it's June.

439
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,010
Speaker 0: So July, August.

440
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:39,050
Speaker 0: So coming out in August, Fantagraphics is putting out an Usagi Yojimbo collection.

441
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:40,270
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

442
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:54,070
Speaker 0: It is a hardcover slip case collection of the first seven volumes, 1200 pages of the beginning of Usagi Yojimbo and a fancy hardcover slip case.

443
00:20:54,932 --> 00:21:00,090
Speaker 0: And at DCVS with a discount, it is fifty dollars.

444
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,190
Speaker 1: There's really no excuse.

445
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,283
Speaker 0: This is like, I mean, think about the Hellboy library.

446
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,410
Speaker 0: editions are like thirty something on Amazon.

447
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:08,290
Speaker 0: Right.

448
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:12,169
Speaker 0: So this is this is big time action here, you know.

449
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:14,089
Speaker 0: So how can you not?

450
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:15,426
Speaker 0: You can't.

451
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:16,506
Speaker 0: So go get it.

452
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:16,946
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:19,910
Speaker 1: And also one last thing, just because it is noteworthy.

454
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,350
Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk about it, obviously, but Hayao Miyazaki is going to be in the U.S.

455
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:26,002
Speaker 1: in California on July 28th.

456
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,569
Speaker 0: The rumor is he's going to make a secret appearance in Anime Expo, but I don't think so.

457
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:31,745
Speaker 1: I highly doubt that.

458
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,330
Speaker 1: But John Lasseter is going to be there, too.

459
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,170
Speaker 1: And basically this is remember how Satoshi Kon got that retrospective in New York City.

460
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:44,730
Speaker 1: And then he was like, well, I hope I get another one because I feel like I'm just getting started.

461
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:48,150
Speaker 1: This is pretty much that times a million for Miyazaki.

462
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:48,761
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

463
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,780
Speaker 1: But anyway, before we get to it, things of the day, how long has the episode been already?

464
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,480
Speaker 1: Not that long.

465
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,720
Speaker 1: OK, we've gone on longer.

466
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,140
Speaker 1: All right.

467
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,674
Speaker 1: About less.

468
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:10,039
Speaker 1: But chipmunks and Star Wars, I'm not exactly sure what the deal is, but is it like Alvin Simon Theodore?

469
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,604
Speaker 0: Does Darth Vader, Luke?

470
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:25,620
Speaker 1: and basically as far as I can tell, this guy had wild chipmunks living near him and he bribed them with almonds and then surrounded them with various Star Wars figures and took pictures of them and reacting to the Star Wars figures.

471
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:30,120
Speaker 0: I think I saw one of these because I saw a stormtrooper riding on a chip.

472
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,059
Speaker 1: That is, in fact, the first picture I'm looking at.

473
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:32,555
Speaker 0: Yes.

474
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,320
Speaker 0: All that picture.

475
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:33,532
Speaker 0: Yeah.

476
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,800
Speaker 1: The one in the end is pretty good.

477
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,659
Speaker 1: It's an Ewok taking a spear to the chipmunk and the chipmunks got his mouth open like, ah, no, it's a good one.

478
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:41,820
Speaker 1: There's only seven of them.

479
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,838
Speaker 1: This isn't that much of a deal, but I'm sick of using videos from College Humor as things of the day.

480
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:50,460
Speaker 1: So for once, a non College Humor video thing of the day.

481
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:51,459
Speaker 0: All right.

482
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,500
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is a webcomic that I discovered, but I haven't read it.

483
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,180
Speaker 0: So don't blame me if it's no good.

484
00:22:57,562 --> 00:23:00,520
Speaker 0: But I looked at it and it looks really good.

485
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,180
Speaker 1: I can pick things of the day if I don't even know what they are.

486
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,080
Speaker 0: That's right.

487
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:05,077
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

488
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:06,094
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

489
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:07,439
Speaker 0: Is the webcomic.

490
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,276
Speaker 0: It's called Marsh Rocket M.A.R.S.H.

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,439
Speaker 0: Like a bog or a swamp, a marsh, you know, a dank, spooky marsh and rocket like into outer space.

492
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,140
Speaker 0: Marsh Rocket.

493
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,279
Speaker 0: It's a webcomic.

494
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:21,018
Speaker 0: It looks cool.

495
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,177
Speaker 0: It looks sort of like a sci fi anime of awesome with some pretty interesting coloring going on.

496
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,200
Speaker 0: And I will read it and then I will know if it's actually written well or not.

497
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,674
Speaker 0: But in the meantime, you got none better to do.

498
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:35,338
Speaker 0: read webcomic.

499
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,480
Speaker 1: So usually we cover this right after we go.

500
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,640
Speaker 1: But you know, we're on the alternate alternating schedule now.

501
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:44,840
Speaker 1: But we were at the MOCA in New York City.

502
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,196
Speaker 0: Well, not at the MOCA at the MOCA Arts Festival, which is a once a year event.

503
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,300
Speaker 0: And for the MOCA, it is their primary fundraising event.

504
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:57,540
Speaker 0: And it is pretty much the best comic convention in New York City.

505
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:58,759
Speaker 0: Take that in your account.

506
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:00,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, it pretty much is a snap.

507
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,739
Speaker 0: So we've done shows about it in the past.

508
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:07,020
Speaker 0: You know, do you really want to spend a lot of time talking about what the MOCA was?

509
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:09,919
Speaker 1: I just want to get right into it because we got some good stuff.

510
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,200
Speaker 0: We did get some good stuff, you know, actually.

511
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:28,180
Speaker 0: So we went to the MOCA and the first thing I got there was like a print, actually, which is sort of out of usually I just get, you know, comics there and I don't really buy arts, but I forget who it was and they didn't give me their they didn't put their business card in with the poster.

512
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:29,235
Speaker 0: So that was sort of side.

513
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,058
Speaker 0: I remember them.

514
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,454
Speaker 0: Sorry.

515
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:33,440
Speaker 0: But it was like this awesome print where it was like it was all red.

516
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:37,880
Speaker 0: And then there was like this big pile of blue junk in the in the corner.

517
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,719
Speaker 0: And this person was sort of falling out of it.

518
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,680
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome.

519
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:45,199
Speaker 0: So maybe I'll try to find it and post a link in the forum.

520
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:45,840
Speaker 1: Don't forget.

521
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,800
Speaker 1: I can find out who did it.

522
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,439
Speaker 1: We also got the futurism print.

523
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:49,699
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

524
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,960
Speaker 0: That we be quickly soon after made a stop at the Wondermark table, which the Wondermark table is always wonderful.

525
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:57,399
Speaker 1: Every year I buy something.

526
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

527
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,120
Speaker 1: So this year did not disappoint.

528
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:00,376
Speaker 1: Yeah.

529
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:04,380
Speaker 0: I was disappointing, though, that the he's usually Sherry at the Puck building.

530
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,060
Speaker 0: I first of all was in a new building this year.

531
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,660
Speaker 0: It was in an armory as opposed to used to be at the Puck building.

532
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:09,995
Speaker 0: Right.

533
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,520
Speaker 0: But the armory was it was instead of being separate rooms, it was just one big room.

534
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:14,948
Speaker 0: So.

535
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:15,420
Speaker 0: All right.

536
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:24,340
Speaker 0: One big room has advantages and disadvantages, lost a little bit of charm, gained a little bit of efficiency, but it was really hot in the armory.

537
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,819
Speaker 0: Really hot.

538
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,600
Speaker 0: I mean, the Puck building was hot, but the armory was real hot.

539
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,060
Speaker 1: Well, what really got me was I remember standing there and I'm sweating and I'm feeling just just overwhelmed.

540
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:41,860
Speaker 1: And then I look up and I realized that in the sky there are eleven burning sons of death.

541
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:43,779
Speaker 0: And well, they would have turned it off.

542
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,598
Speaker 0: It would have been pitch black.

543
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,580
Speaker 1: But the thing is, maybe a third of those lights were actually on.

544
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:50,379
Speaker 1: I can't imagine.

545
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,220
Speaker 0: I remember I walked into the to the festival and I smelled some nasty B.O.

546
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,770
Speaker 0: and I was like, whoa, I didn't know this is.

547
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,100
Speaker 0: I thought this, you know, this isn't usually a fanboy convention.

548
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:01,540
Speaker 0: It's usually, you know, cool hip indie type people.

549
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,640
Speaker 0: And it is cool hip indie type people.

550
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:06,120
Speaker 0: But it was just so warm sooner within some minutes.

551
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,482
Speaker 0: I had the

552
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:06,844
Speaker 0: B.O.,

553
00:26:06,985 --> 00:26:09,699
Speaker 0: even though I had deodorant, it was just that hot in there.

554
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:10,879
Speaker 0: Everyone was.

555
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:14,319
Speaker 1: We also met up with two awesome listeners, friends, Phil and Timo.

556
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:15,404
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

557
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,018
Speaker 0: Timo, all the way from the Finland.

558
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,944
Speaker 0: Totally awesome.

559
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,980
Speaker 1: Who was also in Boston.

560
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,340
Speaker 0: He was in Boston because he's a physicist and he was doing some physics action.

561
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,019
Speaker 1: But he took some time away from the physics to take the Chinatown bus all the way to New York just to go to the MOCA.

562
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,000
Speaker 0: And he showed us some really good comics from the northern Europe.

563
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,339
Speaker 0: So totally sweet.

564
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll talk about those.

565
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,180
Speaker 1: I think we should just get right into all the individual things we got.

566
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:44,460
Speaker 0: So here the first thing I'll talk about is, oh, the Wondermark we were talking about at the Wondermark booth.

567
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,919
Speaker 0: We bought both of his posters.

568
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:47,860
Speaker 0: He was selling both of them for fifteen dollars.

569
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,328
Speaker 0: So it was fifteen dollars to get to.

570
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:51,099
Speaker 0: usually it's ten dollars each, I think.

571
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:55,880
Speaker 0: So we got the Futurism poster and also the Hierarchy of Beards poster.

572
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,340
Speaker 0: Highly recommended posters for your wall.

573
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,063
Speaker 0: Very stylish.

574
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:02,402
Speaker 1: I've been planning to buy that Hierarchy of Beards for a while and it was there.

575
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:02,905
Speaker 1: So I got it.

576
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:05,160
Speaker 0: And that Futurism one, it's like five bucks extra.

577
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,340
Speaker 0: And it's totally my style.

578
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:07,083
Speaker 0: All right.

579
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,760
Speaker 0: So here I got this is a book.

580
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,258
Speaker 0: I actually didn't buy at the MOCA.

581
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,060
Speaker 0: It is Ace Face, the mod with the metal arms by Mike Dawson.

582
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,380
Speaker 0: I haven't read it yet, so I can't tell you if it's good or bad.

583
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,560
Speaker 0: But Mike Dawson, if you remember, he did the Freddie and Me book, which is totally awesome in a million ways.

584
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,360
Speaker 1: Scott got something very special from him.

585
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:26,942
Speaker 0: Yes.

586
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:35,220
Speaker 0: You see, I had my pirate sketchbook, you see, which, you know, I always sort of you know, I think I'm just going to give this to everyone, get a million sketches in it.

587
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,063
Speaker 0: But, you know, I think it's better to just get a few at a time, one or two at each convention.

588
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:44,659
Speaker 0: And then over the years it will build up and build up, you know, rather than, you know, just doing hardcore on it.

589
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,360
Speaker 0: So the only, you know, pirate sketch I got at the convention was for Mike Dawson.

590
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:52,720
Speaker 0: And usually I just tell people, draw whatever you want.

591
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,680
Speaker 0: That's piratey, you know, anything that you want, but has to be piratey in some way.

592
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,022
Speaker 0: But instead, I told Mike Dawson to draw pirate Freddie Mercury and draw pirate Freddie Mercury.

593
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:03,425
Speaker 0: He did.

594
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,880
Speaker 0: And that's all there is to say about that.

595
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:06,800
Speaker 1: It was it was quite.

596
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:07,919
Speaker 0: And this is his new book.

597
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:13,481
Speaker 0: And I'm sure it is awesome because it is made by someone who draws pirate Freddie Mercury.

598
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:18,100
Speaker 1: So Lamar Abrams has put out a comic called Remake.

599
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:24,437
Speaker 0: Man, like I seen I saw the cover of this comic around you like I had seen it and I recognized it when I saw it.

600
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:28,980
Speaker 0: But then we actually got to the table and we saw Lamar Abrams and he was totally cool.

601
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:32,320
Speaker 0: Like he was an awesome dude and actually flipped through his comic.

602
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,879
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, wow, this is this is more than what I thought it was going to be.

603
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:39,319
Speaker 1: And I read it and I liked it, too.

604
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,480
Speaker 0: It's it's sort of Astro Boy.

605
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,019
Speaker 0: Well, it's sort of Mega Man, but really what it is, I think it's Astro Boy the jerk.

606
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:52,180
Speaker 1: Well, there's also there's a little bit of Scott Pilgrim, just a little in the dialog, I think it's a dialog.

607
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,138
Speaker 1: And also in the way characters will kind of look almost make the Internet face to look up and away and smile a little bit.

608
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you're right.

609
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:09,723
Speaker 1: But there's also a tiny bit of Tekkon King Crete almost just in the way the characters present themselves and the sudden jumps to extreme and needless violence.

610
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:14,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no, I really think that the summary of this book I would give to someone it's Astro Boy the jerk.

611
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:19,980
Speaker 0: You know, he's totally Astro Boy, but he's not nice and he's not evil.

612
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,953
Speaker 0: He's not a bad guy.

613
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:21,400
Speaker 0: Right.

614
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:22,900
Speaker 0: But he's just an asshole.

615
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,380
Speaker 0: The people just like he'll just like break shit or like, you know, go to sleep.

616
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,740
Speaker 0: But he's supposed to be doing something.

617
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,512
Speaker 0: And so it's it was.

618
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:32,460
Speaker 0: it was really funny.

619
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:34,539
Speaker 0: I like this book a lot.

620
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:39,067
Speaker 1: I haven't read it all yet, but the two best parts so far is I like the girl with the drill hands.

621
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:39,618
Speaker 1: Yeah.

622
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:41,879
Speaker 1: And I like the cat.

623
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:43,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cat's good.

624
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,380
Speaker 1: I really like the cat.

625
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,306
Speaker 0: The girl with the drill hands.

626
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's one of my favorite parts, too.

627
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:48,389
Speaker 1: We need more of her.

628
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:49,400
Speaker 1: She needs her own comic.

629
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,023
Speaker 0: Yeah.

630
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,339
Speaker 0: Oh, just drill hands, girl.

631
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:51,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

632
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:57,900
Speaker 0: And, you know, at the end is some Pluto inspired action towards the end there.

633
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,407
Speaker 1: Well, it's funny because I interviewed him a little bit and he basically said, yeah, this is inspired by.

634
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:03,919
Speaker 1: and then the list of things that we said.

635
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:04,423
Speaker 0: Yeah.

636
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,540
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Lamar Abrams, totally cool.

637
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,540
Speaker 0: I'm you know what I want to see.

638
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,407
Speaker 0: I'm really looking for.

639
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:10,920
Speaker 0: it's like he's got to do something else.

640
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,224
Speaker 0: Right.

641
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,320
Speaker 0: Or maybe he has something else.

642
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,940
Speaker 0: I got to go look at his website, you know, has quite a bit because if he made this, he made some other awesome stuff or is going to make some other awesome stuff that I want.

643
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:21,098
Speaker 0: Probably even more.

644
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,219
Speaker 0: You know, so Lamar Abrams for the win.

645
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:23,807
Speaker 1: All right.

646
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:24,499
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

647
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:25,222
Speaker 0: All right.

648
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:29,400
Speaker 0: So at the drawing and quarterly table.

649
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,781
Speaker 0: Right.

650
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:31,487
Speaker 0: First of all, they had some.

651
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,162
Speaker 0: they had some very nice deals on some Yoji Hero Tatsumi.

652
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:41,022
Speaker 0: It was like by drifting life and get one of the other Tatsumi books cheap or free.

653
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:44,902
Speaker 0: It was there were some good deals going on, but I already had all them Tatsumi books.

654
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:47,779
Speaker 0: So I just had another deal going on.

655
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,500
Speaker 0: They had Adrian Tomine's 32 stories, the complete optic nerve mini comics.

656
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:57,200
Speaker 0: And if you bought that, you would also get another Adrian Tomine book.

657
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,180
Speaker 0: So I got shortcomings.

658
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:58,784
Speaker 0: Right.

659
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:01,240
Speaker 0: So basically I got both of these was a combo.

660
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,635
Speaker 0: I saved like 10 bucks.

661
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:03,040
Speaker 0: Right.

662
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,262
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I haven't read either of these yet, so I'm not going to say much about them.

663
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:08,995
Speaker 0: But Adrian Tomine is 32 stories.

664
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:10,225
Speaker 0: Right.

665
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:11,899
Speaker 0: It's a little cardboard box.

666
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:22,240
Speaker 0: It's like a brown cardboard and you slip the box open and inside is a cardboard box that actually contains like all eight mini comics, all separate.

667
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:24,100
Speaker 0: It was a box full of mini comics.

668
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,623
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a trade paperback that had all the same pages as the mini comics reprinted.

669
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:32,639
Speaker 0: No, it's actually the eight mini comics in a box.

670
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,820
Speaker 0: And I just I thought that was really cool.

671
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:35,425
Speaker 0: It's it's.

672
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:36,820
Speaker 0: it's a very nice production.

673
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,099
Speaker 0: And that was that alone was totally worth it.

674
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,140
Speaker 0: And of course, you know, this is much hyped and much critically acclaimed.

675
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:46,740
Speaker 0: And I know that Tomine is an appreciator of Tatsumi.

676
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:52,000
Speaker 0: So he knows good comics and he's, you know, comic creator himself is has to be good.

677
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,050
Speaker 0: It's a guaranteed lock.

678
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:53,938
Speaker 0: That's why I bought it.

679
00:31:54,561 --> 00:32:00,900
Speaker 1: Pretty much the first thing I saw, though, when I walked in and I had to buy it and I think I'm going to have to buy the rest of these forever.

680
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,300
Speaker 1: Tim Raglin made this series of gigantic children's picture books.

681
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:16,160
Speaker 1: Well, now they're in the style at least of a children's picture book, Scott and West, A Complete Story Adventure, Volume One, The Curse of Cat Uncommon.

682
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:28,580
Speaker 1: It's basically a Scotty dog and another dog and cats, and it's just anthropomorphize dogs and cats on old Sherlock Holmes style action adventure.

683
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:30,246
Speaker 1: It's hard.

684
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:30,970
Speaker 1: I can't do.

685
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,540
Speaker 0: what was that other book he had there?

686
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,640
Speaker 0: It was like Uncle So-and-so Christmas.

687
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:35,664
Speaker 1: Yes.

688
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:35,969
Speaker 1: Yes.

689
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,600
Speaker 1: He had several.

690
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,479
Speaker 1: I only bought one, but I plan to buy the rest.

691
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,123
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:44,538
Speaker 1: I hope the only reason I only bought one was that I didn't want to carry these gigantic books around the entire mocha.

693
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the back will give you an idea.

694
00:32:47,880 --> 00:33:05,269
Speaker 1: Presenting The Curse of Cat Uncommon, being the legacy of an ancient cat, most uncommon international adventure mystery and a seasoning of intrigue for little misses and masters extensively embellished with colored engravings, sure to delight and improve children of every age.

695
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,660
Speaker 1: These books are beauties to behold.

696
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,180
Speaker 1: And to get a sense of how big this is, it is the size and shape of Scott's monitor.

697
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:15,360
Speaker 1: It is the same aspect ratio.

698
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,940
Speaker 0: In fact, it's a. it's a pretty big book.

699
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:24,900
Speaker 1: I got to tell you, this is the kind of thing that I would give to a child or put in my library on the top of my shelves with a little like tripod.

700
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:27,277
Speaker 1: It's a display book.

701
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:28,425
Speaker 0: Yeah.

702
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:30,000
Speaker 0: So you should definitely better look out for these.

703
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:43,480
Speaker 0: I noticed recently this sort of been, you know, a greater interest in like sort of like these high end children's picture books that are sort of comic sort of, you know, it's like there's a line between what's an illustrated book and what's a comic.

704
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:43,900
Speaker 0: Right.

705
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:50,164
Speaker 0: And, you know, there's a lot of stuff like The Arrival, you know, by by Chantin.

706
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:50,485
Speaker 0: Right.

707
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:55,385
Speaker 0: You know, stuff like that is sort of really sort of making a push into the comic scene.

708
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:59,304
Speaker 0: And, you know, it's not just sort of staying in the children's illustrated book scene.

709
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:05,759
Speaker 0: And this I noticed the illustrations in these type of things are just absolutely stunning.

710
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:10,502
Speaker 0: And who cares if it's not technically a comic, it's not paneled, it's not sequential art.

711
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:11,246
Speaker 0: Who gives a fuck?

712
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,120
Speaker 0: It's this amazing illustration.

713
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,804
Speaker 0: I'll buy it.

714
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,139
Speaker 0: I'll buy a print of one picture.

715
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,958
Speaker 0: I'll buy a book full of awesome pictures on every page.

716
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,476
Speaker 1: Plus, he gave me, along with the book, a giant sticker of Dr.

717
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:23,898
Speaker 1: Mu Manchu.

718
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:28,320
Speaker 1: It's just these are so wonderful.

719
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,396
Speaker 0: We could turn we should turn Dr.

720
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,179
Speaker 0: Mu Manchu into an Internet meme.

721
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:32,447
Speaker 1: I'm sure we could.

722
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,920
Speaker 0: I mean, he's already ready.

723
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,560
Speaker 0: He's it's already primed to pull the trigger.

724
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:46,239
Speaker 0: All right, so I sort of have a problem when I go to the mocha, right, is sort of I tell myself, first of all, I tell myself spend like crazy, right, because you're not going to see this stuff for anywhere else.

725
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,967
Speaker 0: Just go nuts.

726
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:47,978
Speaker 0: Don't hold back.

727
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:50,257
Speaker 0: If you have a slight feeling about something, just buy it.

728
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:50,721
Speaker 0: Right.

729
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:54,600
Speaker 0: Of course, this one thing that holds me back is that rim buys stuff.

730
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,449
Speaker 0: He's going to buy it.

731
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,199
Speaker 0: I'm not going to buy it.

732
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,601
Speaker 0: Right.

733
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:08,260
Speaker 0: Another thing that holds me back is sort of, you know, I'm always sort of like, OK, I'll see something that might be, you know, I'll judge it by its cover, but I won't have a lot of confidence that it's actually good.

734
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:08,821
Speaker 0: Right.

735
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:14,079
Speaker 0: It's like I'll say I'll see something really cute, but I don't actually have a lot of confidence that it's actually any good.

736
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,206
Speaker 0: It's just really cute, you know, so I sort of feel like I want to buy it for the cuteness, but that I don't want to buy it.

737
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:21,860
Speaker 0: So I sort of limit myself on cute things.

738
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,500
Speaker 0: I'll be like only buy one or two things in the cute category.

739
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:30,423
Speaker 0: So I bought one thing in the cute category, which is Cooking with Food Volume one by Evan Palmer.

740
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:34,040
Speaker 0: And so I see this book sitting there and on the cover.

741
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:35,704
Speaker 0: It's a mini comic.

742
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:40,404
Speaker 0: There's all these different foods, an apple, potato, an onion, some pepper.

743
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:42,060
Speaker 1: That tomato wasn't looking so good.

744
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,620
Speaker 0: The tomato doesn't think he has some problems biting his tongue.

745
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,303
Speaker 0: He's not happy.

746
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:49,240
Speaker 0: You know, a lemon, an avocado, a pickle, garlic.

747
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,018
Speaker 0: And there's a knife and a spatula, but they're not anthropomorphized in any way.

748
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:54,520
Speaker 0: or vegeta more legume.

749
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:57,340
Speaker 1: Well, they're definitely anthropomorphized.

750
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,726
Speaker 1: They talk and walk around.

751
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:03,638
Speaker 1: the vegetables are, but the spatula and the avocado is said that those two mooks don't know anything about.

752
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:10,719
Speaker 0: So I bought this because it was so ridiculously cute with the with the vegetables, with different cool faces and expressions on them.

753
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:13,151
Speaker 0: I got home and I actually read that.

754
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,640
Speaker 0: I actually read this on the train home.

755
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:31,700
Speaker 0: It was actually like so awesome, like a hundred times awesome and not just in its cuteness, but in the fact that, A, you're getting real recipes and B, it's actually well written and like the vegetables are all great characters.

756
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:32,648
Speaker 0: And it's it's.

757
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:33,779
Speaker 0: it's totally sweet.

758
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:40,991
Speaker 0: And I'm like I'm just like waiting to go to mocha next year, hoping I can get volume two and get more cooking with.

759
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,440
Speaker 0: it's called cooking with food.

760
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:46,600
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like just to give you an example.

761
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:46,944
Speaker 0: Right.

762
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:48,479
Speaker 0: The first page, he's sitting there.

763
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:50,200
Speaker 0: He's about to cut this potato.

764
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,398
Speaker 0: Suddenly the potato has eyeballs.

765
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,260
Speaker 1: Then the potatoes have eyeballs to begin with.

766
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,461
Speaker 0: Right.

767
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,276
Speaker 0: Then the potato says, hey, Evan.

768
00:36:58,465 --> 00:36:59,780
Speaker 0: So he stops cutting the potato.

769
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,459
Speaker 0: He's like, yes, potato.

770
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,918
Speaker 0: And it goes from there.

771
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:10,700
Speaker 0: So cooking with food by Evan Palmer is one hundred times the win.

772
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,759
Speaker 1: I think he had a bunch of other little things.

773
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,800
Speaker 0: So Evan Palmer comics dot com.

774
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,325
Speaker 0: There he goes.

775
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,440
Speaker 0: It's on the back of this book.

776
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,000
Speaker 0: So I am looking forward to more cooking with food and more Evan Palmer.

777
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,992
Speaker 1: Speaking of little things, I should.

778
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:24,200
Speaker 0: that teaches me a lesson.

779
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,679
Speaker 0: Don't hold back just because it's cute.

780
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:29,480
Speaker 1: I did pick up number two of the Diary of Diaries.

781
00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:30,860
Speaker 0: Diary of Diaries.

782
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,971
Speaker 1: I very much enjoyed them on the same level that I enjoyed that other comic that I couldn't find anymore.

783
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:36,860
Speaker 1: The prison stories.

784
00:37:37,782 --> 00:37:38,467
Speaker 0: That was a good one.

785
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:38,648
Speaker 0: Yeah.

786
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,312
Speaker 1: You know what?

787
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:40,460
Speaker 1: I like more than killing.

788
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:40,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's weird.

789
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:46,780
Speaker 0: It's like this autobiographical comics, you know, but then there is sort of these that they're comics that are like true tales.

790
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:51,262
Speaker 0: You know, it's like it'll just be sort of a bunch of true stories that are all really short.

791
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:55,304
Speaker 0: You know, the kind of story you'll tell someone like, hey, one time, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

792
00:37:55,586 --> 00:38:04,580
Speaker 0: So someone draws up that short little story and like a few pages of comic and you do about 10 of those and you slap them together in a book and you got yourself, you know, a nice comic.

793
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,960
Speaker 0: That's and I really like that genre, whatever genre that is.

794
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:11,440
Speaker 0: And I see quite a few of them at MOCA every year.

795
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:12,697
Speaker 0: They catch my eye.

796
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:20,018
Speaker 1: But, you know, in particular, it is always easy to draw me into something with bums, prison or poop.

797
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:24,419
Speaker 1: The more of those are in the same comic, the better.

798
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,663
Speaker 0: That's Rims.

799
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:30,280
Speaker 0: If you want to sell comics to Rims, make them about bums who get into prison and then have poop fight.

800
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,800
Speaker 1: But the thing is, it can't just be normal bums.

801
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,038
Speaker 1: It has to be dapper bums.

802
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

803
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,979
Speaker 1: They have the more dapper, the better.

804
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:37,109
Speaker 1: A dapper poop.

805
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:38,000
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do.

806
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,399
Speaker 0: They're not a stab and hobo.

807
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,458
Speaker 0: They're a poop and hobo.

808
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,159
Speaker 1: Poop jokes and top hats.

809
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,420
Speaker 0: That was that was the Wondermark.

810
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,618
Speaker 1: That's why I read Wondermark.

811
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

812
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:48,800
Speaker 1: I thought the comic was called that for a long time until I finally looked at it.

813
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,281
Speaker 1: I know.

814
00:38:49,321 --> 00:38:49,823
Speaker 1: Right.

815
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:57,220
Speaker 1: But the Diary of Diaries is always fun because they're basically true stories from this guy who has had many misadventures in pooping.

816
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,600
Speaker 0: I mean, I have sometimes Bali problems.

817
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,497
Speaker 0: This guy, he's got real Bali problems, but he basically told me that it is.

818
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:09,700
Speaker 1: it is surprisingly cathartic to just not try to hide it and just to tell these stories.

819
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:16,958
Speaker 1: And even though he went through everything in these stories, the fact that someone else can get a laugh off it makes him feel a lot better about it.

820
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:20,900
Speaker 1: But issue number two is all close calls.

821
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:28,339
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, because I mean, you know, even if you have bowel problems that are pretty serious, you're not going to be shit in your pants that much.

822
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:28,901
Speaker 0: You're right.

823
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:41,960
Speaker 0: Well, so, you know, you'd only so many stories you've got of that are true, you know, so he sort of I think, you know, he's used a lot of stories in volume one, like four or five stories of poop in volume one.

824
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,240
Speaker 0: So, of course, volume two had to be the close call stories.

825
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,420
Speaker 0: But that does not diminish the quality of these stories in any way.

826
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:56,206
Speaker 0: In fact, some of these stories are even more epic than the volume one, because, you know, it's got that whole.

827
00:39:56,266 --> 00:40:00,103
Speaker 0: holding it in action is really the power in the diary of diaries.

828
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:01,854
Speaker 0: is the suspense of.

829
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:02,639
Speaker 0: is he going to make it?

830
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,690
Speaker 0: How's he going to make it?

831
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,498
Speaker 0: What's he going to do?

832
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:06,299
Speaker 0: Is he going to actually find in a bathroom?

833
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,899
Speaker 0: Is he going to poop in the woods?

834
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,860
Speaker 1: You know, I just realized I got to email him and point out, don't shit your pants.

835
00:40:12,502 --> 00:40:14,220
Speaker 1: Oh, man, I'm sure you love it.

836
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:14,990
Speaker 1: He's a cool guy.

837
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:15,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

838
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,907
Speaker 0: That'd be awesome.

839
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,382
Speaker 1: I point him out because I don't want to talk about all the things like this.

840
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:26,580
Speaker 1: But this is an example of the kind of, you know, anyone can publish an indie comic and anyone can present at the MOCA.

841
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,667
Speaker 0: This guy's not the best.

842
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,260
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't someone draw it for him?

843
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,860
Speaker 1: These are eight and a half by eleven pieces of paper with black and white, basically Xerox stapled together with a color paper wrapper.

844
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:36,485
Speaker 0: That's it.

845
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:38,080
Speaker 0: And hold it in half with a staple.

846
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,172
Speaker 1: And yet here they are.

847
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:39,759
Speaker 1: And you know what?

848
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:40,707
Speaker 1: I enjoy them.

849
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:41,879
Speaker 0: I enjoy them very much.

850
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:45,744
Speaker 0: And if it wasn't for the MOCA, I'd probably never get them or see them or know about them or anything.

851
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,640
Speaker 1: So I also have in front of me another small one.

852
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:49,727
Speaker 1: And I did pick this up.

853
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,719
Speaker 1: And Scott also picked it up the next day.

854
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,138
Speaker 0: I have to let me let me let me cover this cover.

855
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,118
Speaker 1: Paul, sorry.

856
00:40:55,481 --> 00:41:00,461
Speaker 0: So Rim was standing at this table talking to someone else about the Gilgamesh table, right?

857
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:00,704
Speaker 1: Yeah.

858
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:00,988
Speaker 1: Yeah.

859
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:01,879
Speaker 1: I was interviewing that.

860
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:10,946
Speaker 0: So he's standing there talking to this person and I'm just sort of hanging out, you know, looking around and on the table in front of me, I see this book, Don't Trust Evil Knievel.

861
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:11,715
Speaker 0: And I'm like, OK.

862
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:18,869
Speaker 0: And on the cover, there's a sort of a sketchy drawing of a character, a cartoon character of Evil Knievel.

863
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:20,380
Speaker 0: You sort of only see his helmet.

864
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,780
Speaker 0: It's sort of like he looks like the Stig with stars all over him, basically.

865
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:27,839
Speaker 0: And it says on the cover, Evil Knievel is saying, buy this book.

866
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:33,180
Speaker 0: And then every page of this book is pretty much the right hand side of the page.

867
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:33,704
Speaker 0: Right.

868
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:35,660
Speaker 0: Says, don't trust Evil Knievel in some font.

869
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:38,920
Speaker 0: And on the left side, there's a picture of Evil Knievel.

870
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,340
Speaker 0: And he has one speech bubble.

871
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,777
Speaker 1: So let me read to you some of these that they're all bet it all.

872
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:49,520
Speaker 0: And it's safe to pet a lion as much as you want after it's eaten the gazelle.

873
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:51,599
Speaker 1: They want you to be up on stage.

874
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,920
Speaker 0: You can jump that far easy.

875
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,360
Speaker 1: I'm sure that's how it's spelled.

876
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,678
Speaker 0: Whatever's in that giant mouse hole can't be that big.

877
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,399
Speaker 1: The roller coaster is supposed to do that.

878
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,099
Speaker 0: Lightning can only strike you once.

879
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,838
Speaker 1: I never miss that.

880
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,028
Speaker 0: They they just go.

881
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:08,419
Speaker 0: roller coaster is supposed to do that.

882
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:09,304
Speaker 1: I said that one.

883
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:11,879
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't need your shoes for this.

884
00:42:12,582 --> 00:42:14,020
Speaker 0: This is you should have one more.

885
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,260
Speaker 1: There is definitely a genre, a kind of comic where it's almost the concept comic.

886
00:42:19,382 --> 00:42:20,460
Speaker 1: And there were a lot of these.

887
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,179
Speaker 1: We picked up another one, the wolf cried boy.

888
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:23,979
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that in a little bit.

889
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:29,600
Speaker 1: But it was pretty much just a concept, but it was amusing enough to where I picked it up.

890
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,440
Speaker 1: Is the kind of thing that you read once it's amusing and then you give it to someone.

891
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:33,286
Speaker 0: Yep.

892
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:34,120
Speaker 0: Yeah.

893
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,840
Speaker 0: But, you know, this is the kind of thing where it's like, you don't sit down and read this book.

894
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:40,100
Speaker 0: You know, you just leave it lying somewhere, maybe the bathroom.

895
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:51,420
Speaker 0: And, you know, if you just need something to read, like during the two minutes while you're eating your cereal or whatever in the morning, you know, you could just open it up, pick any random page and maybe you'll get a laugh.

896
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:53,794
Speaker 0: You know, it's sort of, you know, and it's it's.

897
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:54,620
Speaker 0: it's pretty funny.

898
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:02,680
Speaker 0: And I mean, you know, at first I looked at it when I was standing at the table and I was kind of like, eh, you know, but then I open it and started reading it and I was actually laughing.

899
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:03,791
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh, my gosh.

900
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:04,660
Speaker 0: So I'm like, all right.

901
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,490
Speaker 0: I laughed at your book.

902
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:06,179
Speaker 0: Here's my money.

903
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:10,820
Speaker 1: I think part of what made it funny is that individually nothing in here was that funny.

904
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:19,260
Speaker 1: But the repetition, like it's one of those things where people try to do something clever with the form of a media or work as opposed to the content.

905
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:21,240
Speaker 1: And usually it falls flat on its face.

906
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:29,520
Speaker 1: But here just the don't trust Evil Knievel in a different font on every single splash page made it funnier because it's kind of like it.

907
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:38,840
Speaker 0: It's almost like a like a Photoshop thread, like, you know, it's like there's a common there's a common theme, but each, you know, and everyone sort of gives their own spin.

908
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,760
Speaker 0: So each of these pages has a different line of dialogue.

909
00:43:41,861 --> 00:43:45,200
Speaker 0: It's almost like one of those caption contests, you know, it's like caption this image.

910
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:47,260
Speaker 0: Well, you know, that's what this book is.

911
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:49,379
Speaker 0: It's a caption contest one guy had with himself.

912
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:51,204
Speaker 1: I rather enjoyed it.

913
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:56,600
Speaker 1: But while Scott was picking this up and then I was picking it up later, I was talking to Kent and Kevin Dixon.

914
00:43:56,982 --> 00:43:59,980
Speaker 1: And, you know, I walk up and I see this comic and it looks interesting.

915
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,785
Speaker 1: It's Gilgamesh.

916
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,317
Speaker 1: Gilgamesh!

917
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,879
Speaker 0: Misused in many anime.

918
00:44:06,382 --> 00:44:08,339
Speaker 1: Also, apparently it's a 4chan thing now.

919
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:09,060
Speaker 0: Really?

920
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,620
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what the deal is, but someone made a joke on Fark and then someone else explained that it was a 4chan thing.

921
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,460
Speaker 1: But apparently people just post a picture of someone and type Gilgamesh underneath it.

922
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,017
Speaker 1: And I don't I don't know what it's referring to.

923
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:30,200
Speaker 1: But what this is and, you know, I was interested and I start talking to the guy and I put the microphone in his face like, hey, you want to give me a few words?

924
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,740
Speaker 1: He's like, you should wait until the artist comes back.

925
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,384
Speaker 1: I'm like, OK.

926
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:35,980
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, yeah, the artist is my son.

927
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:37,179
Speaker 1: And I start talking to him.

928
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,100
Speaker 1: Then his son comes back.

929
00:44:38,201 --> 00:44:38,980
Speaker 1: I did a short interview.

930
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:48,280
Speaker 1: But basically the father would read mythological tales, you know, Greek mythology and Gilgamesh and things like that to his son when they were young.

931
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:51,299
Speaker 0: And three messenger fans.

932
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,680
Speaker 0: Getting

933
00:44:51,800 --> 00:45:10,000
Speaker 1: older to get his son to do something, he decided to make his own rendition, you know, which is basically you take a rendition is when you take multiple different translations of a work and synthesize them along with some of your own original translation work into a new kind of interpretation of the work.

934
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:21,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, because, you know, a lot of these old stories are either a oral tradition, so there is no official version, right, or be they're originally written in some language of old, you know, Greek or even older than that.

935
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,205
Speaker 0: So there's not.

936
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:30,260
Speaker 0: it's very difficult to know the exact story or even if there is such a thing as the exact correct story.

937
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:39,080
Speaker 0: So there's just sort of like these common, you know, things you know, it's like, OK, if it's going to be a you know, this story, then it has these characters.

938
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:44,360
Speaker 0: And this is the basic story and then fill in the details around it however you want.

939
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:46,080
Speaker 1: But it's not just that.

940
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:53,800
Speaker 1: I mean, even if you have one original work that is translated multiple times, if it's especially older languages, you can translate things in different ways.

941
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,219
Speaker 1: And there are different interpretations of what was actually being written.

942
00:45:57,002 --> 00:45:59,980
Speaker 1: So the father put that together and the son illustrated it.

943
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,199
Speaker 1: And it is a very direct retelling of the epic of Gilgamesh in comic form.

944
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:08,300
Speaker 1: And the story there alone was interesting.

945
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:13,378
Speaker 1: And when he signed it, he actually wrote something in Cuneiform, which I think it's Cuneiform.

946
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,620
Speaker 1: I have heard it pronounced both ways by people who had enough clout for me to trust them.

947
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:19,455
Speaker 1: So I don't know.

948
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:20,419
Speaker 0: We defer.

949
00:46:21,122 --> 00:46:22,160
Speaker 1: I defer to the Internet.

950
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,319
Speaker 0: I'm actually interested to read this because I don't know very much about, you know, the story of Gilgamesh.

951
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:29,340
Speaker 0: And it is referenced quite often.

952
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:35,640
Speaker 0: So I feel, you know, I'm never going to be able to read like, you know, the full, big on hardcore mythology in my life.

953
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,700
Speaker 0: But I'll probably be able to read this comic very quickly.

954
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:42,660
Speaker 1: The comic is also it's told in a very direct and literal form.

955
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,080
Speaker 0: Yeah.

956
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:50,860
Speaker 0: So now when there's all sorts of Gilgamesh references and novels and anime and who knows what, I will totally get them instead of being illiterate.

957
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:57,580
Speaker 1: I note that a character someone posted for the Burning Wheel game we're playing this weekend, Enkidu, you should learn who that is.

958
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,260
Speaker 0: I've heard of Enkidu before.

959
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,079
Speaker 1: Well, all will be made clear when you read this.

960
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:02,575
Speaker 0: All right.

961
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,848
Speaker 1: And I got to put up the interview at some point because these two, this father son duo was.

962
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:13,120
Speaker 1: it was there was something cool to be there at a table and to meet a father and son who collaborated on this like comic.

963
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:15,620
Speaker 1: They're not comic artists or anything special.

964
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,460
Speaker 1: They just got together, did it, got it printed, set up at the MOCA.

965
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,679
Speaker 1: And there they were with their with their epic.

966
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:22,139
Speaker 0: Yep.

967
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:24,540
Speaker 0: You know, we did a bunch of interviews in the MOCA.

968
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,520
Speaker 0: Most of them were very short, you know, sort of like, you know, hey, who are you?

969
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,100
Speaker 0: Tell us about your comic kind of things.

970
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,660
Speaker 0: But, you know, last year we sprinkled those throughout the episode itself.

971
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:42,940
Speaker 0: I think we should do is we should take them all, just string them together into like one audio file and put it up as like an extra, maybe in the experimental feed or the something like that.

972
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,280
Speaker 0: I don't know.

973
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,259
Speaker 1: It'll be up at some point.

974
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,160
Speaker 1: I just I didn't want to extend this episode any longer.

975
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:50,060
Speaker 0: And we didn't want to spend a lot of time editing tonight.

976
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:50,579
Speaker 0: Yeah.

977
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:52,480
Speaker 1: And normally I do this stuff like on the train.

978
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,579
Speaker 1: But anyway, I didn't get to it.

979
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,619
Speaker 1: And some of these people are really cool stuff to say.

980
00:47:55,827 --> 00:47:56,018
Speaker 0: Yep.

981
00:47:56,642 --> 00:48:00,720
Speaker 0: So the next book I have here is Top of the Heap by Keith McCleary.

982
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,160
Speaker 0: You might remember Keith McCleary from last year because he did.

983
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:06,638
Speaker 0: Oh, what's the name of the book?

984
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:08,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did Killing Tree Quarterly.

985
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:15,480
Speaker 0: See, I had the cover was in my mind, but the name of the book just wasn't coming because we talked about that last year.

986
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:19,260
Speaker 1: And he like he found our episode later and emailed us and he's pretty cool.

987
00:48:19,402 --> 00:48:20,800
Speaker 1: And I liked Killing Tree Quarterly.

988
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:27,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, Killing Tree Quarterly is pretty good because it was sort of like, you know, the the the mixed racial western sort of story.

989
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,358
Speaker 0: It was totally cool.

990
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:28,696
Speaker 1: Yeah.

991
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,740
Speaker 1: Plus he he is definitely improving as time goes on.

992
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

993
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:32,717
Speaker 0: So yeah.

994
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,800
Speaker 0: So Top of the Heap is new because we saw Killing Tree Quarterly and like, hey, we know this table.

995
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,978
Speaker 0: Let's see if there anything new.

996
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:41,920
Speaker 0: And sure enough, there was Top of the Heap, an animal story by Keith McCleary.

997
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,719
Speaker 0: Now, the first thing I noticed when I look at this.

998
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:49,740
Speaker 0: Well, of course, I know this is an animal story, but this book is like really amazing looking.

999
00:48:49,860 --> 00:49:00,940
Speaker 0: Like every page is like like a full color, shiny printed painted image from like the all covering every single, you know, spot on the paper from edge to edge.

1000
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,339
Speaker 0: There isn't really, you know, panels going on.

1001
00:49:04,102 --> 00:49:07,980
Speaker 0: And the images are just stunning, like absolutely stunning.

1002
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,220
Speaker 1: I believe originally when he did Killing Tree, he used, I think, Poser or something like it with 3D models to kind of set the scenes.

1003
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:16,918
Speaker 1: And then he made it from there.

1004
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:17,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1005
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,840
Speaker 0: So this is it's really amazing.

1006
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:27,220
Speaker 0: It looks like, you know, every page is like a full on painting, you know, and it's a story that involves a circus and some animals.

1007
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:28,518
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to spoil it for you.

1008
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:36,100
Speaker 0: And apparently he also told us that there is a there is a crossover in a way between this and Killing Tree Quarterly, if you have read them both.

1009
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,267
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1010
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,619
Speaker 1: He said it's something clever.

1011
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:38,659
Speaker 0: Yes.

1012
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,520
Speaker 0: So Top of the Heap is totally awesome.

1013
00:49:42,964 --> 00:49:44,000
Speaker 0: And how could you not?

1014
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,440
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just, you know, it's a nice little comic book with like this, you know, incredible artwork on every single page.

1015
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:52,959
Speaker 0: I'm just going to see you looking at it.

1016
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, you keep you keep doing so.

1017
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,480
Speaker 1: Speaking of something little Leslie and Mackenzie Stein, that's either one person or two people.

1018
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:00,440
Speaker 1: I think it's two people.

1019
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:10,820
Speaker 1: But these are the basically we found this table and that this gigantic spread of laminated pages with cutouts of paper in it and base South Park style.

1020
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:11,217
Speaker 0: Yes.

1021
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:14,520
Speaker 1: And South Park style is how they make these comics.

1022
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:18,320
Speaker 1: And it was a pretty cool concept of how they put it together.

1023
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,300
Speaker 1: And I picked up one of their works.

1024
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,880
Speaker 1: I think it was the first or one of the earlier ones that they had on the table.

1025
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

1026
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:41,260
Speaker 1: And while I don't it's clearly this comic is some sort of not necessarily an inside joke, but definitely an inside story like it is a story from their lives or from someone's life that is completely in media res with no context whatsoever.

1027
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:46,240
Speaker 1: So it doesn't really give you any resolution necessarily or any context.

1028
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,620
Speaker 1: But I don't know.

1029
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:48,940
Speaker 1: I was a neat little comic.

1030
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,340
Speaker 1: I just I really like the style.

1031
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,760
Speaker 1: I obviously don't want to talk about what it's about because I'll spoil it.

1032
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,437
Speaker 1: It's so short.

1033
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:00,360
Speaker 1: But the series of drawings done by Jim Morrison after she wakes up from her drunken band.

1034
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,780
Speaker 0: That was the best part is when she wakes up from being drunk and the dude just tells her what happened while she was drunk.

1035
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:07,820
Speaker 1: That was like that right there.

1036
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:11,060
Speaker 1: And also just her being drunk and just the style.

1037
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:18,420
Speaker 1: And I don't know, this wasn't necessarily a great work in and of itself, but I feel like good things are going to come out of these people.

1038
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,919
Speaker 0: But she had that whole new book was sitting, right?

1039
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Speaker 0: She talked about how, like with this one, they said, yeah, it is.

1040
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,997
Speaker 0: They scanned it in.

1041
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:31,860
Speaker 0: But that with the next book, the one that was sitting on the table, like she had the actual see the one we the copy of.

1042
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is that we have is just, you know, the scanned in and then printed out book, right?

1043
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:44,500
Speaker 0: But the new book, she actually had all the pages with the actual, you know, she used the scissors and cut out the paper and pasted it together.

1044
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:47,240
Speaker 0: You know, she had the actual thing there on the table.

1045
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:49,840
Speaker 0: And that looked like something really amazing.

1046
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,320
Speaker 0: And I can't wait to get that.

1047
00:51:51,360 --> 00:52:00,080
Speaker 0: But she says she's going to for that one, she's going to actually take photographs of all the pages instead of scanning, you know, to sort of get like some shadows going on and all that sort of good stuff.

1048
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,179
Speaker 0: So I can't wait for that book, whatever it's called anymore.

1049
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:05,919
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, I have two more.

1050
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,799
Speaker 0: You have a lot to I get like seven because you get you spent all the money and I didn't.

1051
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:18,560
Speaker 0: So this is a book that I actually knew about before I went to the mocha and I had planned to buy it a few times and I planned to buy it.

1052
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,539
Speaker 0: But then I saw it there.

1053
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,199
Speaker 0: And, you know, you see something at the mocha that you thought of buying before you're going to buy it.

1054
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:27,360
Speaker 0: It's called The Bizarre Comics of Booty Rogers.

1055
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:27,587
Speaker 0: Right.

1056
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,559
Speaker 1: And I read some of that on the train home.

1057
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:37,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically this dude was this awesome dude way back in the day who just his name was Booty Rogers.

1058
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:39,019
Speaker 0: That was his real name.

1059
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:47,120
Speaker 0: And, you know, he wrote, you know, those comics that he wrote were in the first ever comic book.

1060
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:47,610
Speaker 0: Right.

1061
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:52,540
Speaker 0: That's how old school and awesome this guy is and his sort of style of comics.

1062
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,440
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's a very old style, of course, you know, art wise, but it's actually even though it's really old.

1063
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,019
Speaker 0: I mean, sort of the art is better than like Superman, if you ask me.

1064
00:53:02,802 --> 00:53:04,654
Speaker 0: And it's just so wacky.

1065
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:16,860
Speaker 0: I mean, not that there's nothing else in the world that's wacky, but this sort of uniquely wacky in many ways, like a lot of the creatures and the people and the way things are drawn.

1066
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:26,220
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, like, you know, the stories about, like, you know, getting swallowed by a hippo and then, you know, the hippo has an armchair on its back.

1067
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,560
Speaker 0: And it's just it's totally and completely off the wall kind of shit.

1068
00:53:31,243 --> 00:53:34,420
Speaker 0: And actually, I really, I really like it.

1069
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,700
Speaker 0: Actually, it's still even though it's like this incredibly old humor, it's actually like so old.

1070
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,478
Speaker 0: It's funny again.

1071
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:41,560
Speaker 0: You know what?

1072
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,839
Speaker 0: I'm totally digging it.

1073
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:57,339
Speaker 0: And also the book itself, actually, someone named Craig Yo sort of, you know, took sort of, you know, these works of, you know, Booty and he compiled them into this book.

1074
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:02,660
Speaker 0: And it's from who's the publisher wasting time.

1075
00:54:03,426 --> 00:54:03,958
Speaker 0: That's all right.

1076
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:05,178
Speaker 0: You should buy.

1077
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,460
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a fan of graphics book.

1078
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:06,958
Speaker 0: Of course.

1079
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,800
Speaker 0: Who else would print out something?

1080
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,667
Speaker 0: So who else?

1081
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:10,860
Speaker 1: about Fanta graphics?

1082
00:54:11,104 --> 00:54:11,399
Speaker 0: Yes.

1083
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,260
Speaker 0: Fanta graphics is it's a twenty dollar book.

1084
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,879
Speaker 0: You can definitely see this on, you know, the Amazon or wherever you need to get it.

1085
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:21,760
Speaker 0: But you should just go and look for the cover of this book, right?

1086
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,960
Speaker 0: It doesn't cost you anything to see the cover on Amazon.

1087
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,920
Speaker 0: The bizarre comics of Booty Rogers.

1088
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:33,479
Speaker 0: And if you'll see where this is going, you see that cover and you like what you see, then you know what kind of business you're in.

1089
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,879
Speaker 1: So Timo went over and eventually directed us to the large Scandinavian presence at the MOCA this year.

1090
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:47,160
Speaker 1: Many Scandinavian artists were there, many Scandinavian comics, and one that I picked up that he highly recommended.

1091
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:48,217
Speaker 1: And I can see why.

1092
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:52,140
Speaker 1: Kha or the ring by Titu Takalo.

1093
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:53,018
Speaker 0: I got to read that.

1094
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,800
Speaker 1: Which is a Finnish comic.

1095
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,760
Speaker 1: And apparently Titu is a very up and coming comic artist.

1096
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,320
Speaker 1: But this is not available in English.

1097
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:07,200
Speaker 1: So I actually have the Finnish version and included with it is an English translation on a separate little book.

1098
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:07,918
Speaker 0: Oh, how nice.

1099
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:09,740
Speaker 1: The art is amazing.

1100
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:10,900
Speaker 1: It's about this boxer.

1101
00:55:11,663 --> 00:55:13,019
Speaker 1: And I don't want to say any more than that.

1102
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,860
Speaker 1: Other than that, this is pretty awesome.

1103
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,460
Speaker 1: And it reminds me again how much I love a lot of comics that never make it into the English language.

1104
00:55:22,062 --> 00:55:27,060
Speaker 1: I mean, remember at the New York Comic Con two years ago, all those French comics, it was just every comic.

1105
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,700
Speaker 1: There was awesome.

1106
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,280
Speaker 1: And they were all in French and none of them were in America.

1107
00:55:30,586 --> 00:55:30,860
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1108
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:37,460
Speaker 1: And I feel like Scandinavia has a slightly better chance because it seems like they're trying a lot harder.

1109
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:39,440
Speaker 1: And they're really getting these artists out here.

1110
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,440
Speaker 0: And they definitely, you know, I don't know what it is, but they definitely make a push at the MOCA.

1111
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:51,160
Speaker 0: You know, the north, the, you know, the Norway, the Sweden, the Finland, you know, they really do push at the MOCA, at least if nowhere else.

1112
00:55:51,562 --> 00:55:54,060
Speaker 0: You know, their comics to the to the United States market.

1113
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:57,760
Speaker 0: And, you know, I mean, you know, you look at Jason has made some pretty good progress.

1114
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:07,720
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, if he can if he can make some progress, so can the other ones, because, you know, I definitely am seeing a lot of stuff at that table that is, you know, just as good as Jason.

1115
00:56:08,022 --> 00:56:09,360
Speaker 0: So I'm excited.

1116
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:10,940
Speaker 1: But this was awesome.

1117
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:13,180
Speaker 1: So you should I can't say check it out.

1118
00:56:13,361 --> 00:56:18,000
Speaker 1: It might not be that easy to get just yet, but keep an eye out for to talk alone.

1119
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,960
Speaker 1: I'm sure I'm pronouncing this name incorrectly.

1120
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:26,440
Speaker 0: I'm sure Timo also pointed out this book by Tom Gauld called The Gigantic Robot.

1121
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,400
Speaker 0: And I'd seen rumblings about this book online.

1122
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,560
Speaker 0: So, you know, when Timo, you know, said, hey, you got to go check this book out, it's amazing.

1123
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:36,720
Speaker 0: And I saw the book in person.

1124
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:37,898
Speaker 0: I was like, OK, I'll buy that.

1125
00:56:38,942 --> 00:56:39,707
Speaker 1: The fact that he took.

1126
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:41,277
Speaker 1: he held it in front of me and read it to me.

1127
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:42,222
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1128
00:56:42,242 --> 00:56:43,960
Speaker 0: So let me let me read a little bit to you.

1129
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,040
Speaker 0: Of course, it doesn't really work at all without the illustration.

1130
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,660
Speaker 1: It is primarily illustration.

1131
00:56:49,761 --> 00:56:50,063
Speaker 1: Yes.

1132
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:52,620
Speaker 0: So pretty much it's this big cardboard book.

1133
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:55,340
Speaker 0: Actually, it's like these big, nice, thick cardboard pages.

1134
00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,060
Speaker 0: And all the left hand pages have words and all the right hand pages at pictures.

1135
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:00,462
Speaker 0: Right.

1136
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:04,980
Speaker 0: So page one, the war rages on page two.

1137
00:57:05,641 --> 00:57:08,519
Speaker 0: A site is chosen for the secret project.

1138
00:57:09,262 --> 00:57:13,900
Speaker 0: Page three, a mysterious structure structure is erected.

1139
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:16,859
Speaker 0: Work continues day and night.

1140
00:57:17,162 --> 00:57:19,620
Speaker 1: Each one of these is illustrated just an entire page.

1141
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,960
Speaker 0: The structure is dismantled.

1142
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,100
Speaker 0: The gigantic robot is revealed.

1143
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,638
Speaker 0: And then it goes from there.

1144
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:35,600
Speaker 0: This book, I mean, you get it only takes a few minutes to read it, but I actually spent like a good 10, 15 minutes, like really looking at it.

1145
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,419
Speaker 0: And even though I know the whole story, you know, it's just one sentence per page and one illustration per page.

1146
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:45,977
Speaker 0: Like, you can just keep looking at it over and over again, just because it's so.

1147
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:55,580
Speaker 0: it's very powerful and it's one of the better giant robot stories I've seen and it involves no giant robot fighting, which is kind of interesting.

1148
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,979
Speaker 0: The thing is, it also sort of works as a flip book.

1149
00:57:58,461 --> 00:57:58,904
Speaker 1: It's it's.

1150
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,934
Speaker 1: it's very poignant and very.

1151
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:01,960
Speaker 1: I liked it a lot.

1152
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can learn a lot from it.

1153
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,380
Speaker 0: In fact, you can learn a whole lot about a great many things.

1154
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:10,158
Speaker 0: Oh, let me read what it says on the back.

1155
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:17,182
Speaker 0: A perfect little book by Tom Gold turns futility, decay and eternity into sheer comic wonder.

1156
00:58:17,222 --> 00:58:21,975
Speaker 0: His black humor makes Beckett look timid at.

1157
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:27,867
Speaker 0: the gigantic robot is a rye fable concerning the production of an impressive secret weapon whose promise goes unfulfilled.

1158
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:28,898
Speaker 0: There you go.

1159
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,940
Speaker 0: Buena Ventura Press, Tom Gold, the gigantic robot.

1160
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:39,582
Speaker 1: So the gigantic robot was something that tried to do something with the form and did it very well.

1161
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:46,225
Speaker 1: Now, there were two independent comics not related to each other called the Wolf Cried Boy.

1162
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:48,500
Speaker 0: One of them was by the Cat in Common guy, right?

1163
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:49,448
Speaker 1: One.

1164
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:50,199
Speaker 1: Yes, I believe so.

1165
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,440
Speaker 1: And the other one was by Paul Frederick.

1166
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:57,420
Speaker 1: And I picked that one up just kind of randomly and not so impressed, to be honest.

1167
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:00,000
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm giving a bad review to a mocha book.

1168
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,924
Speaker 0: You're so mean.

1169
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:05,564
Speaker 1: But Paul Frederick, the same guy who did Don't Trust Evil Knievel, does the Wolf Cried Boy.

1170
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:11,506
Speaker 1: And it's you'll see you read it and he's trying to go somewhere with it.

1171
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:12,680
Speaker 1: It's obvious what he's doing.

1172
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,623
Speaker 1: And at the end, you get it.

1173
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:18,940
Speaker 1: But it just repeats far, far too many times.

1174
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,121
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1175
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:22,908
Speaker 0: If he would just repeat it, you know, because the boy who cried wolf is a story about repetition.

1176
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:24,120
Speaker 0: You know, it's as well.

1177
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,253
Speaker 0: If there's a wolf, no, there isn't.

1178
00:59:25,314 --> 00:59:25,659
Speaker 0: There's a wolf.

1179
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,162
Speaker 0: There's a wolf.

1180
00:59:26,202 --> 00:59:26,725
Speaker 0: No, there isn't.

1181
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:30,223
Speaker 0: You know, so is that the repeating part and then the finishing part.

1182
00:59:30,605 --> 00:59:34,583
Speaker 0: And this book, you know, does that story, of course, is the wolf who cried boy.

1183
00:59:34,663 --> 00:59:34,925
Speaker 0: Right.

1184
00:59:35,347 --> 00:59:38,140
Speaker 0: But it repeats the beginning part too many times.

1185
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,760
Speaker 0: I think if you would have just repeated the beginning part three times or two times, it would actually worked pretty well as a nice mini comic.

1186
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,219
Speaker 0: But he repeats it like five or six times.

1187
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:50,160
Speaker 0: And it's literally an exact repetition.

1188
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:56,545
Speaker 0: Like he's just literally drew some pages and copied and pasted them in order so many times.

1189
00:59:56,566 --> 00:59:57,519
Speaker 0: At least that's what it looks like.

1190
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:02,260
Speaker 0: So, you know, that repetition is sort of like you flip through to get to the end.

1191
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:04,207
Speaker 0: And the end is, you know, it's it's.

1192
01:00:04,328 --> 01:00:07,180
Speaker 0: it's the expected kind of good end of the comic.

1193
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,100
Speaker 0: I just, you know, it makes a point.

1194
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:09,442
Speaker 1: It's just.

1195
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:13,000
Speaker 1: I think it could have made its point a lot better than it just cut out.

1196
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:20,846
Speaker 0: I could just take a scissor and make the book perfect by cutting out, you know, I would have left the repetition in, but I would have made it slightly crooked every time.

1197
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:22,520
Speaker 1: That's also a good alternative.

1198
01:00:22,781 --> 01:00:27,461
Speaker 1: The fact that it wasn't slightly crooks pushed it beyond brilliant and into inane for me.

1199
01:00:27,662 --> 01:00:27,983
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1200
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:38,399
Speaker 0: If the repetition was either fewer or each repetition was slightly different from the others, that would have been, you know, but I have to talk about bone sharps, cowboys and thunder live lizards.

1201
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:49,580
Speaker 1: How could you not buy a book with that tale of Edward Drinker Cope and the Nathaniel Charles Marsh and the Gilded Age of Paleontology, the Gilded Age of Paleontology.

1202
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:57,000
Speaker 1: It's set in the Gilded Age and it's just the early days of the discovery of dinosaurs and paleontologists.

1203
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:57,602
Speaker 1: And it's just.

1204
01:00:58,285 --> 01:01:02,020
Speaker 1: it's some good old fashioned scientist paleontologist drama.

1205
01:01:03,024 --> 01:01:04,878
Speaker 0: So that's not what the cover looks like.

1206
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:13,499
Speaker 1: Well, that's what it is, quote, The Wild West provided the setting for some of the famous battles, but the gunfight at the OK Corral can't hold a candle to the bone war.

1207
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:22,983
Speaker 1: In the late eighteen hundreds, the newly reunited states dug, tunneled and blasted his way to the Pacific Ocean, exposing rock that hadn't seen the light of day for millions of years.

1208
01:01:23,707 --> 01:01:26,419
Speaker 1: Nor had the bones buried in those rocks.

1209
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:40,260
Speaker 1: Born sharps, cowboys and thunder lizards of the story of Edward Drinker Cope and Nathaniel Charles Marsh, two scientists who found and fought for those bones and the artist Charles R. Knight, who almost single handedly brought dinosaurs back to life for an awestruck public.

1210
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, that second part there, the dinosaurs back to life, awestruck public aspect.

1211
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:52,440
Speaker 1: Well, as in by taking by drawing pictures of them, there are not rampaging dinosaurs.

1212
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:58,259
Speaker 0: This is a tale of scientists because the front cover makes it look as if there are rampaging dinosaurs.

1213
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:01,279
Speaker 1: Well, the front cover you see is doing something cool and clever.

1214
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, I enjoyed it.

1215
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:16,920
Speaker 0: I thought I had not read the book and I saw that cover and I had assumed, perhaps wrongly, that the interior of the book was, you know, going to be a literal exposition of what I had seen on the cover.

1216
01:02:17,341 --> 01:02:19,399
Speaker 1: No, no, it is much more straight up.

1217
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,609
Speaker 0: OK, that's cool.

1218
01:02:20,629 --> 01:02:21,740
Speaker 0: I actually now want to read it more.

1219
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,620
Speaker 1: Knowing that you have any more or am I in the end run here?

1220
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,491
Speaker 0: You're on the end run.

1221
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:26,140
Speaker 1: All right.

1222
01:02:26,804 --> 01:02:28,020
Speaker 1: I picked up a whole bunch more.

1223
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,398
Speaker 1: I'll talk about one more because this really stands out.

1224
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:32,740
Speaker 1: Swallow Me Whole by Nate.

1225
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,040
Speaker 0: That's some top shelf, right?

1226
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,300
Speaker 0: Addison Tyler bought that so fast.

1227
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,083
Speaker 0: If you didn't buy it.

1228
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:43,339
Speaker 1: I have not read this yet, but several people in the crew did over the course of the last week.

1229
01:02:44,002 --> 01:02:48,980
Speaker 1: And every one of them has told me unabashedly and without any reservation that it is amazing.

1230
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:57,519
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell, I'm trying to avoid knowing much about it, but it is a tale of a family just going through their daily life.

1231
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,860
Speaker 1: But the grandmother is dying of a terminal illness.

1232
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:06,840
Speaker 1: And the two kind of main characters both have some mental illness.

1233
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,559
Speaker 1: Each one of them has a different mental illness.

1234
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:14,540
Speaker 1: And the story basically just kind of follows their lives from the perspective.

1235
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:23,000
Speaker 1: It kind of really illustrates what it is like to live in the real world as a real person with a real actual mental illness like schizophrenia.

1236
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:28,700
Speaker 1: And it portrays it in this loose panel kind of pseudo realism.

1237
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,380
Speaker 1: It's hard to describe, but it looks absolutely amazing.

1238
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:52,143
Speaker 1: And from the brief interview I did with Nate Powell, who wrote it, he based it is not based on a true story, but a lot of the experiences and a lot of the visuals are based on the fact that he works with people who have these mental illnesses and he knows a great deal about what it is that they experience literally through their senses on a daily basis.

1239
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,279
Speaker 1: It does not look like it is a happy read.

1240
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,109
Speaker 0: I really think you think it's going to be.

1241
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:58,391
Speaker 0: it's.

1242
01:03:58,491 --> 01:03:58,812
Speaker 0: it's a romp.

1243
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,760
Speaker 1: I will put it is a comedy romp now, but the illustrations are amazing.

1244
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,700
Speaker 1: The panel structure is all over the place and the production values.

1245
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:12,280
Speaker 1: This is a hardcover book of the highest quality.

1246
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,800
Speaker 0: I think it's a top shelf, you know, limited kind of thing.

1247
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:22,412
Speaker 0: I think the actual one is if you buy it on Amazon, be softcover, I assume usually they don't do the hardcovers like that for the it could be.

1248
01:04:22,472 --> 01:04:28,800
Speaker 1: I could be wrong to quote one of the reviewers, because I obviously haven't reviewed this yet or read it, quote in the belly of Swallow Me Hole.

1249
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:41,720
Speaker 1: There are dangling conversations, flying pills, final moments, front stoop haircuts, classroom assaults, waves of pain, loss and paranoia, and a few of what Dave Eggers would call heartbreaking tableau of staggering genius.

1250
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:48,500
Speaker 0: So actually, I don't have any more books in my pile here, but I do have a couple of the things we saw that I would like to discuss.

1251
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:49,780
Speaker 1: I have my instant mustache.

1252
01:04:50,901 --> 01:04:51,880
Speaker 0: There's one cool people.

1253
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:52,920
Speaker 0: They had instant mustache.

1254
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:54,120
Speaker 0: I think it was Joe Anarchy.

1255
01:04:55,144 --> 01:04:55,980
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good name.

1256
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:56,782
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1257
01:04:57,223 --> 01:05:04,300
Speaker 0: No, I saw at the vertigo table, they had Jeff Lemire's original new original graphic novel, Jeff Lemire.

1258
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:05,560
Speaker 1: He's the one who did Essex County.

1259
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:05,942
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1260
01:05:05,962 --> 01:05:09,887
Speaker 0: They're actually, you know, what they're coming out with complete Essex County whole thing in one book.

1261
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:11,140
Speaker 1: Oh, I should just buy that anyway.

1262
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,178
Speaker 0: Well, I have the separate books.

1263
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,500
Speaker 1: Why would you just to own give to someone else?

1264
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:14,906
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1265
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:15,820
Speaker 1: My dad, I should.

1266
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,220
Speaker 1: That's like a good gift for a dad.

1267
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:18,172
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm going to get you.

1268
01:05:18,193 --> 01:05:18,740
Speaker 0: I can get you one.

1269
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,491
Speaker 0: I can order it now.

1270
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:20,060
Speaker 0: Get discount.

1271
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, get it.

1272
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,460
Speaker 1: I'll give it to someone.

1273
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,327
Speaker 1: All right.

1274
01:05:22,347 --> 01:05:23,500
Speaker 0: The what's it called?

1275
01:05:23,883 --> 01:05:25,260
Speaker 0: So I saw his new book there.

1276
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,760
Speaker 0: One of his new books is he's doing two new books.

1277
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,040
Speaker 0: He's got original graphic novel.

1278
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,680
Speaker 0: Then he's also doing an ongoing series.

1279
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,182
Speaker 0: He's starting.

1280
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:34,579
Speaker 0: I forget the names of them right now, but I flip through it.

1281
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:39,160
Speaker 0: And Jeff Lemire is like the new hotness, as we said.

1282
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,418
Speaker 0: There is no doubt about it.

1283
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:43,660
Speaker 0: His name is basically the stamp of gold.

1284
01:05:44,363 --> 01:05:51,079
Speaker 0: If this is if you have his name with a price under it, you that's the amount of money that's escaping your wallet unless you suck.

1285
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,660
Speaker 1: Oh, I did pick this up.

1286
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:56,557
Speaker 1: I didn't know who wrote it or anything, but I will bite you.

1287
01:05:57,742 --> 01:05:58,431
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

1288
01:05:58,877 --> 01:05:59,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1289
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:02,899
Speaker 1: I got it solely because it's basically an inside joke for the front row crew.

1290
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:03,702
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1291
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:07,679
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell, the moon comes down to the sky and bite some kid.

1292
01:06:08,982 --> 01:06:09,606
Speaker 0: And that's all.

1293
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:11,960
Speaker 0: I mean, that meteor hit some kid in Russia recently, right?

1294
01:06:12,061 --> 01:06:12,465
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1295
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:12,868
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1296
01:06:13,615 --> 01:06:14,160
Speaker 0: Meteorite.

1297
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,219
Speaker 1: There was so much bite.

1298
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,560
Speaker 1: There was so much more we could talk about at the MOCA.

1299
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,220
Speaker 1: I missed a million things.

1300
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,406
Speaker 0: I do want to talk about.

1301
01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:24,259
Speaker 0: the girl had the the silhouette picture frame.

1302
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,807
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1303
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:28,120
Speaker 1: And the Victorian soaps shaped like guns.

1304
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,014
Speaker 1: Right.

1305
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:29,116
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1306
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,840
Speaker 1: Those silhouettes were brilliant because I didn't notice it first.

1307
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,980
Speaker 1: And she was like, do you like these?

1308
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:34,907
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, they're OK.

1309
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:36,600
Speaker 1: And she's like, did you really look at them?

1310
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,199
Speaker 1: And I'm like, I'm about to.

1311
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:40,019
Speaker 1: And then I realized what they were.

1312
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,282
Speaker 1: Yes.

1313
01:06:40,302 --> 01:06:42,560
Speaker 0: Like you see this table and she's got some cool stuff there.

1314
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:42,863
Speaker 0: Right.

1315
01:06:42,964 --> 01:06:44,480
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, man, that's good stuff.

1316
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,164
Speaker 0: That's good stuff.

1317
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:47,420
Speaker 0: And it's like soap in the shape of a gun.

1318
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,324
Speaker 0: What did it say on the?

1319
01:06:48,525 --> 01:06:48,967
Speaker 0: on the?

1320
01:06:49,992 --> 01:06:51,619
Speaker 0: she had like a clever saying on the soap.

1321
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,343
Speaker 1: She did.

1322
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:53,292
Speaker 1: I forget.

1323
01:06:53,353 --> 01:06:54,140
Speaker 0: I feel so bad.

1324
01:06:54,902 --> 01:06:57,000
Speaker 0: But the there were these like little picture frames.

1325
01:06:57,241 --> 01:06:59,631
Speaker 0: And I was just sort of ignoring them because they weren't sort of.

1326
01:06:59,952 --> 01:07:06,260
Speaker 0: it's like if you walk by a table quickly, you know, and there's something that's small and subtly humorous, you won't notice it.

1327
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,440
Speaker 0: You have to actually stop and look closely and examine.

1328
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:11,460
Speaker 0: And then you will see the humor.

1329
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:11,821
Speaker 0: Right.

1330
01:07:12,142 --> 01:07:21,440
Speaker 0: So actually, these are kind of a good thing, like maybe hang on the wall somewhere, these silhouette picture frames, because like anyone who looks from far away, just looks like a classy, tiny picture frame.

1331
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:23,240
Speaker 0: But if you get close, it's epic.

1332
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,284
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1333
01:07:24,484 --> 01:07:27,820
Speaker 0: Epic, epic lols of what's in the picture frames.

1334
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:29,309
Speaker 0: Totally epic.

1335
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:29,773
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1336
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:30,440
Speaker 0: Times a billion.

1337
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:32,900
Speaker 1: Oh, and we didn't actually get to see her.

1338
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,580
Speaker 1: But Kate Deaton was there, you know, fat Napoleon and all.

1339
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:40,380
Speaker 0: Oh, we also talked to Randall Monroe of XCD.

1340
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:41,663
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, we did.

1341
01:07:41,904 --> 01:07:43,069
Speaker 0: He was very.

1342
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:51,280
Speaker 0: it was weird because at the one hand, he was like, you know, basically it was a lot of other people at MOCA are always walking around, moving around.

1343
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:51,683
Speaker 0: Right.

1344
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:53,660
Speaker 0: He was sitting in his one spot.

1345
01:07:53,922 --> 01:07:55,920
Speaker 0: He had the longest line of almost anyone.

1346
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:56,402
Speaker 0: Right.

1347
01:07:57,084 --> 01:08:05,439
Speaker 0: His line was blocking off the adjacent tables and he basically had his head down and was drawing, you know, XCD sketches pretty much the whole time.

1348
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,339
Speaker 0: So when he got up to him and we're like, all right, we'll give him a break.

1349
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:10,320
Speaker 0: You know, we just chatted with him a bit.

1350
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,720
Speaker 0: You know, we had a mutual friend, you know, so we use that as a way to introduce ourselves.

1351
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,700
Speaker 1: And now, but I was like, hey, you want to give us a short interview?

1352
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,800
Speaker 1: And he's like, I'm really awkward.

1353
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,215
Speaker 0: And it would be awkward.

1354
01:08:21,256 --> 01:08:21,520
Speaker 0: It's weird.

1355
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,600
Speaker 0: He said he was awkward.

1356
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,759
Speaker 0: And he said, you know, that he felt really awkward right then and there.

1357
01:08:26,341 --> 01:08:35,020
Speaker 0: But at the same time, like in our short couple minute conversation, he said two or three things that were like epically hilarious and awesome.

1358
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:41,140
Speaker 1: Now, I probably won't do anything with this, but New York State, you realize, is a one party consent state.

1359
01:08:42,182 --> 01:08:44,694
Speaker 1: And I happen to leave the microphone on because I have the.

1360
01:08:44,715 --> 01:08:47,240
Speaker 0: how well did it record, though, if you were holding it all near your body?

1361
01:08:47,381 --> 01:08:47,662
Speaker 0: Really?

1362
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,171
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not.

1363
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:53,299
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm going to put it on the show, but I do have an entire recording of the entire conversation we had.

1364
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,640
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't like an interview conversation, though.

1365
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,200
Speaker 0: It was just sort of a person to person real conversation.

1366
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:01,560
Speaker 1: So it's not too useful, but it's always at the same time more interesting.

1367
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:02,082
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1368
01:09:02,484 --> 01:09:05,160
Speaker 0: But anyway, we thought Randall, he was never at MOCA before.

1369
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:10,274
Speaker 0: So it was really interesting and exciting to see him there and see just how many people were lining up to get XKCD.

1370
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:15,760
Speaker 1: It makes me happy that XKCD is so popular because I love XKCD.

1371
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,179
Speaker 1: It is one of my favorite comics.

1372
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:17,783
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1373
01:09:18,104 --> 01:09:23,880
Speaker 0: You know, and it's you know, if he went to like, you know, New York Comic Con, no one to be paying attention to his.

1374
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,520
Speaker 1: Well, no, because they they're there for the silver age Spider-Man and nothing more.

1375
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:33,380
Speaker 0: You know, but at the MOCA, XKCD is like, you know, longest line.

1376
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,059
Speaker 1: I think we'll have to wrap it up here.

1377
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,279
Speaker 1: But shout outs, obviously, to all the cool people we met at the MOCA.

1378
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, people who a lot of listeners stopped up and said hi.

1379
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:49,099
Speaker 1: If you want one group of kids, they they walked out with this giant pile of comics and they're like, you're probably going to review all these.

1380
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:50,859
Speaker 1: But we figured by them anyway.

1381
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:53,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, so who was it?

1382
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,220
Speaker 0: We saw I saw Ian Levenstein there.

1383
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,800
Speaker 0: We saw Ananth and George there.

1384
01:09:57,941 --> 01:09:58,142
Speaker 1: Yep.

1385
01:09:58,424 --> 01:10:00,880
Speaker 1: Oh, I did buy an awesome to awesome.

1386
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:01,846
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1387
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,300
Speaker 0: Oh, we should talk about that.

1388
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,429
Speaker 0: I didn't read it yet.

1389
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:05,519
Speaker 0: So Indy Spinnerak.

1390
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:06,205
Speaker 0: Right.

1391
01:10:06,346 --> 01:10:07,598
Speaker 0: Charlie Doe and those Mr.

1392
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,220
Speaker 0: Phil and those awesome guys over at the Indy Spinnerak podcast.

1393
01:10:10,421 --> 01:10:15,239
Speaker 0: They put out a book a year ago or so called Awesome.

1394
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,857
Speaker 0: The Awesome Anthology.

1395
01:10:16,938 --> 01:10:17,080
Speaker 0: Right.

1396
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,719
Speaker 0: So I bought it because, you know, I love those guys and I'm totally cool with them.

1397
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,207
Speaker 0: And it's basically just.

1398
01:10:23,227 --> 01:10:25,719
Speaker 0: they just got a bunch of their artists, you know, that they know.

1399
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:29,940
Speaker 0: Comic artists to sort of contribute a few pages, you know, a short little bits.

1400
01:10:30,442 --> 01:10:34,159
Speaker 0: And they made this anthology book called The Awesome Anthology, and they sold it.

1401
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:39,360
Speaker 0: And, you know, with the money, they were able to support Indy Spinnerak, of course.

1402
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:47,138
Speaker 0: And two, they set up a scholarship to send someone to the Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont and actually the Center for Cartoon Studies at a table there.

1403
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:53,980
Speaker 0: So they decided, hey, let's do awesome to awesomer.

1404
01:10:54,903 --> 01:10:57,220
Speaker 1: So it's three going to be awesomest and then that's it?

1405
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:03,000
Speaker 0: I have no idea, but they did awesome to awesomer and it's awesomer in many ways.

1406
01:11:03,101 --> 01:11:04,519
Speaker 0: First of all, it's bigger and better.

1407
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:14,800
Speaker 0: Second of all, they're still doing the, you know, donation to a scholarship to go to the Center for Cartoon Studies and it is published by Top Shelf.

1408
01:11:15,502 --> 01:11:18,200
Speaker 0: So it's like 100 times awesome in all directions.

1409
01:11:18,681 --> 01:11:25,039
Speaker 0: And because it's published by Top Shelf, it'll actually be a lot easier for normal people to buy it than was awesome one.

1410
01:11:25,641 --> 01:11:32,540
Speaker 0: So if you can go and look for awesome to awesomer and it is worth pretty much everything.

1411
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,560
Speaker 0: And it has a Jeff Smith cover.

1412
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,858
Speaker 0: Jeff Smith of Bone.

1413
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:36,878
Speaker 0: That's that.

1414
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:41,440
Speaker 0: Jeff Smith did the cover for this book and that alone means you should buy it.

1415
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,920
Speaker 0: I mean, I preordered it and I made him buy another one anyway.

1416
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:49,640
Speaker 1: Ah, and I think that wraps it up, though, breaking little news for us.

1417
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,457
Speaker 1: You know, we did all the convention stuff early, but we have scheduled.

1418
01:11:53,477 --> 01:12:00,492
Speaker 1: we have finally set in stone the schedule for the first of our possibly numerous panels at PAX West this year.

1419
01:12:00,928 --> 01:12:01,197
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

1420
01:12:01,601 --> 01:12:03,879
Speaker 1: Friday, September 4th at eleven thirty a.m.

1421
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,199
Speaker 1: to twelve thirty p.m.

1422
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,439
Speaker 1: in the way one time eleven a.m.

1423
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,183
Speaker 1: to twelve thirty.

1424
01:12:09,264 --> 01:12:12,100
Speaker 0: that interferes with any sort of keynote action.

1425
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:13,379
Speaker 0: I swear to God.

1426
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,300
Speaker 1: In the Raven Theater, we will be doing Beyond Candy Land.

1427
01:12:18,623 --> 01:12:20,040
Speaker 0: No, really?

1428
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:20,620
Speaker 1: Yes.

1429
01:12:20,963 --> 01:12:21,459
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

1430
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:22,259
Speaker 0: I didn't think we got that.

1431
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,180
Speaker 0: We get that one accepted.

1432
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,700
Speaker 1: Neither did I. I thought we were doing the other three.

1433
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,960
Speaker 0: So sweet.

1434
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:31,780
Speaker 0: But if that interferes with the freaking keynote, I swear to God, the thing is, at least we've seen one.

1435
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,739
Speaker 1: We've already moved on to doing big things.

1436
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't want it says the thing.

1437
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:38,360
Speaker 0: Pax, unlike the other conventions, has the big events that everyone goes to.

1438
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,780
Speaker 0: And I really don't want to be set.

1439
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,320
Speaker 0: There's so much time that is not opposite them.

1440
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:49,320
Speaker 0: I feel like they shouldn't even put anything opposite them except for, you know, the the always open stuff like the, you know, here anyway.

1441
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it'll work out.

1442
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,279
Speaker 0: All right.

1443
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,259
Speaker 0: Is that it?

1444
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:59,720
Speaker 0: That's the only thing that's scheduled for now that I'm just now like right now getting all the emails to put Beyond Candy Land on the kinetic on schedule.

1445
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:00,158
Speaker 1: Yes.

1446
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:00,980
Speaker 1: Easily done.

1447
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:10,130
