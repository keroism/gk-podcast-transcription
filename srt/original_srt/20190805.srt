1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,741
Speaker 1: It's Monday August 5th 2019.

2
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:19,210
Speaker 1: I'm random Scott and this is geek nights tonight USBC the connector to finally rule them all.

3
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:23,396
Speaker 0: for now sort of Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,736
Speaker 1: You know in geek nights We have a story tradition of.

5
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:30,351
Speaker 1: you know We have a very regular format over these last 14 or so years of.

6
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:37,464
Speaker 1: we do an opening bit where we talk about our lives Then we do the news then we do a thing at the day and then I've met a moment in a main bit We have this whole thing.

7
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:41,860
Speaker 1: So my only question is which one of us should do our opening bit first today?

8
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:42,526
Speaker 0: It don't matter.

9
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,070
Speaker 1: You don't matter.

10
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:43,615
Speaker 0: What is it?

11
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:44,180
Speaker 0: Who cares?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,726
Speaker 1: All right, so I was at work today.

13
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,783
Speaker 1: do my normal thing around 11 Like I do.

14
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,795
Speaker 1: I went to go have my daily poop because I am hyper regular.

15
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,285
Speaker 1: now that I'm in my 30s 11 seems to be the time.

16
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,860
Speaker 0: most dudes poop and dude, I guess you couldn't get a stall cuz everyone's poop.

17
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,080
Speaker 0: I don't know cuz I know the secret because basically you go to a floor no one's poop.

18
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:14,681
Speaker 1: There are only three stalls in each bathroom like in the bathrooms on each lot one of them you put a pair of shoes Up until the 16th floor is the floor I'm on but 17 18 19 20 21 and 22.

19
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:22,580
Speaker 1: Daddy, like eight stalls you go up a flight of stairs I go up one flight and I'd like it pretty easy and if I really am desperate I go up to 22.

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,716
Speaker 1: No one thinks to go up to 22 22 is an awesome floor.

21
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:26,077
Speaker 0: No one.

22
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:30,729
Speaker 1: on 22 There's a small office up there for like certain things like.

23
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:33,859
Speaker 0: there's like a million stalls and only one desk and there's two.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,233
Speaker 1: it's it Basically, it's the floor with the big conference room for like big outside events.

25
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,120
Speaker 0: So if there isn't an event, there's like no one.

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no one up there.

27
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,833
Speaker 1: so I can like go out on the balcony.

28
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:43,335
Speaker 1: It's real.

29
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:45,384
Speaker 1: I can see the skyline I just hang out up there.

30
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:45,866
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

31
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,180
Speaker 1: But sometimes I go up there and there's a whole bunch of people and I can't poop.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, having a party.

33
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:55,039
Speaker 1: So I have my poop like I do and I played like for nourishing my hexes during it.

34
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:56,570
Speaker 0: You trying out those new armies?

35
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:57,759
Speaker 1: No, they're not in the app yet.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,383
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

37
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,320
Speaker 1: I was in the app trying to figure out how to buy them and I couldn't figure it out.

38
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:08,400
Speaker 1: Okay I don't think you can so email and I got a flush but like a good person who's worried about his health and careful.

39
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:12,693
Speaker 1: I turn around and look before I flush as your poop just like green.

40
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:13,856
Speaker 1: So my work yellow.

41
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,060
Speaker 1: It was green orange.

42
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:16,594
Speaker 1: It was the bright.

43
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:23,640
Speaker 1: it looked like Green neon highlighter and like just taking the inside out and dropped it in like a lie.

44
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:24,906
Speaker 0: You ate some kind of thing.

45
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,620
Speaker 0: So I thought to myself what vegetable did you eat?

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,777
Speaker 1: So I thought to myself I have never seen a color that stark before.

47
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:33,740
Speaker 0: Let's take a photo of your poop.

48
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:34,940
Speaker 1: No, I didn't even take a photo.

49
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,220
Speaker 1: So I thought on it for a second because I know that green poop is like a bile thing.

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,163
Speaker 1: But I look it wasn't.

51
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:43,097
Speaker 1: that kind of color was way too bright, but I remembered last night.

52
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:43,940
Speaker 0: You ate a highlighter.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,691
Speaker 1: We went to Ice and Vice the fancy ice cream place.

54
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,976
Speaker 0: You had some food coloring in your ice cream.

55
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:54,974
Speaker 1: Their cones Have food coloring in them and I remembered back to not digestible food coloring.

56
00:02:54,994 --> 00:03:00,495
Speaker 1: last time I went there and I had a similar incident and I realized that that is the problem.

57
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:08,787
Speaker 1: the last time I went there I had a pink cone and the next day when I pooped it looked like I Thought I was bleeding to death for a second.

58
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:12,684
Speaker 0: You should I remember email them and be like, hey your food coloring Makes me poop the color.

59
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,620
Speaker 1: I should be like, hey, you could put a little less food coloring in these cones.

60
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,085
Speaker 0: You could warn people about it.

61
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:19,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

62
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,300
Speaker 1: I have an extreme ice cream warning on the door.

63
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:24,646
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

64
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,550
Speaker 1: is your thing today?

65
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,996
Speaker 1: Hopefully not also poop related.

66
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:32,352
Speaker 0: No, so Someone posted on the internet about you know, some some science.

67
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,037
Speaker 0: so signed up to do the science.

68
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,871
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah that thing.

69
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:48,163
Speaker 0: so basically Someone at Columbia is researching the associations between like air pollution biking to work You know cardio Whatever

70
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:56,321
Speaker 1: makes sense because on one hand you want to do a lot of cardio But on the other hand like especially in a city doing a lot of cardio every day means some days the air is really bad Right,

71
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:57,044
Speaker 0: so basically

72
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:57,947
Speaker 1: more pollution.

73
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:58,790
Speaker 0: So yes.

74
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,169
Speaker 0: Anyway, I signed up to go do this study, you know, help them out Cuz it's of interest to me.

75
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,019
Speaker 0: It's not the kind where they pay you.

76
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:11,580
Speaker 0: So apparently you only really get paid for Scientific studies and a. they got a lot of grant money and they're having a hard time finding people to do it for free.

77
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,431
Speaker 0: I got paid at RIT once yeah, and B they do it you.

78
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:18,459
Speaker 0: they usually pay people when you're like you're doing something risky, right?

79
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,437
Speaker 0: It's like take this experimental medicine and it's like we'll give you money.

80
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:24,320
Speaker 0: All right

81
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:31,150
Speaker 1: I remember one of my RIT professors talking about how he did a study where they paid him like a hundred bucks Which in the 70s, that's

82
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,693
Speaker 0: a lot of money,

83
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:39,139
Speaker 1: but the study was Drink a whole bunch of alcohol and then inhale mercury vapor and see how much mercury vapor gets into your blood.

84
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:46,445
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, okay anyway, so I went up there and they gave me a whole bunch of sensors and shit So that they gave me.

85
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,415
Speaker 0: the first thing they gave me are these two.

86
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:49,219
Speaker 0: I have them over here.

87
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,220
Speaker 0: I had to carry them around so I had to do it six times.

88
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:59,646
Speaker 0: So basically six 24-hour periods over three weeks, but not consecutively Not on consecutive days.

89
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,967
Speaker 0: So I had to do basically two days a week for three weeks But not two days in a row ever.

90
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,120
Speaker 0: All right, and I got a bike to work on those days.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,625
Speaker 0: Otherwise is you know, what's the point right?

92
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:13,007
Speaker 0: So they gave me two different kinds of air pollution sensor things They gave me.

93
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,002
Speaker 0: is I got to carry them around and they're just always drinking the air I guess.

94
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:24,240
Speaker 0: and then they gave me this hexo skin shirt Which is like a undershirt thing and it has a little data recorder.

95
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,148
Speaker 1: Oh, it will it catch your log respiration rate and all that it has.

96
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,160
Speaker 0: basically it's like an easy G situation with three contact points.

97
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,751
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's not doing the chest expansion thing.

98
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:44,380
Speaker 0: and also it has these two hex Strips that go around my entire body and I guess they can tell when I'm my body is stretching And they use that to measure how much air I've worn.

99
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:48,934
Speaker 1: I've worn one of those something very similar before right because I guess they do some cut.

100
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,921
Speaker 0: she's like, yeah, you do some volume Right.

101
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,494
Speaker 0: It's like if your chest expands this much that means this much air came out.

102
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,920
Speaker 0: and if the air pollution is this much That means you breathe in this many particles.

103
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:09,080
Speaker 1: Things I know because I've done a bunch of medical things with those that kind of equipment before and I've been thinking about buying One of those strap sensors, I don't need the EKG nonsense, but I like the respiration sensor

104
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:10,186
Speaker 0: anyway, so cuz

105
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,077
Speaker 1: I'm trying to train more seriously in the running.

106
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:19,159
Speaker 0: and then Basically a blood pressure monitor that you can like wear and it checks your blood pressure periodically just on its own.

107
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,520
Speaker 0: And then she's like do you want to take this extra thing?

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,860
Speaker 0: It's like you don't have to and it was basically this thing some dude in Belgium made.

109
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:31,660
Speaker 0: So the dude in Belgium wants it's like a separate study, but it's related.

110
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:33,119
Speaker 0: So it's like you can do both at once.

111
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:40,385
Speaker 0: He wants to know about if there's a relation between like noise and air pollution like yeah It's noisier.

112
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:43,559
Speaker 0: then that means there's more cars and shits is more pollution, right?

113
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,179
Speaker 0: So he basically I'm pretty sure it's an Arduino in a box.

114
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:53,900
Speaker 0: But yeah as far as I'm concerned It's just a box and I just tie the box to my bike and plug it in when I ride and that's it.

115
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:59,580
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna carry this shit around six times and then I don't have to go back to stupid Columbia.

116
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,137
Speaker 0: I they're just gonna come and get the stuff.

117
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:04,179
Speaker 0: I don't have to go back there.

118
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:08,460
Speaker 1: I'm glad you're doing this cuz I have a vested interest in the results of this kind of research, right?

119
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,426
Speaker 0: So we're gonna find out.

120
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,700
Speaker 0: it's like well, you know you bike to work.

121
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,470
Speaker 0: Oh so healthy, but you breathe in all this poison.

122
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,200
Speaker 0: if you were in a car that has filters on its air intakes.

123
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:18,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't breathe the poison.

124
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:22,673
Speaker 1: you would just poison everyone And it'll probably figure like what's the balance between?

125
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:27,720
Speaker 1: yes, the pollution is bad for you But the exercise is better for you than the pollution is right.

126
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,860
Speaker 0: It's like my blood pressure like worse when I'm biking in a bad place.

127
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,684
Speaker 1: Well kind of like.

128
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,516
Speaker 0: I also have to use Strava and send her my struggle files.

129
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:40,079
Speaker 1: Oh, no You saw Strava had a big outage the other day.

130
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,486
Speaker 0: I didn't notice they were.

131
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:46,247
Speaker 1: basically if you went into the app and had a big banner that was like yo We know we're having problems.

132
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:47,331
Speaker 1: Stop read.

133
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,640
Speaker 1: Stop restarting the app over and over again.

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,890
Speaker 1: It's just making things worse.

135
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,555
Speaker 1: We're gonna fix it.

136
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,140
Speaker 1: Just give us time.

137
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,968
Speaker 1: Seriously, calm down kids.

138
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,940
Speaker 0: You shouldn't tell people just fix it.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Speaker 1: Don't look as if they were trying to fix it.

140
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,993
Speaker 1: But apparently people kept saying oh my runs aren't sinking.

141
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:04,227
Speaker 1: and they kept like yeah Well, that's tough shit.

142
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,920
Speaker 0: Just make sure that shouldn't affect whether you make it work or not.

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, just go to your firewall and block everybody until you fix your shit.

144
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I agree.

145
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:16,718
Speaker 0: as a product manager If it's down you might as well just block them having time out.

146
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:22,900
Speaker 1: Yep Also Strava unlike say a real work thing not that important if it's down for a little while.

147
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,121
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not the end of the world It's not.

148
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,710
Speaker 1: it's not a Sev one at the data center.

149
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:32,792
Speaker 0: if I was the boss of Strava and they're like Strava is down Oh my god, I'd be like, yeah, well, you know, it's like.

150
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,740
Speaker 0: worst case, you know, don't work on the weekend.

151
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,126
Speaker 0: Worst case all the premium people.

152
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,440
Speaker 0: we can just you know, refund them for the weekends worth of money, right?

153
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, give them some sort of bonus fake feature.

154
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:48,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone gets a free month If you're if you're a premium buy whatever pays for that because I it doesn't do any.

155
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,280
Speaker 0: I don't know any feature.

156
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,552
Speaker 0: It's on the premium that I does as I feel I need to pay for.

157
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:54,580
Speaker 1: it has a safety feature that I don't really need.

158
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,942
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

159
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:56,624
Speaker 0: safety feature?

160
00:08:56,664 --> 00:09:02,300
Speaker 1: so you can basically list other Strava users and like people as your contacts and you can tell it.

161
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:06,237
Speaker 1: I'm going for a run and I want my friends to track me and it'll tell all of them where you are.

162
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,231
Speaker 1: the whole time It has like a panic button seems not necessary.

163
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:09,914
Speaker 1: I could.

164
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:11,060
Speaker 1: there are use cases for that.

165
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,880
Speaker 0: I have other apps to do that like Google trusted contact.

166
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:16,006
Speaker 1: Yeah There are there uses for that.

167
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:19,840
Speaker 1: people who do serious overland hiking people are at risk of assault.

168
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:21,888
Speaker 1: No, I can see.

169
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,093
Speaker 1: but again it worries me.

170
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:24,640
Speaker 0: Strava is not the app for that is what I'm saying.

171
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a feature and a whole bunch of this analysis stuff.

172
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:28,680
Speaker 1: That just seems silly.

173
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,509
Speaker 0: There's some people who are like super like.

174
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:31,750
Speaker 0: that's.

175
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,980
Speaker 0: their main thing is tracking the data on their body.

176
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:37,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I am like they're getting home and they're spread sheeting their body daily.

177
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:44,193
Speaker 1: I mean, I collect all this data But I don't look at it except in like the most abstract aggregate of like.

178
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,540
Speaker 1: am I getting faster or slower?

179
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,823
Speaker 1: over time How am I?

180
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:49,586
Speaker 1: how am I doing?

181
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,532
Speaker 1: is my 5k time actually getting worse?

182
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:53,980
Speaker 0: got faster, but you got older and it evened out.

183
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't need an app to tell me that.

184
00:09:56,732 --> 00:10:05,660
Speaker 1: so in the news this story Escalated rapidly and I think it's worth the time to unpack this because a lot of people don't understand how any of this works.

185
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,899
Speaker 1: So back it all the way up.

186
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,880
Speaker 1: There is a website filled with the most the second most vile people on earth called 8chan.

187
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,007
Speaker 1: 8chan is not 4chan.

188
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's twice as shitty.

189
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:20,868
Speaker 1: That's the best way to think of it.

190
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,102
Speaker 1: the higher the number the shittier the place Like.

191
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:26,080
Speaker 0: I feel like if you're 8chan would people get banned from 4chan?

192
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,702
Speaker 0: I mean literally.

193
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:27,905
Speaker 0: 8chan didn't even ban anything.

194
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:39,620
Speaker 1: 8chan was formed by this gamer Gator dude, basically Who now who is since as vile as that dude is he has actually come out today and said that he disavows 8chan.

195
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,463
Speaker 1: It was a mistake.

196
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:41,526
Speaker 1: shut it down.

197
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:42,570
Speaker 1: It is dangerous.

198
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,212
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

199
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:50,415
Speaker 0: So even that shitty gamer game That's pretty the only thing that really amazes me these days when someone changes their mind.

200
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,040
Speaker 0: No, they didn't change his mind.

201
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:55,597
Speaker 0: It's the vile people who somehow have a line.

202
00:10:55,617 --> 00:11:00,355
Speaker 1: Yeah 4chan pretty vile, but they had a line that their line was like this person.

203
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,098
Speaker 0: It's like they.

204
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,648
Speaker 0: they're racist They don't unracist right?

205
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:04,953
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they're.

206
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:06,720
Speaker 0: they're like, they're all these bad things.

207
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:18,589
Speaker 0: They're misogynist and they don't they don't turn they don't change their ways They still agree with all those bad things, but then somehow at some point they're like that's too far bro, and it's like Well, are you gonna be a good person?

208
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,139
Speaker 0: No, I just draw the line at this much badness.

209
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the only person that surprises me ever.

210
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:25,238
Speaker 0: Is that person?

211
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:27,467
Speaker 0: But does that person exist?

212
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:28,573
Speaker 0: he's right there a chain guy.

213
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:36,080
Speaker 1: so basically 4chan Didn't have a lot of rules, but they banned furries for cultural and internet reasons, whatever.

214
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:42,640
Speaker 1: They banned pedophilia You know porn you don't say and they banned gamer gate.

215
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,446
Speaker 1: Those are the only things that they banned.

216
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:49,900
Speaker 1: and those people were so affronted that they made a chance.

217
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,052
Speaker 0: Sorry, didn't go to H.

218
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:55,327
Speaker 1: No the furries Everyone else went to HN.

219
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,831
Speaker 1: the bad people went to HN.

220
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,977
Speaker 1: So HN is there and it's awful.

221
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:06,160
Speaker 1: and Three of the more recent like mass murderers in the world posted their manifestos to HN.

222
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:15,533
Speaker 1: And if you actually go to HN Which I do not recommend you do you will find some of the most vile Hate speech and incitement to violence the world has ever seen.

223
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:17,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are bad people.

224
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why we just don't go, you know round up everyone on HN.

225
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,753
Speaker 1: The pro move would have been if HN was just a long-running honeypot.

226
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,559
Speaker 0: Just swap them for the immigrants.

227
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:31,440
Speaker 1: Just The only place worse than HN is gab.

228
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,742
Speaker 0: Gab.

229
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:34,348
Speaker 0: Gab is just HN reddit, right?

230
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:35,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gab is like HN.

231
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,560
Speaker 1: reddit slash Twitter.

232
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:42,179
Speaker 0: It's a site that's like reddit, but it's you know for bad people that the kind that would go to HN.

233
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine the kind of content that even Twitter who won't ban anyone Practically would ban.

234
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,009
Speaker 1: they go to gab and HN.

235
00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:00,293
Speaker 1: So HN only was able to exist because Cloudflare Provided services to them like DDoS protection.

236
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,036
Speaker 0: You don't know right?

237
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:01,900
Speaker 1: It's all load balance.

238
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:12,869
Speaker 0: So Cloudflare is a company that's been around for a while and they made their name In the back in the day because what would happen is certain sites good or bad would get DOS or DDoS.

239
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:21,939
Speaker 0: Yep, and there is a difference a big difference Yeah, but the point is their site would go down and they did not have enough money to say You know do a Google does and run a huge worldwide network of servers.

240
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:29,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, that are invincible and you know have a huge IT staff, you know, maybe you just got your WordPress blog But you got an awesome article that's getting really popular.

241
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's spreading like wildfire.

242
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,412
Speaker 0: Maybe you got slash dotted or something, right?

243
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,440
Speaker 0: And it's not spreading a good message.

244
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,353
Speaker 0: But you you know, you got so much traffic you're down or because you're a good person The hate people are taking you down or you might not even it might.

245
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:46,064
Speaker 1: you just might have a lot of traffic and it's not Even a DDoS.

246
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,994
Speaker 0: you just you're just one person.

247
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,019
Speaker 0: you can't handle that.

248
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:52,080
Speaker 0: You can't handle the architecture of that nature for your use case.

249
00:13:52,221 --> 00:14:00,280
Speaker 1: But if you have wizards working for you like between IP table There's a lot of stuff you can do on servers to mitigate that up to a point, but there's a limit, right?

250
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,699
Speaker 0: So Cloudflare what they do is they provide basically a CDN but also other stuff and the way it works.

251
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,888
Speaker 1: CDN is content distribution network.

252
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:11,983
Speaker 1: in case you have no idea what we're talking about you point your DNS Right you.

253
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,171
Speaker 0: basically Cloudflare becomes your DNS provider.

254
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,637
Speaker 0: Yep, and I'm actually use them.

255
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:18,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's free.

256
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:27,069
Speaker 0: And you go there and you say okay for a front row crew calm The IP address is X and you tell them right.

257
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:30,420
Speaker 0: and now you tell your registrar where you bought the domain.

258
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,840
Speaker 0: Hey for DNS use Cloudflare and then you're all good.

259
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,179
Speaker 0: And what you do is in the list of DNS the entries on Cloudflare.

260
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,423
Speaker 0: They have these little icons.

261
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:43,760
Speaker 0: you click and you have two options an arrow going around a cloud or an arrow going through a cloud.

262
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,736
Speaker 0: So an arrow going around the cloud means anyone visiting front row crew calm will go directly.

263
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:54,573
Speaker 0: their web browser Will send its easy VIP request boom directly to your web server wherever it is.

264
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:55,736
Speaker 0: line ode Oz.

265
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:56,880
Speaker 1: very useful for example.

266
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,092
Speaker 1: Front end verse back end like as a content creator.

267
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,720
Speaker 1: I am doing a lot of things.

268
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:10,498
Speaker 0: I don't need this cloud protection for right and if you click the icon to go through the cloud What what will happen is when their web browser says what's the IP address of front row?

269
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:10,980
Speaker 0: crew calm?

270
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,140
Speaker 0: It'll actually give you an IP address for some Cloudflare server.

271
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:16,991
Speaker 0: The HTTP request will go to the Cloudflare server.

272
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,440
Speaker 0: the Cloudflare server will then go to your real server.

273
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:27,056
Speaker 0: Get the copy of your web page and then cache it and then send it and the next person who comes visiting It's probably gonna see a cached version.

274
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:33,300
Speaker 0: mostly You've probably seen times where people's like servers go down and you'll get like the Cloudflare error page.

275
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:35,268
Speaker 0: It's like oh, yeah, we didn't.

276
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:41,000
Speaker 0: we don't have a recent version of this web page and they went down You know because maybe they stopped paying for their odds or whatever.

277
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:51,393
Speaker 0: So also in addition to providing that sort of caching CDN kind of stuff They also provide just all this sort of attack protection.

278
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:57,052
Speaker 0: and way it works is since they have so many Customers and clients and and you know things they see.

279
00:15:57,212 --> 00:16:02,460
Speaker 1: every kind of attack under the Sun and DDoS is hard to stop if you're the target by yourself.

280
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:05,900
Speaker 1: But if you have the data of all the other attacks around right?

281
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,200
Speaker 0: It's like let's say rims got a website and I got a website and someone attacks rims website with some lame-o attack.

282
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, Cloudflare sees that attack.

283
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:18,520
Speaker 0: They write a you know, some kind of rule to block it usually a simple heuristic rule like from the package themselves.

284
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,040
Speaker 1: You can figure out if they're malicious.

285
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:28,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh there's an evil server over there and then suddenly every other Cloudflare customer Everyone else using Cloudflare is now protected from that exact same attack.

286
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:35,673
Speaker 0: So and they save all these over time forever It just if you use Cloudflare, you're protected from like an insane number of attacks.

287
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,840
Speaker 0: It's it actually really works.

288
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,722
Speaker 0: It's super legit.

289
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:45,080
Speaker 0: the people who work there regardless of your opinion of other decisions they've made which we're gonna discuss right now.

290
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, their technology is Excellent and competent.

291
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:49,974
Speaker 0: I think we've actually they.

292
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,536
Speaker 0: When there's an internet outage.

293
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:59,360
Speaker 0: recently They wrote the article about why it was out and remember we talked about how they were blaming some provider in Pennsylvania or something.

294
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:03,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was Cloudflare doing that because their internet engineering is good.

295
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:12,920
Speaker 1: now in terms of ethics The problem with Cloudflare is that they have taken a very extreme free speech position almost extreme.

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,680
Speaker 0: They have a line just short of the most extreme free and their line was the Daily Stormer and now 8chan, right?

297
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,489
Speaker 0: So Daily Stormer is the first thing to ever get kicked off.

298
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,135
Speaker 1: Do not Google Daily Stormer.

299
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,747
Speaker 0: It's just a Nazi newspaper Yeah, but it's nothing I know about.

300
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:29,059
Speaker 1: it's the Nazi newspaper, right?

301
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,983
Speaker 0: That's like I didn't know.

302
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:38,567
Speaker 0: so they after being on Cloudflare for quite some time Cloudflare kicked it off and after a massive public protest That was and that was our.

303
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:46,380
Speaker 0: that was a news on geek nights because it was like the CEOs Decision to override their policy and they made a big deal about how reluctant they were to do it.

304
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:52,320
Speaker 1: Speech right just as aside cuz I don't want to talk about that in this episode, but fuck that.

305
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,573
Speaker 1: Free speech for everyone but Nazis.

306
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very easy Yeah, sure, but they.

307
00:17:59,063 --> 00:17:59,986
Speaker 0: So now 8chan.

308
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,013
Speaker 0: it took them this long to decide.

309
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:09,917
Speaker 0: it took no one not two But three mass murders three mass murder manifestos in 8chan and Cloudflare decided that was enough.

310
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:19,464
Speaker 0: and they're like, yeah They're sort of leaning a little bit more away from the extreme free speech being like, yeah, we're private We don't have to you know, recognize free speech here Yeah, but we try to.

311
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:23,360
Speaker 0: and there you know what, even though they took down 8chan good job Cloudflare.

312
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:29,880
Speaker 0: There are still plenty of hate sites that they're that are customers that they have not gotten rid of.

313
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,675
Speaker 0: yep, and I took a sweet long as time to get rid of the two that they have gotten rid of.

314
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:38,700
Speaker 1: and I generally want Technology providers to be agnostic to content.

315
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,693
Speaker 1: But again, there's that you can make a very clear line on certain kinds of.

316
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,301
Speaker 0: I think it's like people argue the slippery slope Right.

317
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:49,678
Speaker 0: They're like, oh first the Nazis then the furries then it's like we could just stop it.

318
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:50,723
Speaker 0: not good It's like.

319
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:54,222
Speaker 0: it's like yeah, maybe they'll go down the slippery slope But maybe they won't.

320
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:58,497
Speaker 0: so wait until they ban something that you're actually against before you yell at them.

321
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:06,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like yeah, if they ban some perfectly, you know good site tomorrow, then I'll Yeah.

322
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,693
Speaker 0: Anyway, so cloud flare good and bad.

323
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:16,109
Speaker 1: So cloud flare kick them out Yep, but as everyone expected cloud flare, they even said something.

324
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:21,539
Speaker 1: the effect of the problem is the problem isn't with 8chan The problem is with America.

325
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,868
Speaker 1: They're gonna find another provider.

326
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:29,807
Speaker 0: guys daily stormer did find another place to get hosted and so Tor and dark web which we talked about.

327
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:35,723
Speaker 1: so daily stormer and and now 8chan But only temporarily.

328
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,191
Speaker 1: they found a new service.

329
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,836
Speaker 1: There's a service called bit mitigate.

330
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:41,000
Speaker 0: Well, why are you sharing the name?

331
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,580
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna link to them because it's gonna be talked about in this article.

332
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:52,111
Speaker 1: But this is kind of important because bit mitigate is basically Kind of like how 8chan was formed with the people banned from 4chan.

333
00:19:52,412 --> 00:20:00,480
Speaker 1: bit mitigate is formed with the people banned from cloud Similar technology to what cloud flare does and they basically focus on the worst people on earth.

334
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,570
Speaker 0: It's an inferior product, but it's not.

335
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,763
Speaker 0: you know, I guess it works, right and Works well enough.

336
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:11,160
Speaker 1: So bit mitigate now was hosting daily stormer as far as I can or like doing protection.

337
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,320
Speaker 1: Well, you have to hosting in a second for daily stormer and 8chan was my migrating over there and they were gonna be fine.

338
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,651
Speaker 0: I don't know why the other like hate sites.

339
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,500
Speaker 0: don't just like, you know, go right away.

340
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,550
Speaker 0: It's like they stay with cloud for as long as they can.

341
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,434
Speaker 1: cloud flares free.

342
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:26,680
Speaker 1: I don't think that mitigate is free.

343
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:40,960
Speaker 1: I mean think if you it makes like being the IT guy for the mob if you're the DDoS Protector for the Nazis You're gonna charge a premium to be like the arms dealer to these shitty people share any by an AK's on the black marketing.

344
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,522
Speaker 0: So when this?

345
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:45,400
Speaker 0: so when this happened, it's like well the bit mitigate which I guess is owned by some company.

346
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,393
Speaker 1: Oh the rabbit hole gets deep.

347
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,460
Speaker 1: you gotta read article.

348
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,785
Speaker 0: So, you know It's owned by some other company.

349
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:55,985
Speaker 0: and I was like and I said when we were discussing that when the news had reached that point Of like yeah, they're going to this company.

350
00:20:56,045 --> 00:21:00,400
Speaker 0: I was like, well that company is still hosting their service somewhere like a data center.

351
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,040
Speaker 0: I doubt they have their own data center.

352
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,236
Speaker 0: so we could call the data center and let them know and the data center could fire them as a customer.

353
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:08,207
Speaker 0: and even if they Have their own data center.

354
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,400
Speaker 0: We can go to the data center, right?

355
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,989
Speaker 0: You know, you could do something about the town.

356
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,660
Speaker 0: you get them to cut the electricity off.

357
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,306
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, that's the avenue to attack this now, right?

358
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:20,170
Speaker 0: Especially once all the bad people are in one basket like that, right?

359
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:25,189
Speaker 0: but as it turns out They weren't using their own data center.

360
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,656
Speaker 0: They were in some data center box.

361
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,342
Speaker 0: ility is Silly.

362
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,770
Speaker 1: they're just an infrastructure as a service provider.

363
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,512
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them.

364
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:32,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just a data center.

365
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:33,919
Speaker 1: somewhere turns out.

366
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:37,509
Speaker 1: bitmitigate Uses them as their outsource infrastructure.

367
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,640
Speaker 0: They don't own their own computers, which I thought would be pretty rare if they did.

368
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, very few people own their own and voxility was not in on this game.

369
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,052
Speaker 0: So voxility is just like yeah fire you as a customer get the hell out of here.

370
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaker 1: voxility basically said quote.

371
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:57,647
Speaker 1: We provide services to ISPs and hosting resellers and as a telco we do not have access to websites hosted by Customers of our customers.

372
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:58,170
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

373
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:04,040
Speaker 1: We cannot deal with the websites directly But we are now working on removing this reseller from the network.

374
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:11,760
Speaker 1: So basically once people figured out that bitmitigate was hosted on voxility Voxility said fuck this and just kicked him out.

375
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,287
Speaker 1: Yeah so right now you can.

376
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:24,759
Speaker 0: you can always keep figuring out like For them to avoid the only only by using the dark web and like hosting in their houses, but that's fine dark web Not discoverable by the average Nazi.

377
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,009
Speaker 0: It's like how to host yourself.

378
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,280
Speaker 0: You need a ton of money to have your own data center.

379
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:35,520
Speaker 0: You'd have to get someone to agree to like link your data center to the internet, right?

380
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,856
Speaker 0: It's like at some point you have to do something with someone.

381
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:39,520
Speaker 0: It's a network.

382
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:48,089
Speaker 1: You have to get someone to agree to network with you and if you piss everybody else off you're you're not on the internet You're just your own little net.

383
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's so.

384
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,548
Speaker 1: Voxility did the right thing and the rabbit.

385
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:58,809
Speaker 1: so now as of like Dateline right now live doing this show at like 6 45 p.m on August 5th.

386
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,773
Speaker 1: Daily Stormer and a Chan are just down.

387
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:02,820
Speaker 1: good like they're not.

388
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:03,524
Speaker 1: I think

389
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:15,244
Speaker 0: what we need people to do is we need to find Because I don't know how to find them and I want to look at them right the other hate sites that are say on cloud Flare still and be like hey cloud where you ever to they change ever to this - yeah Hey get rid of this -

390
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,739
Speaker 1: we're gonna make a slippery slope for Nazis.

391
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:21,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, just and just down at the bottom of the slope is Nazis.

392
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:23,180
Speaker 0: everything else lower on the slope stays.

393
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:28,859
Speaker 1: So bid mitigate which is already like shitty was sold to epic with a K.

394
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,350
Speaker 0: He pik not the not fortnight.

395
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:37,049
Speaker 1: Yeah epic with a K is basically the hosting provider for them.

396
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,638
Speaker 1: all the vile speech on earth at this point like they own all the shitty shit and They own gab.

397
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,624
Speaker 1: Gab is the thing we talked about earlier.

398
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:48,890
Speaker 1: gab is where all the people to vial for Twitter and read it ended up.

399
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,563
Speaker 1: So now we got.

400
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:53,389
Speaker 1: basically we need to go after.

401
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:58,862
Speaker 1: epic as a whole like that company needs to be deplatformed Mm-hmm.

402
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:03,966
Speaker 1: So in some related news Where's the other piece here?

403
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:04,609
Speaker 1: There's.

404
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:06,459
Speaker 1: there's a related thing we can go after.

405
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:15,380
Speaker 0: So it turns out that Breitbart which is vile but not a chain vial It's just one step less vile and bright parts been mostly deplatformed.

406
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,740
Speaker 0: It's also a place I would never go never read and if anyone did read it, I would never speak to them again.

407
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,249
Speaker 0: Bright bar, it's still very very very vile.

408
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,075
Speaker 1: and info wars similarly vile.

409
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:34,562
Speaker 1: very related info wars and bright Bart have been largely deplatformed by a lot of the big providers but a lot of their revenue comes from Advertising.

410
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:37,895
Speaker 0: I thought it comes from selling bullshit and selling bullshit.

411
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:48,446
Speaker 1: Okay turns out Amazon provides the storefront to sell the bullshit and Amazon is actually the one of the largest Advertisers on bright part.

412
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:51,920
Speaker 0: Well, Amazon is one of those people that I don't even know where they're advertising, right?

413
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, literally just type some code into your site and now Amazon's running.

414
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:55,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

415
00:24:56,502 --> 00:25:04,050
Speaker 1: So same as Google I would recommend all of you to direct your rage at Amazon and get them to stop Letting Breitbart be a part of their ad network.

416
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,920
Speaker 0: go protest at your local Whole Foods.

417
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:18,589
Speaker 0: So you got some news, yeah, so You know this always sorts of sort of goes down, you know every once in a while where there's the Apple rumors And then they turn out to be true.

418
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,272
Speaker 0: usually, right?

419
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:32,854
Speaker 0: So If you don't know by now every September used to be when it iPod season because there's back to school and When the iPod died and it became iPhones September is iPhone season.

420
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:34,440
Speaker 0: they announced new iPhones in September.

421
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,426
Speaker 0: They well, they announced the new Iowa.

422
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:37,449
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta back up a little.

00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,116
Speaker 1: voxility cut service to epic comm is all.

424
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:41,220
Speaker 1: epic is down.

425
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:43,432
Speaker 1: Okay, epic bit mitigate.

426
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:44,317
Speaker 0: Anyway, whatever.

427
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:49,072
Speaker 0: so the Apple rumors, right.

428
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:58,447
Speaker 0: so WWDC in the spring ish times is when they announce the new iOS and what features it'll have Which are inevitably gonna be on the new iPhone.

429
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:00,793

Speaker 0: It has been that way for every year since like two that more than ten years.

433
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:14,280
Speaker 0: this way.

434
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:23,454
Speaker 0: It's not a surprise guys every single year as if iPhone one was 2007 It has been September October every year since then.

435
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,280
Speaker 0: do not be surprised by this.

436
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,643
Speaker 0: Don't be like.

437
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:31,214
Speaker 0: go when a new iPhones coming fucking September Never October you can't mess this one up guys.

438
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:36,036
Speaker 0: All right, so And there's always rumors and people are like, you never know.

439
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:43,929
Speaker 0: those rumors can be true But actually as it turns out for the past many years like maybe I don't know 10 fucking years The rumors always turn out to be like 80% true.

440
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:55,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's usually because of things like Leaks at factories Photos of cases because people have to have to get iPhone cases in the store at the same day as the iPhone.

441
00:26:55,902 --> 00:27:01,780
Speaker 0: So they tell these third-party accessory makers what the iPhones are gonna be shaped like and stuff and they make cases in advance.

442
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:10,463
Speaker 0: Right all this stuff comes out day one and even if Apple itself and their developers and their engineers are super tight There are leaks.

443
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:11,185
Speaker 0: I saw a leak.

444
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:16,260
Speaker 0: someone was taking a picture of a Samsung phone and leaking the Samsung phone.

445
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:28,384
Speaker 0: They took a picture of the Samsung phone with the new unreleased iPhone XR equivalent like iPhone XR 2 or whatever and you can see a reflection of the back of that phone in the front of the New Samsung phone.

446
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,110
Speaker 0: Ah, perhaps that was intentional.

447
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,037
Speaker 0: Perhaps that was you know, and it's like.

448
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,505
Speaker 0: I mean That was faked.

449
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:41,170
Speaker 0: But actually in my experience I see things like that every year and it often turns out They're like almost always exactly right.

450
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,340
Speaker 1: Well, plus go all the way back to the famous Teapot for sale, right?

451
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,685
Speaker 0: So the new iPhones.

452
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:56,820
Speaker 0: the biggest thing people are gonna notice visually about them Is that on the back almost all the leaked pictures show a giant square like three cameras like several camera lenses in it.

453
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,827
Speaker 0: We're not we're beyond daddy to lens now.

454
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:02,920
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, since they can't have some mock three, right?

455
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,992
Speaker 0: Well, they can't have a mechanical Zoom that's an optical zoom.

456
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:14,400
Speaker 0: That's actually has a motor that Vertical traversal right that requires moving parts, which they really don't want in a phone, right?

457
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:21,280
Speaker 0: So as a result, we get on phones several lenses and they're still really amazing cameras, but better than most cameras.

458
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,408
Speaker 0: You'll buy separately.

459
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, but still that's the thing.

460
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:30,140
Speaker 0: But the main thing you got to know about iPhones this year is that Apple bought Intel's modem business?

461
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,269
Speaker 0: There was all this crazy.

462
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,579
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot about that.

463
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:42,900
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of crazy shenanigans going on with Apple Qualcomm Modem licensing all these patents for modems right radios and shit, right?

464
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,931
Speaker 0: You can read about that on your own separately.

465
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:48,720
Speaker 0: Just look for like Apple Qualcomm lawsuit modems radios, whatever.

466
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:59,779
Speaker 0: But the only real other major company that made you know modem radios for you know, cell phones is Intel making 5g radios and Intel's like getting out of that business.

467
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:07,312
Speaker 0: So Apple bought part of that business to make their own goddamn radios to try to fuck Qualcomm Putting Qualcomm shit in their phone.

468
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,480
Speaker 0: so they can get away from that nonsense.

469
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:13,457
Speaker 0: Right because pretty much it's Qualcomm is making the only good radios and it's not that no one else could.

470
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:14,380
Speaker 0: it's patents.

471
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:15,774
Speaker 0: Mostly you're locking that one in.

472
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:22,248
Speaker 0: Yeah so The I thinking was that what was gonna happen?

473
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:23,271
Speaker 0: was it next year?

474
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:26,320
Speaker 0: 2021 would be when iPhones all had 5g radios.

475
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,092
Speaker 0: But as it turns out it looks like this year.

476
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,260
Speaker 0: they say they're all gonna have 5g radios in them.

477
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:46,860
Speaker 0: So if you're hankering from a certain five G's and you live in a 5g place maybe you could buy a new iPhone this year, but The other rumor that's probably true is that the iPhones this year aren't really gonna be a big upgrade from the iPhones last year.

478
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,840
Speaker 0: All right, they're not gonna be that different.

479
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:53,117
Speaker 0: So the ones in 2021 are gonna be a huge upgrade.

480
00:29:53,197 --> 00:30:03,880
Speaker 0: most notably You might remember a few years ago Apple really wanted to do the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone But they didn't want to have that button at the bottom of the screen.

481
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:17,460
Speaker 0: So what they did is they removed the button and they couldn't get the fingerprint sensor to work when it was behind the actual Screen, so what they did instead is they put the notch up top with the face unlock Right and the face unlock is okay.

482
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:29,541
Speaker 0: But Apple still really wants the fingerprint sensor behind the screen Because that means they can get rid of the notch and have a phone That is a hundred percent screen on the front and it looks like in 2021.

483
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:36,052
Speaker 1: Now I'm still fine with phones that just put the fingerprint sensor as a swipe on the side But I guess Apple doesn't want you to swipe.

484
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,440
Speaker 0: They want you to just put your finger there.

485
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, like magic that swipe is no good because there's too much user stuff going on.

486
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:43,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not the Apple way.

487
00:30:43,441 --> 00:31:04,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it looks like 2021 is gonna be the iPhone that has Not only fingerprint sensor behind the screen a hundred percent screen on the front of the phone and 5g But also most importantly the rumor is that the iPhone from this year 29 not 2021 2020 20 still 2019 Subtracting

488
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,334
Speaker 1: yourself subtract

489
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:06,180
Speaker 0: a year from all the years.

490
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,930
Speaker 0: I said the 2019 phone will be a minor upgrade.

491
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,994
Speaker 0: 2020 will be a big upgrade.

492
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:18,420
Speaker 0: the 2019 phone despite being all this other stuff is supposedly gonna have all still lightning cables.

493
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:27,820
Speaker 0: And supposedly the 2020 phone the major upgrade might finally go to USB C which we're gonna talk about in real soon.

494
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, so my plan as of now and there is also some talk that they are gonna make small phone because middle sized phone Doesn't sell.

495
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,060
Speaker 0: well people want big voter small phone.

496
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm and this is something most interesting because small phone might come out this year.

497
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:53,918
Speaker 0: But I'll probably wait and I'll get the 2020 small iPhone That's a hundred percent screen to finally replace the iPhone 7 and hold on to that phone for ever.

498
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,989
Speaker 1: if they Actually release a small iPhone that's small enough.

499
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,380
Speaker 1: I'll probably switch when the last of my Xperia compacts dies.

500
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,254
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be that small.

501
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,070
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll see how small it actually is.

502
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, because right now it's not gonna be iPhone 5 small.

503
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,225
Speaker 1: I don't think I still hold in my hand.

504
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:16,540
Speaker 1: the Sony xz1 compact is literally the last small Android phone.

505
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:18,586
Speaker 0: Hey, Amanda, I got the pixel 3a.

506
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,249
Speaker 0: It's way good.

507
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:19,931
Speaker 0: It's not.

508
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:22,700
Speaker 0: it's not as small as that but also not waterproof.

509
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:24,228
Speaker 1: I don't think I think it is.

510
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,514
Speaker 1: Is it fully waterproof?

511
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:26,620
Speaker 1: like take a picture in the pool?

512
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,404
Speaker 0: I don't fucking know.

513
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:28,874
Speaker 1: because this is I don't know.

514
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:33,254
Speaker 0: but the point is If I had to get an Android phone, I would get that phone.

515
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:34,780
Speaker 1: I've you know what I did.

516
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,371
Speaker 0: I wouldn't get Android, you know, my next Android phone is.

517
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:46,437
Speaker 1: I actually own another one of this For the next two or three years at least.

518
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:49,473
Speaker 1: unless they make a small iPhone that'll switch.

519
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:53,980
Speaker 1: because I Have a smartwatch after the pebble died.

520
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:57,812
Speaker 1: There really aren't good Android smartwatches like every sound.

521
00:32:57,873 --> 00:33:01,187
Speaker 0: that Apple watch is the only smartwatch worth of shit I have a lot.

522
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:05,450
Speaker 0: if I was an iOS with Apple watch I would just go back to what I did before of no watch.

523
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of did.

524
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:09,042
Speaker 1: I stopped were in my LG.

525
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:15,683
Speaker 0: Apple watch is the only smartwatch worth of shit except since pebble died and the Apple I watch still Wallets great.

526
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:21,996
Speaker 1: It has still like very deep flaws like what a battery doesn't just last two weeks Last a whole day.

527
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:26,260
Speaker 0: Yeah More than a day unless you do something stupid like run Strava directly on it.

528
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:27,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

529
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:34,898
Speaker 0: in which case like for example I use Strava on my watch and I went to summer streets and I biked around for several hours and came home.

530
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:35,340
Speaker 0: and the what?

531
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,618
Speaker 0: I brought no phone with me.

532
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:44,347
Speaker 0: The watch was doing all the GPS all the Strava all the upload all and if you're not aware of this out there GPS like to actually do.

533
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:46,334
Speaker 1: GPS takes a ton of power right?

534
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:49,729
Speaker 0: my watch has LTE in it So it was a phone at the same.

535
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:56,011
Speaker 0: it was a phone and when I got home 40% battery left after several hours and a tiny watch.

536
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:59,240
Speaker 0: that's pretty fucking good with the color screen and all the stuff it does.

537
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:00,126
Speaker 0: Right.

538
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:02,060
Speaker 0: can't complain about the battery life in the Apple.

539
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,870
Speaker 0: I yep, so charge it when you sleep and you.

540
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:04,454
Speaker 0: I've never had it.

541
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:05,480
Speaker 0: I've never had it run out ever.

542
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:12,420
Speaker 1: So supposedly the next round of fossil Android wear watches for their fossil.

543
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,690
Speaker 0: I guess they'll be stylish at least.

544
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:23,487
Speaker 1: the might also be expensive Yeah, but they will have battery lives that are up to five or six days Depending it's all rumors.

545
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,480
Speaker 0: We don't see how much is it gonna do though?

546
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,379
Speaker 0: One Strava directly on it doesn't have LTE like a phone.

547
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:40,440
Speaker 0: Is it like it's not doing all the stuff Apple watches do and then you can't really directly compare that battery life, you know It's like pebble lasted battery life forever because it didn't have the kind of you know, oh, you know fancy screen

548
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:44,795
Speaker 1: Me the most that that the pebble style screen

549
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,440
Speaker 0: didn't have the features that Apple watch I

550
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,360
Speaker 1: think is still the an appropriate screen.

551
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,263
Speaker 1: I agree for for a while.

552
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:59,520
Speaker 1: buy an Apple watch with that kind of screen and all other features the same because you don't need a watch to Do that much and frankly most of the fancy features people are trying to make watches do.

553
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:02,552
Speaker 1: They're not that good at because it's not really the right form factor.

554
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:06,599
Speaker 0: Well, it is Depending on which feet which feature you're talking about?

555
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:15,989
Speaker 1: Well true, but I I think the most useful features of a watch are just getting notifications Apple wedding timers The Apple watch getting directions while you're traveling somewhere.

556
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:20,324
Speaker 0: Apple watch does way way way more than the pebble watch does way better than it Ever did.

557
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,080
Speaker 0: so you're you know, it's what you're paying.

558
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,720
Speaker 0: You're paying the money and the battery life in exchange for the power.

559
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:35,175
Speaker 1: So what I'm waiting to see is of all I've been watching the Android watch space for a while and they're all kind of garbage Right, and this is the first time I've seen an Android that might not be garbage.

560
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think my feeling is if you know if you're not Apple with I with an Apple watch, right?

561
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,650
Speaker 1: Just get a fit and only know it for fitting.

562
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,760
Speaker 0: get either no watch at all.

563
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:48,653
Speaker 0: I just look at your phone like I did for years.

564
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:56,800
Speaker 0: It was fine or Get just the cheap, but you know the Casio the regular cat the LG style no fairly works.

565
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:57,965
Speaker 1: It's like 80 bucks.

566
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:58,387
Speaker 1: now.

567
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:01,460
Speaker 0: today just get the regular Casio digital watch.

568
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,971
Speaker 0: That's just a watch and a stopwatch and doesn't?

569
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:09,240
Speaker 0: it is just no normal ass watch for $5 But there's no doesn't do any smart anything.

570
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:11,991
Speaker 1: I would never want a watch that tell the telling.

571
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:13,598
Speaker 1: the time is not what I use a watch for.

572
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,545
Speaker 0: no But the all it saves you though It's like you remember.

573
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:19,100
Speaker 0: the goal is to not have to take your phone out of your pocket, right?

574
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,999
Speaker 0: So half the time I take my phone in my pocket is to see Notifications and half the time I take it into my pocket is to see what time it is.

575
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:33,614
Speaker 0: So if I couldn't get a good watch for notifications like an Apple watch at least I could get the cheapo Casio Digital watch and reduce half the time.

576
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:34,600
Speaker 0: I take my phone out of my pot.

577
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,965
Speaker 0: I've always kind of hate for like $10.

578
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:42,740
Speaker 1: in the old before there were smartwatches or smartphones or cell phones I hated the idea of wearing a watch.

579
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:48,720
Speaker 0: I preferred pocket watches for the sole reason that so that you could say so you could be that person who has a pocket.

580
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:49,908
Speaker 1: No, it was specifically.

581
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:57,080
Speaker 1: I had this very particular philosophy I need to be able to know what time it is, but I don't want to constantly know what time it is.

582
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,107
Speaker 0: Don't fucking look at your watch.

583
00:36:58,368 --> 00:36:59,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's right there.

584
00:36:59,173 --> 00:36:59,838
Speaker 1: You might just see it.

585
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,260
Speaker 0: My Apple watch is blank unless I look at it.

586
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, my watch is also blank until I'd like shake it and look at it or I get a notification.

587
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:22,700
Speaker 0: the point is anyway, this might be the first like almost usable baby's first Android smartwatch that isn't garbage since the pebble and anyone who like You know has like a Rolex and it wasn't just like the only one you have and it was grandpa's or something.

588
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:24,556
Speaker 0: Yeah get in line for the guillotine.

589
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:36,440
Speaker 1: But anyway, it looks like it's time for things of the day.

590
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,491
Speaker 0: What the fuck was my thing of the day?

591
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:39,599
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember now.

592
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:43,120
Speaker 0: Yeah So Gen Con just happened and we are not fans of Gen Con.

593
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,301
Speaker 0: Gen

594
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:47,338
Speaker 1: Con is poorly run and I would never attend it as a guest unless they change a lot of their policies

595
00:37:47,378 --> 00:38:02,319
Speaker 0: despite I mean Gen Con has good policies and bad policies But despite the convention organization itself and the things that they do wrong Good people go to Gen Con and good games happen there and there are Positives to going there that have nothing to do with the con.

596
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:07,140
Speaker 0: I mean if you get some of the you know There's like really good stuff happening because good people are there playing good games, right?

597
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:19,201
Speaker 0: And that's not Gen Con's fault nor you know, or nor will I hold it against them anyway, so Because of that there are lots and lots of gaming tweets coming from Gen Con and I was getting a lot of good stuff for Those.

598
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:23,573
Speaker 1: Lord I have the issue of Dragon magazine where you're thinking of the day was reviewed.

Speaker 0: That's right.

601
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:37,780
Speaker 0: So One thing I discovered that I did not know existed before thanks to Some you know tweets from Gen Con is I would have saved this for Tuesday, but it's too good.

626
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:00,250
Speaker 0: Basically, the rules are so loose and sparse.

627
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,535
Speaker 0: It barely qualifies.

628
00:40:01,555 --> 00:40:02,980
Speaker 0: That's what it says in Wikipedia.

629
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:09,520

668
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:41,880
Speaker 1: So my thing today is real brief.

669
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,970
Speaker 1: I didn't want to use a cuz.

670
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:52,360
Speaker 1: lately a lot of our things that they have been tweets Or very short YouTube videos things of the day are finding are hard to come by in a dark world.

671
00:41:52,824 --> 00:42:00,542
Speaker 1: Yep Also, we've set the bar a little high in the sense that things that might have been like good enough to be a thing of The day back in 2010

672
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:04,019
Speaker 0: I raised the bar with my good things of the day and then you were embarrassed with your bad things of the day.

673
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:04,763
Speaker 0: now You're trying to.

674
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:05,749
Speaker 0: you know, I'd love to see.

675
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,398
Speaker 1: we still need to do the thing of the day off.

676
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:08,527
Speaker 0: I think they are.

677
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:09,071
Speaker 1: we just need to.

678
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,260
Speaker 0: you cannot win the thing.

679
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:16,800
Speaker 1: We need to bring our top ten things of the day of all time and get the listener Things of the day that we've already used as things of the day.

680
00:42:16,822 --> 00:42:19,480
Speaker 1: Yeah You go back and we each bring to the table.

681
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:28,991
Speaker 1: Well We think our own personal 10 best and we let the listener decide which one of us based on that set of 20 Truly is the king of the things of the day.

682
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:31,160
Speaker 1: All right, that'll be a fun show to do someday.

683
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:36,200
Speaker 1: But so this is an article from a blog of going medieval that I read occasionally.

684
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,520
Speaker 1: I bump into it every now and then and it's just like fun explorations of how you don't know shit about the Middle Ages.

685
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:46,372
Speaker 0: No, cuz it was dark and there wasn't a lot of recorded history.

686
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,700
Speaker 1: No, no, it's actually there's a lot of recorded history.

687
00:42:49,041 --> 00:43:00,320
Speaker 1: But most people just when they imagine the word like medieval times a castle and peasants They imagine shit covered peasants like marching to war against other shit covered peasants.

688
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:06,200
Speaker 1: Well Knights on horses ride behind them and take a all those castles and crap.

689
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:17,160
Speaker 1: But a common misconception of the medieval time watery tarts flinging swords And the Middle Ages is that people didn't bathe and this is a pretty direct explanation of it.

690
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:23,140
Speaker 1: Not only did medieval people bathe, but they fucking loved taking baths.

691
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:24,865
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz everything's so fucking filthy.

692
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:34,864
Speaker 0: you will take in a bath and it goes in if you get all slimy and sweaty After a whole weekend of biking and the shower truck broke down when you get home and shower Baby.

693
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,660
Speaker 0: so you worked in the fields all day.

694
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:41,072
Speaker 0: Yeah You know harvesting whatever the fuck potatoes for some night.

695
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,060
Speaker 0: who had a castle that protected you?

696
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:51,894
Speaker 0: No, the night nobleman swerve and you finally get some free time with your family And there's like a is a pond and you can go in that pond and babe.

697
00:43:52,596 --> 00:44:02,760
Speaker 1: It's like the best Peasant coming through like you can even tell yep But not only could meet evil bathe but the point the meta point this article makes is great.

698
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:04,708
Speaker 0: Rome came first in.

699
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:05,554
Speaker 0: Rome had bathhouse.

700
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:06,580
Speaker 0: They had bathing technology.

701
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:09,668
Speaker 1: But you asked the average person like who is dirtier?

702
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:13,599
Speaker 1: the Roman like people constantly talk about how medieval people dirty.

703
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:21,672
Speaker 1: in Rome You had bath houses, but this article points out Romans bathed primarily with oil and did not have modern soap.

704
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,738
Speaker 1: fucking medieval people invented soap.

705
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:24,320
Speaker 0: That's right.

706
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,247
Speaker 1: So this article is pretty good.

707
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:27,733
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean a lot of.

708
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:28,194
Speaker 0: today.

709
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:29,540
Speaker 0: a lot of people are using oil for soap.

710
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, good use soap or soap with oil in it, which is fine do not the?

711
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:45,095
Speaker 1: Depending on the era of Rome and those times a common way to bathe was to basically Douse yourself in olive oil and then scrape it off with a shell or a stick.

712
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:48,146
Speaker 0: That is pretty good It's okay feels good though.

713
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:49,572
Speaker 1: It does not de-stinkify.

714
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:51,820
Speaker 0: However, but how it makes you smell like olive.

715
00:44:53,082 --> 00:45:08,416
Speaker 1: But oh, I can't find there's a link from this article To tell why I like this blog that gets into the history of nofap November and why it is mostly Promoted by vile people, okay It's surprisingly related to the concept of medieval bathing.

716
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:09,180
Speaker 0: interesting.

717
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:13,071
Speaker 1: Yeah In the meta moment the econized book a book is the first novel.

718
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:18,800
Speaker 0: the tale of Genji the first novel ever Written by humans ever is still available for you to read.

719
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:21,413
Speaker 0: So why wouldn't you read it before reading any other novel?

720
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:22,418
Speaker 0: you gonna start with volume one?

721
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:29,360
Speaker 1: Yep We'll be live at PAX West 2019 with two panels one of which if you've seen it before neither of which got cancelled.

722
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,092
Speaker 1: We we We have our flaws yet.

723
00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:35,140
Speaker 1: We have our flaws.

724
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:39,937
Speaker 1: We could get kids but we are above the line of being banned from packs for being shitty.

725
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:40,419
Speaker 0: Thank God.

726
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:44,430
Speaker 1: So on Friday and Saturday, you can see us.

727
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,300
Speaker 1: live and stay tuned because we're already making our plans.

728
00:45:47,601 --> 00:45:49,348
Speaker 1: Pax south badges went on sale.

729
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:50,814
Speaker 1: We will definitely be there.

730
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:52,280
Speaker 1: packs unplugged is coming up.

731
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,162
Speaker 1: We will be there.

732
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:56,974
Speaker 1: pack season begins as soon as summer ends and we will be there.

733
00:45:57,275 --> 00:45:59,200
Speaker 0: Beach Beach Beach Beach Beach Beach Beach packs.

734
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:11,538
Speaker 0: That's my life, yep, my life is the same except in the After after bike Beach bike beat by beach starting packs hockey starting.

735
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:16,000
Speaker 1: after packs You throw a ski in there ski ski ski mixed in with hockey and packs.

736
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,407
Speaker 0: That's that's the life everybody.

737
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:21,139
Speaker 1: I feel like we need to add one mid like one winter beach.

738
00:46:22,302 --> 00:46:23,895
Speaker 0: Why don't we just add some Civil War in there?

739
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:26,030
Speaker 1: As in start a civil war.

740
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:36,126
Speaker 1: Well, I mean finish it As flip as that comment was.

741
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:40,300
Speaker 1: it is far too important and real and serious and I actually do agree.

742
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:42,499
Speaker 1: But let's get into the main bit.

743
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:49,320
Speaker 1: So we are not going to get into the deep technical specifications of USB because we don't fucking know.

744
00:46:49,360 --> 00:47:01,806
Speaker 1: that's why and I'm gonna say I know a lot about all USB both the cabling standards the signaling standards everything up until USB to USB 3.

745
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,675
Speaker 1: I know enough because it matters.

746
00:47:04,077 --> 00:47:08,820
Speaker 1: and now USB is at the point to where you don't need to know unless you work in the hardware.

747
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:13,677
Speaker 0: We did do an episode before about USB in general, but USB C wasn't a thing then.

748
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,560
Speaker 0: so let me set you straight.

749
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,827
Speaker 0: Just real summary right now.

750
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:17,919
Speaker 0: There's two different things to got to worry about.

751
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:23,056
Speaker 0: There's USB ABC letters and there's USB 1 2 3 numbers.

752
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:25,262
Speaker 0: They are Disconnected.

753
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:30,517
Speaker 0: you could have USB A and B cable right with a on one and B on the other.

754
00:47:30,537 --> 00:47:31,941
Speaker 0: that's talking about the shape of The cable.

755
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,368
Speaker 1: well that's talking about the shape and the wires.

756
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:37,397
Speaker 1: answer right and you can have a to a.

757
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:43,233
Speaker 0: yes Yes, micro a to me doing the summary not the details.

758
00:47:43,273 --> 00:47:44,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't.

759
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,640
Speaker 0: letters are about the cable.

760
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,824
Speaker 0: What does the cable look like?

761
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:47,708
Speaker 0: where does it plug into?

762
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:48,752
Speaker 0: what wires are inside?

763
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,900
Speaker 0: right the numbers are about?

764
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,826
Speaker 0: What's going over the cable?

765
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:56,560
Speaker 0: right if it's a USB 1 cable that ain't doing shit for you in 2019?

766
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:05,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, a USB 2 cable is carrying USB 2 speeds with USB 2 devices Right USB 3 with the blue inside to let you know that you can plug in.

767
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:15,681
Speaker 1: you know your high speed devices on that line Even though a fun fact almost every device you use is using USB 2 even if it's on a 3 almost everything is still using 2.

768
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:18,570
Speaker 0: so USB C is a new cable shape.

769
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,660
Speaker 0: you've probably seen it cuz it's really advancing quite quickly.

770
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:25,393
Speaker 0: You know most desktop motherboards these days have at least one or two on there.

771
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:27,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, new MacBooks only have them.

772
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,510
Speaker 0: They just got two on each side.

773
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,034
Speaker 0: That's it.

774
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:34,353
Speaker 1: Yeah Nintendo my computer which I built a while ago already has one USB C on the back.

775
00:48:34,374 --> 00:48:36,279
Speaker 0: Nintendo Switch has one on the bottom.

776
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,380
Speaker 0: most Newphones that aren't Apple phones with lightning had all this to have them on the bottom.

777
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,885
Speaker 1: I love always does this.

778
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:43,370
Speaker 0: we're gonna do a cable.

779
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,237
Speaker 0: new iPads have it on the bottom.

780
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:45,819
Speaker 0: right.

781
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:48,689
Speaker 0: apples Put it on everything except for iPhones which have lightning.

782
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,472
Speaker 0: everything else.

783
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,780
Speaker 0: everything else at Apple has USB C now.

784
00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:53,648
Speaker 0: So it's a different cable shape.

785
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,160
Speaker 0: It looks like sort of like a hamburger patty.

786
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:59,634
Speaker 0: It's just flat on the top and bottom and round on the sides.

787
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:00,820
Speaker 1: I guess I can see that.

788
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,513
Speaker 1: That's not how I would have described.

789
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:06,540
Speaker 0: you describe it I don't know a cylinder that got hammered from both sides.

790
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:10,091
Speaker 1: I guess I would just describe it as a pancake.

791
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:12,800
Speaker 1: Oh, I know a wide oval wide oval.

792
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,939
Speaker 0: It's flat on top and bottom and runs on a blade shape anyway.

793
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:19,329
Speaker 0: It's the best part about it is it goes in both ways.

794
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,906
Speaker 0: yep swings both ways everybody because no more Four-dimensional USB cables.

795
00:49:24,947 --> 00:49:25,990
Speaker 0: you put it in it doesn't go.

796
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,331
Speaker 1: I don't have to take off my belt anymore to explain Turn it around it doesn't go.

797
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:31,760
Speaker 0: you turn it around a third time now.

798
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,786
Speaker 0: If it's no you see just goes in.

799
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:35,852
Speaker 0: it goes in very quite securely.

800
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:41,360
Speaker 0: like I can put a USB C cable in and like swing My phone around a little bit and be not my phone.

801
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,124
Speaker 0: But you know get.

802
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:45,320
Speaker 0: you can swing a device around and be kind of confident.

803
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,418
Speaker 0: It's not gonna like become detached and fall off unless you know you it's pretty secure connection there right.

804
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:58,994
Speaker 1: yep Here's the other very important thing about it Micro USB which up until recently has been the standard.

805
00:49:59,014 --> 00:49:59,115
Speaker 1: like.

806
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:09,133
Speaker 1: the only things that use mini USB are Old old old thing or cheap things or a full-size USB b-side Shitty old printers and scanners.

807
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:10,280
Speaker 1: pretty much it yeah.

808
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,674
Speaker 0: But micro USB is what a lot of phones were using before USB C and my old devices.

809
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,840
Speaker 1: extremely good for the time.

810
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,331
Speaker 1: But it had one very and only goes in one way which?

811
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:24,200
Speaker 0: but it was fine because I was a real cheap and flimsy.

812
00:50:24,823 --> 00:50:26,290
Speaker 1: I would know that actually that's not.

813
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:28,500
Speaker 1: it was not flimsy nor was it cheap.

814
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,337
Speaker 1: That was the problem because the USB micro connector has moving parts.

815
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:40,380
Speaker 1: it requires these Springs and these little teeth to make it work and those are great, but that means those cables wear out.

816
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,220
Speaker 0: Yeah They're not great.

817
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:46,900
Speaker 1: There was a time a few years ago where like a lot of people all at once started randomly complaining about like cables breaking.

818
00:50:47,262 --> 00:50:50,480
Speaker 1: That's just because those cables have a limited number of insertions before they fail.

819
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,767
Speaker 0: And why do we even need micro and mini USB?

820
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:54,593
Speaker 0: because regular USB was too big.

821
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:57,764
Speaker 0: think about a regular USB cable for your computer Like that your mouse has.

822
00:50:57,784 --> 00:51:00,234
Speaker 0: hey you have a phone with that kind of pole on.

823
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:01,600
Speaker 0: it's an enormous fucking phone.

824
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,760
Speaker 1: It was that's the a-side the b-side of full-size USB that goes in your scanner.

825
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:09,191
Speaker 1: It's a square that is literally thicker than my thick ass.

826
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:09,953
Speaker 1: Android phone.

827
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:10,274
Speaker 0: right.

828
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,819
Speaker 0: so the best thing.

829
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,620
Speaker 0: another thing My USB C. Is that it's so small.

830
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:18,523
Speaker 0: We you can use it on desktop Phone.

831
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,733
Speaker 0: we don't need big and small.

832
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:22,140
Speaker 0: It's just one size.

833
00:51:22,322 --> 00:51:23,072
Speaker 0: It's small enough.

834
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:34,451
Speaker 0: already every device whether it's a giant desktop or a TV or a tiny phone or like a headphone that needs to be recharged can All just use normal USB C. We don't need a micro version.

835
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:38,745
Speaker 1: so here are the other two important things about the physicality Point number one it.

836
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:42,580
Speaker 1: the two sides the cable are also the same.

837
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:53,088
Speaker 0: You don't need an a-side and a b-side you can just use either side for a or B. So if you when we have printers and scanners and all these things finally switch to USB C You won't need to get some weird cable.

838
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:56,300
Speaker 0: That's like as a big one on one side or anything like that.

839
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,337
Speaker 0: You'll just every cable will just be the same USB C thing on both fucking sides.

840
00:52:01,678 --> 00:52:02,300
Speaker 0: end of story.

841
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:03,765
Speaker 0: No more muss and fuss.

842
00:52:04,006 --> 00:52:07,780
Speaker 1: now there are a side and b-side pin layouts.

843
00:52:08,223 --> 00:52:10,620
Speaker 1: But you don't need to worry about that.

844
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, the devices will just figure out like oh, I'm on the a-side perp.

845
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:15,559
Speaker 0: I'm on the b-side perp.

846
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:18,639
Speaker 1: Yep Because the cables have a bunch of pins.

847
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:23,700
Speaker 1: The pins are all shielded and wired in such a way to where they can do the things they're intended for.

848
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,300
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into why you twist cables and why you have cable pairs.

849
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:30,680
Speaker 1: We talked about that in the episode we did about ethernet a long long time.

850
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that USB C has so many wires in it.

851
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,520
Speaker 0: It has so many features on those wires and it can reuse the different wires for different things based on what's going on.

852
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:39,423
Speaker 1: Here's some examples.

853
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:41,913
Speaker 1: You can just put DisplayPort like over USB C.

854
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:43,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need DisplayPort cables.

855
00:52:43,781 --> 00:52:51,218
Speaker 0: There's no reason you couldn't just make a computer that has only USB C in the back and like nothing else like the.

856
00:52:51,258 --> 00:52:56,240
Speaker 0: instead of a HDMI and DisplayPort output just a USB C and you plug a cable into your monitor.

857
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,234
Speaker 0: There you go, but the video signals going over the USB C cable Thunderbolt fine, whatever.

858
00:53:01,254 --> 00:53:03,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a log audio.

859
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:11,160
Speaker 1: It'll actually just use the USB 2 pairs because it has some pins that are just to be used for USB 2 support.

860
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually use that.

861
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:17,008
Speaker 0: so like my for example, my iPad has USB C on the bottom and this is Apple No headphone jack.

862
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:25,788
Speaker 0: There's a little adapter you can get from Apple but you can get a third-party one as USB C on one end and headphone hole on the other end and It's not some special thing.

863
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:26,974
Speaker 0: It doesn't really need a chip.

864
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:28,300
Speaker 0: the iPad just knows.

865
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:38,407
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a headphone being plugged in and over those wires It sends ground, you know left audio channel right audio channel And then the microphone one on the.

866
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:40,817
Speaker 0: you know, cuz TRS right tip ring ring sleeve.

867
00:53:40,857 --> 00:53:42,683
Speaker 0: That's four things Yep, four pins.

868
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:48,080
Speaker 0: So and then it just it's this analog audio coming out of the digital USB C hole.

869
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:52,278
Speaker 0: That's normally digital and then it goes right into your normal analog headphones.

870
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:52,700
Speaker 0: And there you go.

871
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,580
Speaker 0: You're listening to music with a headphone jack, even though it's plugged into USB C hole.

872
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,048
Speaker 0: You could actually have a computer.

873
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:01,235
Speaker 0: your desktop could go without sound card.

874
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,599
Speaker 0: theoretically, right?

875
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,800
Speaker 0: It would just need a digital analog converter and you could plug headphones into the USB C hole on your computer.

876
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,859
Speaker 0: Theoretically if someone made that work with the right drivers and shit.

877
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,527
Speaker 1: Yep so a step back a little bit.

878
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:21,468
Speaker 1: USB stands for universal serial bus because in the old days the idea was Get a million different cables like the ps2.

879
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,640
Speaker 0: There was a lot of parallel ones, which is why you need serial ones.

880
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:29,420
Speaker 0: They refer to our USB episode and skip this entire section of rim reiterating it

881
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:38,928
Speaker 1: No, no, but the point I want to get at is that While you every time USB could have been the one connector and cable to rule them all there were always these niche use cases.

882
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:44,045
Speaker 1: like you old USB you couldn't send like Streaming data over it.

883
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,490
Speaker 0: It wasn't fast enough.

884
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,800
Speaker 1: It wasn't fast enough didn't have enough cables and it wasn't real time.

885
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, so bit by bit.

886
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:54,980
Speaker 1: you always needed USB could cover a lot of cases But you still needed firewire.

887
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:03,720
Speaker 0: It was just for like mice keyboard 56k external motors external USB sticks without a really slow.

888
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:12,640
Speaker 0: It's like as time went on they made them faster without changing the connector and then more and more use cases came up where it's like Oh, you can have external stuff now doing this.

889
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:25,892
Speaker 1: yep, but along the way material science got better and we started needing a DC power plug standard because almost every device you use Uses DC and AC is what comes out of the holes.

890
00:55:26,113 --> 00:55:26,876
Speaker 1: Yeah in your house.

891
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:30,970
Speaker 0: Yep in America Yeah, and most of the world pretty much everywhere.

892
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,419
Speaker 1: No nowhere has just DC to the house.

893
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:38,200
Speaker 0: I mean, oh, there's some signs and there are some places where like they have DC power lined up.

894
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:41,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, like in data centers on boss bar.

895
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, that kind of stuff.

896
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:42,633
Speaker 0: Yeah.

897
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:43,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd not in your house.

898
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:44,680
Speaker 0: Someone's house.

899
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,125
Speaker 1: No, someone's house.

900
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,880
Speaker 1: miss some horrible nerd who's probably there's probably a burnt skeleton.

901
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,508
Speaker 0: I'm googling house with DC power.

902
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,634
Speaker 1: I've seen nerds try to make stuff like that.

903
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:55,456
Speaker 1: It's not a good idea.

904
00:55:55,476 --> 00:55:58,106
Speaker 1: Someone's ass, but We're fine.

905
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:01,680
Speaker 1: now that USB sort of became the powering standard.

906
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:07,421
Speaker 1: We're very close to the point with USB C where we literally will have one cable to rule them All.

907
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:11,820
Speaker 1: the only cable we need to destroy is the lightning cable.

908
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:14,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, because lightning can just go over USB C cable, right?

909
00:56:15,521 --> 00:56:23,620
Speaker 0: The only thing that's using lightning cables is iPhones And some things and some peripherals that early adopters mistakenly bought.

910
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,995
Speaker 0: Well, there are some iPhone accessories that use lightning like.

911
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:26,860
Speaker 0: I think there's like beats.

912
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:31,518
Speaker 0: I had beats headphones once and you had to recharge them with lightning because they they were meant to be used.

913
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:32,060
Speaker 0: with the iPhones.

914
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,910
Speaker 0: They're like, oh you got an iPhone you got.

915
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,378
Speaker 0: use lightning to charge this headphone to.

916
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:37,624
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

917
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,540
Speaker 0: Yeah USB C is finally one cable one shape.

918
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:52,275
Speaker 0: You can run anything over the cable you can run, you know your mouse keyboard your phone You're just plug your monitor in high back plug your cam.

919
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:53,359
Speaker 0: all my can't like cameras.

920
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:56,839
Speaker 0: now I'll have USB C to transfer a 4k video off the camera.

921
00:56:57,101 --> 00:57:01,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could live stream video over it's if you depending on what protocol you're using.

922
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:11,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, and because the one cable you can use so many protocols even though it's USB C You could use USB 2.0 over USB C USB 3.0 USB 3.2 Thunderbolt.

923
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:23,824
Speaker 1: second We're not gonna go long on this but a part of the value of the USB C cable is that it supports USB 3.1 which is Really fast.

924
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:28,980
Speaker 0: There are USB 3.1 that you could use with the old USB 3.0 blue A/B cable

925
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:29,722
Speaker 1: But

926
00:57:30,164 --> 00:57:45,188
Speaker 0: you can get USB 3.2 like mega speeds over USB C cables like insane speeds like several gigabits at the point and that's actually a huge difference because Up until now the fastest thing you could really plug into your computer.

927
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:48,316
Speaker 0: That wasn't internal was like something like eSATA.

928
00:57:48,376 --> 00:57:52,735
Speaker 0: maybe right or You know net your network would be one gigabit.

929
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,134
Speaker 1: My last computer had a bunch of eSATA cables and did.

930
00:57:56,174 --> 00:57:57,420
Speaker 1: those were not commonly right?

931
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,019
Speaker 1: He said is killed by USB C because he said like SATA is not a resilient protocol for a long cable to connect to.

932
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,904
Speaker 0: no No, but now it's like well if I got a NAS Why would I plug?

933
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:10,880
Speaker 0: if I got you know external hard drives right in a NAS in a raid?

934
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,680
Speaker 0: Why would I connect them over the network at one gigabit onto my network?

935
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:22,348
Speaker 0: When I could just plug them in directly to my computer with USB C yep, that's way faster than one gigabit.

936
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:27,346
Speaker 0: and then it used the network sharing on my computer if I wanted other computers than the Network to be able to access the.

937
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:29,360
Speaker 1: we talked about this back when we were doing the NAS job.

938
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,740
Speaker 1: They're due to the NAS and a DAS network tech sort attached storage versus disk attached storage or direct attached storage.

939
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:46,700
Speaker 1: But if you're like using a workstation to edit like giant 8k videos Yeah You plug a giant sand directly into that computer instead of having hard drives in the computer.

940
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:50,900
Speaker 0: So the final thing that I want to say about USB C that's so great having this one cable.

941
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,797
Speaker 0: Is that all of the things around the cable are?

942
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:58,773
Speaker 0: Super super standardized to even right now more than you would realize.

943
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:11,080
Speaker 0: for example, I bought a little thing yeah, and on one end of it was USB C and on the other end was Female USB C so that you could get some charging power to whatever device you were playing this into right?

944
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,126
Speaker 0: USB 3 B the square shape.

945
00:59:14,668 --> 00:59:18,800
Speaker 0: so that's like a little hub in case you wanted to plug something else in and an HDMI port.

946
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:23,540
Speaker 0: So what you would use this for would be you would plug the USB C end into your iPad.

947
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:27,320
Speaker 0: You would then connect another USB C cable to keep your iPad charging.

948
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:34,479
Speaker 0: You could then maybe plug in like a USB mouse or keyboard into your iPad or something like that on the USB C You know B hole, right?

949
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:39,534
Speaker 0: and Then you can plug in HDMI cable to get HDMI output from the iPad.

950
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:47,160
Speaker 0: and now you're using like your iPad Connected to an external monitor or a TV or you're streaming what it's showing on your iPad or something like that.

951
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,441
Speaker 0: Now the

952
00:59:47,502 --> 01:00:04,300
Speaker 1: original USB spec the old one handled this kinda yeah, but it was called USB on the go and because of the direction of the cables and everything the end result was if You weren't extremely careful about what you plugged in and how you plugged it in stuff would just get fried.

953
01:00:04,421 --> 01:00:07,480
Speaker 0: But anyway, I bought this little adapter like about 15 bucks.

954
01:00:07,782 --> 01:00:09,372
Speaker 0: Oh, and it lets me do all that stuff.

955
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:10,540
Speaker 0: plug into the bottom of the iPad.

956
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:18,514
Speaker 0: I also have a Nintendo switch and sometimes you don't want to carry your switch dock around with you But I take the same exact adapter.

957
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:19,920
Speaker 0: I didn't buy another different adapter.

958
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:29,686
Speaker 0: I plug the USB C into the bottom of the Nintendo switch and then I can plug my you know use actually to charge a Switch pro controller.

959
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:33,260
Speaker 0: the cable they give you is USB B on one end and C on the other end.

960
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, you plug that in and you can now charge your Nintendo A on one ends not B.

961
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:43,099
Speaker 1: Nothing uses a and it doesn't use this B anymore.

962
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:46,152
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's the rights of the regular old rectangle.

963
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:47,359
Speaker 0: That's a that's the a1.

964
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:48,646
Speaker 0: It was the big one.

965
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,340
Speaker 1: a is the big normal one anyway.

966
01:00:53,030 --> 01:01:00,480
Speaker 0: so Then you plug an HDMI cable to get the video out from your switch to your TV Because you don't want to carry a switch dock, right?

967
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:07,640
Speaker 0: The only thing is the switch itself is just annoying and that the switches has a special program.

968
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:18,839
Speaker 0: It's looking specifically for the official legitimate made by Nintendo AC adapter Which is literally just two prongs that go in the wall and USB C on the other end.

969
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:32,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you have to bring your you as your official Nintendo AC adapter with you But you plug that USB C and into this adapter to charge your switch while the HDMI is coming out and lo and behold The switch will.

970
01:01:32,086 --> 01:01:33,149
Speaker 0: now happily doesn't?

971
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,079
Speaker 0: it will think that that thing is basically your Nintendo switch dock.

972
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:38,568
Speaker 0: Nintendo switch docks cost a fortune.

973
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:41,980
Speaker 0: this thing costs like 15 20 bucks now and it works with my iPad.

974
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:46,833
Speaker 0: Also, it's the same standard USB C to HDMI the same exact everything and

975
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:54,543
Speaker 1: if you're not trying to play video out of it And use it while you're charged like if you just want to charge it any old like the same thing that charges my phone charges The switch.

976
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

977
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,560
Speaker 0: you can actually charge other things with the switch.

978
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:02,620
Speaker 1: I charged my switch from the the anchor battery I carry with myself.

979
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,700
Speaker 0: Yes, it's only when you want your switch to do video out that it demands the official AC adapter.

980
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:08,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, you.

981
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:15,860
Speaker 0: otherwise you could just take like your Samsung phone charger That's USB C and plug it into the bottom Nintendo switch and it charges just fine.

982
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:18,980
Speaker 0: It's like USB C. is that standardized across?

983
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:26,932
Speaker 0: iPad Samsung phone and tend to switch any other thing USB C. You will be shocked at how compatible and how feature right.

984
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,540
Speaker 0: a MacBook Pro has USB C on the side.

985
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,760
Speaker 0: You can take the charger for that shove it in the bottom Nintendo switch charging.

986
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:33,382
Speaker 0: It's working

987
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:44,780
Speaker 1: and it's because that all the people involved have done and all the standards bodies and all the manufacturers have done a lot of work to make USB C Just work without you having to know with all the old USB and all the other cables up at this point.

988
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:48,000
Speaker 1: You had to know things to make weird stuff happen.

989
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:53,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna be shocked if soon as you get more and more USB C stuff You're gonna want to throw away every key.

990
01:02:53,411 --> 01:02:55,323
Speaker 0: everything you have is not USB C.

991
01:02:55,363 --> 01:02:56,472
Speaker 1: example DisplayPort.

992
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:57,500
Speaker 1: fuck those cables.

993
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:02,560
Speaker 1: Remember, those are the cables that will literally ruin your video card or monitor if they're made wrong.

994
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,908
Speaker 1: And most of them are made wrong.

995
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:04,249
Speaker 1: Yep.

996
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:06,060
Speaker 1: The cable itself is a danger.

997
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,066
Speaker 1: USB-c you're pretty much good.

998
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:12,976
Speaker 1: However, only by name-brand USB cables and HDMI.

999
01:03:13,036 --> 01:03:14,500
Speaker 0: It's like one HDMI cable.

1000
01:03:14,882 --> 01:03:16,388
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, not great.

1001
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:22,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually when you start getting into super high-res Situations USB C. It's like boom.

1002
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:24,577
Speaker 0: Let me see that 4k 8k video wall.

1003
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:26,182
Speaker 0: Let's go Yep.

1004
01:03:26,664 --> 01:03:32,730
Speaker 1: Now there is a little nuance to the cables that I don't really want to get into Know.

1005
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:33,339
Speaker 0: it now.

1006
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,358
Speaker 0: Someone else can read it.

1007
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:43,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, I need to read it for them, but it comes down to the fact that the cables have chips in them.

1008
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:49,480
Speaker 1: now Yep, which if you open up like any converter display stuff, there is a lot of logic in cable.

1009
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:49,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's thing.

1010
01:03:50,023 --> 01:03:50,927
Speaker 0: I was just talking about this.

1011
01:03:50,947 --> 01:04:04,700
Speaker 0: like USB C to HDMI probably has a whole computer in it Yep, like a processor and everything and RAM, you know, yep, and even though it's 15 $20 USB-c cables may or may not have support for certain like weird advanced function.

1012
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,356
Speaker 0: It's possible that like if you get el cheapo USB C cable that you were using to charge like some.

1013
01:04:09,878 --> 01:04:17,556
Speaker 0: I don't know your Bicycle light which my current bicycle lights right now use micro USB C, but I'm micro USB, but I'm sure in the future They'll be USB C.

1014
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,066
Speaker 1: But here's where it'll matter some.

1015
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:26,760
Speaker 0: some cable that comes with the light that you use to charge your you know You used to charge your bicycle light is probably not gonna work if you try to send 4k video.

1016
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:28,587
Speaker 1: Here is where it'll matter to you.

1017
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:32,100
Speaker 1: Here's the practical reason why you'll need to know this a little bit.

1018
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:35,348
Speaker 1: USB-c cables can only be about two meters long.

1019
01:04:35,729 --> 01:04:39,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are many cases where you want a really really long USB cable.

1020
01:04:39,886 --> 01:04:41,199
Speaker 1: It's not gonna work, right?

1021
01:04:42,222 --> 01:04:51,113
Speaker 1: Usually for video output a really really long USB 3 cable is also not gonna work now Like the one long USB cable I have for that oculus sensor up there.

1022
01:04:51,414 --> 01:04:53,220
Speaker 1: That is like the maximum length.

1023
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,488
Speaker 1: They're gonna be like the light.

1024
01:04:55,508 --> 01:04:58,560
Speaker 0: the length you need is the length to plug it in next to your bed.

1025
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,608
Speaker 0: I'm where your night.

1026
01:04:59,648 --> 01:05:03,680
Speaker 0: your USB thing is by your night I don't know, but here's why I hold your phone in bed while it charges.

1027
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,884
Speaker 0: That's how long you need it to be.

1028
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:08,377
Speaker 1: USB C cables cannot be more than two meters.

1029
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:09,260
Speaker 0: Okay, that's wrong.

1030
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:11,145
Speaker 0: Also two meters is pretty long.

1031
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:17,020
Speaker 1: However, if you you can get USB C cables that are longer.

1032
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,760
Speaker 1: There's a. there's a spec accounts for having a really long cable up to four meters.

1033
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,850
Speaker 1: He can double the length.

1034
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:24,939
Speaker 0: that is hella long.

1035
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:35,400
Speaker 0: But your if your entertainment system is more than four meters from your TV and your stereo No Whatever it needs to be dams or rearrange your room and all that means is that those?

1036
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:41,880
Speaker 1: USB-c cables will only support USB 2.0 speeds and will not support weird alternate modes.

1037
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:48,337
Speaker 1: So if you use a USB C cable to plug into your des And you use a graph four meter cable.

1038
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:48,839
Speaker 1: It won't work.

1039
01:05:49,161 --> 01:05:52,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's really the only cable problem.

1040
01:05:52,111 --> 01:05:54,218
Speaker 0: Why is your dad's four meters from your computer?

1041
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:59,560
Speaker 1: Yeah Right, seriously, so I look forward to the death of lightning.

1042
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:06,577
Speaker 0: I look forward to the death of every data cable and Powering small devices that have their own batteries.

1043
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:07,040
Speaker 0: cable.

1044
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:20,121
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not shaped with USB C on both ends because right now Most of the cables I have are actually regularly old USB on one end and USB C on the other because like my anchor Charging hub doesn't have isn't five USB C's it's.

1045
01:06:20,422 --> 01:06:26,219
Speaker 1: yeah, I want to get to the point where I just want to start replacing a lot of like I want to put in all My power outlets are on the house.

1046
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,264
Speaker 0: Oh, I forgot.

1047
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:29,332
Speaker 0: one more thing you can do is the cave.

1048
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,360
Speaker 0: you get a cable that's USB C on both ends.

1049
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd be shocked what you can do with that.

1050
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,640
Speaker 0: I don't cuz I can plug your devices.

1051
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:36,985
Speaker 1: They just they work it.

1052
01:06:37,145 --> 01:06:43,213
Speaker 0: I can connect for example my you know micro four-thirds You know Panasonic gh5.

1053
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:45,224
Speaker 0: Plug one end.

1054
01:06:45,324 --> 01:06:47,572
Speaker 0: USB C has USB C hole on it.

1055
01:06:47,874 --> 01:06:49,038
Speaker 0: other end in the iPad.

1056
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:49,600
Speaker 0: it works.

1057
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:52,179
Speaker 0: It actually shows up and the iPads like Oh import photos.

1058
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:55,790
Speaker 0: do All that crazy shit actually works.

1059
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:57,414
Speaker 0: just connect to devices.

1060
01:06:57,494 --> 01:06:59,640
Speaker 0: plug your GoPro into your computer.

1061
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:12,357
Speaker 1: Boom stuff's happening when you connect that USB C game free USB C cameras if they were serious like big cameras tended to have one USB port to be a host and one to be a connector.

1062
01:07:12,377 --> 01:07:24,125
Speaker 0: obviously your Experience may vary with different shitty or better devices But yeah for the most part if two devices have USB C And there's some logical reason to connect the two and you do so Something's gonna happen when you plug them in.

1063
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:28,460
Speaker 1: yeah, and unlike the old days was on the go that something will probably not be a fire.

Speaker 1: we just uploaded the episode to the patron patreon exclusive about snow white and the seven dwarfs and That will be public sometime this week on patreon.

1077
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,423
Speaker 1: You should listen to it.

1078
01:09:11,624 --> 01:09:23,130
Speaker 1: and now I leave you with Hopping around Tokyo City like a big playground when suddenly Batman first on the shade and hit Godzilla with a bat grenade.

1079
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:29,210
Speaker 1: Godzilla got pissed and began to attack but didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq.

1080
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:35,920
Speaker 1: When Aaron Carter came out of the blue and he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile.

1081
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:43,149
Speaker 1: before he could make it back to the Batcave Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave and took a naked 47 up from under his hat and blew Batman away.

1082
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:48,649
Speaker 1: It was right at that time, but he ran out of balls and he ran away because all of this crime came to save the day.

1083
01:09:49,073 --> 01:09:50,345
Speaker 1: This is the ultimate showdown.

1084
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,050
Speaker 1: Ultimate destiny could grab bad guys and explosions.

1085
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,583
Speaker 1: As far as the I can see, there's only one will survive.

1086
01:09:59,724 --> 01:10:01,330
Speaker 1: I wonder who it will be.

1087
01:10:01,733 --> 01:10:05,748
Speaker 0: This is the ultimate showdown The ultimate destiny.

1088
01:10:13,821 --> 01:10:24,339
Speaker 1: Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back and Batman was injured and trying to get steady.

1089
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:30,540
Speaker 1: when Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete but suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped in the end and took him out with his whips.

1090
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,693
Speaker 1: Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind.

1091
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:34,864
Speaker 1: then he reached for his son Which he just couldn't find.

1092
01:10:34,884 --> 01:10:45,367
Speaker 1: cuz Batman stole it and he shot and he missed and Jackie Chan deflected it with his fists And he jumped in the air and he did a somersault while Abraham Lincoln tried to pull a fault onto Optimus Prime But they collided in the air.

1093
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:47,600
Speaker 1: then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare.

1094
01:10:48,022 --> 01:10:49,900
Speaker 1: This is the ultimate showdown.

1095
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:53,689
Speaker 1: Ultimate destiny could grab bad guys and explosions.

1096
01:10:55,022 --> 01:10:57,998
Speaker 1: As far as the I can see, there's only one will survive.
