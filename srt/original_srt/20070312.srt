1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,376
Speaker 1: It's Monday March 12.

2
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:11,958
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:14,043
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,509
Speaker 1: We have no internets.

5
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,108
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:37,922
Speaker 0: So all of our faithful listeners might have noticed that there was in fact no show last Thursday night Which is a rare occurrence because it's very not often that we miss a show here Especially when there's no conventions or other weird things going on.

7
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:40,730
Speaker 1: that are pretty much the only thing they can stop us from making shows.

8
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:44,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean when we lays out we usually have another excuse.

9
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:48,759
Speaker 0: in addition and this time We were pretty much destroyed from all fronts.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,925
Speaker 0: You see our internet connection went down now.

11
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,949
Speaker 0: It didn't just go down.

12
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,063
Speaker 0: it went Down and it's still not up.

13
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:56,410
Speaker 1: This is real bad.

14
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:07,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're having to record the show go over to a friend's house with a flash drive and then upload it And i'm not liking this at all.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,183
Speaker 1: no it's bad.

16
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:12,000
Speaker 0: see now a few weeks ago I mean our internet is stupid fast.

17
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,310
Speaker 0: It's always been incredibly fast.

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's not an oc3 But like I expect not I don't expect much from the local cable or dsl company.

19
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:25,870
Speaker 1: I expect them to give me something faster than dial-up.

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:40,704
Speaker 1: That's good enough to watch youtube our cable vision, you know as as whatever and I regardless of what else I have to say about that company and certain things they do while they own madison square garden and such Optima online is pretty good.

21
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:46,009
Speaker 1: I mean It it's what we get like 13 down and two up or something like that.

22
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:50,690
Speaker 1: Yeah unlimited and they don't filter us on anything and we get that all the time.

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,819
Speaker 0: Our internet speed really never drops ever.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,170
Speaker 0: It's always just this amazing never-ending beast.

25
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:04,910
Speaker 1: I'm sure part of it is because no one else on our in our area like living on our street probably has Or none or none or none or none or none or none of them use it enough to take away our bandwidth.

26
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:08,884
Speaker 0: Well, even if they did there aren't many houses near us period yeah.

27
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:12,335
Speaker 1: and also You know They don't seem to care what we do.

28
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,475
Speaker 1: we can bit torrent and we can do whatever we want and optum online doesn't really seem to care.

29
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:27,130
Speaker 0: so a couple weeks ago randomly, we started losing internet like our cable modem would just Lose sync for a little bit and then our network would go down for like a minute and then it would come back.

30
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, i'd go and unplug the cable modem plug it back in and it would work again.

31
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,198
Speaker 1: So i'd be like, all right, we're back up now.

32
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,470
Speaker 0: It wasn't happening with any increasing frequency.

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,181
Speaker 0: It just happened on this semi-regular basis starting suddenly.

34
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,690
Speaker 0: So whatever we figured if this keeps up We're going to call and make a complaint.

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,063
Speaker 0: And then one day I believe this was thursday.

36
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:45,404
Speaker 1: Yes.

37
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:46,950
Speaker 1: Well, here's what happened thursday, right?

38
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:48,854
Speaker 1: So I bought this.

39
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,689
Speaker 1: I ordered this laptop because I gave back my old laptop to the job.

40
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,702
Speaker 1: I quit So I had to buy a new one.

41
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,730
Speaker 1: So I bought a new one.

42
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,501
Speaker 1: I ordered it from Fujitsu the company that makes it now.

43
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:02,355
Speaker 0: never mind all the shipping issues got had You mean like how?

44
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,986
Speaker 1: I ordered it in the middle of february and it didn't come until thursday.

45
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:06,487
Speaker 1: Yeah.

46
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:11,029
Speaker 1: Yeah Uh, yeah, and how ups sucks and doesn't accommodate people who work all day.

47
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,021
Speaker 0: But no scott gets it and he opens it up.

48
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,127
Speaker 0: He's really excited about it.

49
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,217
Speaker 0: I gotta admit It's a really nice cool little laptop.

50
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:17,442
Speaker 0: I really like it.

51
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,386
Speaker 0: It's I like it.

52
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:18,948
Speaker 0: What can I say?

53
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:19,390
Speaker 0: It's good.

54
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,610
Speaker 0: So he's starting to set it all up.

55
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:27,670
Speaker 0: So he starts, you know Let's vista boot and he'll talk about vista later because it took a while to boot the first time a long time.

56
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:33,779
Speaker 0: But then he goes on the wireless to try to download firefox And he starts getting concerned because it's not.

57
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,649
Speaker 1: the internet is really really slow and it would have taken me It said firefox downloading five hours and I was like what?

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,177
Speaker 1: Firefox shouldn't take five hours to download.

59
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:47,816
Speaker 0: so I go upstairs and I get on my computer just to look and My internet's fine.

60
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,724
Speaker 0: I get it stupid fast like always.

61
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,534
Speaker 0: so I come back down and say hey scott It's fine.

62
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:52,603
Speaker 0: Something's wrong with your laptop.

63
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,410
Speaker 0: So he's worried.

64
00:03:53,571 --> 00:04:01,398
Speaker 1: So I plug the wire in instead of using the wireless and it's still That it's not working at all for a second.

65
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,770
Speaker 0: so scott's can't download anything and he's getting kind of worried about this.

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,899
Speaker 0: He's looking for drivers.

67
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,150
Speaker 0: Maybe so there's a conflict.

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,922
Speaker 0: Maybe there's something wrong with it because every time his is slow.

69
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,550
Speaker 0: I go upstairs to my computer and it's fine.

70
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:16,721
Speaker 1: That was only really like two times three times three times.

71
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:17,906
Speaker 1: I don't think it was three times.

72
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:18,610
Speaker 0: It was three times.

73
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:25,383
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was fast for me for like a minute and I was able to download firefox at in I don't know six seconds when it was working properly.

74
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:26,510
Speaker 1: It took the download firefox.

75
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's real fast when it works.

76
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:35,570
Speaker 1: Anyway a little while later it after being slow It just stopped working entirely.

77
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:52,829
Speaker 0: Yep You see the timing was that every time I went upstairs and it happened to be working again And then every time I went downstairs it happened to not be working again And it was basically this binary boolean situation of on off On off and then one time it just went off and didn't come back

78
00:04:53,472 --> 00:05:01,449
Speaker 1: And it you know, what would happen is I would look at the modal modem and it has Basically, the only light that matters because it's got like six lights on it.

79
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:10,621
Speaker 1: The only light that matters is the one that says cable and basically if it's getting a signal from the cable company Then that light will turn on and stay on.

80
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,670
Speaker 1: if that light is off you're in trouble.

81
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:23,390
Speaker 1: And if that light is blinking that means it's trying to get a signal now occasionally for like a on Friday like the light would stay on for a bit, but you wouldn't actually be able to do anything.

82
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,639
Speaker 1: We got like 56 packet loss.

83
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so every other package just doesn't make it where it's going.

84
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,337
Speaker 0: You can't really do anything on the internet that way.

85
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:38,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, and while tcpip we talked about has reliability stuff going on If you lose that many packets, you basically can't do anything.

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:55,170
Speaker 0: I mean you could but like firefox and most applications that you use in a normal basis are not equipped to use Sort of thing sort of thing sort of thing sort of thing sort of thing and tcpip in a packet loss situation Can actually end up being worse than udp because of the act stuff, but i'm not going to get into that.

87
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:55,488
Speaker 0: Yeah

88
00:05:55,951 --> 00:06:17,503
Speaker 1: But you know, there's also the problem of uh timeouts where even if you're losing 56 percent of the packets and you're resending packets That you missed okay, so you're getting 46 Performance which is actually a lot less than 46 performance because the way things work It just takes so long to load the web page and you know Your web browser will just give up if it takes too long to get it.

89
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:19,010
Speaker 1: So you can't do anything at all.

90
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,750
Speaker 0: Yeah old web browsers would be a lot more patient.

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,011
Speaker 0: I remember going to websites back in the day where i'd have to sit there for three or four minutes waiting for each page to Load.

92
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:35,329
Speaker 1: I mean, i'm sure I could have gone to about config and changed the timeout in firefox and loaded a page or two But is it really worth my time to sit there for an hour?

93
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,349
Speaker 1: To load one web page?

94
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:44,790
Speaker 0: So the one thing we were able to determine when we got onto the optimum site once was that there was in fact a regional outage.

95
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:52,350
Speaker 1: Well, I went to optonline.net to look at the system status, which is pretty handy that they put their system status on the internet.

96
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:57,390
Speaker 0: So so if my internet's down I can log on to their website and find out if my internet's down.

97
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:10,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, and basically all it said was that you know The cable tv was a-okay the phone that because they have digital phone service It was a-okay and that internet service was having issues and I was like, okay They're having issues.

98
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,242
Speaker 1: that explains it and I let it be at that.

99
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:17,717
Speaker 1: now you every time they've had issues in the past It's always been fixed, you know by the next day.

100
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:21,950
Speaker 1: We woke up the next morning on friday and it wasn't working at all.

101
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:29,870
Speaker 0: I tried to do my morning ritual and I was paralyzed by the fact that I could not read penny arcade Nor could I get into google reader or look at dig?

102
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,330
Speaker 1: Well, I had no choice but to go to work, which I did.

103
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:40,130
Speaker 0: I also went to work after grousing to scott as I passed him that the internet's not working and then we got home on friday.

104
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:41,866
Speaker 1: It still wasn't working.

105
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:45,297
Speaker 0: So Worse than ever.

106
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,509
Speaker 0: so eventually scott calls alex.

107
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:55,660
Speaker 1: Well, I called alex just because he also has optimum online but lives in our town But not in our house and he was having no problems at all.

108
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:55,961
Speaker 0: Yeah.

109
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,114
Speaker 0: In fact, he hadn't had a problem from the start Huh?

110
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,510
Speaker 0: So then scott tries to call the optimum online help number which you think would be an easy thing to do.

111
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:17,589
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, here's the problem is I look in the phone book for cable vision because that's the company that provides optimum online And I find their number for our area duchess county and I call it and it gives you the.

112
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:18,897
Speaker 1: you know The phone menu.

113
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:22,014
Speaker 1: press one for english, you know I push one for english.

114
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:31,827
Speaker 1: and then they say push one if you want to pay your bill push two if you want to do Right, it's like push two for service appointments and repair related activities.

115
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,878
Speaker 1: and I was like Okay, that's not the option I need.

116
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,246
Speaker 1: that was the option I needed.

117
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:42,027
Speaker 1: if you push two Then it says push one for internet push two for cable and push three for phone.

118
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:50,355
Speaker 1: you push one for internet And then it says, you know to talk to customer service push this next number and i'm like, oh god damn And it was totally.

119
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,770
Speaker 1: the menu system did not point me in the right direction.

120
00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:01,428
Speaker 1: So for the longest time I thought that there was another number I had to call to get the correct menu option And it took me like 30 minutes just to call the right number.

121
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:01,850
Speaker 1: It sucked.

122
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:05,282
Speaker 0: So eventually we get through and they say, you know, oh we'll send a tech out.

123
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,172
Speaker 0: and they send a tech out and the mystery begins To deepen.

124
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,476
Speaker 1: well, here's the thing.

125
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:13,409
Speaker 1: Remember how I was complaining about ups not accommodating people who aren't home all day?

126
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,542
Speaker 1: Well cable vision doesn't accommodate people who aren't home all day.

127
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:17,225
Speaker 1: that well either.

128
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,290
Speaker 0: they do it a lot better.

129
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,183
Speaker 1: They do it better than ups but not that much better.

130
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:33,609
Speaker 1: your choices are during the week You can have someone come like in a three-hour window like between 10 and Like one or one and four or five and eight or something like that.

131
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:37,309
Speaker 1: None of those are good for someone who's out of the house seven to seven every day.

132
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,270
Speaker 1: So they can come on the weekend.

133
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,721
Speaker 1: But if they come on the weekend, they promise they'll come between 10 a.m.

134
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:54,290
Speaker 1: And 8 p.m So it's like fuck you 10 a.m And 8 p.m You've got to sit in your house or be close to your house for 10 hours out of the day.

135
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,090
Speaker 0: I particularly like how they said oh, he'll call before he comes and there was no call.

136
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,388
Speaker 0: But yet suddenly out of the blue this optim online truck appears.

137
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:08,790
Speaker 1: Yep I mean like in the day before they came because I the appointment I made was for when?

138
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,336
Speaker 1: Sunday, right on saturday.

139
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:14,929
Speaker 1: They called me twice to let me to make sure that we wanted the guy to come sunday.

140
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:16,630
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

141
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,430
Speaker 0: So the guy showed up and first he goes and looks at the outside part And he sees a bunch of old stuff and he replaces it.

142
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,735
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, this stuff's old It has never been replaced.

143
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,870
Speaker 0: and then he comes inside and he tests and he doesn't get any signal.

144
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,965
Speaker 0: Then he tested another hole and he doesn't get any signal and he tested another hole.

145
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,330
Speaker 0: He gets a weak ass signal.

146
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,809
Speaker 0: So see starts telling us that the lines inside our house are bad.

147
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:40,308
Speaker 0: But then just to be sure because he's got a nagging kind of huh?

148
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:48,607
Speaker 0: He goes back outside and he climbs up the pole in front of our house And he fills around up there for like 10 minutes and he comes back down.

149
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,998
Speaker 0: He tests in the house He goes back up there.

150
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:55,466
Speaker 0: He's going around for a while And basically there are numerous issues here and they still haven't solved them all.

151
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,690
Speaker 0: for one The wiring inside of our house the coaxial cables.

152
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,858
Speaker 0: No one knows where they go.

153
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,547
Speaker 0: They're just kind of this mess.

154
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:11,850
Speaker 0: i'm thinking Whenever I get free time like next weekend before they come I'm going to disconnect all of our stuff plug my fluke in and see if I can trace this stuff out through the wall.

155
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,830
Speaker 1: I don't know where the hell this stuff goes.

156
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,929
Speaker 1: I mean it goes from the pole outside To our house down the side of the house into this box.

157
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:29,930
Speaker 1: Then they come out of the box and into a hole in the foundation of the house And then there are mystery coaxial holes appearing throughout the house in random places.

158
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:31,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know where this thing comes out.

159
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:43,998
Speaker 0: I mean it has to split at some point because now obviously I know what happened here because this happens a lot in older houses Someone who builds a house and doesn't know much about anything or actually a lot of people Who have a pre-existing house do this too.

160
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,528
Speaker 0: They get cable then they have a bunch of TVs.

161
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,801
Speaker 0: now They don't know anything about signal loss or degradation or attenuation.

162
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,930
Speaker 0: So they just buy a bunch of splitters stick them all over the place.

163
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,569
Speaker 0: So they have coaxial going every room in the house and then they wonder whether cable tv is fuzzy and their internet doesn't work.

164
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:07,765
Speaker 0: Ah, so inside of our walls are coaxial cables that go about in various directions Which was never a problem before.

165
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:18,080
Speaker 0: in fact Our internet was stupid fast before despite the fact that one of the cables we're using which goes across my room and into the hall Where all of our network equipment is is stupidly bad.

166
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,367
Speaker 0: Like it's a terrible coaxial cable.

167
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:21,230
Speaker 0: He tested.

168
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,475
Speaker 0: He's like that cable is bad.

169
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:23,058
Speaker 0: Don't use it.

170
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it still works.

171
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:25,710
Speaker 0: It will it works.

172
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:33,337
Speaker 0: See the issue is apparently he tests on the on the pole and he says yeah It looks like at the pole.

173
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:38,190
Speaker 0: You're like 12 decibels below what you should be at the signal's real weak.

174
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:44,150
Speaker 0: So the signal was just strong enough before to get through that crappy wiring in your house to get to your cable modem.

175
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:49,129
Speaker 0: But now that the outside signal drops It's not going to cut it with that crappy wiring anymore.

176
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:55,589
Speaker 1: So supposedly today while I was at work some guys came and fixed the stuff outside on the pole.

177
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,570
Speaker 0: now The actual answer is that nothing has changed as far as we can tell.

178
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:07,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can look outside because I saw the spot where the original guy was working And I looked there and the equipment had changed.

179
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,110
Speaker 1: there is new stuff on the wires outside.

180
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:13,163
Speaker 1: It hasn't changed anything with the inside situation at all.

181
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,810
Speaker 1: I have no internet none.

182
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:21,908
Speaker 1: And I called the internet guys to be like, hey, it's still not working and they're like, oh shits You're the top priority fix now blah blah blah.

183
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:29,840
Speaker 1: But the guy at you know at the cable company they can test to see if they can get a signal to you with their equipment And he's like, yeah, I got no signal to you man.

184
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,486
Speaker 1: And i'm like, that's fantastic.

185
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,370
Speaker 1: You're awesome.

186
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:40,389
Speaker 0: Now I love how before they said oh someone will come within 48 hours But now that we're a priority case someone will come within a week.

187
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,880
Speaker 1: Well, they'll come when I make an appointment.

188
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,161
Speaker 1: I could make an appointment for like wednesday Between 10 and 1 but people go to work.

189
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,558
Speaker 1: People can't be home.

190
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,463
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

191
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:58,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, luckily Dear emily is hanging around for spring break working on animation and other things.

192
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:06,990
Speaker 0: So Hopefully we will be able to let her sit here and meet this stupid cable guy And let him do whatever he needs to do to get geek nights back on the road.

193
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:16,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, if she wasn't here, I would have had to sit here and meet the cable guy at 10 am on Saturday which also would have put a little bit of a damper on all of our plans to go out to albany and hang out With.

194
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:24,726
Speaker 1: that might still be the case, but tomorrow I will try to call and reschedule To get the early wednesday when emily is here and i'll tell her everything to tell the guy.

195
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:34,670
Speaker 1: and also supposedly They are going to send out Senior type, you know the highest level of senior technician who will come and not leave until everything is fixed.

196
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:38,809
Speaker 0: At least while the guy scott was talking to on the phone was not the most knowledgeable guy.

197
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,010
Speaker 0: The tech they sent out to our house knew what he was doing.

198
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,201
Speaker 0: Enough to identify the problem and then leave.

199
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,590
Speaker 1: yeah anyone who has that job, you know knows enough.

200
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,470
Speaker 1: You can't get that job and not know anything.

201
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,589
Speaker 1: You'd go to places and just be blah and then people would all be upset to be useless.

202
00:14:53,609 --> 00:15:01,084
Speaker 1: Yep He had the real fluke too the kind of fluke I always wanted like imagine if I showed up at a house to be A cable guy and i'd be like, yeah, i'm here to fix your cable.

203
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:06,164
Speaker 1: and then I was just like, uh Okay, bye i've seen that happen before.

204
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:07,330
Speaker 0: really i've had.

205
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:12,610
Speaker 0: When I lived in michigan, we had a cable guy come to try to fix our cable and he basically tracked mud into the house.

206
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,756
Speaker 0: That was all he accomplished.

207
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,209
Speaker 0: Wow his stellar, dude Okay.

208
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,810
Speaker 0: So yeah, there's gonna be no things today because I don't have the internet in front of me.

209
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:31,359
Speaker 0: In fact, I haven't been on the internet since thursday Morning, I was able to do some stuff at work today.

210
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,570
Speaker 1: But in my new job, I actually work a lot see curse of curses.

211
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:42,978
Speaker 0: I had work to do on friday and I had even more work to do on monday today And I didn't even touch a computer.

212
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:46,070
Speaker 0: I got online at my office for five minutes.

213
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,029
Speaker 0: I checked my email to make sure there was nothing critical going on.

214
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:53,590
Speaker 0: I looked into forums to make sure everybody wasn't dead and then I went to do my business.

215
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,620
Speaker 1: This is really not so good at all.

216
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:01,400
Speaker 0: Yes, especially since listenership is up Not that any of you care, but we're good.

217
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,330
Speaker 0: It seems like things are really picking up suddenly.

218
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,066
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was because of katsukan or just randomly but whatever it doesn't help.

219
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,030
Speaker 1: also that you know.

220
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,374
Speaker 1: Hey, I got this new laptop.

221
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:21,448
Speaker 1: I'd really like to you know install software install software on it possibly download some Ubuntu packages But no, there's no internet and the wireless internet at work Doesn't work.

222
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:24,409
Speaker 1: So and there isn't an extra wire at my desk.

223
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:33,389
Speaker 1: So i'm pretty much sol with this thing until uh, you know that I waited half a month to get it And now I can't do anything with it except uh watch dvds.

224
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:41,424
Speaker 0: Thus tonight we are going to talk about the ramifications Of not having internet access in an age of internet.

225
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:50,230
Speaker 0: because you see this is a problem that It really wasn't a problem In recent memory and has become a problem for me in my life and in scott's life in a lot of geek's lives.

226
00:16:50,632 --> 00:17:08,430
Speaker 0: I mean think about it way back when you had a computer before I don't know how many of you are old enough But when you had a computer before the internet when maybe you could dial into prodigy online or aol The computer in and of itself was entertaining and useful you would use your computer whether or not there was an internet connection.

227
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:16,430
Speaker 0: I mean I would go to my computer and do stuff And many times I wouldn't even bother dialing into prodigy like I only dialed in if I needed to go online for something.

228
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,123
Speaker 1: I think a lot of that was that in those days.

229
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:24,698
Speaker 1: I was actually doing A lot of word processing type stuff.

230
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:28,950
Speaker 1: I was doing a lot of pc games that were not network pc games.

231
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:32,130
Speaker 0: I was also playing with the computer just learning about computers a lot.

232
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was playing with the computer itself because the computer itself.

233
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:37,348
Speaker 1: I still had things to learn about it.

234
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:53,624
Speaker 1: now There's nothing for me to learn about the computer i'm holding, you know The only thing I can learn is by getting information from other people using the computers as a tool, you know It's like I spent when you don't know about computers the computer itself learning.

235
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:55,930
Speaker 1: This is crazy advanced tool is interesting.

236
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,908
Speaker 1: It's sort of like if I had a fluke, right?

237
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,579
Speaker 1: Uh, the fluke is such a crazy advanced tool.

238
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:06,064
Speaker 1: just having one even having nothing to do with it Would be fun because i'd poke around and learn all the things it can.

239
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:07,350
Speaker 0: do you want to play with my fluke?

240
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,480
Speaker 1: No, not really.

241
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:17,158
Speaker 1: I got better things to do But once I learned everything it would just sit there and I have no use for it unless I suddenly have a use for it Which I do.

242
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:18,009
Speaker 0: i'm excited about this.

243
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:27,247
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use the fluke's uh cable finding technology to figure out where these coaxial cables are And maybe hunt down where these repeaters are or splitters are or whatever and get rid of them.

244
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,438
Speaker 1: Yep Well, we need to split something.

245
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,665
Speaker 1: So the old lady has cable.

246
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,040
Speaker 0: Well, theoretically She should have a separate drop.

247
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,490
Speaker 0: So I don't know what's going on with cable vision in the first place.

248
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:37,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, I figured they.

249
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:40,203
Speaker 1: I think they think hey, it's one house one wire.

250
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:42,290
Speaker 1: save money, you know, and it still works.

251
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:43,238
Speaker 1: It worked for a while.

252
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:44,367
Speaker 1: So what's the deal?

253
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,230
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, i'm gonna track it down because this I don't get to do stuff like that anymore.

254
00:18:48,230 --> 00:19:03,769
Speaker 0: I mean my job all my jobs have moved so far away from Looking at cables and doing the fun stuff to where basically like I supervise And I I say what to do or I write up documentation after the fact or I push paper around.

255
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:08,407
Speaker 0: Granted I don't like crawling under floors so much but I like using flukes.

256
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:08,990
Speaker 0: What can I say?

257
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,418
Speaker 1: It's fun to use tools and that's why it's fun to use the computer because the computer Is an all-purpose amazing.

258
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:26,917
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the best tool ever and using it is fun And once you know how to use it It's no longer fun unless you have a use sort of like if you got a hammer And you learn how to use the hammer.

259
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:33,428
Speaker 1: It's fun to just hammer nails for no reason, but once you've done that Is the hammer is no fun without actual nailing to do.

260
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:40,449
Speaker 0: yeah I mean, I remember when I was a kid the first time my dad or my grandpa just let me play with a hammer And I just hammered nails into a board for like an hour.

261
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:48,870
Speaker 0: And seriously, I was playing with this hammer and this wrench and all these tools They gave me and I I ended up screwing a bunch of screws and nailing a bunch of nails into this one piece of wood.

262
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,649
Speaker 1: But now we have a hammer don't we?

263
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, well actually then it wasn't that much later that my grandpa was building something and he wanted my help.

264
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:02,307
Speaker 0: So I was nailing a bunch of boards together and it stopped being fun after about 10 seconds.

265
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,124
Speaker 0: Yep So then fast forward a little bit to middle school now.

266
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:12,863
Speaker 0: I got a cable modem I get I go online with like five or six ie windows open go to all different websites.

267
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:21,628
Speaker 0: I have friends online friends who I have Only online and I have friends in the town that I only talk to online because none of us call each other.

268
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:23,517
Speaker 0: phones are There weren't cell phones?

269
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:24,523
Speaker 1: phones are so 1800s, man.

270
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:29,970
Speaker 0: I mean seriously though that like in middle school and even early high school.

271
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:34,610
Speaker 0: It was weird because cell phones really weren't around yet Like we had a cell phone.

272
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:41,685
Speaker 0: But it's not like I could just call my friends on that cell phone because it cost like a dollar a minute to use it And the battery lasted about 45 minutes.

273
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:51,098
Speaker 0: but I communicated with all my friends via icq online and I never used aol Those even aol users.

274
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:58,310
Speaker 1: I was all with the aol's mostly because they didn't have a choice like I knew that aol was no good, you know.

275
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:09,830
Speaker 1: But I didn't have a choice other than dial up because nothing else was available in the area at the time And I was trying to figure out and research what was the correct thing to get but in the end I had no choice.

276
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,110
Speaker 1: I got aol and that's what we had for a few years until eventually my parents got the dsl.

277
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:21,070
Speaker 0: But even then when the internet went down It wasn't a big deal like like when I was a freshman in high school or when I was in eighth grade.

278
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,910
Speaker 0: Like if I walked into the rec room and I couldn't get online I saw the cable modem was blinking.

279
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,890
Speaker 0: I would have this son of a bitch moment and then I'd just go do something else because it's not like I needed the internet.

280
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,476
Speaker 0: All that communication could wait.

281
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:37,450
Speaker 0: It's not like news was coming at this incredible rate on the internet.

282
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:38,730
Speaker 0: It wasn't news that I cared about.

283
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,950
Speaker 1: I mean in the aol days i'd be kind of pissed if I couldn't get on aol because that was sort of like.

284
00:21:44,030 --> 00:22:00,645
Speaker 1: You know the the coolest thing to do on the computer is to go and chat room or go and play A mud or something like that or visit a website, you know, it was sort of like if you had a a game console And one of the games your favorite game was only available sometimes.

285
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,235
Speaker 1: so if the game's not available It's not the biggest deal, you know.

286
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:14,098
Speaker 1: if you came into my house and took like, you know The the the we game that i'm playing at the moment like out of the house for like an hour a day That wouldn't really bother me so much.

287
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:14,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

288
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,458
Speaker 0: I mean back then when the cable went out It was like cable tv going out.

289
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:19,040
Speaker 0: I just all right.

290
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,029
Speaker 0: I got to do something else and it wasn't a big deal.

291
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,446
Speaker 0: Fast forward we're at rit.

292
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:30,257
Speaker 0: If the if the internet went out which happened once or twice There was we were stuck.

293
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,083
Speaker 0: We was like having no electricity.

294
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:34,030
Speaker 0: the power had might as well have been out.

295
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:43,326
Speaker 0: In fact the power being out as opposed to just the internet being out was preferable Because if the power was out then now everything's all interesting.

296
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:47,183
Speaker 0: We can't turn on lights We all get together and play board games by candlelight.

297
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:48,530
Speaker 0: it was always fun when that happened.

298
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, power outs are awesome.

299
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,411
Speaker 1: blackouts blackouts rule I.

300
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:57,050
Speaker 0: I have to admit that I have had fun in just about every blackout that i've ever lived through.

301
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,340
Speaker 1: Actually, the uh, the job that I just quit was very.

302
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,366
Speaker 1: the people there were very fond of blackouts.

303
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,450
Speaker 1: They love the blackouts.

304
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:05,697
Speaker 1: They were there during the big blackout.

305
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:10,652
Speaker 0: I was directing traffic during the big blackout and that morning I was.

306
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:11,837
Speaker 1: why were you directing traffic?

307
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:18,709
Speaker 0: because I had nothing else to do and traffic was snarled up near my house And I was out riding my bike watching the chaos as people tried to commute home.

308
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:22,410
Speaker 0: Uh, okay, so I just went out and directed traffic at this intersection.

309
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,990
Speaker 0: It was fun because I saw other people doing it at other intersections.

310
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,154
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

311
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:30,170
Speaker 0: I should tell the story of what happened to me during that blackout some other time.

312
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, because because that was a funny story the black.

313
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:48,109
Speaker 0: Yes, it was but I will say this I was standing Amidst a giant data center at a factory and ibm working on a server When the power outage happened and the power went out in the data center and I didn't know what to do.

314
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:50,999
Speaker 0: I was not prepared for that eventuality.

315
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,748
Speaker 0: That was the last thing I expected to happen that day.

316
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,194
Speaker 1: All right Anyway, all right.

317
00:23:55,294 --> 00:24:07,090
Speaker 1: Anyway, but if the internet goes out, it's sort of like If you're hammering if you're building something with your hammer and your nails And you run out of nails and you go to home depot and there's no nails for sale.

318
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:09,288
Speaker 1: But you're in the middle of building something.

319
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:24,976
Speaker 1: Because the internet all of us all of us on the internet us podcasting you listening to the podcast people on wikipedia We are all now Constantly collectively building a thing And we can't stop building it.

320
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,801
Speaker 0: It's a lot like ghost in the shell.

321
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,890
Speaker 0: Our cyber brains are slowly becoming parallel to one another.

322
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:37,861
Speaker 1: it's like I don't know if we're all writing a big book together and then we all ran out of ink And it's not done yet.

323
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:44,066
Speaker 0: Think of this geeks like us Especially people who listen to podcasts and you know read slashdot or dig or fark or whatever that you're.

324
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,677
Speaker 0: whenever you're on a computer You're almost constantly communicating.

325
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:56,264
Speaker 0: you are at many times throughout the day many many many times Continually in contact with hundreds if not thousands of other human beings.

326
00:24:56,605 --> 00:25:02,445
Speaker 0: you have the ability to contact Almost anyone in the industrialized world at any moment if you want to.

327
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:06,949
Speaker 1: now, it's not so bad I mean, it's kind of bad if it all stops around the world.

328
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:12,230
Speaker 1: But imagine if so everyone is working together on something and you're working with the team, right?

329
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:26,830
Speaker 1: And then you miss a meeting So everyone works on stuff without you for a whole meeting and you come back the next week And you totally missed what everyone worked on the last week and they made a bunch of progress And you weren't there to experience that progress and you don't know what's going on.

330
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,432
Speaker 1: You're lost.

331
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:33,910
Speaker 1: You probably lost a lot more than just that one meeting's worth of input into the final result and it kind of sucks.

332
00:25:34,453 --> 00:25:46,313
Speaker 0: Of course, there's also a lot of humor involved because I remember at rit One time the internet was out and I remember very specifically That I was sitting on the couch in the living room and scott was sitting on the couch in the living room and alex I think was over.

333
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:46,976
Speaker 0: I forget who was over.

334
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:49,186
Speaker 0: we had a bunch of people over and we're sitting around.

335
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:49,709
Speaker 0: What are we gonna do?

336
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,643
Speaker 0: Hey, let's order pizza.

337
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:58,610
Speaker 0: and I Automatically Just went over and sat in front of my computer because I was about to just go to the papa john's website and order pizza.

338
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,530
Speaker 0: And I stopped as I was about to type and went god damn it.

339
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,397
Speaker 1: So I said what's the phone number for the pizza?

340
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:05,140
Speaker 0: and I went.

341
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,570
Speaker 0: I just opened up my web browser typed google space.

342
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,848
Speaker 0: Then I stopped and went god damn it.

343
00:26:11,082 --> 00:26:18,281
Speaker 1: I mean The problem we have is that we've replaced everything With the internet, you know, we don't go.

344
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:20,030
Speaker 1: we don't have maps from triple a anymore.

345
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,298
Speaker 1: We don't call it to order food.

346
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:26,030
Speaker 1: We don't use the phone book to find out phone numbers and addresses.

347
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,319
Speaker 0: I mean, we're not saying the royal weeks.

348
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,770
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people still use these things.

349
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,718
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we're talking us personally mean scott.

350
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,370
Speaker 1: We don't watch television for entertainment.

351
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:35,201
Speaker 0: We don't even have access to the radio.

352
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:36,570
Speaker 0: We don't have radios.

353
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:44,678
Speaker 0: It would be difficult for like it would take a good bit of effort for us to get A working radio and listen to a radio station.

354
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,310
Speaker 1: the only real things that we have to do without computers.

355
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:52,449
Speaker 1: I mean think about any creative endeavor you want to take on.

356
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:55,980
Speaker 1: Like if I decide that I want to paint a picture I need a computer.

357
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:05,770
Speaker 0: actually see that's where I disagree with you because I While I couldn't do certain things that I wanted would have otherwise done and wanted to do in my life while the internet is down.

358
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:12,430
Speaker 0: At the same time the internet being down does not in any way Bore me and I can still accomplish just as much without it.

359
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,274
Speaker 1: Well, I can accomplish things but I can't accomplish a lot of things I want to like.

360
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:21,235
Speaker 1: I can read books and I could play ds games And I guess I could.

361
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:22,239
Speaker 1: I can't really write.

362
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,090
Speaker 1: I guess I could write things because without the internet I can write.

363
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,652
Speaker 0: So you think of this.

364
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:32,115
Speaker 0: the internet was down for this past, you know, several days over the weekend and friday and thursday I've read a bunch of books.

365
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,620
Speaker 0: I started reading a bunch of books.

366
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,507
Speaker 1: I finished all my comics except one.

367
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:39,390
Speaker 0: I Continued to write my epic guide to podcasting.

368
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,082
Speaker 0: I actually wrote two new chapters in it.

369
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:46,780
Speaker 0: I went running Every day I I cleaned my trumpet.

370
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,805
Speaker 0: I buffed my trumpet.

371
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:48,590
Speaker 0: I polished it.

372
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,682
Speaker 0: I went out and tended to my bike to make sure the winner didn't destroy.

373
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:52,606
Speaker 0: I did laundry.

374
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:53,590
Speaker 0: I cleaned my room.

375
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:54,856
Speaker 0: We cleaned the house.

376
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,584
Speaker 0: I was never in the house.

377
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:56,805
Speaker 1: Yep.

378
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:57,890
Speaker 1: I was never banana bread.

379
00:27:58,392 --> 00:28:00,098
Speaker 0: I was never at a loss for something to do.

380
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:06,810
Speaker 0: and while it's annoying that I can't get all this information The quality of my life was not degraded significantly.

381
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:11,790
Speaker 0: Immediately the problem is as the internet continues to be out like each day that the internet is gone.

382
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:19,829
Speaker 0: The damage I am taking from not having internet increases Because I build up this queue of things That I want to look up or that I need to know or that I need to do.

383
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:21,476
Speaker 0: that I cannot do without the internet.

384
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:31,030
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird because like while I am slightly Like bored when I don't have the internet because I don't it takes me a while to think of what the hell to do.

385
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,530
Speaker 0: Scott you're like a morphine addict when it comes to the internet.

386
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:39,470
Speaker 0: Well, no i'm not because you were walking around the house and kind of like on edge friday when there was no internet.

387
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:40,881
Speaker 1: Well, but it's so weird.

388
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,536
Speaker 1: It's like if i'm in the house And there's no internet.

389
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,830
Speaker 1: i'm a little eh, you know, but i'll find something to do.

390
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,806
Speaker 1: I'll eventually just you know reconcile to reading a book until I finish all my books.

391
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:54,110
Speaker 1: Oh those books Yeah, those books that I you know complain that I don't have time to finish reading.

392
00:28:54,691 --> 00:29:02,547
Speaker 1: But if I go on vacation i'll go without internet for like months and I won't even blink or bat an eye or worry about It at all.

393
00:29:03,193 --> 00:29:06,910
Speaker 1: But if i'm home and the internet's out, that's suddenly the end of the world.

394
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:12,170
Speaker 0: Well, I I think part of the reason that it doesn't bother me I mean obviously it's an inconvenience a great one.

395
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:21,935
Speaker 0: but the reason it doesn't bother me is that when I went on co-op both times when I was working at ibm then when I Graduated from rit and I kept working at ibm I didn't have internet access.

396
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:25,730
Speaker 0: And in fact, I used to live in the mountains out in poquoi at the top of pleasant ridge.

397
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:35,596
Speaker 0: Not only did I not have internet access not only was internet access not available out there in any form other than Barely functional.

398
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:39,229
Speaker 0: 336 dial-up 56k didn't work out there because the phone lines were old.

399
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:43,639
Speaker 0: My cell phone didn't work because I was on the mountain.

400
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,250
Speaker 0: I had to drive 20 minutes down the mountain to make a phone call.

401
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:51,349
Speaker 1: I might try to figure out how to get my bluetooth dial-up networking to work.

402
00:29:51,852 --> 00:30:00,190
Speaker 0: So as a result when I came home from work on any given day I was Absolutely out of communication with the entire world.

403
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:08,308
Speaker 0: No one could get a hold of me and I couldn't get a hold of anyone and as a result I basically lived for three months as a hermit.

404
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to be hermit like a techno hermit.

405
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:13,497
Speaker 0: I mean, it's.

406
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I think that is weird.

407
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:32,809
Speaker 0: But pretty much every day I would come home from work at like four and i'd run for two or three hours And then i'd cook dinner and then i'd go to the bookstore and i'd read like an entire novel and then i'd come home And it would be like 10 and i'm not tired and the only thing I have to do the next day is go to work.

408
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,454
Speaker 1: Uh, it's some life.

409
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,624
Speaker 0: There you got that actually the fact that it would see.

410
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:41,679
Speaker 0: the only reason I didn't go insane And take out a bus station or something Was that I knew it.

411
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,770
Speaker 1: was you planning to take out a bus station.

412
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,619
Speaker 0: That's pretty much my default if things go wrong.

413
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:46,483
Speaker 0: I'm taking out a bus station.

414
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,910
Speaker 1: You really hate the buses that much.

415
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:49,498
Speaker 0: I really don't like buses.

416
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:51,950
Speaker 0: I got to admit i've never really had good experiences on non.

417
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,922
Speaker 1: Why don't you take out something bad though?

418
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:58,741
Speaker 1: Like I don't know a chiropractor Something Go to an acupuncturist.

419
00:30:59,003 --> 00:30:59,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go.

420
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:00,169
Speaker 1: Take them out.

421
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,359
Speaker 0: I don't know why bus station came to mind.

422
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,790
Speaker 0: I'm really indifferent to bus stations me also.

423
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:07,743
Speaker 0: In fact, the last time I was at a bus station is when I picked up greg's friend.

424
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:09,410
Speaker 0: Meredith in rochester.

425
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:14,727
Speaker 1: I guess if you if you count walking past the uh, you know the the.

426
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:15,690
Speaker 1: what's the terminal?

427
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,073
Speaker 0: What terminal?

428
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:18,902
Speaker 1: the one in the city the port authority?

429
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:19,705
Speaker 1: That's that the one?

430
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:20,087
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:20,650
Speaker 1: Yeah that one.

432
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:22,209
Speaker 0: I haven't walked by that in a while.

433
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:23,396
Speaker 1: Well, we we did.

434
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,060
Speaker 0: we walked by it.

435
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,850
Speaker 0: when you're going to the comic con I didn't go in there.

436
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,801
Speaker 1: No, i've never actually been in there ever.

437
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:28,425
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

438
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:29,350
Speaker 0: I've been in there a couple times.

439
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,830
Speaker 1: I've never gone in there because why should I go in there?

440
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,475
Speaker 1: I never get on a bus.

441
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,798
Speaker 0: when new york city was new and shiny to me I wandered in there because I was curious.

442
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:37,164
Speaker 0: I wandered into a lot of places.

443
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:45,829
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah to not get too far off topic It's real easy to get off topic when I don't have my little teleprompter in front of me telling me what to talk about.

444
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:47,973
Speaker 0: My I gotta.

445
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:52,010
Speaker 0: I got the monitor on like always but it's just a desktop with a picture of a tree.

446
00:31:53,032 --> 00:32:05,490
Speaker 1: I think the real biggest inconvenience of not having internet is not a lack of entertainment Or the lack of the most powerful tool in your tools kit, you know when you want to do things even though those are pretty big.

447
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,207
Speaker 1: It's the lack of access to information.

448
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:12,257
Speaker 1: It's as if Someone stole your encyclopedia set.

449
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:12,879
Speaker 1: Well, think of this.

450
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,132
Speaker 1: you want to know shit all the time and now you know Nothing.

451
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:16,775
Speaker 0: scott's friend.

452
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:17,518
Speaker 0: Ian came over.

453
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:18,342
Speaker 0: We haven't seen him in a while.

454
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:20,150
Speaker 0: He's a good friend of ours and he's in the house.

455
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,853
Speaker 0: So we're like hey and we sit down and you know We have plenty to do.

456
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:30,422
Speaker 0: we played a bunch of smash brothers and some warioware went out to eat and played some board games Railroad tycoon, which alex won by a lot.

457
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:32,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were pretty much entertained all day.

458
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,800
Speaker 1: I never wanted for like.

459
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:37,739
Speaker 1: I guess I wanted for the internet But I didn't even really think about it because we're doing other shit.

460
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,103
Speaker 0: in the span of like four and a half five hours With this friend over there were at least 20 or 30 moments where?

461
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:49,907
Speaker 0: Something we were about to do was foiled by the fact that we did not have internet access.

462
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:50,730
Speaker 0: little things like.

463
00:32:51,111 --> 00:33:01,750
Speaker 0: We're talking about all the abandoned factories on the waterfront and he's really interested like oh, that sounds really cool to which I say Yeah, let me get on flickr and i'll show you the pictures.

464
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,480
Speaker 1: We're like, hey, did you see that video with the?

465
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,348
Speaker 1: you can't you can't lift 10 pokemon here?

466
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,345
Speaker 1: Let me show you this great video on youtube.

467
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:13,842
Speaker 1: Ah Borlax, yeah, and then you know, what else was it?

468
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,890
Speaker 1: It was like, oh he's talking about airsoft.

469
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:19,847
Speaker 1: So we're like, hey, let's go look up some the prices of airsoft guns in that website.

470
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:20,812
Speaker 0: You just mentioned You know what?

471
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:23,002
Speaker 1: It's probably delicious the website.

472
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:25,072
Speaker 0: You just told me about uh.

473
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:29,541
Speaker 0: And then we're talking like oh, yeah, we're gonna go to rochester for toricon.

474
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:30,564
Speaker 0: When is toricon?

475
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,169
Speaker 0: We have no way to find out.

476
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:38,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I think what it is is back in the day when the computer and the internet was less.

477
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:43,670
Speaker 1: I didn't rely on it as a you know as an external memory story.

478
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:50,650
Speaker 1: Oh just like in ghost in the shell just like in ghost in the shell now I don't remember a lot of things without the internet.

479
00:33:50,871 --> 00:34:02,669
Speaker 1: I am a much dumber person in term not in terms of being able to figure things out or you know Knowledge potential but in terms of the facts stored in my brain are much less.

480
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:08,230
Speaker 0: At least 10 or 15 of the times we wanted the internet were simply we were having an not really an argument.

481
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:13,570
Speaker 0: We were just talking about something and then the question comes up where we're not sure about one of the facts or like.

482
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:18,210
Speaker 0: I think that this building was for this and you think it was for that and we really don't know.

483
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:23,356
Speaker 0: Well, let's look it up on Wikipedia The only source of information anymore.

484
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:23,917
Speaker 0: Yeah.

485
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:24,217
Speaker 1: Yeah.

486
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:24,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

487
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:28,850
Speaker 1: It's like hey, you know, who was the guy who wrote that book?

488
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,331
Speaker 1: I don't know.

489
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:32,830
Speaker 0: Let's go find out and we have no way to get any of this information.

490
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,482
Speaker 1: It's not just stuff that we don't know yet that we need to look up.

491
00:34:35,522 --> 00:34:35,844
Speaker 1: a lot of.

492
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,210
Speaker 1: it's stuff that I did know But I just don't remember because I don't have to anymore.

493
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:50,710
Speaker 0: But here's the interesting thing and I think it speaks a lot about how much the way we live has changed Just in the last decade when the internet went from nothing to everything.

494
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:56,349
Speaker 0: Before the internet was like this people just wouldn't find out a lot of the things that we want to know.

495
00:34:56,811 --> 00:35:07,430
Speaker 0: I mean if you're living somewhere and you want to know some semi-obscure fact about someone who was a general in world war ii Your option is if you really want to know go to the library.

496
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:14,862
Speaker 0: You have to go to the library spend at least an hour researching because you're not just going to find the book that talks About this one guy immediately.

497
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,330
Speaker 0: You don't have to talk to the librarian.

498
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:29,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are some types of questions the library can answer very easily or that an encyclopedia Can answer very easily like or an almanac actually is really good for just answering questions Like what's the population of so-and-so?

499
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:33,079
Speaker 1: Uh, who was the famous guy in in this battle?

500
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:35,586
Speaker 1: who won this war, you know, when?

501
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:37,170
Speaker 1: what years did this take place?

502
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,024
Speaker 1: History, you know, what's the name of this scientific reaction?

503
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:41,124
Speaker 1: What?

504
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,530
Speaker 1: or the process of it?

505
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,937
Speaker 1: That's that's easy stuff to find.

506
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,289
Speaker 1: but like what was the name of the guy?

507
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,856
Speaker 1: In that thingy there?

508
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:51,164
Speaker 1: or you know who directed that movie?

509
00:35:51,344 --> 00:35:52,789
Speaker 1: Yeah who directed that movie?

510
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,650
Speaker 1: All right What else did he direct?

511
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,915
Speaker 1: All right, who is the actor in that?

512
00:35:57,397 --> 00:36:00,067
Speaker 1: without imdb that becomes a chore.

513
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:06,509
Speaker 0: but here's the thing That information was not readily available in our lifetime and we got on just fine without it.

514
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:11,730
Speaker 0: So our lives worked before we had this constant feed of information.

515
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:18,970
Speaker 0: Now that we are accustomed to this constant feed of information our lives slowly grind to a halt without that feed.

516
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,259
Speaker 0: Hmm i'm not i'm not.

517
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,050
Speaker 0: i really don't have anything where to go with that.

518
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,390
Speaker 0: There's too many ramifications for me to really go into a lot of depth about it's true?

519
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:27,952
Speaker 0: Oh, i'm.

520
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:36,765
Speaker 0: so i'm so dependent on this information now and while I can live without it Like I was saying before and I was a hermit for three months living in the mountains.

521
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:42,810
Speaker 0: No contact with anyone I would drive 20 minutes down the mountain to call my mom and talk for a half hour.

522
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:51,118
Speaker 0: But but during that time the only reason my life didn't collapse and I didn't just go nuts Was that one I knew it was temporary.

523
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:54,670
Speaker 0: like at the end of this time i'm moving somewhere else where I will have internet.

524
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,930
Speaker 0: And now if the internet was just down for a day or two, it'd be fine.

525
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:00,463
Speaker 0: But the fact that the internet is down indefinitely.

526
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:04,670
Speaker 0: each day that goes by I am more and more behind on what's going on in the world.

527
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:09,870
Speaker 0: And of course then again, I gotta wonder how much does me not knowing about what's going on in the world?

528
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:17,030
Speaker 0: Immediately affect me as opposed to finding out two or three days later when I watch the news or read a newspaper at work?

529
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,175
Speaker 1: I I I just don't.

530
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:26,839
Speaker 0: am I really a better person for knowing that the president of jabootie Died of colon cancer five minutes ago.

531
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,766
Speaker 0: I don't think he actually did.

532
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:29,247
Speaker 0: i'm just.

533
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:30,090
Speaker 0: that was an example.

534
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,005
Speaker 1: No, you're not because even when I have the internet I don't read those stories.

535
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:33,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

536
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:40,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't affect me not to know them just like it doesn't affect you not to know the stories I read about Computers and video games.

537
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:41,317
Speaker 0: Yeah.

538
00:37:41,337 --> 00:37:49,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time by getting all this information constantly I always feel like like knowing that x happened in jabootie doesn't really affect my life.

539
00:37:50,204 --> 00:38:01,567
Speaker 0: and knowing that barack obama said this And that john mccain said this in american politics alone don't mean anything to me or whatever's going on in france's Government right now doesn't mean anything to me.

540
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:15,210
Speaker 0: But by getting all these bits of information constantly I feel like by knowing all of them All the time i'm able to form this broad picture of the world that I really would have no way of doing before the internet.

541
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,306
Speaker 0: I don't know how it helps me, but I feel like it does.

542
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:27,366
Speaker 0: I feel like I am more aware of myself and my surroundings by having this vague cloud of information That is oftentimes relevant.

543
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:41,565
Speaker 1: surprisingly Well, I think if anything, you know without that cloud of information you start living not just in the present time But you live, you know A life only influenced by what's happening immediately around you.

544
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:54,330
Speaker 1: your perspective is very As far as your eyes can see and that's it, you know, like if you're a farmer and you work in a farm All you see is that farm and the town you work in and whatever.

545
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,426
Speaker 1: Then the way you live your life is going to be based on that town.

546
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:05,930
Speaker 1: if you're farming You know is going to be affected by something far away or maybe your farming will affect something far away.

547
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,201
Speaker 1: Or if there's going to be a competing farm in another state or something like that

548
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:21,070
Speaker 0: or like say you use this one technique of farming And people out on the internet have discovered that this technique actually destroys the soil And pollutes and is bad for the environment generally is a bad idea, but you won't know it right away.

549
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,179
Speaker 0: You won't find that out right away.

550
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,549
Speaker 0: So you wouldn't know that you're doing something bad.

551
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:31,069
Speaker 1: Yep, it's it's having just an open eye to everything that's going on.

552
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:36,410
Speaker 1: It allows you if you are smart to make your life better in many ways.

553
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:53,610
Speaker 0: Well, I guess to me the way I it's hard to describe how I feel about this But if you've ever read watchmen You know when ozzymandias is standing there and he's looking at that wall of tv screen showing every television station in the world Like all the news all the commercials everything and he doesn't watch any individual channel.

554
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:54,573
Speaker 0: He never does.

555
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:59,730
Speaker 0: he walks into the room and kind of just has the thousand yard stare looking at the wall.

556
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:18,097
Speaker 0: And by picking up all the bits and pieces from all these extraneous simultaneous real-time elements he's able to form this general understanding of like the zeitgeist of the world at that time or what's going on right now or The general direction of things to come.

557
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:27,613
Speaker 0: and that's how I feel the internet is affecting my life on a broad scale Because I feel like my scope is narrowing with each day that I don't have internet access Like I don't.

558
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:29,823
Speaker 0: there are events going on that I don't know about.

559
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:40,075
Speaker 0: so my extrapolations And my guesses and all those are becoming less and less likely to be accurate because i'm having to guess further and further out With less and less information.

560
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:43,830
Speaker 1: I definitely am having the fee the same feeling of narrowing going on.

561
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:49,530
Speaker 1: Even though I was able to go through my google reader today and delicious a bunch of things I actually stopped to read any of them.

562
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,130
Speaker 1: I pretty much tagged them expecting the internet to work when I got home, but here's the other thing.

563
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:02,110
Speaker 0: I'm, not saying that this is bad necessarily Because one thing scott and I noticed was that we got a lot done without the internet to distract us.

564
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:12,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think if it's sort of like, you know, we don't have a dryer We only have a washing machine, right if we move somewhere else or we got a dryer suddenly That would help us out a lot.

565
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:16,950
Speaker 1: not having the internet is sort of like not having a dryer after having one.

566
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:26,789
Speaker 1: It's like it was so convenient and so great and our lives are so improved or at least they felt improved by Being able to dry our clothes in our house.

567
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,950
Speaker 1: And if we go back to not having it, well right now we don't have one.

568
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,279
Speaker 1: We take our clothes to the laundromat and it still works.

569
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,848
Speaker 1: We can still live and have clean clothes but not having it is just.

570
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:44,270
Speaker 1: It just feels so worse after having it as whereas if you've never had it Then it doesn't feel so bad not to have of course.

571
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,490
Speaker 0: The other interesting thing is that without the internet we have almost no use for our computers.

572
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:56,102
Speaker 0: So until just now when I started to do the show all weekend for the most part All of our computers were off and the house was so quiet.

573
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:58,350
Speaker 0: The house was startlingly quiet.

574
00:41:58,772 --> 00:41:59,656
Speaker 0: It was unnerving.

575
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:06,767
Speaker 0: the first night I went to sleep I could hear Everything And I heard noises and I was afraid that they were something else.

576
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:07,772
Speaker 1: and I was like, okay What was that?

577
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:12,609
Speaker 0: I heard scott rolling around in his bed on the opposite side of the house.

578
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:22,230
Speaker 1: Normally all I hear when I go to bed is Occasionally did you yep, I hear computers just fans blowing constantly.

579
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:25,770
Speaker 0: No, as I was laying in bed, you don't realize how loud they are until you turn them all off.

580
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,117
Speaker 0: I heard every single car drive by on the street.

581
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:28,980
Speaker 0: I heard.

582
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,550
Speaker 1: I heard the trees rustling in the wind outside my window When I was in the bathroom, I heard the train pull into the station far away.

583
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:38,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, the train station is like three miles away.

584
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I heard the train go.

585
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:44,262
Speaker 0: dude Well, I hear that anyway, but that's because it's actually really loud.

586
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:45,246
Speaker 1: Well in my room.

587
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:46,995
Speaker 1: I don't hear it so much But yeah, it's pretty loud.

588
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:49,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, for some reason I hear it really loud in my room and I like it.

589
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,558
Speaker 0: I actually like that sound at night.

590
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:51,524
Speaker 1: It's all right.

591
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:52,249
Speaker 1: I don't mind it.

592
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,199
Speaker 0: It's a good sound to hear in the distance late at night.

593
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,330
Speaker 0: a train whistling is, you know going off.

594
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:57,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's not good.

595
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:04,150
Speaker 1: The subway is like I'm on the second floor in my building And the subway at that part of the city is like right under the street.

596
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:07,249
Speaker 1: So every like, you know a few minutes the office goes.

597
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:09,453
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not.

598
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:10,237
Speaker 0: it's like.

599
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:13,349
Speaker 0: it's like in blues brothers where they go to this apartment.

600
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,477
Speaker 1: It's not that bad, but I do.

601
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:19,050
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone else notices it because it's not really as bad as blues brothers.

602
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:19,856
Speaker 0: You get used to it.

603
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,770
Speaker 1: But yeah, I I actually still notice it.

604
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,930
Speaker 1: It's a little like a little bit of rumbliness and you can definitely tell the subways give it a month and you'll lose it.

605
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:33,898
Speaker 0: Remember I grew up with birds And to this day if i'm in a house and say someone has a bunch of birds or a bunch of dogs And the dogs just barking constantly.

606
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:34,944
Speaker 0: I don't even hear it.

607
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:36,150
Speaker 0: It doesn't even affect me at all.

608
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:39,830
Speaker 0: I could just sit in a room with dogs barking all day and it wouldn't even bother me.

609
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is maybe like.

610
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:45,832
Speaker 1: I think part of the reason dogs barking like dogs barking alone That's like.

611
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:46,998
Speaker 1: the noise doesn't bother me.

612
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:54,750
Speaker 1: But if a dog is like in the room with you barking There's a part of that bark noise that actually hurts a part of my ear and that's the part that bothers me.

613
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:55,891
Speaker 1: Like.

614
00:43:55,932 --> 00:44:01,190
Speaker 1: really I think there's something like when a dog if a dog barks loudly scott, I think that's just your parents dog.

615
00:44:01,697 --> 00:44:02,670
Speaker 1: No, there's other dogs.

616
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:10,394
Speaker 1: They all pretty much any dog barking except for like a yap dog, but any real dog that barks like bark It hurts.

617
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:11,017
Speaker 1: It hurts.

618
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:13,670
Speaker 1: Well growling is not barking but it hurts my ear.

619
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:22,908
Speaker 1: there's a part of the bark that hurts my ear like at the peak of it and I guess maybe if you keep hearing dogs bark eventually you won't be able to hear that anymore.

620
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,510
Speaker 1: It'll damage.

621
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,180
Speaker 0: I don't know that I never had that problem as a kid.

622
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:27,947
Speaker 1: Maybe your ear was damaged early.

623
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:28,289
Speaker 1: I don't know.

624
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:31,078
Speaker 0: I think you're just weird whatever.

625
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:39,490
Speaker 0: but I mean what I was saying before we got off on topic was just that On this one hot hand by not having the internet like this, you know, my my scope narrows.

626
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:49,183
Speaker 0: But on the other hand it was pleasant to have an evening an evening where I never thought I should go upstairs and see what's happening in the world is.

627
00:44:49,223 --> 00:45:02,006
Speaker 0: instead I couldn't so and I just I lived my life in the immediate present which and it was the first time i've done that in quite some time And it's almost to the point where we're thinking about maybe every friday evening.

628
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,130
Speaker 0: We just won't use the internet.

629
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:06,884
Speaker 1: well, I think what it is is just I. I find myself.

630
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:15,269
Speaker 1: I realize that I Do sit at the computer just you know when the as the default and I actually spend more time there than I think.

631
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:31,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like i'll go when I get home and go to google reader And look at all the stories which takes pretty much almost the same amount of time Almost no matter how many stories are in there and they'll be like 30 new stories But i'll still spend like 20 minutes there clicking through them.

632
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:34,656
Speaker 0: Yep, or even when we were at rit I remember this half would happen often.

633
00:45:35,037 --> 00:45:43,330
Speaker 0: if we're sitting at our computers for whatever reason and the internet's down We just keep making squares on the desktop with the selecty bit of the mouse.

634
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:48,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not so much that you know using the computer is taking up a lot of my time.

635
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:56,009
Speaker 1: It's that i'm spending a lot of time just sitting at the computer not doing anything not even really Realizing that i'm wasting a whole bunch of time.

636
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:05,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean when I first got access to the internet for that brief span of time at work this morning I used that time so efficiently it would make a german cry.

637
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:10,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I basically just have to Not keep like I go.

638
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:18,324
Speaker 1: i'll go and load up all the web comics even though i've already read them and it that I just wasting 10 minutes and maybe there'll be one new web comic.

639
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:20,090
Speaker 0: but you still look at all the rest of them.

640
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,285
Speaker 1: Yeah Why am I wasting 10 minutes of my time when I could be doing something else?

641
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:28,729
Speaker 1: and while that's not a big deal On its own you add all those up over the course of a day.

642
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:40,170
Speaker 1: I do that like five or six times or i'll scroll down dig yet again, even though there's only three new stories And I've now wasted like two hours that I could have used to do even more awesome stuff.

643
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:53,746
Speaker 1: And if you don't know, I mean look at us now We already are so efficient in our time usage even with using computers in a. you know in the way that I just described That we can make a podcast four nights a week where most people.

644
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:54,590
Speaker 1: that's insane.

645
00:46:55,031 --> 00:47:05,446
Speaker 1: so if I can manage to not if i'm not use the computer for no reason and only Do what I need to do on it and nothing else and not waste time sitting at it doing nothing.

646
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:08,490
Speaker 0: Holy crap Yep, so i'm going to try to do that.

647
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:13,990
Speaker 0: I'm very much going to pointedly not so much try to change my internet using habits, but observe them.

648
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:20,450
Speaker 0: I'm going to keep an eye on how much time I spend on the internet versus how much I get done on the internet.

649
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:28,262
Speaker 1: I'm pretty much from now on if i'm doing something on a computer that's not you know work like for work I'm gonna pay attention to what i'm doing.

650
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:28,926
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say huh?

651
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:32,590
Speaker 1: Is this something I need to do right now or am I wasting my time?

652
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,081
Speaker 1: You know, i'll make sure I only load up the web comics once a day.

653
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:39,983
Speaker 1: I'll make sure that I only you know I'll click on google reader.

654
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:49,709
Speaker 1: I'll keep it open I'll look at the number and if there aren't over 100 things in there I won't even bother looking at it because what could possibly be so urgent that it's worth spending all that time, you know, I won't.

655
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:55,410
Speaker 1: I'll go through the videos on dig once a day at home on the tv where it's more entertaining.

656
00:47:55,932 --> 00:47:57,458
Speaker 1: Now, of course get at him constantly.

657
00:47:57,538 --> 00:48:00,630
Speaker 0: the uh, the real important factor is how long do you think that's gonna last?

658
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,122
Speaker 0: The internet's gonna come back and after a week, we'll have forgotten all this.

659
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:05,910
Speaker 0: I'll just be sitting there looking at dave.

660
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:11,946
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the problem as soon as the internet comes back I'm gonna be spending a lot of time loading up this laptop, which always takes a lot of time.

661
00:48:12,027 --> 00:48:12,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's fun.

662
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,301
Speaker 0: It is that's a lot of fun.

663
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:14,583
Speaker 1: Yep.

664
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:15,126
Speaker 1: Yep.

665
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:15,288
Speaker 1: Yep.

666
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,890
Speaker 0: So yes, uh, welcome to all the new listeners and such.

667
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:31,069
Speaker 0: This is a slightly non-typical episode of geek nights due to the fact that we all as you well are aware Do not have an internet connection And are thus powerless in the face of the onslaught of information that is going right past the house.

668
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:36,269
Speaker 0: We're probably not gonna have internet for much of the rest of this week.

669
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:40,269
Speaker 0: We're not sure what we're gonna do, but suffice to say the show must go on.
