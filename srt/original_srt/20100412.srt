1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,127
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday, April 12th.

2
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:11,909
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:15,379
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight a bunch of cell phone stuff.

4
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:19,227
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:28,300
Speaker 1: So last night, you know Sunday night, usually I don't go out Sunday night, but we went to a cabaret.

6
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:32,520
Speaker 0: Really it was the ones around the corner actually no way down.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,938
Speaker 1: It's called the duplex which I I'm not sure is twice as much.

8
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:37,080
Speaker 1: It's weird.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,514
Speaker 1: There's a bar downstairs and a slightly differently crook bar Upstairs and then around the corner from the upstairs bar.

10
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:47,102
Speaker 1: There's this little cabaret Uh-huh.

11
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,146
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's so.

12
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:51,640
Speaker 1: it's little it's not it's little ish, but it was pretty cool.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:51,982
Speaker 1: It was just.

14
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:55,339
Speaker 1: it was weird to go to that thing at like 10 o'clock on a Sunday night.

15
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:01,372
Speaker 0: It was a good place to deposit all your ones not Scott cabaret does not mean strip club.

16
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:08,087
Speaker 1: I Had to say something But you know, it was awesome.

17
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,480
Speaker 1: So we get home super late and I think all right six hours of sleep.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,002
Speaker 1: I'm good.

19
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:11,784
Speaker 1: I'm good.

20
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:14,111
Speaker 1: I go to check my email gonna go to bed.

21
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,365
Speaker 1: You're called by work cuz something blew up Huh?

22
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:23,138
Speaker 1: So I Took care of it, but I didn't get woken up so I wasn't too mad to be honest.

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would if work called me.

24
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:28,947
Speaker 0: It's just like at any hour just like Yeah, it was really weird though.

25
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:29,951
Speaker 1: I was on support.

26
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:35,147
Speaker 1: Like this is the one week where they're allowed to call Yeah starting at 7 a.m.

27
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:35,489
Speaker 1: Today.

28
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:36,754
Speaker 1: I can't be called again for like a month.

29
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:37,337
Speaker 0: That's good.

30
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:38,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it works out.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,183
Speaker 1: Complain.

32
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:39,990
Speaker 0: no, it's really weird.

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:50,560
Speaker 0: I've been waking up early Naturally, like I woke up at like 6 something before the alarm went off and I wasn't tired at all And then I biked to work and I was there by 9.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,222
Speaker 1: It's just like I think you're getting extra energy from the fact that you're actually moving around Exercise.

35
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,406
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

36
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:58,108
Speaker 0: I think so.

37
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:58,791
Speaker 0: I think it.

38
00:01:58,991 --> 00:01:59,754
Speaker 0: you know, I think it is.

39
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,279
Speaker 0: I think it is the Sun.

40
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,874
Speaker 1: The Sun is far more time when the weather is fine.

41
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:05,537
Speaker 1: God.

42
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:06,260
Speaker 1: I love summer so much.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,549
Speaker 1: I'm actually rollerblading home from work every day.

44
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,959
Speaker 1: That is much more harrowing than biking.

45
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,947
Speaker 0: We're going over the same bridge, right?

46
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:15,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, that bridge is.

47
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,200
Speaker 0: so which which side do you think is worse?

48
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,020
Speaker 1: Cuz I had coming up from Manhattan is much worse because it's steeper and shorter.

49
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:29,817
Speaker 0: I think it's steeper and shorter, but then there's a long less steep part Whereas on the other side, there's a longer part that is sort of in between.

50
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,684
Speaker 0: steepness You know.

51
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,040
Speaker 0: and the thing is though like one part I do early in the morning and one part I do later.

52
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:39,685
Speaker 0: So it's like a tough, you know It's.

53
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:43,924
Speaker 0: I can't compare them with equal Factors on all sides.

54
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:44,125
Speaker 0: Yeah.

55
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:48,720
Speaker 1: Well, the real factor is gonna be when I rollerblade to work which I'm not doing yet.

56
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,440
Speaker 1: I mean, there's no shower at work or anything and rollerblading is a lot harder than biking.

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,861
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

58
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:53,543
Speaker 0: I don't get right.

59
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:54,366
Speaker 0: so you got this bridge.

60
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:55,088
Speaker 0: Okay.

61
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a big curvy suspension bridge right for cars All right.

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,465
Speaker 0: So it it's like a hill.

63
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:04,140
Speaker 1: it goes up and then down and the center is rarely in the middle of a river.

64
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,054
Speaker 0: Of course, the thing is right.

65
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:12,340
Speaker 0: the bikes and the people Why don't they make a second bridge down at the sea level that is flat?

66
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,938
Speaker 1: What do you mean at the sea level like just above the water?

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,575
Speaker 1: Thus blocking the river to boats Bridges that boats can get under.

68
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:26,482
Speaker 0: it fuck the Very least.

69
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,386
Speaker 1: I mean I do played some about Sim City.

70
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,668
Speaker 1: you put that causeway there.

71
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:30,410
Speaker 1: Those boats are fucked.

72
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:36,169
Speaker 1: Fuck the boat, I would usually I'd build roads around the boats to trap them and then kind of keep them there.

73
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:44,323
Speaker 0: Yeah At least you didn't have a really another, you know a reason that didn't make sense.

74
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:45,527
Speaker 1: I had a real reason.

75
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,830
Speaker 0: Okay Cuz it's like, you know if there were no boats, right?

76
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,707
Speaker 0: Wouldn't that be a good idea cuz then you know the people in there whatever.

77
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:56,357
Speaker 1: also Scott It's a lot harder to build a bridge like that What it only had to be a tiny bridge.

78
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:00,500
Speaker 1: the other point of the suspension bridge is that you don't need pillars in the middle Of the river.

79
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,319
Speaker 0: so much Yeah, but this you wouldn't really need pillars.

80
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:10,873
Speaker 0: You could just put it on what it's not gonna float You can just hang it for even like a rope monkey bridge, you know what hanging down from the real bridge Yeah, why not?

81
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,059
Speaker 0: It's just people and bikes.

82
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,767
Speaker 0: It's not like it has to carry a lot of weight.

83
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:18,238
Speaker 1: Ah Actually, it's cool Apparently the part where we ride the bikes and rollerblades.

84
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,844
Speaker 1: that used to be a tramway and there was a stop in the middle Over Roosevelt Island and then you would get off at that stop and get on an elevator.

85
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:26,185
Speaker 0: Yep.

86
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:27,530
Speaker 0: That's not in service anymore.

87
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:29,347
Speaker 1: No, that thing was totally dismantled.

88
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:36,204
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so I think we should get right into the news because we got kind of an exciting You know, we're doing the thing that I said we were gonna do on geek nights.

89
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,289
Speaker 1: What like two years ago?

90
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:38,616
Speaker 0: What is this thing?

91
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:39,882
Speaker 1: having a guest host?

92
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:40,606
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

93
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,657
Speaker 0: Oh shit indeed I don't know if they're.

94
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,849
Speaker 0: are they actually a guest host or is it a guest?

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,504
Speaker 1: I think guest hosts and whatever for the second half.

96
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:48,470
Speaker 1: That's that's the whole shtick.

97
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,546
Speaker 0: But anyway, I want to get right into the guest host like replace us and then we would leave.

98
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:53,450
Speaker 0: that would be a guest host.

99
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,198
Speaker 0: We're still here.

100
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,206
Speaker 0: it's their guests.

101
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,119
Speaker 0: well Maybe are we like they have to be a guest host?

102
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,388
Speaker 0: that means that we act as guests and they run the show.

103
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:08,150
Speaker 1: or are We like the late shows where the guest hosts are guest hosts because there is no real host and they keep passing it?

104
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, like yeah, like SNL has a guest host because there's a. you know, the celebrity person, you know comes out at the beginning.

105
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,064
Speaker 0: It's a different person each time, but then you're on Letterman.

106
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:21,769
Speaker 1: You're not a guest host Because the guest host is Letterman because he'll eventually pass it on to someone else.

107
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:24,929
Speaker 0: No, he's just a regular host.

108
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:26,810
Speaker 1: We'll see what kind of wing it.

109
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,222
Speaker 1: I kind of like the idea of guest hosts like we have a third host.

110
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:30,046
Speaker 1: who is the guest?

111
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:30,790
Speaker 1: because we're all equal.

112
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,101
Speaker 1: Cuz I mean who of us is the host.

113
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,793
Speaker 1: I mean me clearly me Your mom.

114
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:44,297
Speaker 1: so Google is doing something that is the host of hosts something, you know Hosanna's in the highest something like that.

115
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,250
Speaker 1: I look forward to the day when our listeners send me Hosanna's.

116
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,681
Speaker 1: I still don't know what one is but it's.

117
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,826
Speaker 0: I think it's something we don't want.

118
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:51,589
Speaker 1: I don't know.

119
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:58,932
Speaker 1: It's as far as I can tell it's nothing more than adulations Uh-huh, or maybe it's I don't know like someone's gonna send us one now And you know what?

120
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:00,864
Speaker 0: They're probably gonna send us more of those than we got.

121
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:03,856
Speaker 0: cornucopias, you know Send the cornucopia.

122
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:09,710
Speaker 0: I go make a cornucopia and just like send an email but date It's that the email gets sent on Thanksgiving, you know when the time is right.

123
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:15,388
Speaker 1: So I actually had assumed for a long time that Google did the thing that they announced that they're now doing.

124
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,764
Speaker 1: so I'm kind of Shocked but in retrospect it's obvious that they weren't doing it.

125
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:30,230
Speaker 1: because how often you search for something on Google And like the top link goes to some blog or some you know Knockoff site where someone asked the question and didn't actually answer it and it takes forever to fucking load.

126
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:34,925
Speaker 1: Google is now incorporating speed of the site as a metric in the searching.

127
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:38,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not a major metric You know, it's pretty much like order by rel.

128
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,328
Speaker 0: It's like if two sites are equal and one is faster than any other one Then the faster one will go, you know?

129
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,897
Speaker 0: Actually, no, it's not going like way.

130
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:52,915
Speaker 1: That's not what they're doing because apparently what they did affects less than 1% of queries as my guess is.

131
00:06:53,156 --> 00:07:01,504
Speaker 1: all they were doing is anytime there's a search result that is Slow beyond a certain threshold like it takes a second or so for it to respond.

132
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,090
Speaker 1: They just rank it way down.

133
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:04,636
Speaker 0: It's possible they're doing that.

134
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,543
Speaker 1: I think what they're trying to do.

135
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,155
Speaker 1: This is just me speculating is Knock off the blogs.

136
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:10,877
Speaker 1: They're useless.

137
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:13,044
Speaker 1: the forums that have questions, but not answers.

138
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,690
Speaker 1: the personal sites that are useless.

139
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,755
Speaker 0: Well, they try to do that.

140
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:18,950
Speaker 1: Anyway, this isn't you know, yeah, but I think this is they've all bet.

141
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:26,349
Speaker 1: They figured out that this metric of does the slow take the site take for fucking ever to respond is a pretty good indicator If it's a bad site or not.

142
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:27,528
Speaker 0: Well, I mean isn't you know?

143
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:34,797
Speaker 0: it happens sometimes we search for something weird on Google and you try all the links on the front page results and half of Them don't work or take forever to load.

144
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:40,650
Speaker 0: and you know, it's like the only like the fourth and eighth links You know actually load in a matter of you know quickly.

145
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,602
Speaker 0: So you really only got two results on the whole page the other results.

146
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,209
Speaker 0: So that's the reason they're doing.

147
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:48,610
Speaker 1: of course It's cool at least that the the links usually all work.

148
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,574
Speaker 1: They're just slow as hell.

149
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,739
Speaker 1: remember back in the Yahoo days.

150
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,024
Speaker 1: We're like everything just didn't work.

151
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:57,510
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I just thought this was interesting and I'm really surprised they didn't do it before and again.

152
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,810
Speaker 0: It's good that we are moving our technology around that I think our stuff is fast.

153
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,616
Speaker 1: I think so, but I don't know.

154
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:07,830
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a cool way to incorporate even more metadata like that.

155
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,981
Speaker 1: I mean the metadata about a site.

156
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:11,669
Speaker 0: I'm sure Google has this all figured out.

157
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:19,977
Speaker 1: Google did their original search engine kind of used metadata by not using what the site had so much by using what everyone else had About the site, you know linking to it.

158
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,289
Speaker 1: So maybe there's more steps of abstraction out from that.

159
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:24,458
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

160
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:25,870
Speaker 0: the search results are you know?

161
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,070
Speaker 0: The thing is they could probably makes the search results better, but they're as good as they need to be.

162
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,163
Speaker 0: It's like I don't need to be.

163
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:36,085
Speaker 1: well I use Google less and less actually because I don't need to search the internet for things.

164
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:44,270
Speaker 1: I usually need to search Wikipedia And then from there Google I only use for looking for like a very specific thing and I know exactly what I'm looking for.

165
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,906
Speaker 1: I just have to actually find it if I don't know what I'm looking for.

166
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,153
Speaker 0: I don't bother I don't serve.

167
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:51,870
Speaker 0: I think what it is is that you're using Google, but you don't even realize you're using Google.

168
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,345
Speaker 0: You know, it's one of those things where it's just so Blair.

169
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:55,070
Speaker 0: You don't even notice.

170
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:59,306
Speaker 1: Well, I use Google a lot of the times as kind of a poor man's DNS.

171
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:01,921
Speaker 1: I don't type URLs I just have the name of the site into Google.

172
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:06,580
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway So that's it's all you got there, that's all I got.

173
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,910
Speaker 0: All right, so check this out Drobo, you know Drobo.

174
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:09,767
Speaker 1: I know Drobo.

175
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,343
Speaker 1: So I remember the Drobo did not do everything that I wanted.

176
00:09:12,504 --> 00:09:18,550
Speaker 0: so the thing with Drobo Right is what they make is they make a little box That's a raid box and you put a bunch of drives in it.

177
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,438
Speaker 0: You can put any drives in there just any drives.

178
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,884
Speaker 0: just shove them in and it would.

179
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:29,410
Speaker 0: it would take care of all the raid BS you wouldn't have to deal with like Managing or rebuilding the drives or any bullshit, right?

180
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,730
Speaker 0: Totally brainless person who knows how to put a hard drive in a slot can put a bunch of drives in a Drobo.

181
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:46,209
Speaker 0: They'll have green lights and if a drive crashes it'll be a red light and you take the drive out and put a blank one in and it'll fix and you won't lose any data Unless there's too many red lights and it just works and you don't need to think about it.

182
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:50,590
Speaker 0: All right, so I was like, oh man I need one of those because I want to have a raid storage NAS thing.

183
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:52,937
Speaker 0: But I don't want to have to deal with all that raid bullshit.

184
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:59,498
Speaker 0: The thing was the Drobo right did not have any Networking whatsoever.

185
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,910
Speaker 0: It only had USB and fire.

186
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,025
Speaker 1: Did it have that fucking box you could buy that?

187
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:03,650
Speaker 0: did the networking?

188
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,090
Speaker 0: At first it had no networking.

189
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,662
Speaker 0: So you just plug it into a computer and I guess you wanted to share it.

190
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:10,235
Speaker 0: you had to you know use NFS or whatever On that computer.

191
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,383
Speaker 0: So like fuck that, right?

192
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:20,370
Speaker 0: So then Drobo came out with the Drobo share Which is a separate thing that you would attach to your Drobo and you would put the USB of the Drobo into this thing.

193
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,319
Speaker 0: And then this thing had a network hole.

194
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:23,425
Speaker 0: So it's like buying a $200 network card.

195
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,578
Speaker 0: It's like fuck that a network card is ten bucks.

196
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:27,924
Speaker 0: Fuck you, right?

197
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:29,350
Speaker 0: There's no way I was doing that.

198
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:40,890
Speaker 0: But now finally they have the Drobo FS Which is a Drobo with a network hole in it and it has a gigabit Ethernet card and it's a Drobo.

199
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:48,700
Speaker 0: so the only thing any check it can protect to drive failures at once and You can get to 10 terabytes or whatever.

200
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,530
Speaker 1: So the only thing I didn't check I'm curious about did you look how fast is it?

201
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,129
Speaker 1: Like what can I run as fast as a Drobo?

202
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:55,978
Speaker 1: Might not be fast enough.

203
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,769
Speaker 0: I mean how fast do you need to be?

204
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,235
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people want to you.

205
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:03,119
Speaker 1: like a lot of my co-workers have Drobo like things or they bought all these different Products.

206
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like.

207
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:10,830
Speaker 1: They want to use them as file servers But they also want to host services on them and kind of have it all in one.

208
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,389
Speaker 1: I'm hosting and I have storage in this one box.

209
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,130
Speaker 0: Well, I mean personally if I'm hosting a service like a database server or a web server, right?

210
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,310
Speaker 0: You don't want to do that on one of these NAS boxes because the CPU and the RAM are not enough.

211
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:27,490
Speaker 0: Get a computer get an Intel chip and some fucking RAM and do it that way.

212
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,055
Speaker 0: No, I am I'm like you could.

213
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:35,315
Speaker 0: you could connect the Drobo to such a computer right use it as the storage part All right, and go for it.

214
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:38,250
Speaker 0: The thing is the Drobo does let you write Drobo apps.

215
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,761
Speaker 0: So you could you know write a little.

216
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,930
Speaker 0: you know any you could write is basically it's Linux, right?

217
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,182
Speaker 0: So you could write something for the Drobo to like say activate, you know Maybe it doesn't have the kind of file sharing you want.

218
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:50,910
Speaker 0: So you write one you put one on there.

219
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,330
Speaker 0: You know, you can do that kind of thing, but it's not gonna be fast.

220
00:11:54,591 --> 00:12:03,390
Speaker 0: So if you're hosting any services, like maybe you could do like a cool photo gallery thing, you know But don't expect it's like host photos to the whole Internet's use flickr for that shit.

221
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:10,757
Speaker 1: But what does make me optimistic is that I believe people were talking about how it has built in already or at least kind of Preconfigured a torrent client.

222
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:13,830
Speaker 1: So you just kind of schedule up all your torrents and they're just right on the NAS.

223
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,089
Speaker 0: Yep, that's the kind of thing it can do very nicely.

224
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,727
Speaker 1: I think we're very rapidly give it another.

225
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:25,690
Speaker 1: you know - and I think the line between NAS and San is not going to be blurred but what they're completely so far away.

226
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:26,909
Speaker 1: But what's gonna happen?

227
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,848
Speaker 1: I think is that all the capabilities that sands have now are effectively going to be in the consumer.

228
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:33,330
Speaker 1: NAS is.

229
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:43,990
Speaker 1: But then what is called a San is going to be some horrifying beast far away and is already a horrifying beasts depends I mean is completely different like it some for some of the less heavy-duty stuff.

230
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:51,492
Speaker 1: We're actually, you know work we're using iSCSI and those iSCSI sands are not that expensive and they're pretty damn big tens of thousands Of dollars.

231
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:53,862
Speaker 1: you can get one for four or five thousand dollars.

232
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,488
Speaker 1: It's iSCSI with lots of space.

233
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:02,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what it really is about right is that you know, we went from computing on your desktop right to the cloud.

234
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,750
Speaker 0: I think that the real place to be is the the personal cloud.

235
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:15,170
Speaker 0: everyone has a server and the things that are blocking us from this are the people don't have enough upstream bandwidth from their ISPs and People don't have static IP addresses.

236
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:27,449
Speaker 0: I think that in the next five, I don't know not even gonna name a number of years But it's when we get IPv6 and when if we get this national broadband plan Whatever we get some upstream because it seems like they realize we need some upstream, right?

237
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,990
Speaker 0: Then people are gonna be able to have things like this drobo FS or other, you know things like Windows home server.

238
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,524
Speaker 0: Though I think those are ahead of their time, you know, they're.

239
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:37,670
Speaker 0: they're not right now.

240
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:43,550
Speaker 0: They don't work because you know It's so difficult to make all this networking with NAT routers and all this BS to get it going.

241
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:47,447
Speaker 0: But eventually when we're able to get that going that's how things are gonna be.

242
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:52,290
Speaker 0: people, you know You're gonna be able to have you know, all the stuff that you want on your own computers.

243
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,836
Speaker 0: It'll work really easily.

244
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,010
Speaker 0: You won't have to deal with weird, you know networky stuff.

245
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:07,524
Speaker 1: Well, I think the other interesting thing that'll happen once everyone has like the idea that your IP address or your connection is static That you were both that the upload and download is equal You're gonna have all.

246
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:14,550
Speaker 1: that's the you know The idea of having websites that are completely interactive because every website is running kind of on someone's PC.

247
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine with IPv6, right?

248
00:14:16,197 --> 00:14:17,020
Speaker 0: You could have a cell phone.

249
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,849
Speaker 0: That is the same IP address no matter where you go.

250
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:20,450
Speaker 0: That'd be freaking awesome.

251
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:30,020
Speaker 1: well imagine the idea of I'm hosting a website that is actually on my phone being served to the world from it live and The information about what I'm doing is there.

252
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,668
Speaker 1: and if I browse to like your phone I can see what you're doing and we can have like this dynamic data and information sharing.

253
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,795
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm All kinds of crazy stuff is gonna happen.

254
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,943
Speaker 1: So that's all kind of Kurzwaldian convergence future.

255
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:45,335
Speaker 0: No, but I mean, you know Kurt's Waldy And who's Kurt's Wald?

256
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,710
Speaker 0: It's Kurt's while and he's crazy.

257
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,030
Speaker 0: But the yeah, the drobo FS is that kind of thing?

258
00:14:52,232 --> 00:15:01,650
Speaker 0: so that's you know, if I if I start running out of see I think is I have more storage now because I got a one terabyte drive in the Home theater PC and a one terabyte in the desktop and a whole bunch of other drives.

259
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:06,734
Speaker 0: but if I start running low on the storage or maybe what I'll do is you know, I'll I'll get.

260
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:12,889
Speaker 0: I can get one of these when I get a bunch of extra money and Buy a couple drives stick them in there and put all my extra drives in there, too.

261
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:16,990
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, I just have one and then put solid states in the computers.

262
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:23,330
Speaker 1: See I'm holding off right now, but I plan to buy something like that soon basically to be the permanent media archive for geek nights.

263
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:25,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, we definitely need something like that for my personal stuff.

264
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:26,770
Speaker 1: I don't need it that much.

265
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,650
Speaker 1: I mean my computer can host all the data.

266
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:31,764
Speaker 1: I can put a separate little secure raid.

267
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:32,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's.

268
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:37,658
Speaker 0: the other problem Is that when you have a desktop computer right you can just shove a bunch of drives in it and you're like well What the hell do I you know?

269
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,652
Speaker 1: Yep, and I need backups But you know what?

270
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:45,252
Speaker 1: a one terabyte external eyes like scuzzy like external SATA drive crazy cheap I think.

271
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:52,381
Speaker 0: what though it's good for right is let's say you have all laptops or iPads and phones But you don't want any desktops Yep.

272
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,098
Speaker 0: Then you get one of these babies.

273
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,210
Speaker 0: shove it in the corner and you are rocking the house.

274
00:15:56,953 --> 00:16:00,850
Speaker 0: Connect your laptop to the TV and you can load up a zillion videos.

275
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,070
Speaker 1: You know where else is great college dorms and places where many geeks live together.

276
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,507
Speaker 0: You just get like one for like, you know half a floor college dorm.

277
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:13,850
Speaker 1: you all get together Like if you're in one of those computer science house kind of things you all pitch in like with your club.

278
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 1: Buy one and you just everyone who moves into the floor inherits the ever-growing data set Oh shit, which is primarily porn and mp3s.

279
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,770
Speaker 0: I just said the one kid who's got mad money can copy the whole thing.

280
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:26,655
Speaker 0: What when he leaves?

281
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:29,630
Speaker 1: but maybe alumni you you set up a kind of secret deal.

282
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:33,887
Speaker 1: Alumni have the right to come back with their own drobo and just copy the whole thing.

283
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:43,015
Speaker 1: Yeah So things of the day.

284
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:50,809
Speaker 1: this was shown to us by the right honorable Lord Darryl Surratt at anime hell at anime, Boston And I should say this for Wednesday.

285
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:54,081
Speaker 1: I had not seen it before and I could have saved it for Wednesday as Scott pointed out.

286
00:16:54,122 --> 00:17:01,610
Speaker 1: but in the interest of cross-pollination I think anyone can enjoy this now in case you can't tell us have some technology to it.

287
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,239
Speaker 1: This guy is clearly taking the piss.

288
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,410
Speaker 1: He still cracks himself up toward the end.

289
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:13,666
Speaker 1: He is definitely doing this for humor and this is not legitimate, but this is some of the funniest shit.

290
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,529
Speaker 1: I've seen in a while.

291
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,377
Speaker 1: Basically, I don't really want to spoil it.

292
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:20,690
Speaker 1: But basically the premise is a young man a young anime fan.

293
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:27,940
Speaker 1: He likes his soul eater and his bleach and his Naruto which is you know, that's kind of that's the popular anime fan And a lot of anime fans forget that.

294
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,510
Speaker 1: that's the kind of stuff that gets people in.

295
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,950
Speaker 0: But anyway, the thing is I've seen like, you know for up, you know Actually, I saw like 13 episodes Naruto and four of bleach.

296
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,907
Speaker 0: So I think I had to watch like four or so leaders just just to know what it.

297
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:43,830
Speaker 1: what it's about It bothers me because I like the style of so leaders so much that I want to like the show.

298
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:50,790
Speaker 0: I'm so desperately afraid that is just gonna be fighting after like 10 episodes probably but I'm just gonna see the dealers.

299
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:56,390
Speaker 1: There's this upstanding young gentleman wanted to watch his soul leader and a few minutes in it was not so.

300
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:59,049
Speaker 1: But it was in fact the Rick roll the Rick roll.

301
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,978
Speaker 1: You just got to watch this to see what I mean.

302
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,344
Speaker 1: This is frickin hilarious.

303
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:04,208
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

304
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,335
Speaker 1: That's good It's up there.

305
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:06,645
Speaker 1: It's not a college humor.

306
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:14,950
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, so anyway, I was just discussing this a minute ago, huh coincidence my news and thing of the day are related, right?

307
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,830
Speaker 0: There's a problem lately with you know, the fact that we don't get static IP addresses and dynamic DNS is shaky, right?

308
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:37,830
Speaker 0: so if you want to do something like I don't know host a game server so that people can connect to it and you get your game on like when Left 4 Dead or your NS or something or maybe you want to send a file from directly from your computer to your friend's computer across the internet or Anything like this, right?

309
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,270
Speaker 0: You've got to like open up ports on your router and then sometimes that doesn't work, right?

310
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,397
Speaker 0: And UPnP is just a disaster.

311
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:53,849
Speaker 0: and there's all this stuff and it's a huge pain in the butt and people, you know Sometimes the guy on the other end doesn't know how to do it or it doesn't work or his routers weird and you know It used to be the back in the day.

312
00:18:54,131 --> 00:19:01,370
Speaker 0: You know people would just connect directly to each other over the internet with no problem because people didn't use routers people did just plug.

313
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,270
Speaker 1: It's not because most people who were playing these games didn't have static IPS.

314
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:07,370
Speaker 1: Even then they got a dynamic IP from like their cable modem.

315
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:10,490
Speaker 1: The only time it was easy is when you're on an IPX fucking LAN.

316
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:14,163
Speaker 1: Yeah that too or you're using some sort of crazy multiple modem dial.

317
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:15,890
Speaker 0: the thing is it used to be easier, you know.

318
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:23,530
Speaker 0: And now I take it Having been easier nowadays, right you got Skype which has to do like some crazy nap busting by connect.

319
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,152
Speaker 0: You know it.

320
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:34,070
Speaker 0: basically there's the middleman Skype server and you talk to it and the other guy talks to it and then it hooks You up, you know, it's like a matchmaker and that's the way that they get around this stuff and that's why Skype works.

321
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,402
Speaker 0: Otherwise Skype would not work at all.

322
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:40,448
Speaker 0: So The thing is a huge pain in the ass and you don't want to have this middleman, right?

323
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,850
Speaker 0: This is why the thing that bothers me the most is now we have things like, you know, mega upload.

324
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:51,375
Speaker 0: You're right pretty much that routers are keeping mega upload in business right, so What can we do?

325
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,725
Speaker 0: and some guys came up with this somewhat ingenious solution.

326
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:56,490
Speaker 0: they pronounce it po-net.

327
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:57,815
Speaker 1: I continue.

328
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:07,290
Speaker 0: I will till the day I die pronounce potent the way I first pronounced it when I discovered the word Yes, I will pronounce it po-net and basically what it is is a proxy server that works behind a net.

329
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:14,090
Speaker 0: So in other words, they do some crazy magic right that rim could explain and I only half understand it.

330
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:27,117
Speaker 1: Basically, they use a clever trick of one side is pinging an IP address that clearly does not exist and from and it associates with a certain port and then the other side Tries to connect to the external IP address of one.

331
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:41,423
Speaker 1: as long as one party knows the other party's external IP at all then you're all in business and it pulls some shenanigans and basically both parties discover each other's external IPs and Then use this clever trick to establish a connection and then you're good.

332
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:44,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's a proxy server So it can proxy anything.

333
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:51,697
Speaker 0: So you basically get the pone at hooked up and then you can send anything over it once it's you know Going and I tested it and it worked.

334
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:56,194
Speaker 0: I got two virtual machines on two different nets Talk to each other.

335
00:20:56,234 --> 00:21:00,870
Speaker 1: it uses some ICMP shenanigans that could a smart network admin could prevent.

336
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,225
Speaker 0: It's probably not gonna work in your office, but you know where it's gonna work.

337
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:07,110
Speaker 0: three links is yeah It's gonna work through the links is just fine.

338
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:15,430
Speaker 0: So if you're at home and your friends at home and you want to send them a file Right or you know, you're at home and your friends at home and you don't want to use hamachi to play a game.

339
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:16,309
Speaker 1: See now this is it.

340
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,426
Speaker 1: All we have to do is combine put ahead with all the functionality that waste was supposed to give us.

341
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:22,650
Speaker 0: That's my plan.

342
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,438
Speaker 0: Right, so you just get an SCP.

343
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,487
Speaker 1: Oh, it's your thing of the day is Scottish you're talking.

344
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:36,950
Speaker 0: Yeah No, but the thing of the day is the pun at itself, but you know This could be used right to just get people connect to each other get the encrypted file transfer going on.

345
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:43,894
Speaker 0: So this is pretty awesome and I'm gonna see, you know, if it continues to work and they continue to work on it I mean, it's open source.

346
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:44,859
Speaker 0: I'm gonna see what I can do.

347
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:47,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, eventually I'm working on the website.

348
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,085
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play with it a little bit and see if you could.

349
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,118
Speaker 1: you know My network my knowledge of networking.

350
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:55,070
Speaker 1: I'll bet we could make it a little bit better have so, you know It relies on that one IP address.

351
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:59,590
Speaker 1: I feel like you could set up some sort of seated rotation of the IP address to make it even better.

352
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,212
Speaker 0: All right.

353
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,998
Speaker 0: Now before we do the main bit.

354
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,683
Speaker 0: I haven't met a moment met a moment.

355
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:04,948
Speaker 1: We almost forgot.

356
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,475
Speaker 0: so Here are some items.

357
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,423
Speaker 1: number one book club is cosmos.

358
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,194
Speaker 0: book club is cosmo Sagan.

359
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:16,350
Speaker 0: read it We're giving you some extra time mostly because I'm waiting for him to finish reading so I can get that copy.

360
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,030
Speaker 1: I don't want to buy a copy of cosmos.

361
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:18,914
Speaker 0: I've been by.

362
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:21,225
Speaker 0: I just keep forgetting to buy it when I order other shit on Amazon.

363
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:31,449
Speaker 0: the Anyone who like applied to the forums recently if you did not get an email approving you saying like yes You are in the forum.

364
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,859
Speaker 0: Well, guess what you're in and you just didn't get the email.

365
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:37,897
Speaker 0: so go to the forum and just sign in with whatever your password Was and you'll be all right.

366
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:42,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I moved the forum to a new server So it should be faster now and the email should be working.

367
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,329
Speaker 0: so if the email from the forum isn't working when you know from now on let me know because it's a problem.

368
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:54,182
Speaker 0: and Also rim, I would like you to go now on your computer to shop.

369
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:54,865
Speaker 0: front row crew.

370
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:56,450
Speaker 0: calm and tell me what you see there.

371
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:59,945
Speaker 1: Is it gonna be a picture of me failing in some way?

372
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:00,387
Speaker 1: Let's see.

373
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:00,990
Speaker 1: front row crew.

374
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can just click on the shop.

375
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,460
Speaker 0: you could you could do that as well.

376
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:11,111
Speaker 1: You're my fancy a dos keyboard Mm-hmm.

377
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:14,150
Speaker 1: All right for a crew that comes loading kind of slow, but that's fine.

378
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to move that to.

379
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,961
Speaker 0: I'm gonna move that to another new server.

380
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:17,945
Speaker 0: It'll be faster then.

381
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,937
Speaker 0: not bad How you like that.

382
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:20,846
Speaker 0: not bad at all?

383
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,597
Speaker 1: Thing is I might we'll see.

384
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:26,226
Speaker 1: I'm looking at to pay to code to cover my ass.

385
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:26,909
Speaker 0: We'll see.

386
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:30,248
Speaker 0: I don't know How that rolls.

387
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:37,630
Speaker 1: But yeah, the worst thing is I have a like 80% functional magento running on my laptop in a VM.

388
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:42,963
Speaker 1: Good job thing is it wasn't 100% and it was open to fraud as I figured out.

389
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:44,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, good job.

390
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:44,889
Speaker 0: All right.

391
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,736
Speaker 0: Anyway Does that cover the meta moment?

392
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:48,157
Speaker 1: Yep.

393
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:50,386
Speaker 1: We don't have any big cons coming up kinetic on.

394
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:54,926
Speaker 1: if you want to do a panel at Kinetic on we're in charge and we're looking for tech panels.

395
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:55,650
Speaker 1: Not just anime.

396
00:23:55,831 --> 00:24:06,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're looking for anything that is any geekery even if it's like an offside, you know If you want to do it a panel about like car modifications about Frickin, I don't know model train.

397
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,157
Speaker 0: if you know Lego panel would be cool.

398
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:12,490
Speaker 1: You can think of someone cool that you think we should invite to kinetic on as a guest.

399
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:13,232
Speaker 1: Let us know.

400
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:16,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, and don't like, you know aim too high.

401
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:16,484
Speaker 0: Don't be like.

402
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:18,290
Speaker 0: hey bring Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

403
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,901
Speaker 0: It's like dude, don't even bother them.

404
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:21,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

405
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:22,428
Speaker 0: what else can we do?

406
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:27,885
Speaker 0: You know give us like, you know reasonable things, you know, that'll help.

407
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:29,170
Speaker 0: and it would also help.

408
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,070
Speaker 0: You know, if like if you email these people yourself, you know If there's someone you know or I'd be like ribbon Scott.

409
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:43,020
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cool If there's someone you have a better connection to right don't just tell us hey get this person right try to you know Introduce us to that person through you if you're closer to them.

410
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,923
Speaker 0: That's how this thing work.

411
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,870
Speaker 1: is that makes you awesome, right?

412
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,046
Speaker 0: Alright, so for the first time in like a century we have a guest on the geek nice host.

413
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,555
Speaker 0: No, we're still.

414
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,970
Speaker 0: we're still discussing whether it's a guest host or not, I think it's a guest host.

415
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:07,790
Speaker 0: Anyway, our guest host here is our friend and now Emily's co-worker who she seems to be really good at turning friends in the co-workers.

416
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:09,575
Speaker 0: Conrad what's up?

417
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:10,438
Speaker 0: Hello everybody.

418
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:10,979
Speaker 2: How's it going?

419
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,527
Speaker 1: So Conrad is a technological wizard.

420
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:14,590
Speaker 1: We've known him for a long time.

421
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:18,808
Speaker 1: He's kind of an expert in his field kind of kind of please.

422
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,009
Speaker 0: I I'm pretty sure he's better at coding than me.

423
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,310
Speaker 0: I mean he went to work at like AMD and stuff and I went to work with like, you know, I did that.

424
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I probably wouldn't be able to do that job.

425
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,448
Speaker 2: It actually they had me doing a PHP web development.

426
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:33,010
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

427
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,876
Speaker 0: Okay, I thought you were doing like.

428
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:38,228
Speaker 2: well, actually I got to do a little bit of the SIMD intrinsic program.

429
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,715
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, that's why I could.

430
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:40,800
Speaker 0: I could have done the PHP.

431
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,990
Speaker 0: I couldn't have done the whatever else you were talking about.

432
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,795
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, that's actually where I taught myself PHP and HTML and CSS which led me down an awful freelance The.

433
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:51,770
Speaker 2: the moral of the story here is don't go to work for AMD.

434
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,077
Speaker 2: No, that's not the moral of the story.

435
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:55,670
Speaker 2: The moral of the story is don't go to work doing freelance web development.

436
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:57,196
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the real story.

437
00:25:57,738 --> 00:25:58,662
Speaker 1: It's such a jungle.

438
00:25:58,702 --> 00:25:59,526
Speaker 1: I couldn't deal with it.

439
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:00,530
Speaker 2: It's awful, man.

440
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:12,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know It has been in great demand for an incredibly long amount of time for us to do some sort of show about you know telome phones and It seems that with the news that is about lately notice.

441
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,210
Speaker 0: We avoided any cell phone news during the news part of the show.

442
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:16,475
Speaker 1: I had like three.

443
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,484
Speaker 0: we got three tech people on the show.

444
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:19,810
Speaker 0: We got hot cell phone news.

445
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,339
Speaker 0: I think that's what we should talk about.

446
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:22,929
Speaker 0: So let us begin right?

447
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,990
Speaker 0: I think a good way to get started is a little question here.

448
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:32,450
Speaker 0: If you could just if you had no contract and you could buy any phone right today in the United States, right?

449
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,133
Speaker 0: What do you do?

450
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:36,910
Speaker 1: So am I going to get a contract when I buy the phone?

451
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,622
Speaker 0: Well, I mean no you can give it.

452
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:39,550
Speaker 0: you have a clean slate.

453
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,610
Speaker 0: You could do anything that is, you know, actually available.

454
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:43,717
Speaker 0: So you could get a contract.

455
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:45,690
Speaker 0: I'm saying like you could go get something from boost mobile.

456
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,694
Speaker 0: You could do whatever you want.

457
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,601
Speaker 1: all the stuff I want is on the horizon.

458
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:49,383
Speaker 1: So I would wait.

459
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:50,929
Speaker 1: I'd wait about four months.

460
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,190
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, he brings up a good case right now the market.

461
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:57,310
Speaker 2: I mean, there's some good stuff out there, right?

462
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,201
Speaker 2: The Motorola droids been tearing it up a little bit.

463
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:03,020
Speaker 2: the palm pre plus is pretty good But there's definitely a lot of stuff coming up.

464
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,550
Speaker 2: That is it would make it worth holding out for two months.

465
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:16,916
Speaker 2: that said if I had to go and get a new phone today because I I'm rocking the HTC droid Eris, which I really want to get a new phone today So well, we got a good coverage here.

466
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:18,181
Speaker 0: I got an iPhone 3G.

467
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:21,855
Speaker 0: All right, he's got the Android rims got the Free so we.

468
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:25,830
Speaker 0: the only thing we haven't covered is like Windows Mobile Blackberry, but I've had Blackberry in the past.

469
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:26,857
Speaker 1: I have a Blackberry.

470
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got a Blackberry for work.

471
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,370
Speaker 1: I turned it off cuz I don't want to screw up the audio.

472
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:30,671
Speaker 1: So we got.

473
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:34,486
Speaker 0: we have pretty good coverage here in terms of you know, knowing what's up.

474
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:40,268
Speaker 1: I think what bothers me I think we can all agree on this that there's no phone that does everything like every one of them has.

475
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:40,870
Speaker 1: it's not just like.

476
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,095
Speaker 1: They're all kind of mediocre.

477
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:45,469
Speaker 1: Everyone has a fatal flaw, but they all have fatal flaws.

478
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:51,025
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm quite I mean the pre is kind of a. the hardware broke immediately.

479
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:52,047
Speaker 1: This is my second one.

480
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:52,809
Speaker 1: It's only been a year.

481
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:54,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know the iPhone.

482
00:27:54,777 --> 00:28:07,217
Speaker 0: it's like I had this great interface, but it's like all the apps cost frickin money You know and any you know I mean like the meebo app for instant messaging didn't come out until very very recently and until then I was pretty much suffering with No instant messaging whatsoever, right?

483
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:10,570
Speaker 0: I can't do more than one exchange account at a time and all this other stuff.

484
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:16,322
Speaker 0: You know iPhone 4 is gonna like fix a lot of these problems But it still has the problem of I can't do anything with it.

485
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:17,427
Speaker 1: What about the drawer though?

486
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:17,889
Speaker 1: Isn't the droid?

487
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:18,170
Speaker 1: Perfect?

488
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,714
Speaker 2: No, not quite the opposite.

489
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:26,336
Speaker 2: In fact, I just wrote it was a five or six page article on my blog that basically Itemizes the problem with Android.

490
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:26,919
Speaker 2: most notably.

491
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:32,250
Speaker 2: you can do everything with it and it lets you do everything Which is actually a bad idea for a cell phone.

492
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:35,250
Speaker 2: When you try to run six seven applications at once.

493
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:40,130
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're looking at terrible slowdowns laggy interface bad battery life literally.

494
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,843
Speaker 0: But I mean, but all these apps are written in Java right running in like a VM.

495
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:45,710
Speaker 2: So it's a cut down version of Java.

496
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:49,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I mean if they were written like straight to the like an ARM assembly, right?

497
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:50,830
Speaker 0: Maybe wouldn't have the problems.

498
00:28:50,850 --> 00:29:01,890
Speaker 2: you know, I mean I think if even the the VM included like just-in-time compilation and like hot code pass code path caching I think that it we would see substantial improvements.

499
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,741
Speaker 0: I think that's what iPhone does right.

500
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:05,230
Speaker 0: the iPhone has like the LLVM.

501
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,399
Speaker 2: Yeah, the LLVM dynamically optimizes.

502
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,909
Speaker 2: it dynamically optimizes compiled code Whereas we don't even have a just-in-time compiler in Android yet.

503
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:21,770
Speaker 1: So I think more of the problem is just the developers making very kind of far-reaching 80% solutions to everything as opposed to making a very focused slick solution.

504
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:27,410
Speaker 2: Yeah Google in particular is actually like the first party in this case is the most at fault in my opinion and you look at it.

505
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:32,330
Speaker 2: For example, I want you to go into your gmail app right now and copy and paste something out of an email.

506
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:38,426
Speaker 1: Actually, that was fine on the pre because it comes with its own Built-in mail app that does Gmail perfectly.

507
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:48,010
Speaker 0: Well on this iPhone I can go into the actual mail app, which I have hooked up to Copy paste or I can go to Gmail's website in mobile Safari and copy paste.

508
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,170
Speaker 2: Yeah, technically I could go to the website, but I mean, it's it's a Google phone.

509
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,070
Speaker 2: I have a Gmail app and yet you can't copy text out of an email not even in reply mode.

510
00:29:57,492 --> 00:30:01,530
Speaker 1: So, you know the only reason by the Google phone is because I have all Google stuff.

511
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,586
Speaker 1: So I want to go all in with Google, but the Google works better on the pre In some cases.

512
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:14,808
Speaker 2: Yeah also I might I might add that I actually bought an application to scrape my Google reader feed because Google didn't release any kind of reader application.

513
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:22,830
Speaker 2: and Meanwhile, you'll all be very pleased to know that they integrated buzz into maps so you can find out who is buzzing in your neighborhood.

514
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:29,430
Speaker 0: If I could use well, I mean if you look at the iPhone right some of the best apps are actually like Google stuff.

515
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:32,190
Speaker 0: Right, like the mail is only awesome because it's Google in there.

516
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,290
Speaker 0: You can even hook up to Google through exchange, you know with the active sync in the iPhone mail app.

517
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:41,289
Speaker 0: Right, you have the actual Google app with the voice search action going on.

518
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:43,850
Speaker 0: You know the Google Maps and the iPhone is friggin great.

519
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,357
Speaker 0: We know what Apple Maps give me.

520
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:46,322
Speaker 0: you know, that doesn't exist.

521
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:48,090
Speaker 0: and if it did give me a break, right?

522
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:53,890
Speaker 0: The thing is this Google Maps doesn't really get updated ever, you know Like it doesn't have the bicycle directions.

523
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,684
Speaker 0: I have to go to the web to get the bicycle direction because that's a new feature.

524
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:58,112
Speaker 2: mine doesn't have them either though That's a new.

525
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:00,690
Speaker 0: it's a new feature on the real Google Maps on the website.

526
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:02,910
Speaker 1: I gotta see if mine does and this is the problem.

527
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:03,633
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like.

528
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:06,343
Speaker 0: all I really need is I used mostly Google stuff.

529
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,050
Speaker 0: Like I live on Google in my web browser.

530
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,510
Speaker 0: So all I really need is a phone that is like just as awesome as the Google web pages.

531
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:14,615
Speaker 0: But it doesn't.

532
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:15,599
Speaker 0: it just doesn't.

533
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:18,150
Speaker 0: it's like a poor facsimile of the Google web pages.

534
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:35,809
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know as you know coming from Android I hate to say it, but I echo that sentiment, you know It's getting better though, you know particularly in the Android scene, you know in the interest of full disclosure I'm running 2.1 on the Aris using the weak OTA.

535
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:40,930
Speaker 2: Well, you know 1.5 which this device ships with is literally insufferable.

536
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:48,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have a co-worker who switched from the 1.5 on his on his Samsung moment to have sung moment.

537
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:49,934
Speaker 0: The moment is like.

538
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,106
Speaker 0: this is like a low-end Android device you can get from Sprint.

539
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,350
Speaker 0: they're coming out of digital abortion.

540
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:57,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're coming out with the moment - he liked it though Cuz it had a keyboard.

541
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:58,750
Speaker 0: where it's like the Aris doesn't have the keyboard.

542
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,229
Speaker 0: He wanted the physical keyboard and you know, honestly, it does have the nicest physical keyboard.

543
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, like nicer than the droid one even.

544
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,889
Speaker 2: yeah, I was really unimpressed with the droid keyboard.

545
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:08,957
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean I own an Aris which should tell you.

546
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but the the thing is he up.

547
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:16,179
Speaker 0: he did at you know, the hack upgrade 2.5 and It like.

548
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,290
Speaker 0: he lost all his contacts.

549
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,410
Speaker 0: But because it was syncing with Google contacts all the contacts on the phone were erased.

550
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:24,862
Speaker 0: Then it synced and erased all his Google contacts on Google.

551
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:28,077
Speaker 2: that actually really surprises me because during my flash It was quite the opposite.

552
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,150
Speaker 2: it, you know, everything was pushed up to Google.

553
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:37,144
Speaker 2: So when I flashed my phone, it just pulled all my contacts back from Google and I was like, oh well That was a pleasant surprise and I use an HTC phone.

554
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,270
Speaker 2: So it hooks up with Facebook.

555
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:43,614
Speaker 2: So if I'm friends with you on Facebook, I automatically have your phone number added to my my thing which is More than once.

556
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:50,768
Speaker 2: yeah HTC in my opinion like they provide like a best-in-class interface You you can't do better on Android than HTC.

557
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:51,110
Speaker 2: sense.

558
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:51,572
Speaker 1: See.

559
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,745
Speaker 1: the thing is though with my pre it kind of it's weird.

560
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,443
Speaker 1: on the apps the app There's no App Store.

561
00:32:55,565 --> 00:33:00,070
Speaker 1: on the pre I would basically say there's no app worth getting on a web OS except like the Twitter app.

562
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:07,737
Speaker 1: But so sad came with everything like the Google Maps and all this stuff came with it and is built in and supported by The company.

563
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,049
Speaker 1: that's not going to exist anymore.

564
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:20,830
Speaker 1: Well, I I think that they will exist, you know, obviously today they were announced that they're up for sale We have which I think was a preemptive move because they they want people to buy them, but they want it to be a war.

565
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,508
Speaker 1: They don't want Google to be like, alright, that's your stock price for buying you.

566
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:29,732
Speaker 0: See the thing is I think I get the feeling Google's just really stupid like I you know Like.

567
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:31,962
Speaker 0: in some ways Google is geniuses like the search engine.

568
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,830
Speaker 0: only geniuses could make that thing work, right?

569
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,569
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, they're morons Like why does their UI suck like they have so much money, right?

570
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,464
Speaker 0: They couldn't they just hire someone and make a better UI than Apple code.

571
00:33:43,544 --> 00:33:44,408
Speaker 0: Well, look at what I can.

572
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:44,830
Speaker 0: they do it.

573
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:45,836
Speaker 1: Look what happened to web.

574
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:46,962
Speaker 0: Oh, there's that geniuses.

575
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,150
Speaker 0: How come their UI sucks?

576
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,180
Speaker 1: They just got formal at former Apple people instead do something similar.

577
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,730
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when they did it they did it expertly.

578
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,598
Speaker 2: Palms web OS is beautiful.

579
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:56,282
Speaker 2: It's incredibly.

580
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:57,910
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, the hardware is a little flaky.

581
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the durability of like the iPhone or anything like but like navigating through this thing and just using the phone.

582
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:13,630
Speaker 1: I think it's far and away the best interface Multitasking implementation far in a way Five apps at the same time and tab between them with no trouble.

583
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,570
Speaker 2: You know, it's and that's the important part is the the ability to control what apps are running.

584
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,100
Speaker 2: This is a glaring omission from Android style.

585
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,610
Speaker 2: Obviously, you can go and download a task management.

586
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:27,121
Speaker 2: Right, but I consider like you want to talk about an 80% solution.

587
00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:34,574
Speaker 2: Yeah downloading a third-party application that lets you manage Windows solution right there Something Windows doesn't have.

588
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:37,346
Speaker 0: I know I'll go get something else to clog up my system tray.

589
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:38,290
Speaker 1: get the power tool.

590
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:43,070
Speaker 1: I actually like how a lot of people are running that hack on the iPhone that basically gives you the cards that web OS has.

591
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:45,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really hacked together in shoddy way.

592
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:45,947
Speaker 2: I just saw it yesterday.

593
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:51,590
Speaker 2: actually It's nice to have it but and yeah, like cards the best the best implementation of multitasking on a mobile device.

594
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,409
Speaker 1: I'm really excited about who's gonna end up getting palm because someone's gonna get palm, right?

595
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,490
Speaker 0: But I mean it's like so ideally right Google would get palm.

596
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:03,090
Speaker 0: They would put the palm guys on the task of making a brand new Android UI which doesn't suck ass.

597
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,348
Speaker 1: No, they should drop Android take web OS and just extend it.

598
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:09,428
Speaker 0: No, cuz they already Android has a lot more apps for it and everything.

599
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:13,383
Speaker 2: All right Yeah, I'll go 50/50 with you there web OS is HTML CSS based.

600
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:16,674
Speaker 2: So there's literally no reason why you could Build a layer.

601
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,570
Speaker 0: they could get the the web OS apps to run on the Android.

602
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,189
Speaker 0: I mean, they're both Linux at the bottom, right?

603
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,753
Speaker 0: You can merge them.

604
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:28,330
Speaker 0: the thing is in merging them would Google actually allow them to take the UI where they needed to go?

605
00:35:28,651 --> 00:35:34,496
Speaker 0: Because I read this blog post where you know is a story about this guy who went to work on Google to like do the UI.

606
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:35,530
Speaker 0: he was the UI genius.

607
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:49,630
Speaker 0: You know that supposedly would fix everything and apparently Google was doing all this stupid shit that pissed him off like they had to test like 40 different shades of blue and they actually collected like a B tested all of them against each Other and all this crazy stuff that like drove him insane.

608
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,273
Speaker 0: So he left.

609
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:56,181
Speaker 1: dude, you got to focus on the gestures working before you worry about what shade of blue I know and I mean look at like it's.

610
00:35:56,482 --> 00:36:03,270
Speaker 0: it's all these little things that people Don't realize you know, like look on the palm pre one thing that it does that actually beats.

611
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,717
Speaker 0: The iPhone is like the camera.

612
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:05,904
Speaker 0: you could push the button.

613
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:10,397
Speaker 0: It just takes a picture immediately like Yeah I can double tap like diggity-diggity.

614
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,601
Speaker 1: It's like picture picture picture picture.

615
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:14,150
Speaker 2: Yeah, my device is also incredibly slow.

616
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,817
Speaker 0: I was in the eyes right a slow iPhone.

617
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:17,042
Speaker 0: I pushed the take picture button.

618
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:21,390
Speaker 0: It's like chick-chick Chick-chick and then there's a picture has been taken.

619
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:23,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know about but I mean the.

620
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,222
Speaker 0: you know the.

621
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:29,743
Speaker 0: the iPhone especially in the iPod Department is what really has a lot of things that no one else can do.

622
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:33,183
Speaker 0: the media playing at everything else Good for a little while.

623
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:36,082
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, but I mean think about this right?

624
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:37,350
Speaker 0: It's the same old thing.

625
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:42,223
Speaker 0: How many years have I been asking for this feature on any device other than an iPod?

626
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,570
Speaker 0: you start listening to a podcast on?

627
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,320
Speaker 0: iTunes you sync you press play on your iPod.

628
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,585
Speaker 0: it picks up where you left off.

629
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,710
Speaker 0: you sync back to iTunes.

630
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:50,836
Speaker 0: It picks up where you left off.

631
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,245
Speaker 0: Does the Zune do that?

632
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:53,190
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

633
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,381
Speaker 2: I haven't used one or tested it out but actually I wonder if I had to pick a candidate device that would be.

634
00:36:57,421 --> 00:37:01,116
Speaker 0: the Zune is probably the only thing and I Don't even know for sure if it does it.

635
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:03,810
Speaker 0: and then even if it does it only did it recently, right?

636
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:14,125
Speaker 0: Well, then I pod has been doing it since the iPod mini in 1990 like when I was in college, okay So, you know these kinds of small detailed things pick up on this.

637
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,550
Speaker 0: every device should do all this stuff.

638
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:22,880
Speaker 2: It's a double-edged sword because that kind of control you're talking about comes at a level of Integration that not many other companies are prepared to offer.

639
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,490
Speaker 2: and part of that integration part of the price you pay for that integration I think is the closed nature of the device.

640
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:35,728
Speaker 1: necessarily He's got a good point because look at this the iPhone the most closed has kind of the slickest everything going on.

641
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,656
Speaker 1: at least the things That's the most well like you're playing.

642
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:38,178
Speaker 1: Yeah.

643
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,105
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, look at the Windows 7 phones coming out.

644
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:42,113
Speaker 1: They're less closed I think than Apple.

645
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,683
Speaker 1: at least they're going to be less closed and they're not as slick.

646
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:51,210
Speaker 1: but Zune is pretty much like the next Step down from iPod in terms of media playing and you can say it looks less slick.

647
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:53,590
Speaker 2: But the comps that are coming out of Redmond right now look fantastic.

648
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:58,890
Speaker 2: The metro UI leaps and bounds above six five and I think that they're catching up quickly.

649
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:01,340
Speaker 2: I believe that they've surpassed Android for sure.

650
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:03,228
Speaker 2: I think that Android is incredibly clunky.

651
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:05,159
Speaker 2: They've gone past Andrew.

652
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:06,309
Speaker 2: I think they're catching up to palm.

653
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:15,941
Speaker 1: Well, and see the thing is I can't say until I use it because I look at those videos and you see like the very Text-based kind of light on dark text and these big like.

654
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:17,806
Speaker 1: I don't know if that actually works.

655
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:19,010
Speaker 0: when I'm it works pretty well.

656
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:24,618
Speaker 0: I mean in like the Windows Media Center app, you know, they got on the HT PC But the Zune HD has that style.

657
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:27,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Zune HD also, you know people seem to like that.

658
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:28,676
Speaker 0: It's not a great screen.

659
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:29,239
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

660
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,030
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played with it for a little bit in a store.

661
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,555
Speaker 2: I was really curious about it And I mean what.

662
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:38,209
Speaker 2: obviously it was for like five minutes But I had a very positive experience with it and bringing that design element to win.

663
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,673
Speaker 0: That's a big thing.

664
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:44,730
Speaker 0: is that the reason I got the iPhone originally despite even being upset with a closed nature at that time?

665
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:46,134
Speaker 0: Right was?

666
00:38:46,435 --> 00:38:48,141
Speaker 0: you know, it was the iPhone 3G.

667
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:48,763
Speaker 0: it came out.

668
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:50,790
Speaker 0: the apps came out at the same time, right?

669
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,230
Speaker 0: It was because I wouldn't need an iPod and a phone at the same time.

670
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,270
Speaker 0: I could just have one thing instead of two things, right?

671
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:56,792
Speaker 0: That is the.

672
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:59,703
Speaker 0: still the number one reason for me to get a smartphone is because I can have.

673
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:04,990
Speaker 0: I won't need a separate iPod If I go to get an Android and I need to go buy an iPod mini from the Apple Store.

674
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:06,315
Speaker 0: What is the point?

675
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:10,330
Speaker 0: I might as well just go get like a freaking candy bar phone for five bucks and my iPod.

676
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:17,690
Speaker 1: But at the same time as much as I want convergence I don't think we're anywhere near having one device that does everything because Apple won't make it happen.

677
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:19,917
Speaker 1: Apple has the power to make this and they won't.

678
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,001
Speaker 2: they're trying.

679
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:23,349
Speaker 2: OS 4 obviously brings in a lot of.

680
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,850
Speaker 1: That's what bothers me because you look at this every time like anyone is close to competing with Apple.

681
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:31,833
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, here's the three features We left out.

682
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:34,369
Speaker 1: there were obvious that we probably already made and now we're giving them to you.

683
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,029
Speaker 2: I'm not just talking about multitasking in this case.

684
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:40,830
Speaker 2: Honestly the game market that they they announced kind of caught me off guard.

685
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,664
Speaker 2: I wasn't prepared for that and it actually Rochelle and I had several discussions about it.

686
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:52,209
Speaker 2: regarding convergence like you were talking about She was you know convinced that the iPhone would never take over a Nintendo space the DS, you know, I love my DS.

687
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:59,896
Speaker 2: I wouldn't ever use my phone to play games But I mean this is the direction that Apple is headed in now and when they throw their weight behind something They can make it happen, you know,

688
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:04,949
Speaker 1: actually that raises a good point because the only other company that is wanted to do that Sort of thing is Microsoft.

689
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:11,071
Speaker 1: They're the all the people who also want commodity hardware and then your games are just apps that you sell All right.

690
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,437
Speaker 0: So in terms of games, right?

691
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,490
Speaker 0: Here's the reason I think that the iPhone really can't replace the DS.

692
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:22,050
Speaker 0: You know like in terms of you know a game on the iPhone something like this flooded game or a little bejeweled, right?

693
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,356
Speaker 0: Totally awesome, right?

694
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:29,121
Speaker 0: I'm on I'm all over that right but it think of like the games I'm playing on my DS my clash of heroes, right?

695
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,410
Speaker 0: Maybe some Phoenix Wright something like that, right?

696
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:43,902
Speaker 0: You're gonna you know pay 30 bucks for this something like that, right if you're buying it You know and then you put it on a phone and you replace your phone every two years You know because your contracts run out Maybe you know you like to sell your phone and get it to.

697
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:49,099
Speaker 0: you know pay for the new one or something You know, especially if it's expensive smart But that's probably exactly what Apple is going for.

698
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:55,985
Speaker 1: they want to lock people in if you buy a hundred games on your iPad iPhone but the thing is because it because I know I'm getting rid of it.

699
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:57,410
Speaker 0: I'm not buying the games.

700
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,077
Speaker 1: Yes, but that's you and you're not.

701
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:00,563
Speaker 2: it's they transfer over.

702
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,410
Speaker 2: This is you you purchase a license.

703
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,758
Speaker 2: You can install those applications on another device.

704
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:05,541
Speaker 2: Absolutely.

705
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:05,902
Speaker 1: You can.

706
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:06,604
Speaker 1: so my pre.

707
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,190
Speaker 2: so if I so I see.

708
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:10,730
Speaker 1: What if I want to leave Apple?

709
00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:12,178
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.

710
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:15,276
Speaker 2: I thought you meant that one device That you're on one device.

711
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:16,620
Speaker 1: They care that you're on Apple.

712
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:20,270
Speaker 0: I mean at least even Nintendo Nintendo's totally closed, right?

713
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,058
Speaker 0: No question about it, but you buy a GBA game.

714
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,666
Speaker 0: You could play that shit on a DS light, right?

715
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:31,301
Speaker 0: You buy you know Not a DSI, but you know, they always keep like two generations.

716
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,067
Speaker 2: Yeah, everything's got an expiration date.

717
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:36,280
Speaker 0: Nothing's perfect You know, but I mean, you know, your DS is not.

718
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,770
Speaker 0: your DS is not like your phone where it's got a contract.

719
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,176
Speaker 0: You're gonna get rid of it and you're getting.

720
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:43,250
Speaker 0: you know, it's like, you know, you're always gonna carry, you know something.

721
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,534
Speaker 0: It's it's I don't know.

722
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:46,983
Speaker 0: It's more like it's a permanent kind of thing.

723
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:47,625
Speaker 2: I don't know.

724
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:51,279
Speaker 2: It's still vendor buy-in You know, you're still buying into a Nintendo product.

725
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:57,890
Speaker 2: You're not gonna be able to bring that DS game over to your Sony PSP Go, no, you're stuck on Nintendo hardware, but your current.

726
00:41:58,331 --> 00:42:04,290
Speaker 0: It's not about being stuck on the hardware with a DS because you're you buy a DS and you just you just have it forever.

727
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:11,822
Speaker 0: But a cell phone is more of a disposable electronic item as opposed to like a DS or a Wii Permanent people don't think of their phones as disposable.

728
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:12,888
Speaker 1: only nerds like us do.

729
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:15,175
Speaker 1: Look at this.

730
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:20,283
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean a palm free puzzle cost you 600 bucks at the store new I you know, it wears a DS will cost you too.

731
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:21,370
Speaker 2: So I don't know.

732
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:22,249
Speaker 2: I think the you know.

733
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:24,920
Speaker 0: We've said when the contract the thing is right.

734
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,135
Speaker 0: when the contract runs out on that palm free plus in two years You're gonna get a new phone.

735
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,847
Speaker 0: and if you don't get another web OS phone goodbye to all your web OS.

736
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:33,750
Speaker 0: two years of investment.

737
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:35,216
Speaker 0: Right sitting with the iPhone.

738
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:40,722
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if I go to the iPhone 4, you know, it's like well Goodbye all my iPhone 3 stuff.

739
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:44,621
Speaker 0: because if I'm gonna carry two devices The second device is gonna be iPod nano.

740
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:46,030
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be two smartphones.

741
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:47,685
Speaker 2: Yeah to say.

742
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:48,494
Speaker 2: but again I mean you could.

743
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,097
Speaker 2: in that case you certainly can install Your old apps on the new phone.

744
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:55,130
Speaker 0: if I get an iPhone, right if I switch to Android it's all gone.

745
00:42:55,291 --> 00:43:00,750
Speaker 0: No, so then if I switch to Android and I feel like I might switch to Apple I'm not gonna start investing that heavily in Android either.

746
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I want to be free to pick the best OS two years from now.

747
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,213
Speaker 0: hmm All right,

748
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:19,483
Speaker 1: it just amazes me that a long time ago I was so like I was a Nintendo fan Just talking about gaming and I remember thinking, you know, what Microsoft or the Xbox said we want You know just PCs and you run just games on anything and it's commodity.

749
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:22,634
Speaker 1: and I thought they like that was the worst possible thing That could happen to game.

750
00:43:22,654 --> 00:43:23,620
Speaker 0: I always thought it was great.

751
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:23,881
Speaker 1: now.

752
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:25,370
Speaker 1: I think it's the only thing that can save gaming.

753
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least gaming the way I like it.

754
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:29,757
Speaker 1: but I don't know.

755
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:33,355
Speaker 1: I don't think cell phone games are just There enough for it to matter.

756
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,122
Speaker 2: yet to be part of the problem is control.

757
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:37,330
Speaker 2: the input scheme on them is particularly difficult.

758
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,410
Speaker 0: Well, if it's a real-time game, that's true, right but like Phoenix, right?

759
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,630
Speaker 0: I just brought up right Phoenix, right would totally rock on a phone with a touch screen.

760
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:46,521
Speaker 0: The problem is the long form of it might not work.

761
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:49,070
Speaker 0: So well, you're gonna pay $30 for Phoenix, right?

762
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,334
Speaker 0: It works really well on your phone.

763
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:51,357
Speaker 0: touch the evidence.

764
00:43:51,638 --> 00:43:52,922
Speaker 0: touch what you're investigating it.

765
00:43:52,962 --> 00:43:55,310
Speaker 0: battery runs out battery runs out.

766
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,550
Speaker 0: Who's and who sits there with their phone for that long?

767
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:05,446
Speaker 0: You know, I mean I could sit there with a DS for a long time But to sit there with my phone for that long, you know and it rings while I'm playing the fucking game.

768
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:09,403
Speaker 0: Oh, no You know fuck that shit It doesn't work.

769
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:13,608
Speaker 1: well that could work if people were willing to like if Apple was gonna put the effort in but they're not gonna.

770
00:44:13,668 --> 00:44:18,690
Speaker 1: I don't think the iPhone or the iPad is going to be anything for gamers like us for a long time.

771
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,409
Speaker 1: It's going to be the you know, the so-called casual ghetto games like Farmville.

772
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:25,121
Speaker 0: Yeah, try to advance wars on the iPhone, right?

773
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:28,124
Speaker 2: I think you get away with advance wars on an iPhone Why not?

774
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:28,510
Speaker 0: I don't know.

775
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:34,528
Speaker 1: For one reason nobody I no one uses the actual touch interface.

776
00:44:34,568 --> 00:44:35,250
Speaker 1: This is terrible.

777
00:44:35,692 --> 00:44:38,385
Speaker 1: You sit there and use the plus and the a and the B.

778
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:40,960
Speaker 2: Okay, that's right I was thinking about the touch interface.

779
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:47,830
Speaker 0: But yeah in that in that particular Well, the thing is the DS does have a resistive touchscreen is a capacitive touchscreen.

780
00:44:47,891 --> 00:44:48,829
Speaker 0: It's far more precise.

781
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,777
Speaker 0: It is screen is much higher resolution.

782
00:44:50,797 --> 00:44:58,589
Speaker 0: so you could zoom in right on your unit move them to the right with a little swipe Zoom out, you know, you could get a lot more creative than they do on the DS.

783
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:03,050
Speaker 1: So yeah, you'd have to make a different mode of game though like advanced wars as is wouldn't really work.

784
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,703
Speaker 1: Well, they'd have to change the game significantly.

785
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:05,408
Speaker 1: I don't know.

786
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,380
Speaker 1: I get more like a turn-based supreme commander kind of deal.

787
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:08,466
Speaker 0: I thought I think it would work.

788
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:08,869
Speaker 0: just fine.

789
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:14,212
Speaker 1: I I could get into the way I play in the way I think and I'm why I think a lot of other advanced wars Players at least.

790
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:19,030
Speaker 1: it's very discreet and when I'm strategizing I think up up left left left up up up left left.

791
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,382
Speaker 1: I'm just thinking that as I'm like doing my motions.

792
00:45:21,703 --> 00:45:22,889
Speaker 2: Maybe it's just cuz you're used to it.

793
00:45:23,352 --> 00:45:24,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I don't see.

794
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:27,090
Speaker 0: I mean like zoom in on the units move up into the right.

795
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,939
Speaker 1: There's no reason never zoom in in advanced wars.

796
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,703
Speaker 1: That's the other problem.

797
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:30,889
Speaker 0: Well giant maps, right?

798
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,557
Speaker 1: I mean but advanced wars doesn't scale.

799
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,702
Speaker 0: Well, no, it doesn't.

800
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:35,610
Speaker 0: but you know, there are those big maps.

801
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,025
Speaker 0: They have to pan around all the time.

802
00:45:37,105 --> 00:45:41,610
Speaker 1: very annoying Yeah, but they're not that big the game just I think the game doesn't scale enough and doesn't do enough interesting stuff.

803
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, good.

804
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:48,090
Speaker 0: The other thing is if you did it on something like an iPhone is much more powerful You know, you would do like a two and a half D kind of situation.

805
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:50,430
Speaker 0: You wouldn't do the pixel, you know 2d art.

806
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:51,434
Speaker 0: So you would.

807
00:45:51,555 --> 00:45:52,579
Speaker 0: you know the zooming in and out.

808
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,226
Speaker 0: you could maintain like it wouldn't you know?

809
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:57,275
Speaker 1: pixelate and get all jaggy But then you run out the battery.

810
00:45:58,038 --> 00:45:58,781
Speaker 0: No, not really.

811
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:01,170
Speaker 0: I mean I got some tower defense games that are sort of like that.

812
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:02,509
Speaker 0: Well, I deleted them cuz they saw me.

813
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:11,890
Speaker 1: My pre lasts like, you know a whole day and then some like a day and a half two days if I just use it Normally, but if I surf the web or use run like apps on it, it doesn't even last through the day.

814
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:19,980
Speaker 0: No, really my iPhone always makes it through the day like, you know, sometimes it gets really low if I'm at a convention But I always make it back to the hotel room and charge it up.

815
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,190
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is why I complain about multitasking.

816
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:23,835
Speaker 2: I'm gonna be flat with you.

817
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:26,087
Speaker 2: This is why this is why I bemoan the decision.

818
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:39,407
Speaker 1: sometimes Thing is I'm willing to trade every Disadvantage to have the multitasking because it it's such a paradigm that whenever I borrow an iPhone And like I'm responding to a text message and I want to check my email.

819
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:41,089
Speaker 0: I'm fucked But the iPhone 4 is gonna have it.

820
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,210
Speaker 1: I know so well.

821
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,910
Speaker 2: Let me get let me get technical and complain about something for a second here and I'm really sorry to go off on this.

822
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,397
Speaker 2: But Apple, I don't know.

823
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:51,070
Speaker 2: Have you guys ever experimented with the Apple SDK the iPhone SDK?

824
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:54,381
Speaker 0: But I mean, I know objective C is really painful.

825
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:55,465
Speaker 2: No objective C is great.

826
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:56,549
Speaker 2: I love objective.

827
00:46:56,649 --> 00:47:07,482
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah it brings the flexibility of programming in a high-level language to the speed of bring like working in a well level because what I look like It's it brings to me like, you know, like, you know sort of you know memories of the horrible syntax of C++.

828
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:08,246
Speaker 0: but crook slightly.

829
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:12,382
Speaker 2: so I The small talk syntax takes some getting used to.

830
00:47:12,402 --> 00:47:16,729
Speaker 2: I'll be the last person to disagree But ultimately I was I was you know, I felt very very natural in it.

831
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:17,955
Speaker 2: The thing that really bothered me.

832
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:27,192
Speaker 2: they released an operating system that didn't support multitasking but didn't support any under-the-hood state serialization and Restoration.

833
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,269
Speaker 2: so essentially they gave you no hooks to save your program state and then restore it.

834
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:36,057
Speaker 2: they just told you that you had to do it and I always thought that that was a really like.

835
00:47:36,077 --> 00:47:37,823
Speaker 0: there's no file system, right?

836
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:38,908
Speaker 2: There is a file system.

837
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:45,230
Speaker 2: you Obviously you can write stuff to the disk and that's the only way that developers were able to write their own state serialization codes.

838
00:47:45,854 --> 00:47:48,349
Speaker 2: But they didn't include it by default and I always thought that was a really.

839
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:54,950
Speaker 2: I Didn't want to say like Apple was snubbing developers, but it was definitely like oh This is like an 80% like you definitely just push this out.

840
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:58,043
Speaker 0: Well, they did add like how many new you know API.

841
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,830
Speaker 0: they always brag about how many API's they've added.

842
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,249
Speaker 0: I think they're counting like the individual functions, right?

843
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're like we added hundreds of new API's like what did you add?

844
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:09,184
Speaker 0: like you're counting each and every function that you added as one API.

845
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:11,930
Speaker 2: I mean what is and I mean the stuff they had is always really useful.

846
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:16,850
Speaker 2: But yeah, they didn't address this most basic problem with a non multitasking phone.

847
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:21,961
Speaker 2: I as a developer I felt a little bit of spite and so I had to go off on that.

848
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:23,205
Speaker 2: but it the story.

849
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,269
Speaker 2: it needed to be heard.

850
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:34,758
Speaker 1: We can pretty much end wrap this up I think unless we have some final thoughts on though Like where the where are we going?

851
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:35,361
Speaker 1: Let's jump in right?

852
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:37,450
Speaker 2: I palm up for sale.

853
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:56,516
Speaker 2: HTC needs to grab them shore up their patent defense against Google or excuse me They didn't show up the patent defense against Apple And then they need to bring those engineers on and really kind of turn them loose on The the Android UI itself and Google really needs to take some cues from HTC because HTC picks up the slack Everywhere that Google

854
00:48:56,536 --> 00:48:56,797
Speaker 0: fails.

855
00:48:56,817 --> 00:48:59,970
Speaker 0: Well, I think Google really needs to just pick up the UI across the board.

856
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:00,552
Speaker 0: They've just been.

857
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:03,003
Speaker 0: you know, I mean, you know Gmail still got the good UI.

858
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:04,610
Speaker 0: Google search still really good.

859
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:16,154
Speaker 0: But like all their new stuff you look at like Google buzz Google wave Android right there like making these like it looks like might as well just get no more Katie up in right to do that Kind of shit.

860
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:18,010
Speaker 1: Never mind the fact that they have so much money.

861
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,441
Speaker 0: There is no excuse to be you know, they should be able to.

862
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:22,470
Speaker 0: why can no one make a good user interface?

863
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,477
Speaker 0: But Apple right we're suffering.

864
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:25,421
Speaker 0: we have to choose.

865
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:29,650
Speaker 1: you know who can make it people who made a web OS But those are Apple guys, right?

866
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,014
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

867
00:49:31,314 --> 00:49:33,400
Speaker 0: why are the nerds are upset?

868
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:41,810
Speaker 0: because we're forced to choose between good UI and a phone that actually Features that we want, you know, and it's not you know, not just in phones, but in everything.

869
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:43,681
Speaker 0: Why are we forced to make this choice?

870
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:45,250
Speaker 0: Why can't we have both Chris?

871
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,266
Speaker 1: Part of it might be look at the.

872
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:50,710
Speaker 1: you know The slicker phones the ones with better you eyes are also more closed more controlled.

873
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:52,209
Speaker 0: But why does it have to be that way?

874
00:49:52,750 --> 00:50:01,150
Speaker 2: I actually read an article on slate the other day that ended in the sentence that the idea of a perfect computer and an open Computer are mutually exclusive concepts that they can never coexist.

875
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:03,194
Speaker 0: Okay So here's here's what I have to say.

876
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:07,186
Speaker 0: example number one the greatest computer that has ever existed the Apple to GS.

877
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,813
Speaker 0: right the jobs was Combination.

878
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:10,134
Speaker 0: right.

879
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:11,879
Speaker 0: you look at this thing you turn it on.

880
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:13,103
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

881
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:13,785
Speaker 0: It just turns on.

882
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:20,210
Speaker 0: do nice noise You know amazing sound for the time the graphics just blew your mind and it just works.

883
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,393
Speaker 0: It just works.

884
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:26,267
Speaker 0: and thing is you open it up and the inside is just as much a thing of beauty.

885
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:30,039
Speaker 0: eight slots Lined up all identical everything clearly labeled.

886
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:33,710
Speaker 0: flat laid-out board power supply doesn't cover up anything that you need to access.

887
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,754
Speaker 0: It's a straight line.

888
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:37,202
Speaker 0: It is like the miracle of computing right?

889
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:39,550
Speaker 0: so why can't we have a phone?

890
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,756
Speaker 0: That's like the Apple to GS.

891
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:43,030
Speaker 0: the inside is as beautiful as the outside.

892
00:50:43,396 --> 00:50:49,164
Speaker 0: You know it's open But you know all the decisions about design are still being made by one person.

893
00:50:49,204 --> 00:50:54,155
Speaker 0: if some schmuck wants to submit a patch that is freaking ugly as UI stuff Fucking rejected.

894
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:54,376
Speaker 0: right.

895
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:55,561
Speaker 0: that's how the Linux kernel works.

896
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,997
Speaker 0: or if Linus doesn't like that shit It doesn't get in.

897
00:50:58,118 --> 00:50:58,990
Speaker 1: you know you can meet midway.

898
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,230
Speaker 1: What if we just had the closed you know iPhone style phone by default?

899
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,167
Speaker 1: But with the option of sideloading for people who are willing to risk screwing everything up.

900
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:08,373
Speaker 2: yeah Yeah, I was.

901
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:16,410
Speaker 2: actually I was gonna bring up the idea of once you give people that control you suddenly You know you lose a lot of the control over the user user interface and you expose yourself to a lot of problems.

902
00:51:16,571 --> 00:51:17,435
Speaker 2: But but why?

903
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:21,294
Speaker 0: I mean 90% of people aren't gonna ever sideload anything And they're all gonna.

904
00:51:21,314 --> 00:51:22,940
Speaker 0: you know you could have this iPhone 3G.

905
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,450
Speaker 0: just it is right now right and have nerd mode.

906
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:31,649
Speaker 0: So I'm a nerd and I fuck it up right and then I just reset it reflash the firmware And I'm back to beginning if I ever fuck it up too much.

907
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:33,519
Speaker 0: but my mom had the same exact phone.

908
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:36,717
Speaker 0: she would never sideload a thing in her life and You know she would.

909
00:51:36,818 --> 00:51:44,770
Speaker 0: you should have the exact same perfect Steve Jobs Experience that it is right now where it's perfectly closed and all Apple has to do is just be like yeah, okay?

910
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:46,229
Speaker 0: Here's you know one check box.

911
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,772
Speaker 0: It's open.

912
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,830
Speaker 2: now all Apple needs to do is support two entirely different modes of operation.

913
00:51:51,257 --> 00:51:52,090
Speaker 0: It's not too entirely.

914
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:55,660
Speaker 2: Now you can't install paid apps because you're sideloading.

915
00:51:55,881 --> 00:51:56,824
Speaker 2: where are they gonna go?

916
00:51:56,884 --> 00:52:05,713
Speaker 2: the reason that half the reason that that phone is so Closed down you can't use target disk mode anymore half the reason is because these paid apps that you can't like they don't want you Just copying them off of there.

917
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:09,124
Speaker 2: so by sideloading suddenly you lose all your paid apps.

918
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,674
Speaker 2: you introduce this weird I mean.

919
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:17,289
Speaker 2: obviously it doesn't sound like much like oh put another memory card in there But it does induce a lot of variables especially once it's like.

920
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:18,980
Speaker 2: well You don't know if the memory card is gonna be inserted.

921
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,489
Speaker 2: Android has a lot of problems with this.

922
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:23,770
Speaker 2: You know you mount the memory card you copy your files over you unmount it.

923
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,423
Speaker 2: It's got to itemize everything on the disk it.

924
00:52:26,483 --> 00:52:27,890
Speaker 2: You know it takes a long time to index.

925
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:29,920
Speaker 1: Is this not just a matter of maturity?

926
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,010
Speaker 1: I mean PCs were that way a long time ago.

927
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,565
Speaker 1: I mean your PC.

928
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,694
Speaker 1: You don't know if the.

929
00:52:33,915 --> 00:52:37,268
Speaker 1: you know your USB or 512 K stick is in or not and you unplug it.

930
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:40,699
Speaker 1: you fuck the whole Thing up and you run some app and it crops the boot sector.

931
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:45,895
Speaker 1: and PCs now are you know like Windows is a very controlled Experience by default now.

932
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:50,010
Speaker 1: Let's ignore the the security holes for a second because that's more and more.

933
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,790
Speaker 1: It seems like it's third-party things like Adobe that are causing a lot of that.

934
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if they're worried about I want to get into that.

935
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:55,736
Speaker 0: They're worried about piracy.

936
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,110
Speaker 0: someone copying their paid apps off of there, right?

937
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,828
Speaker 0: It's like come on people are already jailbreaking and pirating the paid apps.

938
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:05,969
Speaker 0: The people who are you know the only people who are smart enough to copy the paid apps off and pirate them on.

939
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:09,062
Speaker 0: you know An iPhone that has this mode where you could sideload.

940
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:11,050
Speaker 0: are the people who are smart enough to jailbreak now?

941
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,816
Speaker 0: So if they're doing it, they're already doing it.

942
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,198
Speaker 0: You're not.

943
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:16,490
Speaker 0: the piracy is not going to increase it absolutely would know.

944
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,996
Speaker 2: Jailbreak penetration right now is only at about 10% of devices Which is almost nothing.

945
00:53:21,036 --> 00:53:25,920
Speaker 2: whereas if you offered side loading and an easy way to do this I can assure I can literally assure you that it would right.

946
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,747
Speaker 0: but are those people who would side load?

947
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:28,550
Speaker 0: would they you know?

948
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,990
Speaker 0: Are they buying apps now and they wouldn't buy them if they could pirate them?

949
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:36,005
Speaker 2: I I had tested at least some of them to say that there are no lost potential sales here.

950
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:37,050
Speaker 2: It's it's short-sighted.

951
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:39,901
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a large enough number.

952
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,370
Speaker 1: I would say I would argue that just that isn't it not inevitable.

953
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,057
Speaker 1: I mean, this is what happened with PCs.

954
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:47,370
Speaker 0: Okay, DRM doesn't right plus alright, so, okay.

955
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:54,302
Speaker 0: So let's let's go on to the assumption that most people right like, you know The moms and whatever would just continue as normal paid apps, whatever right.

956
00:53:54,783 --> 00:54:00,970
Speaker 0: there would be some nerds and some punk kids Right who are maybe buying some apps now who wouldn't buy them and would sideload and pirate, right?

957
00:54:01,773 --> 00:54:08,019
Speaker 0: But now take into that calculation all the nerds who would abandon Android palm this the mark.

958
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,849
Speaker 0: everything else in the market would die.

959
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:13,330
Speaker 0: Apple would have a monopoly on everything because there would be no complaints anymore.

960
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,844
Speaker 0: No one would say all iPhone sucks at closed.

961
00:54:16,105 --> 00:54:21,127
Speaker 0: everyone would be on iPhone 100% across the board except the businessman who has to keep a blackberry.

962
00:54:21,147 --> 00:54:33,000
Speaker 0: and That increased sales of iPhones right would make up for all those lost sales of the piracy whatever Right, I mean if the iPhone was open who would not buy it?

963
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,524
Speaker 0: who would buy something else?

964
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:35,226
Speaker 0: who?

965
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:41,250
Speaker 0: anybody anyone You know, is there anyone out there who would still choose Android if you could sideload on the iPhone?

966
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,017
Speaker 1: Well, this is partly why I'd be a question.

967
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:49,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're talking about the UI and I'm still like until I use them If he on the Microsoft phones the seven phones.

968
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:57,070
Speaker 1: But I feel like that is where the middle ground is gonna be in the end because I think that that is going to have Much more capability for loading your own apps and having your own control.

969
00:54:57,474 --> 00:54:59,010
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be the same paradigm as Windows.

970
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:04,750
Speaker 1: You can cock it up to a certain degree But at the same time it gets you 80% of the way to having a nice experience.

971
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,933
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, no one's asking for Linux openness, you know What?

972
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:09,194
Speaker 2: n 900?

973
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:14,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're asking for Windows openness on that, you know OS X openness on the iPhone.

974
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,714
Speaker 0: We're not asking for.

975
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:17,984
Speaker 0: you know, give us the whole source code to the whole show.

976
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:19,550
Speaker 1: That was what bothered me not the phone.

977
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,516
Speaker 1: I don't want to get on a tangent here.

978
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:24,777
Speaker 1: But the fact that the iPad was a 100% as closed as the iPhone.

979
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:28,248
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I expected it to be a little more open and the fact that it wasn't.

980
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:33,061
Speaker 1: now Miss under s miss estimating what Apple was trying to.

981
00:55:33,102 --> 00:55:35,150
Speaker 0: people aren't joking when they say it's a big iPod touch.

982
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:36,434
Speaker 0: It's a big iPod touch.

983
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:41,050
Speaker 1: That's it, but there's so much potential board games shared space games.

984
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,086
Speaker 0: That is something that could make them for the App Store.

985
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:44,910
Speaker 0: get them approved.

986
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:54,249
Speaker 1: It wouldn't compete with the DS Just fine but people like us would all have iPads and we'd all play like Puerto Rico on them You know.

987
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:59,190
Speaker 2: Actually, if we could bring this topic around for a second you mentioned that it's just a big iPod touch.

988
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:01,329
Speaker 2: My question to you guys is is that bad?

989
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:07,930
Speaker 1: It's bad for someone like me because the stuff that I want is probably never going to exist on that device.

990
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:16,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean basically all I want in a tablet right is I want you know The good user interface and the really accurate, you know capacitive touchscreen.

991
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:18,162
Speaker 0: But what would I do with a tablet?

992
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:19,290
Speaker 0: There are two things I would do with it.

993
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,585
Speaker 0: Number one is I would read the web in bed, which the iPod the iPad perfect.

994
00:56:23,887 --> 00:56:24,790
Speaker 0: Nothing better, right?

995
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,168
Speaker 0: Well, what else would I do with it?

996
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:31,369
Speaker 0: I would want to program all sorts of crazy shit like board games, you know to work when all my friends had them.

997
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,314
Speaker 0: Absolutely can't do it.

998
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:35,566
Speaker 0: So it's it's had you know, and it's so much money.

999
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:36,430
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

1000
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,530
Speaker 0: It was a hundred bucks to read the web in bed sold, right?

1001
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,590
Speaker 1: You know, that's the thing because I you know There's all the rumors about the Google tablet coming and Sam's everyone's making tablets.

1002
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,268
Speaker 1: Now the iPad is gonna have some stiff competition and those things are gonna just run windows.

1003
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:51,548
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't think they're gonna have any competition because they just run windows.

1004
00:56:51,628 --> 00:57:06,648
Speaker 1: windows For people like me because for a $200 like if it was just good enough Like it was halfway to the goodness of the hardware of the iPad But there was but like reading the web in bed with like Firefox on a Windows tablet.

1005
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:08,740
Speaker 0: Forget it I might as well use my laptop.

1006
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:13,030
Speaker 2: Yeah, and once you pull windows on there You're talking about an Intel chipset an Intel hardware stack.

1007
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,663
Speaker 2: You're talking about five six hours of battery life tops.

1008
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,110
Speaker 2: You're not talking about what if it runs?

1009
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:21,749
Speaker 1: What if we run some sort of Windows 7 like halfway even further between Windows 7 and Windows?

1010
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,770
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would love it if they would put Windows Phone 7 onto a tablet.

1011
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:27,449
Speaker 2: I I mean I would be in line for that absolutely.

1012
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:32,974
Speaker 0: but what I'm saying can make it talk to the Xbox just like they've made the Zune and all the Windows computers talk to the Xbox.

1013
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:36,609
Speaker 2: that's absolutely slated for Windows Mobile 7 And I'm really excited about it.

1014
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:42,790
Speaker 2: But what I'm saying is our problem here is that we're attempting to take these desktop operating systems and use them on tablets.

1015
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,047
Speaker 2: And when everybody says it's just a big iPod touch.

1016
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:51,210
Speaker 2: I'm like, yeah That's what makes it great because the desktop operating system is not suited to a device of yeah of that build.

1017
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:54,926
Speaker 0: And so, you know, I it is a great UI, but it just doesn't.

1018
00:57:55,147 --> 00:57:55,508
Speaker 0: it doesn't.

1019
00:57:57,071 --> 00:58:04,377
Speaker 1: It's like, you know the BoS that died a long time ago where you know user interface like user input mattered more than most other Things in the OS.

1020
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:10,944
Speaker 1: we need a new Paradigm of UI which is basically just Apple quality, but Windows openness.

1021
00:58:10,964 --> 00:58:12,950
Speaker 1: free as in beer not free as in speech.

1022
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:14,335
Speaker 1: I'd be fine with beer.

1023
00:58:14,355 --> 00:58:17,849
Speaker 1: I don't even I don't care about the new stuff anymore at all at this point in my life.

1024
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:18,912
Speaker 2: It's me.

1025
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:25,410
Speaker 2: Yeah, I hate to say but when you look at what it's up against nowadays, it's it's literally difficult to and I'm positive.

1026
00:58:25,471 --> 00:58:27,690
Speaker 2: I'll raise the ire of many with that statement.

1027
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:33,129
Speaker 2: But Linux has failed time and time again to catch up in the desktop space where the other contenders are.

1028
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:35,558
Speaker 1: I'm an IT professional using Linux forever.

1029
00:58:35,618 --> 00:58:42,906
Speaker 1: I use Linux and like all the important stuff in my life except this show Except gaming except 90% of what I do with a computer outside of work.

1030
00:58:43,006 --> 00:58:43,950
Speaker 1: I need Windows for that.

1031
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:46,370
Speaker 1: I run Linux in a VM for the one thing.

1032
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:51,550
Speaker 0: I mean, I have Linux on my laptop, but I got a Windows desktop a Windows home theater computer, right?

1033
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:57,030
Speaker 0: You know and I have Linux in a virtual machine when I need to do development stuff because that's what it rocks at.

1034
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:58,970
Speaker 0: You know, I have OS X at work at work.

1035
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:07,490
Speaker 0: I would like to have Linux because I'm developing at work, but I didn't get to choose, you know and Yeah, I mean, it's just Windows everywhere for servers and development.

1036
00:59:07,651 --> 00:59:14,986
Speaker 1: I use Windows for everything else because it's it's open enough to do what I need to do But it starts I guess more usable and better.

1037
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:19,725
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean I use OS X because I almost couldn't give up the Unix shell.

1038
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:21,150
Speaker 2: I don't know what happened.

1039
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,214
Speaker 2: I became addicted at some point.

1040
00:59:22,455 --> 00:59:22,797
Speaker 0: Definitely.

1041
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:30,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely, you know, I mean for if it was work with Windows I would be screwed and where I just be doing all my work and putty as a station to some other machine.

1042
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:31,817
Speaker 0: I'm doing that.

1043
00:59:31,837 --> 00:59:33,550
Speaker 0: I might as well just have the other machine on my desk.

1044
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:33,634
Speaker 0: But

1045
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:43,810
Speaker 2: no, you know I use OS X on the desktop and exactly like you guys I keep the the Linux virtual machine around for when I need to Really mess around with Android or when I really need to, you know test something on a web server something like that.

1046
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:48,548
Speaker 2: You know, I couldn't imagine using it on the desktop and I feel like that's a pretty common statement.

1047
00:59:48,568 --> 00:59:54,229
Speaker 0: Mmm It's unfortunate, but why don't they just freaking get someone to like, you know, there have to be you know.

1048
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,850
Speaker 0: Is it just that there are only like five people in the world who know how to make a good UI or like?

1049
00:59:59,551 --> 00:59:59,892
Speaker 0: What is that?

1050
00:59:59,913 --> 01:00:04,432
Speaker 2: maybe there's only five people in the world who can get enough people moving in the same direction to create a good UI.

1051
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:11,370
Speaker 1: I mean one thing that might have worked well for Apple is the very monolithic, you know You've got the figure at the top saying do it like this and fuck anyone who thinks otherwise.

1052
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:17,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, you know Linux has that a lot of projects have a leader who says Listen to what he says and go.

1053
01:00:17,537 --> 01:00:20,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna fork it and then they make a half-ass fork.

1054
01:00:20,714 --> 01:00:24,761
Speaker 0: They make a half-ass work that fails But as long as the core project lives on let them fork and leave.

1055
01:00:24,781 --> 01:00:27,150
Speaker 2: it was actually the start of your sentence that damned it.

1056
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,578
Speaker 2: There are a lot of projects dot dot dot it's.

1057
01:00:29,678 --> 01:00:31,605
Speaker 2: it's too distributed when you've got it.

1058
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:33,090
Speaker 2: rhythm box is a perfect example.

1059
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:45,658
Speaker 2: Rhythm box doesn't necessarily behave like you're at you know, like pigeon doesn't necessarily behave like Nautilus, you know You can attempt to wrangle all these developers into shape, but there will always be these slight differences

1060
01:00:45,983 --> 01:00:52,930
Speaker 1: and think about evaporate out like developers will kind of just just Appear and get mad and fork off and maybe they'll work on another project.

1061
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,215
Speaker 1: But you've lost them.

1062
01:00:54,315 --> 01:01:03,530
Speaker 1: and if the guys who did the UI like if there are three good guys doing UI and one of them Quits your project because he disagrees about whether or not they should be green or blue You've lost a third of your UI development.

1063
01:01:04,072 --> 01:01:10,152
Speaker 0: See, I think that what we need is we need some sort of open source project where it's like you come into it But it's you know You it's.

1064
01:01:10,674 --> 01:01:11,999
Speaker 0: the source is open as in.

1065
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:18,290
Speaker 0: everyone gets to see the code everyone sharing it Anyone can come and work on it, but the specs are dictated.

1066
01:01:18,497 --> 01:01:23,910
Speaker 0: but you know There is someone who is making the decisions and you either code what they wanted you to code or we don't accept your patch.

1067
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,223
Speaker 1: Are you gonna work on a project like that?

1068
01:01:25,244 --> 01:01:25,810
Speaker 1: Would that be fun?

1069
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:30,004
Speaker 1: If it was really freaking on it wasn't exactly a hundred percent the way you wanted it to be.

1070
01:01:30,024 --> 01:01:31,450
Speaker 0: the thing is, right?

1071
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:36,634
Speaker 0: I mean if it's good if they've got like the demo up that convinces me like that The UI is really good.

1072
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:43,057
Speaker 0: Then I'm like if you you know, if someone put up an iPhone demo, right and was like Hey, we need people to work on this.

1073
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:53,750
Speaker 0: Here's the specs to make this awesome UI and you were like, holy shit But don't you need a jobs or a Wozniak some like visionary to be like look yeah the guy who made the demo.

1074
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:54,814
Speaker 1: So, where are these people?

1075
01:01:55,055 --> 01:01:55,597
Speaker 2: I don't know.

1076
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:58,830
Speaker 2: they don't exist making money at Apple and palm exactly, right?

1077
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:04,930
Speaker 2: No, ultimately, you know, I Scott and I were discussing this on his blog at one point.

1078
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,027
Speaker 2: I think he's absolutely right, you know, like Plato said you need.

1079
01:02:08,068 --> 01:02:08,490
Speaker 2: what did he say?

1080
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:15,010
Speaker 2: It was philosopher Kings in charge of the nation, but we need a philosopher King developer to stand and you know shine a beacon

1081
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:28,464
Speaker 1: Diocletian situation because if centralized governance of any project means that a smart philosopher King can make leaps and bounds They can make revolutions overnight and one asshole can ruin the whole thing.

1082
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:29,508
Speaker 0: How can you ruin the whole thing?

1083
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:29,990
Speaker 0: What's he gonna do?

1084
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,710
Speaker 2: Steve Jobs could make sure that you can't program in unity or flash on the.

1085
01:02:37,392 --> 01:02:38,841
Speaker 0: So here's here's another right.

1086
01:02:39,082 --> 01:02:45,830
Speaker 0: maybe instead of you know There's non-existent good UI creator who's gonna help us all out and design something for us to code up, right?

1087
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:48,918
Speaker 0: Why don't we just fucking copy the iPhone pixel per pixel?

1088
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:49,660
Speaker 0: Fuck them.

1089
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:53,550
Speaker 0: Just copy the shit right make an open-source identical clone.

1090
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,357
Speaker 1: What's the patent encumbers though?

1091
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:58,290
Speaker 0: Because they're what we reverse engineered it in a clean room.

1092
01:02:58,510 --> 01:02:59,554
Speaker 0: No, right, right.

1093
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:03,867
Speaker 1: a sheer number of patents that all these companies have is I think the biggest.

1094
01:03:03,907 --> 01:03:04,790
Speaker 0: I just given the finger.

1095
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:11,276
Speaker 0: It's the same way you get like, you know, the the DVD breaking codes from some server in Europe or the you know The video codec from some server.

1096
01:03:11,296 --> 01:03:18,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone has someone has to do it and say I'm going to be the DVD on I'm going to take all the shit that is gonna fly my way.

1097
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:23,879
Speaker 2: So so we were just talking about the fact that if you fork a project and it's not quite as good Nobody's gonna use it.

1098
01:03:23,919 --> 01:03:25,009
Speaker 2: Everybody's gonna use the good one.

1099
01:03:25,331 --> 01:03:26,797
Speaker 2: How long do you think it would take?

1100
01:03:26,898 --> 01:03:29,730
Speaker 2: how much effort do you think it would take to re-implement that UI from the bottom?

1101
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:29,911
Speaker 2: Up?

1102
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:36,375
Speaker 2: and even if you did do you ever think that you could get it as good as what Apple has done given how tightly Coupled they are to their hardware?

1103
01:03:36,475 --> 01:03:39,908
Speaker 1: and look how fast Apple moves the moment the final when you finally get to.

1104
01:03:39,928 --> 01:03:42,222
Speaker 1: I have done You know the iPhone for perfectly.

1105
01:03:42,243 --> 01:03:46,926
Speaker 2: they've got iPhone 8 Yeah, and mono fights this battle every day and that's why they're still at dotnet.

1106
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:47,690
Speaker 2: what to five?

1107
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:49,621
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe they have three now, but I'm not sure.

1108
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:51,290
Speaker 0: I think that's the what the thing is.

1109
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,012
Speaker 0: I think the real problem you just pointed out is at least you know in terms of phones Right?

1110
01:03:55,073 --> 01:04:00,538
Speaker 0: is the hardware is gonna get you every time, you know, I mean, oh god We could talk an hour about the hardware you're gonna get.

1111
01:04:00,658 --> 01:04:01,260
Speaker 0: you need to get.

1112
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,610
Speaker 0: you need to get touch screens that are this quality.

1113
01:04:03,871 --> 01:04:07,226
Speaker 0: You need to get someone to assemble them as carefully right.

1114
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:09,436
Speaker 0: you need to get you know The whole package.

1115
01:04:09,457 --> 01:04:11,910
Speaker 0: you need to get someone to shrink it down to the right size.

1116
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:13,939
Speaker 0: You got to get the right megapixel camera.

1117
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:16,190
Speaker 0: You got to get it all, you know, how are you gonna do that?

1118
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:16,954
Speaker 0: You know, you can't.

1119
01:04:16,995 --> 01:04:17,762
Speaker 0: it's not open source.

1120
01:04:17,782 --> 01:04:18,590
Speaker 0: You need some fucking money.

1121
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:25,131
Speaker 2: Well, I mean if HTC could you know sell a blank phone for four or five hundred dollars and you could sideload your own OS Into it.

1122
01:04:25,352 --> 01:04:32,031
Speaker 0: I think they could be suckered into doing yeah, but you still won't have the the phone that is designed for the OS Tandem.

1123
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:32,674
Speaker 0: No exactly.

1124
01:04:32,694 --> 01:04:34,340
Speaker 2: This is that's part of androids big problem.

1125
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:34,721
Speaker 2: We were going.

1126
01:04:34,782 --> 01:04:36,408
Speaker 2: we talked about the Java VM earlier.

1127
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:40,705
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you know look at all the different Android phones, right?

1128
01:04:40,765 --> 01:04:42,618
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's like well How's my app gonna run?

1129
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:43,465
Speaker 0: and it's gonna run different.

1130
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:44,320
Speaker 0: on the droid I got.

1131
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:50,278
Speaker 0: you know I made an action game and just got keyboard controls if you don't have a keyboard while it's gonna be not as good I can only imagine.

1132
01:04:50,298 --> 01:04:51,390
Speaker 2: it makes developing native code.

1133
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,037
Speaker 2: They have the NDK the native development could.

1134
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,266
Speaker 2: I can only imagine it makes developing native code very difficult.

1135
01:04:55,286 --> 01:05:00,177
Speaker 2: now that they're talking about shipping atom powered Android devices now, how's that gonna work?

1136
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:01,844
Speaker 0: I'm what I'll be in the tablets.

1137
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,250
Speaker 0: They're not gonna ship phones with Adam.

1138
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:08,743
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was wondering how they're gonna deal with this NDK tie-in.

1139
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:09,886
Speaker 2: are they gonna emulate?

1140
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,696
Speaker 0: you're getting your codes gonna look like All the new code.

1141
01:05:13,158 --> 01:05:14,404
Speaker 0: if deaf BSD.

1142
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:20,027
Speaker 1: if deaf, you know Yeah, if they have this right that that's the road to just disaster in the long run.

1143
01:05:20,228 --> 01:05:22,503
Speaker 2: No, definitely I wouldn't really like.

1144
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:27,790
Speaker 1: in terms of the Linux world We have not come yet to the like final disaster of the fact that everything is so fractured.

1145
01:05:28,152 --> 01:05:28,657
Speaker 2: I don't know.

1146
01:05:28,697 --> 01:05:30,250
Speaker 2: Have you looked at a config script recently?

1147
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,440
Speaker 2: We might be looking at the end still works.

1148
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,749
Speaker 0: that's the problem because it's a miracle of all.

1149
01:05:35,809 --> 01:05:36,331
Speaker 0: you know The.

1150
01:05:36,572 --> 01:05:41,330
Speaker 0: that's why I keep talking about use Linux for development because the development toolset on Linux.

1151
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:45,189
Speaker 0: It's just so unbelievable in that it makes all this shit actually work, you know.

1152
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:48,704
Speaker 2: Unbelievable and byproduct of tenacity or two very different things.

1153
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:50,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean we're fucking.

1154
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:54,594
Speaker 0: I mean I don't know how to use autocomph, but it's what it's a Automaker the worst.

1155
01:05:54,996 --> 01:06:01,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I download it and someone else used autocomph And I just yeah, I just typed dot slash configure and it's a miracle, you know.

1156
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,630
Speaker 2: And certainly a miracle it is again.

1157
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:10,280
Speaker 0: I used it once and I don't ever intend to go in the internet is just a miracle bunch of people packets hitchhiking from Here to there, right?

1158
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:15,027
Speaker 1: All right, I think we should wrap this up and I think we'll have to have future conversations.

1159
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:17,133
Speaker 1: I mean Hardware alone.

1160
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:21,070
Speaker 1: I have an hour about the fact that I love this keyboard and no one else does a keyboard as good as this.

1161
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,078
Speaker 2: Yeah, I hate those for physical keyboards.

1162
01:06:23,138 --> 01:06:25,810
Speaker 2: I could go on for an hour about why I think they're not well suited for these devices.

1163
01:06:25,992 --> 01:06:29,237
Speaker 1: So I think it'd be a good show Alright, so thank you gentlemen.

Speaker 2: I've got the one big actually.

1179
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:55,259
Speaker 1: There's two articles I submit to varak dot.

1180
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:56,166
Speaker 1: org slash blog.

1181
01:06:56,206 --> 01:06:59,095
Speaker 2: You're fine I. There's two articles up right now.

1182
01:06:59,235 --> 01:07:03,370
Speaker 2: one about why we shouldn't necessarily be fearing the iPad and why we should be looking forward to why?

1183
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,092
Speaker 2: Android is good.

1184
01:07:04,393 --> 01:07:07,844
Speaker 2: And then the article that comes directly after it which is here's why Android is awful.

1185
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,775
Speaker 2: I Intend to update it more.

1186
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:12,883
Speaker 2: I'm gonna get the HTC incredible when it comes out.

1187
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:13,687
Speaker 2: I'm gonna revisit the.

1188
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:17,080
Speaker 2: I you know The Android interface I really has your your contract is over.

1189
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,087
Speaker 2: Well, I I'm just gonna buy one.

1190
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:19,770
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm so sick.

1191
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:23,370
Speaker 2: I'm literally so irritated with this awful device that I'm gonna buy a new phone.

1192
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:24,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I would have.

1193
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:35,067
Speaker 2: I would have probably gone to like the Verizon Nexus one, you know, something like that You know the contract wasn't being credible is sort of a repackaged Nexus one If you will, the Nexus one actually has like a kind of a bad touchscreen.

1194
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:36,412
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah Yeah It.

1195
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:47,438
Speaker 2: it performs really poorly with what's called near axis input Which is when your fingers get close together Like you put your fingers close together spread them apart and register your fingers in the opposite corners So that that's fixed on the incredible.

1196
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:52,990
Speaker 2: the incredible uses HTC's proprietary sense UI Which I find to be much more tasteful than the built-in androids.

1197
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,180
Speaker 2: I don't know if y'all ever looked at a stock Android UI.

1198
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,004
Speaker 0: It's really bad.

1199
01:07:56,144 --> 01:07:57,430
Speaker 2: I think it's ugly as sin.

1200
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,456
Speaker 2: I don't know where they dug.

1201
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:04,610
Speaker 1: these people ever used some of the more raw X window or like the Athena widgets?

1202
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,414
Speaker 2: It's not quite that bad.

1203
01:08:07,595 --> 01:08:09,260
Speaker 2: But I mean we're talking like AWT.

1204
01:08:09,702 --> 01:08:11,327
Speaker 2: No, it's it's not like it's not gross.

1205
01:08:11,347 --> 01:08:12,430
Speaker 2: They're just poorly designed.

1206
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,298
Speaker 2: Well, we're actually what we're talking about is KDE.

1207
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:15,302
Speaker 2: We're talking about plasma.

1208
01:08:15,864 --> 01:08:18,524
Speaker 2: They wanted so hard to look cool But it just looks like stupid.

1209
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:22,149
Speaker 2: Yeah That's that's kind of where I'm coming from with that.

1210
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,810
Speaker 2: So I'm gonna revisit the article and you know, I want to get a palm pre.

1211
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,210
Speaker 2: I want to really play around with that.

1212
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:35,010
Speaker 2: So yeah, I mean if you want to if you want to come hit up my blog I'm gonna be doing a lot more with it And obviously I'm working at Muse games now, so we're gonna be doing some cool stuff in the future.

1213
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,274
Speaker 2: So be sure to check that out, too.

1214
01:08:36,877 --> 01:08:40,028

01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:09,562
