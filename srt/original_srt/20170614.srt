1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,117
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday June 14th 2017.

2
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:14,586
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm scared, and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:17,230
Speaker 0: It's an anime news random.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,716
Speaker 0: Let's do this The longest time.

5
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:27,622
Speaker 0: whenever we like don't have a Monday episode We always think why don't we do a tech news roundup?

6
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:32,785
Speaker 1: we do it once a year and for some reason It's once a year around the same time every year like right around that time.

7
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:33,810
Speaker 0: We run out of tech news.

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,412
Speaker 0: We're like well.

9
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:35,256
Speaker 0: We can't do one again.

10
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:35,979
Speaker 0: We just did one.

11
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:43,447
Speaker 0: then we look and it's almost exactly a year previous Mm-hmm, but we never really do that with all the other days, and I feel like that could save us.

12
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:50,750
Speaker 1: well cuz there aren't Enough news is in any of the other categories true to make a roundup, right?

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,814
Speaker 1: And also we weren't.

14
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:55,564
Speaker 1: we were gonna do just a regular old episode reviewing something.

15
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:56,548
Speaker 1: you just didn't watch it.

16
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:57,110
Speaker 1: I've been busy.

17
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:06,769
Speaker 0: I'll watch it for the next Wednesday show and I'll read that manga that you saw me by Literally before he started streaming, and I'll be going to London, so there's no excuse to not read it.

18
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:17,394
Speaker 0: In fact there's no excuse not to watch the thing either because I have the Now that you can offline watch a lot of the anime on Netflix is in the offline things like gonna watch it like on my Flight mm-hmm.

19
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:22,578
Speaker 0: so I can watch the thing and read the manga which I've seen everywhere And I just never read for some reason.

20
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:26,266
Speaker 0: cuz actually when I looked at that cover again It actually looked like the kind of thing I would like.

21
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:44,875
Speaker 0: so uh Yeah, guess we'll just get right into our anime manga comic and related media news, but first Things of the day, so what do you got?

22
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:45,760
Speaker 1: so this Austria?

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,084
Speaker 1: I think it's an Australian guy.

24
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:51,020
Speaker 0: this guy sounds so Australian 90% sure it's Australian guy.

25
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:56,707
Speaker 1: He goes to the beach and one of the things you do at the beach besides swimming is Digging a hole in the sand.

26
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:57,975
Speaker 1: because what else you got to do with Sam?

27
00:01:57,995 --> 00:02:00,510
Speaker 1: besides dig a hole I'll build a castle out of fun fact.

28
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:13,100
Speaker 0: when I was a kid like young kid we'd go to the beach up in Northern Michigan every year and One day us and all the other like kids like relative kids and neighbor kids We just started digging a hole and we dug a real deep hole.

29
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:16,550
Speaker 0: And then we got the idea to cover it in sticks.

30
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:23,392
Speaker 0: cover those sticks and leaves cover that those leaves and sand Mm-hmm, and then we left it there and we're giggling about it all day.

31
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:25,660
Speaker 0: and finally our parents like what are you guys all giggling about?

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,800
Speaker 0: And we're like we left a man-trap on the beach.

33
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,154
Speaker 0: We explained what we're doing and I remember so clearly.

34
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:33,560
Speaker 0: all the parents kind of look at each other.

35
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:41,300
Speaker 0: And then one of the dads was like oh shit And they like run to the beach to find this thing and dismantle it before someone died.

36
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:44,130
Speaker 1: I once made a tiny hole.

37
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,352
Speaker 1: It was only like maybe a foot deep and I was putting sticks in it upright.

38
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,479
Speaker 0: Oh, that's even worse.

39
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,960
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, at least he didn't poop on the sticks, right?

40
00:02:53,241 --> 00:03:00,030
Speaker 1: And then I went no and then I went to test it and I cut my foot a little bit Like you got a sword.

41
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,440
Speaker 0: you're like gonna test the sword.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,579
Speaker 1: He's like I didn't want to matter want to make you want to make sure someone would actually fall through the top and I just walk across safely.

43
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:12,998
Speaker 1: I cut my foot a little bit and I was like, oh, this is actually I actually made a real trap.

44
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:21,426
Speaker 0: Awesome There's definitely a young age were like swords and traps seem like the coolest thing in the world because you don't quite the world needs A lot more traps.

45
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:23,220
Speaker 1: I say yeah, not enough traps.

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,940
Speaker 1: I come alone style coolest part not even when you play D&D the place you're supposed to encounter traps.

47
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,104
Speaker 1: There aren't enough of them.

48
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:31,212
Speaker 1: people don't use traps enough instead.

49
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:41,200
Speaker 0: All we get is occasional electrified manhole Which is not cool, even when I made like burning wheel micro dungeons like for old burning cons and things I only had like two or three traps.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,204
Speaker 1: Everyone's always like.

51
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,413
Speaker 1: I check the door for traps to check the chest for traps.

52
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,220
Speaker 1: Yes, and there's never any fucking traps anywhere.

53
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,930
Speaker 1: It's like dude just trap it up.

54
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,460
Speaker 1: Come on people love traps.

55
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,728
Speaker 0: I remember long ago playing a D&D game.

56
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:54,939
Speaker 1: what you got to do is put a trap on the door where they know it's gonna be.

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
Speaker 1: But also they check they check for trap.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:11,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they they find the trap and they pick the lock and dismantle the trap and they feel all great and they're like All right, we met our trap quota and then you get him with a good old Stone rolling down the hallway trap or no, you're a step on the plate on the floor trap.

59
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,140
Speaker 0: You got a stone rolling trap that goes toward the door and it's triggered by successfully picking the lock on the door.

60
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,666
Speaker 0: I'm just saying so has a trap.

61
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,315
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you got to get him with the traps.

62
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,340
Speaker 1: They're not thinking about traps.

63
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,553
Speaker 0: We should do a gig not one.

64
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,883
Speaker 0: to an episode on traps Thursday show.

65
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,372
Speaker 1: I got nothing else to say about traps except we need more.

66
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:30,375
Speaker 0: come up with traps.

67
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:31,279
Speaker 1: Let's trap people.

68
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:38,454
Speaker 0: Yeah Next episode of gig nights why rim and scott are in jail.

69
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:39,820
Speaker 1: podcast from jail.

70
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,099
Speaker 0: So anyway, I super interrupted you on your thing of the day.

71
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:46,919
Speaker 1: Oh, this guy's in Australia and he's digging a hole in the sand, but not to put a trap in it.

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,498
Speaker 1: Well, although digging a hole in the sand is this deep may be dangerous to yourself.

73
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:52,900
Speaker 1: Don't yeah?

74
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:57,400
Speaker 0: Oh, seriously, a lot of kids die every year by digging holes in the piece.

75
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Speaker 1: Danger imagine if you're at six feet tall and you did like I'm 511 right and I dig a hole in the sand.

76
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:14,107
Speaker 1: It's like eight feet and I go in and then the sand caves in on me if it's covering my head and I People can't pull me out of there.

77
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:14,749
Speaker 0: They're done.

78
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,174
Speaker 1: I die the end.

79
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:17,900
Speaker 1: So anyway, this guy digs a hole in the sand.

80
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:34,881
Speaker 1: it's deep enough to stand in for sure and His goal is to make sort of like an underground Living shed tent area a to you people make something you'll see like depending on certain beaches people like bring tents or bring portable huts or Like.

81
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:41,371
Speaker 0: they'll make a semi-permanent structure for like their month-long beach vacation Like that's where they go hang out every day and they leave their beach stuff in the shade.

82
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,600
Speaker 0: This is that plus a basement.

83
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:50,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, he made a two stories of basement Followed by a hut on the surface area the surface level.

84
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:51,847
Speaker 0: I want to.

85
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,400
Speaker 0: I just want to go to a beach where I'm living.

86
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,293
Speaker 0: I'm hanging out at the beach long enough to where this is a feasible idea.

87
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:00,499
Speaker 1: I want to lock the door and then fill it with water because traps.

88
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:07,398
Speaker 0: I Did not expect you to bring it back so soon.

89
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,526
Speaker 0: So my thing today is definitely not a trap.

90
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:21,899
Speaker 0: so, you know, there's a genre of YouTube video that is someone plays a song Accompanied by a thing that is not a musical instrument like a washing machine that makes a weird noise.

91
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:30,227
Speaker 0: or there's a famous one of this like country band playing a song where there's this tractor idling and the tractor idling is the drums for The song.

92
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,019
Speaker 0: that kind of thing.

93
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker 0: This video is one of those and you'll see those videos are all linked here.

94
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:42,420
Speaker 0: Like there'll be the recommended videos for you probably But this escalates so far beyond what you expect.

95
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:53,320
Speaker 0: So there's a thing that'll happen if you have shitty pipes in certain kinds of like old pipe fixtures Where if you turn the faucet on to certain points the pipes will drone like they'll make a droning sound

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,300
Speaker 1: Because the speed of the water going through resonates with the pipe and makes it shake and vibrate.

97
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:04,840
Speaker 0: Yeah Coupled with the mechanism of the faucet kind of like how you can get water hammers and all those other things that'll happen.

98
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:08,560
Speaker 0: Oh water hammers water hammers are bad fucking news, but they're fun.

99
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:15,532
Speaker 0: They are fun until like the pipe in the basement at the apartment You're renting literally explodes because you water hammered too much.

100
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:16,797
Speaker 1: I don't live in the basement.

101
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:17,380
Speaker 1: So that's fine.

102
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,720
Speaker 0: But there's another thing they'll do where they'll do that in a rhythm and all sorts of nonsense can happen with pipes.

103
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,180
Speaker 0: So my video is simply and you just have to watch it triple concerto for faucet water pipes and fiddle.

104
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,900
Speaker 0: And when you start watching this you'll think all right, that's pretty cool.

105
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:37,965
Speaker 0: And then he escalates it a little bit.

106
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:45,025
Speaker 0: he incorporates the water pipes and the faucet to a degree that is Really legit.

107
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,451
Speaker 0: like this is good stuff here.

108
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,660
Speaker 0: This is one of my favorite things that I have ever found.

109
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 0: We watched it over the weekend and it's pretty good.

110
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,534
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll put it as the stinger instead of weird internet shit this time.

111
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:59,195
Speaker 0: Hmm So I in the meta moment the booklet book is Frank Herbert's Dune.

112
00:07:59,215 --> 00:07:59,959
Speaker 1: I started reading.

113
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:02,879
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read start reading it like this weekend.

114
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:07,360
Speaker 0: Uh We'll see how Doonie we get maybe a live tweet.

115
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:15,824
Speaker 1: I just want to say like, you know I'm a nerd who knows about Dune even though I never finished reading it before and haven't read it at all since middle school and In just chapter one.

116
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,591
Speaker 1: They've already introduced every single proper noun.

117
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,877
Speaker 1: I've ever heard anyone used to talk about Dune.

118
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:28,345
Speaker 0: So on a scale of Cat in the Hat as a zero and prince and nothing is cat in the Hat zero I don't know.

119
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,249
Speaker 0: It's cat hat.

120
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,415
Speaker 1: You don't like cat in the Hat.

121
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,400
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I don't like it.

122
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 0: I'm saying the number of proper nouns introduced in that book approaches zero.

123
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,818
Speaker 0: Oh, it's true come for Anna tan is the prince of nothing.

124
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,687
Speaker 0: Where does Dune sit for you so far?

125
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,216
Speaker 1: Well, it's not the number of proper nouns.

126
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:50,380
Speaker 1: It's that a Unlike Prince of Nothing which uses the price say this when we do the book of episode again.

127
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, but Prince of Nothing uses proper nouns that have been invented based on languages of the world.

128
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:03,105
Speaker 1: So you can sort of get a feel of like a Latin root or something on a lot of words to sort of guess at Their meanings like I'll sort of tell.

129
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:07,458
Speaker 1: that feels like the name of a place that feels like the name of a person.

130
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,380
Speaker 1: that Feels sort of like, you know Middle Eastern kind of word, right?

131
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:18,790
Speaker 0: That kind of thing where and that's all consistent like the aesthetic is Consistent so you can make inferences inferences that make sense.

132
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:24,916
Speaker 1: the words in the proper nouns in Dune had Their their structure gives you no sense to their meaning.

133
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:29,371
Speaker 1: the best Sam a flange right and then it's.

134
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:33,860
Speaker 1: sometimes some of them get explained And some of them are just like all right.

135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,718
Speaker 1: There's a proper now and I have to wait till I see it again And then once they explain it come back and read this again To see what the hell they were saying.

136
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,698
Speaker 0: Otherwise you should go to Scott's YouTube channel and my youtube channel because we're both uploaded a lot of stuff.

137
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:50,089
Speaker 0: Yeah Utena show is coming back.

138
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,373
Speaker 0: I think I talked about this last time but This Wednesday, so I really want to bring it up again.

139
00:09:54,876 --> 00:10:02,692
Speaker 0: as you know We haven't done a geek nice presents Utena analysis episode in a while And part of that is because half the fucking videos were taken down by copyright.

140
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:04,800
Speaker 0: I have done the work.

141
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:08,673
Speaker 0: I filed like 50 notifications and counter notifications.

142
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:14,075
Speaker 0: all of the series We've done to date is back on YouTube free and clear.

143
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:14,979
Speaker 0: you can watch them.

144
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:20,235
Speaker 0: So finally we can start the production pipeline up again pretty much right after Kinetic on.

145
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:28,907
Speaker 0: so like middle of July We're gonna start making the Utena videos again, like everything the stars are aligned and When he gets the news, we'll talk about it.

146
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:31,379
Speaker 0: It's a good time to start doing the Utena stuff again.

147
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,620
Speaker 0: I'm feeling Utena a lot lately.

148
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,124
Speaker 1: You should also follow us and all the places on the internet that you can follow people Twitter Right.

149
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:47,091
Speaker 1: We even have a Facebook that There are some people that go there.

150
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:53,117
Speaker 1: it's really just messages that are automatic like hey new episode Like g-plus like there's comments in there and stuff.

151
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:57,180
Speaker 0: I guess We get a lot of fans.

152
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:05,109
Speaker 1: We also I have a geek nice Instagram account that I haven't used but I think like for now like when we do stuff like Go to a convention or there's a geek night's activity.

153
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,474
Speaker 1: I'll post some photos there.

154
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:13,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll find me Where I post like okay like old episodes and like things there and that has like its own feeds.

155
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,909
Speaker 0: The moral is we have fans.

156
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,280
Speaker 1: I mean you're already listening to the stupid podcast.

157
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:21,399
Speaker 1: It's kind of the wrong place to spread this message.

158
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:29,949
Speaker 1: Yeah But then again I think like there's a lot of people to all those places and tell you and in each of the places talk about all the Other places we have like a forum community.

159
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,560
Speaker 0: That's kind of separate from our YouTube community Which is separate from like the people in iTunes.

160
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can go to the forum also at front.

161
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:39,122
Speaker 0: recruit calm our forums pretty baller Like it's.

165
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,529
Speaker 1: For discussion, oh you're about to meet right?

166
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might have rejected people who might have been real people.

167
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,278
Speaker 1: You have to write something in there that like lets us know that.

168

173
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,554
Speaker 1: if you write something else you won't get approved.

174
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,944
Speaker 0: and also if you go to my youtube channel We started doing this.

175
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:31,240

Speaker 0: Anyway, so like fucking I'll just do it.

177
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,074
Speaker 0: We live stream like most of the geek nights episodes like as we record them.

178
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:38,680
Speaker 0: I'm also live streaming them.

179
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:39,947

Speaker 0: We record straight to tape like geek nights is not edited the lie.

190
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,697
Speaker 0: The only difference between the live stream and the podcast is that one the live stream.

191
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:16,300
Speaker 0: you see our faces.

192
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,839
Speaker 0: You see that we don't look at each other and the Scott has his eyes closed for most of the show.

193
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:20,503
Speaker 1: What's there?

194
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:23,340
Speaker 0: look at rims head now the back of my head because we don't even look at each other.

195
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:38,093
Speaker 0: my like thinning hairline right there, but You also see when we pause in the middle of the episode and transfer from like news bit to main bit And occasionally you'll see us trying to figure out what the hell to do the show on.

196
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:39,760
Speaker 0: so there's biz in there.

197
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,406
Speaker 0: Oh, the chat just keeps going.

198
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:43,209
Speaker 0: I can't keep up with that.

199
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:47,228
Speaker 1: So otherwise ten people such it's such a chat You couldn't possibly keep up with.

200
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:48,818
Speaker 0: well cuz I gotta look here to do that.

201
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,168
Speaker 0: But I gotta look here to get ready for the next bit of the show.

202
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,273
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

203
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:52,514
Speaker 0: Woo.

204
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:53,277
Speaker 0: He read my comment.

205
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:53,819
Speaker 0: They're excited.

206
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,037
Speaker 0: We're averaging one message a minute.

207
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:04,199
Speaker 0: The most people we've ever had watched the show live at one time was like 30 and I was during the barbecue episode.

208
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,381
Speaker 0: cuz I guess food Somebody.

209
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:07,851
Speaker 0: if we just did geek night's food.

210
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,019
Speaker 0: I think we'd actually have more fans.

211
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,733
Speaker 1: Probably said the cameras in the kitchen, you know, we don't know anything about food.

212
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:14,380
Speaker 1: I know how to cook some things.

213
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know how to cook some things.

214
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,140
Speaker 0: I don't know how to do like a food show though, cuz I don't know it's like the barbecue show.

215
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,424
Speaker 0: We don't shit about barbecue.

216
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:23,836
Speaker 0: No, so I guess let's get right into it with our anime news roundup.

217
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:25,380
Speaker 0: So first things first.

218
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:40,100
Speaker 0: Uh Utena was a manga by Chiyo Saito and an anime by B Pappas which is sort of like a collaboration of Chiyo Saito and Ikuhara and all these other like important people and It's kind of like a unique and magic show.

219
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,923
Speaker 0: There's a reason we did.

220
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,935
Speaker 0: we're doing like an entire YouTube chat like show around trying to analyze this.

221
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:49,279
Speaker 0: It's like the Hawthorne Anime, like there's nothing else like it.

222
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:59,052
Speaker 0: but if you got really into Utena, you might have read the manga like Ostensibly, it is a big part of the source material of Utena and you might have wondered why.

223
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,476
Speaker 0: it's completely different.

224
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:09,360
Speaker 0: and like Utena's Dating Toga and like no one appears to be or Toga was dating Juri like no one's homosexual.

225
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,286
Speaker 1: It's no one's incestual.

226
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:24,106
Speaker 0: It's real simple and not at all like the show and It is definitely important and there's a lot of reasons to talk about Chiyo Saito and like all these things But most fans of Utena don't really talk much about the manga.

227
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:28,887
Speaker 0: the manga is real old and It's coming back.

228
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:33,448
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a new Original Utena manga.

229
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:36,099
Speaker 1: So wait Chiyo Saito is writing and drawing this.

230
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:37,924
Speaker 1: Someone else.

231
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,980
Speaker 0: so B Pappas blah blah blah develop the manga and anime at the same time.

232
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:44,011
Speaker 0: I didn't actually read this article yet.

233
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:45,439
Speaker 1: Who's making this manga?

234
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:46,947
Speaker 1: What's it about?

235
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:47,452
Speaker 1: is it brand?

236
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,400
Speaker 1: is it starting from scratch?

237
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,301
Speaker 1: We're picking up at the as just the next volume of the manga like Utena volume Whatever.

238
00:15:52,783 --> 00:16:02,831
Speaker 0: this year's July issue of Shogakukan's flowers magazine announced on Saturday that a new Utena manga will run In the September issue on July 28th.

239
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:05,180
Speaker 0: Chiyo Saito is drawing the new manga.

240
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,971
Speaker 0: Writing it does not say she's writing it just drawing.

241
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:09,734
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

242
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,279
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it means she's doing it.

243
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:16,418
Speaker 0: Uh, and no one knows like more details than that as far as I can tell.

244
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:19,089
Speaker 1: well I'm sure it'll be scans laid in like two seconds.

245
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:19,692
Speaker 0: Yep.

246
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:21,299
Speaker 0: So, uh, I don't know.

247
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:24,020
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll give Scott the Utena manga so we can read it.

248
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,739
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll review it cuz I read it a long time ago Back when I was ultra obsessed with trying to like analyze Utena the first time I watched it.

249
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:44,595
Speaker 0: But uh, it's just really interesting that this is having more like old properties are coming back and oftentimes Original talent are involved again, and I feel like there's a new wave of nostalgia.

250
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,180
Speaker 1: That's the opposite of in America.

251
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:51,580
Speaker 1: Everything's coming back and has been coming back for many years now, but the original talent is not the ones doing it.

252
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,235
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, what spider-man movie has been written by Stan Lee.

253
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,536
Speaker 1: none.

254
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:56,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, none.

255
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:58,183
Speaker 0: Not a wonder.

256
00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:02,280
Speaker 0: part of this is that the anime industry is starting to pick up again in a big way in Japan.

257
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:11,330
Speaker 0: It has its problems obviously with monetization and like the there's the industry might not be healthy But it's growing again, which wasn't the trend like ten years ago.

258
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:16,382
Speaker 0: So I wonder if that might be driving a Re-plumbing.

259
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,084
Speaker 1: I think it's only.

260
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:21,035
Speaker 1: it's only able to grow because of the abuse of the employees.

261
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:27,480
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah working at slave wages They actually had to pay animators and and artists their amount of money that they deserve.

262
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:30,617
Speaker 1: There would be much less but much higher quality anime and manga.

263
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:47,122
Speaker 0: of course you know once we've reviewed the new Little Witch Academia TV show because there might be a model where American companies like Netflix finance the creation of anime and go big-budget and pay people that might actually soup like Little Wish Academia.

264
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:48,546
Speaker 1: Or the executives take all the money.

265
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:52,857
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and the in-betweeners are still outsourced to some rando country.

266
00:17:53,017 --> 00:18:02,749
Speaker 0: I feel like Companies like Netflix investing in anime style or animation or things like this might really disrupt the Japanese Industry.

267
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,334
Speaker 1: We'll see.

268
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,448
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, it's just it's kind of I would have.

269
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:14,898
Speaker 0: until I read this news which is recent I would never have thought that there would ever be another Utena ever.

270
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:25,404
Speaker 1: Yeah Imagine like, you know That's like hearing like oh Yeah That thing that ended and was done for like your band that favorite band that broke up or you know What's another thing that ended?

271
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:26,369
Speaker 1: Oh, there's gonna be.

272
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,720
Speaker 0: there's gonna be cowboy bebop - fuck it.

273
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're just gonna pick up off where episode.

274
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:32,560
Speaker 1: it's episode 27.

275
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,816
Speaker 0: There's a spin-off IO AV edit cowboy cowgirl ed and I'm gav.

276
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:40,348
Speaker 0: magical adventures Like that, that's kind of what this is like.

277
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,456
Speaker 1: I guess this happened already is called Star War.

278
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:49,428
Speaker 1: Yeah By the way, it's been like it's many years but Star War It's like when I was a kid.

279
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,997
Speaker 0: until episode one was announced I just assumed the Star Wars was a complete thing that was done forever.

280
00:18:55,178 --> 00:19:02,220
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm When Star Wars one was announced that was possibly the most excited I had ever been about anything ever.

281
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,840
Speaker 1: That episode one trailer is still like, you know, the movie was garbage.

282
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:11,229
Speaker 1: But that trailer for episode one was like the most might be the most watched trailer there ever was Yeah

283
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,323
Speaker 0: like someone

284
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,758
Speaker 1: we were downloading real media files and carrying them around so you can watch it like

285
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:23,780
Speaker 0: a BBS posted like there's gonna be a new Star Wars movie and I didn't fucking believe the guy until I saw the trailer myself

286
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,459
Speaker 1: Watching that I had a 486. we were watching that little video file.

287
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:29,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were.

288
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:37,859
Speaker 0: we used to wait like when we watch try gun at what 40p It's 40 I 20 pixels interlaced is bad.

289
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:41,540
Speaker 0: So in some other news, this is sort of related to Japan.

290
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,507
Speaker 0: But there was apparently you know, the answer man is a column on anime news network And I thought that column ended but I guess not.

291
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:57,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't remember cuz I don't follow it that often Much attention, I usually only since anime news Nina ended I stopped paying attention to yeah, but I answer man is always pretty good.

292
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:02,240
Speaker 0: But they did a thing recently on like what do Taku or otaku or like in Japan?

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:10,240
Speaker 1: discussion is so old and I've read like so many things about where the word came from and what it means and what it Means what it meant before and all etymology.

294
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:15,420
Speaker 1: I've read everything there is to read about that and my memory doesn't serve me that well.

295
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,779
Speaker 0: But you know, I read all the things you would probably say if you were off-the-cuff told to explain that.

296
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,220
Speaker 0: yeah And the internet reacted and to have sort of a retraction slash follow-up.

297
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:36,820
Speaker 0: basically, none of the very few people in America have been paying a lot of attention to the fact that Anime fandom in Japan has actually changed a lot in the last decade.

298
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:45,069
Speaker 0: Okay and there appears to be a lot of evidence that it is actually turning a lot more into like what American anime fandom was like in the 90s.

299
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:48,020
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm in that it's a lot more social.

300
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:51,435
Speaker 0: There's a lot more girls and women who are in the fandom.

301
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:52,500
Speaker 0: Oh people are more.

302
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:53,606
Speaker 1: I knew that.

303
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,960
Speaker 1: just look at the yellow petals in the high cues.

304
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,805
Speaker 1: Yeah freeze in the area and ices.

305
00:20:57,845 --> 00:21:03,808
Speaker 0: but it talks about like the growth of otome road and ike bukuro and like for Joshi content being Produced more and more and more.

306
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:04,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how?

307
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:18,257
Speaker 0: like we know about that We're like movies like your name actually like kind of showed that anime is like getting legit mainstream But the biggest change seems to be that the stereotype of like super ultra shut-in hikikomori like those people exist.

308
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:30,054
Speaker 0: but anime like fan conventions in Japan and fan gatherings are becoming more and more social like they are in the US Mmm, and that is all fascinating.

309
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:30,840
Speaker 0: You can read this article.

310
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:42,918
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna read the article to you, but it is fascinating to see this column sort of retract the 90s 2000s view of what Japanese anime and manga fandom was like.

311
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Speaker 0: and Actually, look at what it really is like today in 2017 because you know the world changes and stuffs different today.

312
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:57,160
Speaker 1: I think there's enough people that speak Japanese and English and are in both places that they could like he was more up-to-date on these sorts of things.

313
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:00,180
Speaker 0: But again, remember that art that book I read on the Battle of Midway.

314
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:12,838
Speaker 1: Like if I spoke a different language and went to another country, like I don't know what if I spoke Lebanese and hang out in Lebanon I would be keeping everyone in the English-speaking world up-to-date on what the fuck it's like in Lebanon now.

315
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,125
Speaker 0: and shit people Translating primaries.

316
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:19,797
Speaker 0: or remember the thing with the pirates in Japan like some they've translated some French document.

317
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:28,280
Speaker 0: They were like, oh shit There's history in here that we just never looked at because none of us bothered reading a translation of this thing that happens all the time.

318
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:35,980
Speaker 0: Language barriers actually really prevent like information exchange to this day and it's not because we can't translate there's no one bothers.

319
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,108
Speaker 1: Scott is now king of world.

320
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,540
Speaker 1: Everyone must learn Esperanto and Lojban.

321
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:45,130
Speaker 1: Only two only two approved languages.

322
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,320
Speaker 1: no more speaking any old stupid human languages.

323
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:53,820
Speaker 0: So this is probably the most important link I got here because this is a there's two big deal items.

324
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:55,487
Speaker 1: I don't know how confirmed this is.

325
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:58,240
Speaker 1: It's a picture of a poster on a wall somewhere.

326
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:01,428
Speaker 0: No, no get Genco booth at the film.

327
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:05,438
Speaker 0: some film festival revealed that like this is announced.

328
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:05,980
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

329
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:11,996
Speaker 0: So the two big things are Pluto which might be one of the best comics ever written.

330
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,532
Speaker 1: No, it's up Sure top hundred top 50 maybe.

331
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:20,208
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe Pluto's real fucking good.

332
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:23,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially because of the context of what it is.

333
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,485
Speaker 1: I think that's part of its.

334
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:26,492
Speaker 1: that's part of the weakness of Pluto is.

335
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:30,185
Speaker 1: maybe one of its a few weaknesses is that you have To understand the context.

336
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:33,736
Speaker 1: Otherwise a lot of it is lost on you, but I'll give you context.

337
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:34,840
Speaker 1: right after him stops talking.

338
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:35,262
Speaker 0: I'll stop.

339
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:35,824
Speaker 0: I was waiting for you.

340
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:36,307
Speaker 0: keep talking.

341
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:36,688
Speaker 0: go for it.

342
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,155
Speaker 1: Oh you wanted the context of Pluto.

343
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:45,677
Speaker 1: All right, so Astroboy effectively like the first anime the first real manga.

344
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:52,476
Speaker 1: maybe right anyway In Astro boy, right there is a story a sub story right that takes place.

345
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:56,319
Speaker 1: and in this story There is a robot named Pluto and he's bad guy.

346
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:56,701
Speaker 1: He's.

347
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,954
Speaker 1: he wants to be the strongest robot there is on the whole earth, right?

348
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:01,180
Speaker 1: So he goes around.

349
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:11,979
Speaker 1: So he goes around to all the other awesome robots on the earth who are the awesomest by the way And who are supposedly the strongest robots like Mont Blanc the mountaineer?

350
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:20,609
Speaker 1: And my favorite guy Botar who's the robot who takes care of the children And many other really badass robots.

351
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:28,489
Speaker 1: and he he says come out here you awesome robot I had to fight you and beat you to prove that I'm the strongest robot there is because that's what I want to be.

352
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:29,835
Speaker 1: the strongest robot there is.

353
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:33,640
Speaker 1: and Astro boy, of course is on the hit list, right?

354
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,853
Speaker 1: And in this story what takes place is basically Something that is now the tropest of tropes.

355
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:47,934
Speaker 1: the good guy gets defeated Powers up and comes back stronger than before.

356
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:55,534
Speaker 1: Astro boy gets beat up spoilers He goes back and he gets upgraded from like however many horsepower.

357
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,540
Speaker 1: He was before up to a million.

358
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:05,481
Speaker 1: I forget what the exact number is But it just pretend that he used to be a thousand horsepower and is now a million horsepower and he comes back Right.

359
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:08,971
Speaker 1: and you see that happen in every anime ever.

360
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,498
Speaker 1: Oh, no Goku got defeated.

361
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:12,100
Speaker 1: He'll come back.

362
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,973
Speaker 1: He's super saiyan.

363
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:16,393
Speaker 1: now Right, you can see that in real.

364
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:25,649
Speaker 1: it's like this is the North star or like every single shonen story and a lot of other stories right Your superhero?

365
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,115
Speaker 1: or even even in non super stories Somebody is the main character on their journey.

366
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:33,520
Speaker 1: his face is a setback.

367
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:44,810
Speaker 1: They go and train and level up somehow and they come back right and Pluto is as far as I can tell like the first main Exact.

368
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:52,740
Speaker 1: I can't find an older Example of that trope that is so clear and distinct that every later thing, you know borrows from right?

369
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:54,892
Speaker 0: So but it's just one like story.

370
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:56,200
Speaker 0: It's like an arc in Astro boy, right?

371
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,500
Speaker 1: So it's just a story arc in Astro boy that this happens in but it establishes this trope for all time, right?

372
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:07,560
Speaker 1: So if you look at all the other iterations of Astro boy, right the different anime series all three of them

373
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,831
Speaker 0: I think the 80s one might be the most like the

374
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:15,234
Speaker 1: 80s the 80s rendition of that story I think is the best one I've seen compared to the black and white 60s one in the 2000s.

375
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,779
Speaker 1: One in the 2000s was Pluto's like completely different.

376
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:25,438
Speaker 1: but What happened was is this story was retold yet again, right?

377
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,720
Speaker 1: Urasawa the manga artist who made 20 century boys Monster Billy Bat, which I'm still waiting for in English.

378
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:34,642
Speaker 0: I haven't read it.

379
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:35,384
Speaker 1: right?

380
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:41,178
Speaker 1: all these all these terrific amazing master Keaton, right all these amazing mangas, right?

381
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:45,169
Speaker 1: He made Pluto which was how many volumes is it?

382
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,337
Speaker 0: I have I don't even remember have all the volumes.

383
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,180
Speaker 1: It's published in English.

384
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,203
Speaker 0: You can read it again.

385
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:54,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget if it's eight or ten volumes or whatever, but it basically retells that story of Pluto.

386
00:26:55,461 --> 00:27:04,184
Speaker 1: But eight book volume in eight volumes and obviously it's in the art style of Right cuz.

387
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:05,248
Speaker 1: he's drawing and writing it.

388
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:12,919
Speaker 1: but instead of telling the story from the perspective of Astro boy, it tells the story from the perspective of guess act.

389
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:14,363
Speaker 1: I think that's how you say it.

390
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:24,751
Speaker 1: G E S I C H T the German detective robot who is in the original story Just one of the super badass robots that is on the hit list of Pluto.

391
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:28,640
Speaker 0: and it is just such a beautifully told nuanced story.

392
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:33,962
Speaker 1: Yep, so he's easy retelling that exact same story again right?

393
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:52,780
Speaker 1: yet, you know dread, you know by expanding it so much and now able to go into the details and Characterize, you know really get into all the characters and explore You know, the sick character a whole lot more than you know The what few pages he had in the very original, right?

394
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,122
Speaker 1: So there you go.

395
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,667
Speaker 1: Also Astro boy itself.

396
00:27:55,727 --> 00:28:01,265
Speaker 1: The manga has been almost or has been entirely reprinted now Recently by dark horse.

397
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:04,800
Speaker 1: It used to be you could get it in these tiny little volumes and needed a whole bunch of them.

398
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:07,329
Speaker 1: They printed Astro boy omnibus.

399
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:08,192
Speaker 1: you buy these books.

400
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:10,240
Speaker 1: I think maybe like eight or nine.

401
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,410
Speaker 1: I forget how many they made.

402
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:19,625
Speaker 1: I have a whole bunch of them And it's all of the Astro boy manga in English and it's like these fat books I still got.

403
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:20,869
Speaker 0: I have all of dr.

404
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,378
Speaker 0: Slump, but I only made it like three volumes into that.

405
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,646
Speaker 0: Good luck I gotta start bringing that on flights.

406
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,855
Speaker 0: You start paging through it slumping it.

407
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:30,465
Speaker 0: I didn't even finish crew Marty I got a ton of that too.

408
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:31,008
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

409
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:32,093
Speaker 0: I love from party.

410
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,640
Speaker 1: You want to see my unread mangas?

411
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,386
Speaker 1: No, you're like rims got like rims.

412
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:37,792
Speaker 1: Like I got two unread mangas.

413
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:38,295
Speaker 1: I'm like, uh-huh.

414
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:48,860
Speaker 0: All right Let me show you my unread mangas, but yeah, so This anime is gonna be real interesting and we're gonna we're gonna keep an eye on thing.

415
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:49,563
Speaker 1: Is is like.

416
00:28:49,603 --> 00:29:02,460
Speaker 0: on the one hand it's exciting to popularize Pluto again but on the other hand I hated the monster anime only because The manga was so good and the anime was just the exact same thing plus music, right?

417
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,420
Speaker 1: So is Pluto gonna be the exact same thing as the manga in which case which urasawa is directly involved?

418
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,306
Speaker 0: So the answer is probably we need it.

419
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,570
Speaker 1: Is it necessary?

420
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,693
Speaker 1: I just want to see.

421
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:12,977
Speaker 1: you know, this is good stuff.

422
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,204
Speaker 0: controversial opinion I think.

423
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:24,843
Speaker 0: on one hand monster popularized urasawa's work and probably got more people to go read his manga, but the counterpoint is that it is Literally redundant.

424
00:29:24,903 --> 00:29:31,019
Speaker 0: if you've read the comic like if you like because I had read monster the anime had nothing for me.

425
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,180
Speaker 1: Of course nothing, you know urasawa's other work.

426
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,146
Speaker 1: I didn't mention that I want the most.

427
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,812
Speaker 1: that is the hardest to get in English.

428
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:41,380
Speaker 1: is Yaura fashionable, you know?

429
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,010
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I was forget about that one and it's not easy to get in English.

430
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:47,484
Speaker 1: So manga or anime.

431
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:52,478
Speaker 0: so the other thing that's coming back is there's gonna be a new Patlabor.

432
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:56,415
Speaker 1: Oh shit There's always new Patlabor's reason they don't let it.

433
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:57,340
Speaker 0: she is involved.

434
00:29:57,601 --> 00:30:01,080
Speaker 1: He was only involved with a few Patlabor's the first two movies and the OAV.

435
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Speaker 1: He wasn't involved with the TV series or the third movie or the mini Pato or any of that other stuff that came after.

436
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:08,673
Speaker 1: There was you know, there's some other things.

437
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:09,480
Speaker 1: there's a lot of action.

438
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,426
Speaker 0: I always thought he was.

439
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:12,238
Speaker 1: I don't think he had anything to do with live-action.

440
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:12,519
Speaker 1: one.

441
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:15,760
Speaker 0: I always thought he was involved in the TV show, but that wasn't based on knowledge.

442
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,599
Speaker 0: That was just me assuming which often happens.

443
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,083
Speaker 1: No but some of the.

444
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:29,840
Speaker 1: there are a few TV episodes that are oshi s that clearly he took inspiration from the Oshi days or maybe he was secretly involved with just a handful of them or you know.

445
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:36,139
Speaker 1: Some of his materials leaked into there, but mostly now he wasn't and I think he's on the credits list for the TV series.

446
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:38,991
Speaker 1: Yep, but yeah, Patlabor is the shit.

447
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,598
Speaker 0: Patlabor easy easy.

448
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:40,678
Speaker 0: Why?

449
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,102
Speaker 1: Alright, is it?

450
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:46,939
Speaker 1: and the thing is is the original Patlabor characters or is it like all new, you know?

451
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,852
Speaker 0: Just well, I have to so all we know.

452
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:56,400
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell One of those things we're like they'll just take the same concept of yo It's a world where labors are and just make all new characters.

453
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,853
Speaker 1: But the thing that makes Patlabor great is the original character else.

454
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:01,540
Speaker 1: That's what people care about.

455
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,465
Speaker 1: I don't care about the student.

456
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,600
Speaker 0: robots got that same kind of dynamic that like I care about the chief.

457
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:13,051
Speaker 0: These are way different shows but there's a certain kind of dynamic that you see in things like here is Greenwood or Tank Police of like.

458
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:19,334
Speaker 0: this comes a certain kind of like camaraderie Among people who are ostensibly all on the same team doing.

459
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:33,214
Speaker 1: they're like workaday job But it brings in the humor but also the seriousness and also the greater They're in the world at large, but also, you know the small All right The micro interactions like even like the original Ghost in the Shell.

460
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:34,419
Speaker 0: manga had a lot of that.

461
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:36,589
Speaker 1: Some of it some of it but did that?

462
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:39,140
Speaker 0: because that does not exist in most of the rest of Ghost in the Shell.

463
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,069
Speaker 0: It's only like the first manga.

464
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:45,777
Speaker 1: I think standalone complex has it more even than the first month Yeah, but central complex is a little more serious.

465
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,158
Speaker 0: It has less of like the major literally puts a car bomb in Aramaki's car because fuck you.

466
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:52,940
Speaker 0: You didn't give me a raise.

467
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:54,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

468
00:31:55,002 --> 00:32:00,260
Speaker 0: But we all we know is and I'm quoting this is the English text that was on the poster at their booth.

469
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:07,060
Speaker 0: With the rapidly accelerating development of hyper technology a humanoid type robot called labor is being used in every field of industry.

470
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,545
Speaker 1: That's the story of Patlabor.

471
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:09,168
Speaker 1: Yep.

472
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:13,511
Speaker 0: Okay special vehicle section number two, uh-huh That's it like that.

473
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:14,198
Speaker 0: That's all we know.

474
00:32:15,003 --> 00:32:17,294
Speaker 1: Well, that's the story of Patla the original Patlabor.

475
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,520
Speaker 0: So we have no idea.

476
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,332
Speaker 0: It's just gonna be more Patlabor, but there's big big real names behind it.

477
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:23,616
Speaker 0: Like it's a fully funded project.

478
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:24,198
Speaker 0: It looks like.

479
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,203
Speaker 1: so They just keep.

480
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:27,970
Speaker 1: my can't let go of that Patlabor.

481
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,500
Speaker 1: They keep bringing it back only like the tiny bit at a time.

482
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,425
Speaker 1: They just can't let go.

483
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:37,740
Speaker 0: there was even that live-action that no one I know watched Mmm, in fact, I didn't know it existed until I knew it existed.

484
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,114
Speaker 1: But how was I gonna watch it if I knew I forgot?

485
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:45,737
Speaker 1: so here it is Watch the Patlabor that exists, but you might not want to bother with the second TV series.

486
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:46,300
Speaker 1: It's not as good.

487
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:48,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, first TV series two movies.

488
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,211
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

489
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:50,335
Speaker 0: Was there any more?

490
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:51,380
Speaker 1: you watch the OAV?

491
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:59,539
Speaker 1: Then you watch the first movie then you watch the TV and then you watch the second movie And then you don't really need to watch anything else.

492
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:04,591
Speaker 0: The second movie is real good But it also it's way better if you've seen a lot of the other.

493
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:07,260
Speaker 1: in case I was slightly wrong about that check the internet.

494
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,970
Speaker 1: But yeah, just just watch the OAV first.

495
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,375
Speaker 0: the last time I watched any Patlabor.

496
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:12,298
Speaker 0: We still lived in Beacon.

497
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,443
Speaker 0: So so What about?

498
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:19,540
Speaker 0: one of my favorite anime ever was Gog manga biore?

499
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,398
Speaker 1: Thank you, man.

500
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,128
Speaker 0: We talked about it before.

501
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:24,780
Speaker 0: I should whenever I do a clip show at cons if pretty much always show.

502
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:28,499
Speaker 0: There's two episodes the Harris one and the one with the sticker.

503
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,594
Speaker 0: But I'm not saying this is gonna be anything like it, but I'm reminded of it.

504
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:47,560
Speaker 0: based on surface details alone There is going to be a short improv style anime and The main character is going to be Pico Taro who you know from pen pineapple apple pen.

505
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:54,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this guy is basically, you know, he's a comedian or whatever and he has one tiny hit thing.

506
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,582
Speaker 0: He had a pan AP and he had Right.

507
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:02,340
Speaker 1: his one thing became a catchy hit and now he's busy milking it for all he can which can't blame him.

508
00:34:03,044 --> 00:34:05,219
Speaker 1: And he's not doesn't seem to be a bad guy he's funny guy.

509
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:10,437
Speaker 1: I want to see how long he can hold on before he fades and do obscurity again.

510
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:17,920
Speaker 0: Pico Taro Will improvise the story of each three-minute episode using an illustration by the anime's director.

511
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:22,719
Speaker 0: He's going to tell a fairy's tale and voice every character including himself.

512
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:24,907
Speaker 1: This is he's working hard right?

513
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:25,228
Speaker 1: It's not.

514
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:25,931
Speaker 1: he's not faking it.

515
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:26,813
Speaker 1: He's putting in the efforts.

516
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:27,879
Speaker 0: This is like got talents.

517
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:37,460
Speaker 0: This is the level of like weird Improvisational comedy concept that it's not gonna be real bad or it's gonna be bad, but I'm gonna really like it.

518
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:39,127
Speaker 0: I feel like that's the way it's gonna go.

519
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:41,014
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be bad or bad, but I like it.

520
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:48,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know Oh, yeah here at the end Pico Taro is best known for his bizarre viral music video PPAP.

521
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:56,809
Speaker 0: and then in case you didn't know what that was pen pineapple apple pen and So we don't need to talk about this.

522
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,800
Speaker 0: it's the same store detail that a lot.

523
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:00,400
Speaker 0: This is the same story that happens everywhere.

524
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,805
Speaker 0: I don't have a news link for it.

525
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:13,294
Speaker 0: Anime Expo is looking for volunteers to be like walk-around translators for their guests Which is fucked up because that's a professional difficult expensive job.

526
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,160
Speaker 1: Shouldn't they hire people with money?

527
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,527
Speaker 0: that's the fucked up part.

528
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:21,184
Speaker 0: apparently they have both paid and Unpaid positions.

529
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:28,828
Speaker 0: so they're paying some people and they're asking other people to volunteer To do our crazy ton of expensive work for free.

530
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,197
Speaker 1: so don't do that job if you're not getting paid.

531
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:38,225
Speaker 0: Yeah also most people who are professional translators There's knowing a language.

532
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:44,399
Speaker 0: even being semi fluent or fluent in a language is not the same skill as being a translator That's true.

533
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:49,660
Speaker 1: And a lot of people can translate like written stuff when they have time to sit there with the dictionary and think about it.

534
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:56,600
Speaker 1: You know because they know the language enough But they do not have the skills like sit at the UN and translate as someone is talking in real time.

535
00:35:56,882 --> 00:35:58,900
Speaker 1: Yep, that is entirely different skill.

536
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,005
Speaker 1: that is much more difficult.

537
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:08,318
Speaker 0: and translating talking real time is also very different from Translating walking around in like just general day-to-day interactions with someone.

538
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:08,619
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

539
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:16,659
Speaker 0: So the moral is F these cons that try to have very specialized work be just unpaid free labor.

540
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:18,003
Speaker 1: Listen There's nothing wrong.

541
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:23,560
Speaker 1: see, you know, there's nothing wrong with someone who asks around and says hey who wants to work for free?

542
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, just stop working for fucking free.

543
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:26,852
Speaker 1: Stop it.

544
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:28,198
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

545
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:34,540
Speaker 1: Yep And if someone doesn't pay you right you said they said they were gonna pay you and they don't stop working.

546
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:36,446
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe it's your passion.

547
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:42,083
Speaker 0: I mean I volunteer like I do free work for things occasionally, but I know I'm doing It's also.

548
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:48,860
Speaker 0: I do it super on purpose and I don't have unreasonable expectations about that becoming something like real later.

549
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:55,000
Speaker 0: Do it and volunteering for this if you're not already a professional will probably not give you the experience to be in New York.

550
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:08,020
Speaker 1: We actually recently there was a new law recently that to make it easier when freelance If you someone hires freelancers and doesn't pay them, it's easier not to go after them to get your fucking money Yep, and it's harder for them to not pay.

551
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:16,129
Speaker 0: So also, uh, we've never been to anime Expo and partly because never based on all accounts It is the worst anime con to go to in the u.s.

552
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:23,711
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell it's a really crowded mostly professional not fan Yeah, black and then like if you like anime go to anime Boston.

553
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:25,457
Speaker 0: It's probably the best anime con in the u.s.

554
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:25,958
Speaker 1: Even Oda.

555
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:29,758
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, which is at least fan run even though industry presence is large.

556
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:38,752
Speaker 0: Yep I think I anime Boston is smaller than Otakon, but I also think it's a lot better run based on Previous experience coupled with current anecdotal evidence.

557
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:39,354
Speaker 0: Hmm.

558
00:37:39,615 --> 00:37:39,936
Speaker 0: Frankly.

559
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:40,960
Speaker 0: We didn't go to either this year.

560
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,895
Speaker 0: Just cuz too busy like we got like going on.

561
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:52,120
Speaker 0: but Yeah In terms of other things coming back Many of you have probably seen project echo like the original project echo.

562
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:57,540
Speaker 1: Some people might not have heard of it But project echo is a big deal because it was one of the animes on the sci-fi channel.

563
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,317
Speaker 1: So all the oldest all the nerds who found anime in those days know about it.

564
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:03,120
Speaker 0: people our age.

565
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:14,527
Speaker 0: This is like the third anime they ever saw right but anyone newer anime fans might not know what the hell it is at all Just like if you've listened to geek nights like project echo We've talked about a lot at least in older episodes.

566
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:19,942
Speaker 0: and here's the thing most people who even know what project echo is Don't know.

567
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:24,477
Speaker 0: there was actually based on what was supposed to be porn, but it's not porn.

568
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:25,500
Speaker 0: It's actually just a comedy.

569
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:35,361
Speaker 0: it's actually a really funny comedy and It's also a very like like I didn't realize it was making fun of like fist of the North Star and all this other anime Cuz.

570
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:39,525
Speaker 0: I'd never seen another anime before when I first saw it But it's legit funny.

571
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:45,159
Speaker 0: Like it's a funny show, but most people know it as this one movie Which is actually no AV.

572
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,540
Speaker 0: It's like one story about these weird characters in this high school and superpowers and stuff.

573
00:38:51,343 --> 00:39:00,240
Speaker 0: If you're a little more inside baseball or a little more pro You might know that there was a like double feature movie project gray and project blue.

574
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:04,016
Speaker 0: I think that is the same characters but like alternate universe.

575
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:07,209
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm What most of you probably don't know is there.

576
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:11,365
Speaker 0: there is a whole ton of other Project echo avs.

577
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:12,809
Speaker 0: there's episode two three and four.

578
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:14,594
Speaker 0: I've seen all of them.

579
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:20,511
Speaker 0: I don't think they've been Legally able to be seen in the US since the 80s.

580
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,293
Speaker 1: Are they any good?

581
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:23,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just as funny as part one.

582
00:39:24,023 --> 00:39:25,711
Speaker 0: Like I've rented them all from block.

583
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,600
Speaker 0: Well, I rented two of them from blockbuster.

584
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:31,620
Speaker 0: I got a bootleg like fan sub of the third one.

585
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:46,413
Speaker 0: I actually don't know if I ever saw the fourth one now that I think about it, but I've definitely seen the plot of the Taitoku G financial group in Cinderella Rhapsody, uh Disco check picked them all up and they're all just gonna be.

586
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:47,955
Speaker 0: you're gonna be able to watch him Mm-hmm.

587
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:52,600
Speaker 0: So if you have if you have not listened to geek nights for 12 years and don't know what the hell we're talking about.

588
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:58,180
Speaker 0: Go find project echo the first like OAV and just watch it.

589
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Speaker 0: It is like a big part of American anime fandom history, and it's pretty funny.

590
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:12,628
Speaker 0: So this is crazy, uh There's gonna be a new Irresponsible captain Tyler anime short series.

591
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:13,391
Speaker 1: This is crazy.

592
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,120
Speaker 1: This is like we just talked about there being a new antenna manga.

593
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:19,944
Speaker 1: I think that was dead and someone's gonna make a new thing Captain Tyler.

594
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:20,887
Speaker 1: was it the one?

595
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,556
Speaker 1: it was just a 26 episode anime series, right?

596
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:24,098
Speaker 0: Then it was.

597
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:25,263
Speaker 0: there was a. no That was it.

598
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:25,685
Speaker 0: Nope.

599
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:26,086
Speaker 0: There was no.

600
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,593
Speaker 0: AV came out later.

601
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:32,370
Speaker 0: All right, there was a movie, too Yeah, but the movie is sort of like the capstone to the OAV.

602
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,394
Speaker 1: But anyway, but it's still.

603
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:37,658
Speaker 1: it's like this thing is bigger than I thought it was.

604
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,563
Speaker 0: So here's the thing.

605
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,850
Speaker 1: but it hasn't been around in years.

606
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,220
Speaker 1: hasn't been a single thing related to this property made in forever?

607
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:46,222
Speaker 0: Yeah Like no one.

608
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,730
Speaker 0: like most people in America have never even heard of this.

609
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:53,806
Speaker 0: but to this day like irresponsible captain Tyler is One of my favorite anime ever.

610
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:58,360
Speaker 0: like it is in my personal top 10 list and I feel like it is an a anime.

611
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,345
Speaker 0: It is legit.

612
00:40:59,406 --> 00:40:59,989
Speaker 0: It is good.

613
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:00,894
Speaker 0: It is funny.

614
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:02,000
Speaker 0: It is serious.

615
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:04,467
Speaker 0: I've never seen anything else quite like it.

616
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:11,672
Speaker 0: And if you've seen even one episode of legend of the Galactic Heroes, it's even better but You should watch it.

617
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:22,138
Speaker 0: But much like cowboy bebop much like utenna It is a thing that what came out originally was perfect and ended like it finished itself.

618
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:22,720
Speaker 0: It was done.

619
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,725
Speaker 0: It told its story.

620
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:35,155
Speaker 0: So it is shocking to me that Oh, yeah The series is the first television anime adaptation of the 24 year in the 24 years since the 1993 Irresponsible captain.

621
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:38,965
Speaker 1: that's how old it is 93 24 years.

622
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:41,393
Speaker 1: I thought it was later than I thought it was like 97 98 or something.

623
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:48,835
Speaker 0: I in 1993 like well, I think probably in 94 or 95 is when I actually got it.

624
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:50,200
Speaker 1: That's what I was in like middle school.

625
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:55,040
Speaker 0: Yeah I watched a fan sub of some irresponsible captain Tyler Cuz.

626
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:56,346
Speaker 0: then I got through.

627
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:59,740
Speaker 1: I didn't know I never heard of it until college and we saw it at the anime club.

628
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a second meeting maybe or something like that.

629
00:42:03,193 --> 00:42:04,900
Speaker 0: I was like advocating constantly.

630
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,851
Speaker 0: I was like guys you got a show captain Tyler captain Tyler captain Tyler cuz.

631
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:11,359
Speaker 0: I was obsessed with it and I could never get until RIT anime.

632
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:18,660
Speaker 0: I never saw more than like the first five or six episodes and then like one or two random episodes near the end.

633
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,533
Speaker 0: I literally like had no idea like how it ended.

634
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:22,021
Speaker 1: I don't think I saw the whole thing I saw.

635
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:28,774
Speaker 1: I watched a whole bunch of episodes and then stopped before the end and then I don't know how far before the end And then didn't ever watch it again.

636
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,164
Speaker 0: Oh shit The end is so.

637
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:40,440
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that the like what it does in the end is as good as cowboy bebop But it is real fucking close It's real.

638
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:47,740
Speaker 0: There is this moment where a character salutes a character and you'll just like the tears just gonna stream down from the one eye.

639
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,935
Speaker 1: But anyway, there is no more star lock.

640
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:51,337
Speaker 1: show up.

641
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,999
Speaker 0: Ah It's I can't I'm just not even you gotta see it.

642
00:42:56,762 --> 00:43:14,848
Speaker 0: This is set I guess in the far future after the world of the original captain Tyler and the main character is Banjo wacky Tyler who probably is a great descendant of Justy Ricky Tyler the original captain Tyler.

643
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,714
Speaker 0: I guess he carries a banjo around.

644
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:23,746
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and I Don't know if this looks like it's gonna be good Makes it look scary.

645
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:28,820
Speaker 0: It draws heavily from the original source material, which I actually didn't know shit about.

646
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,291
Speaker 1: I know what's the original source material?

647
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,560
Speaker 1: the anime bad?

648
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,067
Speaker 1: What it wait what came before the anime?

649
00:43:34,308 --> 00:43:39,126
Speaker 0: apparently it was a series of light novels, of course I'm gonna quote this con that.

650
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:47,650
Speaker 0: so basically because it's being re-released and a Twitter was in the boat with me They were like wow That is some in like who is bringing this back?

651
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:50,019
Speaker 0: and they all learned about captain Tyler all at once.

652
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:56,718
Speaker 0: Quote all this Tyler talk led me to look up the original novels and wow, there were some cream lemon shit.

653
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:12,136
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm apparently, uh captain Tyler in the manga or in the original novels is way older than the one in the anime and the girl oselin is Way younger than the girl in the anime alien girl.

654
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:18,735
Speaker 1: Yeah bad news Like the alien Queen princess, whatever she is, she's the princess.

655
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:19,860
Speaker 0: there's the all like Queen.

656
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,107
Speaker 0: I could use the Queen that it's complicated.

657
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:23,150
Speaker 1: her dad is the bad guy.

658
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:24,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I read it.

659
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:36,260
Speaker 0: So, uh Yeah, this is all bikini armor Heba file nonsense probably and the fact that this draws from the source material really worries me.

660
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:53,619
Speaker 0: So until I say otherwise because I think I am like the biggest fan of captain Tyler Do not watch the new show Go watch the original TV show and nothing else and I will find out if the new show is creepy porn or bad or maybe good, but I'm

661
00:44:54,947 --> 00:44:55,753
Speaker 1: in the movie also, uh

662
00:44:56,961 --> 00:45:01,560
Speaker 0: So the OAV is like a bunch of short stories that don't really add much to the universe.

663
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:07,154
Speaker 0: The the the original TV show is literally all you need to see everything else.

664
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:09,220
Speaker 0: It'd be like remember the cowboy bebop movie.

665
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:21,323
Speaker 0: It's like that like here's some more stories, but we don't actually bring anything new into the world Which I guess is good because if the cowboy bebop movie added more to the world it kind of would have ruined what the show did

666
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:22,334
Speaker 1: whatever, uh

667
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,671
Speaker 0: So kimono friends, which we already talked about why

668
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:28,096
Speaker 1: is this even coming up again?

669
00:45:28,117 --> 00:45:30,685
Speaker 1: Holy shit It's a big deal right now, but who cares?

670
00:45:30,805 --> 00:45:42,399
Speaker 0: it is like it's getting so big in Japan that apparently the character song alga album Which I love the Japan even today the IST.

671
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:48,380
Speaker 1: This is one of the things that fascinated me about Japan and I guess also has to do with the business model for anime.

672
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,102
Speaker 1: They're right here.

673
00:45:49,504 --> 00:45:54,520
Speaker 1: The anime itself is the product whereas in Japan anime is just an advertisement for stuff.

674
00:45:54,831 --> 00:46:03,100
Speaker 1: Yeah But the sheer amount and wide variation of stuff that they make for every single property is like mind-boggling.

675
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:05,068
Speaker 1: I did not learn back in the day.

676
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:10,270
Speaker 1: They would make so many crazy things And like these things take a lot of effort to make.

677
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:18,018
Speaker 1: but like you can go back and it's like Oh Sailor Moon like character album and it's like oh, please save my earth.

678
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:25,520
Speaker 0: the Second is T. That is all original music that was not in the anime coupled with an audio drama with the original voice.

679
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:31,876
Speaker 1: There's like Trigon audio drama album and it's like who put that much work into making this.

680
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:35,700
Speaker 1: Yeah obscure Minuscule audience thing.

681
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:39,151
Speaker 0: I got a fan sub of the fucking please save my earth.

682
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:42,140
Speaker 0: audio drama and like read through it while I listen to it.

683
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,810
Speaker 1: Right, so it's like for some small intellectual property.

684
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,220
Speaker 1: mikamoto friends is bigger than those but it's like they'll makes this thing.

685
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:50,915
Speaker 1: that's like how many is this gonna sell?

686
00:46:50,956 --> 00:46:56,079
Speaker 1: like No, there's a handful of people on earth who want this and a lot of people worked hard to make it.

687
00:46:56,361 --> 00:47:00,601
Speaker 0: I learned about that aspect of the industry in high school because I was really into Sailor Moon Like.

688
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:08,928
Speaker 0: I got all the fan subs like watched it all and I found the figurines of extremely obscure Side character who appears in one scene.

689
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:13,310
Speaker 0: I found the soundtrack like and it was like this Well, I want to say it was like a 12 CD box.

690
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:18,474
Speaker 0: So I pirated that shit and it took me a while to pirate it.

691
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:19,478
Speaker 0: cuz that back then like 12 CDs.

692
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:21,794
Speaker 0: yeah, that was a big deal.

693
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:32,231
Speaker 0: and most of those songs were never in the show and Some of them were OSTs and which I figured out was like, you know original soundtrack and some of them were ISTs.

694
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:37,868
Speaker 0: and I started learning about all this music that gets made that is never featured in shows.

695
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:39,293
Speaker 0: and then Eska flown ahead.

696
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,095
Speaker 0: the same thing.

697
00:47:40,115 --> 00:47:54,930
Speaker 0: and there's this whole weird world the kimono friends, I guess IST Was apparently ranked number one and Its OST was ranked number two on the weekly album chart this month.

698
00:47:56,323 --> 00:48:01,890
Speaker 0: so Holy shit is kimono friends like the exploding nonsense in Japan?

699
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:05,550
Speaker 1: It means more people bought this than bought any other music.

700
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:12,170
Speaker 1: They bought an album of kimono friends music that was not in kimono friends ever and an album of music that was in it.

701
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,349
Speaker 0: Cuz they're two different albums.

702
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:29,937
Speaker 0: See this this is this is the difference between someone who watches anime versus someone who watches anime and then like looks at the Internet You see this nonsense going on and someone an anime fan in Japan who buys character albums Fan in the u.s.

703
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:31,869
Speaker 1: Who watches on crunchyroll and that's it.

704
00:48:32,191 --> 00:48:38,622
Speaker 0: I want to know like are there people who buy these albums that don't watch the anime like How deep does the rabbit hole go?

705
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:40,049
Speaker 0: and I just don't know I know.

706
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:44,263
Speaker 0: So last and least, uh, oh, yeah the watermelon thing.

707
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:46,010
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about I think we're out of time.

708
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,010
Speaker 0: Actually, we've done like a full show and the last thing I got here is the Japanese video game rankings.

709
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,119
Speaker 0: Cuz that was my backup in case we went too quick.

710
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:59,798
