1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,963
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 18th 2023.

2
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:11,405
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:14,056
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights night.

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:17,932
Speaker 1: We're talking about lore In video games not data's nemesis.

5
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:19,680
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:25,160
Speaker 1: And y'all are playing Marvel snap way more than I play Marvel snap and I play it.

7
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,720
Speaker 0: Listen, I only play in the morning.

8
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:38,540
Speaker 0: I wake up and I do my morning biz and then I get to the computer and before I do my the Java paid to I play Marvel snap until the daily missions are complete.

9
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:48,770
Speaker 1: I play my first Marvel snap until the first bowel movement I have given day and that is when I play Marvel snap until I'm done Boweling and then I play again like over lunch.

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:55,812
Speaker 0: Sometimes I'm not reading I complete all the daily missions And then I just don't play again at all period until the next.

11
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:58,280
Speaker 1: I see I don't you complete the missions.

12
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:07,112
Speaker 1: I ignore the missions and just play and every night I just go and click on all the missions I accidentally got because I happen to achieve whatever they're asking for.

13
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,395
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I don't like.

14
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:11,871
Speaker 0: the only time it's like I'm not I don't have to try to do with.

15
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:20,320
Speaker 0: the missions are asking for 90 Play 500 power with the cards like yeah, I just play until they're all complete by happenstance.

16
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,378
Speaker 0: But there might be an annoying one.

17
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:28,500
Speaker 0: That's like it is, you know It's a really weird one and I might have to like play a different deck for two seconds.

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,571
Speaker 0: Like if it's like play ten ongoing cards like alright I'll make a deck of all ongoing cards and clear that right.

19
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:37,516
Speaker 0: just cuz I have I only have one ongoing card in my deck Right, so it's like, you know.

20
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:52,040
Speaker 0: But and the other thing is like sometimes if they're you know If the when the seasons coming to an end if I if there's some season missions You might have to take a look and make sure that you got them all right, which usually you've got them all right.

21
00:01:52,222 --> 00:02:09,120
Speaker 0: It's just gonna happen not naturally You don't have to think about it but just in case you got a check and then You know in the past the previous season They changed the rules to where when you hit a tenth rank like you hit rank 50 you get five ranks free.

22
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,423
Speaker 0: So you just teleport from 50 to 55 you get to 60 to teleport you to 65.

23
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:26,500
Speaker 0: So what I did is because of that new rule I you know I put in like one extra hour just like right to get up to 70 right because it's 70 you get a big credit reward.

24
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:30,251
Speaker 1: Well, I do not think about it that hard I just play.

25
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:39,423
Speaker 1: but if I'm it right if I'm at any nine I usually will just push a little more cuz usually just a few a few games and you'll automatically get enough cubes to go Up to the next rank.

26
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:47,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then at 80 you don't really get anything worthwhile And at 90 you get a bunch of gold and it's like I could push for 90.

27
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:49,480
Speaker 0: The problem is I don't have the cards to make a meta day.

28
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:50,022
Speaker 1: I only.

29
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:53,716
Speaker 1: I only just got Dracula and Dracula ain't even in my meta anymore.

30
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,660
Speaker 1: I can't even use them now.

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,364
Speaker 1: I got him too late.

32
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:56,853
Speaker 0: You should just play that.

33
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,040
Speaker 0: I've been playing the deck.

34
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,184
Speaker 1: I'm playing that.

35
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:02,173
Speaker 1: turn him that deck that the tournament deck that I just copied.

36
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,140
Speaker 1: That's the like hella discard deck.

37
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,400
Speaker 0: Oh, can't you copy a tournament decker because I already was playing discard.

38
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:10,233
Speaker 1: So now I have two different discard decks and I'm sort of.

39
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:11,880
Speaker 0: I just played the Dracula kind.

40
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,018
Speaker 0: I don't like the the hella K.

41
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:17,215
Speaker 1: I liked the Dracula more modok kind and it won a lot.

42
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:23,860
Speaker 1: but this other tournament deck It wins a lot more and it's usually big eight pew victories.

43
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,591
Speaker 0: But I'm also missing some cards.

44
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,478
Speaker 1: I happen to have all the cards.

45
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:31,185
Speaker 0: for that one It's like it's weird.

46
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,853
Speaker 0: It's like every single top meta deck.

47
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:46,280
Speaker 1: I'm missing like a couple cards Yeah, or it's like well, I find funny is every what time anyone in our discord complains about not having a card I have always had that card, but I'm missing a bunch of cards that most of you have and don't even use.

48
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:54,374
Speaker 0: It's like this is you know, if they made it, you know It's just someone make a card game where people can have every card, right?

49
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:55,158
Speaker 0: Well, we had that.

50
00:03:55,298 --> 00:04:01,480
Speaker 1: it was called Let me trade even though I know letting trading happen would just bring even more capital as they're not gonna let trading.

51
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,405
Speaker 0: It's not gonna happen.

52
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:07,260
Speaker 0: They wouldn't mind though if they let you trade variants only right?

53
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,626
Speaker 0: It's like I could trade.

54
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,140
Speaker 0: it's like you can't you know, it's like I'll trade you all my pixels.

55
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,790
Speaker 0: I don't want any of these right?

56
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,040
Speaker 0: you give me those nice ones that I actually want.

57
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:43,635
Speaker 1: So one funny thing and I know I'm gonna come right in and in before you and say that I know this is just a statistical anomaly that is very likely like it is common and expected but it felt like whenever I play blade, which sometimes I'll play like I got him round one and even if the odds are Astronomically low like one in six or one in seven that hell is gonna be one.

58
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:45,180
Speaker 0: It's not astronomically low.

59
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:46,137
Speaker 0: That's just pretty good.

60
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:47,846
Speaker 1: so but it felt like it happened a lot.

61
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:51,820
Speaker 1: so I started keeping track of one metric for the last week and that metric us.

62
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:58,707
Speaker 1: If I have hella in my hand and I put played blade one how many other cards were in my hand?

63
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,649
Speaker 1: and two was hella discarded out of 44 times.

64
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,905
Speaker 1: that has occurred in about two weeks 100% of the time.

65
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,830
Speaker 1: I am not exaggerating or joking.

66
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:13,299
Speaker 1: Hella was the card discarded no matter how many cards are in my hand.

67
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:19,828
Speaker 1: So you you threw down 44 blades 44 blades over two and a half weeks where hella was.

68
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:24,300
Speaker 1: how many you eliminated cases where hella has to already be in my hand.

69
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:33,600
Speaker 1: I don't count it if there's other shenanigans Like if I play blade on Something where blades gonna go off multiple times like it has to hit on the first time or it doesn't count like I thought about.

70
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:36,020
Speaker 0: So basically you see didn't record.

71
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:42,040
Speaker 0: So the thing is really statistically speaking you should be including the cases where you played blade and hella wasn't in the hand.

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:50,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even though you're counting cases where hella was in the hand there were at least one non Hella card in the hand other than

73
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:55,987
Speaker 1: well with the other caveat that I have never played blade where there's only two other cards In my hand and one of them's hella like.

74
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,013
Speaker 1: that's just stupid right?

75
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,139
Speaker 0: That's a stupid play, right?

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:06,260
Speaker 1: I will try a one in three if I if I'm feeling lucky and it actually works out Normally with other cards, but not with blade.

77
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:12,006
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna keep track of this until the first time hella is until blade does not discard hella.

78
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:16,665
Speaker 1: It's just funny that that I did.

79
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 1: I noticed it and so far based on the data I have collected it is true blade.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,320
Speaker 0: Hey, I mean, you know, you might just if you're unlucky you're unlucky.

81
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:33,885
Speaker 0: But the point is that I'll say in the deck the discard deck I have yeah, is that I only play Colleen sif and modok.

82
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:36,795
Speaker 0: I don't have to have no luck doesn't enter into it.

83
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:42,020
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my other deck That I think my other discard deck is almost identical to your discard.

84
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't I don't play around with luck that way.

85
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,435
Speaker 0: You don't you don't get burnt.

86
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:49,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Consistency is king for winning card games.

87
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:51,669
Speaker 1: It is like 70 80 percent.

88
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,191
Speaker 0: right now with this day if your win rate is 70 80 percent That's higher than any meta deck ever.

89
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:57,076
Speaker 0: So I don't I don't play.

90
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:01,512
Speaker 1: I'm down in the 40s because I don't play so I don't have.

91
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:02,857
Speaker 0: your win rate is 70 80 percent.

92
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:09,505
Speaker 1: It's like how are you down in the 40s cuz I play 10 games over the course of a couple days Like I don't play.

93
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:10,351
Speaker 0: that I did you then.

94
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,097
Speaker 0: how did you have 40 times?

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,433
Speaker 0: That with blade hella plays right right now.

96
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:17,798
Speaker 1: I'm playing more often.

97
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,035
Speaker 1: I don't know my win rate is right now, but I want to.

98
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:21,840
Speaker 1: I tend to win.

99
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,590
Speaker 0: You're playing only on the pooper.

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,525
Speaker 0: It's like You're not using a tracker.

101
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:29,889
Speaker 0: So how do you even know what your win rate is?

102
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,180
Speaker 1: that because I started writing down these fucking blade games.

103
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,228
Speaker 0: You got paper in the in the shed.

104
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,600
Speaker 1: I got paper that I can't my little my moleskine.

105
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,808
Speaker 1: That's what I'm using it for right now.

106
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:43,760
Speaker 1: the hella blade situation Anyway.

107
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:49,200
Speaker 1: So in the news, of course NHL Stanley Cup's happening first important games tonight.

108
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,968
Speaker 1: So that's why I kind of rushed through the show.

109
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:51,952
Speaker 0: playoffs are happening.

110
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,924
Speaker 0: The Stanley Cup is an object It can't have a Stanley Cup.

111
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:58,897
Speaker 1: playoffs are happening and we're in round one right now.

112
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,105
Speaker 0: and so far The exciting you know.

113
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:05,080
Speaker 0: yesterday the to add to East games which you know, we're in we're okay.

114
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:21,590
Speaker 0: And then they had two exciting West games, but of course It's like no one's up for that shit like there's no one on the East Coast is So in the news, you know when there's a Company like they would ruin the internet day.

115
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:28,340
Speaker 1: April Fool's Day has often been the day where a lot of companies would announce something That they think is a joke and they intend to be seen as a joke.

116
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:34,337
Speaker 1: But the thing they announced as a joke is better than the things they actually announced and people actually want the joke.

117
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:41,876
Speaker 0: internet date This year fell on a weekend, which I think and also fatigue I think contributed to it being less of a thing, which I was very happy about.

118
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:56,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but One of the things that happened actually the day before that day But most people didn't notice it until that day was Sega announced a visual novel murder mystery where Sonic the Hedgehog is dead And I think that was an on-purpose April Fool.

119
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,503
Speaker 1: It was so.

120
00:08:57,543 --> 00:09:05,172
Speaker 1: people thought it acted like it was a joke at first and then it appeared on Steam And you can actually play it and it was really.

121
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,860
Speaker 0: I downloaded it and played it for five minutes.

122
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did not download it yet, but I will.

123
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:11,579
Speaker 1: I'm just glad that it was a real thing and not a joke.

124
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:12,922
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

125
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:18,480
Speaker 0: hey, you know a lot of people have made the April Fool's Day joke, but also real thing, right?

126
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:24,840
Speaker 1: Yep, which I think is the pro ist way to handle the current form of ruin the internet day, right?

127
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:32,340
Speaker 0: It's like we will make a silly novelty product or at least imitation facsimile replacement thereof.

128
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:35,260
Speaker 0: Right, like how many times is like, you know?

129
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,900
Speaker 0: Some cards against humanity must have done this like a few times right where they're like.

130
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,594
Speaker 0: Hey, we printed some silly cards on April Fool's Day.

131
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:43,519
Speaker 0: buy them, right?

132
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:48,942
Speaker 1: Yeah They definitely were the ones who would push that kind of thing the most I Don't know.

133
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,805
Speaker 0: I don't remember specifically if they did that.

134
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:52,789
Speaker 0: It just feels like that's something that they would do.

135
00:09:52,969 --> 00:10:04,951
Speaker 1: Yeah in Some other news that is a little more interesting or at least we talk about this every year as GDQ is coming up real quick It's earlier than usually.

136
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,559
Speaker 0: usually it's like 4th of July weekend.

137
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,236
Speaker 1: now It's May 28th through June 4th.

138
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,020
Speaker 0: So like I think the reason for this is because of their change of location, right?

139
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:24,539
Speaker 0: Their previous GDQ the regular one that was in, you know around January was going to be an in-person one But it was in a bad state a literally Florida bad place.

140
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:33,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, what has gone pretty fast to the point that I would not go there, especially not going to Florida Yeah, so they were like fuck you, Florida We're not having our event there and they held an online one.

141
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,455
Speaker 0: even they didn't want to.

142
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:37,266
Speaker 0: they wanted in-person one again And then they're like fine.

143
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:39,334
Speaker 0: So now they moved to a different state.

144
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:40,258
Speaker 0: What state did they move to?

145
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaker 0: Is it Minnesota?

146
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,334
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

147
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:45,805
Speaker 1: I Realize it's not actually on.

148
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,479
Speaker 1: I'm on the actual official page and it's not like obvious where it is.

149
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:53,373
Speaker 0: I haven't clicked event info attendance guide and hotel booking.

150
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:56,225
Speaker 0: it is in Minneapolis, Minnesota so it's it.

151
00:10:56,245 --> 00:11:04,540
Speaker 0: yeah, it's in Minnesota, which is for some reason a Place that a lot of gaming things tend to have a big in the Midwest.

152
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,588
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's just Minnesota.

153
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:11,887
Speaker 0: specifically like location wise it's in the middle So the people from both sides can get to it.

154
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:13,492
Speaker 0: It's sort of fair, right?

155
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,800
Speaker 0: It's a city, right?

156
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:27,603
Speaker 0: it's not just like, you know, even though Minnesota the state has a lot of Unpopulated areas or sparsely populated areas, you know Minneapolis is.

157
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:38,100
Speaker 1: there is a history to just in general of the American Midwest much like North Jersey just having a huge number of small gaming conventions and events relative to like other states.

158
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:44,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but anyway, that's they got a new location and a state that they find acceptable.

159
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the registration is open.

160
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,927
Speaker 0: They've already published the fee in person.

161
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:55,860
Speaker 0: The them getting that new deal with the new location is why the dates were moved.

162
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,503
Speaker 1: I think so.

163
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:58,531
Speaker 1: So I bet starting next year.

164
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,640
Speaker 1: It'll move back to our traditional dates.

165
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:05,172
Speaker 0: Maybe something in this location that they've got the hill in Minneapolis.

166
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:10,996
Speaker 0: Maybe someone's got like 4th of July booked there for years Or maybe this will just be a better time.

167
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:19,332
Speaker 1: Like I don't know I feel like honestly when GDQ is during actual summer I tend to watch most of it way later because I'm outside.

168
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,762
Speaker 1: I don't really want to be sitting watching something but it Yep.

169
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,048
Speaker 1: Yeah this springtime.

170
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,780
Speaker 1: There's more likelihood of bad or at least not perfect weather.

171
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,267
Speaker 1: So I'm more likely to watch something live.

172
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:32,278
Speaker 1: So we'll see Two good ones in the list.

173
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,244
Speaker 1: I I'm curious about that.

174
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:38,676
Speaker 1: There's always a maniac mansion or like an adventure game kind of thing.

175
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:39,780
Speaker 1: They're doing loom again.

176
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,056
Speaker 1: I see some x-men arcade at the end.

177
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, x-men arcade how it's like, how could you go faster in that?

178
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:46,820
Speaker 0: It's sort of like.

179
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,266
Speaker 0: Well, it says win the.

180
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:57,479
Speaker 1: so Metroid master is doing a two-player co-op one CC attempt One player one CC attempt.

181
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,300
Speaker 1: Okay They're special.

182
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,148
Speaker 0: Basically, if they die that doesn't count.

183
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:10,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, I assume if you play that game as long as you don't die it's like the time it takes is gonna be pretty much the same.

184
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,685
Speaker 0: because like You know, it's like.

185
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:16,280
Speaker 0: how much faster can you kill the bad guys, right?

186
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,004
Speaker 0: It's like they.

187
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:18,773
Speaker 0: there's only so many attacks you have.

188
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:19,940
Speaker 0: you have so many mutant powers.

189
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,700
Speaker 0: I guess there's a little bit of strategy of like what screen has a lot of bad guys.

190
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,855
Speaker 0: So therefore using the mutant power can speed the game up by getting through.

191
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,779
Speaker 0: that's not like gauntlet.

192
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:31,840
Speaker 1: We're like there's secrets and paths and things you can follow.

193
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like but it's pretty much of.

194
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:40,416
Speaker 0: it's like a really narrow window of time variance As long as you don't die on how long it will take to be like.

195
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:46,260
Speaker 1: the same Issue applies to final fight where there are two final fight three speed runs.

196
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,037
Speaker 1: Yeah Hey got any news.

197
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:58,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the people who made Pokemon go and What was the first one that didn't have a have a license?

198
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:00,040
Speaker 0: Oh ingress ingress?

199
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:02,625
Speaker 1: We've done panels about.

200
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:05,174
Speaker 1: I uploaded some YouTube shorts and then what those?

201
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:06,720
Speaker 0: a Harry Potter when they shut down, right?

202
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I think there was some other ones but they basically just keep making.

203
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,388
Speaker 0: had that one game ingress And then they managed to.

204
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,020
Speaker 0: it was it was had problems.

205
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,253
Speaker 0: We've talked about it extensively more than it deserves to be talked about.

206
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:23,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they've effectively Rebranded that same game with different intellectual properties to make it successful.

207
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:24,554
Speaker 0: and it's all.

208
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,680
Speaker 0: but it's only worked once really with Pokemon go.

209
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:32,700
Speaker 0: And now they're trying again This time with monster hunter and the cooperation of Capcom.

210
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:43,010
Speaker 0: And they've added this time based on what the previews say they've added a little bit more Real quote real game to it.

211
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,140
Speaker 0: We're like you have to swipe to fight.

212
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:54,891
Speaker 0: Actually fight the monsters right sort of like a little Simon Says kind of deal like what you gotta throw the little pokeball like Technically you could throw it wrong.

213
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:57,080
Speaker 0: I guess no, but this is a little bit more than that.

214
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,285
Speaker 0: This is like off the month.

215
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:01,679
Speaker 0: You could like theoretically lose to a monster if you were just awful at it.

216
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:10,960
Speaker 0: I also read that they're gonna have things like you can go paintball Monsters and then just do all the fighting when you get home so you can go out and do your location.

217
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:11,765
Speaker 0: You have to set.

218
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,800
Speaker 0: well, you know if you're going out to do location stuff You don't have to like stand in each location and do comment.

219
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:25,580
Speaker 1: I bet I know why they're doing that because one of the things I see people who are weirdly into Pokemon go still complain about Is that they live in places where you can't walk around so they drive everywhere.

220
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,600
Speaker 1: So they'd rather just drive past places and that instead of stopping in their cars at places to Pokemon go and then continuing.

221
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:45,463
Speaker 0: yeah, but anyway, but I Guess if you're a monster hunter person and I think there is a quite an overlap between monster hunter people and Pokemon people At least I know several people who are into both things I People.

222
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,830
Speaker 1: I know I can't imagine them playing both of those games.

223
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:50,680
Speaker 0: So I know some people who play both of those games.

224
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,229
Speaker 0: But yeah, I know I mean both played both of the other.

225
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,179
Speaker 1: the antic walk around and do basically the same thing games.

226
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,228
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing right is?

227
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:01,060
Speaker 0: I guess if you're a person who loves both of these games.

228
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:07,264
Speaker 0: right, it's like Could you end up like Going at doing?

229
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,953
Speaker 0: you're walking around and like you hope you go to a location.

230
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,220
Speaker 0: open up Pokemon go play play play play play Play.

231
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,974
Speaker 0: open up the monster hunter play play play play play.

232
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,240
Speaker 0: then change locations.

233
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:21,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's possible especially if there's like raid locations and I feel like it's gonna have that kind of stuff.

234
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,530
Speaker 0: yeah, I wonder if people are gonna gonna do that.

235
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,485
Speaker 0: and or I wonder if this one will Peter out the way the Harry Potter one day.

236
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:32,140
Speaker 1: I'm gonna guess this one will Peter out similar to the Harry Potter one.

237
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,143
Speaker 1: My guess is Pokemon.

238
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:39,270
Speaker 1: intellectual property is the sole driver of continued interest in Pokemon go.

239
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:44,977
Speaker 0: But this this monster hunter has a lot in common with Pokemon that Harry Potter doesn't.

240
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:45,860
Speaker 1: it does.

241
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:53,429
Speaker 0: But it doesn't have any of monsters and I don't think it has as much Redding all sorts of different monster bits to craft things.

242
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:01,097
Speaker 0: It doesn't have as much reach in North America As a much bigger reach than you realize monster hunter is.

243
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:01,860
Speaker 1: I know it's huge.

244
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,608
Speaker 1: I don't think it has the reach of folks not fortnight huge.

245
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,417
Speaker 0: It's not Pokemon huge, but I think it's actually.

246
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:08,020
Speaker 0: you know what it is.

247
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:14,760
Speaker 0: it's like Pokemon is big because you're taking into account, you know, the anime and the merchandise and the move.

248
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,420
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, there's a whole system feeding that that core intellectual property, right?

249
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:27,508
Speaker 0: I think if you compared only the Pokemon video game in North America to only Monster hunter video game in North America.

250
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:30,819
Speaker 0: I think the numbers there are probably closer than you realize.

251
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,040
Speaker 1: and no I'm not disagreeing with that at all.

252
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:39,800
Speaker 1: I just think the copy the overlap in terms of someone who will want to play a walk-around nothing Yeah.

253
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:49,540
Speaker 0: So what I'm saying is that I think only the kind of person who's playing The video game the real video game is the kind of person who's gonna play the walk-around one.

254
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:57,620
Speaker 1: I think someone who plays monster hunter the video game But does not play Pokemon the video game will be likely less interested in this once they realize what it is.

255
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:06,254
Speaker 1: But I think Pokemon I've seen it that IP will get people to consume terrible terrible things.

256
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:10,800
Speaker 0: just Here's unaware of what's going on in the monster hunter.

257
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:14,940
Speaker 1: I just don't think it's big enough to stay in a game like this in North America.

258
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:15,845
Speaker 0: It's I think it's.

259
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,919
Speaker 0: I think it definitely could be big enough.

260
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:18,723
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

261
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:24,870
Speaker 1: I'll bet that this Peters out around the same time frame that Harry Potter was bigger than monster hunter as an IP and that died.

262
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,473
Speaker 0: But Harry Potter doesn't have a video game right.

263
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:32,160
Speaker 0: so audience and you know.

264
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,788
Speaker 0: And it doesn't have a collecting thing going on.

265
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,280
Speaker 0: right monster hunter is like very similar to Pokemon.

266
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:49,472
Speaker 1: So yep, we shall see but anyway Things of the day.

267
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:50,400
Speaker 1: so a little video.

268
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,406
Speaker 1: This is a train guy.

269
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:57,585
Speaker 1: He's got a. there's a complex model train set up and They've gone further.

270
00:18:57,605 --> 00:19:00,900
Speaker 1: There's a camera on one of the trains so you can go around.

271
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:02,257
Speaker 0: I've seen people do that before.

272
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,888
Speaker 1: yeah but the problem is there's a monster.

273
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:24,232
Speaker 1: if you want to take this train there is a cat and they videoed the various interactions between the cat who lives in the place where this train set is and The train trying to navigate its space and this was Surprisingly cute and actually really funny and wholesome.

274
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,899
Speaker 1: I it's a short video, and I recommend watching it.

275
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:31,614
Speaker 0: I mean you know model trains at least the real ones are pretty sturdy.

276
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:35,771
Speaker 0: a cat's not gonna break them as long as doesn't like Fall off the table, but it's funny cuz like one of them.

277
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,599
Speaker 0: They don't go fast enough to hurt the cat either.

278
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:53,000
Speaker 1: Get electrocuted on the rails It doesn't do anything just sits there but it like looks at it when it comes back around the cat's looking at it with malice of forethought and Suddenly a little cat paw just goes bop out of nowhere.

279
00:19:53,827 --> 00:20:00,617
Speaker 0: Yep Well, so I want you to imagine that there's a water main break which is bad news.

280
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:05,600
Speaker 0: right means everyone Can't drink water and has to wait, and you know it's it's not good.

281
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,089
Speaker 0: You got to fix that shit quickly right?

282
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,400
Speaker 1: I mean when they turn off the water at RIT They shut the campus down.

283
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:16,333
Speaker 0: Yeah And also right water mains have high pressure water right.

284
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:18,920
Speaker 0: cuz it's like think about the pressure coming out in your shower.

285
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:24,494
Speaker 0: Well the main water main That's serving the whole building the whole area has to have enough pressure for all that.

286
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:28,326
Speaker 0: if everyone turns on their shower at the same Time water has to come out right.

287
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,870
Speaker 0: so that's the amount of pressure.

288
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,938
Speaker 0: That's upstream in the water supply right.

289
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:38,560
Speaker 0: so What do you do if you have this high pressure water pipe and it breaks and you got to fix it?

290
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:38,943
Speaker 0: It's like.

291
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:44,100
Speaker 0: you know water is coming out of it like Flooding everybody.

292
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:58,357
Speaker 0: I guess you could try to find the valves on either end and like close one and then Right then sort of repair it like weld it shut maybe But you know that's not maybe not the best idea on the situation.

293
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,072
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways to handle that but anyway.

294
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:06,531
Speaker 0: It's like well if you're not gonna turn off the water How could you possibly seal it shut?

295
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:09,463
Speaker 0: it's not like you could weld while there's water going Right.

296
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:14,960
Speaker 0: it's not like you could take some sort of metal lid and like you know wrap it around.

297
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,346
Speaker 0: It's like it's just gonna blast.

298
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:19,100
Speaker 0: you know you no one no human is strong enough to like.

299
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:25,500
Speaker 0: You know maybe I guess they could invent some sort of machine that does it and the machine is stronger than the blasting water.

300
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:30,319
Speaker 0: But nope there is of course a much simpler way to do it.

301
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:34,517
Speaker 0: That is probably not interesting at all to anyone with plumbing knowledge.

302
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:41,240
Speaker 0: They'd be like yep That's how you do that, but for someone without plumbing knowledge This is not a repair that you would see every day.

303
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,173
Speaker 0: It's not a technique that you would know unless someone taught it to you.

304
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:56,319
Speaker 0: so seeing somebody Use this repair method that is simple, but yet ingenious is like oh That's how they do that and that's nice to see and you feel like you're learning when you want to see this.

305
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,284
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah in the meta moment really quickly of course no conventions for us for a while But stay tuned for what's coming up.

306
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:10,999
Speaker 1: video from an online panel of zinc icon is on YouTube already and Soon I should have some video from the panel.

307
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,429
Speaker 1: Scott And I just did at PAX East on competitive versus casual.

308
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:16,996
Speaker 1: so I actually had someone of all day.

309
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,716
Speaker 1: someone messaged me on LinkedIn Asking if there was video of that panel.

310
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:27,680
Speaker 0: Okay, so well someone else someone in the crowd videoed the panel and just uploaded their unedited video to you guys.

311
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,393
Speaker 1: So and hopefully this will be the last time we've had to record a panel at a con in masks Just because it it definitely muffles the audio.

312
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:39,973
Speaker 1: I've had to do some Significant audio engineering to get this out.

313
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,238
Speaker 1: the audio good, but it's good enough.

314
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:41,639
Speaker 1: It'll work.

315
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, the new microphones.

316
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:44,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're pretty good -.

317
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,720
Speaker 0: yeah, the website is progressing.

318
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:54,110
Speaker 0: It helps that we now know that those microphones have a touchscreen and we can adjust them And it also.

319
00:22:54,211 --> 00:23:04,605
Speaker 0: the book club book is The satanic versus by Salman Rushdie and I as of yesterday have read every satanic verse I got.

320
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:07,259
Speaker 1: I got a couple more weeks of verses and then I'll be good to go.

321
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:19,754
Speaker 0: I know there are zero verses from the lips of Satan that have not entered that have not been transcribed into English and then Inserted into my eyeballs and interpreted by my meat brain.

322
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:21,500
Speaker 1: So just so give a couple weeks.

323
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,344
Speaker 1: We'll do the show on it.

324
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:23,409
Speaker 1: If you haven't started reading it.

325
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:30,780
Speaker 1: It's not actually that long of a read Just roll with it, but it wasn't due with the library until for two more.

326
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,480
Speaker 0: I'm supposed to return it on Thursday and I finished it yesterday.

327
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:42,900
Speaker 0: so and I think the library was a great strategy for the book club because I was like Well, I have to finish this by X day, right so I can return it on time.

328
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:47,939
Speaker 0: I don't want to renew it renewing sucks Yeah, and then it's like well, it means I had to read this many pages per day.

329
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:51,910
Speaker 0: but sometimes You might read a little under because like a big chapter ends.

330
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:56,678
Speaker 0: and sometimes you read a little over because you can see it's like Three pages to the next chapter, right?

331
00:23:57,664 --> 00:24:05,680
Speaker 0: In the middle of something and then once the end is in sight It's like you're holding like a handful of pages in your right hand and it's like alright, I guess we're finishing this.

332
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:06,758
Speaker 0: It's like the end.

333
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:10,039
Speaker 1: I think the most important thing for any of you who haven't picked up this book club book.

334
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:14,459
Speaker 1: yet Is that if you did not know the geopolitical context of?

335
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:29,440
Speaker 1: The government of Iran and religious extremists trying to murder the man who wrote it You would never believe that a government and a religion Or at least an aspect of a religion was trying to murder anyone over what is just a perfectly straightforward book.

336
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,647
Speaker 1: Well,

337
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:47,277
Speaker 0: no, no No, if I I mean there was a particular chapter in there where if I knew that there were fundamentalists radical religious people on earth and I knew that that religion that was being talked about in that chapter was their chapter I Could see how it would make those fundamentalist people quite angry.

338
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:58,442
Speaker 1: true To get to the level Particular chapter, but to get to the level of global theological leaders and heads of government That's just.

339
00:24:58,603 --> 00:25:07,070
Speaker 0: that was just a. I mean if there was right a you know, we're close to it I guess but it's like We we to my knowledge.

340
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:24,840
Speaker 0: I don't see any like ultra right-wing Christian governments, right At least you know, I guess state we see states in the United States that they have those we just talked about, Florida Yeah, but we haven't seen countries right that you know, we would probably see the same thing.

341
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,804
Speaker 0: But also, you know note that it was only one going after people for like, you know LGBTQ books like.

342
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:42,039
Speaker 1: I guess also there are tons of books that cover similar or even more offensive to that group Content and this one was picked out for specific political reasons related to Iran.

343
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:44,507
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just it's really just to quit right?

344
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:56,205
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there there are tons and tons and tons of you know books movies whatever media artwork stories criticizing Everything that there is to criticize.

345
00:25:56,205 --> 00:26:01,680
Speaker 1: 88 was just a particularly unlucky year to be the one who wrote a book about this, right?

346
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,203
Speaker 0: It's like, you know It just so happens.

347
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:19,757
Speaker 0: the fundamentalist people only find out about and focus on certain ones for completely Circumstantial reasons and it happened to be Zalman Rushdie and this book and also that French guy with the comics And a few and a few others who I apologize.

348
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:20,420
Speaker 0: I don't know of you.

349
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:32,780
Speaker 1: Well, it's like with the whole South Park thing where they portrayed Muhammad a couple of times as just a superhero In the show and then later they couldn't portray it again after a backlash, but no one actually noticed the first time.

350
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,637
Speaker 1: hmm Anyway, anyway, let's just dive right into it because there's hockey coming.

351
00:26:40,738 --> 00:26:45,496
Speaker 1: so uh Lore in games is kind of an interesting topic because like.

352
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:51,200
Speaker 1: on one hand You've got a style of game that has existed for all of time the kind of game that's gone.

353
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,806
Speaker 1: I don't really like to play that much anymore.

354
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,916
Speaker 1: where there's a game an independent of that game.

355
00:26:55,957 --> 00:27:01,153
Speaker 1: There's basically Tooltips filled with just pages and pages of text.

356
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:05,429
Speaker 1: you can read if you care But they don't in any way impact the game.

357
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:15,148
Speaker 1: like you might even not know that that lore is in there like I don't know a Scrolls type game where you could find out the pages of text about a particular Name of a person in the game.

358
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,880
Speaker 0: the ones you think of are like the old scrolls, right?

359
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, where you can read you could go into a place in like this books in like every house and you can read the books.

360
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:25,960
Speaker 0: Right and the books are only a few pages each.

361
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:34,637
Speaker 1: But you know They're telling you information about the game world or setting.

362
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:39,440
Speaker 1: that Doesn't really matter in terms of the mechanics of the game you're playing.

363
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:45,200
Speaker 1: It's just kind of there and in fact if you missed it might not even know you missed anything.

364
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:49,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, you know this this it's not just video games, right?

365
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,697
Speaker 0: It's like there's role-playing games that come with lots and lots of text.

366
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:59,780
Speaker 0: There are Board games that have like stories before in the front of the instruction manual, right?

367
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:03,103
Speaker 1: What is this?

368
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:07,433
Speaker 1: while I'm moving cubes and discs around a map what's it about Germany?

369
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,696
Speaker 0: something right there.

370
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:10,240
Speaker 0: every war game has a fucking.

371
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:15,586
Speaker 0: You know all kinds of shit lore real often non-fictional lore You know.

372
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:23,446
Speaker 0: even in any s game It's like, you know Zelda 1 you open up the instruction manual has lore and you know and at the end There's this lore at the end.

373
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:25,457
Speaker 0: We're at this text before at the beginning of the game.

374
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,395
Speaker 1: in the other two You don't read the instruction book.

375
00:28:28,926 --> 00:28:29,579
Speaker 1: Is that Zelda?

376
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:30,701
Speaker 1: Answer.

377
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:31,564
Speaker 1: No, that's it.

378
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:32,346
Speaker 1: It's complicated.

379
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:33,570
Speaker 1: who was involved in that game.

380
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,256
Speaker 1: But yeah, there's just some princess asleep.

381
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:35,818
Speaker 1: What am I doing?

382
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:36,179
Speaker 1: Huh?

383
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:39,668
Speaker 1: Right or left?

384
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,080
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter, right.

385
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,542
Speaker 0: but you know people may have games and the games have looked and sometimes the lore is delivered as Cutscenes.

386
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:59,454
Speaker 0: right and for some reason when the lore is delivered in like a cutscene form or an unskippable form or Dialogue along the way right half-life 2 being the most indicated Style, right?

387
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:07,128
Speaker 0: Yeah people don't sort of view it as a separate thing because you just sort of Get it for free.

388
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:08,413
Speaker 0: right people tend to.

389
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:27,139
Speaker 0: when they people talk about lore they're usually talking about when the lore is delivered as In a separate or non integrated fashion such that only some of the people who go out of their way to Get that, you know additional Experience will get it and most people will not.

390
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:29,107
Speaker 0: We matter what kind of game it is.

391
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:39,409
Speaker 1: I'd also say there's an interesting phenomenon where there are definitely a large number of people who play games Primarily to seek out that lore specifically.

392
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:43,960
Speaker 0: almost more so there are people who play games and give no craps about lore.

393
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:46,013
Speaker 1: Overwatch is so much like that.

394
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:52,840
Speaker 1: Like I play a lot of overwatch Like it's my primary FPS right now and I gotta say I actually don't know what the fuck is up with most of the characters.

395
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,033
Speaker 1: I don't know what the story is.

396
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:56,280
Speaker 0: Even fortnight has lower.

397
00:29:56,481 --> 00:30:02,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, a fuck if I know what's going on in fortnight Scott's Kojo is always trying to explain like oh, yeah There's so-and-so attack so and so and why.

398
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:06,600
Speaker 1: that's why that statues there and I'm just like, uh, anyway, there's a sniper in that tree.

399
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:12,435
Speaker 0: It's like there's nothing wrong with being either kind of person, right?

400
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:16,862
Speaker 0: I just feel like When you make a game of any kind Right.

401
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:26,260
Speaker 0: It's like you're trying to cater to these two audiences and you sort of taken these two Almost separate products with separate audiences and sort of glued one to the other, right?

402
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,140
Speaker 0: It's like well, there's people who need scissors and there's people who need forks.

403
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:34,155
Speaker 0: so I took a scissor and glued it to a fork and now everyone buys my scissor fork.

404
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:45,939
Speaker 0: the four people just sort of Use the fork part and like there's a scissor hanging off there for no reason that they never cut anything with and this is Buy it and they cut everything with it and there's a fork hanging off that they never eat with.

405
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:50,695
Speaker 0: and It's like why didn't the fork person buy a fork and this is a person by a scissor.

406
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,640
Speaker 0: Why are you selling scissor forks?

407
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,280
Speaker 0: Right.

408
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,794
Speaker 0: It's like if you're going to combine the two things they should be integrated right?

409
00:30:57,115 --> 00:31:00,007
Speaker 0: Like I said half-life 2 Etc, etc.

410
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:07,680
Speaker 0: to where you know The people getting it are getting the full thing and they're not just sort of ignoring half of what the effort.

411
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,013
Speaker 1: There's a lot to parse here.

412
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:10,979
Speaker 1: there's a lot going on.

413
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,312
Speaker 1: So on one hand some of this is just the evolution of games.

414
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:14,880
Speaker 1: Like I think a lot of that old.

415
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:21,040
Speaker 1: There's four paragraphs of text in a tooltip if you click on an item in your inventory that you would never otherwise find.

416
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:25,599
Speaker 1: I think that just comes out of the tang to the limitations of how old games were made.

417
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,249
Speaker 1: Lotta old em, like a lot of old muds were.

418
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,980
Speaker 1: just look at stuff and there's walls of text everywhere.

419
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:35,160
Speaker 0: Well, I think some of that is okay because like you might be playing a game, right?

420
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:37,500
Speaker 0: And you might not be a lore person who's out there.

421
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:47,138
Speaker 0: You don't really wants to learn everything about the world But you might see an object in the game and be like I want to just I'm playing this game I just want to know more about that thing right there.

422
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,873
Speaker 0: You know, like I need more information about that one thing and then there you go.

423
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,980
Speaker 0: The information is there when you need it.

424
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, right But I guess when you need.

425
00:31:55,804 --> 00:32:07,867
Speaker 1: it is also an interesting attribute because some games that lore in No way intersects with playing beating or enjoying the game at all other than Exploring it for its own sake.

426
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:13,159
Speaker 1: like there's nothing you could learn from the lore that would impact you decisions You would make in other parts of the game.

427
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:14,662
Speaker 0: No But it might.

428
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:23,580
Speaker 0: you might be able to instead of feasting on all of the lore and becoming like an expert on you know The universe of whatever name it is, right?

429
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,560
Speaker 0: You might take in a little bit of lore here a little bit of lore there, right?

430
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,400
Speaker 0: Just to sort of you know pepper it in right?

431
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:46,460
Speaker 0: I think that a good example right and I think a game that has a really interesting take on lore is the Metroid Prime right where and the other Metroid Prime's where you'd go around the game and The game would want you to scan things to get lower, right?

432
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:54,640
Speaker 0: and so First of all You had some people who were just like completionist because the game would tell you how much of the lore you found and scanned.

433
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,400
Speaker 0: So whether you read the lore or not There was like this incentive.

434
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:04,800
Speaker 0: If you're a completionist, it's like find every hidden lore thing that could be scanned and scan them all.

435
00:33:04,822 --> 00:33:12,731
Speaker 1: Yeah Even if you never read the text and I think that kind of player much like the Korok seeds 50/50 if they read the lore or not Probably don't not.

436
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:21,999
Speaker 0: Yeah But at the same time that someone who really wants lore Right might read all the lore or at least find them all online or something and read them.

437
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:33,179
Speaker 0: But a Casual player right might just sort of scan the lore as they go around right mostly not reading it But in a particularly interesting room.

438
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:40,000
Speaker 0: Let's say they might see like some creature in a tank of liquid and they'll scan it and they'll be like.

439
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:41,979
Speaker 0: That's a unique and interesting thing.

440
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,264
Speaker 0: What's up with that?

441
00:33:43,344 --> 00:33:47,720
Speaker 0: and they read it and there's additional context there and that can you know in?

442
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:51,959
Speaker 0: Enhances the meaning and the storytelling of the area that they're in.

443
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:56,711
Speaker 0: Right, even though they only read like one out of 20 30 lures.

444
00:33:56,932 --> 00:34:00,100
Speaker 1: I would say that is well done and well designed.

445
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:07,300
Speaker 1: Consuming that kind of lore should lead to better heuristics in terms of interacting with the game.

446
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,400
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that's required but that is a sign of high to high level elegant design, right?

447
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:21,838
Speaker 0: it would certainly be a very good game design if you know the story of The things in the game actually impacted the play.

448
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:35,951
Speaker 0: It can make you just care more right even though it might not change your game decisions Just making you care more and increasing the you know emotional impact of the next boss fight.

449
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:40,766
Speaker 0: because you read the lower and Day or sex human revolution.

450
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:52,619
Speaker 1: There's a moment where some lore basically I found out that some character caused the death of an NPC I liked and I chose to kill a bunch of other fuckers that I otherwise wouldn't have killed once I found that out

451
00:34:53,302 --> 00:35:01,598
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like, you know, even if it didn't have a decision component, you know If that character was just the next boss fight no matter what and you were going to kill them no matter what?

452
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:05,764
Speaker 0: It's just knowing that information Right?

453
00:35:05,784 --> 00:35:10,935
Speaker 0: might you know make you care more about that next boss, you know Like residence because we're talking about residuals.

454
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:16,437
Speaker 1: the other day Resident Evil 4 knowing what's going on in the world kind of impacted how I interacted with the world.

455
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:19,430
Speaker 1: but like other resident evils Fuck if I know what's going on.

456
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:22,623
Speaker 1: I'm just playing the game and solving the puzzles Right.

457
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:25,400
Speaker 0: I mean, there's definitely Resident Evil definitely has a problem.

458
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,562
Speaker 0: I played a lot of them almost um You know.

459
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:33,160
Speaker 0: and it's like if you don't know the stories of like earlier ones like and you try to play like five.

460
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:41,636
Speaker 0: It's like there's huge, you know moments that are supposed to have an emotional impact in five But if you haven't played one, two, three four, it's like who the hell is this?

461
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:42,459
Speaker 0: And why do I care?

462
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like surprise.

463
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:45,557
Speaker 0: It was me all along.

464
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:49,570
Speaker 0: It's like Yeah, it's like.

465
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:50,539
Speaker 0: it's like what I don't.

466
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,966
Speaker 0: It's like it was me all along.

467
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:56,612
Speaker 0: it's like you're still alive.

468
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,920
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it's completely different.

469
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:04,691
Speaker 1: But there's also the evolution of lore dumps like as craft in that like the half-life thing.

470
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:15,900
Speaker 1: the when people first played half-life and half-life - The fact that you're like the game is just sort of you're learning the story While you play and like walking around like that style of lore dump was really novel.

471
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,280
Speaker 1: But now honestly when a game does that to me all I can think is oh, they're just doing the half-life thing.

472
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:29,420
Speaker 0: It's just a cutscene where I can walk around during yeah Mmm, so I think the biggest problem for me is that like, you know, I'm a person who reads fantasy novels, right?

473
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,523
Speaker 0: And sci-fi novels.

474
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:34,840
Speaker 0: It's not like I dislike lore and learning about fictional worlds, right?

475
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:45,057
Speaker 0: The problem is is that at least video games and to a larger extent other kinds of games When they deliver the lore in a non integrated way, right?

476
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,791
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know a wrong mood wrong time.

477
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:50,794
Speaker 0: deal where it's like.

478
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:56,700
Speaker 0: I'm right now playing, you know I'm not literally right now, but let's say that I'm right now playing an old-school, right?

479
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:06,520
Speaker 0: I'm playing an old-school because I'm in the mood to go explore and You know level up my dude and hit some monsters with a sword or yell at them and make them fall off a cliff.

480
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:07,208
Speaker 0: Right.

481
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:08,542
Speaker 0: It's like that's the mood I'm in.

482
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:12,619
Speaker 0: if I was in the mood to read some books, I would go get a fantasy novel and read it.

483
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,382
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

484
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:18,577
Speaker 0: So if I'm walking around slashing skeletons, and I there's a treasure chest.

485
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,909
Speaker 0: I'm like, ooh gold Yes swords.

486
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:25,733
Speaker 1: Yes magic spells You open that treasure chest and it's like here are four paragraphs of text, right.

487
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:28,486
Speaker 0: and then there's a book and it's like, okay there's one book.

488
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:34,223
Speaker 0: if it has like a Paragraph it's like I might you know, it might I might read it Especially.

489
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:38,769
Speaker 0: it might cuz you know, it might have like a secret on it like, you know Oh, there's treasure in this place.

490
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,560
Speaker 0: go find it or something like that, right?

491
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:48,243
Speaker 0: But if I go in it's like aha I beat the skeleton and I got a key and I open the open a door and there's like a library in there with a Bunch of books.

492
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,820
Speaker 0: It's like well, I'm not in a book reading mood right now.

493
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,583
Speaker 1: Well, it's funny.

494
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,671
Speaker 0: I believe I was in a book reading mood.

495
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,856
Speaker 0: I would never go.

496
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:56,418
Speaker 0: You know what?

497
00:37:56,438 --> 00:38:03,120
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read I'm gonna go load Skyrim go back to that library room Read all those books on the shelf that are in there.

498
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,401
Speaker 1: You know what?

499
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:06,329
Speaker 1: I blame actually like five pages of text each.

500
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,136
Speaker 1: early RPGs like JRPGs in particular.

501
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:14,466
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy was a big component here where the trope was.

502
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:31,013
Speaker 1: you'd find a library at some point like usually toward the like the middle of the game or like the second the end of the second third of the game and you could Walk around this room and like click on each shelf to quote read the book But because it was a Super Nintendo or even on it

503
00:38:31,073 --> 00:38:31,776
Speaker 0: and see yeah,

504
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:37,358
Speaker 1: it's like one sentence like Ashura did the whatever and that's why X is why you're like, that's

505
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:38,223
Speaker 0: fine That's like.

506
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:45,906
Speaker 1: it takes two seconds, but I feel like people game designers Especially people who might have played those games and are now making games Remember that feeling.

507
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:57,306
Speaker 1: but they use modern technology and they just think to themselves Man, what if when I clicked on that it gave me an actual fucking book to read and would be if you think that And it's like in principle like that's awesome.

508
00:38:57,346 --> 00:39:01,640
Speaker 0: But in reality, you know who how many people are in a reading mood, right?

509
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:10,836
Speaker 0: Well, they get to that book And actually experience it the more likely they open it up and say wow It's cool that this book has several pages of text and all these books are actually different.

510
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:14,043
Speaker 0: not reading them I do.

511
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:29,720
Speaker 0: I'll feel bad though for it because there is some talented writers out there who are writing all those lures for video games for for everything right and You know everyone even the people who care about lore are playing the video game part, right?

512
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,200
Speaker 0: You can't not play the game part, but only some of the people are reading the lore part.

513
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:45,020
Speaker 0: so it's like a bunch of people did all this work to write so much text and Or make cutscenes and all this other stuff and a lot of people who are playing some percentage are just skipping that.

514
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,067
Speaker 1: Well, look at overwatch.

515
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:46,571
Speaker 1: go further.

516
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:47,900
Speaker 1: It ain't even in the game.

517
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,940
Speaker 1: You want to learn that lower like the characters talk to each other in the game?

518
00:39:51,040 --> 00:40:00,940
Speaker 1: But honestly, I have no idea what the fuck they're talking about And the only way to know is to watch YouTube videos and read comics that are outside of the game entirely.

519
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,903
Speaker 1: They're not even in the game.

520
00:40:02,445 --> 00:40:06,760
Speaker 0: We played the moon breakers and there was like some audio drama in the top right corner.

521
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:08,119
Speaker 0: Did you listen to the audio drum?

522
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:12,680
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure out how to stop it from playing at first because that you know for 10 seconds.

523
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:22,840
Speaker 1: so it just kept playing while I was playing the game and I I feel bad because it sounded like there was some interesting stuff going on there.

524
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,961
Speaker 0: We put a lot of effort into it, but it's like my brain Miniatures.

525
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:31,596
Speaker 1: my brain started filtering it out after about a minute and a half and I remembered.

526
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:38,564
Speaker 1: I noticed unless wait a minute And I realized it had stopped playing and it was like 40 minutes long and I didn't remember One thing.

527
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:43,880
Speaker 1: I could not tell you anything about what that audio had explained for the previous half hour.

528
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,789
Speaker 1: And then there's games like like a lot of adventure games.

529
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:50,713
Speaker 1: do this or disco.

530
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:54,190
Speaker 1: Elysium is a really good example where Part of the game is like.

531
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:58,047
Speaker 1: the game is figure out the lore, you know This game is literally and there's other games like it.

532
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:03,504
Speaker 1: You don't know shit about the world as a player and you're not expected to Playing the game.

533
00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:06,513
Speaker 1: Your goal is to figure out what the fuck is going on.

534
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:24,672
Speaker 1: So the game mechanics are Learn lore use that lore to react to the world to learn more lore mmm, and that is very elegant, but that also does not lend itself to games that are not Adjacent to the adventure game genre without extreme play craft.

535
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:25,554
Speaker 0: Yep.

536
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:29,163
Speaker 0: So I mean, you know, I talked about What's it called?

537
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:38,838
Speaker 0: King of Dragon Pass has a very unique thing going on where you know, there's this sort of Common lore like things that like basically everyone knows about.

538
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:49,682
Speaker 0: you know the gods and the history of the world right and when you start the game up all that lore is like in there and you Can just read it right which takes a while It's like.

539
00:41:50,184 --> 00:42:00,660
Speaker 0: but it actually matters because some of this right when you go on a hero quest in the game Part of the hero quests are basically like sort of reading comprehension tests.

540
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,726
Speaker 0: I'm like, how much do you remember from that lore?

541
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:03,629
Speaker 0: you read you have to.

542
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:10,808
Speaker 0: there's multiple choice questions, you know answer them correctly You know, otherwise you might not succeed at the hero quest.

543
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:21,408
Speaker 0: but at the same time right doing things in the game reveals And or modifies the lore.

544
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:35,055
Speaker 0: so it's like you'll go to a page in the lore in the game about like a god Right, maybe like, you know the Thor equivalent and it's like, you know, there's the black text which is the text That's always there every time right and then based on if something happened in the game.

545
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:57,170
Speaker 0: There might be like Edits that come into play right because it's like, you know like some added blue sentences or some things crossed out or changed because you played and things happened and Maybe you learned differently or your people believe differently or you know You discovered an artifact and then it's that right.

546
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,217
Speaker 0: and it's like the history right.

547
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:08,191
Speaker 0: it changes It might be changing to be more correct or more incorrect or who knows We're with a certain motive but it's like.

548
00:43:08,874 --> 00:43:10,400
Speaker 0: it's not like a set in stone thing.

549
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,530
Speaker 0: It's like actually part of the game like you're playing this numbers game.

550
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:18,504
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, this lore is like an actual Object, right?

551
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:22,033
Speaker 1: Well, you know what else does a shade of the lore.

552
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:32,020
Speaker 0: edits are in effect like inventory items in a sense But you need that knowledge and to read that lore in order to you know, do and accomplish certain quest.

553
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,302
Speaker 1: Heaven's vault.

554
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:37,495
Speaker 1: we're similar like you're learning the language and learning the lore as a mechanic in the course of play.

555
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:41,168
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm There's also I mean so many.

556
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:45,754
Speaker 0: that's a story game like if you're not paying it, you know If you don't pay attention to the story, there's literally no game.

557
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:46,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, like what are you doing?

558
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,340
Speaker 0: Missed.

559
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:52,220
Speaker 0: it's like I guess in mist you could solve a bunch of puzzles and not but it's like they do it.

560
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,540
Speaker 0: You wouldn't care about something.

561
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:58,939
Speaker 1: Hades is interesting in that it basically it is a solid just game to play.

562
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:02,700
Speaker 1: They basically instead of like getting a heart container.

563
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:07,400
Speaker 1: It also gives you some lower as you get better at the game like oh, yeah, you beat that thing.

564
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,290
Speaker 1: Now you can find out what this guy's deal is.

565
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:17,260
Speaker 1: and just because the game's well-written You're kind of excited about that and that is it diffuses itself throughout the rest of the game pretty well.

566
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,709
Speaker 1: I think Hades does lower very well as well.

567
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:27,476
Speaker 0: the lore in Hades comes in the form of Dialogue, right like RPG text box dialogue and it's never that long.

568
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:29,944
Speaker 0: It's like you that's the key right, it's not.

569
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:30,185
Speaker 0: it's.

570
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:31,549
Speaker 0: it's like you'll talk.

571
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,338
Speaker 0: you go around and talk to someone and there'll be a few sentences.

572
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:41,179
Speaker 0: and it's like If you do something, there'll be a few more sentences, right and you're never like reading pages and pages of stuff.

573
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:44,179
Speaker 0: You're never there watching a long-ass cutscene.

574
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but they're able to reveal a lot in with very little.

575
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:49,439
Speaker 0: so yep.

576
00:44:49,900 --> 00:45:01,250
Speaker 1: But then because you that has been revealed to you those characters when they give their little one-liners along the way in the like Stock encounters that are not changing anything about the game other than your particular run.

577
00:45:01,671 --> 00:45:09,437
Speaker 1: that does color your perception and feeling about the experience Just like the the example you gave about a Metroid game and a piece of lore in a room.

578
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:13,828
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, I think overall right?

579
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:19,119
Speaker 0: It's like, you know lore is good, you know to have those people who like it.

580
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:21,551
Speaker 0: There's people who ignore it and it.

581
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:25,355
Speaker 0: it doesn't harm them by being there So but can't hurt right.

582
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:30,220
Speaker 0: at the very least It doesn't hurt to have it as long as you don't like make it so intrusive or something.

583
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:36,090
Speaker 0: But I've never I've never seen a game that was like hurt by having lore right, the worst case was they.

584
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:41,619
Speaker 0: someone put a lot of effort into lore that was ignored and That's sad right for the person who made it.

585
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:56,360
Speaker 0: But at the same time if the lore is not integrated Well, if someone's expecting me to like read a fucking book in the middle of playing a game It's like brain, you know, at least my brain doesn't like to do that Even though I like reading and I like playing games.

586
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:56,942
Speaker 0: I don't like to.

587
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:57,705
Speaker 0: it would be this.

588
00:45:57,746 --> 00:46:06,600
Speaker 0: it would be the same in reverse like imagine if I was reading a novel and on Page 10 it was like beat 10 levels of missile command before you can read the next page.

589
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:10,387
Speaker 0: Well, I guess like, you know Move to play missile command right now.

590
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:14,480
Speaker 1: get that shit out of here with a novel you were coming in expecting.

591
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,267
Speaker 1: I just I want this story.

592
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:18,457
Speaker 1: It'll be conveyed to me via words in the movie.

593
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:19,260
Speaker 1: I want this story.

594
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:23,187
Speaker 1: It'll be conveyed to me via Spectacle and also a bunch of words.

595
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:27,179
Speaker 1: but a video game I'm going in or an entertainment software.

596
00:46:27,802 --> 00:46:36,713
Speaker 1: thus me interacting with the software has to be pleasant and Entertaining if that software is just passing me through to a novel.

597
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:39,240
Speaker 1: I would have rather just read a novel the software.

598
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,525
Speaker 1: You could do something right?

599
00:46:40,946 --> 00:46:45,517
Speaker 0: You could have like just included a novel in the box with the game As a PDF.

600
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:49,028
Speaker 0: They do or they sell them separately.

601
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,396
Speaker 0: right and it's like on the one hand.

602
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:56,934
Speaker 0: I'm not the kind of person It's like if I see a book that has a game brand on it, right?

603
00:46:57,035 --> 00:47:01,900
Speaker 0: I'm not likely to think I'm Honestly, right going to think less of that book, right?

604
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,750
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna think that it's like a great book worth my time reading.

605
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:13,300
Speaker 0: but if the book is like included It's tough cuz how you know, I guess it would have to be in the old days when it was physical buying of games

606
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:21,465
Speaker 1: Like if I was a kid and they released us like Zelda 4 came out on the Super Nintendo or something like an Zelda that we didn't exist.

607
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:25,420
Speaker 1: and I put myself in that mindset of being a kid and there was a version of that game.

608
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,533
Speaker 1: that Came with a book about Zelda and Zelda lore.

609
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:31,880
Speaker 1: I would have read that thing cover to cover problems.

610
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:37,310
Speaker 0: If I buy a game on Steam and there's a PDF I probably won't even know that PDF is there.

611
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:39,279
Speaker 0: or if there's an e-book I won't even know it's there.

612
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:44,932
Speaker 0: But if I go back in time It's like I buy a big old PC game in a giant box that there's just.

613
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:48,598
Speaker 0: it's a big cardboard with a tiny CD jewel Case in there, right?

614
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,800
Speaker 0: It's like sieve 2 came with a big old rule book and that was rules and I read a lot of it, right?

615
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,812
Speaker 0: It's like if mech warrior 2 came with a lore book.

616
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,600
Speaker 0: I would have read that lore book.

617
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:06,400
Speaker 1: Yeah I didn't know much about the lore of the battle tech universe until RIT even though I knew I knew it existed.

618
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:08,069
Speaker 0: I knew a lot of it.

619
00:48:08,129 --> 00:48:10,260
Speaker 0: Thanks to the there being a battle tech cartoon.

620
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,165
Speaker 0: That helped a lot.

621
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:24,940
Speaker 0: I knew what like mech warrior on the Super Nintendo taught me Yeah But anyway It doesn't hurt to have it But if you don't integrate it a lot of people are going to ignore it which is sad.

622
00:48:25,382 --> 00:48:27,759
Speaker 0: You should integrate it no matter what kind of game it is.

623
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,180
Speaker 0: It should it just be off to the side as like a wall of text, right?

624
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:34,987
Speaker 1: Do integrate.

625
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:39,986
Speaker 1: people won't call it lower like people Right.

626
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:44,580
Speaker 0: It's like when I say lower I'm talking about all you know, but usually fictional.

627
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:53,293
Speaker 0: You know storytelling that is attached to the game, but most people are talking about Walls of text that you can ignore.

628
00:48:53,313 --> 00:49:04,630
Speaker 1: Yep in video games This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

629
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:09,430
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

630

631
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:22,050
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 0: Geek nights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

633
00:49:27,212 --> 00:49:33,395
Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night

634
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:52,830
Speaker 1: and the patreon patrons for this episode of geek nights are Ellen Joyce link Eiji dread lily Tenebrae case care makes music Chris Haddad Clinton Walton deaths Finn Joel Hayes penny rhymer Rebecca Dunn Sam Erickson Shervin von Horo and a bunch of people whose names I'm not going to say at their request.

635
00:49:53,972 --> 00:49:58,410
Speaker 1: So, you know we skip Wednesday last week because we realized something profound about geek nights.

636
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:03,929
Speaker 1: We struggle to do Wednesday shows partly because Scott and I watch radically different media.

637
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:06,257
Speaker 1: But why is that a problem now?

638
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:18,515
Speaker 1: because Wednesday geek nights is the only geek nights where our sole topic is the consumption of media and Reacting to our consumption of media.

639
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:20,421
Speaker 1: It's not like games where they're.

640
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:25,513
Speaker 1: it's not the active pursuits or the areas where we have some actual Expertise.

641
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:27,322
Speaker 1: so it's sort of a weird day.

642
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:37,643
Speaker 1: So we are currently working on Retooling Wednesday geek nights in some fashion and we're also consider we're gonna add we're gonna do something We haven't done in like 14 years.

643
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:47,138
Speaker 1: We might add a couple of segments to geek nights and change up a few of the existing segments Possibly trialing them on Wednesday episodes.

644
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:48,624
Speaker 1: So stay tuned on that.

645
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:55,746
Speaker 1: the next Wednesday episode May in fact be a discussion of how we're going to retool Wednesday geek nights.

646
00:50:56,508 --> 00:50:57,230
Speaker 1: you heard it here first.

647
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:01,740
Speaker 1: No one will know this unless they listened to the stinger on this episode at least for now.

648
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:09,692
Speaker 1: So, uh, I leave you as The final stinger stinger With.

649
00:51:09,752 --> 00:51:10,133
Speaker 2: I don't know.

650
00:51:10,174 --> 00:51:13,485
Speaker 2: she's like move your skulls to the basement because I got these drapes.

651
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:14,890
Speaker 2: I don't even get that.

652
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,452
Speaker 2: I'm like honey.

653
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:16,175
Speaker 2: This is work.

654
00:51:16,516 --> 00:51:17,239
Speaker 2: Are you serious?

655
00:51:17,259 --> 00:51:19,146
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't put him in the basement.

656
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:19,568
Speaker 2: I mean, man.

657
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:22,419
Speaker 2: So I said fine.

658
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:22,923
Speaker 2: I'll do it.

659
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:23,970
Speaker 2: I'll put him in the basement.

660
00:51:24,111 --> 00:51:26,664
Speaker 2: I started taking him down, you know, and I'm moving him one at a time.

661
00:51:26,685 --> 00:51:27,690
Speaker 2: All right, right, right.

662
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,339
Speaker 2: I'm just kind of waiting to see what she does.

663
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,009
Speaker 2: I want to see how she's gonna react to it.

664
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,280
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she's like, you know, can you put a tarp over him?

665
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:34,742
Speaker 2: Also?

666
00:51:34,922 --> 00:51:38,172
Speaker 2: Oh, no, like no, I'm not Damn it.

667
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:40,721
Speaker 2: I'm not gonna put a tarp over these things Dennis.

668
00:51:40,741 --> 00:51:41,202
Speaker 1: That's fine.

669
00:51:41,222 --> 00:51:42,025
Speaker 2: I'll collection man.

670
00:51:42,086 --> 00:51:43,310
Speaker 2: I know it's my skull collection.

671
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,681
Speaker 2: I worked hard to get these things and we're turning clean them.

672
00:51:47,202 --> 00:51:47,523
Speaker 2: fine.

673
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:48,346
Speaker 2: Fine.

674
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:49,610
Speaker 2: I'll put him in the basement.

675
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,181
Speaker 2: Let's put him in the basement.

676
00:51:51,222 --> 00:51:52,330
Speaker 2: But now why cover him?

677
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,943
Speaker 2: What is the point of covering them if you're gonna display him?

678
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:56,330
Speaker 2: if I can't display him up top?

679
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,060
Speaker 2: I'll put him in the basement and display them but then put a tarp.

680
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:02,250
Speaker 1: No fucking way right on and absolutely course.
