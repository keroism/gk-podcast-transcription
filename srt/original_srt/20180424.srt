1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,856
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 24th 2018.

2
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:11,561
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:23,886
Speaker 0: We are back from PAX East with a Tuesday episode talking about quantitative easing the game and Yogi the game.

4
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:35,780
Speaker 0: Let's do this So with all the games that we're playing right now or that we want to be playing because it's really gaming season hard lately.

5
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,964
Speaker 0: PC gaming always gaming season, but it's exploding even more And I think it's partly just that.

6
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:44,640
Speaker 0: a bunch of games that I am specifically interested in are all available at the same time.

7
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:46,152
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not just games.

8
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:46,999
Speaker 1: It's all media.

9
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:52,219
Speaker 1: This has been a problem since geek night started it that the rate of media creation has gone up so high.

10
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:58,526
Speaker 1: Even though you like all these things you do not have time to consume even a small fraction of all the.

11
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,075
Speaker 0: there were droughts in anime where I like.

12
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:08,980
Speaker 0: there wasn't a lot of anime I care to watch and There's a ton again because now over the past say like two three years the problem has gotten even worse.

13
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:13,976
Speaker 0: yep, but PC gaming is having it to a degree that I can't deal with.

14
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:18,134
Speaker 0: I Haven't even played like slay the spire enough to where I'm done with it.

15
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:19,560
Speaker 1: I do the daily thing every day.

16
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:20,999
Speaker 0: I do too that games real good.

17
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:31,648
Speaker 0: But I completely forgot that that battle tech game the one that is literally just the pen and paper and dice game actual battle time PC is Coming out one like today.

18
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:33,116
Speaker 1: I think I think is out now.

19
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:37,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Completely forgot about it to the point that I don't even remember if I kick-started it.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:47,125
Speaker 1: I don't think I did but I think well I saw it at a PAX booth and then a kick-started it and I saw it Again at a PAX booth and then I had faith in it and then I said, okay And then why are they?

21
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:48,270
Speaker 1: even though I had already paid for it.

22
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,414
Speaker 1: I got faith in it afterwards.

23
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:49,675
Speaker 0: Yep.

24
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:59,602
Speaker 0: I know I read I Exactly one review from someone I trusted who said and I quote it's just regular old battle tech That's it.

25
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,488
Speaker 1: Well, I said I think it was gonna be.

26
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:02,311
Speaker 0: that's all I wanted.

27
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:04,760
Speaker 0: That's all I've wanted for like 20 years.

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,455
Speaker 1: It's like playing the new xcom game.

29
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:20,548
Speaker 0: only Max, yeah But it's the mech logic and the mech mechanics that I know and love and don't have time to bust out fucking mech maker and make a mech for three hours and then Fill in a bunch of dogs.

30
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:25,089
Speaker 1: It takes three hours to make a man You can just print out pre-made mechs.

31
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:25,932
Speaker 0: We never did that.

32
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:34,560
Speaker 0: We always spent forever making our goddamn like Team of us 80-ton and a 60-ton and all our nonsense and we'd all have to look through the books.

33
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,488
Speaker 0: I remember how whatever worked Mmm, everyone wanted a targeting computer.

34
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:39,571
Speaker 0: So we banned it.

35
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,240
Speaker 1: Everyone bans targeting computers plus two on everything.

36
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:49,662
Speaker 0: Yep We also I remember specifically We only looked at tonnage and we never looked at money because it was just too much of a pain in the ass to keep Track of money.

37
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:54,579
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, which is kind of a problem because you could just make the most expensive back anyway.

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,939
Speaker 0: Despite all this What did I spend all last night doing?

39
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:07,785
Speaker 0: Getting a regional doom - like actual original code in DOS box Playable on my PC.

40
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:13,505
Speaker 0: Yes, you get the steam doom - it is but it's the steam doom - is one of the first things I ever bought on Steam.

41
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:14,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too.

42
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:21,720
Speaker 0: Okay, and it is just DOS box Yeah, meaning I had to like configure the controls.

43
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaker 1: No, you when you install the steam doom - it I mean yeah sets up some DOS box.

44
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:32,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what you do is you just go to the directory where it's at Yeah, and you notice in that directory.

45
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,371
Speaker 1: There are some precious wad files.

46
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,280
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, then you get some Z do whatever.

47
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,468
Speaker 1: Nope, whatever the newest hotness is.

48
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've done that before.

49
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:42,980
Speaker 0: I've played doom a lot on the newest hotness.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,788
Speaker 0: Whatever Z doom Jen all those different dooms.

51
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:56,400
Speaker 1: I felt like playing doom in its original Unadulterated purest form because you can set you can take those new ones and say play it without any mods just play doom.

52
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not the same.

53
00:03:58,587 --> 00:03:59,511
Speaker 1: It is if you tell it.

54
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,658
Speaker 1: Yeah make the resolution 320 by whatever.

55
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:08,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, and don't you can use this shade, you know, just another thing I had to do is yeah I had I had this custom com file.

56
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:13,360
Speaker 0: I used to use to remove vertical mouse input while I was playing.

57
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:21,089
Speaker 0: Okay, so your guy wouldn't move forward and back when you move the mouse forward and back by accident because he can only aim left and right and I won't.

58
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,760
Speaker 0: I didn't fix that.

59
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,908
Speaker 0: I figured I'd play With even less than I had back then.

60
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:33,808
Speaker 0: the other thing I had back when I was a kid is I had modded my own Doom to add a crosshair on The screen to help my aiming.

61
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:36,238
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I didn't go in and like mess.

62
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,813
Speaker 1: with that You mean aiming and doom is pretty easy.

63
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,940
Speaker 1: You don't really need a crosshair.

64
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,980
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say is having placed the imp in the middle of the screen.

65
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna hit.

66
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:49,980
Speaker 0: having played doom to deathmatch with you I feel like you do not have a solid grasp on what it takes to be good at doom.

67
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,950
Speaker 1: I mean good enough a doom I could beat it.

68
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:54,020
Speaker 0: Could you could you be doomed to you?

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,482
Speaker 1: Why not?

70
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,608
Speaker 1: nowadays I just go.

71
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,984
Speaker 1: I just you know, my strategy is not the best But I is your strategy.

72
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:06,668
Speaker 0: the way I usually play which is slow and steady hoarding items minimum ammo usage forever Except for in certain parts.

73
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,923
Speaker 1: then I space Lee it's mostly that strategy But it's certain parts.

74
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:13,374
Speaker 1: I switch to the run really fast get to the exit on my god strategy.

75
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:13,896
Speaker 1: Yep.

76
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,039
Speaker 0: I Gotta say though playing doom - felt real good.

77
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:24,520
Speaker 0: And if no if there weren't other games to play I feel like I might have been satisfied with games like doom.

78
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:25,282
Speaker 1: Why not?

79
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:30,077
Speaker 0: It's also it reminded me of something of how utterly fucking fast that game is.

80
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Which we saw again.

81
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:34,973
Speaker 0: We were at magfest playing quake one deathmatch.

82
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,480
Speaker 0: Even that game is fast.

83
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:37,727
Speaker 0: Anyway, I digress.

84
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:38,652
Speaker 0: battle takes coming out.

85
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,064
Speaker 1: I Feel like is out.

86
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:55,560
Speaker 0: we're gonna play a ton of it and I feel like you should get on this train early Because if enough of you have this game like imminently then in the forum I think we can organize some games because frankly I don't want to play battletech single-player on a plane against humans.

87
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,729
Speaker 1: I don't know if the multiplayer is in there yet or not.

88
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:01,262
Speaker 0: Uh, I saw some notes about how there's Kick.

89
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:06,220
Speaker 1: we kicked it enough to the point at which I think it's was like the stretch goal was reached.

90
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:10,659
Speaker 0: Says there's a service you have to use and it links to your steam account if you have.

91
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:13,534
Speaker 1: yeah I just don't know if it's in there yet, but I haven't tried it.

92
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:14,419
Speaker 0: I will figure it out.

93
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,945
Speaker 1: I'll play in some battles like when I go home.

94
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:17,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not doing nothing else.

95
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,277
Speaker 0: I gotta go to work tomorrow.

96
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:19,900
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

97
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,292
Speaker 0: You got any news other than battle tech.

98
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:27,785
Speaker 1: I do have a news so homebrew people everywhere real excited.

99
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:33,822
Speaker 1: an exploit has been found for the Nintendo switch and all and video Tegra based Systems.

100
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:39,339
Speaker 0: I wouldn't care as much except I just want to put an emulator with every like NES and SNES game on there.

101
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so here's how that.

102
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:49,980
Speaker 1: here's the deal is that this is not a perfect tag You know, it's not you know, wonderful and elegant and whatever.

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,572
Speaker 1: But it can't be fixed with a firmware by Nintendo.

104
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:57,508
Speaker 1: all they can fix future switch models like but they have to.

105
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:07,333
Speaker 1: they can't fix the ones you've already got because this involves basically putting the USB port into like some debug recovery mode.

106
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:21,460
Speaker 1: so you can either open your switch and like Hit some pins or on the right side on the side of the switch where the joy con connects That's basically a USB port that the that the joy con is making contact with on the on the side of the switch.

107
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:37,360
Speaker 1: Yeah you can short out some pins on there to put the USB port in a certain like mode and Then you pump it full of data and then there's an overflow and then you can get the switch to run any code you Want which means you can just get it to run Linux or whatever the fuck and that's that.

108
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:37,820
Speaker 0: Yeah

109
00:07:38,581 --> 00:08:05,131
Speaker 1: so this is good news because it means they'll probably be like some kit you can buy where like you slide something down the side of your switch and then you push some buttons and then Suddenly your switch is running, you know some home brew software thing, but then you're probably gonna be giving up on like like even though you know you can basically always do this exploit.

110
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:14,300
Speaker 1: there could be a situation where you Nintendo sends out a firmware that then sees that you have shit installed on your switch and then ruins your switch, right?

111
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,280
Speaker 1: So even though you could just exploit it again you I don't know if you can exploit it again if it's wrecked.

112
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:24,423
Speaker 1: So it's still something that they can ever patch.

113
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:32,995
Speaker 1: so what you can do is my strategy is I'm gonna wait basically until the switch is Rip right done no more games for switch.

114
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:33,818
Speaker 1: something else is out.

115
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:44,015
Speaker 1: That means no more firmware updates for switch, which means ah now I can totally unlock this switch No problem, right same thing right now wheeze wheeze are done, right?

116
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,300
Speaker 1: They even shut off the wheeze store.

117
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:48,127
Speaker 1: Yep, so we home brew is a real deal.

118
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:50,863
Speaker 1: if you got a we sitting around Homebrew that is.

119
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:57,162
Speaker 0: but unlike the Wii the Nintendo switch like the hardware is really nice and the form factor and yeah No, that's the.

120
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:57,583
Speaker 1: this is the.

121
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:01,316
Speaker 1: you know, I mean people have gotten PSPs and stuff before.

122
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,644
Speaker 1: but it's like, you know The switch is like.

123
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:07,660
Speaker 1: that is some nice hard portable hardware with all sorts of fancy biz.

124
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,111
Speaker 0: You'll be able to play the shit out of some ROMs.

125
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:16,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, like SNES ROMs Especially, you know, you can start making games for some labos or whatever.

126
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,280
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the labos forever.

127
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,229
Speaker 0: I haven't even touched a labo yet.

128
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:22,680
Speaker 1: I have a bunch of labos in my house that are.

129
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,870
Speaker 1: Open my labos tomorrow and stream some labo.

130
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,060
Speaker 0: Ooh, maybe I'll stream some doom - I got nothing to do tomorrow.

131
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,475
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna be streaming some battle tech and some labo.

132
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:41,595
Speaker 0: Yeah but anyway things Of the day.

133
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:42,039
Speaker 0: What do you got?

134
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,520
Speaker 1: Remember I think I had a thing of the day a while ago.

135
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,192
Speaker 1: We're like there was a cheese person like guessing it cheese like.

136
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,489
Speaker 1: they gave him two cheeses and then guess which one was fancy Which one was cheap and which ones they were?

137
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember that video.

138
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,342
Speaker 1: I think that same channel also did a video that was like guess the meats and it was all these deli meats and I learned About.

139
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,609
Speaker 1: you know some fancy deli meats.

140
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:02,313
Speaker 1: I didn't know about.

141
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,600
Speaker 0: I like it fancy deli meat.

142
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,760
Speaker 0: Here

143
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:21,908
Speaker 1: is a video from a different channel is a BuzzFeed video where a high quality French baker of bread Reviews and judges the free bread from various crappy American restaurants like Olive Garden Red Lobster and Outback Steakhouse Without knowing which restaurants they come from or anything

144
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:24,775
Speaker 0: based on the first four seconds of this video.

145
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:25,577
Speaker 0: I feel like it's good.

146
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:29,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, so You know I'm into it.

147
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:30,665
Speaker 1: This is a good video.

148
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:43,299
Speaker 0: So if you ever wondered what would happen if you just started screaming at your hard drives The this video is pretty great Because the answer is they will have tons of problems.

149
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,155
Speaker 1: Are they that sensitive to vibration that even the screams will fuck them up?

150
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:52,620
Speaker 0: Yes vibration Really really impacts the performance of spinning discs.

151
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:56,615
Speaker 1: So when they started making cases of those little rubber nubs those actually mattered.

152
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,640
Speaker 0: that mattered a lot.

153
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,984
Speaker 0: Well, so it depends.

154
00:10:59,305 --> 00:10:59,506
Speaker 0: there's.

155
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,132
Speaker 0: there's a lot of complexity here.

156
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:03,600
Speaker 0: So it partly depends on the frequencies of vibration.

157
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:08,941
Speaker 1: Did he try yelling at some that were just screwed down and some that were in rubber nubs and some that were just sitting on The table.

158
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:14,320
Speaker 0: Well, no because in this case the shouting well will affect the inside of the drive irrespective.

159
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:18,160
Speaker 1: Well, the air vibrates and the air hits the side of the hard drive.

160
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,123
Speaker 1: Yeah That vibrates.

161
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:23,019
Speaker 0: videos great because you see this dude literally just going up to a j-bot and just like screaming into it.

162
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,660
Speaker 0: How loud do you got a scream as loud as a normal human and you see these huge latency spikes?

163
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,702
Speaker 0: Immediately.

164
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,913
Speaker 1: You sure this isn't some kind of setup where?

165
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:33,360
Speaker 0: no this is a hundred percent legit.

166
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,279
Speaker 0: This is Sun like doing this part of a PSA kind of thing, I guess.

167
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:41,260
Speaker 0: But I can say this is true and it's kind of relevant to your son.

168
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,049
Speaker 1: Son is Evan and bought by Oracle a long time ago.

169
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,634
Speaker 0: Well son is fish works team.

170
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,320
Speaker 1: I thought son is dead.

171
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:49,289
Speaker 0: It's Oracle's fish works team.

172
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:55,308
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but this is the that like Oracle This dude is well known in IT circles.

173
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:55,849
Speaker 1: Okay.

174
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,740
Speaker 0: Anyway, the cool thing about it is that done as a neighbor fool.

175
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,519
Speaker 0: Wait, that would have been great.

176
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:06,980
Speaker 0: But way back when I bought that NAS and I was talking about how there's normal net like there's drives.

177
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,900
Speaker 0: You can buy hard drives that say this is for a NAS and then there's more expensive drives You can buy that say this is for a professional NAS.

178
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,330
Speaker 0: The difference between those two?

179
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,879
Speaker 1: they got rubber nubs on the inside.

180
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:21,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of charge you a hundred bucks for a rubber.

181
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:30,411
Speaker 0: No, the fancier ones are louder hotter use more power But they are more resistant to vibration.

182
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:31,576
Speaker 1: Are they spinning faster?

183
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,849
Speaker 0: Uh Depends depends on exactly.

184
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:35,613
Speaker 1: how are they avoid?

185
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:38,012
Speaker 1: How are they preventing the Do?

186
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,960
Speaker 1: they have like little shocks on the inside like when you bring it's usually at some sort of physical charge.

187
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,606
Speaker 1: You all that money for some Springs.

188
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:44,750
Speaker 0: It's not just Springs.

189
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,894
Speaker 0: It's a little more complex than that.

190
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:55,666
Speaker 0: Oh, they are the pneumatic shocks Hydraulic shot, but that's also why if you consumer NAS is don't really have more than five slots maybe six.

191
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:07,720
Speaker 0: because if you have more than that the Synchronous movement of the heads on all the drives and the spinning of all the drives combined will cause Vibrations that cascade with each other and cause similar effects, but just put shocks in the NAS.

192
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:10,168
Speaker 1: Each drive is bouncing and flowing individually.

193
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:10,850
Speaker 0: It's not enough.

194
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:12,937
Speaker 1: Just get good NAS of SSDs.

195
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:13,800
Speaker 1: It'd be so much smaller.

196
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:16,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the SSDs of course are not affected by this.

197
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,341
Speaker 1: I can't wait until we have like multi terabyte SSDs like eight terabyte SSD hundred dollars Cuz.

198
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:30,903
Speaker 1: then I'll have this NAS like seven of them and it'll be this tiny little box I can put in the closet where no one even knows and Wi-Fi will be so fast by then It won't even matter.

199
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:45,634
Speaker 0: I remember when a 16 megabyte flash drive was amazing and expensive and I remember when the first one like the first SSD I bought was 12 gigabytes and I paid a lot of money for that thing.

200
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:53,760
Speaker 0: in the meta moment The geek nights book club book is still Emily Wilson's modern translation of the Odyssey by Homa.

201
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:57,704
Speaker 1: I guess I'll be reading some of that this week Nothing else.

202
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,460
Speaker 0: I suspect you didn't read any since the last time still hanging out with Nestor.

203
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,460
Speaker 1: Well, I read I got a pile of reading and I read some comics and now it's all right.

204
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,310
Speaker 0: No, you got you got to uh, Odysseus finally.

205
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,691
Speaker 0: Yeah.

206
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, it won't take me that long.

207
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:11,320
Speaker 1: That book goes fast.

208
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:19,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, once you once you get past now, she could just sort of it just sort of flies by And a bigger percentage of it is.

209
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:20,880
Speaker 0: he's already home.

210
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:21,562
Speaker 0: Now.

211
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:23,248
Speaker 0: what then I remembered?

212
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,794
Speaker 1: I thought that was just like the end part.

213
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot going on.

214
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,491
Speaker 0: That's a long bit that happens there.

215
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:28,933
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

216
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,180
Speaker 1: I thought it was just like final chapter.

217
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,085
Speaker 1: He gets I don't remember.

218
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,580
Speaker 0: he shows up and like disguises himself and known.

219
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that was all the last chapter right and bit by bit.

220
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,420
Speaker 0: He's like planning his bullshit.

221
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:38,946
Speaker 1: It's not just one chapter at the end.

222
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:39,750
Speaker 0: There's more going on.

223
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,417
Speaker 0: Okay, it's still good.

224
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:49,657
Speaker 0: I'm really digging it If you're here because you saw us at PAX East 2018 and you're curious about that video of that panel we gave.

225
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:50,140
Speaker 0: well, guess what?

226
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,165
Speaker 0: It's on YouTube.

227
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,580
Speaker 0: link to it right here and you made a mistake.

228
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,360
Speaker 1: First of all, you wasted your time at precious packs time seeing the panel in person when you could have just seen it on YouTube.

229
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:01,468
Speaker 1: Second of all, you made another mistake.

230
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:14,411
Speaker 1: you went on YouTube and watch the panel when you could have been doing something better with it But you could have been playing one of those board games that are just hearing about the 40 tabletop games You must play is on YouTube from packs.

231
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,640
Speaker 1: I recommend playing them instead of watching this YouTube.

232
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:23,213
Speaker 1: well You got to watch the video to find out what they are or click go to the video click on a random time Look at the slide pick that game and play it.

233
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:28,420
Speaker 0: fair warning though As we said in the panel some of those games aren't that good or we don't actually matter.

234
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:30,972
Speaker 1: There's still games that you should play good or bad.

235
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:31,474
Speaker 0: Yep.

236
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:32,680
Speaker 0: The panel is pretty dense.

237
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,756
Speaker 0: Actually, if you click on any random spot in the YouTube video, you're gonna see the name of a game.

238
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:36,540
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

239
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,908
Speaker 0: So beyond that packs West is the next big convention we're gonna be at so stay tuned After the summer and it during the summer.

240
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:45,390
Speaker 1: we just go.

241
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,132
Speaker 1: Ah, it's warm.

242
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:47,016
Speaker 0: Yep.

243
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,100
Speaker 0: You'll see us at packs West.

244
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,010
Speaker 0: You'll probably see me at packs dev with Emily.

245
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:52,452
Speaker 0: probably not.

246
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,756
Speaker 0: Scotty tends not to go to dev.

247
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:54,800
Speaker 1: You want to pay for it?

248
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,775
Speaker 0: I might get you a free badge and give me some more vacation days.

249
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,830
Speaker 0: if you get a free badge Oh, you come give me some vacation because I ain't getting your free hotel.

250
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:02,593
Speaker 0: It's expensive.

251
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:04,419
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right pay for that, too.

252
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,871
Speaker 0: But We geek nights will also be at Zenkai con.

253
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,920
Speaker 0: not this weekend, but is it next weekend?

254
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,482
Speaker 1: I think it's next.

255
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:14,267
Speaker 1: I don't know when the hell it is.

256
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:14,851
Speaker 1: I'm not going there.

257
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,756
Speaker 0: May 4th through 6th.

258
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,233
Speaker 0: I will be there for not be with.

259
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:20,760
Speaker 0: I will be there on the fifth and six.

260
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,300
Speaker 0: I'm doing I think three panels an anime one and two gaming ones.

261
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:25,770
Speaker 0: I think I forget what nope.

262
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,000
Speaker 0: two anime ones in a gaming one.

263
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,853
Speaker 0: I will post the schedule when I get a chance.

264
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,460
Speaker 0: Zenkai con is a pretty good con.

265
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,042
Speaker 0: I'm not you.

266
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:33,688
Speaker 0: it's not the kind of con.

267
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:36,680
Speaker 0: You should fly to Pennsylvania to attend.

268
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:43,540
Speaker 1: You should only go to this thing if you are already very close to it But if you live within like a couple hour drive of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

269
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,677
Speaker 1: I guess if you're a car person, you should definitely go to Zenkai con because it's a pretty good going to.

270
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,624
Speaker 0: if it's convenient It's a pretty legit.

271
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,909
Speaker 0: It's real convenient from New York.

272
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,520
Speaker 0: It's like a trivial Amtrak ride that takes me right to the con.

273
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:56,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, okay.

274
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:03,540
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna be there with many of the people we had review con with and we're just going to play board games all weekend.

275
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:05,398
Speaker 1: You know, I don't need to go to Zenkai con and play board games.

276
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:07,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you got to go where we are to play board games.

277
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,118
Speaker 1: I'm gonna enjoy some good weather go biking or something not spend it inside in the summertime.

278
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:13,327
Speaker 0: It's May.

279
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:14,439
Speaker 0: it's not gonna be that great out yet.

280
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:22,318
Speaker 1: All right, I got one more thing in front of us a meta moment as I tweeted out from the geek nights Twitter account The geek nights logo website, etc.

281
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:31,989
Speaker 1: Design wise I've been fine for ten plus years, but are a bit long in the tooth Yep, so why do some rebrand and get some updating?

282
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:34,415
Speaker 0: it definitely reeks of like web 2.0 point one.

283
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:40,135
Speaker 1: Yeah We want to update that biz, you know, and we want all kinds of stuff.

284
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,180
Speaker 1: We want to get a new website.

285
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,860
Speaker 1: We want to get you know avatars and all the social media accounts graphics to use on YouTube videos that they're all look uniform.

286
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:49,307
Speaker 0: Why are you up?

287
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:57,520
Speaker 1: Graham Graham has to use on Twitch channel Game now 13 fucking years after you started the show cuz I got time now for this.

288
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so I tweeted on the geek nice Twitter account.

289
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,875
Speaker 1: Hey, if anyone knows the graphic designer right hit us up.

290
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:19,818
Speaker 1: and what happened was I got a lot of tweets from people who clearly are desperate graphic designers who searched Twitter for graphic design Saw the tweet replied to it And pretty much the people fell into a few different categories.

291
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:35,030
Speaker 1: right category Number one person who actually seems okay graphic design But clearly only ever does it for eSports customers and has an eSports style Which I guess if you want to go with an eSports Style then any of those people would work.

292
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,820
Speaker 0: welcome to my livestream like and subscribe, right?

293
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:50,448
Speaker 1: But I don't know if that's our visual style that goes well with geek nights to person who is clearly a you know Person who is a good person and maybe even knows who we are or is otherwise like.

294
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:57,180
Speaker 1: a person that I wanted to Choose but clearly is still not yet pro graphic designer.

295
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:07,291
Speaker 1: They're still you know The lower level maybe is still in college or something right and looked at their portfolio and it was not Super ultra pro level like I'm looking for.

296
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,100
Speaker 1: so I was kind of like me.

297
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:11,325
Speaker 1: Right, it's like I could just get.

298
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:15,656
Speaker 1: I have friends who are more experienced right it wasn't?

299
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:20,265
Speaker 1: they weren't talented or skilled They're all way better than me But they were.

300
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,660
Speaker 1: you know, it's like I'm looking for someone who's top tier, right?

301
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:22,881
Speaker 1: Like.

302
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:29,360
Speaker 1: I guess it's unfair to be comparing them to like top design agencies But that's kind of what I want if I'm gonna put in the effort, right?

303
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,930
Speaker 1: I want like the you know, something that will last 30 years.

304
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,994
Speaker 0: I guess case in point.

305
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:33,737
Speaker 0: We're gonna pay.

306
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:40,300
Speaker 1: it's not like right Obviously paying real money like thousands of dollars maybe even more who knows, right?

307
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:47,813
Speaker 1: and the third category was Desperate no talent person who's just right if someone's come?

308
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:57,540
Speaker 1: and I realized if someone's comings like Beg for grab if someone's oh, I was asking the listeners of geek nights for recommendations of graphic designers.

309
00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,600
Speaker 1: But all of us getting was graphic designers recommending themselves.

310
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:11,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you had to recommend yourself and you don't have a constant line of work It could be because you're not the best graphic designer If someone really is super ultra Pro like I'm looking for.

311
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:12,760
Speaker 1: they have work.

312
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:19,100
Speaker 0: I got a couple contacts with some good firms that do it and I got a follow-up to get a quote.

313
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,660
Speaker 1: So I've seen some websites that are the places where the pro graphic designers hang out.

314
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:28,777
Speaker 1: But they want to charge you a few hundred bucks to put a posting on there with your job listing.

315
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:32,992
Speaker 1: So it's like Do I want to pay that few hundred bucks to put the listing?

316
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:42,412
Speaker 1: that would probably work because I could just write the creative Brief put it up there and then you know get people from saying hey, you know with pitches and stuff and that might work But a few hundred bucks.

317
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:49,540
Speaker 0: Yeah Well divide a few hundred bucks by five and just put it on fiverr and get like 40 people to write.

318
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:53,151
Speaker 1: I don't want the fiverr level of person right?

319
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:56,040
Speaker 1: I want if I want the the dribble level of person.

320
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,807
Speaker 1: So we'll see how that goes.

321
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:11,819
Speaker 1: but if anyone out there knows or is a Not necessarily the highest possible s-rank a graphic designer But like a a rank right someone who has experienced talented, you know, etc.

322
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:22,560
Speaker 1: I tried to contact the people who made like to take this and penny arcade logos, but their contact form is broken Which either means they have the money or but the point is that's the tier we're looking for.

323
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:30,220
Speaker 0: They either have plenty of work and they don't notice that it's broken Or they don't have enough work and they're wondering why no one likes them anymore.

324
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,272
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's that.

325
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:38,176
Speaker 0: so yeah We played a bunch of games recently and we're gonna see her at PAX East.

326
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:38,880
Speaker 1: he played game.

327
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,857
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're gonna review two games, which we are normally hesitant to do, but I don't follow.

328
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:44,840
Speaker 1: the games are so tiny.

329
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:48,560
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a full episode worth for each.

330
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:48,884
Speaker 1: That's.

331
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:51,148
Speaker 1: the problem is that you know There's a lot of a lot of the content.

332
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:53,380
Speaker 1: when you don't have a lot of time to consume content, right?

333
00:21:53,802 --> 00:22:07,029
Speaker 1: You often have small amounts of free time and in a small amount of free time You can instead of consuming a piece of a large amount of content like say playing the first hour of Chrono Trigger And then never finishing it You just find a small piece of content.

334
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,290
Speaker 1: but a small piece of content like a game that takes 20 minutes Isn't something you can do a whole geek nights episode about?

335
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:14,337
Speaker 1: so so we're gonna mix them up.

336
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:18,371
Speaker 0: So QE That's what he stands for the game.

337
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:27,202
Speaker 0: Just called QE like you'll hear Tabletop nerds who found out about this game or know about it usually because the Kickstarter they'll just say QE like hey You want to play QE?

338
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:27,985
Speaker 1: What is QE?

339
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:31,737
Speaker 1: It is quantitative easing which is a word I've heard before.

340
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:32,600
Speaker 1: but what does it mean?

341
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,959
Speaker 1: So the gist of the game, what does quantitative easing mean if someone says that in real life?

342
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,511
Speaker 0: It actually means pretty much the same thing that happens in the game.

343
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:51,860
Speaker 0: Okay, so in this game You are all Sovereign nations and you're in charge of those sovereign nations sovereign banks.

344
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:53,847
Speaker 0: Okay, you can print.

345
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,694
Speaker 1: I'm like the chairman of the the Fed.

346
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can print money.

347
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:58,607
Speaker 0: cool You can just be like.

348
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,860
Speaker 0: you can print infinite money.

349
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,620
Speaker 0: This is imagine playing Monopoly where everyone has infinity dollars to spend all the time.

350
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:08,826
Speaker 1: How is this game not stupid?

351
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:13,760
Speaker 0: So this games core can see this is this is one of those like toy games.

352
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,631
Speaker 0: This is a very very very very simple game that Largely serves to illustrate a couple of interesting points.

353
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:23,157
Speaker 1: I'm asking these questions facetiously.

354
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:28,190
Speaker 0: I play oh, yeah and Partly just to make this experience happen.

355
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:31,060
Speaker 0: So basically you are sovereign nation.

356
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:34,591
Speaker 0: you can print unlimited money and you take turns.

357
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:38,362
Speaker 0: look as a group a series of Failing.

358
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:43,780
Speaker 0: giant companies will appear and you bid on who is going to bail them out.

359
00:23:44,821 --> 00:24:00,025
Speaker 1: so whoever bids the most money is so basically there's a company going out of business say an airline and The UK and Germany in the US and Japan are all like, all right We're gonna bail out this, you know Airlines so they don't go out of business.

360
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:08,480
Speaker 1: and then everyone says how much money they're gonna spend to bail them out and the company Says oh, well that US is gonna spend the most to bail us out.

361
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:13,780
Speaker 1: We will move our airline to the US and be bailed out by them because we went to these other countries.

362
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,264
Speaker 1: They would give us less money.

363
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:16,368
Speaker 1: and that's that.

364
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,735
Speaker 0: so you just go around.

365
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:20,440
Speaker 0: one like it'll be a player's turn.

366
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,020
Speaker 0: No have to get into all the details that we will be able to explain all the details.

367
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Speaker 0: There's not that much to this game.

368
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:26,388
Speaker 0: No But everyone secretly bids.

369
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:31,325
Speaker 0: one player will openly bid and that sets the lines They write on number on a piece of paper.

370
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:36,503
Speaker 0: It can literally be any number any positive It could be.

371
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,226
Speaker 1: it could be one.

372
00:24:37,547 --> 00:24:38,230
Speaker 1: It can't be zero.

373
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,053
Speaker 1: It's not positive.

374
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:43,391
Speaker 1: It could be nine nine nine It could be 69 it could be 420.

375
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:45,440
Speaker 0: Kickstarter shows someone writing two billion.

376
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,664
Speaker 1: It could be six six six.

377
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:49,013
Speaker 1: It could be a hundred infinity.

378
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:50,860
Speaker 1: It could be any positive integer.

379
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:54,040
Speaker 1: Everyone else biggest infinity is not an integer.

380
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,344
Speaker 1: But you know you get the idea.

381
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:57,169
Speaker 0: everyone else bid secretly.

382
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:11,956
Speaker 0: the person who publicly bid then takes everyone secret bid Looks at them all Determines the winner based on who bid the most Gives them that card that they just bid on which is where the victory points is the end of the game and That's it.

383
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:12,929
Speaker 0: You just keep doing this.

384
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:15,841
Speaker 1: All you're doing is there's a card that is worth victory points.

385
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:18,290
Speaker 1: you bid a positive integer of money.

386
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:20,327
Speaker 1: You have infinite money on it.

387
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:26,067
Speaker 1: Whoever bids the most gets the victory points and every turn one player sees all the bids.

388
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,348
Speaker 0: but no one else does right.

389
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:36,114
Speaker 1: So you have some amount of information because every turn there's a one public bid and every turn you know You bid and you know whether you won or lost and you know What the public bid was.

390
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,990
Speaker 1: and on your turn when you're making the public bid you see all the other bids.

391
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:43,950
Speaker 1: So you get information about what other people are bidding but not all the information.

392
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:53,048
Speaker 0: I saw rounds where I wrote 50 and I was the one like running the auction and the bids I received Ranged from zero to all.

393
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:56,684
Speaker 1: right All right, you can do zero when it when you're not the public bid.

394
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:59,875
Speaker 0: No, so That's it.

395
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:05,050
Speaker 0: you just bid on these things printing Unlimited money until they've all been auctioned off, right?

396
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,645
Speaker 1: So the things you're bidding on are worth victory points.

397
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:10,159
Speaker 1: at the end of the game Some of them get bonus victory points.

398
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:14,179
Speaker 1: if you make sets or if they match our country It doesn't matter has a particular kind of thing.

399
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,103
Speaker 0: They're trying right.

400
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:16,670
Speaker 1: someone's like the airline specialist.

401
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:18,090
Speaker 1: They get more points from Airlines.

402
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:20,730
Speaker 1: Whatever the point is you bidding on things that are worth victory points.

403
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,095
Speaker 1: But here's the game.

404
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:23,760
Speaker 1: after all the things have been bid on.

405
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:34,070
Speaker 0: whoever has the most victory points wins Except Whoever bid the most total money is eliminated from the game before you score, right?

406
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,008
Speaker 1: So whoever is second place wins.

407
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,549
Speaker 1: Well, it's buta babel.

408
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,005
Speaker 1: Well, it's actually possible that you would bid the most money and not have the most victory point.

409
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:52,570
Speaker 1: that is easily possible But basically so because you got to imagine well If it was just most victory points wins you would try to bid is the highest possible number every round.

410
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:59,330
Speaker 1: Try to bid as close to infinity as you can every round To guarantee that you winning the victory points and at the end you win.

411
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:05,450
Speaker 0: So I guess the fiction here is that whoever was eliminated printed so much money that they ruined their own sovereign nation's currents.

412
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,518
Speaker 1: Well, you might think well, here's my strategy.

413
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,703
Speaker 1: I'll just bid second, you know, and every time I'm bidding on something I'll bid less than the person who's gonna bid.

414
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:20,670
Speaker 1: I'll figure out based on the info I know what the high bids gonna be and one under that good fucking luck playing played this game with smart people.

415
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:25,110
Speaker 1: Well, if you do that if you always bid like a dollar under the high bid, guess what?

416
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,457
Speaker 1: You won't win any victory points.

417
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:28,730
Speaker 1: Someone else with the high bid will take the victory points.

418
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:37,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need to make the high bid and win some victory points But you need to make those high bids in all those high bids when added up.

419
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:45,430
Speaker 1: You got to make them low right And that way you actually acquire some victory point cards with some bids.

420
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:59,086
Speaker 1: But when other people bid and acquire victory point cards that you want then to be spending more than you're spending when you're getting victory Point card, but just this concept of whoever spent the most is eliminated Then we score is so well.

421
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:07,379
Speaker 1: It prevents the game from being stupid and allows you to have this mechanic of bid whatever the hell you want because it's like Okay, I'll be whatever hell I want two billion.

422
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,490
Speaker 1: Oh, you just lost the game because now we're all bidding like 50 and 100.

423
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:16,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll never add up to two billion ever But it ends up being really fun as a toy game like.

424
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:26,600
Speaker 0: I want to play this again, and I feel like it's something I'll bust out periodically because it doesn't take long to play at all and You can be clever like in our first playthrough.

425
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,909
Speaker 0: We saw such things as someone made the opening bid $1 So no one else had any measure to gauge how much to bid would be.

426
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:51,112
Speaker 1: great Is if like the person to your I forget writer like whatever, you know Like if you're the first person to bid openly and one of the bids is like ridiculously high and it's secret But you know and you give that person the winning thing and then you view that it's like they bid a billion you start bidding Like next round.

427
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,697
Speaker 1: you're just like a hundred million on.

428
00:28:52,878 --> 00:29:04,986
Speaker 1: you could just also bid high numbers knowing you'll never have more money than that Right, but you'll totally win all these victory points Right, and if they keep going if they keep going with the number they started with like billions and billions.

429
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,731
Speaker 1: It's like I It's.

430
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:08,737
Speaker 0: it's cool though, like.

431
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:10,610
Speaker 0: I'm glad this game like the Kickstarter succeeded.

432
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,031
Speaker 0: It's it.

433
00:29:11,593 --> 00:29:19,582
Speaker 0: it's such a simple toy game and I feel like if I ever give a lecture Where I need to illustrate these kinds of principles, right?

434
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:21,970
Speaker 0: This is way better than the dollar auction.

435
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like these games.

436
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:24,268
Speaker 1: where?

437
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,896
Speaker 1: Buddha bevel was the same one.

438
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:30,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like your tower of the gods build a tower.

439
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:33,983
Speaker 1: Whoever builds the highest tower wins, but whoever has.

440
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:39,014
Speaker 1: if your tower is too high God is offended and you lose.

441
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:43,372
Speaker 1: so it's the highest tower that does not offend God from being too tall and It's like.

442
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:47,370
Speaker 1: I really like that like oh, it's a race, but you don't want to be too fast.

443
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:51,130
Speaker 1: It's a contest, but you don't want to be too strong.

444
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,990
Speaker 0: Strongest within a limit instead of a rubber band or a catch-up mechanism.

445
00:29:57,391 --> 00:30:01,707
Speaker 0: It's just a hard and punishing gate at the very end of the game.

446
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,750
Speaker 1: Yep It's like, you know, can you step on the accelerator, you know, how hard are you gonna step on it?

447
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,789
Speaker 1: Step on it as hard as you can but then hit the brakes and don't step on it too hard, right?

448
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:19,236
Speaker 1: It's like you got to push it down faster than the other guy like a game of chicken So that it breaks.

449
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,985
Speaker 0: but like that's the whole game.

450
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:21,850
Speaker 0: it's so simple.

451
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:25,910
Speaker 0: I think the only other mechanic is whoever bid the least money you get some bonus points.

452
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:29,576
Speaker 0: There's those other bonus points Once once each go-around.

453
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:34,950
Speaker 1: you want to bid zero once because you get a bonus point for bidding zero once per go-around.

454
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:42,790
Speaker 1: So like we played four players So basically on 25% of the turns I bid zero so that I can collect those bonus points.

455
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I won.

456
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:44,864
Speaker 0: you pretty much got it.

457
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,609
Speaker 1: I think I did win.

458
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,618
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I forgot to do that one round.

459
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:55,430
Speaker 1: I almost forgot to do it one round and then I remembered I Actually, I didn't know the rule until round two, but luckily I bid zero in round.

460
00:30:56,671 --> 00:31:02,430
Speaker 0: What was also fun is people who did not want to win an auction would often just write some bullshit on their cards.

461
00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:10,256
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, we basically had a rule of if there isn't a clear number on your card, then it's a zero Yep, so I would draw like a middle finger.

462
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:12,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, or a genital talia.

463
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:16,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, those things are a lot of bids of 69.

464
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:17,676
Speaker 1: I won with some bits of 69.

465
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:22,290
Speaker 1: Yeah and 420 and some other nice bids, but it was an interesting experience.

466
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:29,108
Speaker 0: Enjoyed this experience and I would play it again as a high fun factor per second of time played and it's fast.

467
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:34,210
Speaker 1: the problem I think the only negative thing about this game is that if you're looking for optimal play, right?

468
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:44,528
Speaker 1: There will be there has to be so much you could do probably like a doctoral Mathematic thesis on optimal play in this game some game theory your PhD level stuff

469
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:46,153
Speaker 0: comes down And to

470
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:48,941
Speaker 1: actually implement that

471
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:49,402
Speaker 0: math

472
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:56,210
Speaker 1: in real time as you play this game Unless you're some sort of actual genius would be impossible.

473
00:31:56,451 --> 00:32:00,189
Speaker 1: And if you did play with such a genius, it would be frustrating as hell and eliminate all the fun.

474
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:08,990
Speaker 0: Well much like Timbuktu This game would be very different if there was a player aid where you could keep track of information.

475
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:12,460
Speaker 0: Oh indeed And I would like to try playing it with that to see what happens.

476
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,890
Speaker 1: because Timbuktu that would eliminate the memory aspect Which would be fine, but but it might cause an analysis paralysis problem.

477
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think you want to.

478
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:35,830
Speaker 1: well, I don't think you have the math to like Exactly calculate your but you know, but yeah, I could use it to make some pretty intense heuristics though I think I definitely could improve Greatly, but I wouldn't bother wasting my time.

479
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:48,810
Speaker 0: Replay like exact dollar amounts, right when we replayed Timbuktu at review con without the play raid The game was very different because I could not keep all of the relevant information in my head and take my turn quickly.

480
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:55,090
Speaker 0: Nope, but with the player sheet, there's literally like the game is just like no decisions are made complete tangent.

481
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:05,549
Speaker 1: There was an article I didn't read recently But I saw the headlines and said summary that talked about some sort of people that have a condition where they basically remember almost every detail of their lives.

482
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:09,244
Speaker 1: Like I don't know how that works or if that's made up our.

483
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:13,989
Speaker 1: if true That would person would be excellent at board game.

484
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:21,272
Speaker 0: So our Scott Becker wrote a non Prince of Nothing book that is about that and what the hell it would be if you remembered Everything.

485
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:24,870
Speaker 1: but I think that said that this is like there are like 60 something people like that.

486
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,975
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's true or not.

487
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:29,390
Speaker 0: Well, if our Scott backers book is any indication it is a living hell.

488
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:36,190
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is not pleasant, but you'd be great at board games Especially memory ones like say Scrabble or Timbuktu.

489
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:47,066
Speaker 0: so before we get to yogi as an aside this game is in board game geek, of course cuz every games in there and The forum has forum threads in it like it does.

490
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:59,186
Speaker 0: I Forgot why I never look in the board game geek forum unless I'm looking for a rule Like a rule clarification because the first thread I saw is what are the industry tokens for?

491
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,670
Speaker 1: it's explaining the rules.

492
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,057
Speaker 1: Yes, I learned that right away.

493
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:06,297
Speaker 1: It's one of the first things I learned like literally Did you not read the rules?

494
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:08,628
Speaker 0: and then there's a bunch of questions about it?

495
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,886
Speaker 0: The next one what is the endgame tiebreaker, what do I do if there's a tie?

496
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:13,909
Speaker 0: we've tied in two games.

497
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:17,396
Speaker 0: and then the next post is a Quote the rule book.

498
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:20,530
Speaker 0: in the event of a draw the player with the lowest total bids is the winner.

499
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:21,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, that makes sense.

500
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:22,638
Speaker 0: Yep.

501
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,862
Speaker 1: I got a fact.

502
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:25,610
Speaker 1: that would be my first guess without the rule book.

503
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:30,869
Speaker 0: yep, and then the most fascinating thing and This one has a bunch of comments.

504
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:35,085
Speaker 0: Someone said possible variant to remove player elimination.

505
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,188
Speaker 1: What player elimination?

506
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,695
Speaker 1: Hey Player elimination.

507
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:44,806
Speaker 0: has anyone ever considered introducing a native score for the players spending the most of the end of the game rather than eliminating them from the game completely.

508
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:48,929
Speaker 0: now Two problems with this person's statement problem.

509
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:54,626
Speaker 0: The first the literal whole point the core conceit of the game.

510
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:56,170
Speaker 0: Is that elimination?

511
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:58,854
Speaker 1: Yes, also Okay, fine.

512
00:34:59,115 --> 00:35:03,407
Speaker 1: Give me some matter of negative score for being the person who bids the most.

513
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,598
Speaker 1: guess what my strategy is As close to infinity.

514
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:12,118
Speaker 0: every single round of iron to the ninth power to the ninth power I have every single power to the.

515
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:15,010
Speaker 1: I now have every single victory point in the game.

516
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,273
Speaker 1: Congratulations.

517
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:19,770
Speaker 1: What negative score are you going to give me if it isn't negative infinity?

518
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,284
Speaker 1: I now have one more victory point than all the other players and I win.

519
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:32,270
Speaker 1: actually in that strategy Lemon if a lab you want to allow people to bid any number you must eliminate the person who bids the most for it to Have any sense whatsoever?

520
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:36,110
Speaker 1: Person does not understand math or games.

521
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,126
Speaker 0: I'm sorry, but I just I kept digging through the for the discussion about this game in particular.

522
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:46,438
Speaker 0: We're really sad Yeah, and they were all like that do not?

523
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:47,059
Speaker 1: oh.

524
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,095
Speaker 0: and also people who think they have degenerative strategies who clearly just don't really Understand the game.

525
00:35:52,436 --> 00:36:04,490
Speaker 0: Maybe if maybe one of them is the PhD that I spoke of I don't know I got some ideas for not degenerate strategies But if there is a player at a table who is not particularly clever, they are a plus strategy.

526
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:12,810
Speaker 1: Well, obviously if somebody bids too high and reveals They're too high bids Then the strategy is bid as much as you can with that while bidding less than that and a big giant number.

527
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:14,349
Speaker 1: You know about yep, right?

528
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:22,929
Speaker 1: but otherwise You know if everyone's bidding sort of close to each other It's just sort of like mmm bid more on the ones that are worth more points for you.

529
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:30,270
Speaker 0: Now if you want to play this game because it was like a fancy wooden Kickstarter and I guess you could be into that if you want Why would you need a fancy wooden thing for such a simple game?

530
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:30,611
Speaker 1: You could.

531
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,160
Speaker 1: you don't need to buy anything to play this game.

532
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,830
Speaker 1: You just need some dry erase.

533
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,759
Speaker 1: You don't even need dry erase, but dry erase would be better.

534
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,950
Speaker 0: There's a play that everyone seems to play.

535
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:43,813
Speaker 1: You just need some pens some papers and you know, that's about it Pens paper.

536
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:44,315
Speaker 0: Yep.

537
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:52,110
Speaker 0: I this game impressed me enough to where we added it to the top the 40 games You should play panel at the last second because I wanted to tell them what other game is like this, right?

538
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,200
Speaker 0: Yeah bid anything go nuts.

539
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:56,310
Speaker 0: yeah offend the gods don't.

540
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,721
Speaker 0: So we played another really like game.

541
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:00,550
Speaker 0: that's basically tabletop twister, right?

542
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:10,584
Speaker 1: So I was walking around enforcing and when I walk around enforcing, you know I tend to try to chat people up and see what games they're playing and usually people playing a game that I know You know, it's like I'll just sort of ignore them.

543
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:14,830
Speaker 1: or maybe if it's a game I really know like teeny of it like a teeny Yeah.

544
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:24,400
Speaker 1: but when I'm mostly looking for games where a the people look like they're actually having fun and not just sitting there reading rules or Doing boring stuff right and to to game.

545
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,263
Speaker 1: I never seen before.

546
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:35,699
Speaker 1: so I saw some people walking around and One dude had a card like in his ear and another dude was on the card in his nose And this other gamer had like card.

547
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,184
Speaker 1: they were like they were there.

548
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:40,758
Speaker 1: hand like foot was up on the table And I'm like whatever this is.

549
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:46,198
Speaker 1: I got to know what this is and it did not disappoint No, so it was in like a tabletop library.

550
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:49,027
Speaker 1: It packs is a little tiny card game comes a little tin.

551
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:50,010
Speaker 0: It's called yogi.

552
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,450
Speaker 1: It's called yogi as in yoga as in dalsim right from Street Fighter.

553
00:37:54,932 --> 00:38:06,327
Speaker 1: It is a game where basically the cards tell you what to do and it'll say for example You'll pick up a card and it'll say make sure this card is always touching your right thumb and it's like alright.

554
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:10,168
Speaker 1: from then on That card must always touch your right thumb at all times.

555
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,755
Speaker 1: It was never going around.

556
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:16,310
Speaker 1: if at any moment that card ceases to contact your right thumb you immediately lose.

557
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:18,950
Speaker 0: I was doing real well in our first game, but I had won.

558
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,629
Speaker 0: I had to have a card touching my elbow side of my elbow down on this card.

559
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:24,152
Speaker 0: Oh Turn and turn.

560
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:31,141
Speaker 0: I kept getting all these cards and all these turns and I kept this elbow on the table and then at one Point I looked down because I forgot the card was there.

561
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,410
Speaker 0: It's been a while and I see this card on my elbow.

562
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,054
Speaker 0: I'm like, what's that?

563
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:36,327
Speaker 0: I lived in my elbow up to look at it and I was eliminated.

564
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:44,410
Speaker 1: Yep So basically all you do is keep adding cards, right and as you add more cards, you have to do all these things simultaneously.

565
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,896
Speaker 1: It's contorted.

566
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:53,181
Speaker 1: and the thing is you even have to draw the next card without breaking any of the rules while you draw the next.

567
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:58,670
Speaker 0: now the nice thing is it comes with these little trays where you can Slide the card out just by putting friction on the top of it and pulling.

568
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:01,529
Speaker 0: Yes, but that did not help as much as you expect.

569
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,144
Speaker 1: It says if you are unable to draw the next card you lose.

570
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:08,613
Speaker 1: right, you know, so That's pretty much the whole game.

571
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:18,577
Speaker 1: It's twister, but it's a little bit more accessible because you could I guess play it if you Only have arms and a torso.

572
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:21,287
Speaker 1: I don't but it wasn't too much leg action that I remember.

573
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:27,467
Speaker 0: it is also Pretty inaccessible in that many of the if you have any dexterity problems whatsoever.

574
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:31,182
Speaker 1: Yes It's not super accessible, but it's better than twister.

575
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,750
Speaker 1: It needs a lot less space than twister.

576
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:34,070
Speaker 1: It needs a lot less equipment than twist.

577
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:40,653
Speaker 0: I hurt my neck a little bit because I had to hold doesn't it now in my ear and I was I had my neck down The entire time.

578
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:43,424
Speaker 1: it doesn't involve any sexual things like twister.

579
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,990
Speaker 0: Does you know you're not touching other players?

580
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:49,505
Speaker 1: Touch other people right but it's and it's a lot actually more complex.

581
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:53,258
Speaker 1: It's not just like right foot blue It's like it's actually more detailed than that.

582
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:56,570
Speaker 1: It's like ah, this must you know be touching this in such a way.

583
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:59,517
Speaker 0: I guess what it does is Unlike say Jenga is a good example.

584
00:39:59,557 --> 00:40:03,050
Speaker 1: some of the cards aren't giving you like rules about touching the card.

585
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,180
Speaker 1: Some of them are just giving you general rules.

586
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,390
Speaker 1: left hand must always be below right hand, right?

587
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,527
Speaker 1: So now for the rest of the game your left hand has to be closer to the one I closed.

588
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:12,090
Speaker 0: cover.

589
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:14,485
Speaker 0: Never display your lower teeth.

590
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:19,590
Speaker 0: Yep That's really annoying.

591
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:25,425
Speaker 1: Yeah and if any moment you reveal someone sees your bottom teeth they call you out and you're supposed to plate.

592
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:31,910
Speaker 1: you cannot play this game with People who are jerks because the jerks will just win and make it a miserable experience.

593
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:36,350
Speaker 1: You need to play by the honor system and report yourself for violating the rules.

594
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:43,564
Speaker 1: Nobody playing this could possibly Monitor all players equally and catch them in the act of like.

595
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:48,825
Speaker 1: if I reveal my bottom teeth for a second I'm technically out but if no one saw it, it's like come on, bro, right?

596
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:49,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you can't be doing that.

597
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,982
Speaker 0: So the game is good.

598
00:40:53,303 --> 00:41:00,370
Speaker 0: compared to say like Jenga is the example I'm gonna use because Jenga is a game where it's an exterior game and you go until someone messes up and you play whatever.

599
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:06,130
Speaker 0: But the game has a lot of build up to the until you get to the point to where skill matters.

600
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:13,940
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm this game and twister actually only round one and Yogi is comfortable and it's only slightly comfortable.

601
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,046
Speaker 1: like the game ends pretty quick real I guess if people are really really good yogis you could go long.

602
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,436
Speaker 0: even then the game Fundamentally limits.

603
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:26,410
Speaker 0: I don't think you could get past seven or eight cards.

604
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:37,151
Speaker 1: I think it may be some super super dextrous person But even then and a lot of it also it depends on what cards you get because sometimes you get cards that go well with Each other.

605
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,882
Speaker 1: they don't require like the same body parts to hear.

606
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:46,955
Speaker 0: and there was one like I wear glasses So I was sticking cards in my glasses to hold him next to my ear to hold him on my eye to hold him on My nose.

607
00:41:47,136 --> 00:41:49,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, fill in my glasses with cards.

608
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,882
Speaker 1: Well some people, you know, I had a card the first time.

609
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:57,309
Speaker 1: I think I won the game or came close I don't remember but on my card sort of didn't interfere with each other.

610
00:41:57,631 --> 00:42:03,509
Speaker 1: But then the second time we played like the third or fourth card It was like foiled by like the first card I had and it's like.

611
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:05,845
Speaker 1: well I can't do both these cards at the same time.

612
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:06,569
Speaker 1: I lose.

613
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:22,368
Speaker 0: So there is a skill component but it's also a little pretty significantly random because it has the problem of all dexterity games where where there's player elimination where it goes around and Generally, whoever went first is at a disadvantage because they're drawing cards earlier, right?

614
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:33,170
Speaker 1: So I might be eliminated on my fourth card and then the next person is eliminated on their fourth card And now the only player left has only done three cards and does not need to attempt a fourth card.

615
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, because everyone else is already lost.

616
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:39,730
Speaker 0: now You could probably mitigate that by modding the game a little bit like I could imagine.

617
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:50,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, you say all right If everyone fails at a fourth card then go back to three cards and try again or you max it out at six cards And then you just you'd replace any one card with your new card something like that.

618
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,170
Speaker 0: So you could come up with something clever.

619
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:55,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the game is not particularly deep.

620
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:57,615
Speaker 0: It's not particular like this.

621
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:03,370
Speaker 0: It's just fun enough and cheap enough to where I would recommend it as a party game.

622
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,060
Speaker 0: I would reckon I would definitely.

623
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,025
Speaker 1: this is one of those games.

624
00:43:06,046 --> 00:43:10,050
Speaker 1: you're gonna buy it You're gonna play it with your people until you get bored of it And then you're gonna bust it out.

625
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:14,090
Speaker 1: Okay, and then it when there's new people you busted out again and ago.

626
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,370
Speaker 1: Oh my god, you have a super blast of time.

627
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:19,530
Speaker 0: But then I put this in my bag right next to banana grams and spot it, right?

628
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,497
Speaker 1: But then it runs out.

629
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,109
Speaker 1: I'm like spot it which can keep going.

630
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:28,814
Speaker 1: Yo runs out and it runs its course with some people after like maybe, you know half-hour Yeah, even that.

631
00:43:29,236 --> 00:43:30,842
Speaker 1: and then the other problem is there aren't?

632
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:31,504
Speaker 1: it's cheap.

633
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:32,850
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of cards in that box.

634
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:35,242
Speaker 1: You're gonna sweet real played it twice.

635
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,890
Speaker 1: We saw repeat cards.

636
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,969
Speaker 1: You're gonna see all the cards and then it's boring.

637
00:43:39,512 --> 00:43:43,750
Speaker 1: So maybe try to make your own yogi deck with more cars to the game's credit.

638
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:54,073
Speaker 0: The cards were pretty consistent in their general level of difficulty That is true and they were more complex and more difficult than I would have expected or would have even thought to design into a Similar game.

639
00:43:54,133 --> 00:44:03,097
Speaker 1: Yes, if I had to sit there and actually think of yogi cards I would not think of ones as good as the ones in actual yogi like for exact the example We used to keep left hand above right hand.

640
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:06,910
Speaker 1: elevation wise this card is touching two hands.

641
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:15,221
Speaker 0: Yep, yep two hands touching This card covering one eye not just touching cover.

642
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:17,466
Speaker 0: right thumb always pointed down.

643
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:23,770
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Oh Man, I just really you know you go crazy with if you played this game.

644
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:32,330
Speaker 0: We have a rule you can always trade a card with anyone at any time But you have to maintain all the non traded cards rules during the entirety of the trade.

645
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:36,289
Speaker 0: This game is it's like twister just play with it.

646
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:41,150
Speaker 0: It's treated more like a toy and a party game and run with it and I think it's pretty fun.

647
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,385
Speaker 1: Also, you know when you're sitting around a table and a cramped packs fully clothed.

648
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:47,032
Speaker 1: It's not the easiest I think.

649
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:57,256
Speaker 1: if you played it in like an open area like a room with lots of space nice and naked Well naked or you know wearing definitely naked more comfortable and stretchy clothes We got rid of the second.

650
00:44:57,276 --> 00:45:01,403
Speaker 1: if we wanted the naked part where she could play twister You're not touching anyone.

651
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:09,083
Speaker 0: you play yogi You know in more Trend and kickstart the erotic version of yogi.

652
00:45:09,364 --> 00:45:23,629
Speaker 1: sure if you play more custom You know and more comfortable flexible clothing in a more open space Then that would give people the advantage of being able to get more cheating to have large numbers of Bracelets and a bandana and a baseball cap?

653
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:27,102
Speaker 0: I don't know cuz I feel like I could just wear.

654
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:29,070
Speaker 1: it's fair as long as everyone is equal access.

655
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:30,857
Speaker 1: Yet you you might.

656
00:45:30,877 --> 00:45:36,070
Speaker 1: I think you might want to make a mod where you too could have bought The bracelet that I am where I think would be cool.

657
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:38,759
Speaker 1: You'd have a mod and we're before the game starts.

658
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:41,950
Speaker 1: this there's like one item per player and like what you do a draft.

659
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, one extra item and everyone drafts one item and the other items go away.

660
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,408
Speaker 1: So it's like I'll take the bandana you take the bracelet someone else takes the glasses or whatever.

661
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:50,950
Speaker 0: It's not bad.

662
00:45:51,535 --> 00:45:52,968
Speaker 0: What do you have on knife?

663
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:56,009
