1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,723
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, July 16th.

2
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:12,246
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:12,907
Speaker 2: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:14,410
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:20,480
Speaker 1: Tonight, our amazing and awesome interview with Paul Otaking Johnson.

6
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,995
Speaker 2: So I hear you've been watching some of that there.

8
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:33,660
Speaker 2: eskaflone.

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's amazing.

10
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:37,800
Speaker 1: how little of the show I remember.

11
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:40,139
Speaker 2: But you've only seen it once.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I've only seen it all the way through once in that marathon time.

13
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:47,640
Speaker 1: I never watched it again.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,379
Speaker 1: And that was years and years ago.

15
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:56,400
Speaker 1: I remember some basic things about the show, like who the major characters are, what happens at the end.

16
00:00:57,382 --> 00:01:00,299
Speaker 1: But I can really only tell you two or three sentences about what happens at the end.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,720
Speaker 1: And a few other things, which are mostly spoiler things, like the big spoiler things.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,020
Speaker 1: And I remember a couple scenes, but like I'm watching the first episode and they're like characters I don't remember.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,108
Speaker 1: Huge parts of the plot I don't remember.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,877
Speaker 1: It's like watching a brand new show.

21
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:18,720
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,240
Speaker 2: Yeah, so with this new Scott renaissance of watching anime, we'll be reviewing a lot more shows much quicker.

23
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd be surprised.

24
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:34,000
Speaker 1: It's like if you have a new piece of technology that's really fancy, it's like it sort of always makes you want to use it.

25
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,600
Speaker 1: You know, that's how you can sort of tell if you made a good technology purchase.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,500
Speaker 1: Like if you buy something and then you're always going to really want to play with it right away.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,280
Speaker 1: But sometimes you'll play with it right away and then it will just sort of sit there.

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,779
Speaker 1: And it's like, even though you might look at it and think, man, I bought that and I feel bad about not using it.

29
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:57,920
Speaker 1: If you don't sort of have this urge to want to use it, even if there's no reason to is probably a bad move.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Speaker 1: But the iPhone, man, it just makes you want to use it all the time.

31
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,820
Speaker 1: And if I want to use it all the time, I need to find something to do with it.

32
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:14,400
Speaker 1: So I'm glad about the 16 gig because I fit all of Evangelion and all of Escaflowne on there and the Evangelion director's cut episodes and there's room to spare.

33
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:22,300
Speaker 1: I can fit two entire anime series on there and I bought the cable that lets you plug it into a television or whatever.

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:29,278
Speaker 1: So now I can go to an anime convention, plug this thing into like a TV in the hotel room and boom, it's a marathon with this tiny little thing.

35
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:29,880
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

36
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:31,123
Speaker 2: You know what?

37
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:32,446
Speaker 2: You know what I really miss?

38
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:38,380
Speaker 2: When we actually would do anime marathons back at RIT when we had, I don't know, free time and no responsibility.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,484
Speaker 1: It can do YouTube, too.

40
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:42,895
Speaker 1: So I can get YouTube on any TV screen where there's a cell phone signal.

41
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:44,360
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,575
Speaker 2: But yeah, my laptop came back from the shop, so I've been watching mad anime.

43
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:50,920
Speaker 2: I'm finally watching that time.

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,078
Speaker 1: Oh, but you have to like switch DVDs out and you got...

45
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,660
Speaker 2: Well, no, because half the shows I'm watching, I happen to already have in digital form for various reasons.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,320
Speaker 1: You have to like load them up on the hard drive and you got to have this big thing on your lap.

47
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:03,804
Speaker 2: See, I don't mind the big thing.

48
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:04,588
Speaker 2: I got a big screen.

49
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,692
Speaker 2: What are you trying to do?

50
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,455
Speaker 2: Sell me an iPhone?

51
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,520
Speaker 2: I'm buying an iPhone.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,611
Speaker 1: I'm not trying to sell you an iPhone.

53
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:09,400
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to make funny.

54
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,602
Speaker 2: You know, I got no complaints.

55
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:20,160
Speaker 2: Actually, because my laptop was in the shop for like a week when I finally got it back, I was watching anime and playing Civ 4 at the same time.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,098
Speaker 2: It was like I had to use my laptop double to make up for the time I lost.

57
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,060
Speaker 1: What did you do when you didn't have the laptop when it was in the shop?

58
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,006
Speaker 2: You know what I did?

59
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:28,919
Speaker 2: I got on the train and I slept.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,440
Speaker 1: Read books maybe?

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,639
Speaker 2: Actually, yeah, I got through about half of that Byzantine Emperor's history book.

62
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,900
Speaker 2: Half of one third of that history.

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:38,716
Speaker 1: Okay.

64
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,829
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't know.

65
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,054
Speaker 2: Is there any anime news?

66
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,760
Speaker 2: It's been kind of a dry week or two.

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,620
Speaker 1: No, there hasn't been much anime news other than the general anime in the US is going down the shitter.

68
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,458
Speaker 1: So I found a little comic news here.

69
00:03:53,661 --> 00:04:00,060
Speaker 1: In shows past, you may have heard me discuss some of Boom Studios comics, the Tales series.

70
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,160
Speaker 1: You know, Zombie Tales, Cthulhu Tales, Pirate Tales.

71
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,299
Speaker 2: They seem to have been kind of hit or miss.

72
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they were anthology books.

73
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:12,460
Speaker 1: It's like, hey, anyone want to write like a five page ninja story with a twist ending?

74
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,339
Speaker 1: Send it in and we'll pick out the good ones and we'll put them all together in one book, right?

75
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,900
Speaker 1: So if you missed out on these things and didn't buy them like I did, which I now sort of feel bad about buying because they're free online.

76
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:29,039
Speaker 1: So for absolutely no money, you can go to this website that I'll link to.

77
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:38,900
Speaker 1: You can read Ninja Tales, Zombie Tales, Heroes Squared, Two Guns, ShmoBots or Cthulhu Tales or all of the above for no money.

78
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:40,717
Speaker 1: And that's it.

79
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:44,380
Speaker 1: You probably should because there's some good stuff in there.

80
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,459
Speaker 1: I haven't read all of it, so I can't speak for all of it.

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,840
Speaker 1: But there is definitely some stuff in there that is worth reading, especially for free.

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,972
Speaker 1: I mean, Cthulhu Tales for free.

83
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:55,060
Speaker 0: Why not?

84
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,099
Speaker 1: I mean, there's good stuff in there.

85
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,166
Speaker 2: So I'll keep this real brief.

86
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:02,400
Speaker 2: I'm actually going to skip on the news half because as you all, you're probably all here.

87
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,860
Speaker 2: You just want to hear the interview and we're going to try to get right to that.

88
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,760
Speaker 2: But I just want to point out, since the current sabbatical Geek Night schedule prevents us from talking every week about anime.

89
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:14,460
Speaker 2: So I figure I should mention this when I can.

90
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,620
Speaker 2: But don't forget that August 1st through 3rd at KineticCon in Hartford, Connecticut, we're doing a crazy ton of panels and events.

91
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,594
Speaker 1: I can't even name them all.

92
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,160
Speaker 1: There's so many.

93
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,006
Speaker 2: I'm not going to list them.

94
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:30,100
Speaker 2: We're pretty much going to be running programming at KineticCon all weekend.

95
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,000
Speaker 2: So if you want to see us, you should probably be there.

96
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,321
Speaker 1: Yeah.

97
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:36,760
Speaker 1: If we're not in some sort of panel, we'll be in the gaming room running mad gaming action.

98
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:47,978
Speaker 2: The weekend directly after that, Otacon in Baltimore, Maryland, we're going to be running two panels in addition to being at our front row crew area of the artist alley, which includes 11 tables.

99
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:49,510
Speaker 2: Oh man.

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,544
Speaker 2: We've got quite a posse.

101
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:57,740
Speaker 2: And the panels we're running, I can tell you now that the one of them anime you should see is actually scheduled for noon on Friday.

102
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:01,680
Speaker 1: So you got to, if you want to see us noon on Friday, you're going to have to rush into the con.

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,340
Speaker 2: Or, you know, get your badge on Thursday, like all civilized humans do.

104
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,480
Speaker 1: But you got to get into the con early Friday to get into that noon panel.

105
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,060
Speaker 2: All I have to say is I'm glad we're doing this noon panel because that means we can get into the con early and not have to deal with any of that business.

106
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,340
Speaker 1: We're going to get in early anyway.

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,680
Speaker 2: Also, I'm going to point out anything, you know, all you Otacon people, every year this happens.

108
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,180
Speaker 2: So in case any of you are thinking, go to Otacon, every year you realize that they open all the doors to the con when they open the con.

109
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:30,628
Speaker 2: And there's always a line to get in the front door.

110
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,620
Speaker 2: And that line will line up hours before Otacon opens on Friday.

111
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,172
Speaker 2: You don't need to stand in that line.

112
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:37,640
Speaker 1: They open all the other doors.

113
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

114
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,340
Speaker 1: And sometimes at the other doors, like some of the security people give you guff, right?

115
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,348
Speaker 1: You just got to be like, look, I have a badge.

116
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,332
Speaker 1: The con is open.

117
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:46,255
Speaker 1: Let me in the door.

118
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,280
Speaker 1: I can come in here.

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,308
Speaker 2: Plus they only give guff for like five minutes.

120
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:49,790
Speaker 2: Then you'll get it.

121
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,040
Speaker 2: There is no reason to stand in the line on Friday.

122
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,521
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

123
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:57,980
Speaker 1: Even though if they give guff right away and you can't convince them not to, don't go wait in the line and try to get in the front door.

124
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:05,100
Speaker 1: Just stand on the side door where there's nobody, wait a few minutes and eventually, all right, they'll let you in.

125
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:06,679
Speaker 1: And you don't have to wait in a stupid line.

126
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:07,482
Speaker 0: Yep.

127
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:11,340
Speaker 2: So then there's going to be a brief sabbatical where we go on our annual writer's retreat.

128
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:16,620
Speaker 2: And then over Labor Day weekend, we're going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo where we're going to be doing yet another panel.

129
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,220
Speaker 2: And then in September, in fact, let me pull up the date here because it's a little ways off.

130
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:30,280
Speaker 2: But yeah, September 27th in the Javitch Center, New York City at the New York Anime Festival, we're going to be doing four panels.

131
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,960
Speaker 2: And let me tell you, one of these panels.

132
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:35,096
Speaker 2: 27th.

133
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:35,480
Speaker 1: Okay.

134
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,889
Speaker 2: These are some pretty epic panels we're going to be running.

135
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:40,280
Speaker 2: New York Anime Festival is always fun, at least for one day.

136
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:47,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, that Pennsylvania thing we may or may not do is on September 6th and 7th, the week after.

137
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,325
Speaker 2: Good God.

138
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:49,539
Speaker 1: So we're basically going to be going to town.

139
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,859
Speaker 1: Do you want to do that?

140
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:51,437
Speaker 2: Yes.

141
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,549
Speaker 2: Yes.

142
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,012
Speaker 1: You do?

143
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,300
Speaker 2: But at the same time, I don't know if I can.

144
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:58,200
Speaker 1: We'll come back from PAX Monday, go to the convention Saturday and Sunday.

145
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:58,857
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

146
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,217
Speaker 1: In Pennsylvania.

147
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,179
Speaker 2: Plus there's that, I don't even know what we're going to do.

148
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:03,859
Speaker 1: Yeah.

149
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,339
Speaker 2: At least the New York Comic-Con is a ways off.

150
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,119
Speaker 2: And Katsu-Con is a ways off.

151
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Speaker 2: Though, for anyone who's excited about Katsu-Con, one, we've already got a large list of panels ready for Katsu-Con.

152
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,520
Speaker 2: But two, the staff is conducting their hotel walkthroughs because, as you know, Katsu-Con has moved to Crystal City.

153
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,700
Speaker 2: Well, back to Crystal City from where it was last year.

154
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,927
Speaker 1: Which is not in Washington,

155
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:26,330
Speaker 1: D.C.,

156
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:27,700
Speaker 1: like I said.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,520
Speaker 2: But at the same time, it is not its own city, Scott.

158
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,158
Speaker 2: It is in Virginia, right next to Washington, D.C.

159
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,225
Speaker 1: It's a city.

160
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:34,929
Speaker 1: It's Crystal City.

161
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:36,519
Speaker 1: It's a place called Crystal City.

162
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,120
Speaker 2: Crystal City is a mall.

163
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,719
Speaker 2: Anyway, Katsu-Con is going to be pretty rockin'.

164
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 2: And the staff's doing their walkthrough to figure out how to set everything up now that Katsu-Con's kind of gotten big.

165
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a medium to large con.

166
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,080
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not Otacon big, but it's not, you know, Kineticon small.

167
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,980
Speaker 2: Plus, you know, Kineticon is an awesome anime con.

168
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:02,980
Speaker 2: But at the same time, Kineticon's tabletop gaming content is better than most tabletop gaming cons by itself.

169
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,799
Speaker 1: I think that's just because of the high quality of the game room staff.

170
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:10,700
Speaker 2: Which this year will include, actually, a good portion of the gaming side of the front row crew.

171
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,998
Speaker 1: Maybe like two or three people.

172
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:13,980
Speaker 2: Actually, it might be up to four or five now.

173
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,144
Speaker 2: Oh, man.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,657
Speaker 2: But they'll all be running demos of all the games all weekend.

175
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:18,160
Speaker 1: It'll be awesome.

176
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:20,680
Speaker 2: Burning Wheel, board games, awesomeness.

177
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,000
Speaker 2: But Katsu-Con is the same way with old school arcade games.

178
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,900
Speaker 2: The classic gaming room at Katsu-Con is so great.

179
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:29,759
Speaker 1: It is top notch.

180
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,500
Speaker 2: But anyway, we're going to move right along with this because I'm sure you're all excited to hear this interview.

181
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:45,590
Speaker 2: So anyway, before we get on to the interview, that music means it's time for Things of the Day.

182
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,370
Speaker 2: I explain only because I'm sure there's a lot of people who normally might not listen to Geek Nights who are here to hear this interview.

183
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:52,469
Speaker 1: I hope so.

184
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,730
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know how popular this particular interview is going to be.

185
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,388
Speaker 1: I mean, he's only, he had 15 minutes of internet fame.

186
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,109
Speaker 2: Even though he should have more because he's an awesome guy.

187
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,470
Speaker 1: The entire anime community needs to know about it.

188
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,390
Speaker 1: The thing is, he was all, like, when I emailed him asking for an interview, he was all shy.

189
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:09,581
Speaker 0: Like, oh, I don't know.

190
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:10,045
Speaker 1: I don't know.

191
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:13,929
Speaker 1: He was like one of the best interview people we've had on.

192
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,060
Speaker 2: He was just spot on.

193
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,050
Speaker 2: I hardly had to edit at all.

194
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,889
Speaker 2: Most of the editing was editing me.

195
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:18,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, right?

196
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,390
Speaker 1: So let's hear what kind of Thing of the Day you got over there.

197
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:24,530
Speaker 2: Alright, well my Thing of the Day is actually Otacon related.

198
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:29,390
Speaker 2: So I used to love anime con dances when I went to a lot of cons early on.

199
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,890
Speaker 2: I'd dance everywhere and the best dance I ever went to was Katsu-Con.

200
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,230
Speaker 2: I think it was three years ago now because on Friday night, they basically played 80s music.

201
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:40,770
Speaker 2: Instead of the normal fair at anime cons.

202
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:49,436
Speaker 2: And as a result, there was only people... So there was nothing but people.

203
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:54,170
Speaker 2: my age, our age, dancing to the music we remember from our childhood.

204
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,190
Speaker 2: And it was totally awesome and non-smelly and just great.

205
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:06,690
Speaker 2: But the thing is, in general, Katsu-Con tends to have some of the best con dances because they... Instead of just playing, like, I mean there are a lot of different kinds of electronic music.

206
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,510
Speaker 2: And you can like or not like all the different kinds.

207
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,670
Speaker 2: But when every anime con degenerates into the most minimalist, boring techno in the world.

208
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:18,190
Speaker 2: Like, it's so just duh-duh-duh and there's nothing else there.

209
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,090
Speaker 1: I think part of it is, you know, the acoustics of the room, you can't hear the other parts.

210
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,869
Speaker 1: You know, the crowd of smelly people, the glow sticks.

211
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,850
Speaker 2: Well see, that's the other thing.

212
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,790
Speaker 1: The whole thing going on just doesn't work.

213
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,390
Speaker 2: But not every con has that culture.

214
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,210
Speaker 1: Not every con.

215
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:37,970
Speaker 2: The only thing I've ever had bad to say about Otakon is that their rave is terrible if you actually like dancing or music.

216
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it has nothing to do with the DJ selection.

217
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,506
Speaker 1: It has nothing to do with Otakon themselves.

218
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,029
Speaker 2: At the same time, I don't want to disparage the DJs.

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:54,470
Speaker 2: But a lot of people have been telling me that they mostly draw DJs from kind of the DJ scene in the Baltimore/DC area.

220
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:59,730
Speaker 2: And the kind of music at Otakon apparently is very representative of the club scene down there.

221
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:06,850
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's really, they have a dance, I guess sort of because they're semi obligated to in a way.

222
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,381
Speaker 1: Because I guess they're supposed to.

223
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:09,430
Speaker 1: I don't know what the deal is.

224
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,970
Speaker 1: But it's really not related to anime in any way.

225
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,610
Speaker 1: It's not an anime dance so much.

226
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,690
Speaker 1: But they get one or two, a handful of guys every year that actually do some anime musics and such.

227
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,010
Speaker 1: And that's where the action is really.

228
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,510
Speaker 2: But even then, it's really hard to find out when and there's usually not that much.

229
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:32,150
Speaker 1: And it's really crowded and smelly even if you get good dancing going on.

230
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,730
Speaker 2: Well the thing is, if you really want a good con dance, I'm going to tell you, you want to go to Katsucon.

231
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,689
Speaker 2: They have some of the best con dances out there.

232
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,450
Speaker 2: But if you want to risk the Otakon dance, because while it's smelly and loud, a lot of dancers are like that.

233
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,369
Speaker 2: A lot of clubs are like that.

234
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:56,690
Speaker 2: But a DJ posted in our forums, who listens to Geek Nights, to point out that he's going to be Friday night in the side room from 10.30 to midnight at Otakon.

235
00:12:57,272 --> 00:13:01,890
Speaker 2: He is not going to be playing the standard kind of DC Baltimore Otakon Fair.

236
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,750
Speaker 2: He's going to be playing danceable anime music and just kind of awesome stuff.

237
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:08,329
Speaker 1: Alright, mad props to that guy.

238
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,990
Speaker 2: I will tell you this, I will be there.

239
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:11,930
Speaker 1: Oh, you will.

240
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:12,424
Speaker 1: I will.

241
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:20,270
Speaker 1: See, even if he was the most awesome anime DJ in the world, I would still send him all the props that I have available in my prop basket.

242
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:25,987
Speaker 1: But at the same time, there's nothing that's going to get me to go into the crowded, smelly room.

243
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,310
Speaker 2: See, the thing is, I really like dancing.

244
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,668
Speaker 2: And the only reason I don't go...

245
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,850
Speaker 1: Do I not really like dancing?

246
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,410
Speaker 2: I do dance at Katsucon.

247
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,866
Speaker 2: I didn't last year because we did like 10 panels.

248
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:37,369
Speaker 0: I was ill.

249
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,810
Speaker 2: You were ill and I was wrecked.

250
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,850
Speaker 2: But every other Katsucon, I always spend a lot of time at the rave because I like that sort of thing.

251
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,330
Speaker 2: But Otakon's been missing it for me for the last five years.

252
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:54,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's only really, it's just the crowd and the smell, which is not the fault of... I guess it's someone's fault, but I don't know who.

253
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,630
Speaker 2: Honestly, for me it's the music and the fact that most of the people there aren't actually dancing.

254
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,950
Speaker 2: They're kind of standing in a big circle.

255
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,510
Speaker 1: Well, that's part of the crowd.

256
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,390
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is, I feel like you can direct the crowd with the music.

257
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,370
Speaker 1: Partially, that's the idea.

258
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:06,972
Speaker 2: I think you can.

259
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:10,269
Speaker 2: Also, you have to have ringers, like we used to when we ran the club dances at RIT.

260
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,170
Speaker 2: Who, if people form a circle, you have ringers that are in the DJ's pocket who go in dancing and bust the circle up.

261
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:17,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good too.

262
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,927
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Friday night, side room, 1030 to midnight.

263
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,705
Speaker 2: Check this guy out and I will be there dancing.

264
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:24,630
Speaker 2: Don't let us down, dude.

265
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:25,436
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

266
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:27,990
Speaker 2: So, do you have anything?

267
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,121
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, right.

268
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:29,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, thank you today.

269
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:38,410
Speaker 1: So, if you had to pick a top five newspaper strip cartoonist of all time.

270
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,470
Speaker 1: Calvin Hobbs.

271
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,017
Speaker 1: There you go.

272
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:40,503
Speaker 1: You're done.

273
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:41,030
Speaker 1: You're done.

274
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,909
Speaker 1: Bloom County.

275
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,259
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

276
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,369
Speaker 1: So, Bill Watterson, right?

277
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,510
Speaker 1: What is Bill Watterson known for besides Calvin and Hobbs?

278
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,688
Speaker 2: Being a recluse.

279
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,748
Speaker 1: But what else?

280
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,870
Speaker 1: Being a hermit.

281
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:51,588
Speaker 1: What are the comics?

282
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,710
Speaker 2: Calvin and Hobbs, the sequel.

283
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,763
Speaker 1: You think he just woke up one day and it was boom, Calvin and Hobbs.

284
00:14:57,803 --> 00:14:59,150
Speaker 1: He never drew anything else in his life?

285
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,693
Speaker 2: You know what?

286
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,050
Speaker 2: I'll admit that I know almost nothing about him.

287
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,430
Speaker 2: Yeah.

288
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:03,675
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

289
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,521
Speaker 1: I found a website.

290
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:08,110
Speaker 1: It is something, something, whatever.

291
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,450
Speaker 1: But at the top of the website, it says Rare Bill Watterson Art.

292
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:19,070
Speaker 1: You see, while a student at Ohio's Kenyon College, he drew cartoons to the school newspaper and the yearbook.

293
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:21,069
Speaker 1: And they're on his website.

294
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,290
Speaker 1: And in '81, he was a political cartoonist.

295
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,729
Speaker 2: So, when we weren't even born yet.

296
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,132
Speaker 1: Right.

297
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,608
Speaker 1: And some of these cartoons are here.

298
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,691
Speaker 1: His two political art cartoons, he drew at the Cincinnati Post in 1980.

299
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:42,110
Speaker 1: And his nicely painted sketch was drawn and painted in the early '86, which is Calvin and Hobbs related.

300
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:50,410
Speaker 1: So, yeah, there's a whole bunch of rare and sort of you're not going to see it anywhere else Calvin and Hobbs art on a website.

301
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,482
Speaker 1: So, you can easily see it.

302
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:54,370
Speaker 1: Which is exactly how it's supposed to be.

303
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,490
Speaker 2: That is pretty awesome because you know that feeling where there's like an amount of a certain kind of media.

304
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,310
Speaker 1: Like imagine if you saw like something that wasn't Calvin and Hobbs, right?

305
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,170
Speaker 1: Like on a table at a comic show and it said Bill Watterson on it.

306
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,569
Speaker 1: Like holy shit.

307
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:07,348
Speaker 1: What's that?

308
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,909
Speaker 1: But here it is on a website and there's a lot of it.

309
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,289
Speaker 1: So, holy shit times a bunch.

310
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,210
Speaker 2: Alright, so without further ado, the moment you've been waiting for.

311
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,730
Speaker 2: Here is the interview we conducted with the Ota King.

312
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,330
Speaker 1: Yes, Paul Ota King Johnson.

313
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,470
Speaker 2: So, this was recorded before the show.

314
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,310
Speaker 2: This isn't live like the rest of this.

315
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,290
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, because it's so live with our recorded podcast.

316
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,070
Speaker 2: Well, live in that, you know, we record live.

317
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,718
Speaker 2: We don't really edit.

318
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:33,590
Speaker 2: We just kind of throw it up.

319
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, we recorded it on Saturday, but right now I'm speaking on Wednesday.

320
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,430
Speaker 2: Yes, so enjoy this interview.

321
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,489
Speaker 2: Follow up in the forums.

322
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:43,730
Speaker 2: If you have any follow up questions, post them in the forum.

323
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,890
Speaker 2: I know that our forums are awesome by the way and you should probably join them.

324
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:50,410
Speaker 2: And we'll try to get some follow up answers because the guy's totally awesome.

325
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,230
Speaker 1: I'm also putting a link to a BitTorrent of his documentary.

326
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,410
Speaker 2: Yes, if you have not seen the Ota Kings fan sub documentary.

327
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:01,229
Speaker 2: I highly, highly recommend it.

328
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:13,130
Speaker 1: Alright, so tonight we have with us the famous, or perhaps infamous now, Paul Johnson, the Ota King, creator of the fan sub documentary.

329
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,848
Speaker 1: How you doing Paul?

330
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:15,763
Speaker 0: I'm not doing too bad.

331
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,329
Speaker 0: How are you doing?

332
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,147
Speaker 1: We're doing pretty great over here.

333
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:27,770
Speaker 1: Alright, so, I guess to start off, you made this documentary that has gotten a lot of attention in the anime community.

334
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:36,130
Speaker 1: What exactly, you know, was there some sort of spark that really sort of created your intention to do this?

335
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,490
Speaker 2: Like one fan sub that just went too far.

336
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,408
Speaker 2: What was the moment when you said "I must do this"?

337
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,950
Speaker 0: It's been simmering for a while, for about the past two years.

338
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:57,350
Speaker 0: But a couple of months ago I went downstairs and my housemate was watching Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei and the subs, the subs were so bad.

339
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,470
Speaker 0: Oh my shit, the subs were bad.

340
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,570
Speaker 0: They're actually the ones that I used on the video.

341
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw them in there, yeah.

342
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ones that basically just fill the entire screen and you can't see a single thing.

343
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,323
Speaker 0: And I was like "Oh, that's it.

344
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:18,036
Speaker 0: I'm just going to have to, I'm either going to explode or I'm going to have to spend ages and make a

345
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:18,684
Speaker 0: documentary.".

346
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,089
Speaker 0: Well, it's not really a documentary, is it?

347
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:23,688
Speaker 0: It's a rant, it's just a rant.

348
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,250
Speaker 1: Well, but I mean it is, technically speaking, it is a film in documentary form.

349
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:34,450
Speaker 2: And it has a leg up on a lot of rants in that you actually cited sources and provided examples?

350
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of like a Michael Moore piece, but with a kind of little bit of research in there, maybe.

351
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:47,229
Speaker 0: I did cite some sources, yeah.

352
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,476
Speaker 0: Yeah,

353
00:18:48,516 --> 00:19:06,550
Speaker 1: that was one thing that really struck me about the video, and I guess what makes it so good is that you really only have like maybe five points to make, and they're all really good points and really solid, but you just show so many examples over and over again to hammer down every single point.

354
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,189
Speaker 0: And I scream the points louder and louder as I go along.

355
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,387
Speaker 0: It sounded more and more insane as I go, so yeah.

356
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,609
Speaker 0: I don't think a lot of people like that.

357
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:23,590
Speaker 0: I mean, it had the narrator select scene at the start, and I think most people would have picked Starscream if they could.

358
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,750
Speaker 1: I also would have said Starscream was a good choice, but Hagar is no slouch.

359
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,329
Speaker 0: Oh, no, the mayor, the mayor, he did a good job.

360
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,361
Speaker 1: No, so speaking of that select screen at the beginning and also the thing at the end, you made those, right?

361
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:44,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I'm an amateur animator.

362
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,445
Speaker 0: I don't get paid for it.

363
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:55,630
Speaker 0: I mean, I make all my work from freelance translation, but in my free time I do do some animation and some drawing and whatnot, and you can see a lot of my artwork online.

364
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, that animation isn't bad.

365
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,149
Speaker 1: I mean, that's pretty good stuff there for not getting paid for it.

366
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:15,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it took a long while, but I figured that if you're going to do something, you may as well put in a bit of effort, and hopefully it will get people's attention more if they think, "Well, he's actually put a bit of effort into

367
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:15,164
Speaker 0: it.".

368
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:18,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was sort of surprising because I saw it.

369
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:23,190
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Obviously that's something that someone made just for this video,".

370
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:28,424
Speaker 1: but I was like, "If this guy is a professional translator, he's also that good an animator, that's pretty

371
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:28,866
Speaker 1: impressive.".

372
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,330
Speaker 0: Oh, thank you very much.

373
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,366
Speaker 1: Because I was like, "Oh, did he get someone else to do

374
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:33,628
Speaker 1: that?".

375
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:38,869
Speaker 1: Because you don't expect someone to have the great level of skill in multiple areas like that.

376
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:46,289
Speaker 0: I wanted to get some voice actor to voice act me and make me sound really cool, but then I thought in the end, "No, no.

377
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:51,503
Speaker 0: If I'm going to say all this stuff, then I may as well take the flack and use my own annoying

378
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:51,784
Speaker 0: voice.".

379
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:58,330
Speaker 0: And a lot of the comments I got were, "Fuck, this guy's voice is just so fucking annoying.

380
00:20:58,872 --> 00:21:00,469
Speaker 0: I'm just going to have to turn it

381
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:00,590
Speaker 0: off.".

382
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,363
Speaker 0: And I mean, it's true.

383
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:04,030
Speaker 0: It's true.

384
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:05,189
Speaker 0: So I'll give him that.

385
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,910
Speaker 0: I'll concede that point, but that's the only one I will concede.

386
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:18,147
Speaker 2: So before we get right into the actual documentary or piece, it seems pretty obvious that you're an anime fan of some stripe, so tell us a little bit about that.

387
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:40,386
Speaker 0: Right, basically, I got into anime back in the early '90s with, I don't know how it was in the US, but in the UK, no one knew what anime was until a company called Manga Entertainment came out and they started bringing anime over, and they started with Akira, which was, well, a pretty good start, really, if you think about it.

388
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,050
Speaker 0: And yeah, we didn't know what anime was over here.

389
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,510
Speaker 0: We definitely didn't see any of it on TV or anything.

390
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,910
Speaker 0: And then BBC2 showed Akira really late at night one night, and I heard something about it from some friends.

391
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,547
Speaker 0: I heard it was an animation, but it wasn't like Disney at all, so I'd better have a look at it.

392
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:04,468
Speaker 0: And so I watched it, and I was writhing around on the ground frothing at the mouth there how good it was.

393
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:09,029
Speaker 0: And pretty much after that, I bought everything that Manga Video released.

394
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,390
Speaker 1: Even the Manga Video holy trinity of suck?

395
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:16,021
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

396
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:16,970
Speaker 0: That's the thing, though.

397
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:24,070
Speaker 0: A lot of people slag them off, perhaps with validity about some of their really, really bad releases.

398
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,850
Speaker 0: But when they started off, if you look at the catalogue that Manga had when they started to release stuff right at the start, it was just gold.

399
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:32,669
Speaker 0: Like, every title was just gold.

400
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:41,110
Speaker 0: I mean, we had stuff like Fist of the North Star coming out and Vampire Hunter D and Cyber City, and just everything was good.

401
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,690
Speaker 0: It's just when they ran out of good titles to release, that's when things started getting a bit pear-shaped, I think.

402
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:54,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, weren't there actually-- I don't know, was this some other country, but there were laws about preventing anime from being imported to the UK?

403
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,989
Speaker 1: Or was that somewhere else?

404
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,130
Speaker 0: I'm not sure about that.

405
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,490
Speaker 0: I haven't heard anything about that.

406
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:06,470
Speaker 0: There were a lot of movements in the UK, in newspapers and whatnot, when Urotikidoji came out.

407
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:07,748
Speaker 2: I was about to bring that up.

408
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:09,658
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah.

409
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:14,729
Speaker 0: It's all just animated porn, and there's tentacles everywhere, and, you know, if you watch this, you're going to hell.

410
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:20,729
Speaker 0: But they ignored stuff like, you know, Ghibli stuff like My Neighbor Totoro and stuff like that.

411
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,230
Speaker 0: It's just journalism, I guess.

412
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:34,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, we also had Manga Video in the US, but we also, around the '90s, we had, you know, that stuff and some other stuff, like from Viz and such, was on the sci-fi channel.

413
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:36,270
Speaker 1: So that's how a lot of-- Right, of course.

414
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:46,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, it took us a lot longer to actually-- Well, I think, to my knowledge, it took us a lot longer to actually get some of the stuff on TV and get it out there a bit more.

415
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:57,950
Speaker 0: But, oh, yeah, I remember watching Fist of the North Star, the movie, and I just couldn't believe that I was actually seeing blood in what I thought was a cartoon, and the art was amazing.

416
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:04,009
Speaker 0: And, I mean, it's not every day you're going to get to see a guy walking through a skyscraper and breaking it in half with his head.

417
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:08,570
Speaker 0: This stuff was fucking cool, was what I thought at the time.

418
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, that's how they advertised anime at first.

419
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:22,950
Speaker 1: Like, when we would watch the sci-fi channel in those days, they'd be like, "Anime, it's totally violent and hardcore," and whatever, but, you know, that's-- You know, then we learned later that that's not really all that anime is about.

420
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:24,509
Speaker 0: That's not all it is, no.

421
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,609
Speaker 0: But they do it incredibly well, though.

422
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,669
Speaker 1: They sure do.

423
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,267
Speaker 1: So, what anime are like you watching lately that you're a big fan of?

424
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:38,310
Speaker 0: Right, the thing is, there's-- I've got a DeviantArt site as well.

425
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,610
Speaker 0: I know it's not especially-- You're going to have to use that cool filter here.

426
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,849
Speaker 0: I can't think of anything to say.

427
00:24:44,790 --> 00:25:10,648
Speaker 0: I know DeviantArt isn't exactly held up as, like, the holy grail of amazing art sites where all the artists are, but I've got some pieces on there about how I hate modern anime artwork and how, compared to the '80s and '90s, anime art has just got so bad, and you just don't notice until you see examples side by side, and so, basically, a lot of modern anime hurts my eyes so bad, I just can't watch it.

428
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,030
Speaker 2: Well, there's got to be a couple of things that are worthwhile.

429
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:30,129
Speaker 1: I agree with you, you know, for the most part, is, like, you know, I download-- Like, I download episode one of, like, every fan sub, even if it's a bad moe show, you know, just to see what it is, and, you know, 90% of them are absolutely dreadful, but, you know, there's still some good ones out there.

430
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:32,249
Speaker 0: It's the gray that I don't get.

431
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,449
Speaker 0: I mean, anime used to have color, and now everything's just gray, and that just really pisses me off.

432
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:48,210
Speaker 0: The first thing you learn in art school is that if you've got a skin tone and you want to add some shading to it, you don't just add black to it because that makes it look gray.

433
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:54,948
Speaker 0: I mean, you have to add, like, some yellow ochre in and some, like, alizarin crimson and all these various other colors.

434
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,010
Speaker 0: You don't just add black, but that's what anime does now because it's all done on Photoshop or whatever.

435
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:12,129
Speaker 0: You just select an area, add a bit of black, and there's your shading, and it just looks totally different in style to how it used to when they used to actually use color and mix palettes together, and it's a real shame, I think.

436
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,050
Speaker 0: But, I mean, yeah, I do watch some modern anime.

437
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:33,310
Speaker 0: I mean, the Zetsubou Sensei subtitles that I showed were really bad, but some people did say to me, you know, that they're the worst ones we've ever seen, and if you watch some better ones, like these ones here, you might enjoy it, and so my housemate is forcing me to watch it at the moment, and it is pretty funny.

438
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,449
Speaker 0: With decent subs, it is pretty funny, I think.

439
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:53,730
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, not every, you know, while I do think the vast majority of subtitles I see show at least some of the characteristics that you, you know, put down in your video, that there are still some subtitlers out there that are pretty good, like, you know, especially the ones that are subtitling older shows.

440
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,809
Speaker 0: Oh, Anime Classic, yeah.

441
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,550
Speaker 0: I've got respect for them, a lot of respect.

442
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,570
Speaker 0: They just seem, it's, you watch it, and it's just like you're watching an early '90s fansub.

443
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:16,690
Speaker 0: I mean, the font is just yellow and easy to read, and there's no karaoke bullshit at the top of the screen, and there's no names of the translators filling the screen, like, more important than the people who actually made the show or anything.

444
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:29,869
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm watching, like, all the, whoever, I don't know who's doing it because I don't really pay attention to who the fansubbers are, but I'm watching, like, all the Galaxy Express 3.9 TV episodes, whoever's doing those, and they're, you know, they're doing a perfectly normal job.

445
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:34,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really want to see that, actually, but there's so much of it that I've put it off.

446
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,550
Speaker 0: There's Legend of the Galactic Heroes as well.

447
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:48,130
Speaker 0: My other housemate, who's just gone to work for Nintendo, he was downloading and watching that before he left, but there's hundreds of episodes, and I just don't know where I can start.

448
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,330
Speaker 2: Just Habsburgs killing each other in space.

449
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,810
Speaker 0: I know, yeah, it's meant to be incredible.

450
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:53,768
Speaker 0: Have you seen it, then?

451
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,270
Speaker 2: I've seen a little bit, and our friend Scott Johnson keeps trying to push on to us.

452
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:03,624
Speaker 2: He's got, like, this 26-gigabyte collection of all of it, and he's about halfway through, and I want to, but...

453
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:08,749
Speaker 0: But, yeah, yeah, that's meant to be great, so I really want to have a look at that.

454
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:16,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am going to start watching more anime soon, now that I've got the iPhone, because I can just convert videos to the iPhone format and then watch them, you know, around.

455
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,644
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.

456
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:26,770
Speaker 2: So, if you're not watching, you know, super new anime, for the reasons you brought up, what was the last good anime?

457
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,229
Speaker 2: Like, what were some of the shows that you did like, up until things started to change?

458
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,649
Speaker 0: Well, actually, I did watch Black Lagoon, and I did like it.

459
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:36,368
Speaker 0: And, I mean, that's new.

460
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:37,969
Speaker 0: I did quite like it.

461
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:51,090
Speaker 0: It's by Madhouse, and Madhouse are a sticky subject with me, and, I mean, a lot of my favorite shows in the '90s were by Madhouse -- Cyber City, Ninja Scroll, Monster City, all that kind of stuff, and they were known for their artwork.

462
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,449
Speaker 0: I mean, they were artwork gods.

463
00:28:53,070 --> 00:29:01,350
Speaker 0: They were artwork gods, Madhouse were, but now it's just, hmm, you compare their artwork now to how they used to look, and it's just terrible.

464
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,690
Speaker 0: But I remember that Black Lagoon actually looked pretty good for modern anime.

465
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,489
Speaker 0: It looked pretty good, and the story was quite good, so I did enjoy that.

466
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:26,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think at Madhouse, it seems to me like they have multiple teams, and some of the teams are good, and some of the teams are bad, 'cause, you know, it's like the same company will, you know, do Paprika, but then they'll also do, you know, a lot of other stuff, like, you know, some crap moe show that's like, "This is also Madhouse?

467
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:26,858
Speaker 1: How can this

468
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,140
Speaker 1: be?".

469
00:29:29,311 --> 00:30:01,590
Speaker 0: But, yeah, mainly it is the artwork that stops me -- well, obviously, it's the fan subs, but if the fan subs aren't an option, and, you know, I'm actually watching proper DVD subtitles, then I'm still having trouble with modern anime because the artwork is just not detailed enough, and yet it still costs as much to buy a DVD with a few episodes on as it would have done back in the day, except you used to get incredible artwork and animation and story, and now you might get good story and animation, but you're just not gonna get any detail.

470
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:05,410
Speaker 0: And so you're getting less for your money, I think, is the trouble.

471
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,091
Speaker 1: Well, in the

472
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:06,554
Speaker 1: U.S.,

473
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:12,229
Speaker 1: actually, the official, you know, legal anime industry is sort of on a downturn, you know.

474
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,739
Speaker 1: Companies are going out.

475
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:17,830
Speaker 1: You know, ADV, you know, the long, you know, like, king of anime in the U.S.

476
00:30:17,971 --> 00:30:19,170
Speaker 1: is sort of having big trouble.

477
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:32,390
Speaker 1: But so lately, what's happening is a lot of more shows are being released in, like, these really budget slim packs, where you'll get, you know, a whole bunch of discs in, like, you know, just the box, and it's, like, 40 bucks for a whole show.

478
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:34,089
Speaker 1: Is that happening over there, too?

479
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:37,209
Speaker 0: Um, I don't think so.

480
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:42,010
Speaker 0: I'm not really seeing that much anime around on the shelves here these days.

481
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,529
Speaker 1: So maybe they just cut you out entirely.

482
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,023
Speaker 0: But everyone just uses eBay or whatever and just grabs it from the U.S.

483
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:48,670
Speaker 0: anyway, I guess.

484
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,710
Speaker 0: I mean, with your region free, you can just watch it however you like.

485
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,756
Speaker 0: And everything comes out in the U.S.

486
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:58,810
Speaker 0: first anyway, so why not, basically?

487
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:02,830
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the documentary you made here.

488
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:11,050
Speaker 1: It really feels to me like the argument that you're presenting, that, you know, the anime fan subs we have now are pretty bad.

489
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,170
Speaker 1: It feels like an extension of the old, you know, dub and sub debate.

490
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:28,590
Speaker 1: And, like, back in the day, we would argue, you know, oh, you have to stick with subtitles instead of dubs because subtitles are, you know, they're more like the original experience the Japanese people had.

491
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,070
Speaker 0: They're keeping it real, yeah.

492
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:37,049
Speaker 1: And now it seems like, you know, an attempt to keep it more real, the subtitles go off the hook.

493
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:46,830
Speaker 0: Well, they're keeping it real to the very definition of real by not translating anything at all and just leaving it in Japanese.

494
00:31:47,730 --> 00:32:02,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, you know, to take the argument that you make to the extreme, then, you know, shouldn't we just do dubs because then we'll even be closer to the Japanese experience because, you know, of hearing, you know, instead of reading the dialogue?

495
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:06,070
Speaker 0: Right, that's an interesting one, actually.

496
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,310
Speaker 0: I was talking to my friend Ben, who's another translator.

497
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:11,390
Speaker 0: Well, I'm quite jealous of him.

498
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,750
Speaker 0: He's had some much better projects than I have in the gaming world.

499
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:28,564
Speaker 0: But what he was saying was that if they were done like really, really, really well, like incredibly well, then dubs would be preferable to subs because anime is an animated medium.

500
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:34,230
Speaker 0: and to read subs, even if you're a fast reader like I am, you have to take your eyes off the screen for maybe half a second.

501
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,830
Speaker 0: And so dubs theoretically are the best way to go if they were done right.

502
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:46,208
Speaker 0: But I mean, as I'm sure you've noticed living in America, dubs are just shit.

503
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,636
Speaker 0: It's the trouble.

504
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,430
Speaker 1: They're really, really bad.

505
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:50,610
Speaker 2: Some, there's like one.

506
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like maybe five to ten good dubs I've seen.

507
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,288
Speaker 2: Well, I'm curious.

508
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,650
Speaker 2: I mean, are there any dubs that you've seen that actually were good that you would remember?

509
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:05,121
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, when I say dubs this year, I mean modern dubs, like stuff on TV like Beyblade.

510
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,269
Speaker 0: and oh, Beyblade's fucking good.

511
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:09,729
Speaker 1: My show's not even good, so it's not much of a loss.

512
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,449
Speaker 0: Beyblade makes me laugh so much.

513
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:18,650
Speaker 0: But no, some of the streamlined dubs I remember were very, very good indeed.

514
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:28,410
Speaker 0: And Fist of the North Star, I love the Japanese Fist of the North Star, but I remember manga released the streamlined dub of it and the voice acting was fantastic.

515
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:36,910
Speaker 0: Obviously, the problem is that they actually changed the story and they took out all of the science and all of the things behind it.

516
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:47,670
Speaker 0: So people's heads were exploding for no reason in the dub, whereas in the Japanese one, he was saying like, oh, I've hit you in these several pressure points and it means that your body's going to contort and explode in three seconds.

517
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:51,369
Speaker 0: But in the English one, people just blew up, which I thought was cool.

518
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:53,390
Speaker 0: So that was all right.

519
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,010
Speaker 0: But yeah, in terms of dub, it was actually really, really good.

520
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,590
Speaker 0: And a lot of manga's early dubs were fantastic as well.

521
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:08,129
Speaker 0: I mean, Cyber City is just filled with swearing, which is exactly-- you listen to the Japanese one, and I mean, these are hardened criminals.

522
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:15,130
Speaker 0: These are hardened criminals who have been in jail and they've been given a chance to get out by capturing criminals themselves.

523
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:22,504
Speaker 0: And so obviously in the dub, they just swear all the time because they've been in prison and they're just going to be swearing their heads off.

524
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,510
Speaker 0: But in Japanese, the trouble is you can't really do swearing that well.

525
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:33,230
Speaker 0: And that's another thing that I mean by keeping it to the Japanese.

526
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,190
Speaker 0: You're missing out on a lot of the things that English can offer, like in insults especially.

527
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,630
Speaker 0: English has such a richer range of insults than Japanese ever will have.

528
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:53,161
Speaker 0: And just by writing "chikusho" or "shimata," which is what everybody says when anything goes wrong in Japanese, you're just missing out.

529
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:53,889
Speaker 0: You're missing out.

530
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,527
Speaker 0: You really are, I think.

531
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:05,919
Speaker 1: Well, that is one criticism people often bring up about a lot of those older dubs, is that they just threw in lots of swearing to fit in with that marketing of, "These are hardcore.

532
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:06,705
Speaker 1: These are violent.

533
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:07,290
Speaker 1: These are bad.

534
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:08,745
Speaker 1: That's why you should watch

535
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:08,948
Speaker 1: them.".

536
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:17,270
Speaker 1: So being a translator yourself, you're saying that the kind of swearing that was going on was actually sort of appropriate to the original?

537
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:22,630
Speaker 0: When it wasn't, that was a problem, that everything had swearing in it.

538
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:26,270
Speaker 0: But with Cyber City, it really, really did fit the mood.

539
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:35,030
Speaker 0: And I mean, if you've got some hardcore show where you've got some yakas shooting each other, then you're going to want some fucking and whatnot in there, definitely, I would say.

540
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,870
Speaker 0: But it wasn't that bad, though.

541
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:43,809
Speaker 0: I mean, there wasn't any swearing at all in Fist of the North Star and Three by Three Eyes and that kind of thing, I don't think.

542
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:46,730
Speaker 0: Nothing really hardcore more than shit, though, I don't think.

543
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,390
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, there are a lot of dubs that I really like.

544
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,050
Speaker 0: A lot of my favorite actors are voice actors.

545
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,230
Speaker 0: I mean, people like Tony Barry in Dominion Tank Police.

546
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:04,150
Speaker 0: And I don't know, you might not have heard of Peter Marinca, but I think he's American.

547
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,384
Speaker 0: I can't tell because he does so many accents.

548
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:10,949
Speaker 0: But he's been in a lot of manga dubs at the start.

549
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,409
Speaker 0: Doom Megalopolis, did you see that?

550
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,100
Speaker 1: - Yes, yes.

551
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,069
Speaker 1: - We know of it.

552
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:16,690
Speaker 2: I've seen it.

553
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,430
Speaker 0: He was the bad guy in that, although it's been redubbed, so you might not have heard the actual dub.

554
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,339
Speaker 0: But what they did for that?

555
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:36,409
Speaker 0: to recreate the... because it's in 1920s Tokyo, to create the classic feel, they gave everyone English accents, like really kind of Victorian English accents, which sounded weird at first, but then it was kind of... Actually, that's really good.

556
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:39,410
Speaker 0: It kind of feels like the period does.

557
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,770
Speaker 2: Actually, I have a really kind of specific question suddenly that I hope you can answer.

558
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:54,930
Speaker 2: If you've seen the Helsing dub, the original Helsing, not the new whatever, because a lot of people have told me that the British accents were horrible, so I'm curious as to your opinion.

559
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,136
Speaker 0: I haven't.

560
00:36:56,278 --> 00:37:00,630
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it, actually, but I'm interested now, and I would like to have a look at it.

561
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:12,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll have to get back to us on that one, because I do remember that was a dub that was sort of hailed for being good, but also some people put it down for having, you know, bad accents, so...

562
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,649
Speaker 2: And I'll admit I couldn't tell.

563
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:14,778
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

564
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:15,209
Speaker 0: -Mm-hmm.

565
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,390
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

566
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:24,365
Speaker 0: A lot of people tell me that the Cowboy Bebop dub is really, really good, and I watched it, and it's good.

567
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:30,770
Speaker 0: It's good, definitely, but compared to some of the dubs that I remember from the '90s, it really wasn't amazing, I didn't think.

568
00:37:31,653 --> 00:37:33,449
Speaker 0: I mean, I love Dominion Tank for the least.

569
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,610
Speaker 0: That had one of the greatest dubs I've ever heard.

570
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,078
Speaker 2: I'll admit I love that dub.

571
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:38,830
Speaker 2: We just watched that show again recently, too.

572
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,807
Speaker 1: I just read the manga a couple weeks ago, also, so...

573
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:42,994
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

574
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:46,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, Shiro was a king before he turned into a 3D porn artist.

575
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:47,756
Speaker 1: Period.

576
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:48,564
Speaker 0: He was a guy.

577
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:54,689
Speaker 1: Usually we try to make that point a little more subtly, but I guess that works.

578
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:56,679
Speaker 1: It's insane.

579
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,830
Speaker 0: I don't know what happened to him.

580
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:01,049
Speaker 0: We're getting totally off topic here, aren't we?

581
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,657
Speaker 1: That's fine.

582
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,670
Speaker 1: Everything's on topic.

583
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:11,227
Speaker 0: He used to be the king of acrylic paint, and then suddenly he discovered a 3D program, and he was like, "Shit, I'm going to use this in every picture now,".

584
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:16,230
Speaker 0: and then suddenly all his girls are being screwed by tentacles or robots.

585
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:35,430
Speaker 2: I think he was one of those people where he was constrained by whatever, by his time constraints or by editors saying, "No, you can't do this," or whatever, but the inner Shiro was just always trying to get out, and that kind of let him bring out his full glory, kind of like Ikuhara in Utena the Show versus Utena the Movie.

586
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:36,777
Speaker 0: Right.

587
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:37,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

588
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,023
Speaker 0: And the bastard guy.

589
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:39,790
Speaker 0: I forget his name.

590
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:52,729
Speaker 0: Oh, I forget his name, but... He's one of the greatest artists I've ever seen, but apparently I hear from my friends he had a nervous breakdown and just started drawing cocks in every single time.

591
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:56,909
Speaker 1: I guess that's better than the dragon half guy.

592
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:59,089
Speaker 0: Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

593
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:01,469
Speaker 0: Actually, he's one of my major influences.

594
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:08,090
Speaker 0: When I first started drawing, this was like years ago, people used to say to me like, "Your girls just aren't attractive.

595
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,036
Speaker 0: They're all spiky.

596
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,708
Speaker 0: If you tried to snog one of those girls, you'd just cut yourself on their face,".

597
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:15,606
Speaker 0: and I was like, "It's because of the dragon half

598
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:15,848
Speaker 0: guy.".

599
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,602
Speaker 0: It's because I'm following his example.

600
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:19,709
Speaker 0: Everyone has to be spiky.

601
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:23,169
Speaker 0: I've toned it down a bit now, but he's still there.

602
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:27,970
Speaker 1: What is the manga situation like in the UK?

603
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,150
Speaker 1: Because we have lots of manga going on over here.

604
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,508
Speaker 0: Well, that's another one that I'm with Dark Horse on.

605
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:51,369
Speaker 0: Basically, there's been an explosion, but it's unfortunately been an explosion of a lot of companies appearing and jumping on this manga bandwagon and going, "Right, let's get this stuff out on the shelves as soon as we can on the cheapest quality paper that we can.

606
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,569
Speaker 0: Let's just make as much money as we can whilst the fad's there,".

607
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,490
Speaker 0: and so you've got stuff, and it's not flipped.

608
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,069
Speaker 0: It's in Japanese format.

609
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,330
Speaker 0: None of the subtitles, none of the sound effects, rather, are translated.

610
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:08,910
Speaker 0: It seems to be minimum effort, and we've got that in the UK too.

611
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:15,590
Speaker 0: You go into your comic shops and whatnot, and all of the Tokyo pop stuff is there and everything.

612
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,289
Speaker 1: It's the same as it is here.

613
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:32,350
Speaker 0: And it's just really unfortunate, because if you look back in the '90s at the Ghost in the Shell translation and the Dominion translation and Appleseed, I mean, Dark Horse and Studio Approaches, they did a top-class job.

614
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,830
Speaker 0: I mean, they really did.

615
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:40,604
Speaker 0: If they didn't understand the term, Torrance Smith would ring Masamune Shirou up and say, "What did you mean

616
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:40,890
Speaker 0: here?".

617
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:42,924
Speaker 0: And Shirou would be like, "I'm asleep.

618
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:43,246
Speaker 0: Fuck

619
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:43,428
Speaker 0: off.".

620
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:54,150
Speaker 0: And then you tell him what it means, and that's the kind of quality that got me into reading manga in the first place.

621
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,910
Speaker 0: There's no honorifics, there's no notes, there's no footnotes explaining that onigiri means rice ball.

622
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,250
Speaker 0: It's all just perfectly localized into English, and it's just fantastic.

623
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:20,309
Speaker 0: And I'm sure a lot of the modern fansubbers and a lot of the modern fansub fans grew up reading that as well, thinking how great it was, and yet now that would seem really bad to them because they've localized everything into English and got rid of a lot of the Japanese.

624
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,410
Speaker 0: Because you don't need it to understand the story.

625
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,970
Speaker 0: You don't need to know what a nakamadoshi is or anything like that.

626
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,105
Speaker 0: You can just translate it.

627
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:35,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, this wasn't even really an issue for me until I saw your video.

628
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:48,458
Speaker 1: For example, the karaoke thing, if you would have asked me about that, say, six months ago, I would have been like, "Yeah, I don't really pay attention to them, but

629
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:48,846
Speaker 1: whatever.".

630
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,145
Speaker 1: But now I'm like, "Oh, get that karaoke out of

631
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:51,306
Speaker 1: here.".

632
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,669
Speaker 0: Get that shit off my screen.

633
00:41:54,330 --> 00:42:01,067
Speaker 1: But as for the manga, I sort of feel like, I see how the same argument applies.

634
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:06,350
Speaker 1: You should translate it to English, just like we used to.

635
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:10,210
Speaker 1: But manga, it seems like there's something different about it.

636
00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:14,786
Speaker 1: For example, the sound effects in manga are part of the artwork.

637
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:28,489
Speaker 1: So if you were to erase them and replace them with English, isn't that sort of the same as in the anime, like when they write English on the gravestones and such?

638
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:30,657
Speaker 0: You've got me there.

639
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:32,430
Speaker 0: That's a very good point, actually.

640
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,148
Speaker 0: But I think that if it's done with the blessing of the artist...

641
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:37,063
Speaker 1: That is true.

642
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:44,550
Speaker 0: If you remember, when Ghost in the Shell came out, the manga, that is, it was missing the dodgy lesbian scene.

643
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:49,030
Speaker 0: And so that's back in now in the latest release.

644
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,549
Speaker 0: But the three pages of dodgy lesbianism were missed out because otherwise it would have had to be adult-rated and put on the top shelves.

645
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,550
Speaker 0: And so what they did was they got Shiro to redraw the pages himself.

646
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:09,430
Speaker 0: And that's the kind of close-knit relationship with the creator of the original work that I'm talking about.

647
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:21,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I like it when they change the sound effects and put them into English, but it requires a massive level of artistic skill to actually change the panels like that.

648
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,029
Speaker 0: And you've got to do it with the artist's blessing or you're pissing all over their work.

649
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:40,390
Speaker 0: And obviously fansubs just do it, I don't know, just basically to show that they're better than other groups because they were able to put a bigger subtitle above "Police Station" that says "Police Station" or "Toilet" above a restroom or whatever.

650
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,510
Speaker 0: It's just, no, I don't know, it's just really annoying.

651
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:50,130
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, of course it would be ideal to have the original artists work with the translators the way Shiro worked with Dark Horse.

652
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,870
Speaker 1: And I guess I think Otomo also worked with Dark Horse back in the day.

653
00:43:54,792 --> 00:44:07,439
Speaker 1: But considering that some people, like say Tezuka, no longer live and other Japanese creators, they don't have a lot of free time or they don't know English at all.

654
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:16,530
Speaker 1: I mean, Satoshi Ka, we saw him a few weeks ago and he doesn't know English really at all.

655
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,230
Speaker 1: He knew how to say thank you and whatever.

656
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:30,630
Speaker 1: So wouldn't it be better to just do it the way they're doing it so that way we can at least read the manga as opposed to the alternative, which would be, you know, nothing?

657
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:36,889
Speaker 0: Rather than having nothing at all, it's probably better, yeah, I guess.

658
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:45,830
Speaker 0: But I can't help but feel that it's just done that way just because it's quicker and cheaper is the trouble.

659
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:53,588
Speaker 0: I mean, they've successfully advertised it as, "Oh, we're actually doing it right to left because that keeps the original

660
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:53,889
Speaker 0: feel.".

661
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:59,630
Speaker 0: But I think it's no, it's because you don't have to spend months flipping all the pages and adjusting the artwork.

662
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,689
Speaker 0: I think it's just cheap.

663
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:11,450
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it is cheaper, but shouldn't we, I mean, when you flip the artwork, you're sort of, I mean, there's a difference in the anime, right?

664
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:15,248
Speaker 1: When you subtitle it, you're not changing anything.

665
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,430
Speaker 1: You're just sort of providing the translation to be understood.

666
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:24,670
Speaker 1: But if you flip the manga, that's actually changing the artwork.

667
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:27,970
Speaker 1: So are you crossing a line there?

668
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:37,170
Speaker 1: Because I can't tell you, I've read a lot of flipped manga, and the original Akira from Dark Horse is still only available in a flipped version.

669
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,169
Speaker 2: Or like Sanctuary and Eagle and all that.

670
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, the older Viz manga.

671
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:52,110
Speaker 1: And you do notice when you read them that there are certain panels that they just read out of order, or there are guys who are facing the wrong direction, and the camera sort of crosses.

672
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,850
Speaker 1: I guess it's a manga, so there's no camera.

673
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,690
Speaker 1: But you break all sorts of rules where you can't figure out.

674
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:04,970
Speaker 1: But then when you look at it, especially in action manga, when it's unflipped, everything looks right, and it works much better.

675
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,531
Speaker 0: Right.

676
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:12,510
Speaker 0: I can't say I've ever had that problem myself, but I don't know.

677
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:22,310
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously the main problem that people say is that in Kenshin or whatever, suddenly he becomes left-handed because it's flipped and things like that.

678
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:33,110
Speaker 0: But again, if it was a properly professional job, then you could get around all that kind of stuff, and all the logos on the t-shirts and whatnot could be redrawn so that they're the proper way around again.

679
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:43,510
Speaker 0: But I mean, I understand that it takes so long to do, and so a lot of companies, they're just going to want to keep it in the Japanese format.

680
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:49,970
Speaker 1: And also you mentioned just now that you complained that the manga was printed on really cheap paper.

681
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,370
Speaker 1: But isn't manga in Japan printed on the cheapest paper imaginable?

682
00:46:54,471 --> 00:46:56,344
Speaker 1: that's not really used for anything in the U.S.

683
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:57,110
Speaker 1: because it's so cheap?

684
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,528
Speaker 0: Oh, indeed, yeah.

685
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:01,270
Speaker 1: So we should be getting even cheaper paper than we're getting.

686
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,710
Speaker 0: I'm a complete hypocrite there.

687
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,510
Speaker 2: But then we should also be getting the giant anthologies and all that sort of...

688
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:08,490
Speaker 0: That's the thing, yeah.

689
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:09,790
Speaker 1: I would love to get the anthology.

690
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:29,149
Speaker 0: That was the payoff that we had in that Viz would release Dominion, and it would only be 30 pages or whatever, but it would be on really nice paper with a really nice cover, whereas in Japan you'd get it as part of a massive anthology, and the payoff would be that you'd have to have it on toilet paper that you wouldn't even wipe your ass on.

691
00:47:30,612 --> 00:47:42,088
Speaker 0: So I think it kind of swings and roundabouts, and we got a lot of stuff that they didn't because things come in the big anthology form over there, although I would like to see that.

692
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:45,430
Speaker 0: I mean, do we get that in the West?

693
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:46,809
Speaker 0: Not really.

694
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,007
Speaker 0: Probably not in English, but...

695
00:47:48,371 --> 00:48:12,050
Speaker 2: Part of the problem is that it seems like the whole Tokyo Pop thing, you talk about how they were kind of get it out there as fast as possible, and they tried in America at least first with the violent, hardcore manga, and they brought out Sanctuary and all these kind of very adult, very heavy-hitting things, and they sold okay but not really well, and then when they brought out the Tokyo Pop shoujo-y stuff, it sold really well, so they brought out nothing but that.

696
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,969
Speaker 2: And as a result, we don't even get any of the kind of adult or serious but not pornographic manga in the US.

697
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:18,553
Speaker 1: Well, we do.

698
00:48:18,614 --> 00:48:20,790
Speaker 1: We get some from Dark Horse and Vertical.

699
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,490
Speaker 2: Yes, but compared to how much there is in Japan, we get very little.

700
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,094
Speaker 0: Indeed, yeah.

701
00:48:26,497 --> 00:48:27,764
Speaker 0: I mean, that is a shame.

702
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:28,770
Speaker 0: That's a problem.

703
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:32,630
Speaker 0: I don't think that all of Bastard is out still.

704
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,070
Speaker 1: I'll have to look that up because I do know some of it at least is out.

705
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:37,929
Speaker 1: I'll have to go check.

706
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:58,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember in the early '90s about two volumes had come out in the UK, and there was loads more in Japan, but obviously you've got the issue there that they basically had to say, "Look, just go on holiday or something because it's taken us so long to edit out your cocks that you draw on every frame.

707
00:49:00,152 --> 00:49:03,048
Speaker 0: So just go and take a holiday until you get your head

708
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:03,330
Speaker 0: right.".

709
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:10,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy from the manga cast actually on his website put a list of all the manga that were sort of cancelled in the US.

710
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:17,689
Speaker 1: Someone bought the license, but they failed to finish the series or didn't actually ever get a volume out or something like that.

711
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:19,416
Speaker 0: Right.

712
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:20,729
Speaker 0: I guess it's quite a big list.

713
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,689
Speaker 1: It's actually not that big, but there are some pretty sad things on there.

714
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:26,489
Speaker 0: Right, right.

715
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,510
Speaker 2: All right, so let's go back off on a different tack a little bit.

716
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:32,314
Speaker 2: The documentary.

717
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:37,157
Speaker 2: Did you get a lot of hate mail once it was released and once people started seeing it?

718
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:39,170
Speaker 2: What kind of response did you get directly?

719
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:54,050
Speaker 0: Well, most of the response was actually on YouTube to each one, but there were a few forums like Anime Ski and Kaizoku Fan Subs, who actually got quite a bad deal in the video, if you remember.

720
00:49:54,650 --> 00:50:00,838
Speaker 0: Kaizoku Fan Subs, a lot of the things that they actually say really, really pissed me off.

721
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,930
Speaker 0: Their actual translation, what's the word?

722
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:09,650
Speaker 2: Oh, when you showed in your video their official statement about this is how we feel.

723
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,917
Speaker 0: Their official statement.

724
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:11,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, indeed.

725
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:25,989
Speaker 0: Their official statement on like, "Mikan doesn't just mean tangerine, it's got all these special connotations with money and wealth in Japanese, and so to translate it as tangerine, we can't do that because it's missing out all these special...".

726
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:27,359
Speaker 0: Bullshit.

727
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,730
Speaker 0: It just means tangerine.

728
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:41,210
Speaker 0: It's just that one character, like, put some kind of, I don't know, meaning of money onto it or something, and suddenly, oh, I don't know, and nakama as well, nakama is the worst one of all.

729
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,679
Speaker 0: You just translate it differently each time.

730
00:50:43,700 --> 00:51:00,890
Speaker 0: It's not a special word in Japanese, it's only a special word in one piece because of the way that that particular author uses it, and dynamic equivalence, which is the form of translation school that I follow, says that basically you don't have to translate.

731
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:05,750
Speaker 0: Like, if someone says "chikusho," you don't have to translate it as shit every single time.

732
00:51:06,292 --> 00:51:18,582
Speaker 0: You can translate it as something different depending on what the scene calls for, and so when someone says "nakama," you don't have to translate it as shitmate or comrade or friend or like whatever every single time.

733
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:20,230
Speaker 0: You translate it different each time.

734
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:35,562
Speaker 0: You can get around it, but they say that no, no, it has to be nakama every single time because it's such a special meaning that the pathetic English language can't hope to get the nuances across, and it's like, well, that's just ridiculous.

735
00:51:35,582 --> 00:51:37,090
Speaker 0: That's just ridiculous.

736
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:42,429
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, maybe comrade sounds a bit Russian, but I mean, shitmate, come on.

737
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:44,237
Speaker 0: It's about pirates.

738
00:51:44,478 --> 00:51:45,745
Speaker 0: Just say shitmate.

739
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:46,530
Speaker 0: That's fine.

740
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:51,450
Speaker 1: That is one thing that bothered me even back in the days.

741
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:57,488
Speaker 1: You would watch, say, Ranma, and someone would say like, you know, "Baka, baka, baka, baka, baka," and the subtitle would just be "stupid, stupid, stupid,

742
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:57,769
Speaker 1: stupid.".

743
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,503
Speaker 1: And I'd be like, who says "stupid" that many times?

744
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:03,410
Speaker 1: It's not natural English.

745
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,416
Speaker 1: You would say like, "You stupid

746
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:05,797
Speaker 1: idiot."

747
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:08,970
Speaker 1: You'd have like this big, long insult sentence.

748
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,432
Speaker 0: Exactly.

749
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:13,489
Speaker 0: Again, that's what you can do in English that you can't do in Japanese.

750
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:27,390
Speaker 0: I mean, they'll just say "baka" like a bunch of times, but as you say, in the English, they could have done something really creative and created a massive string of incredible insults there, which would have looked cool and be incredibly funny as well.

751
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:33,170
Speaker 0: But I guess they just left "stupid, stupid, stupid" and it looked stupid like you said.

752
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:36,021
Speaker 2: You mentioned the, I guess, dynamic translations.

753
00:52:36,122 --> 00:52:37,790
Speaker 2: What are the other schools of translation?

754
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,294
Speaker 2: I'm curious.

755
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:39,990
Speaker 2: This is not a topic I know a lot about.

756
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:41,072
Speaker 0: Right.

757
00:52:41,112 --> 00:52:41,635
Speaker 0: Okay.

758
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:44,030
Speaker 0: I learned a lot about this on my master's course.

759
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:50,970
Speaker 0: I did a translation studies course, and this is actually where a lot of the documentary comes from.

760
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:55,590
Speaker 0: My, I guess, graduation thesis, you call it, dissertation.

761
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:03,210
Speaker 0: My end-of-year dissertation was on anime translation, anime and game translation, and the two different schools.

762
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:08,950
Speaker 0: And a lot of my quotes and things that I use in the video come directly from my dissertation.

763
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,610
Speaker 1: Is there a way for us to get the dissertation?

764
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:17,610
Speaker 0: I think it's on my DeviantArt account.

765
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:23,170
Speaker 0: I think it's on either that or the one from the year before from my actual Japanese course.

766
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,309
Speaker 0: But I'll dig it out and put it up somewhere.

767
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:34,090
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically, it's a translation debate that's raged since Bible translation times.

768
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,499
Speaker 0: And there's two schools, basically.

769
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,470
Speaker 0: I mean, there's more than two, but there's two main ones.

770
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:43,630
Speaker 0: One half thinks that the original language is so great that you need to leave it all in the original format.

771
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:50,490
Speaker 0: And the other side says that that defeats the point of translation, and they actually want to translate it into the target language.

772
00:53:51,330 --> 00:54:00,870
Speaker 0: And so as an English translator who translates into English, I follow a school called Dynamic Equivalence that actually wants to translate anime, manga and games into English.

773
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,589
Speaker 0: And some good examples of dynamic equivalents are games like Phoenix Wright, which I'm sure you're aware of.

774
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:10,290
Speaker 0: You must have played Phoenix Wright.

775
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:12,965
Speaker 1: I own all four.

776
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:13,510
Speaker 1: I beat them all.

777
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:19,950
Speaker 0: All the jokes and all the puns have just been expertly localized.

778
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,061
Speaker 0: Or games like Snatcher on the Sega CD.

779
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:24,990
Speaker 0: Do you know about Snatcher?

780
00:54:25,634 --> 00:54:26,164
Speaker 1: I know of it.

781
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:34,550
Speaker 0: Well, you know Jeremy Blaustein, the translating god who translated Metal Gear Solid?

782
00:54:34,976 --> 00:54:35,350
Speaker 1: I do now.

783
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:39,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, Metal Gear Solid, the script on.

784
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,130
Speaker 0: that is probably one of the greatest translation scripts I've ever read in my entire life.

785
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,769
Speaker 0: But he started out doing Konami games like Snatcher, translating them.

786
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:52,750
Speaker 0: And basically that's just Dynamic Equivalence.

787
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:59,850
Speaker 0: Like, you won't find a single honorific or a single cultural note in Snatcher or in Metal Gear.

788
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:07,390
Speaker 0: Basically, if you didn't know that it was Japanese, you'd think that Metal Gear had been written by Tom Clancy or someone.

789
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:17,870
Speaker 0: And that's kind of the point of Dynamic Equivalence, that you are creating a translation which someone reads and it sounds completely natural to them.

790
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:24,809
Speaker 0: And so not once in their head are they taken out of the experience of watching the show by thinking, "Ooh, that sounds a bit

791
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:25,130
Speaker 0: weird.".

792
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:35,010
Speaker 0: It just sounds... And I'm not, for one second, saying that you should change names and change Yakumo in 3x3 eyes to Brad Spangler or something.

793
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:36,906
Speaker 0: You should never do that.

794
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:46,010
Speaker 0: But yeah, Dynamic Equivalence is just... Well, another example is Dark Horse's early manga translations that I was talking about.

795
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:51,270
Speaker 0: They convert all the honorifics in their Japanese terms to English and they just do an incredible top class job.

796
00:55:52,071 --> 00:56:04,250
Speaker 0: And probably the translations of Appleseed and Dominion and Ghost in the Shell were just some of the greatest examples of a seamless read which doesn't lose any of the original plot story or character names.

797
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,189
Speaker 0: And again, no honorifics, nothing like that.

798
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:11,430
Speaker 1: So these fansubbers, what they're doing is following the other school.

799
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:17,822
Speaker 1: And you say in your video that all the professional companies are in your school.

800
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:21,510
Speaker 1: Are there any professionals who have the other idea about it?

801
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:25,449
Speaker 0: Well, the other school is called Formal Equivalence.

802
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:29,770
Speaker 0: And again, it all comes from Bible translation mainly.

803
00:56:30,232 --> 00:56:34,029
Speaker 0: And it believes that if you change any of the source text, you lose the meaning and you ruin it.

804
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:42,329
Speaker 0: Which is why fansubbers leave in all the honorifics and put in the Japanese name order and produce incredible lines like the famous "Inawashishiro

805
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:42,730
Speaker 0: Kamehamehasi.".

806
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:45,140
Speaker 0: I can't even read it.

807
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,610
Speaker 0: The one that was on the video.

808
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:54,528
Speaker 0: "Inawashishiro Kamehamehasama has sent the meat of a renowned bushi from Izumono Kuni from View to

809
00:56:54,608 --> 00:56:55,029
Speaker 0: enjoy.".

810
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:55,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one.

811
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:58,030
Speaker 1: I didn't understand that at all.

812
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,270
Speaker 0: I thought probably that I should repeat that about five times in the video.

813
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,630
Speaker 0: But yeah, unfortunately, that's the problem.

814
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:19,330
Speaker 0: A lot of DVD companies now are moving towards the Formal Equivalence because they've seen, I guess, that that's what fansubbers and people who watch anime mainly watch fansubs.

815
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:21,048
Speaker 0: I think it's fair to say.

816
00:57:22,892 --> 00:57:23,736
Speaker 0: That's what they want.

817
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,043
Speaker 0: They want Formal Equivalence.

818
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,470
Speaker 0: They want everything in Japanese.

819
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:33,410
Speaker 1: I mean, outside of the anime translation world, say the people who translate French films to English.

820
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:39,870
Speaker 1: There's a lot of translating of Hollywood movies into all sorts of other languages.

821
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,140
Speaker 1: Japanese, French, German, Italian.

822
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:46,250
Speaker 1: Are those people also using Dynamic Equivalence?

823
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:49,370
Speaker 0: They're using Dynamic Equivalence from what I've seen.

824
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:52,930
Speaker 0: I put a couple of examples in the video.

825
00:57:53,410 --> 00:58:01,230
Speaker 0: I mean, Bollywood especially, there's loads of honorifics in Hindi and various other Indian languages.

826
00:58:02,331 --> 00:58:06,610
Speaker 0: And we were watching a few Bollywood films recently and they're all just localized.

827
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,637
Speaker 0: They're all just localized.

828
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:09,844
Speaker 0: It doesn't say Babuji.

829
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:10,790
Speaker 0: It says Dad.

830
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:15,610
Speaker 0: So it's Dynamic Equivalence pretty much all the way.

831
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:25,090
Speaker 0: There's a French film called Just Visiting with the really cool guy Jean Renaud.

832
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:28,161
Speaker 0: I think it's Jean Renaud.

833
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:29,730
Speaker 0: Either that or Gerard Depardieu.

834
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:36,430
Speaker 0: Anyway, some of the subtitles, the English subtitles for that, that was a masterpiece of Dynamic Equivalence.

835
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,308
Speaker 0: I was laughing my ass off at that.

836
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:41,989
Speaker 0: And if they just left all the French in, it just wouldn't have been funny at all.

837
00:58:42,912 --> 00:58:48,670
Speaker 0: So mainly, yeah, professional companies, they use formal equivalents and that's what fansubs used to do.

838
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,650
Speaker 0: They used to try and be professional, is the point of my video.

839
00:58:53,230 --> 00:59:02,970
Speaker 2: A lot of earlier anime releases would take the music and re-perform it in English to kind of translate the music along with it.

840
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,769
Speaker 2: What's your opinion on that?

841
00:59:05,991 --> 00:59:07,448
Speaker 0: Pioneer used to do it, didn't they?

842
00:59:07,468 --> 00:59:07,630
Speaker 0: A lot.

843
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,279
Speaker 2: I remember I watched Henshi and all those things.

844
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,270
Speaker 2: I have all the songs in English and Japanese.

845
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:19,245
Speaker 2: Regardless of how it works, in terms of listening to the two, they sound very similar.

846
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,090
Speaker 2: It was just amazing how close they get.

847
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,650
Speaker 0: I remember Moldiver was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid.

848
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:29,290
Speaker 0: I look at it now and it looks a bit ugly compared to the artwork of the stuff that I was watching at the time.

849
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,050
Speaker 0: But yeah, Pioneer would just do two versions, wouldn't they?

850
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:38,290
Speaker 0: They'd do the English version of the song and then the Japanese original.

851
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:41,130
Speaker 0: And you could just pick which one you liked, basically.

852
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:43,430
Speaker 0: And I think that's really cool, actually.

853
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:52,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we once did a whole sort of week and I was watching all the different openers to different anime from around the world.

854
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:58,889
Speaker 1: And we found the Italian One Piece opening song and the German Sailor Moon are fantastic.

855
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:01,078
Speaker 0: Oh, the German Sailor Moon.

856
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:02,767
Speaker 0: Oh, don't remind me about that.

857
01:00:06,132 --> 01:00:14,930
Speaker 0: We were so starved of anime in the UK that when satellite TV came out, because it wasn't digital, it was satellite.

858
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,390
Speaker 0: You used to be able to get signals bounced off from German satellites and stuff.

859
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:24,023
Speaker 0: And I found that if I finally tuned it in the morning, then about 7 a.m.

860
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:26,690
Speaker 0: every Saturday, I used to be able to get Sailor Moon in German.

861
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:32,470
Speaker 0: And that opening sequence, that German opening song, it's still in my head now.

862
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:33,687
Speaker 0: I can't get rid of it.

863
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,241
Speaker 0: And they used it for every series.

864
01:00:36,282 --> 01:00:37,750
Speaker 0: They never changed the opening.

865
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:39,750
Speaker 0: They always just used that same one.

866
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:51,410
Speaker 1: It's pretty interesting that something that I found on YouTube and thought was pretty cool, you basically had drilled into your head for decades earlier.

867
01:00:53,573 --> 01:00:55,261
Speaker 0: I learned a little bit of German.

868
01:00:55,602 --> 01:00:57,009
Speaker 0: I can't speak any German at all.

869
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,540
Speaker 0: But I learned a little bit of German.

870
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:05,769
Speaker 0: From watching Sailor Moon so many times.

871
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:10,087
Speaker 0: And I've been Sailor Moon in the... What was it?

872
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:12,847
Speaker 0: In the name of the moon, I'm the best!

873
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:15,548
Speaker 0: Like that.

874
01:01:17,254 --> 01:01:19,229
Speaker 0: And I've still not seen it in Japanese.

875
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:26,690
Speaker 2: Sadly, being also starved for anime, it was difficult to get a lot of it.

876
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,550
Speaker 2: I ended up watching all of Sailor Moon.

877
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:34,390
Speaker 2: I got Japanese fansubs by I think Vkill, who did, now that I think back, incredibly professional fansubs.

878
01:01:35,557 --> 01:01:35,830
Speaker 0: Really?

879
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,310
Speaker 1: Well, that was the old mail your VHS tape away days.

880
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:46,270
Speaker 2: Yes, I literally said, I bought these VHS tapes and the dude sent me the VHS tapes back from his SVHS masters.

881
01:01:47,232 --> 01:01:48,790
Speaker 0: He genlocked his own translation.

882
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,789
Speaker 0: A lot of my stuff was like that.

883
01:01:52,512 --> 01:01:56,550
Speaker 0: But yeah, the dual song thing, I always like it when they do that.

884
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:01,050
Speaker 0: I think it shows if the English version is any good.

885
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,770
Speaker 0: And they generally were with Pioneer.

886
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,510
Speaker 0: I mean, they certainly knew their music.

887
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:11,170
Speaker 0: But I've been watching my favorite Gundam series, Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory.

888
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,728
Speaker 0: And we watched that the other day.

889
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:19,550
Speaker 0: And when I had picked myself up off the floor, because the artwork is so fucking insane.

890
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:25,950
Speaker 0: You can notice that actually that's got a number of different versions of the songs on it as well.

891
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:33,209
Speaker 0: So the openings are in Japanese, but on the soundtrack CD you can get them in English as well.

892
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:37,390
Speaker 0: And sung by the same singer in pretty good English.

893
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,770
Speaker 0: But the lyrics are completely different and they're actually really, really good.

894
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:44,270
Speaker 2: How about, very specifically, Dominion Tank Police?

895
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:48,670
Speaker 2: Because they pretty much redid all the music for the English dub.

896
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:52,830
Speaker 2: And they didn't even redo it as in taking the Japanese song and just kind of doing it in English.

897
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:56,150
Speaker 2: They completely redid it and just made up all new music.

898
01:02:57,252 --> 01:02:59,470
Speaker 2: At least with the original Tank Police opening song.

899
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:05,390
Speaker 2: Hot Dance and Cherry Moon was kind of this generic pop song that they threw in.

900
01:03:06,694 --> 01:03:08,270
Speaker 2: I really like the American opener.

901
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:09,236
Speaker 2: I know what you mean.

902
01:03:12,431 --> 01:03:13,595
Speaker 0: This is a weird one with me.

903
01:03:13,675 --> 01:03:18,670
Speaker 0: Like the Street Fighter movie and the redub of all the music that they did with that.

904
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:24,690
Speaker 0: I've got a friend over the road, probably the biggest Macross fan in the whole of England, called Rick Newman.

905
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:33,930
Speaker 0: And he to this day refuses to watch the manga version of the Street Fighter 2 animated movie because the music isn't right.

906
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:36,518
Speaker 1: Well, Macross is another one.

907
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:38,669
Speaker 1: In Robotech they redid all the music, right?

908
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:40,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

909
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:45,070
Speaker 0: But at least that was in Robotech and you know that you're not watching Macross.

910
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,690
Speaker 0: So you can just watch Macross and hear all the proper music.

911
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,369
Speaker 0: Although it is very confusing.

912
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:53,270
Speaker 0: But yeah, he feels the same way about Dominion as well.

913
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:59,670
Speaker 0: And the trouble is, I grew up with the American version of Dominion and I just love the music.

914
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:02,197
Speaker 0: I think it fits it really, really well.

915
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:07,250
Speaker 0: It's all kind of ambient and kind of synthesiser-y and it just fits the scene so well.

916
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,139
Speaker 0: And when I heard the Japanese soundtrack I was like, "What the hell is this?

917
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:14,248
Speaker 0: This doesn't fit the atmosphere at

918
01:04:14,508 --> 01:04:14,569
Speaker 0: all!".

919
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:21,689
Speaker 0: So maybe I think it's like, you know, when you get into a band, you ask Metallica fans what their favourite album is.

920
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,910
Speaker 0: And generally it's the one that they heard first.

921
01:04:25,851 --> 01:04:28,409
Speaker 0: So I think whichever you hear first you probably like best.

922
01:04:29,318 --> 01:04:30,450
Speaker 0: It's the same with Cyber City.

923
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:37,570
Speaker 0: If you've seen that manga video completely, we did the music with some hardcore metal and thrash.

924
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,229
Speaker 0: And it's just incredible.

925
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,370
Speaker 0: And then you watch the Japanese one and it's all just kind of really kind of tingly pop.

926
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,670
Speaker 0: And it doesn't fit the atmosphere for me at all.

927
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:53,410
Speaker 0: Even though that's the original music and that's probably what should be on there as well.

928
01:04:53,831 --> 01:04:57,185
Speaker 1: Well doesn't that sometimes make it hard to judge which is better?

929
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:03,690
Speaker 1: Because you're really influenced by what you've gotten used to in some way.

930
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:13,850
Speaker 1: So what would be the proper way to say which one is more correct or more better if you're not influenced by just what you're used to?

931
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:17,430
Speaker 1: Or what you happen to have a personal attachment to?

932
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:20,750
Speaker 0: I reckon the best way is just to watch both of them loads.

933
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:25,330
Speaker 0: I mean the Street Fighter animated movie is so incredible that you can just watch it.

934
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,149
Speaker 0: I mean I must have watched it like 40 times.

935
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:34,388
Speaker 0: So I've watched the English dub with the American music about 20 times.

936
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,025
Speaker 0: And I've watched the Japanese one about 20 times.

937
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,129
Speaker 0: And it gets to a point where you just love them both.

938
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:48,150
Speaker 0: I mean the final fight song where they're fighting Vega in the Japanese one, the song to that is just incredible.

939
01:05:48,713 --> 01:05:51,470
Speaker 0: But it's kind of incredible in the pop way.

940
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:57,090
Speaker 0: And you watch the American one and they're fighting him and his guitar is thrashing away.

941
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,149
Speaker 0: And it just sounds incredibly actiony.

942
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:06,090
Speaker 0: And I mean you've got the famous scene with Chun-Li and Balrog where he comes down to kick her ass.

943
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:13,290
Speaker 0: And obviously in the Japanese one that's just some really kind of subdued music in the background.

944
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:15,530
Speaker 0: So it kind of feels a bit like a ballet.

945
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:20,250
Speaker 0: You've got violence and really soft music which was obviously their intent.

946
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:28,050
Speaker 0: And then in the American music you've got again some hardcore metal playing which looks amazing again.

947
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,208
Speaker 0: So they both work.

948
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:34,046
Speaker 0: So I reckon the only way to do it is to just watch them both loads.

949
01:06:35,911 --> 01:06:38,689
Speaker 0: And eventually you get to appreciate both I think.

950
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:42,085
Speaker 1: You obviously can translate Japanese and not German.

951
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,530
Speaker 1: But are there any other languages you translate?

952
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,528
Speaker 0: Various English dialects into other English dialects.

953
01:06:53,053 --> 01:06:55,150
Speaker 0: We've got a lot of different regional accents.

954
01:06:55,890 --> 01:07:01,870
Speaker 0: I remember in school the first time I met a Scottish guy and I couldn't understand the word he was saying.

955
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:05,066
Speaker 0: And after about five days I was like "I understand this

956
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:05,247
Speaker 0: now.".

957
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,209
Speaker 0: But no, Japanese to English, that's it.

958
01:07:08,753 --> 01:07:09,860
Speaker 0: I can't do it the other way.

959
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:11,330
Speaker 0: The other way around is impossible.

960
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:20,230
Speaker 0: Because people think that if you can translate from Japanese to English, then you can meet a Japanese person on the street and just strike up a conversation in Japanese.

961
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,549
Speaker 0: But it's totally not true.

962
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,230
Speaker 0: About all I can say is my name is Paul Johnson and that's about it really.

963
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:32,470
Speaker 0: And then maybe quote Omae wa mou shindeiru or you're already dead from Fist of the North star anthem.

964
01:07:33,072 --> 01:07:34,708
Speaker 0: And hope they see the funny side of it.

965
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:41,345
Speaker 2: So some people would point this out, and we've noticed this before, but at least in America, you're saying "oh, my voice,

966
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:41,729
Speaker 2: whatever.".

967
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:51,879
Speaker 2: But in America there's this kind of subconscious perception that whenever someone has an English or a British accent of any kind, it always sounds more literate.

968
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:54,670
Speaker 2: It's weird, but it affects us in this way.

969
01:07:56,133 --> 01:07:59,770
Speaker 2: So could you do for me what you would think would be an American accent?

970
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,949
Speaker 2: Because I love nothing more than hearing what other people think we sound like.

971
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:06,569
Speaker 0: I don't know if I can.

972
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:12,830
Speaker 2: There's no way you could offend us because I'll point out that the only English accents we can do are Monty Python based.

973
01:08:15,211 --> 01:08:18,524
Speaker 0: Well, I could say Metal Gear for you.

974
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:19,870
Speaker 0: That's about it really.

975
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:25,870
Speaker 0: I used to do a really good liquid snake impression, but I can only do that after playing the game and then it dies away.

976
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:27,667
Speaker 1: That's really good.

977
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:33,800
Speaker 1: Alright, so you seem to like Metal Gear.

978
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,746
Speaker 1: What video game consoles do you have?

979
01:08:36,026 --> 01:08:37,149
Speaker 1: What are your favorite games?

980
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:47,270
Speaker 0: Well, my head's stuck in the 80s, and I'm an old man, so my favorite is the Mega Drive or the Genesis over there, I believe.

981
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:53,229
Speaker 0: My favorite is the Mega Drive and the Mega CD or the Sega CD.

982
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:57,428
Speaker 0: I mean, people slag off the Sega CD and say it was a pile of shit, but it really wasn't.

983
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:04,270
Speaker 0: And anyone who says that is just talking out of their arse, because essentially it was a masterpiece.

984
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:12,529
Speaker 0: It was like someone had poured liquid gold into a mold and out came the Mega CD as a beautiful machine.

985
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:17,970
Speaker 0: And yeah, admittedly I only had about three games for it, but so what?

986
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:20,879
Speaker 0: The music on those games was so good.

987
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:23,788
Speaker 0: It's got the best Sonic game that I've ever played, Sonic CD.

988
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,417
Speaker 0: The music on Sonic CD was fantastic.

989
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:31,529
Speaker 0: And when I heard that they changed it for the American release, I was like, what the hell?

990
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:35,278
Speaker 0: Because luckily in the UK we got the Japanese soundtrack.

991
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,149
Speaker 0: In Europe you got the Japanese music, but in America they just changed it all and it's totally bizarre.

992
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:45,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a re-release and I forget if they kept the original music or not.

993
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:46,490
Speaker 1: There was some talk about that.

994
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:48,330
Speaker 0: Right, right, okay.

995
01:09:48,953 --> 01:09:50,049
Speaker 1: I have to go look that up again.

996
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:58,570
Speaker 0: I played, what were they called, Core Design before they decided to put all of their money into Lara Croft.

997
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,855
Speaker 0: They actually made some really, really good games.

998
01:10:01,536 --> 01:10:09,582
Speaker 0: And I remember Battle Core and Thunderhawk on the Mega CD and the music on those were just... Because I mean, that was its main asset, the Mega CD.

999
01:10:09,642 --> 01:10:11,110
Speaker 0: It could do CD quality music.

1000
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:21,730
Speaker 0: And so they just used it to the full and every soundtrack to pretty much every game was just a masterpiece that you could listen to and just enjoy just for its music.

1001
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,910
Speaker 0: I mean Final Fight on the Mega CD is still the best version of Final Fight you can get.

1002
01:10:26,231 --> 01:10:27,118
Speaker 1: Oh, I never played that one.

1003
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:28,489
Speaker 1: I'll have to go after that.

1004
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:34,242
Speaker 0: I'm including the arcade game with that because the music is so much better than the arcade version.

1005
01:10:34,703 --> 01:10:37,510
Speaker 0: It's all just been remixed with guitars and it just sounds amazing.

1006
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:47,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that I think about it, a lot of the old PC CD-ROM games they used to play on DOS, they would fill that CD up with actual CD audio.

1007
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,109
Speaker 1: You could put it in your CD player and play it because it was just a CD.

1008
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,069
Speaker 0: Totally, yeah, yeah.

1009
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:55,660
Speaker 1: There was a lot of really good music on Descent 2 or Doom.

1010
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,970
Speaker 1: that was on CD sounded really good, Quake, with all the music in it.

1011
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:02,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone's got to bring that back.

1012
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:05,535
Speaker 0: I know, I kind of wish they would.

1013
01:11:05,676 --> 01:11:11,050
Speaker 0: Music in games, yeah, there's still some really good music in games.

1014
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:18,170
Speaker 0: But when it was the main asset, like with the Mega CD, they just really, really went for it in a way that they just don't seem to do now.

1015
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,356
Speaker 2: So you're obviously a Metal Gear fan.

1016
01:11:20,517 --> 01:11:23,970
Speaker 2: I assume you've played the original Metal Gear for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1017
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:27,989
Speaker 0: I had a go on the emulator the other day.

1018
01:11:30,771 --> 01:11:36,121
Speaker 0: But the trouble is, it's so different to the Metal Gear Solid that I'm used to.

1019
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:37,123
Speaker 0: I was like, "What the hell?

1020
01:11:37,243 --> 01:11:38,685
Speaker 0: I can't get past this guy.

1021
01:11:39,246 --> 01:11:40,108
Speaker 0: He keeps seeing me.

1022
01:11:40,148 --> 01:11:40,910
Speaker 0: Where the fuck is my

1023
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,130
Speaker 0: radar?".

1024
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had the opposite.

1025
01:11:44,358 --> 01:11:48,090
Speaker 1: We played the old one and then the new one, so it's a bit different.

1026
01:11:49,031 --> 01:11:50,865
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Hey, where are the trucks for me to get

1027
01:11:50,925 --> 01:11:51,147
Speaker 1: into?".

1028
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:53,364
Speaker 2: The trucks have started to move.

1029
01:11:53,484 --> 01:11:54,230
Speaker 2: There's a bad translation.

1030
01:11:57,712 --> 01:12:00,019
Speaker 0: Oh, missed translations are some of the best things.

1031
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,910
Speaker 0: I mean, you must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance as a classic.

1032
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:11,590
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the thing is, a lot of those translations for, say, old video games were limited by memory.

1033
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:15,199
Speaker 1: You needed more physical characters.

1034
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:19,610
Speaker 1: You needed more space in the technology to put more words.

1035
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,081
Speaker 2: It was literally like, "Alright, there are 18 Japanese characters.

1036
01:12:24,262 --> 01:12:26,248
Speaker 2: How can we say this in 18 English

1037
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:26,629
Speaker 2: letters?".

1038
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:31,578
Speaker 0: It's not quite that bad, but it is still quite bad now.

1039
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:36,810
Speaker 0: A lot of the game translation, in fact, all of the game translation work I get is in Excel format.

1040
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:40,096
Speaker 0: And you've got a character limit that you have to stick to.

1041
01:12:40,117 --> 01:12:45,750
Speaker 0: And often, on the left is the Japanese and on the right is the space for you to write your English translation.

1042
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:54,810
Speaker 0: And on the left, you've got a five kanji compound, which means super spinning, multipart, deathblow, super special attack.

1043
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:58,180
Speaker 0: And you've got to get that in 10 characters.

1044
01:12:58,521 --> 01:12:59,283
Speaker 0: And it's impossible.

1045
01:12:59,504 --> 01:13:00,587
Speaker 0: It's totally impossible.

1046
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:01,410
Speaker 0: You just can't do it.

1047
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,170
Speaker 0: So things have to go a lot of the time, unfortunately.

1048
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:15,750
Speaker 0: Unless you're working designs, which was another translation company that got a bit of slack because they went too far and would just start putting American pop culture into the translation system.

1049
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:27,230
Speaker 0: But what they would do was actually, they wouldn't just translate, they'd rewrite the code of the game and allow themselves more space and things like that, which was absolutely insane.

1050
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:35,310
Speaker 0: I mean, they went beyond the call of duty, but they went under because of it, because it took so long to release each game, was the trouble.

1051
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:45,030
Speaker 1: Do you think it would help if when they originally made the game, they just put all the different languages in there from the start, the same way they do with DVDs and such?

1052
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:50,790
Speaker 0: It would definitely help, but it takes so long to get the games out, I guess.

1053
01:13:52,010 --> 01:14:08,230
Speaker 0: Because, I mean, I could be wrong, but the way it seems to work is that, obviously, the Japanese first, and then that gets sent to a translator who does the English one, and then the English one is taken as a basis and all the European languages are done from that.

1054
01:14:08,872 --> 01:14:14,750
Speaker 0: So you can, I mean, it may be different with different companies, but that's been my experience.

1055
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:20,630
Speaker 0: And so if someone makes a mistake in the English, that mistake's passed down into all the European languages.

1056
01:14:21,552 --> 01:14:26,010
Speaker 0: But yeah, it would take ages to get all the languages in at once.

1057
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:33,870
Speaker 0: But that said, though, with Silent Hill 3 and Silent Hill 4, you've got Japanese and English as standard on the Japanese game.

1058
01:14:35,373 --> 01:14:37,630
Speaker 0: So yeah, definitely a couple of languages you can do.

1059
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:48,389
Speaker 1: Alright, so I don't know if you want to talk about this, but you do this professionally, do you want to talk about exactly which projects you've worked on, maybe some you're really proud of or anything like that?

1060
01:14:50,111 --> 01:15:04,170
Speaker 0: Right, the trouble we're working with games and novels like I do is that you've got your non-disclosure agreement which you have to sign, and so you can only really talk about it when the game or the novel is released on the shelves.

1061
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:17,990
Speaker 0: But especially with novels, I mean, the first novels I translated for Del Rey, or was it someone else, I think, the first ones I did like two years ago, and they're still not on the shelves.

1062
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

1063
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:31,179
Speaker 0: And I mean, recently Tokyopop removed pretty much almost their entire novel range from what I could see, which screwed a lot of translators over quite badly, actually.

1064
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:35,730
Speaker 0: I feel quite bad for a lot of agencies who were really, really screwed.

1065
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:44,069
Speaker 0: They had the carpet pulled from under them, some people had translated several books which will now never see the light of day, which is a real pisser.

1066
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:51,270
Speaker 0: But yeah, yeah, so a lot of the work I've done is still not out, is the trouble, so I can't really talk about it.

1067
01:15:52,472 --> 01:16:00,310
Speaker 1: Do you get, I don't want you to tell me how much you get paid, but do they pay you a flat fee, or do they pay you royalties, or how does that work?

1068
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:03,975
Speaker 0: With novels, it's per book, I've noticed.

1069
01:16:04,316 --> 01:16:10,728
Speaker 0: So, I don't know, your average Japanese light novel is about, what, 3,000 pages?

1070
01:16:12,871 --> 01:16:15,177
Speaker 0: And so, I think, is it three?

1071
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:16,702
Speaker 0: No, I'm talking about 300 pages.

1072
01:16:18,727 --> 01:16:19,710
Speaker 0: Terrible with maths.

1073
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:24,141
Speaker 0: The other day, someone contacted me for a job and asked me, "What are your

1074
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:24,461
Speaker 0: rates?".

1075
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:27,529
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Oh, it's this much per

1076
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:27,829
Speaker 0: word.".

1077
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:32,529
Speaker 0: And they sent back and said, "That's 300 times more than what we pay our normal

1078
01:16:32,549 --> 01:16:32,750
Speaker 0: people.".

1079
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:38,168
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Oh, sorry, I added an extra zero and the decimal point was in the wrong

1080
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:38,469
Speaker 0: place.".

1081
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:43,830
Speaker 0: So, I'm a complete moron, I'm surprised I get any jobs at all after some of the stuff that I've pulled.

1082
01:16:44,471 --> 01:16:48,050
Speaker 1: So, you work on your own, you don't have an agent or anything?

1083
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:58,830
Speaker 0: I work for agencies, actually, because I've got my details on translation websites like Prose and Translators Cafe and things like that.

1084
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:03,209
Speaker 0: So, people see that and they see that I specialize in games and novels and they contact me.

1085
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:09,530
Speaker 0: And if you get a good working relationship with a company going, then, I mean, that's excellent, really.

1086
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:22,730
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a company called Local Soft in Spain who are really, really good because they won't just send you the text to translate, they'll send you scans, all the scans you need, all of the glossaries and terminologies.

1087
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:33,870
Speaker 0: If it's a game for the DS, you know, you'll get a glossary of every single DS part, the names of every component in the DS, so that you can make sure your translation's, like, spot-on perfect.

1088
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:36,946
Speaker 1: So, you get to see some games, like, before they come out.

1089
01:17:37,046 --> 01:17:37,730
Speaker 1: That must be pretty cool.

1090
01:17:38,471 --> 01:17:39,382
Speaker 0: I don't, actually.

1091
01:17:39,403 --> 01:17:39,950
Speaker 0: That's the trouble.

1092
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:46,970
Speaker 0: This is a lot of the problem with translation is that you'll get the manual, but generally, you're just seeing the text.

1093
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:49,069
Speaker 0: But you're not seeing what's happening on the screen.

1094
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:58,130
Speaker 0: And so, a lot of bad translations stem from that, from the fact that you can see someone saying something, but you don't know what's actually happening is the trouble.

1095
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:14,230
Speaker 0: So, I mean, ideally, and people like Jeremy Blaustein and, like, you know, the real big names in translation industry, I'm guessing that they are playing the beta test versions of the games as they translate, and that's what you need to do, really.

1096
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:22,090
Speaker 0: And I know that my friend Ben, for some companies, they actually send him the game as well, which he plays and translates as he goes along.

1097
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:27,049
Speaker 0: But generally, I'm doing instruction manuals a lot of the time, and so I don't really need to.

1098
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:43,350
Speaker 0: But Mario games, I've done a few Mario games, and mainly instruction manuals for them, but they're a bit of a bastard, because, obviously, every single character name, apart from Mario and Luigi and Peach, is different in America to Japan.

1099
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:46,008
Speaker 2: So, what are you working on right now?

1100
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:54,770
Speaker 0: I'm doing a Doctor Who animation at the moment, which I'm doing myself, so it's taking ages and ages.

1101
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,574
Speaker 0: And that's about it, really.

1102
01:18:57,795 --> 01:19:08,110
Speaker 0: It's all on my DeviantArt page, which all the people at ConceptArt, all the real artists, will completely slag me off for saying that I've got a DeviantArt page.

1103
01:19:08,672 --> 01:19:10,650
Speaker 1: What's the URL of your DeviantArt page?

1104
01:19:11,312 --> 01:19:11,934
Speaker 0: Let me have a look.

1105
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:16,289
Speaker 0: Actually, if you just go to Google and put in "Paul Otaking Johnson," it's the first thing that comes up.

1106
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,849
Speaker 0: Actually, the documentary might be the first thing that comes up now.

1107
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:24,730
Speaker 0: And various websites, like "Otaking is a gigantic faggot," and stuff like that.

1108
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:27,609
Speaker 2: That's actually what I'm looking at right now, as I've searched on Google.

1109
01:19:28,134 --> 01:19:28,430
Speaker 1: Really?

1110
01:19:28,891 --> 01:19:31,249
Speaker 2: That is, in fact, the fourth from the top.

1111
01:19:32,471 --> 01:19:32,880
Speaker 0: Indeed, yeah.

1112
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:39,367
Speaker 1: Man, we've been doing this show for years, trying to get some hate, and you get it so instantly.

1113
01:19:39,548 --> 01:19:40,030
Speaker 1: It's not fair.

1114
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:41,117
Speaker 0: I know, yeah, yeah.

1115
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,130
Speaker 0: My five seconds of fame.

1116
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,473
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing, though.

1117
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:47,522
Speaker 0: A lot of people are like, "Oh, he's just a gigantic troll.

1118
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:50,290
Speaker 0: Oh, he's just doing it to get some attention," and whatnot.

1119
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:51,656
Speaker 0: And it's not at all.

1120
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,109
Speaker 0: I've had five seconds of fame from it.

1121
01:19:54,632 --> 01:19:57,530
Speaker 0: I've had 40,000 views on my video, and then it stopped.

1122
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:00,810
Speaker 0: And that's all the fame I expect to get.

1123
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:06,430
Speaker 0: I don't expect my name to be remembered or anything, and I don't expect to change anyone's mind, to be honest.

1124
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:12,010
Speaker 0: Because no fan-subber is going to change the way they do things because of watching me ranting for half an hour.

1125
01:20:13,112 --> 01:20:16,050
Speaker 0: So I basically did it for myself, I think, really.

1126
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:37,008
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think any fan-subber will change their mind, but someone like me who didn't really think of the issue at all... It wasn't... I mean, dubs and subs I thought about, but bad fan-subs versus good fan-subs was not... I didn't really think about it very much, but your video came along, and now suddenly I'm all on your side, like, "Oh,

1127
01:20:37,028 --> 01:20:37,309
Speaker 1: yeah.".

1128
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:39,930
Speaker 1: So you've done something.

1129
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:47,470
Speaker 2: Maybe there'll be some sort of movement eventually of awesome fan-subbers who decide to follow your way and make good fan-subs of new shows.

1130
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:54,530
Speaker 0: Well, I think it is worth mentioning that a lot of the comments I got said you've deliberately picked bad examples.

1131
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:55,476
Speaker 1: That is true.

1132
01:20:55,879 --> 01:20:57,270
Speaker 1: I do have to agree with that.

1133
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:07,050
Speaker 1: But I think by showing the bad examples, like the worst of the worst, it's like I see aspects of those bad examples in, you know, the average fan-sub.

1134
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:08,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

1135
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,169
Speaker 1: And they sort of stick out.

1136
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:12,201
Speaker 0: Well, I just grabbed what I could, was the thing.

1137
01:21:12,282 --> 01:21:16,176
Speaker 0: I didn't have the time to... I mean, it took long enough just to do the opening sequence.

1138
01:21:16,216 --> 01:21:21,110
Speaker 0: I didn't have the time to actually download a hundred episodes of One Piece and choose the worst ones.

1139
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,709
Speaker 0: I just grabbed what I got, and that was what I ended up with.

1140
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:33,130
Speaker 0: So I actually hope that what they're saying is true and that I ended up with bad examples and that there are actually much, much better fan-subs out there.

1141
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:37,745
Speaker 0: I'd hate to think that the ones that I showed are what all the fan-subs are like.

1142
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:39,390
Speaker 0: That'd just be terrible.

1143
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:45,870
Speaker 1: No, I think in most fan-subs I watch, there'll be like one or two parts that are as bad as the examples.

1144
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:49,389
Speaker 1: But for the most part, they're pretty much just, you know, normal-ish.

1145
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,505
Speaker 1: You know, they're not great, but they're okay.

1146
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:52,091
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1147
01:21:52,555 --> 01:21:53,059
Speaker 0: Okay.

1148
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:55,251
Speaker 2: All right.

1149
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:58,084
Speaker 2: Well, thank you very much for being on the show with us.

1150
01:21:58,124 --> 01:21:59,490
Speaker 2: This was most enlightening.

1151
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:00,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is pretty awesome.

1152
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:01,071
Speaker 0: No problem.

1153
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:11,110
Speaker 0: It's the first interview I've ever done, so I probably should have had some vodka before, but I had a Coke instead, and hopefully I haven't made myself look too much of an asshat.

1154
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,130
Speaker 0: If "asshat" is even a real word.

1155
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:14,930
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a word.

1156
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:15,648
Speaker 2: Most definitely.

1157
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:16,209
Speaker 0: It's a word.

1158
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,860
Speaker 2: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1159
