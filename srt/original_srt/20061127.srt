1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,718
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 27th.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,608
Speaker 1: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:20,930
Speaker 1: tonight We're back from the holidays to continue our ongoing series on how computers work with the second part of hard drives.

4
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,187
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,342
Speaker 1: Well after an unseasonably short hiatus, we're back.

6
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:29,285
Speaker 1: We're bad.

7
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,790
Speaker 2: That wasn't a short hiatus.

8
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,004
Speaker 2: That was like the longest hiatus in a long time.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:40,026
Speaker 2: It was two episodes But there are many days that we wouldn't have made an episode so it felt long.

10
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:41,050
Speaker 1: it wasn't long at all.

11
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,677
Speaker 1: I only took a couple days off work.

12
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,122
Speaker 1: We didn't really miss much.

13
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:47,849
Speaker 2: I felt like a big long time.

14
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:49,256
Speaker 1: Well, it really was.

15
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,181
Speaker 2: I forget how to make a show.

16
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:50,844
Speaker 2: What do we say now?

17
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:51,628
Speaker 1: I don't know.

18
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:56,430
Speaker 1: Maybe we should pull all fast karate style and just kind of ramble for a while with a lot of pauses.

19
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:59,361
Speaker 2: Screw that if we're not gonna do something important up here.

20
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,385
Speaker 2: I'm going to play some Zelda.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,143
Speaker 1: I Haven't even played Zelda yet.

22
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:03,890
Speaker 1: I haven't had time.

23
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:05,140
Speaker 2: You shouldn't know.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,450
Speaker 2: I gotta say I can play more.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,590
Speaker 1: I gotta say I've gotten all the tiredness out of my veins by going out of town for those four days.

26
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,480
Speaker 2: Yeah, I definitely do not have tiredness.

27
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:17,116
Speaker 2: Thanks to much sleeping Man, did I sleep?

28
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:17,799
Speaker 2: Holy crap.

29
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,265
Speaker 1: I didn't sleep so much.

30
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,169
Speaker 1: I did stuff.

31
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:23,318
Speaker 2: Yeah, I also did stuff like play Zelda.

32
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,986
Speaker 2: I think I clocked 16 hours now.

33
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:26,427
Speaker 2: I don't know.

34
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:31,030
Speaker 1: Whoa I haven't clocked 16 hours in a game since Advance Wars DS.

35
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:36,476
Speaker 2: But think about this 16 hours not even halfway done Badasses.

36
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:37,505
Speaker 2: Oh, right.

37
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:38,070
Speaker 1: Think about that.

38
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,535
Speaker 1: You're already on track.

39
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:46,730
Speaker 1: if the game is only twice as long if you've played so far that's still Final Fantasy 4 worth of content.

40
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:47,874
Speaker 2: Well think about this.

41
00:01:47,994 --> 00:02:00,048
Speaker 2: if this game is the same size as Wind Waker and I know it's much larger than Wind Waker was Then at this point I would be Like slightly less than half done with Wind Waker.

42
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,430
Speaker 2: So I'm probably slightly less than a third done with this game.

43
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,902
Speaker 2: I'm guessing it could be even bigger than I think though and thus it'll be huge.

44
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,769
Speaker 2: take me days to win anyway Yep.

45
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,119
Speaker 1: So what do we got in the news?

46
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:22,774
Speaker 1: since we'll skip right past all the fun Anecdotes from the weekend and save them for I don't know a special maybe a Thursday about Halloween or Thanksgiving or Christmas or holidays Or something.

47
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:26,490
Speaker 2: most of it was we related except for a few other things.

48
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,337
Speaker 2: We'll probably talk about a lot about it tomorrow.

49
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:31,585
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of interesting fun in Rochester.

50
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:32,227
Speaker 2: Yeah.

51
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,190
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure you did.

52
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:35,698
Speaker 2: So technology it's Monday, right?

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,663
Speaker 2: Yeah, cool.

54
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:43,568
Speaker 2: So Mark shuttle worth He's that super rich guy who South African and he runs Ubuntu.

55
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,670
Speaker 2: Well, the company that runs Ubuntu is canonical, right?

56
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,689
Speaker 2: So Novell has that deal with Microsoft that recently went down.

57
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:59,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one that there is a lot of uproar over for various reasons that we won't really get into.

58
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:06,430
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically Novell got a bunch of money from Microsoft and an exchange for that.

59
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:19,169
Speaker 2: They got some sort of Linux deal because Novell owns SUSE Linux and stuff and it's crazy and There's issues in that this might violate the GPL and such and such and such.

60
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:28,108
Speaker 2: So that means that SUSE might be like a dead distribution because Microsoft has got all their fingers in it and whatnot.

61
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:38,230
Speaker 1: supposedly I hope we don't have too many listeners out there who use it, but I've considered it to be not dead But really unnecessary for a long time anyway.

62
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:47,670
Speaker 2: Well, SUSE has classically been sort of like this corporate desktop type of distribution and you know Recently, it's actually got some good stuff.

63
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:58,016
Speaker 2: It was one of the first distributions to have like the XGL stuff going on because that was developed by Novell and has other Few nice things, you know It still has that Yast thing going on.

64
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:06,479
Speaker 2: that makes a lot of things easy to configure like connecting to Outlook exchange servers Yeah, but I mean those share in terms of a corporate desktop.

65
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:11,477
Speaker 1: most corporations I've seen if they use Linux at all They've been using Red Hat Enterprise.

66
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:20,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, or now a lot of people are actually looking at Ubuntu Ubuntu yeah, but it you know, it's classically been that distribution anyway, yeah like in the 90s.

67
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,197
Speaker 2: No, it's gotten a lot of play recently.

68
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:28,786
Speaker 2: Anyway, the point is because of this deal with Microsoft There's a stigma around SUSE.

69
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:41,070
Speaker 2: So shuttleworth Put out an email on the open SUSE Developer mailing list and he says, you know, I read the email most of it and it says, you know, there's this issue.

70
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:50,276
Speaker 2: You I know this is probably be a little controversial whatever but if any of you you know Don't want to develop for open SUSE anymore.

71
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:58,640
Speaker 2: We're having some meetings over at Ubuntu to you know, get new developers on board Feel free, you know, it was.

72
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,850
Speaker 2: it was a really nice professional well-written email.

73
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:07,030
Speaker 2: We'd read the email on the air, but it's really long and boring and you can go read it yourself.

74
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,761
Speaker 2: But it didn't seem you know bad to me.

75
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,790
Speaker 1: now, in fact, let's try a little thought experiment.

76
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,830
Speaker 1: Hey Scott, if you want to develop for Ubuntu, I think you should if you might be a cool thing.

77
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:19,474
Speaker 2: I don't know.

78
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,497
Speaker 1: busy, huh?

79
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,130
Speaker 1: That was easy enough and Scott didn't have any sort of outrage.

80
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:31,967
Speaker 1: There's the Linux community isn't beating down my door Pissed off about the fact that I asked Scott that if he wanted to I'd like him to do stuff for Ubuntu.

81
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,977
Speaker 1: now What did the Linux community do?

82
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:39,694
Speaker 2: well, first of all, the open SUSE people were like, yeah What the hell.

83
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,888
Speaker 2: you poaching developers bla bla bla.

84
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:47,230
Speaker 2: It's interesting how everyone in the community seems intent on dividing it committing suicide by infighting.

85
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,633
Speaker 2: Congratulations, Mr.

86
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:49,135
Speaker 2: Shutterworth.

87
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,567
Speaker 2: You're doing a fine job of doing Microsoft's FUD work for them.

88
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:53,350
Speaker 1: Wait a minute now.

89
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:58,270
Speaker 1: They're mad about dividing it by infighting and their response is infighting exactly.

90
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:06,430
Speaker 2: Not only that but Ubuntu developers were pissed off, dude They said stuff like what mark did is simply not done.

91
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:12,828
Speaker 1: Bob I didn't know there were unwritten rules as to what you're allowed to email to people.

92
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:13,751
Speaker 2: Yeah All right.

93
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,302
Speaker 2: I think the problem here is clearly that Mark Shutterworth.

94
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:21,493
Speaker 2: He thinks like we do he's a normal smart Intelligent guy.

95
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:25,969
Speaker 2: that's why he has lots and lots of money and he went to outer space and he made Ubuntu.

96
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:31,044
Speaker 1: Now note that one does not necessarily form the other.

97
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:40,683
Speaker 1: no, not necessarily Pointing out some interesting correlation here, but he didn't find Ubuntu on the moon.

98
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:47,200
Speaker 0: No, he did not find Ubuntu on the moon Although I wouldn't be surprised if he told us that he did.

99
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:49,817
Speaker 1: But yeah, he does.

100
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:57,378
Speaker 1: the kind of things like if we were dealing with Linux distros We'd make a lot of the decisions like he makes in terms of you know Make it actually easy to use.

101
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,930
Speaker 1: hide the stuff that people don't give a shit about.

102
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,343
Speaker 1: Make it so that humans can use it not just Linux nerds.

103
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:04,628
Speaker 2: who cares about?

104
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,661
Speaker 2: you know Including crap that Linux nerds might not like.

105
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:13,161
Speaker 2: make a deal with Firefox Like you can keep the Firefox icon instead of going to ice weasel.

106
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,046
Speaker 2: make deal with Nvidia.

107
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,310
Speaker 2: to you include the driver.

108
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:23,510
Speaker 1: I mean your pure Linux that doesn't have a tainted kernel and can't play back MP3s is fine and dandy in your Linux world.

109
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:36,810
Speaker 1: But real people and I include most people who use Linux who are not Linux zealots in that Don't care if the fact that technically having the thing to decode mp3s violates intellectual property somewhere.

110
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:37,187
Speaker 1: Yeah.

111
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:48,790
Speaker 2: So it seems like more and more that the people who are hurting Linux the most these days are the crazy zealot Developers who insist on everything being free and they turn

112
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,010
Speaker 0: normal

113
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,069
Speaker 2: perfectly

114
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,612
Speaker 1: Chromulant

115
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:58,800
Speaker 2: chromulant happenings into huge Controversies and flame wars and blah

116
00:07:58,981 --> 00:07:59,563
Speaker 0: like they still

117
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,331
Speaker 2: think that it's 1995.

118
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:05,002
Speaker 1: It's like with the whole GPL v2 versus GPL v3 issue.

119
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:11,010
Speaker 1: where it's there is I mean there's reasonable debate But all you ever see people arguing about is crazy.

120
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:17,163
Speaker 1: I won't use the version 3 because it's the end of the world and it's the most horrible thing I've ever seen and it violates everything.

121
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:17,767
Speaker 1: I believe it.

122
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:25,497
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually the crazy people are usually on the side of the three and I won't use 2 because it violates everything.

123
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:26,219
Speaker 1: I believe it.

124
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:26,720
Speaker 2: Yeah.

125
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:27,382
Speaker 2: Yeah.

126
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:36,350
Speaker 1: Well, I'm actually for version 3 But that was after hearing smart people talk about it for I heard smart people talk about it and I used to be against it.

127
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,717
Speaker 2: Just a version 3 blue, you know sucks.

128
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,025
Speaker 2: after hearing smart people talk about it.

129
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:46,470
Speaker 2: I'm kind of like alright I understand it now and I'm not as against it as I was before.

130
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:52,470
Speaker 2: But at the same time I'm against like a couple parts of it, you know, but the rest of it is great.

131
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,469
Speaker 2: They should make one doesn't have those two parts.

132
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,780
Speaker 1: Well, you could make one that doesn't have those two parts.

133
00:08:56,901 --> 00:09:00,229
Speaker 2: I could fairly easily very easily But that's besides the point.

134
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:11,829
Speaker 2: The point is here's an example of crazy Linux zealots hurting Linux and making a ruckus for no reason and Mark Shutterworth is awesome and Novelles and Microsoft not so good.

135
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:16,275
Speaker 2: Ubuntu very very good - very very good Right.

136
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:21,590
Speaker 1: So the news I've dredged up here I bring it up because it's on dig and it's all over the internet again.

137
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:29,319
Speaker 1: But I've seen this before and I'm sure many of our older listeners may have seen it before too And in fact, it might not actually be true.

138
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,070
Speaker 1: There's really a decent chance that this is entirely fabricated.

139
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:41,490
Speaker 1: The reason I bring it up 80% chance of being fake whether or not this is this specific incident is fabricated.

140
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:59,330
Speaker 1: it's a good talking point because this is happening all over the United States of America and aside from all the recent stories and anecdotes and examples of it that I could think of I Actually have had this happen to me and my brother numerous times throughout primary and secondary school.

141
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,507
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and I believe Scott is that it happened to him too.

142
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:21,236
Speaker 1: Yes The basic story here is it's a note from a teacher explaining why a student was given detention And the reason was that the student Insisted that the teacher was wrong in claiming that a kilometer is longer than a mile Which is patently untrue.

143
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:27,130
Speaker 1: a mile is much longer than a kilometer now because the student had the audacity to question the teacher.

144
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:31,470
Speaker 1: The student was given a detention because you shouldn't resist what you're being taught.

145
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,470
Speaker 1: You should just follow whatever the teacher says and not bring up dissent because it's disruptive.

146
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:46,019
Speaker 2: now that's a horrible thing, but Intelligent person can see obviously why it is horrible.

147
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,506
Speaker 2: if you don't see why that's obviously horrible.

148
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,815
Speaker 0: You're not intelligent Now.

149
00:10:50,896 --> 00:11:03,424
Speaker 1: I wouldn't care if this was an isolated incident But it seems that this happens on a semi regular basis and that there are a lot of people out there teaching children Who are either not qualified to teach children because they don't actually know what they're teaching

150
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:04,347
Speaker 2: or they don't care

151
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:11,950
Speaker 1: or even worse They may know enough to teach but when they make a mistake They refuse to admit it and instead take it out on the children.

152
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:16,925
Speaker 2: The problem is is there aren't enough good teachers in total.

153
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:29,410
Speaker 2: if you took everyone on in the whole country even the whole world who had the Abilities and skills to teach well without these kind of stupid problems you would not have enough people to teach all the children.

154
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:32,787
Speaker 2: So there's gonna be bad teachers and shit like this is gonna happen.

155
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:33,250
Speaker 1: I don't know.

156
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:39,671
Speaker 1: I think I could be a pretty good teacher as long as with the subject I know stuff about and the kids were at least over the age of 14.

157
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:41,358
Speaker 0: I could do but I can't do this.

158
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,325
Speaker 2: I think I could I ever tried.

159
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:44,730
Speaker 2: I've done some summer camp action.

160
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:55,290
Speaker 1: Yeah I've taught like one day session but IBM used to do a lot of stuff where kids would come in and I've taught like one Day sessions about you know, babe basic basic computer things and I think I did a good job.

161
00:11:55,531 --> 00:12:00,690
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I think the point is if I saw we might be able to there aren't enough people.

162
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:06,168
Speaker 2: Yeah well and and a lot of the people who can Aren't going to because they have better things to be doing.

163
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:10,090
Speaker 1: See it just this really hit close to home because when I was a kid, I was in elementary school.

164
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,958
Speaker 1: My brother was also in elementary school.

165
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:22,590
Speaker 1: He came home from school one day crying about class and apparently what had happened was he was in a class and They were talking about you know time hours of the day.

166
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,251
Speaker 1: it was like first or second grade and the textbook had a typo in it stating that 12 a.m.

167
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,398
Speaker 1: Was noon and 12 p.m.

168
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:31,961
Speaker 1: Was midnight.

169
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:39,229
Speaker 2: Now it should just go somewhere with this 24-hour o'clock wouldn't have this problem.

170
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:42,569
Speaker 1: now My brother, you know raised his hand and said but that's not true.

171
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:43,914
Speaker 1: 12 p.m.

172
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:46,122
Speaker 1: Is when I go eat lunch and 1201 p.m.

173
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:59,637
Speaker 1: Is in the afternoon and the teacher berated him in front of the class for contradicting the textbook that he could see right in front of him that everyone knew was right and he was pretty much ridiculed for The rest of the day by everyone in his class mmm, and then he comes home.

174
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:11,170
Speaker 1: now, my mother was furious and she went back to the school and The teacher was actually angry and defended her position to my mother not the position of ridiculing my brother.

175
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,524
Speaker 1: Not even that she defended the fact that 12 noon was 12 a.m.

176
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:25,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mother went and found other teachers that were in the school working dragged them into the room Got them to explain it to her and she still wouldn't relent.

177
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,996
Speaker 0: See, this is the time now I could.

178
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,150
Speaker 2: I think I'm correct in saying there aren't enough teachers.

179
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:40,950
Speaker 2: so we obviously if we want every kid to have a teacher and not to have Giant giant classrooms with thousands of kids or to teach every kid with some sort of matrix like machine.

180
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:47,490
Speaker 2: We're gonna need to let people like this teach at some point, but they're not a problem If we keep them in line.

181
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:59,229
Speaker 2: We have enough people to be principals of every school and those principals need to not only fire these teachers Not only public humiliate these teachers not only to make sure they're never allowed to teach again.

182
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:10,230
Speaker 2: make sure they I don't know end up homeless or Put them in jail or insane asylums or make sure they're never allowed near children ever or I don't know something really really horrible.

183
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:11,859
Speaker 2: Send them back to school.

184
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,910
Speaker 2: They go back to kindergarten so they can learn it all again.

185
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:21,990
Speaker 2: I mean if you're like 34 years old and a first-grade teacher and you can't teach first grade properly Obviously you need to go back to first grade now.

186
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,667
Speaker 1: There's a difference between not being able to teach first grade because you have trouble dealing with children.

187
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:32,462
Speaker 1: I Generally do not like being around small children.

188
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,690
Speaker 2: It depends on the small children.

189
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,782
Speaker 1: Well, you're an individual small child.

190
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,110
Speaker 1: I'm fine with a small group of them.

191
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:58,327
Speaker 1: I'm fine with a large group of well-behaved ones I'm fine with but a large group of semi unruly to feral children I cannot deal with and when when Lisa and I back at RIT anime had to put on a little presentation for like 20 of these feral children from some local elementary school.

192
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:01,017
Speaker 1: I Wanted to snap all their little necks.

193
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, just it was.

194
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,490
Speaker 1: what do you do when you tell a kid be quiet?

195
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,142
Speaker 1: He says you can't do anything to me and runs out of the room screaming.

196
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:10,845
Speaker 1: you say alright, let him go I had to go get him.

197
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,479
Speaker 0: That's the thing from being a camp counselor.

198
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:19,990
Speaker 0: many many times like four or five times, you know It's pretty awesome and most of the kids are also awesome.

199
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:23,773
Speaker 0: But there's always one or two kids in the cabin or group or whatever You've got.

200
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,923
Speaker 0: that are the trouble-making bad kids.

201
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:27,270
Speaker 0: then they they ruin your day.

202
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:33,930
Speaker 0: And if you got rid of those kids like really I know for a fact if those kids are out of the equation Everything is awesome.

203
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:43,138
Speaker 0: because there would be days like at a day camp where the one trouble-making kid out of ten wouldn't show up and you would just Relax, and it would be like hang with your friends.

204
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:55,269
Speaker 0: only all your friends were really small and couldn't talk about adult topics And they could play a really bad game of Red Rover and you had to go easy on him, but other than that Everything was cool.

205
00:15:55,952 --> 00:16:00,026
Speaker 0: So I think the trick is we just had to weed those bad kids out of society.

206
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,150
Speaker 0: put them with the teachers.

207
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,672
Speaker 0: You don't know.

208
00:16:01,672 --> 00:16:02,536
Speaker 0: 12 a.m.

209
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:03,300
Speaker 0: For 12 p.m.

210
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,384
Speaker 0: All in the same room.

211
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,610
Speaker 0: Just on the other side of the country.

212
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,330
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll make a state for those people called, Texas.

213
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:15,001
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is if you can't teach because you just can't deal with kids That's one thing and that's something you can learn or try or get help with.

214
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:21,230
Speaker 1: if you can't teach first grade because you don't know The material well, how the hell did you become an adult?

215
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,329
Speaker 1: How did you live your life not knowing those things?

216
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:34,427
Speaker 0: You know There are people out there on the street probably living really close to us who don't know things like that Well considering their living considering the median income of our area.

217
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:45,940
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, I mean I remember once in seventh grade when a teacher was teaching some bullshit about how to do graphs and x and y-axis And coordinates and she didn't know what she was talking about.

218
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,028
Speaker 1: and I kept interrupting her like that's not hot.

219
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:49,736
Speaker 1: That's not right That's not right.

220
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:52,390
Speaker 1: I was correcting her and finally she lost it.

221
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,034
Speaker 1: She says well if you are so smart Then you can teach the class.

222
00:16:56,075 --> 00:17:06,901
Speaker 1: and she stormed out and I got up and I taught the goddamn class and she came back in like a minute later saw what I was doing and Sent me to the principal's office to try to get me expelled.

223
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,849
Speaker 1: and she's yelling and yelling and she leaves.

224
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,164
Speaker 1: I'm sitting there with the principal and he basically says I'm not gonna punish you.

225
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:15,030
Speaker 1: I can't believe this happened.

226
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:16,736
Speaker 1: I don't know what to say.

227
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,982
Speaker 1: Just try not to tick her off.

228
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,609
Speaker 1: I'll see if I can get you into a better class.

229
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,281
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I see that's my kind of problem with it.

230
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:25,565
Speaker 0: Well, I'm Taylor.

231
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:26,849
Speaker 0: God so knows all about this shit.

232
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:28,277
Speaker 1: I mean, what was he gonna do?

233
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:28,679
Speaker 1: It's not like.

234
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,146
Speaker 1: there was an advanced class.

235
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:31,010
Speaker 1: It was middle school.

236
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:33,450
Speaker 1: There was that class and the class for slow kids.

237
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,474
Speaker 0: Yeah This all goes back to a giant discussion about tenure and all that jazz how there needs to be some more Competition among teachers.

238
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:40,836
Speaker 0: you should.

239
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:45,250
Speaker 0: you need to be able to fire them and hire them willy-nilly like it can every other profession.

240
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,740
Speaker 0: They need to be held to a higher standard etc.

241
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's tough to do because how do you set a stand?

242
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

243
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:55,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it goes into a big thing Like police where you need police.

244
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,870
Speaker 0: police are good, but there's a few bad police and it makes all the police look bad.

245
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,145
Speaker 0: You know, of course, I think there's actually a lot of bad police like.

246
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:03,270
Speaker 0: there's a lot of bad teachers.

247
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,634
Speaker 0: I say 50% maybe.

248
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:06,841
Speaker 1: well, you know the old saying it's 99% of cops.

249
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:07,543
Speaker 1: They give 1% of bad name.

250
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:14,330
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, no offense to any police officers listening, but you're part of the problem.

251
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:20,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Sorry, I that this kind of an inside joke over the weekend.

252
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:28,603
Speaker 1: I got in a whole bunch of fun arguments and some one thing that came up was United States traffic law and traffic enforcement.

253
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is kind of a hot button.

254
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:43,096
Speaker 0: That's really the only time I hate police is either if you know, they're stepping over the line in when they're doing you know something involving civil rights, like when they electro they Taser that kid at UCLA.

255
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:52,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, or like a Rodney King beating type thing or if they're Enforcing laws that I don't think are just it's alright.

256
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:59,750
Speaker 1: We got jury nullification jury nullification and we also would probably be better off doing an episode about this instead of just a news.

257
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:12,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let's go to things today things of the day My thing of the day is hot.

258
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:14,039
Speaker 1: Well, you want to start with that then?

259
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:19,060
Speaker 0: So it was Thanksgiving weekend, you know, I don't watch television.

260
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:33,225
Speaker 0: We don't have cable television and one of the few few things I miss from not having that television is watching live Sporting events and I watched a little bit of footballs and I went to a minor league hockey game and such over the weekend But I came back.

261
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:37,820
Speaker 0: I found this football video on YouTube now for our international listeners.

262
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,373
Speaker 0: We're not talking about soccer or football.

263
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:49,085
Speaker 0: We're talking about the football American Yes, the football that we enjoy on Thanksgiving Day, which is a holiday You do not celebrate at least.

264
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:49,727
Speaker 0: I don't think you do.

265
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,614
Speaker 1: a lot of people celebrate Thanksgiving.

266
00:19:51,654 --> 00:20:01,300
Speaker 0: In fact outside the United States Yes, really they celebrate very similar holidays around the same time and a lot of those usually just like harvest whatever festival or whatever.

267
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,456
Speaker 1: So I know some of them are kind of just based not really based on but just concurrent to the American holiday.

268
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:17,660
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, this is a 1994 high school football I assume championship game because they're playing in Texas Stadium, which is where the Dallas Cowboys play.

269
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,820
Speaker 0: So if you're a high school team playing in the NFL field, this has to be an important game of some sort.

270
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:29,743
Speaker 0: At least I think that's the field because there's a whole lot of empty seats and there's a big Dallas Cowboy star on the field And it's huh.

271
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,190
Speaker 0: It's a really nice field.

272
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:35,986
Speaker 1: No, they're the Iowa Wiccans, yeah.

273
00:20:36,046 --> 00:20:54,964
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's a game versus Plano East Against John Tyler two high schools and the score is 41 to 17 And Plano East is losing and Plano East is the team with the darker colored Uniforms.

274
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:56,852
Speaker 1: now how many minutes are left to play?

275
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 0: three minutes to go?

276
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,620
Speaker 0: There are three minutes left on the clock in this game.

277
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:22,900
Speaker 0: Now if you know football American football one of the key factors in American football is clock Management and it's very important, you know, if you leave like, you know, ten seconds on the clock here 20 seconds to the clock there It's enough time for someone to make a play, you know, someone will you know, they'll do a play They'll throw the ball out of bounds to get the clock stopped all kinds of stuff like that.

278
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:29,420
Speaker 1: Yep And by the same token you might be behind and you got to make that clock stop whenever possible to leave time.

279
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,547
Speaker 0: You only have a certain number of timeouts.

280
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:32,972
Speaker 0: You can use all kinds of stuff.

281
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:35,019
Speaker 0: So with three minutes left to go.

282
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,567
Speaker 0: Plano East is down 41 to 17.

283
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:43,707
Speaker 0: So with three touchdowns Let's see one touchdown is 21 to touch.

284
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:47,720
Speaker 0: the four touchdowns would be needed for them to win and get ahead.

285
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:50,832
Speaker 0: A field goal is three points.

286
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,100
Speaker 0: a touchdown is six points.

287
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,937
Speaker 0: But if you get a touchdown, you're pretty much guaranteed to get an extra point.

288
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:55,460
Speaker 0: So it's seven.

289
00:21:55,902 --> 00:21:58,055
Speaker 0: So yeah, seven times four be thirty six.

290
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:03,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay No, seven fourteen twenty seven times four is twenty eight and seventeen is more than forty one.

291
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:10,880
Speaker 1: now much like a lot of FARC headlines We wouldn't be giving you this thing of the day if there weren't a reason for it to be a thing of the day.

292
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Speaker 0: Yes, as you watch these four minutes of American football, you will see perhaps the greatest comeback in all of football history.

293
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:22,880
Speaker 0: Mostly obviously this happens because it's amateur high school football players.

294
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they give the onside kick more than one so that never works.

295
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:34,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, you hardly ever see an onside kick in the NFL and when someone tries it it's like a crazy emergency in the playoffs Or they have no other choice.

296
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:43,800
Speaker 1: Hardly ever work an onside kick in American real Professional football is like seeing one of those fake outs try to happen in like a Major League Baseball game.

297
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:44,478
Speaker 1: It just doesn't happen.

298
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:52,328
Speaker 0: Yeah The reason a lot of the the fake trick plays don't happen in the NFL is actually because a lot of those Formations are illegal now.

299
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:59,540
Speaker 0: I've got opinions on that that are separate, you know I think that any formation where all your guys are on your side of the line of scrimmage should be okay.

300
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:02,008
Speaker 0: But that's besides the point.

301
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,860
Speaker 0: the point is this is an amazing four minutes of football.

302
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:11,743
Speaker 0: I think that this might actually be above the level of that hockey game of RIT.

303
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:15,500
Speaker 1: it might be and that was one of the greatest sporting event experiences of my life.

304
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:22,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, so watch this and even if you don't understand American football you'll understand what's going on.

305
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,812
Speaker 1: There's two commentators pretty much just yelling and screaming and they're there.

306
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:31,615
Speaker 0: half the video half the entertainment of this video Is those two guys good gosh almighty good God Almighty.

307
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:35,352
Speaker 1: I think he says gosh Oh, he says God near the end when he gets really excited.

308
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:37,160
Speaker 1: He says I think I wet myself.

309
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:41,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, watch it all the way to the end It is.

310
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:46,496
Speaker 0: don't stop watching this because it amazes you like three or four times.

311
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:46,878
Speaker 0: You'll go.

312
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:47,620
Speaker 0: Whoa.

313
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,139
Speaker 1: But then at the end you'll go whoa again.

314
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,878
Speaker 0: Yeah There's one final whoa.

315
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,880
Speaker 1: So let the video play to the end and don't worry about it being boring or anything.

316
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,420
Speaker 1: They cut out everything but the pertinent action.

317
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:01,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, you all you see are basically the big plays.

318
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:04,827
Speaker 0: if there are any small plays we might miss them But I don't think there were small plays.

319
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:06,195
Speaker 0: I think it's every play is huge.

320
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:10,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, they just cut out You know the setup time between the hikes and all that.

321
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,686
Speaker 0: Yeah Between the dance.

322
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:13,150
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,298
Speaker 1: Well, you know when they hike it.

324
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, because when I was a little kid and we played football for the Intellivision -

325
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:20,679
Speaker 0: yeah

326
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:29,720
Speaker 1: We would always say it's your turn to hike and then you hit the button And they had this little wave of a guide it would go like and then the game would start.

327
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,068
Speaker 2: And now I have Madden Wii.

328
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:33,375
Speaker 1: Yeah Madden Wii.

329
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,220
Speaker 1: I still gotta play that.

330
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,991
Speaker 1: I haven't had a chance to really play the Wii except excite truck.

331
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:39,300
Speaker 2: It's kind of complicated Madden Wii.

332
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:41,066
Speaker 2: Let's go play Wii after you do the show.

333
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:41,628
Speaker 1: Yeah.

334
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:41,969
Speaker 1: All right.

335
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:43,013
Speaker 0: I never mind.

336
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,157
Speaker 0: It's like almost 11.

337
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:44,478
Speaker 0: Damn it.

338
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:47,306
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I got a Ubuntu this box.

339
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,112
Speaker 1: Anyway, yep, but all right.

340
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,880
Speaker 1: my thing of the day, this is old news.

341
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:57,611
Speaker 1: I assume a lot of people have seen it, but I'll bet a lot of you haven't and again It's been all over dig.

342
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:02,196
Speaker 1: So someone must have rediscovered it so I might as well use it and there have been things like this before.

343
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:07,054
Speaker 1: but a Lot of people aren't so hip to this internet thing.

344
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:15,529
Speaker 1: They really don't get it especially older people with non technical jobs and Children who don't pay attention to the world outside of.

345
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:18,780
Speaker 1: I don't know the newspaper TV news and what people tell them at work.

346
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:20,700
Speaker 0: Thank You captain obvious.

347
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:25,867
Speaker 1: So a lot of these people things that they do not understand they tend to fear.

348
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:30,554
Speaker 1: and one of these things is Leet speak there now to us.

349
00:25:31,016 --> 00:25:36,996
Speaker 1: leet speak Back in the day was something that wasn't like a thing people did.

350
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:45,801
Speaker 1: just occasionally You'd make a joke or you'd spell something funnily or a lot of people spoke like type that way to be funny like check it Out.

351
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,289
Speaker 1: I'm elite hacks or ha ha ha a few.

352
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:51,620
Speaker 2: where's people would type that way so you couldn't find their sites on Google.

353
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:54,491
Speaker 1: Yep, and some people took it seriously.

354
00:25:54,531 --> 00:26:04,459
Speaker 1: There were you know hacker types mostly Thirteen-year-old stupid kids who thought it was actually cool and actually the way things were done to type that way.

355
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:14,420
Speaker 2: Yeah, real hackers of you know The Kevin Mitnick level weren't talking in leet no or even proto leet where you just capitalized every other letter.

356
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:21,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that was awesome Super awesome double bonus awesome fair it was leet.

357
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:27,816
Speaker 1: so when mega Tokyo Started getting popular, and they made a lot of leet jokes early on you know back when the comic was funny.

358
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:43,077
Speaker 1: Oh burn And All of us own zor and people in our generation of geek Started saying all the stuff from mega Tokyo all this kind of retro leet speak as a joke.

359
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:44,220
Speaker 1: It was totally ironic.

360
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,045
Speaker 1: We'd say things like ha ha ha fear.

361
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,247
Speaker 1: Oh, haha.

362
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:56,540
Speaker 1: That was funny fear and Fast forward about two years, and it was no longer ironic, and we were saying it in all seriousness.

363
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:06,687
Speaker 1: Damn you Come to today where I say the word teh not as a joke but to emphasize something as opposed to the yeah Teh awesome.

364
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:08,440
Speaker 1: Teh leet speak.

365
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:19,339
Speaker 1: So people who don't understand all of what I just said will see their child typing these strange Glyphs on the computer things that they don't understand and it frightens them.

366
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:20,787
Speaker 1: So then they turn on the new.

367
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,260
Speaker 2: they're obviously trying to conceal something for their parents.

368
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:34,609
Speaker 0: And if they're trying to conceal something from their parents obviously they're up to no good and their child bird Predators typing in secret codes that are going to molest your children and take them away Gypsies in the night one.

369
00:27:34,689 --> 00:27:36,539
Speaker 1: no kid is not up to no good.

370
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,475
Speaker 1: Just a matter of what degree.

371
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:40,930
Speaker 1: if no good They're up to it could be.

372
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,740
Speaker 1: I was always up to no good And I remember very distinctly my father and my mother too.

373
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,260
Speaker 1: But they what they basically told me as a kid was that I had unlimited freedom.

374
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:56,445
Speaker 1: I could do whatever I wanted because they trusted me not be stupid and my mom said don't do anything bad And we'll continue to trust you.

375
00:27:56,846 --> 00:28:00,139
Speaker 1: my dad said don't get caught do anything bad, and we'll continue to trust you.

376
00:28:01,873 --> 00:28:06,180
Speaker 1: So These people will turn on the news and they'll see my thing of the day.

377
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:23,460
Speaker 1: This is a bunch of complete tools and a bunch of people who think they're a lot smarter than they are Explaining the sinister world of leet speak these secret codes that kids use to hide Information from the police and their parents in order to be molested by horrible people.

378
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:32,598
Speaker 2: Yes, because when I was a kid and as soon as I was smart enough to type leet You know in a useful fashion all I wanted to do was get molested by 35 year old guys.

379
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,095
Speaker 1: No, not only is this this is utterly hilarious.

380
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:40,313
Speaker 1: It's kind of like that Don't smoke weed commercial and Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.

381
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,019
Speaker 1: Hey, is this your dad's gun?

382
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:45,102
Speaker 1: It's just.

383
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:47,211
Speaker 1: it's totally crazy.

384
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:49,018
Speaker 2: it's more like that bicycle safety video.

385
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,047
Speaker 1: It's just and every like.

386
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:54,569
Speaker 1: you know how?

387
00:28:54,649 --> 00:29:00,793
Speaker 1: in whatever Fox News or anyone does one of these special reports They always kind of have these something could be harming your children.

388
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:01,415
Speaker 2: Yep.

389
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:02,540
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

390
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:06,369
Speaker 1: Simpsons did a joke like they're like and stay.

391
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:09,760
Speaker 1: come back after the break to find out which popular soda may kill you.

392
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:15,633
Speaker 1: But every graphic they use is subtle fear-mongering.

393
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:20,131
Speaker 1: every time they show a kid typing something in leet It's always something like be quiet.

394
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:24,459
Speaker 1: My parents are here or Or are you home alone?

395
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:32,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah This would be really funny except that I think a lot of people take it really seriously.

396
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,080
Speaker 2: I think they do.

397
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,539
Speaker 1: I mean Internet's serious business.

398
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:48,880
Speaker 0: Okay, can we go on to the main bit all right last time we talked about hard drives and partitions and all that kind of Cool stuff and people seem to be really interested.

399
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,334
Speaker 0: They weren't interested when we had our previous episodes about how computers work, but all of a sudden.

400
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:55,080
Speaker 0: Oh now they care.

401
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,813
Speaker 0: So we're gonna continue and please the fans.

402
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:09,706
Speaker 1: and we're good to talk today about File systems because remember you partition the drive you set up all these different You know virtual drives on it or whatever and now you want to put your stuff on it But you still can't do that.

403
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:14,320
Speaker 1: yet in Windows you got to right-click on the drive and say format And it asks you some questions.

404
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,111
Speaker 1: You probably don't know what those questions means.

405
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:22,600
Speaker 1: you just hit ok a bunch of times And then your computer has a little percentage bar that takes about four hours to complete and then you go about your business.

406
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:41,466
Speaker 0: Yep, and Linux, you know you make a bunch of partitions But some of them had to be swap partitions and some of them have to be Data partitions and some of them you also want Windows to be able to read data from and you have to choose something different and some Of the partitions might have Windows on it, and you want Linux to be able to read it And it gets all really confusing.

407
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:46,240
Speaker 0: well that is because all these partitions are formatted with different file systems.

408
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:50,394
Speaker 1: You see you don't just put data raw on the hard drive.

409
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:51,859
Speaker 0: Well you do basically.

410
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,185
Speaker 1: well No, you don't direct.

411
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:53,889
Speaker 1: I mean think about it.

412
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,778
Speaker 1: You did you want to put data on the hard drive?

413
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:02,820
Speaker 1: alright So you write all the bits and bytes from an mp3 on the hard drive in the first whatever space is on the hard drive.

414
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:14,980
Speaker 1: Now say you then put more mp3s just right next to it in a row, so you've got this hard drive that's ones and zeros and There's all the ones and zeros from mp3 number one and then all the ones zeros from mp3 number two.

415
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:19,200
Speaker 1: How do you know when you want to read that mp3 back?

416
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,460
Speaker 1: Where one file begins and one file ends because there's no markings on the hard drive.

417
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,687
Speaker 1: It's just ones and zeros.

418
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just got a row ones and zeros.

419
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,522
Speaker 0: How do you know?

420
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:32,980
Speaker 0: which set of ones and zeros is this file and had which set is the other file?

421
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,671
Speaker 0: I mean you might try to open up an mp3 with the text editor And you know it'll look like text.

422
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:46,980
Speaker 0: or you know you might load You know the wrong zeros and ones off the drive into the wrong program, then who knows what the hell's gonna happen?

423
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,682
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

424
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:50,612
Speaker 1: now one thing you could do is say you put you.

425
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:57,995
Speaker 1: have you come up with a standard where in the beginning of Any set of data that I put on the hard drive any discrete single file.

426
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:05,508
Speaker 1: Let's say I'll say to myself I'll make the first number of bytes a Number that will tell me how big this file is.

427
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,559
Speaker 1: so I know from whenever I read how many bytes I have to read to get the whole file.

428
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:19,457
Speaker 1: And then I'll also know that the next byte after that Starts the next file, and it'll start with my little thing that tells me how big that file is.

429
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,426
Speaker 1: now That's kind of the beginning of a file system it.

430
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:41,280
Speaker 1: now you have an ordered method of knowing how to find files on the drive But at the same token, it's really slow because you have to basically read the drive Straight through file by file until you get to the file you want And you really have no way of jumping around because you have no way of knowing where an individual file begins and ends.

431
00:32:42,167 --> 00:33:00,220
Speaker 1: I could continue this whole thing But at the end of it you get a file system where instead of your program having to do this or you having to do It manually or your anything having to do it you use a standard method that someone else has come up with To put data on the hard drive know where that data is and optimize access to it.

432
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:09,786
Speaker 0: Yes, there are very simple methods such as fat or fat 32 which you may have heard of which is like the lowest common denominator In modern PC file systems.

433
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:17,492
Speaker 1: there are much more fancy methods like riser FS or XFS JFS or NTFS or HPFS or HFS.

434
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:20,140
Speaker 0: HFS plus is what max use yeah?

435
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:32,916
Speaker 0: Yes, there are many many fancy file systems out there, and they all have different purposes and different complicated ways of storing data on drives and arranging data on drives and remembering where files are.

436
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,901
Speaker 0: and you know Optimizing.

437
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:42,559
Speaker 0: you know ways to get files faster or read and write files to the drive more quickly and more slowly And it gets crazy.

438
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:44,207
Speaker 0: But you don't have to know any of that.

439
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:48,924
Speaker 0: unless you want to make a file system or write a file system Handler or anything like that

440
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:53,840
Speaker 1: or if you want to make a computer that really really needs extremely optimized performance

441
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:59,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a super enterprise thing, but all then all you really have to know is which file system to choose.

442
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:02,428
Speaker 0: You don't really have to know how they work You just have to know about them.

443
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:11,396
Speaker 1: and also luckily for all of you needing to know about file systems the level of importance in this started out kind of low because there weren't that many to choose from.

444
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:19,860
Speaker 1: and then it kind of got high because there were a lot of options and nothing like old Linux's didn't really do a lot for you automatically and Windows.

445
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:24,255
Speaker 1: you had to choose between NTFS and fat 32 and there were pros and cons of using either.

446
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:32,539
Speaker 1: and now luckily It's going back down again because with things like Ubuntu and modern windows You don't need to care again because a lot of it just happens.

447
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:43,387
Speaker 0: Yeah It used to be that file systems as they tried to as technology improved the file systems didn't couldn't handle large hard drives They couldn't handle large files.

448
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:46,820
Speaker 0: They couldn't handle a lot of things that tech new technology brought.

449
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:53,996
Speaker 0: So because the limitations of file systems you had to know a lot about them so that you could manage them in a way to Get your stuff to work.

450
00:34:54,541 --> 00:35:00,579
Speaker 0: But then the file system is eventually caught up with the technology and now you just pick one and you won't know.

451
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,628
Speaker 0: you can't Even tell which one you're using unless you're doing something crazy.

452
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:07,280
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if you're using the xt2, you'll drive some performance issues.

453
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,210
Speaker 0: Xt2 works pretty good for your boot partition.

454
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:11,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

455
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:12,115
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:15,496
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe xt3 with old journaling.

457
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:21,160
Speaker 0: Yes Let's talk about a few of the important things you do have to know about choosing a file system.

458
00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:25,659
Speaker 0: The first important thing you have to know is journaled versus not journal.

459
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:35,800
Speaker 1: now I'll say very simply that the general trend is that almost all modern robust file systems are in some way Journalized as the only non-journalized file systems.

460
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,955
Speaker 0: You're probably going to run into our xt2 and fat 32 any other file system.

461
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:42,940
Speaker 1: fat 16 fat 12.

462
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,412
Speaker 0: You're not using those you're not gonna run into those and that's using an old DOS computer.

463
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:48,480
Speaker 0: You might have fat six the one on CD-ROMs.

464
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:53,880
Speaker 0: Okay, yes a CD-ROM has a non journaled file system on it.

465
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,917
Speaker 0: Yes for some floppy disk has a non journaled file system.

466
00:35:56,937 --> 00:36:00,860
Speaker 1: now You might wonder what this means and it's kind of complicated.

467
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:03,714
Speaker 1: I'll try to do this as non technically as possible.

468
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:05,000
Speaker 0: I could do it pretty non technically.

469
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,824
Speaker 1: I think I can too.

470
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:06,668
Speaker 1: We'll kind of play it.

471
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:12,209
Speaker 0: All right, and a journaled file system is Anytime you want to do something to the hard drive.

472
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:15,160
Speaker 0: Let's say write a file delete a file read.

473
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:22,048
Speaker 0: Well, not read a file anytime you want to make a change to the data on the drive you have this journal and what you do.

474
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:33,660
Speaker 0: the journals another space on the drive in the file system and Before the file system does something to the drive it writes down what it's about to do and this sort of rotates.

475
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:42,057
Speaker 0: You know in this big log, you know journal and you know something that you did a long time ago We'll drop off the end of the journal and something you just did we'll get on top of the journal.

476
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:51,143
Speaker 0: now What happens here is let's say the computer's in the middle of doing something to the hard drive, you know, it's writing a file down and What do you know?

477
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:54,072
Speaker 0: the power gets cut as it's writing the file.

478
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,780
Speaker 0: this used to fuck you a long time ago.

479
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,185
Speaker 0: This would fuck you royally.

480
00:36:58,767 --> 00:36:59,811
Speaker 1: Well, it depends because it.

481
00:37:00,293 --> 00:37:11,029
Speaker 1: there were times when a hard drive I mean nowadays for performance reasons a lot of systems would do things where they would say something is written to the drive But it wouldn't really be.

482
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:25,259
Speaker 1: it'd be queued up to be written later But it would be held in RAM Not written to the drive in order to let the computer get on with its business while it waited for the slow hard drive to Be ready which meant you stood to lose a lot of data if suddenly a computer got turned

483
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:37,798
Speaker 0: off Yeah, there's also race conditions involved or if one thing happens before another thing which is possible Then you know You might lose data or data might not actually be written to the drive the way you think it is.

484
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:40,829
Speaker 0: and then power goes out or something else happens.

485
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:46,572
Speaker 0: and then you know you the computer comes back up and The data isn't like you thought it was and something got lost.

486
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:47,275
Speaker 0: and that's not good

487
00:37:47,576 --> 00:38:04,260
Speaker 1: now in pure Write transaction file systems and kernels where it's set so that you can't write to the drive indirectly You can't write to the drive and not have it actually write to the drive where the computer will sit there and not let you Do anything until every bit of data needs to be written to the drive.

488
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:11,928
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be that big of an issue because whatever file you were modifying at the time would be fucked but the file system would be consistent still mm-hmm.

489
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,403
Speaker 1: as you started off loading this and letting the computer think things were written to the Drive when they really weren't.

490
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:27,119
Speaker 1: and let's say the computer updated its table in the file system saying how big a file was and Just before it actually writes to the file the next step the power goes out.

491
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:31,160
Speaker 1: Now when the computer turns back on the file system is in an inconsistent state.

492
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:40,274
Speaker 1: One part of the file system says one thing but that part of the file system It's talking about is not that way and that doesn't just screw the file you're working with.

493
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:41,980
Speaker 1: that can screw up everything.

494
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:43,773
Speaker 0: Yep, now back in the day.

495
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:45,081
Speaker 0: There were a few ways You know.

496
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:50,857
Speaker 0: if this happened it could either screw you or you could run a program like scan disk or would.

497
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,000
Speaker 0: there are all those?

498
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:04,561
Speaker 0: Programs these back in the day this check disk this all these kinds of little programs that would check your file system to make sure It wasn't screwed up and it would attempt to fix it if something like this happened Nowadays.

499
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:09,215
Speaker 0: because every time a file system is about to make a change it writes something to the journal.

500
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:15,877
Speaker 0: if it's a journaled file system This is much easier because it just looks at the journal and says that's everything.

501
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,022
Speaker 0: I said it was gonna Do.

502
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:19,392
Speaker 0: let's look and see what it actually looks like now.

503
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:20,979
Speaker 0: Let's look at that journal again.

504
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:24,560
Speaker 0: Aha, and everything's fixed really quickly with no problems.

505
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:33,120
Speaker 1: Yep, it'll step through what was supposed to be done and kind of redo it all so that everything is consistent And you might still lose data depending on what happened.

506
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Speaker 1: But you're very very very very unlikely and in some cases It's almost impossible in fact to have an inconsistent state or an actually broken file system.

507
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, so while you might lose a file or two at the most something like that your file system will not be incorrect.

508
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:56,640
Speaker 0: It will accurately and correctly know which files are where on your hard drive will not report report to you false information.

509
00:39:57,142 --> 00:40:06,820
Speaker 1: But again, you don't really need to worry about that because you're probably going to install something like Ubuntu Where it just works, it'll just use a file system.

510
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:11,220
Speaker 1: It's gonna be journalized because you're not really gonna see a non-journalized file system anymore.

511
00:40:11,421 --> 00:40:14,220
Speaker 1: Yep, and you'll never even care what file system is on the drive.

512
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:14,924
Speaker 0: No, you won't.

513
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:22,193
Speaker 1: you won't even know if even if someone asks you now in Windows It used to be you used to really have a choice between fat 32 and NTFS.

514
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:25,337
Speaker 1: before that there were other things But don't worry about that.

515
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:32,445
Speaker 0: Yeah the only file systems windows actually really supports are fat 32 at NTFS and this is a Problem for a few reasons.

516
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:39,650
Speaker 0: is that if you put Linux on some partitions in a hard drive in your computer Windows can't really access those partitions now.

517
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,759
Speaker 1: There are ways to make windows be able to read ext3.

518
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,126
Speaker 0: It's not easy.

519
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:46,560
Speaker 1: It's a pain in the ass and you can break things.

520
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:53,336
Speaker 0: Yeah Also You notice you know how you'll get an iPod and it'll say formatted for Windows formatted for Mac.

521
00:40:53,777 --> 00:41:00,160
Speaker 0: if it's formatted for Mac That's because it has an HFS+ file system on the storage space in the iPod.

522
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:06,080
Speaker 0: If it's formatted for Windows It has a fat 32 file system on the storage space in the iPod.

523
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:09,251
Speaker 0: Now a Mac can read a 532 file system.

524
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:15,639
Speaker 0: a Linux computer could read just about any file system You've got but Windows can only read a couple of them.

525
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:21,880
Speaker 0: So that's the reason that iPods, you know have the two different formatings when you plug it into a Windows computer or a Mac.

526
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:29,419
Speaker 1: Now one thing that people particularly in Windows used to have to worry about is the block size And they might have called it something different.

527
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:41,020
Speaker 1: But when you to put it very simply when you address files on a hard drive when you're looking for them when you're writing them The block size is how big of a chunk you write at a time.

528
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,497
Speaker 1: So let's say you make the block size one megabyte.

529
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:45,120
Speaker 1: That's huge.

530
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,540
Speaker 1: But let's just say if you write a file that's 1.5 megabytes worth of data.

531
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,608
Speaker 1: It takes up two blocks worth.

532
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:55,760
Speaker 1: so it ends up taking up two megabytes worth of space on your disk.

533
00:41:56,402 --> 00:42:04,020
Speaker 1: This was a problem back when hard drives were small and you really have to fiddle with your block size To do the trade-off between space wasted and performance.

534
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:11,611
Speaker 0: Yes because if you had bigger block sizes you had better performance and that you could actually Address all those different blocks.

535
00:42:11,672 --> 00:42:12,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were too many blocks.

536
00:42:13,682 --> 00:42:17,193
Speaker 0: Old computers weren't powerful enough to handle so many different blocks.

537
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:17,594
Speaker 0: They couldn't.

538
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:19,500
Speaker 0: they didn't have enough room to address them all.

539
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:25,120
Speaker 0: you know if you have Like two bits that's enough to address four blocks.

540
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,400
Speaker 0: So if you've got five blocks, well, you don't have enough address space.

541
00:42:30,902 --> 00:42:32,006
Speaker 1: Yep, and you just have.

542
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:35,740
Speaker 1: there are a lot of debates over how big they could be and how small they should be and blah blah.

543
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:38,450
Speaker 1: Now doesn't matter all automatic.

544
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,534
Speaker 1: don't even worry about it.

545
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:41,180
Speaker 0: Don't even worry about that shit anymore.

546
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:47,420
Speaker 1: So what do you have to worry about with file systems aside from picking one if you even have that option with whatever you're installing?

547
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:55,852
Speaker 0: So there are two things you really have to worry about and both of them involve Windows and NTFS because on Linux and Mac file systems just work nicely.

548
00:42:55,913 --> 00:43:04,556
Speaker 0: The first thing is something you may have heard of defragmenting or Fragmentation and defragmentation would be the cure for fragmentation.

549
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:14,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically You know in old file systems like, you know NTFS and fat 32 and all that if you had files would be written to the disk all over the place.

550
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:23,360
Speaker 1: Parts of a file might be in all different places depending on how it was written to the drive because it might have been written In a hurry, it might have been faster to write different parts in different places.

551
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:26,884
Speaker 0: That's just the way those file systems work Is that they don't?

552
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:27,225
Speaker 0: you know?

553
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:34,239
Speaker 0: always make sure that all the files and the driver arranged in a nice way They write them to the drive according to a different method.

554
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:43,600
Speaker 1: Yep So whenever you had to read them back a lot of times if they were in weird places It would slow down as the hard drive had to scan all over the place to get all the bits and put them together.

555
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:50,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's say you had a video file That was a hundred megabytes, you know, and it looks at your hard drive and it finds 50 megabytes of free space.

556
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,923
Speaker 0: So it puts the first half of the video file there and then it goes to the end of the drive where there's more empty Space.

557
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:56,819
Speaker 0: it puts the second 50 megabytes over there.

558
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,225
Speaker 0: Well now you've got.

559
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:02,020
Speaker 0: you know trying to read that video file isn't gonna be so fast.

560
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:05,100
Speaker 0: I mean, you're not really gonna notice the slowdown big-time.

561
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:14,567
Speaker 0: But after a while use the computer a lot you move files around a lot you delete files you install programs your move programs You download videos you delete videos.

562
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:18,240
Speaker 0: You're gonna have a lot of files and a lot of pieces all over your hard drive.

563
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:19,825
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a big mess.

564
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:26,486
Speaker 0: So you have to run defrag in Windows and that will fix Mostly this problem.

565
00:44:26,586 --> 00:44:28,775
Speaker 0: and now first all the files can take you.

566
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:32,480
Speaker 1: real quick tip Defragging in Windows is slow as hell.

567
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:42,960
Speaker 1: And if you want to do it real quickly The fastest way to do it is to take all the files you want to defrag men Copy them to another drive and then copy them back because they'll be rewritten sequentially.

568
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,088
Speaker 2: Yeah, that that's a good method.

569
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:51,940
Speaker 2: if you have like a bunch of video files and like a media drive Just copy them all to some other media drive and copy them back.

570
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,148
Speaker 2: But that's not always possible.

571
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:54,840
Speaker 2: if you know, you got a really big drive.

572
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:58,420
Speaker 0: So the only other way to do it is to run the defrag program.

573
00:44:58,621 --> 00:44:59,966
Speaker 0: I recommend running it overnight.

574
00:45:00,568 --> 00:45:03,660
Speaker 0: If you have really big hard drives, it might take a really long time.

575
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,808
Speaker 1: Yeah And don't run it while you're using the computer.

576
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:10,288
Speaker 1: that just makes it slow and it won't be able to do anything to files you're Working with and it'll make a mess.

577
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it generally it's not effective.

578
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,256
Speaker 1: You also can't really run it if you don't have enough free space on the drive.

579
00:45:17,316 --> 00:45:20,888
Speaker 1: if your drive is almost full Don't even bother trying to defrag men it.

580
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:22,293
Speaker 1: it might not even work.

581
00:45:22,574 --> 00:45:24,100
Speaker 1: if it does it's gonna take days.

582
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:31,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean imagine if you're trying to defragment like this 200 megabyte file and you've got 50 megabytes of free space.

583
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:37,720
Speaker 0: Well, it's gotta try to get that file into one piece and it's only got this small amount of free space to work with.

584
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,815
Speaker 0: It's like one of those sliding puzzles where yeah, you know, you're trying to slide everything.

585
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,240
Speaker 0: You only have one empty space.

586
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,280
Speaker 0: So you're trying to it really sucks.

587
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:49,280
Speaker 1: I can't just put it all in RAM or anything because then if anything happens you lose that data.

588
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:51,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's really a big man.

589
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,043
Speaker 0: I shouldn't.

590
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:55,400
Speaker 1: people ask us a lot is well, how do I defrag in Linux?

591
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,980
Speaker 1: And the answer is very simply you don't need to anymore modern Linux file systems.

592
00:46:01,162 --> 00:46:02,780
Speaker 1: Take care of that shit for you.

593
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:10,213
Speaker 0: but Linux file systems have been taking care of that shit for you since ext2 and early 90s, so Don't worry about it.

594
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:10,939
Speaker 1: It's fine.

595
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:21,158
Speaker 0: If you're not using NTFS or fat 32 you do not need to defragment the file system because it is intelligently designed If I may say so.

596
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,120
Speaker 0: There is a great article.

597
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:27,334
Speaker 0: I'll see if I could find the link to it and maybe we'll put it in the post about.

598
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:36,147
Speaker 0: that shows you pictures and diagrams of why Linux file systems don't need to be defragmented but Windows ones do and That should explain it for you.

599
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:38,220
Speaker 0: But all you need to know is that in Linux?

600
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,699
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as defragmenting because because the file systems don't suck.

601
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:48,120
Speaker 0: Now the other thing you need to know about file systems besides fragmentation is how do you read and write?

602
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:51,480
Speaker 0: NTFS and Windows file systems from Linux and Mac.

603
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,699
Speaker 1: Well, the first part reading is very easy.

604
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:57,750
Speaker 1: Linux can pretty much just read NTFS.

605
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,195
Speaker 1: fine with no trouble at all.

606
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:00,499
Speaker 0: modern Linux is can.

607
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:05,136
Speaker 1: yeah If you boot in Ubuntu CD Ubuntu Ubuntu, it'll just read NTFS.

608
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:06,160
Speaker 0: Well, you have to mount it.

609
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:10,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you mount a drive you have a hard drive and you mount it, it'll just read the NTFS.

610
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:10,942
Speaker 1: fine No trouble.

611
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:11,584
Speaker 0: No trouble.

612
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:15,455
Speaker 0: But if you want to write data to it, that's another story.

613
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:16,096
Speaker 0: now.

614
00:47:16,658 --> 00:47:22,514
Speaker 0: right now I would recommend if you're using Linux do not write data to an NTFS file system.

615
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:23,216
Speaker 0: Don't even try.

616
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:24,520
Speaker 0: it's not worth the effort.

617
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:43,367
Speaker 0: I mean if you really need to put data on to an NTFS file system that you have in a Linux file system Just like drop in a live CD copy that data to some other thing like a DVD or another hard drive with a fat 30 Or thumb drive or something something like that Reboot to Windows and then write it.

618
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:47,180
Speaker 0: It'll save you a lot of hassle and it'll be nice and easy.

619
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:58,040
Speaker 0: I mean it won't be as slick and stylish and as time and time-saving as it could be But it'll work guaranteed if you're adventurous.

620
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,506
Speaker 0: there are a few things you could try.

621
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:11,060
Speaker 0: first thing you could try is you could enable NTFS writing in the kernel and That's complicated and it actually has limitation in that you can't change the sizes of any files or delete any files.

622
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:20,140
Speaker 0: So if you have a text file with a hundred words in it You can pretty much you can edit it but in the end you can't add any letters or remove any letters.

623
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,176
Speaker 0: So it's not useful at all.

624
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:28,672
Speaker 0: and the only other thing you can do is There's a way that people are talking about now.

625
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:30,520
Speaker 0: You can find some how-tos on forums.

626
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:38,080
Speaker 0: I haven't tried it or you can actually take the NTFS driver from Windows and run it in Linux to read and write to file systems.

627
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:40,330
Speaker 0: You can try it if you really want to.

628
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,640
Speaker 0: maybe is like on a test file system or something.

629
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,388
Speaker 1: I've seen people say it works just fine.

630
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:45,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure it does.

631
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:46,780
Speaker 0: I just haven't tried.

632
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,867
Speaker 0: No, the only reason I don't.

633
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:49,939
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's not easy to set up.

634
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,666
Speaker 0: No, it's not as easy as doing nothing.

635
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:57,245
Speaker 1: The only reason I don't try is simply that for all that dual booting trouble Just buy more hard drives.

636
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:58,208
Speaker 1: They're so cheap.

637
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,780
Speaker 1: I just bought a 320 gigabyte hard drive for less than a hundred bucks.

638
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it depends what you want to transfer.

639
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:10,700
Speaker 0: for, you know, there are different reasons to be transferring data between NTFS and Linux.

640
00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:20,512
Speaker 0: I mean, let's say you got you're using wine to read some programs off of an NTFS drive But then you want wine to be able to say write some data to that drive.

641
00:49:20,552 --> 00:49:21,175
Speaker 0: You never know.

642
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:25,394
Speaker 1: there people have their reasons Yeah, and I found ways around almost all of those reasons.

643
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:25,776
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:26,138
Speaker 0: Yep.

645
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,095
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, we're gonna stop now because we went on long and there's not much we can say.

646
00:49:31,155 --> 00:49:32,580
Speaker 1: without going into technical details.

647
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:43,039
Speaker 0: We kind of rambled a bit Yep But all you have to know is that you put zeros and ones in the hard drive and you need some way to figure out Which zeros and ones are what and that is what a file system is.

648
00:49:49,562 --> 00:49:52,148
