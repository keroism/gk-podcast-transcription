00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:33,120
Speaker 0: I would like to go to that in Essen.

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,283
Speaker 0: I really want to go to and I'm trying to swing some business to have an excuse to be over in Germany right around Essen time.

00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:38,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

98
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:39,869
Speaker 2: Yeah, you should definitely.

99
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:40,632
Speaker 1: let's go in a tangent.

100
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:41,656
Speaker 1: What's it like over there?

101
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:42,560
Speaker 2: It's crazy.

102
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:50,316
Speaker 2: I really want to go to the Finnish game con for a bunch of reasons But the Danish con fast of all it's.

103
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,462
Speaker 2: um It's weird.

104
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:54,048
Speaker 2: It's not typical role-playing.

105
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:54,871
Speaker 2: It's not what you think about.

106
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:04,845
Speaker 2: It's not a bunch of people sitting around a table with dice and screens and character sheets, it's a lot of Essentially like improv acting.

107
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:08,435
Speaker 2: like you get a scenario which is the scenarios are weird.

108
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:14,329
Speaker 2: Most of them are realistic Historical or kind of literary.

109
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,919
Speaker 2: the one I was in was like a Lars Van Trier movie we had.

110
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:26,652
Speaker 2: it was called Easter a tragedy and I played the Sun in a four-person household.

111
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:32,230
Speaker 2: my sister and I had come back from From Copenhagen to visit our family out in the country.

112
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:38,546
Speaker 2: And so we visited mom and dad and in the game We actually went to this The the con.

113
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:42,340
Speaker 2: that part of the con was held in classrooms and we actually knocked on the door of the classroom.

114
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:46,452
Speaker 2: Our mom and dad let us in and we sat down and actually ate Thanksgiving.

115
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,835
Speaker 2: I'm not Thanksgiving.

116
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,644
Speaker 2: I'm sorry Easter dinner Is Easter.

117
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,111
Speaker 2: a tragedy was actual food actual food.

118
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:53,653
Speaker 1: like.

119
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:55,840
Speaker 1: you didn't have to go get lunch because the food was like the game.

120
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:56,287
Speaker 1: It was.

121
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:56,816
Speaker 2: it was.

122
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:04,748
Speaker 2: It was brown bread butter Pickled herring Historically accurate food.

123
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,619
Speaker 2: It was all like traditional Easter.

124
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:12,670
Speaker 2: Easter the GM that the guy who wrote The GM was okay.

125
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,294
Speaker 2: So here's the weird thing about Danish tradition.

126
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 2: The GM is essentially the director.

127
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:20,735
Speaker 2: So if he doesn't like how things are going he will step in and he will whisper in your ear.

128
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:24,530
Speaker 2: be more intense Or you feel very sad about this.

129
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:33,697
Speaker 0: Well, Luke does that to me when I play in his game But but I mean the Danish guys will.

130
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:38,294
Speaker 2: actually We were in things where they made us redo scenes that they were.

131
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 2: they didn't feel we captured the moment.

132
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,532
Speaker 1: They're recording these on video.

133
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:42,378
Speaker 2: No, no, it was.

134
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:48,980
Speaker 0: That almost might cheapen it in that it like without having a record you only have the rosy memory.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,185
Speaker 0: So there's no.

136
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,916
Speaker 1: so this isn't like there's no rules book you can buy for this right?

137
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:53,960
Speaker 2: No, no, there's scenarios.

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,102
Speaker 2: Oh the scenario tradition.

139
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,624
Speaker 2: It's weird because they'll they'll.

140
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,708
Speaker 2: they'll have people write scenarios and the writer.

141
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:13,690
Speaker 2: the role of the writer is Huge like, you know RPGs whatever you come with the scenario who cares see it's all about the players play play play In Denmark, it's all about the writer of the scenario and the person who runs it and it's basically the writers vision in the directors.

142
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,738
Speaker 1: Implement implementation of that.

143
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,730
Speaker 2: you're essentially it's like George Lucas directing his human actors.

144
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,149
Speaker 2: You know where he just kind of treats them as the same as the CG actors.

145
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,573
Speaker 2: It's weird.

146
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,421
Speaker 2: we had we had one player in one of the games.

147
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:32,329
Speaker 2: I was in actually run out of the room crying and she With the game Because it got really intense.

148
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:34,757
Speaker 0: So I got a question.

149
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:37,670
Speaker 0: Do you think we could sell something like that?

150
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,525
Speaker 0: Not not monetary not commercialized but like get people in the US to play a game.

151
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,250
Speaker 2: totally no problem.

152
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:52,663
Speaker 2: So I could I could rewrite Easter a tragedy for an American audience Which it basically just involves changing maybe the holiday and definitely changing the food.

153
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:58,053
Speaker 2: Well the language I had an English version of it But pretty much straight-up run it.

154
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,498
Speaker 2: you are a conservative family out in the Midwest.

155
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,140
Speaker 2: you're home from the big city.

156
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,730
Speaker 1: No from the military from the military, whatever, you know, whatever.

157
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:13,730
Speaker 2: And the interesting thing about so the interesting thing about Easter which I which I didn't explain is every.

158
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:20,090
Speaker 2: The game is divided into phases and essentially the game ends when the good mood at the table is broken.

159
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:24,370
Speaker 2: So when a fight breaks out or when somebody cries or when when something bad happens.

160
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,326
Speaker 2: And the thing is when once you eat dinner There's a very there's a set ritual about what you eat when and what you talk about and stuff like that.

161
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:46,226
Speaker 2: and it's weird talking about Basically making small talk with people you don't know in real life who are portraying people that you don't know because you haven't Met them before in the game, but you're supposed to intimately know them because you're a family.

162
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:49,229
Speaker 2: really weird But by the second phase it was easy.

163
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:50,877
Speaker 2: so the first phase we.

164
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:56,790
Speaker 2: you go through dinner and blah blah blah blah, and then the mother says Well, you should probably be heading back.

165
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:08,984
Speaker 2: It's getting dark and that's the cue for everybody to basically say their goodbyes Shake hands hug whatever and then leave and then the GM hands out little secrets about what happened in that year And then you go back and you play the next year Easter dinner.

166
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:18,466
Speaker 2: Oh You do this over and over and over again Which meant I ate a lot of pickled herring during that game Which thankfully I like that stuff, but it was.

167
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:19,972
Speaker 2: you know It was.

168
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:20,615
Speaker 2: it was rough.

169
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:22,081
Speaker 0: that's some good stuff.

170
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:22,442
Speaker 0: we got it.

171
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:26,536
Speaker 0: we got to get that gaming Concept into us gamers.

172
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:29,508
Speaker 1: is everyone at the con playing Easter or were there just a bunch of different?

173
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:29,910
Speaker 1: No there was.

174
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:35,325
Speaker 2: I think there were four Sessions of Easter going on concurrently, and that's yeah, so there were only.

175
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,730
Speaker 1: there weren't that many scenarios.

176
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,517
Speaker 1: They were doing the same one a lot.

177
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:38,999
Speaker 2: Well.

178
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,318
Speaker 2: Here's the thing it's really weird is what they'll do is They'll hand off.

179
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,708
Speaker 2: They'll write the scenario They'll hand it off to a bunch of GM's and a bunch of GM's at the con will run the same scenario for a bunch of groups.

180
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:55,854
Speaker 2: So it's not like this one game system being run by many people, but it's different Scenarios or adventures or whatever.

181
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:58,321
Speaker 2: it's like no you're running Easter a tragedy.

182
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,287
Speaker 2: you're running sex drugs and rock and roll.

183
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:10,348
Speaker 2: you're running 15 men and there's a meeting where you actually get the materials and sometimes That's the first time you've seen this stuff, so you read it the GM's read it, and then they run it.

184
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:15,430
Speaker 1: That could even work with just our kind of tabletop RPGs where you know you go to a con.

185
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:21,060
Speaker 1: Someone writes up like three Burning wheel mascot scenarios for the con and just hands them out.

186
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,250
Speaker 1: get it yeah ten GM's over and you're like here's the scenarios.

187
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:27,630
Speaker 1: Everyone go and run them you know and then it's like players.

188
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:33,345
Speaker 0: He has all the tables there's an interesting kind of mechanism Designed to that of the whole con and that now all these players are playing.

189
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:37,199
Speaker 0: these games have a shared But disparate experience which forces them to talk to each other.

190
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,462
Speaker 0: Oh, how did your yeah go?

191
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:39,786
Speaker 0: well everybody died.

192
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,470
Speaker 2: well Easter so Easter Theoretically will last until the mood is broken.

193
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:53,090
Speaker 2: we we went I think three or four years before my sister and father got into an argument about Drinking because she did not want to tell him she was pregnant because he would have flipped out.

194
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,881
Speaker 2: And so he was like oh, why are you being rude?

195
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:56,404
Speaker 2: Why you know?

196
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,510
Speaker 2: I'm just trying to be hospitable.

197
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,539
Speaker 2: Why are you being you know so rude and so bratty?

198
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,187
Speaker 2: and they got into a screaming match in.

199
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:01,770
Speaker 2: the game ended?

200
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,356
Speaker 1: Oh, but he wanted her to drink.

201
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:06,593
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she was like no, but she doesn't want to say I'm pregnant I can't drink.

202
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,457
Speaker 2: She just has to say no.

203
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:08,341
Speaker 2: I'm not feeling like it.

204
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:10,210
Speaker 2: He's like oh your brother's gonna drive.

205
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,838
Speaker 1: That's good on the writer.

206
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:12,625
Speaker 1: They're coming up with that.

207
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:13,190
Speaker 1: It's really good.

208
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:17,570
Speaker 2: So what happens in the fifth year is the father drops dead at the table of a heart attack?

209
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:25,100
Speaker 2: So no matter what happens the game ends after like five years, but man that fifth year It's like a Darren Aronofsky film everybody's secrets that you get.

210
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,704
Speaker 2: it's just like oh my god.

211
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:27,467
Speaker 2: I want to kill myself.

212
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:31,455
Speaker 0: This is so depressing I Feel like it solves a big problem.

213
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:36,582
Speaker 0: I mean even at burning apocalypse con like the so-called hardcore like we are hardcore role players Let's go.

214
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,429
Speaker 2: No idea what hardcore isn't.

215
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:41,374
Speaker 0: This is.

216
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:44,063
Speaker 0: this is like a guy coming up to me like I'm a metal head.

217
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,810
Speaker 0: I listen to Metallica every day.

218
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:51,769
Speaker 2: There's one game very controversial game, I don't even know if I should talk about it.

219
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,330
Speaker 2: It's called And I'm spacing on the title something about the fat man.

220
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,981
Speaker 1: Is it insulting to fat people?

221
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,169
Speaker 1: yes, okay?

222
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,721
Speaker 2: Extremely, so here's how you play.

223
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,110
Speaker 2: everybody plays.

224
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:16,346
Speaker 2: So What happens is the fastest people got the fattest male player in the game session plays the fat man.

225
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,093
Speaker 0: that might prove contentious in the US.

226
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,789
Speaker 2: well get out the scales.

227
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:28,450
Speaker 2: You know the scales in the in the measuring tape so that so that the largest male player Plays the fat man everybody else plays the friends of the fat man.

228
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:37,095
Speaker 2: And I'm kind of air quoting friends because what the friends of the fat man do during the game is insult the fat man Constantly berate and belittle him.

229
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:46,527
Speaker 2: the fat man has a pocketful of candy and whenever he eats a piece of candy They have to stop berating and belittling him and actually complement him and act really super nice to him like they're.

230
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,054
Speaker 2: like the fat man Is the best friend.

231
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,044
Speaker 0: wow that's already a little messed up.

232
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,509
Speaker 2: No it gets better It's so much better.

233
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,075
Speaker 2: So the fat man has.

234
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:06,975
Speaker 2: the fat man character is given a safe word which if the game gets too Stressful and intense he can say that the the safe word in the game will end Except privately.

235
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,489
Speaker 2: the friends of the fat man are told to ignore the safe word.

236
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:20,987
Speaker 2: So the game ends when the fat man gets so upset that he actually leaves and the game is supposed to and I love this Is what's great about Denmark because everything has this deep meaning to it, and they're very serious and very earnest.

237
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:21,750
Speaker 2: They're really cool.

238
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,430
Speaker 2: But it's kind of comical because the the scenario guys like yes, this is and I can't really do a Danish accent.

239
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,229
Speaker 2: Yes this because of the game is to make you feel guilty about about being so mean to the fat man.

240
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,198
Speaker 2: That's what the game is about about your shame.

241
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,363
Speaker 2: I'm like.

242
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:39,829
Speaker 2: it just seems like abuse to me.

243
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,580
Speaker 1: You're teaching the people the players a lesson.

244
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,845
Speaker 1: what about the fat man?

245
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,070
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's crying in the dark.

246
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,207
Speaker 1: I know I feel like you could be sacrificed for the better of the group.

247
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:51,910
Speaker 0: some experiences.

248
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,029
Speaker 0: We've talked about a geek nights back in the day with casting people out of the crew.

249
00:13:55,471 --> 00:14:00,470
Speaker 0: Did you know it's very difficult when there's a guy that nobody's actually friends with but you know he's really in a tentacle porn.

250
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,888
Speaker 0: you Try to make him leave you alone.

251
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,334
Speaker 0: Finally someone breaks it to him.

252
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,729
Speaker 0: You could make it the game that you give to people as the final resort.

253
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:14,469
Speaker 2: Yes Hey You want to play a game in case of bad game or break glass and inside is a cop games as tools to.

254
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,850
Speaker 0: actually You're working on your YouTube game.

255
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,183
Speaker 0: My game is a card game that you play to decide what the fuck to do.

256
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,470
Speaker 0: right now who gets control of the internet TV?

257
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:29,968
Speaker 0: Yes, but mine's a card game that also does meta stuff like ordering pizza.

258
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,255
Speaker 1: That's actually a clever idea right cuz?

259
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:37,050
Speaker 1: like people always talk about you know jokingly how like diplomacy is a friend killer or something right?

260
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,876
Speaker 1: Well, it's like what.

261
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,508
Speaker 1: if you want to get rid of some friends?

262
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,076
Speaker 1: You could make a game that helps you.

263
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:49,163
Speaker 1: it's like you know or maybe even stand because most most games They help you make friends even if they're not designed specifically to do so.

264
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:52,479
Speaker 1: you could probably make a game That is like the friend making game.

265
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:56,054
Speaker 1: right you know you need to make the Girlfriend getting game.

266
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,263
Speaker 2: well, that's breaking the ass Emily care boss.

267
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,367
Speaker 1: Did that did she?

268
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:00,090
Speaker 1: what's it called?

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,636
Speaker 2: I'm not breaking the ice is it?

270
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:07,282
Speaker 0: so there's actually a lot of like mini LARP's with simple rules that are designed for that.

271
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:07,443
Speaker 0: like.

272
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:08,187

Speaker 2: that is it.

282
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:35,896
Speaker 2: yeah apparently people actually have gotten together after playing that game, huh All right, nobody's gone together after playing action castle though There's too many people although.

289
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,286
Speaker 2: I probably won't do it at Gen Con.

290

Speaker 0: maybe packs But packs you get.

291

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,089
Speaker 2: I mean that apparently they they have done large shot of our IT.

296
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:09,855
Speaker 0: It was exactly like.

297
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,959
Speaker 1: you don't want those people.

298
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,962
Speaker 0: I mean they were.

299
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,187
Speaker 0: they weren't role-playing vampires.

300
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,190
Speaker 0: They were vampires.

301
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,340
Speaker 1: That's different people are.

302
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,566
Speaker 1: they didn't even count as people.

303
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,389
Speaker 1: I mean come on whatever.

304
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:24,710
Speaker 0: But but to back up a little bit, you know the super the so-called hardcore like role players in America.

305
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:32,989
Speaker 0: Even like the best role players I know will be in character for maybe 30 seconds of their great monologue and then it always trails off into.

306
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,702
Speaker 0: yeah I try to convince the guy to not kill my son.

307
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,626
Speaker 0: It's role-playing.

308
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,784
Speaker 0: It's not acting Yeah, but I feel like the acting is happening.

309
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:44,368
Speaker 2: helps if you're a good actor it helps Yeah, but I like the games that trick people into acting.

310
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,510
Speaker 0: Yeah Like, you know burning wheels duel of wits kind of tricks people into like having a reasonable argument.

311
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,274
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

312
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:52,470
Speaker 1: I actually don't know how well I would do as cool as like the Danish thing sounds.

313
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,540
Speaker 1: It's like I'm not that good at acting.

314
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,529
Speaker 1: So like when it's so free like makes you stretch Yeah, but it's like, you know, that's why I like when there's dice and stuff.

315
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:04,970
Speaker 1: Not just because I like rolling dice, which I do but they do not like dice over there, right?

316
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,785
Speaker 1: But because it helps me suck suck less when I have some numbers to go by right?

317
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,329
Speaker 1: It's like I'm a computer guy.

318
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,409
Speaker 1: I know how to make numbers go up.

319
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,050
Speaker 1: So it's like I'll just do the thing I need to make those numbers go up which happens to also be good acting at the same.

320
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,902
Speaker 0: Yes, you did this like you go between the two like I found it's got you personally.

321
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:23,215
Speaker 0: you role-play better when you're not playing A character but you're playing an accent.

322
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,445
Speaker 0: if you pick an accent you play a good character.

323
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:29,740
Speaker 0: That's Yeah, that's we need to make that an RPG.

324
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:33,635
Speaker 1: all the accent RPG Ridiculous accent.

325
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:35,810
Speaker 0: So how did you come up with the idea for action cows?

326
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,436
Speaker 0: Like when was the?

327
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:37,690
Speaker 0: what was the moment where you're sitting there?

328
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,181
Speaker 0: They're like I should run this for a bunch of people.

329
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:41,446
Speaker 2: I was at a party.

330
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:42,210
Speaker 2: I've told the story.

331
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,361
Speaker 2: God, I just told the story in the genocides.

332
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,326
Speaker 2: go listen to her podcast.

333
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:45,768
Speaker 1: Okay?

334
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,936
Speaker 2: There's a little plug for Jen.

335
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:50,462
Speaker 2: yeah, listen to it's.

336
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:51,668
Speaker 2: I've told the story a bunch of times.

337
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,221
Speaker 2: basically I was at.

338
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,009
Speaker 2: I was at a party.

339
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:55,815
Speaker 2: We were kind of hanging out.

340
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,618
Speaker 2: I had this idea.

341
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,810
Speaker 2: I'm a big text adventure fan from my days of yore.

342
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:11,172
Speaker 2: I actually worked for info comm as a 12 year old Playtesting one of their games and I got to tour their office and meet all the peeps there and I actually have My.

343
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:20,800
Speaker 2: I was going through my box of my box of sad memories and in my box of sad memories is a t-shirt I made with Floyd the robot from Planet Fall and on the back.

344
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,675
Speaker 2: It says I love info comm and it would barely fit a Cabbage patch kid.

345
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:25,319
Speaker 2: It's hilarious.

346
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:25,742
Speaker 2: I'm like man.

347
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:26,849
Speaker 2: I was a tiny little kid.

348
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,662
Speaker 2: It's crazy.

349
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,662
Speaker 2: But yeah, I loved info comm.

350
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:38,286
Speaker 2: I had a poster in my Poster in my bedroom for years that said what kind of computer were using for these info comm games?

351
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:38,889
Speaker 2: Oh Apple 2e.

352
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:42,104
Speaker 2: I owned a GS.

353
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:42,630
Speaker 2: I never played.

354
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:49,350
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played wizardry all the time on my GS wizardry and Dungeon Master and some crappy games.

355
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:53,345
Speaker 1: If the thief the Apple 2 GS is probably the best computer there ever was.

356
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,469
Speaker 2: that was pretty sweet.

357
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:59,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I have one because I know you know our experience with action castle was you we didn't.

358
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,972
Speaker 0: you were just this weird Guy.

359
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:04,850
Speaker 0: and Luke still am a weird guy you are but Luke Crane was this other weird guy.

360
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:08,541
Speaker 0: He's very weird and you know He was that weird guy who tricked us into playing a stupid game.

361
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,676
Speaker 2: and I tricked you and I'm playing my stupid game Cuz we were at PAX.

362
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:11,957
Speaker 0: we did.

363
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:14,770
Speaker 0: you know that beyond Dungeons and Dragons like you guys should play.

364
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,954
Speaker 2: That's right.

365
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,243
Speaker 2: Cuz cuz we did the.

366
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:18,110
Speaker 2: we got together.

367
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:18,693
Speaker 2: We were.

368
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:22,030
Speaker 2: everybody was like kind of milling around looking for something to do after we were stupid.

369
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,907
Speaker 0: We were like so and if anyone wants to play this game, that's the guy who made it.

370
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,249
Speaker 0: follow us out We'll find a table.

371
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,434
Speaker 1: It was like Jared's gonna do the thing and I'm like what thing Cuz.

372
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:34,796
Speaker 0: we formed an angry mob of like 200 people who were like we want to play this We want to play burning meal.

373
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,422
Speaker 1: it's like already think but that was.

374
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,848
Speaker 1: I was oh wait, I think.

375
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,015
Speaker 1: yeah I think that was.

376
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,010
Speaker 0: that was our first temper of oh wait.

377
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,284
Speaker 1: So that's it's been like three four years.

378
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:45,670
Speaker 0: That was our first packs panel.

379
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,042
Speaker 0: That was one of the first like fan panels ever at a packs.

380
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:49,530
Speaker 0: That was it was fun.

381
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some like crappy video of that panel.

382
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:52,229
Speaker 0: we ran.

383
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,161
Speaker 0: I forgot how tiny those rooms used to be at packs for panels.

384
00:19:55,582 --> 00:19:57,690
Speaker 1: I think they said what did they use that room for now?

385
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,663
Speaker 1: I think that's now like the mag mag fest stage, right?

386
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott came over to me.

387
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:10,609
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah that the guy with the hair is gonna do some thing to get the crowd from killing us 30 Something people just kind of lined up going what is going on?

388
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,429
Speaker 0: Yep, and then by the end like it became this legend of packs I got recognized in Grand Central Station leaving a Depeche Mode show.

389
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:30,709
Speaker 2: These two kids who are at the anime con kinetic on They recognized me they were at that con and they recognized me in Grand Central and as I walked by I heard Hey, that's is that the action castle guy.

390
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:32,174
Speaker 2: And then I turned around.

391
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:38,255
Speaker 2: and then they do the torch hands and they go action castle and I was just like, oh my god Isn't that great?

392
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:48,684
Speaker 0: Like cuz we're you know, we're all like D level internet celebrities like D List like C list is perhaps even F list Like the bottom of Wil Wheaton's fandom, like we're.

393
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:50,570
Speaker 0: so like we're a level under if not more.

394
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:55,650
Speaker 0: Isn't it really fun when someone recognizes you in like New York like you feel like a big man for a few minutes?

395
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do but I'm like that.

396
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,449
Speaker 0: Okay, really not at all.

397
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:00,814
Speaker 2: It's just kind of.

398
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,423
Speaker 2: it's what it makes me think of cuz.

399
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:04,266
Speaker 2: I think I've made some.

400
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:13,416
Speaker 2: I haven't made a lot of Well known games, but you know, I've made some kind of cool ones some I'm really proud of and and it's like like John Gielgud going.

401
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:19,463
Speaker 2: I you know, I was in other movies - Besides that Star Wars crap, you know on my tombstone.

402
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:26,273
Speaker 2: It's gonna be like action castle guy Say I'm not dead yet Let's talk about.

403
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:29,350
Speaker 0: if all the games you've made that you can talk about what's your what's your favorite one?

404
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,697
Speaker 0: Like what's the one that you're the most proud of?

405
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,050
Speaker 0: not maybe the most popular successful the one that you're proud?

406
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:34,368
Speaker 2: It's definitely not the most popular.

407
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,711
Speaker 2: Successful.

408
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:36,434
Speaker 2: a free market.

409
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:37,337
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

410
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:38,722
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really like free mark.

411
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:45,989
Speaker 0: I really like free market - The only problem I have with it is that most people only ever experience it as a one-off at a con.

412
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I feel like advancing the characters is 80% of what I love about that game.

413
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,037
Speaker 2: It's it's awesome.

414
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,950
Speaker 2: The character advancement system is awesome.

415
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:53,593
Speaker 0: What.

416
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,824
Speaker 0: so what do we do to get people to have that experience?

417
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:56,910
Speaker 0: because no one gets that at cons.

418
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,840
Speaker 0: I think that's the only reason free market isn't like.

419
00:21:58,981 --> 00:21:59,604
Speaker 0: maybe you could do.

420
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:07,747
Speaker 0: maybe you could just do like instead of playing for the cam Make a cam of free market like an official place where you can log your characters.

421
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:10,637
Speaker 1: No I'm saying is we should do?

422
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,690
Speaker 1: is instead of playing for four hours, right?

423
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,091
Speaker 1: We should do.

424
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:26,309
Speaker 1: is you make the characters in one hour and then end the session every hour so that you get to Experience points on the yeah, I think if I ever do free market demos I'll split the session into two parts so people can see how the you know.

425
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:36,310
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm thinking about doing that because the reason I want to do that is because something I learned Running free market at burning apocalypse con is that when the players actually know how it works, right?

426
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,919
Speaker 1: Cuz I play the game I played in.

427
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,850
Speaker 1: we actually knew how to how to work it, right?

428
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,861
Speaker 1: And we basically said it's one session burn everything, right?

429
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:50,250
Speaker 1: All right, we just set all our shit on fire and dominated And the first thing we did in the game was make level 3 tech for everybody.

430
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,210
Speaker 1: So we're like, all right, everyone set it on fire for the rest of the yeah.

431
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,367
Speaker 2: I think that that was what if that was a bullshit rule, by the way, right?

432
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:56,955
Speaker 1: We should have only had one.

433
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,770
Speaker 2: you should have one two at the most tied right or three level ones.

434
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,781
Speaker 1: but the point is is that we You know, we could have just done the challenge four times.

435
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:06,947
Speaker 1: It would have been the same thing, right?

436
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,130
Speaker 1: But we you know when you're not gonna go into the next session, you don't care about destroying your stuff, right?

437
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:15,257
Speaker 1: So you can easily.

438
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,370
Speaker 1: you can easily win if you just get rid of all your items.

439
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,816
Speaker 2: Okay, well the answer to that is just if I was the I haven't done this yet Cuz it'd be a real dick thing to do.

440
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:27,592
Speaker 2: but just have the the NPC super super user User characters.

441
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:28,856
Speaker 2: what the hell are they called?

442
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:29,197
Speaker 2: I don't know.

443
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:34,494
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the you know, the super user control characters have them burn out stuff Like.

444
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:36,646
Speaker 2: I have tons of tech that's not even written down.

445
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,430
Speaker 2: I'm just gonna burn it.

446
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,239
Speaker 1: That's one thing that I always have trouble with.

447
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,270
Speaker 1: is like when you're the super user, right?

448
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,104
Speaker 1: It's like how you know, what can I act?

449
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:43,810
Speaker 1: do I have gene line?

450
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,816
Speaker 1: I'm the super.

451
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:45,502
Speaker 2: you do have gene line.

452
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:46,229
Speaker 1: sometimes you do it.

453
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,648
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's a specific like if you're doing a certain kind of challenge, right you have two and two.

454
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,878
Speaker 2: Yeah Here's what you have access to against yourself.

455
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,866
Speaker 1: You're used to use the other guy's character sheet, right?

456
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,734
Speaker 1: Oh, it's thin slicing It's against yourself.

457
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:56,919
Speaker 1: I'll just use whatever's on your sheet.

458
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:57,481
Speaker 1: You got gene line.

459
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,733
Speaker 1: I have it too, but sometimes it's like What do I have?

460
00:24:01,235 --> 00:24:01,878
Speaker 2: Well, there's there's.

461
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:04,730
Speaker 2: I mean you do the little card drawing thing to it to generate the NPC.

462
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,200
Speaker 2: So sometimes you have tech and you know, you can burn it.

463
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got it.

464
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:09,450
Speaker 1: I always keep forgetting to do that.

465
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:10,736
Speaker 1: Do the card drawing.

466
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,129
Speaker 2: the whole printing thing though when you were printing was a bowling ball.

467
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,356
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I overheard your game cheating.

468
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:20,954
Speaker 2: So the idea with printing is we kind of looked at rapid prototyping right now and just said Future.

469
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:24,250
Speaker 2: so it's not like I print a billion marbles.

470
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,877
Speaker 2: It's you print one perfect marble because it's.

471
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:29,003
Speaker 2: it's not made to produce mass-produced stuff.

472
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:34,141
Speaker 2: It's made to rapidly produce one thing cultivation is what you'd want if you want a million marbles.

473
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:40,240
Speaker 2: because you just set up like a little face a factory and But you couldn't print a factory you'd have to print.

474
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,526
Speaker 2: you could print a factory that would help you print.

475
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:44,170
Speaker 2: cultivate marbles.

476
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:45,599
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you.

477
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,768
Speaker 2: you print one factory.

478
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,010
Speaker 2: People are always like oh, why don't you just make another space station?

479
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,135
Speaker 2: I'm like you got.

480
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,448
Speaker 2: you can't print the space where the matter come from.

481
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,236
Speaker 1: The matter is not a problem.

482
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,270
Speaker 2: It's just the the space like where you're gonna store these giant girders.

483
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,110
Speaker 2: The problem is you'd have to do it like piece by piece by piece.

484
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,214
Speaker 2: It would take away.

485
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:06,258
Speaker 2: you could totally do it you could.

486
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:09,230
Speaker 2: it's like the the with the maker bot reproducing itself.

487
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,664
Speaker 2: It doesn't reproduce a maker about it reproduces all the parts.

488
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:12,790
Speaker 1: And what about see the problem?

489
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,710
Speaker 1: I've always thought of is, you know, it's like well, why don't you go out into space?

490
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,360
Speaker 1: I'm like if you got into space you can't get back in.

491
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, you left.

492
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:18,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

493
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,188
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay, we're gonna build a space station outside.

494
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:25,027
Speaker 1: Okay Well, the first guy brings a girder out and he won't get back in to print the second.

495
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:25,690
Speaker 2: You'd have drones.

496
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,057
Speaker 0: Well, that can be a goal.

497
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,429
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, you could totally do that in the game.

498
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:35,152
Speaker 0: Like it's just it sets up the end game really well Cuz the first.

499
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,370
Speaker 1: every time I would just laugh because the players wouldn't think of the drones like you did and someone would go outside of the space station.

500
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:40,711
Speaker 1: I'd be like.

501
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:45,210
Speaker 0: the first thing the characters always ask like when I'm talking about the game is could I fucking blow up the space?

502
00:25:48,032 --> 00:26:00,069
Speaker 2: When we were developing this game one of one of the the guys because we worked with Hidden City To develop free market originally and one of the guys who worked there was like well What's to prevent me from making like a rapist murder sociopath?

503
00:26:00,652 --> 00:26:03,545
Speaker 2: And I said do you want to play him rapist murder sociopath?

504
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:07,569
Speaker 2: and he's like, no I said well That's what's stopping you your own desire.

505
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,434
Speaker 2: But somebody could.

506
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:10,678
Speaker 2: I'm like, yeah somebody could.

507
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:11,461
Speaker 2: so far.

508
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,264
Speaker 2: Nobody has.

509
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:14,110
Speaker 2: we've had some weird characters.

510
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:16,766
Speaker 2: We've had some characters who were definitely not social.

511
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,084
Speaker 1: Was the closest you've come to?

512
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:19,769
Speaker 1: rape is?

513
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,679
Speaker 1: Closest the closest that you've seen.

514
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,365
Speaker 2: the closest game was the group.

515
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,590
Speaker 2: That was essentially.

516
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:28,897
Speaker 2: They were a cult.

517
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:30,181
Speaker 2: that were cannibals.

518
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,230
Speaker 2: they had a religious cult that that dealt with eating people.

519
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,334
Speaker 1: That's close to what we had.

520
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:38,250
Speaker 2: and they got a ballerina to cut off her feet and eat them.

521
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,884
Speaker 2: Whoa, that was a pretty dark game.

522
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:40,570
Speaker 1: That was okay.

523
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,217
Speaker 1: So we did see we did.

524
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:45,430
Speaker 0: is why is it always food like the majority of persons I've ever seen our food?

525
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,198
Speaker 2: Well, I the thing that people need I have in the.

526
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:51,287
Speaker 1: when we played at the first burning con they did.

527
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,170
Speaker 1: it was similar.

528
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,903
Speaker 1: It was cannibalism, but it was like gourmet cannibalism.

529
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,310
Speaker 1: eating yourself is so cool.

530
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,335
Speaker 1: It's transgressive.

531
00:26:57,395 --> 00:27:00,310
Speaker 2: It's one you can do it because there's no laws against it, too.

532
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,430
Speaker 2: It's it's you're physically capable of doing it because you can regrow parts or grow parts.

533
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:13,300
Speaker 1: We're doing a cooking show and they got this girl like cutter you know hands off into the pot so they can cook it and serve it up to everyone and then the Aggregates are repairing your hand.

534
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's Sure.

535
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:28,004
Speaker 2: I mean if you lived in the society, you could have a cannibal gourmet cookery show Sure, and some people are like hey since you can't do that now and there's no way to do that in other role-playing games Let's do that, which is perfectly understandable.

536
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:33,697
Speaker 2: when I play D&D I want to kill orcs and dragons because I rarely get a chance to do that in real life Because you know, I live in the city.

537
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:40,786
Speaker 0: I feel like this gives free markets and dragons in the city They're just underground Gators and the rats but it gives free market an opportunity to.

538
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:56,200
Speaker 0: I think just not disturb but like unnerve people when they like they play and I think every player can kind of get to this moment or They kind of realize that Social strictures maybe don't make sense or that maybe there is no absolute morality And I think it can put people into an interesting state of mind.

539
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,017
Speaker 2: I played one game where they met The the game it it got.

540
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:04,190
Speaker 2: it was kind of comical and there was bees in an opera house and it was really light-hearted.

541
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:13,130
Speaker 2: And then it got real dark real quick and it involved This woman's grandfather contacting her from the hole which is the the hub the center of the donut.

542
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,628
Speaker 2: I'm the center of the space station saying I'm here pick me up.

543
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,864
Speaker 2: And she's like Mike again and her grandfather was.

544
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:20,949
Speaker 2: her grandfather was dead.

545
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:25,428
Speaker 2: She had a memory of her father from her grandfather from Earth and she's like, where's my grandfather doing?

546
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:26,775
Speaker 2: He's dead He what.

547
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,033
Speaker 2: so she goes there and he's there waiting for And she's like.

548
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,848
Speaker 2: and he says you're my granddaughter, right and she's like, I'm really confused.

549
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:36,370
Speaker 2: what's going on?

550
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,890
Speaker 2: It turns out that some hacker on the space station was just messing with people.

551
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,429
Speaker 2: He's a switcher and he was a hacker and he made this blank.

552
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,017
Speaker 2: He got genetic material was able to reproduce.

553
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,208
Speaker 2: her grandfather gave him some false memories and let him loose.

554
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,056
Speaker 2: and she's like Why did you do that?

555
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,349
Speaker 2: He's like, I wanted to see what he'd do and I wanted to see what you do.

556
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,298
Speaker 2: And she's like, well, what is he gonna do now?

557
00:28:56,358 --> 00:28:58,367
Speaker 2: And he says that's not up to me.

558
00:28:58,407 --> 00:28:58,950
Speaker 2: He's a person.

559
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:09,327
Speaker 2: Yeah, he has his own free will and she's looking at him like Like those two things like you built this person to play a prank on me but I'm not responsible for him because he's his own person.

560
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:20,619
Speaker 2: like There's a moment in the game Which we don't specifically talk about but if you if you kind of put the pieces together It's clear that blanks are technology.

561
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,228
Speaker 2: up to a certain point blanks for those people don't know are essentially.

562
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:25,130
Speaker 2: they're like replicants.

563
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,114
Speaker 2: They're created humans.

564
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:26,657
Speaker 2: They're they're.

565
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:27,420
Speaker 2: they're printed.

566
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:35,660
Speaker 2: They're not actually born or or grown they're they're just output on a matter printer using cells instead of you know, carbon or metal or plastic.

567
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:43,910
Speaker 2: and at a certain point They go from being tech to being a user on the space station and we never say what?

568
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,409
Speaker 2: You need to do to actually create a blank?

569
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,202
Speaker 1: I always thought it was just a printing challenge.

570
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:51,327
Speaker 1: It's a blank.

571
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:51,870
Speaker 1: It's a really.

572
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,205
Speaker 2: There's three parts of it.

573
00:29:55,245 --> 00:30:00,204
Speaker 2: there's First you have to print the body right or cultivate the body.

574
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:01,188
Speaker 2: I guess gross gross.

575
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:06,494
Speaker 2: You need data.

576
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,942
Speaker 2: you need nine points of data, I think you can steal.

577
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,210
Speaker 1: you can donate memories, right the people, right?

578
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,428
Speaker 2: You have to fill it full of memories.

579
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:20,235
Speaker 2: You I have to fill it full and enough memory so I can upgrade those into skills so that it's not just the needs at Least an experience.

580
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:26,553
Speaker 2: It needs a couple experience at least and it needs interface.

581
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:34,828
Speaker 2: it needs a key to be recognized by the So that's that's a mob challenge and I was like, oh wait it needs one needs a mobbing challenge.

582
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:42,189
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we never we kind of gloss over because we just want to see what people do because we're not we're not sure.

583
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:52,900
Speaker 2: but yeah, there's that uncomfortable moment when somebody realizes one that My favorite one of my favorite reviews of the game was this game's broken because you should just play a blank because they have three Gene line, it's the only thing you can't improve.

584
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,027
Speaker 2: Why would you take anything else?

585
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:57,489
Speaker 2: I'm like Yeah, why would you play anything else than a blank?

586
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,939
Speaker 2: like eventually Wouldn't everybody on the space station be a blank?

587
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,458
Speaker 2: because eventually people would just I mean if they're the superior being That we created wouldn't they surpass us?

588
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,930
Speaker 0: Isn't that kind of welcome to the plot of the majority of anime that we like?

589
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,800
Speaker 1: Points you get your gene line, which you can't increase.

590
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:20,356
Speaker 1: experience which you can write Technology, which you can.

591
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:21,704
Speaker 1: and what's the other one?

592
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:22,670
Speaker 2: interface?

593
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,414
Speaker 2: Yeah Gene line.

594
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:29,466
Speaker 2: if you have a gene line three, you can't level up You can't you can't ever improve that.

595
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:29,910
Speaker 1: thought about it.

596
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,792
Speaker 2: And if your gene line - you can't ever increase the three you can you can decrease down to one but wouldn't like You know.

597
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:41,176
Speaker 1: third fourth gen, you know non Blanks have No quids came around.

598
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:46,810
Speaker 2: quids are quids which are the kids the children of the second gen the little crazy little geniuses.

599
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:49,239
Speaker 2: They're gene line - oh, they're human.

600
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,929
Speaker 1: They've been right, but it waited long enough like six sevens.

601
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:59,335
Speaker 2: maybe they would know because you because the ideas of blank is a perfect gene line because you've Designed it specific for.

602
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:05,073
Speaker 1: so they're not, you know, so there's not you know, really genetically engineering the the natural babies There is.

603
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:06,520
Speaker 2: that's why they have a - not a one.

604
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,429
Speaker 2: immigrants and first-gen have a one, right?

605
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,696
Speaker 2: Because they're alive.

606
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:12,850
Speaker 1: about your games like actually becoming serious.

607
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,055
Speaker 1: I have a really hard time.

608
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:19,445
Speaker 1: every game I play in or run always ends up silly in some way It's very silly world.

609
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:20,110
Speaker 2: It's a crazy.

610
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,650
Speaker 2: I mean if you lived in that world, it would be silly but it would also kind of be horrifying.

611
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:24,413
Speaker 2: It was also.

612
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:25,858
Speaker 2: it would also be kind of amazing.

613
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:27,203
Speaker 1: I can't seem to bring out the horror.

614
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:28,508
Speaker 1: Maybe it's my fault.

615
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:35,876
Speaker 2: probably I think it eventually will come when when people realize what's at stake You also haven't run a campaign.

616
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:37,122
Speaker 0: That's true a game over maybe.

617
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:40,870
Speaker 1: maybe if as you get more sessions the heart You know would be easier to get away from the silliness.

618
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,590
Speaker 0: Maybe when the players start to get to the point where they can do big things big things have big consequences.

619
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:48,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, big consequences lead to big Revelations.

620
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:49,899
Speaker 1: Oh, can I have another pad of character sheets?

621
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:50,923
Speaker 1: I'm I'm out.

622
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:54,715
Speaker 2: I am all out - I Wish I want extra cards.

623
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:57,065
Speaker 1: I'm like, you know, I'll trade you a deck of cards.

624
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,350
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any more characters.

625
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,350
Speaker 0: She said just a poor guy to kind of arguing with Luke.

626
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,478
Speaker 0: He was like, what if there's no more like?

627
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:03,561
Speaker 0: what if I lose my deck?

628
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,358
Speaker 0: and like you're both dead and there's no more free Market, like this is a pretty sight.

629
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:07,881
Speaker 1: and print him out.

630
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,290
Speaker 2: This is a pre scarcity game.

631
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,637
Speaker 2: Yeah about post scarcity economy.

632
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,708
Speaker 2: print one out or pre post scarcity.

633
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:16,932
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

634
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:21,669
Speaker 0: So let's talk about some of your other games since you want to you know, like, you know lacuna all this old stuff.

635
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:23,295
Speaker 0: Does anyone play lacuna?

636
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,460
Speaker 0: I mean we play a bunch of times.

637
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,270
Speaker 2: Yeah, I get lots of actual play reports and people.

638
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:27,893
Speaker 2: I still.

639
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:30,966
Speaker 2: I just sent one off in the mail yesterday to somebody in England.

640
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:43,557
Speaker 0: All right, nice Because as an aside someone gave me a copy of lacuna to get you to sign Three packs as ago and I said I've turned and said, okay How should I give it back to you?

641
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,990
Speaker 0: and the person already like ran away and I never found them.

642
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:48,584
Speaker 2: Remember that I signed it though, right?

643
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:49,210
Speaker 1: I've still got it.

644
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're that guy and you're listening.

645
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,208
Speaker 1: or if you're just someone who wants to get a free copy.

646
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,570
Speaker 1: lacuna If you if you are that side free sign copy.

647
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:58,910
Speaker 0: I remember enough about you to figure out if it's you or not.

648
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,749
Speaker 1: So I think it was a guy from a podcast maybe or something.

649
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:04,826
Speaker 2: It was either a guy or a girl.

650
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,693
Speaker 2: Narrows it down.

651
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:09,784
Speaker 0: At least it wasn't one of those genderless pygmies from the burning wheel game.

652
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:15,606
Speaker 1: I ran it to BAC hmm, so so let's talk about like just you know, what are you doing lately?

653
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:19,239
Speaker 1: playing any games or Listen any music's watching movies.

654
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,710
Speaker 1: What's cool for you right now for me?

655
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:32,616
Speaker 2: I'm spending a lot of time working on Z Ward and I have a lacuna - It's for real I've been working.

656
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:33,880
Speaker 1: return of the spider-man what's?

657
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:34,462
Speaker 2: no it's.

658
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:35,585
Speaker 2: it's actually a sort.

659
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:44,536
Speaker 2: it's a not a standalone game it's a source book and it's um, the idea is it's a collection of People places and things in blue city.

660
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,108
Speaker 2: So it's kind of like a little travelogue of blue city.

661
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:54,565
Speaker 2: But it's specifically because I didn't want to just do Because blue city the whole idea of it is you don't know what's in it.

662
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:54,947
Speaker 1: There's no set.

663
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:58,361
Speaker 2: So I was like, well, it's gonna be lame to do a source book.

664
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,310
Speaker 2: So I need to do something interesting with it.

665
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:07,290
Speaker 2: So what I did is I did 26 Originally 26 locations and they're all tramps the tram stops of the the train.

666
00:35:08,014 --> 00:35:20,529
Speaker 2: so each and they're all you know the ones that are from the game like boxer and diamond and abattoir and cafe and all the stuff from the original game book and then a whole bunch of new ones and Each is like a page of information about stuff going on in that area.

667
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:27,570
Speaker 2: and The idea is there's a corresponding map tile that will go with each tram stop and during the game.

668
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:31,605
Speaker 2: What you'll do is you start with cafe station because that's most of the time that's where you.

669
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:44,866
Speaker 2: you enter the world on when you dive into blue city and Then when you want to take the tram or go to another area the the GM will just grab another tile at random Put it face face up and say that's all I get to.

670
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:45,830
Speaker 0: you know, whatever station.

671
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,029
Speaker 0: Well, you don't know how long that's gonna take you.

672
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:54,361
Speaker 1: It's a little bit like those Like the newer D&D dungeon crawlies like the Raven loft.

673
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,470
Speaker 1: you flip the tile to make the next room.

674
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:02,082
Speaker 2: Yeah, as opposed to having a map that's or definitely inspired by stuff like that I played a lot of Raven loft and you know a shard along.

675
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,354
Speaker 1: I played the Raven loft once I was like It's not my style.

676
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not into those games.

677
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:08,949
Speaker 0: So I want to make a game that's like that.

678
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:10,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talked about this with Luke.

679
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:11,397
Speaker 0: So yes.

680
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:11,999
Speaker 2: Yes.

681
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,702
Speaker 2: I'm aware of this.

682
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:16,588
Speaker 2: Yeah, I Hear about this all the time.

683
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:28,347
Speaker 2: But yeah, so I don't want to you know kickstart that I also want to put in a lot of um There's a lot of Easter eggs about because you know You need to explain a little bit what the hell's go actually going on in blue city because I know.

684
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,618
Speaker 2: So I figured I might share a little bit of that.

685
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:33,505
Speaker 2: So there's little you can't.

686
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:45,821
Speaker 0: you can't figure out the mystery Just you know from the book, but it definitely gives you some interesting Like the idea of no one knowing but you because everyone I play a game with They always came up with what the mystery really is.

687
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:47,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always very similar.

688
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,923
Speaker 0: But then like every twist is different.

689
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:50,869
Speaker 2: Everybody thinks they're right.

690
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:57,290
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the one thing about one of the like mystery agents like the higher-up ones, right?

691
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:03,360
Speaker 1: Like there's the list of them in the book like the break agents and it's like you sort of see him in the background Of the double static right minor agent.

692
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,990
Speaker 1: my eyes, you know that Sun up with him.

693
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,361
Speaker 2: Nobody asked nobody actually no one person asked me.

694
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:09,466
Speaker 2: So where is agent minor?

695
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:10,290
Speaker 2: And I said, what do you mean?

696
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,370
Speaker 2: He's like, well, they said he's a wall, but where's his body?

697
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:23,339
Speaker 1: Right, and I'm like, you're the first person asked me sort of the obvious twist which is like the mystery agents used to be the Criminals and they got cleaned.

698
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:27,440
Speaker 1: now that the mystery that is never said in the book I know it's not said in the but every day master does that.

699
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,163
Speaker 1: I know if you've read if you actually look read the book Slowly and carefully you had to be a moron not to at least come to that conclusion.

700
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:36,775
Speaker 1: whether it's true or not, you know You could come to that.

701
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,230
Speaker 0: conclude like the face Jared is making Scott while he's saying all this.

702
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:44,867
Speaker 1: But you know, but other than that, it's like there is still plenty of mystery like this.

703
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:45,490
Speaker 1: spider-man.

704
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:46,595
Speaker 1: What the fuck are they?

705
00:37:46,856 --> 00:37:50,050
Speaker 1: they they're the guys who come at you late in the game when your statics too high.

706
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,274
Speaker 1: What else what else are they?

707
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:51,716
Speaker 1: I don't know.

708
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,081
Speaker 1: They're spider-man.

709
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:54,145
Speaker 1: They're scary.

710
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:55,470
Speaker 1: They're on the cover of the book.

711
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,274
Speaker 1: They must be important.

712
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:57,359
Speaker 0: I just get more interested.

713
00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:58,323
Speaker 0: Like what is static like?

714
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,810
Speaker 0: they're trying to figure out what that means.

715
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,647
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

716
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,390
Speaker 0: Could be ghost in the Shelly.

717
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,350
Speaker 1: It's a number that tells you how close the spider-man again.

718
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,182
Speaker 2: Well static static was always in the game But it only had a stat and an actual purpose in the game.

719
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:17,185
Speaker 2: on the the second attempt and the first attempt It was just like okay be mean to the players and fuck with them and confuse them.

720
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:23,129
Speaker 2: and now it's like, okay Be nice to the players until this number starts to go up and then slowly.

721
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,605
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's the magic which I like.

722
00:38:25,645 --> 00:38:26,410
Speaker 1: that game works.

723
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,093
Speaker 1: So well is.

724
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:30,350
Speaker 1: not only do you have that but it's it controls the pacing, right?

725
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:38,943
Speaker 1: so if you well the heart rate and static both control pacing, so if you Even if the GM knows nothing about good pacing the game the numbers are just right.

726
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,950
Speaker 1: good pacing can't not happen unless you cheat.

727
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:41,678
Speaker 0: Well, look at.

728
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:43,236
Speaker 0: look at all the like RPGs We like.

729
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:44,310
Speaker 0: like burning wheel mouse guard.

730
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:55,749
Speaker 0: These games are all designed to control Who gets control of the scene and when and like in burning wheel people push for things like they want a challenging test to advance or they want a routine test and that pushes the story toward these ebbs and flows.

731
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,284
Speaker 0: and Mouse guard is the system of checks like earning checks.

732
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:00,830
Speaker 0: right fucking myself, right?

733
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,850
Speaker 2: Now is the point in the game where things get really complicated because I want two checks instead of one.

734
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,289
Speaker 2: So I'm gonna you know break the tie-in.

735
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:12,728
Speaker 0: I've never seen a mouse guard game where a player uses a check against them and the entire rest of the table doesn't go.

736
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:17,588
Speaker 2: no Yeah, well you don't need those two dice.

737
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,129
Speaker 2: They're probably gonna roll ones anyway.

738
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,708
Speaker 2: So so yeah lacuna part two.

739
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,743
Speaker 2: I'm not sure when that's gonna come out 2012.

740
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,310
Speaker 2: I guess I've been busy with Z Ward.

741
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:35,522
Speaker 2: I'm gonna kickstart it and one of the things I'm gonna do with the book It's gonna be a book a PDF and I want to do tiles.

742
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:37,510
Speaker 2: I want to do cool map tiles.

743
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,256
Speaker 1: I want your tiles.

744
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,090
Speaker 2: I want to do really nice one.

745
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:48,465
Speaker 2: So, you know as it I haven't worked at the details But the the deal is you know PDF downloads that you can print out yourself at the low levels and at the high levels.

746
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:57,767
Speaker 2: if I raise enough money I'll do really sweet, you know, I'd like to do like, you know Small world style cards chipboard with the linen cover stuff.

747
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:02,185
Speaker 2: nice Yeah, small world by the way, one of my favorite games small world's good.

748
00:40:02,205 --> 00:40:03,250
Speaker 1: Have you played the underground?

749
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:03,892
Speaker 2: I haven't.

750
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:04,577
Speaker 1: I want not either.

751
00:40:04,597 --> 00:40:06,430
Speaker 0: Have you played the original Vinci?

752
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,165
Speaker 0: No, because Vinci is kind of an abstracted version.

753
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:10,949
Speaker 0: That's really fun.

754
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,066
Speaker 0: But the fundamental difference is that there's no restrictions on what can combine with what.

755
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:17,090
Speaker 0: it's just two things.

756
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,542
Speaker 0: So you can have like crazy weird powers that don't sometimes cheat.

757
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:22,268
Speaker 2: well small world you don't.

758
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:22,950
Speaker 2: there's no restrictions.

759
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:28,803
Speaker 1: there is in small world for example, there's race and ability in Vinci, oh you can have like.

760
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:33,839
Speaker 0: it's just a bag of Regeneration or like, you know medicine and barbarian.

761
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:43,330
Speaker 2: Okay, so to be like in small world if you grab orcs in spirits There's no number of turns there's a number of victory points.

762
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:45,629
Speaker 0: Okay, anyone goes over that the game ends at the end of that turn.

763
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:47,590
Speaker 0: So you see this weird like posturing.

764
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:51,149
Speaker 1: You know in small world, it's like, you know, it's gonna end.

765
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:56,290
Speaker 1: So that means I know I should decline on this turn because you know I want to decline two turns before the end of the game.

766
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:08,040
Speaker 1: So I come back into the board the sec the turn before the last time unless you have whereas in Vinci I decline when I think we're three turns away from the end and somebody else Purposefully delays to bring in an extra turn.

767
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:10,310
Speaker 1: and now I have one low scoring turn in for them.

768
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,395
Speaker 1: It's a high scoring turn.

769
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:14,229
Speaker 2: So Vinci is the small world as like pandemic is to.

770
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,781
Speaker 1: They're made by the same guy and basically Vinci.

771
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:23,423
Speaker 1: not only does it have some problems with it But it had a lot of misprints and the production quality was low.

772
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:24,850
Speaker 1: He really wanted to redo it.

773
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,722
Speaker 1: He put the small world theme on it, which made it sell small world.

774
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:29,770
Speaker 2: I mean it's the game itself is beautiful.

775
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,020
Speaker 1: She's just colored in little googly tiles.

776
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I like the skeletons a lot.

777
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:38,895
Speaker 2: skeleton Hi, I just it's.

778
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,449
Speaker 0: I like how the the fish men have like basically a fish bone.

779
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,405
Speaker 2: Yeah The icons are great like everything about the game is like the troll troll layers.

780
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:47,430
Speaker 1: Those are some my favorite.

781
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:49,810
Speaker 2: Yeah, the pieces are all real.

782
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,858
Speaker 2: I like the fact that even the mountains even though I'm like when I first started playing them Like why are there mountain pieces at?

783
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:55,884
Speaker 2: the mountains are on the board?

784
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:59,942
Speaker 0: Yeah, and at first I thought oh It's because that way everything is tokenized but forests aren't.

785
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:05,204
Speaker 0: and that pissed me off for like an hour Mmm, like I was trying to figure out why and I couldn't and it really bothered me.

786
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:07,533
Speaker 2: Well, it's because the mountains are Tokens.

787
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:10,426
Speaker 2: they count as a you know, but forests count as defense.

788
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,493
Speaker 2: They don't Know.

789
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,426
Speaker 0: oh they did in Vinci see here.

790
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:14,970
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

791
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:16,633
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

792
00:42:16,673 --> 00:42:21,550
Speaker 0: We had no Vinci inside and out and this game is very close to it.

793
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,970
Speaker 0: It's like 99% but there are such tiny differences that we never know the answer at any specific question.

794
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:28,649
Speaker 2: Some of the forests have the like little magic gem for wizards.

795
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,390
Speaker 0: That's actually burning real gold and burning wheel revised.

796
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:40,070
Speaker 2: I'm having the same problem like oh plus one and then everyone the tables like no I I do that when we do like when we were play testing free market or when I'm play testing.

797
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:45,167
Speaker 2: You know actually if I'm doing like and parsley game from memory and it hasn't actually come out yet.

798
00:42:45,308 --> 00:42:49,447
Speaker 2: Sometimes I'm like Which which game which version of the game am I running right now?

799
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:55,414
Speaker 2: All right, so that's what's going on.

800
00:42:55,434 --> 00:42:56,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, nice.

801
00:42:57,184 --> 00:43:04,560
Speaker 1: So so wait, but you know, you see you're kick-starting, you know The Z Ward now and you're gonna kick start the lacuna - yep when it's ready like how you know.

802
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,960
Speaker 1: Do you think like the Kickstarter well will dry up like, you know, how often can you kick start?

803
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:10,465
Speaker 2: I don't want to.

804
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:10,909
Speaker 2: I don't want to.

805
00:43:11,494 --> 00:43:12,100
Speaker 2: I want to do one.

806
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,044
Speaker 2: I decided I'm gonna do.

807
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:14,571
Speaker 1: I would be worried about if I was kick start.

808
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:22,076
Speaker 2: Yeah, like I. well Kickstarter is awesome for for me right now for my my constraints that I'm dealing with.

809
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:31,352
Speaker 2: it's really good and it's also really cool because It's I mean, I've done pre-orders on parsley games before and it was like 30 people.

810
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:32,135
Speaker 2: Yay.

811
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,499
Speaker 2: I got 200 people.

812
00:43:35,306 --> 00:43:35,758
Speaker 2: It's weird.

813
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,166
Speaker 0: There's a culture around Kickstarter.

814
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:42,280
Speaker 2: there's a culture adds to the momentum exactly and it's also a nice affirmation.

815
00:43:42,401 --> 00:43:44,855
Speaker 2: I'm getting lots of emails from people saying yay.

816
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:45,680
Speaker 2: I love these games.

817
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,080
Speaker 2: I played this game at PAX or I played this game in you know, Kinetic Con or Gen Con.

818
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,618
Speaker 0: I'll say this, you know, we run the panels department at Kinetic Con workshops all that stuff.

819
00:43:55,161 --> 00:44:00,920
Speaker 0: You guys you and Luke other than us are the most asked about people who come to the con?

820
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:01,843

Speaker 0: Do I have to line up early for it?

830
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,019

00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:42,199
Speaker 0: It's a four-day con.

840
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:44,587
Speaker 2: I could rock it.

841
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:45,753
Speaker 0: It's music.

00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:47,280
Speaker 1: It's 24/7.

843
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,553
Speaker 2: You guys have been pimping this for a while.

844
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:51,376
Speaker 2: I'm interested.

845
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:52,098
Speaker 2: I totally.

846
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:52,540
Speaker 0: it's way fun.

847
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,360
Speaker 0: I can't speak for getting you on panels or anything slowly for that, but there's a gaming intellectuals.

848
00:44:57,441 --> 00:45:00,440
Speaker 0: We're part of the mag 9 like 9 gaming 9.

849
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,485
Speaker 1: maybe the mags.

850
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:02,689
Speaker 1: first of all, it's the 10th mag.

851
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,180
Speaker 0: Well one you and I together count as one person, right?

852
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,666
Speaker 1: So there's also.

853
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:07,772
Speaker 1: it's the 10th mag fest.

854
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,120
Speaker 1: So it would it be the mag 10 now?

855
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:09,785
Speaker 1: It was not.

856
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:11,060
Speaker 1: is it even 10 people anymore?

857
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,432
Speaker 0: I think it's like 11 people there's gonna be.

858
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:14,700
Speaker 0: we just got the list of it.

859
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,431
Speaker 0: We're on to where I don't know if I'm allowed to say anything whatever.

860
00:45:17,893 --> 00:45:19,339
Speaker 0: We're on to discussion.

861
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:19,480
Speaker 1: temp.

862
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,767
Speaker 1: We're tentatively on to.

863
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:21,330
Speaker 1: there you go.

864
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,657
Speaker 0: Well, we're definitely on to.

865
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:23,040
Speaker 0: I'm still.

866
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,780
Speaker 0: no I would totally do it if I could get on panels and I'm saying I don't know if I can swing.

867
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:32,078
Speaker 2: Could if you could I'm just saying Let's table this and take it offline.

868
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,397
Speaker 0: We can introduce you to the person who runs the stuff and he will probably want you to do stuff.

869
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:46,265
Speaker 0: and I'm sure Because it's a really open con like we were running like just burning wheel and mouse guard and like danger patrol games for people Just randomly the whole con.

870
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:49,260
Speaker 0: you could just walk into an open area start doing action castle.

871
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,560
Speaker 0: You'd have a crowd of like a hundred within I know and no one would care.

872
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,724
Speaker 1: It's not like packs of the enforcers to be like, excuse me Can you move?

873
00:45:55,865 --> 00:45:58,340
Speaker 2: or origins where they just don't let you do it, right?

874
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:04,179
Speaker 0: It people just be like whatever I mean, there's guys just like jamming on electric guitars like outside the hotel and no one cares.

875
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:05,683
Speaker 1: We'll see.

876
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:07,752
Speaker 1: maybe this hotel will be more stuffy than the last one.

877
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:08,576
Speaker 0: We'll see.

878
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:12,794
Speaker 0: also Better not fucking happen.

879
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:16,829
Speaker 1: Oh my god Is our friend coming back?

880
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:17,855
Speaker 1: John St.

881
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:18,097
Speaker 1: John.

882
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:20,667
Speaker 0: The John St.

883
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:21,329
Speaker 0: John will be there.

884
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,352
Speaker 1: This is a bigger hotel.

885
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,660
Speaker 1: So maybe he can break his hotel room party record.

886
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,063
Speaker 1: We'll see.

887
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:29,094
Speaker 0: All right, I think we can wrap this up.

888
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:34,934
Speaker 0: So one last question What is the last movie that you've seen all the way through any movie?

889
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:35,436
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

890
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:47,820
Speaker 0: Uh, that would have been Because I just jeopardy the movie because I just you know The the movie that M Night Shyamalan tried to make about Avatar that then he died that car accident.

891
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,442
Speaker 0: They didn't finish.

892
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:54,020
