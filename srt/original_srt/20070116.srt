1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,509
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday January 16th.

2
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,620
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and I'm rim and this is geek night.

3
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,613
Speaker 0: Tonight we tell you all about blockus.

4
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,271
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:26,899
Speaker 0: Some people around the world live in a place where video games are easy to come by.

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,540
Speaker 0: you know There's like an ebay right next door to their house.

7
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:33,613
Speaker 0: Or there are five different stores selling video games within spitting distance.

8
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:39,300
Speaker 0: some people live in parts of the country Where you're lucky if you can find a video game store at all.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:48,998
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember then here in Wildwood at the time that Advance Wars DS came out God, we had to drive how far to go to the only EB within range.

10
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:52,977
Speaker 1: Yep I remember we then bought pretty much every copy of the game that guy had.

11
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,789
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, it wasn't only the only EB within range.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,317
Speaker 0: It was the only video game selling store.

13
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:00,440
Speaker 0: It's kind of crazy.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,737
Speaker 1: Well, there was that target or whatever.

15
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:06,680
Speaker 1: Kmart Yeah, whatever it was, but they don't really have launch games on launch day.

16
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:07,422
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

17
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:12,139
Speaker 0: so, you know when I this week there are two very important video games coming out.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,095
Speaker 0: There is Wario where we is coming out in the well in the u.s.

19
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:19,759
Speaker 0: Some of these games are already out elsewhere Bastards Wario where we is coming out this week.

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:28,660
Speaker 0: You can consider that rims most anticipated game of 2007 and Scott's most anticipated game of 2007 Phoenix Wright to justice for all is coming out.

21
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:36,540
Speaker 1: It's a good time to be alive and it's a good time to have a we in a DS Yep, so, you know, it takes us how long to go down to the GameStop.

22
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:40,700
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a bunch of video game stores here, but they're not right next to our house.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,533
Speaker 0: You have to drive at least 10 15 minutes to get to one.

24
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:46,158
Speaker 1: Whoa, Lord at 10 minutes Whatever will I do?

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:46,881
Speaker 0: you know it.

26
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:51,443
Speaker 0: the other thing is you're not only just to drive 10 15 minutes to get to one but it's sort of a Pain in the ass.

27
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:57,900
Speaker 0: and you know doing the show and doing stuff on the weekends I'd have a lot of time to go down there just to do buy a video game.

28
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:58,784
Speaker 1: It's not just that.

29
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:04,799
Speaker 1: in general I more and more really dislike going to Normal stores to buy normal things.

30
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:13,471
Speaker 1: If only there are a way I could without leaving the comfort of my desk ask other people to get these things for me exchange For money and deliver them to my door.

31
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:17,692
Speaker 0: Oh Well, you know I used to when I worked in the city go to the GameStop.

32
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:20,081
Speaker 0: that was right near the office as one Would.

33
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:22,634
Speaker 0: yes, but now I kind of gave up on that.

34
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,800
Speaker 0: for the first time ever I bought some video games on Amazon.

35
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:36,560
Speaker 1: See this all started this whole saga of us not needing to go to game stores anymore Way back when I was buying stuff on Amazon and I thought well, I'm buying stuff.

36
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:40,002
Speaker 1: Anyway, I might as well buy as much stuff as I can to get the free shipping whatever.

37
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:41,308
Speaker 1: and I don't lark.

38
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:52,409
Speaker 1: I decided to type in the name of some DS games and They were selling them pretty cheap in many cases far less than I would have paid for him in a game store Especially games that weren't the newest games anymore.

39
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,199
Speaker 1: and even the newest games are usually like five bucks off.

40
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:59,940
Speaker 0: No, the newest games are you know, at least Wario and Phoenix Wright were like a few cents off.

41
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, but portrait of ruin was six bucks off.

42
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,511
Speaker 0: Yeah.

43
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,057
Speaker 0: Yeah depends on the game.

44
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:04,960
Speaker 0: It's kind of random Yeah.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,739
Speaker 0: But the best thing is if you pre-order and the price goes down between the time of your pre-order and the time they ship it To you then you get the lower price.

46
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:17,159
Speaker 1: But the thing is the price is never more than you would pay in a GameStop or an EB.

47
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:27,640
Speaker 1: Nope, so in this day and age I think we've come to the conclusion that at least for new games as opposed to used games There is no reason to get games from anywhere other than Amazon.

48
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:36,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean as long as you get the free shipping and as long as you don't have a desperate need to have the game Right now, I mean, I'm not gonna get these games.

49
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:37,437
Speaker 0: these games come out tomorrow.

50
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:45,626
Speaker 0: in the next day I'm not gonna get them, you know, I'll be lucky if I get them on Friday, you know I'll probably expect to get them on Monday Maybe even later than that.

51
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:49,060
Speaker 0: I think the expected delivery date that it says on Amazon is Wednesday.

52
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:58,266
Speaker 0: So, you know the next Wednesday not not two days from now or I guess tomorrow or whenever you're listening They're not gonna be here real soon.

53
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,209
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

54
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:04,889
Speaker 0: so, you know, I'm willing to suffer that because right now I've got more entertainment than I have time to consume.

55
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:07,520
Speaker 0: so getting a video game like Wario or Phoenix, right?

56
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,396
Speaker 0: Which doesn't sort of have a time need on it a week later.

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,620
Speaker 0: Not a big deal.

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,232
Speaker 0: I'm willing to suffer in order to not have to leave my house and waste my time.

59
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:19,178
Speaker 0: So we'll see how this works.

60
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:21,529
Speaker 0: and Yeah, it could be cool.

61
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,113
Speaker 0: It could suck.

62
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,098
Speaker 0: We'll let you know.

63
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:42,719
Speaker 1: So in actual gaming news This game is kind of a blind side to me for a number of reasons because you see every year for the last many years I've attended ubercon Last year, I decided to bring other people along with me and every year It seems like more and more people come because ubercon is probably one of the best gaming conventions anywhere near us.

64
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:46,820
Speaker 1: Well, the thing about ubercon is that they always had two a year.

65
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,259
Speaker 1: There was one in the fall just before winter and run in the spring just after winter.

66
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:55,240
Speaker 1: So you kind of begin the gaming season the gaming season being the time you can't go outside.

67
00:04:55,904 --> 00:05:01,400
Speaker 1: Yeah with the gaming con and then at the end of gaming season You have one final fling before you go back out into that horrible dread Sun.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,883
Speaker 0: I think it's also kind of necessary for gaming cons because when you're at a gaming con I'm like other cons.

69
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:11,538
Speaker 0: the activities the individual activities at gaming cons tend to take many many hours.

70
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,503
Speaker 1: Yes So

71
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:27,199
Speaker 0: at one individual gaming con Even though there are the same number of hours in say ubercon as there are in Otacon You don't get as you don't feel like you did as much because you only played in like one RPG and you played ten board games and that was it

72
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:27,682
Speaker 1: Yep,

73
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:31,200
Speaker 0: and you feel kind of like eh and you paid a lot of money for it.

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,571
Speaker 0: So having two gaming cons, you know is kind of a bonus.

75
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get to spend twice as much money.

76
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:40,120
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean really all of you out there who go to gaming cons.

77
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,973
Speaker 1: You know gaming cons are very different from anime cons.

78
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:43,817
Speaker 1: I like both equally.

79
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,388
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Just we should go.

80
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,640
Speaker 0: we should pick a new gaming gun.

81
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:47,824
Speaker 1: I think we should.

82
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:57,580
Speaker 1: well we're gonna have to because you see ubercon for various reasons has been forced to Cancel this year's spring ubercon due to I think scheduling concerns.

83
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,140
Speaker 1: It hasn't been made a hundred percent clear as to exactly why but I imagine they couldn't get the dates.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,291
Speaker 0: Yeah, well those guys were never the most super organized con.

85
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,660
Speaker 1: see that is the one thing about gaming cons as opposed to anime cons.

86
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:14,286
Speaker 1: If an anime con isn't run Absolutely wonderfully by the staff.

87
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:16,555
Speaker 1: It will fall apart in about seven minutes.

88
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:28,219
Speaker 1: Yep gamers While they I'm not gonna say gamers are better than anime fans or vice-versa But gamers tend to really want to play their games and gamers tend to self-organize.

89
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:37,679
Speaker 0: If you just have a gaming con and all you do is get a bunch of gamers in a big room with enough tables They'll play games on their own and you don't have to do so much.

90
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact RIT was a good example of that.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,554
Speaker 1: there was the anime club which had a large board of very dedicated directors who did Constant effort to make the club better and get people to come and make it an awesome time.

92
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,857
Speaker 1: and any time they made a mistake Club didn't work out at all.

93
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,886
Speaker 1: People just like what's going on and leave.

94
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,118
Speaker 1: the gaming club was run by a bunch of incompetence.

95
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:10,220
Speaker 1: to put it lightly there were times when I was never really sure if it was actually a club anymore, but it didn't matter because they provided a room and 100 to 200 people would show up every Tuesday and play games all night.

96
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it really has to do with the nature of the individual hobbies.

97
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,455
Speaker 0: I mean anime is so passive compared to gaming.

98
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,439
Speaker 0: people just sit there.

99
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:27,780
Speaker 0: So if they are coming to some sort of club Someone has to do something because if not everyone else will just sit there waiting for something to happen.

100
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,137
Speaker 0: Yep Or as with gaming people are coming to something to do something and they're in.

101
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:34,100
Speaker 0: they got it on their mind.

102
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,039
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play this game and whether anything happens or not if there are other human beings they're willing to join in they will.

103
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:52,939
Speaker 0: you know if uber con canceled and Ten guys still showed up anyway They would get rooms in the hotel and play board games on those tables in the hotel rooms or set up a little campaign And play the whole weekend.

104
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:59,220
Speaker 1: Well because of this uber con looks like they're going to expand because ever con as far as I can tell has been very successful.

105
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:09,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, they definitely need a little bigger main room and well They're not expanding in New Jersey You see since they can't have their normal spring uber con this year.

106
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:18,402
Speaker 1: Instead they have announced uber con Great Lakes one, which is going to be held in Livonia, Michigan March 30th through April 1st 2007.

107
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:23,260
Speaker 0: I'm guessing that's just more convenient for some of the people running uber con who probably aren't living out there.

108
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Speaker 1: Well, I think this is going to be very interesting.

109
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,641
Speaker 1: I mean one.

110
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:32,580
Speaker 1: the first convention I ever went to period gaming con whatever was a gaming con called Michigan in Detroit.

111
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,469
Speaker 1: It was somewhere.

112
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:34,620
Speaker 1: I don't actually remember where it was.

113
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,996
Speaker 1: I was too young to even know where my dad drove me other than it was about 45 minutes away.

114
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,082
Speaker 0: Yeah,

115
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:52,759
Speaker 1: but I can tell you that in Michigan and in the Midwest in general there is a lot of gaming and there are a lot of little gaming cons and I think that an Organized this is like the Roman army marching into Gaul and setting up a little encampment.

116
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,690
Speaker 1: I think uber con Great Lakes is gonna do really well.

117
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,436
Speaker 1: Livonia is easy to get to thank.

118
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:58,520
Speaker 0: penguin con is out there.

119
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:04,240
Speaker 1: Yeah in Novi yep, but Livonia is easy to get to from pretty much anywhere in the Midwest.

120
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:08,738
Speaker 1: In fact, if we lived in Rochester, I would very much be inclined to go to this uber con.

121
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,351
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I think it's just too far away for us.

122
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:12,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not driving nine hours.

123
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,260
Speaker 0: There's enough gaming cons around here that I think we can replace spring uber con with a different gaming con.

124
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,505
Speaker 0: Maybe pick up two gaming cons.

125
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:19,887
Speaker 0: Who knows?

126
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:20,489
Speaker 1: Yep.

127
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,257
Speaker 1: Now, of course, they're still in the planning stages.

128
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:24,180
Speaker 1: They're looking for guests They're looking for all sorts of stuff.

129
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,740
Speaker 1: So to all our listeners in the Midwest go to the uber con website uber con calm and check this out.

130
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,757
Speaker 1: Uber con is a great con and I almost guarantee you won't be disappointed if you like gaming.

131
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,707
Speaker 0: if you don't like gaming Don't go don't like gaming.

132
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,500
Speaker 1: Why are you listening to Tuesday geek night?

133
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,006
Speaker 0: It could be just video game fans.

134
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,015
Speaker 0: uber con is very light on the video games.

135
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,160
Speaker 0: They got them but not much.

136
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

137
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:45,991
Speaker 1: They always have the guitar heroes in the DDR.

138
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,638
Speaker 0: Yep, and they have a little and party.

139
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:58,676
Speaker 0: Yeah all right, I don't have a gaming news because I already talked about how I'm buying Wario and Phoenix, right I'm gonna talk about a news that I should have talked about yesterday, but I didn't know it until today.

140
00:09:58,937 --> 00:09:59,479
Speaker 0: So tough shit.

141
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:04,615
Speaker 0: One of the best books ever is diamond age by Neal Stephenson.

142
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:05,438
Speaker 0: It's a really good book.

143
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:06,060
Speaker 0: It's real good.

144
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,682
Speaker 0: You should read it.

145
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,470
Speaker 0: If you haven't read it go read it.

146
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,940
Speaker 1: the gods conspired to force Scott to read it.

147
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was real good too.

148
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,614
Speaker 1: And finally he basically told all those.

149
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:18,168
Speaker 1: All right, you jackasses I'm finally gonna read this book so you'll shut up.

150
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,477
Speaker 1: and then he said oh, that was a good book.

151
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:33,740
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I've always thought that it should be made into like a really good movie or like a 26-episode show or something like that because it could be pulled off really well if done right the sci-fi channel is gonna try

152
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:36,698
Speaker 1: If you'd said anyone else

153
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:45,090
Speaker 0: They're gonna try to make a diamond age mini series with executive producers George Clooney Darren star and mark Burnett, whatever whatever.

154
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,234
Speaker 0: All right, we'll see Sci-fi channel is really six hour mini series.

155
00:10:50,716 --> 00:11:00,279
Speaker 0: if I'll get it pretty much I think my plan on this is I'll get like the first episode on bit Torrance or something And if it's good, I'll buy like the DVD set or Netflix it or something like that.

156
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,588
Speaker 0: Cuz they always make DVD sets of these things.

157
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you don't have to watch this shit on TV.

158
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,173
Speaker 1: I mean nowadays shows like this practically especially if it's six hours.

159
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:13,259
Speaker 0: I mean if it's a six hour mini series Why would I watch it on?

160
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:19,529
Speaker 0: TV with all those commercials making it take eight hours of my time See nine hours of my 50/50 on it.

161
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:28,020
Speaker 1: because on one hand it seems like there's some talent involved And I think the people who run the sci-fi channel know that if they screw this up, they'll generally be hated forever.

162
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:31,879
Speaker 1: But at the same time the side I turned up Earthsea and they they're not.

163
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:37,200
Speaker 1: Well, the sci-fi channel is not known for its high quality original content.

164
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:41,500
Speaker 1: No, not really other than Stargate SG-1, which I think is awesome.

165
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,893
Speaker 1: However, I want to clarify that by saying that it is not good.

166
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,560
Speaker 1: It is just awesome.

167
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:51,344
Speaker 0: I'm just generally not a fan of most Sci-fi television.

168
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,797
Speaker 1: Yeah says the man who doesn't like Firefly or Battlestar Galactica.

169
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:56,278
Speaker 1: Yep.

170
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,350
Speaker 0: All right So we'll see if this is any good.

171
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,780
Speaker 0: cuz I really like diamond age.

172
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,686
Speaker 0: So I want to lie or I?

173
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:10,586
Speaker 0: well it's not so much that I want to like it's I want there to be a video of diamond age that I like and We'll see if this is it or not.

174
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:23,766
Speaker 0: I give it a 60% chance of not being painful to watch Things of the day.

175
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:26,053
Speaker 1: now, I know yesterday last night.

176
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:29,759
Speaker 1: I said that I had two awesome Japanese video things of the day.

177
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:39,680
Speaker 1: well I'm afraid I'm gonna have to postpone the Super double Trump awesome one till tomorrow since I think tomorrow's demographic would enjoy it more so than tonight's demographic.

178
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:41,366
Speaker 0: Oh, so what are you gonna give us?

179
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:49,260
Speaker 1: Well instead I'm gonna give us something that will give you something since we've both seen it That while it was an awesome thing of the day, it kind of slipped through the cracks for various reasons.

180
00:12:49,881 --> 00:13:00,599
Speaker 1: there's this video that some hick somewhere filmed of this snake hanging out and the snake obviously was up to no good because there's this little rabbit and The little rabbit is none too happy with this snake.

181
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:06,400
Speaker 0: Well, if I was a rabbit I would be happy with the snake either because the snake could probably you know Bite me and all sorts other nastiness.

182
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:14,779
Speaker 1: so the rabbit runs up in front of the snake and the snake goes to bite it and the Blings itself in a backflip through the air away from the snake and then charges it.

183
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:19,929
Speaker 0: That's pretty fast to move to avoid a snake bite, you know snakes are like This video got to be.

184
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,560
Speaker 0: you got to be quick to avoid that shit.

185
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:22,786
Speaker 1: This is pretty impressive.

186
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,780
Speaker 1: and this goes on for a while and the snake can't get a hold of this rabbit.

187
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,727
Speaker 1: The rabbit just bounding around and charging.

188
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:31,660
Speaker 1: finally the rabbit starts biting the snake and attacking the snake.

189
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:38,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, he goes around to the end of the snake that doesn't have the biting poison on it and he starts Attacking the back of the snake.

190
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,460
Speaker 1: now at this point the snake says fuck this and starts trying to get away.

191
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:42,996
Speaker 1: But the rabbits not done.

192
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,527
Speaker 1: The rabbit chases the steak.

193
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:47,396
Speaker 1: just watch the video and see what happens.

194
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:48,280
Speaker 1: This is great.

195
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:56,054
Speaker 0: The best part of this video is the hick is, you know, okay They're not the smartest people but you could tell this hick is a fun guy.

196
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:57,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would hang out with this guy.

197
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:58,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd be fun.

198
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,000
Speaker 0: Just hang around it for a little while.

199
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,209
Speaker 1: He's reacting to this in pretty much the same way.

200
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:04,238
Speaker 1: weird react to it just in a different accent.

201
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,565
Speaker 0: Yeah Cool guy.

202
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,397
Speaker 0: All right my thing today.

203
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:12,051
Speaker 0: Well You may or may not know about sodium now.

204
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,017
Speaker 0: a lot of times people say sodium.

205
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,080
Speaker 0: They mean salt.

206
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,786
Speaker 1: No, we don't mean that we don't mean that.

207
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,271
Speaker 0: so we mean sodium.

208
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:22,006
Speaker 0: the element sodium is a metal You can get.

209
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,620
Speaker 0: it is just sodium na on the periodic table.

210
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:28,839
Speaker 0: Now the thing about sodium is that due to its chemical properties it?

211
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,282
Speaker 0: Explodes.

212
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:35,343
Speaker 0: pretty much everything on the left-hand column of the periodic table of elements Explodes.

213
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:46,280
Speaker 0: the reason for that and I'm not going to go into all the details of the chemistry Is that the outermost ring of electrons and all of those elements in their default states has one electron?

214
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,660
Speaker 0: Therefore that one electron all in its own in the outermost ring is real easy to take away.

215
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:54,539
Speaker 0: In fact, it wants to get away.

216
00:14:54,941 --> 00:15:00,620
Speaker 0: So if you put anything near some sodium or some cesium or whatever else mean it friends him.

217
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, that can take an electron such as water.

218
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:07,280
Speaker 0: There are lots of chemicals that can take an electron real easily.

219
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,990
Speaker 1: Yeah water, however, really really likes to take electron.

220
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,793
Speaker 0: Yeah water works.

221
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:14,789
Speaker 0: Some things work better some things work worse But water likes to take an electron.

222
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,240
Speaker 0: so you put some water near some sodium.

223
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,289
Speaker 0: The electron flies off the sodium into the water.

224
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:28,183
Speaker 0: in that process energy is released in great quantity with great rapidness and that makes Explosions.

225
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:37,360
Speaker 0: now we've seen a lot of videos of various experiments of this kind taking Yeah, we saw those guys the British guys on that show with the bathtub and they put cesium in the bathtub and ran away.

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've had at least one or more things of the day involving this exact item.

227
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,200
Speaker 0: Yep Well, this one is incredibly interesting.

228
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:54,839
Speaker 0: basically in 1947 after the war They had a bunch of sodium left over and they couldn't get anyone to take it because no one would ship it because it would explode.

229
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,206
Speaker 0: So they had big barrels full of sodium.

230
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:00,933
Speaker 0: They know what to do it and there was some water.

231
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,758
Speaker 0: It was an alkaline lake.

232
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:09,759
Speaker 0: So Basically on the eastern side of Washington State closer to Montana and such or I guess Idaho is in the way, right?

233
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,193
Speaker 0: It must be I don't know.

234
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:13,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Idaho and then month.

235
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:13,909
Speaker 0: Okay.

236
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a Washington, Idaho, Monta.

237
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,128
Speaker 0: Anyway way out in eastern Washington State, you know, which is on the west side of the country There was a lake that was alkaline.

238
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:24,352
Speaker 0: There were no fish in the lake.

239
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:28,319
Speaker 0: The lake didn't have anything living in it It was just bad water.

240
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:38,784
Speaker 0: so they dropped the sodium into it a barrel at a time and it exploded and someone decided to take a video of it with a 1947 film camera.

241
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:41,409
Speaker 1: basically, he was a primitive youtuber.

242
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:45,559
Speaker 0: Yep, and Now his video is on Google video instead of YouTube.

243
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,003
Speaker 0: it's fairly impressive.

244
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:49,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I've seen sodium explode.

245
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,999
Speaker 0: I mean at summer camp, you know, we threw a chunk of it into the lake, you know We would do all kinds of stuff with it.

246
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,309
Speaker 0: This is the biggest sodium explosion ever seen.

247
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:06,575
Speaker 1: So we'd said last week that we were going to review battle lore But I think we're going to wait another week just so I can play the game a few more times before I decide I really Don't like the game.

248
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

249
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,532
Speaker 0: Well, there are a lot of features of the game We haven't played with.

250
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:14,609
Speaker 0: we didn't play with the goblins or the dwarves or the monsters or the war council?

251
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:15,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, though.

252
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:18,589
Speaker 1: I have a pretty good idea of what kinds of effects those will have on the game.

253
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a pretty good idea as well.

254
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:22,165
Speaker 0: I already played with the goblins actually by rim didn't.

255
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:27,069
Speaker 1: so yeah Yeah, so we'll wait on that and we decided instead we'd do a nice little quick game.

256
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:35,537
Speaker 1: You see over our New Year's party our good friends James and Lisa came up from Texas to spend time with us and with him James brought a blockus.

257
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,030
Speaker 1: the two-player variant of blockus is travel blockus.

258
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,310
Speaker 1: Effectively the two-player variant because you player normal blockus is terrible.

259
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:46,330
Speaker 1: Basically, you can buy the four player and the two player.

260
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:56,230
Speaker 0: Yeah The default version of blockus is a four player game and you could play with two players Which is kind of sucky or you could play with three players, which is really sucky and unplayable.

261
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,756
Speaker 0: I don't even know why.

262
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:03,583
Speaker 0: they offer it as an option and Travel blockus Actually offers a really good two-player experience.

263
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:05,210
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's pretty cool.

264
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:14,924
Speaker 1: So blockus, it is a game put out by a strata gems brain building games And they're really touting it as an award-winning educational awesome game.

265
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:16,610
Speaker 1: I mean wasn't it up for a spiel this yar?

266
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:17,833
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a spiel.

267
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:18,495
Speaker 0: discern nominee.

268
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:19,258
Speaker 0: It's some year.

269
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:24,572
Speaker 1: It won the doctor toy 100 best children's product of 2003.

270
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:29,790
Speaker 0: You can never easy tell once you see this game why it wouldn't so many awards because it has such a broad appeal.

271
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,530
Speaker 1: It won the Oppenheim toy portfolio best toy award.

272
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:37,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it really kind of fits both into that.

273
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:38,949
Speaker 0: Toys R Us, you know market.

274
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:44,310
Speaker 1: but Mensa decided to endorse it - I don't like Mensa so much either.

275
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,098
Speaker 0: But also it fits into the.

276
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,570
Speaker 0: you know, German board gamers are also like playing this thing.

277
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,510
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is it's really hard to find a two-player game.

278
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,877
Speaker 1: That's good and block is at least.

279
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:55,562
Speaker 1: the two-player variant definitely fills the role.

280
00:18:55,602 --> 00:19:04,085
Speaker 1: now blockus is a very very Simple to play game, but that does not mean that it is a strategically or tactically simple game.

281
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:05,489
Speaker 0: Nope, not at all.

282
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:07,577
Speaker 1: Basically, you will have.

283
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:10,449
Speaker 1: well, we'll talk about the two-player one because they're always effectively the same.

284
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:13,750
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott and I there's a little bore with a bunch of squares on it.

285
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:19,479
Speaker 1: in addition, you're given each player a whole bunch of Tetris like pieces.

286
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:24,723
Speaker 1: they're called pentominoes Comprised of various squares and various numbers of squares.

287
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:26,690
Speaker 1: you get a whole bunch of them and you both get the same kinds.

288
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:39,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you've got you know The standard the t-shaped piece the plus piece the square piece the long L the short L the really short L. Yeah, you've got a whole bunch of pieces that are five squares large.

289
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,130
Speaker 0: You've got a few pieces that are four squares large.

290
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:47,250
Speaker 0: You got like a couple that are three squares like a one that's two and one that's one.

291
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have only one one piece which actually comes into play rather significantly.

292
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:59,584
Speaker 1: Yep Now the way the game goes is you take turns starting from your designated starting position Placing these in a way that they fit on the board.

293
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:01,070
Speaker 1: and the rules of placement are very simple.

294
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:04,829
Speaker 1: You cannot place a piece so that it goes over another piece.

295
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:09,464
Speaker 0: Obviously it has to fit on the board in empty squares - outside of your first piece.

296
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:16,529
Speaker 1: any additional pieces you play throughout the rest of the game must be Diagonally adjacent so the corners must touch.

297
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:20,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if I put down the T I Guess I can't.

298
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:24,010
Speaker 0: the corner of the piece that I put down has to touch a corner of the next piece.

299
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,597
Speaker 0: I put yes diagonally speaking.

300
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:33,610
Speaker 1: now the third most important rule and this is where the game is interesting Is that no piece of the same color may be orthogonally adjacent?

301
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:42,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you can't have any of your pieces actually touching any of your other pieces So they'll all be all these diagonal holes all over the place.

302
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:50,945
Speaker 1: Yeah So say you've got two one pieces and you want to somehow even though you can't have those you want to connect them to each other and you've got a nine grid of nine squares and the first piece is in the middle.

303
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:54,881
Speaker 1: the second piece can only Go in the top right top left bottom right or bottom left.

304
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,488
Speaker 1: Those are the only possible legal placements Yep.

305
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:03,879
Speaker 1: And the object of the game is to get as many of your pieces on the board as you can Before you run out of legal moves.

306
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:05,649
Speaker 1: your opponent is trying to do the same.

307
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,859
Speaker 1: Scoring is very very simple.

308
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,872
Speaker 1: you get negative one point You start at zero.

309
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,781
Speaker 1: you get negative one point for every block.

310
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:18,084
Speaker 1: that comprises every piece that you still have Unplaced at the end of the game.

311
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:18,548
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

312
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,890
Speaker 1: So if I have a square piece and a Tetris T piece left, then I have a score of negative eight.

313
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:32,430
Speaker 1: Yep, additionally, you can get a five point bonus If the last piece you play is your smallest one piece.

314
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:41,389
Speaker 0: Now the reason they have that rule is because the one piece is very useful because it is only one square large It's pretty easy to play it at any point in the game.

315
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:47,809
Speaker 0: However, there are many situations where you will be able to play the one piece in order to sort of break out.

316
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:49,950
Speaker 0: and do You know add more pieces to the board.

317
00:21:50,371 --> 00:22:05,609
Speaker 0: So if you keep playing in a fashion in which you never need the one piece to break out Which means it's more difficult for you and that you can just save that Powerful one piece and not actually use it to break out but just put it at the end Then you get five points for doing that

318
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:16,110
Speaker 1: but at the same time there might be an incentive to use the one piece early because There is also a 15 point bonus if you somehow place all of your pieces on the board.

319
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:16,968
Speaker 1: Whoa?

320
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:24,245
Speaker 1: So the maximum possible score is 20 and that is if you place all your pieces on the board and you place the one piece last.

321
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:30,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you can't put any more pieces on the board possibly by any amount of rules That's the game.

322
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:38,223
Speaker 0: just you're just done until and then other people keep putting pieces until no one can put any more pieces Legally and then games over now.

323
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:39,369
Speaker 1: That's really it.

324
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,330
Speaker 1: That's the entire game and you to go back and forth until you both can't place pieces anymore.

325
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:48,244
Speaker 1: The three player game in the or the four player game are pretty much the same.

326
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,090
Speaker 1: They just have rules to deal with that.

327
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,189
Speaker 1: I mean the travel version of the game.

328
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,938
Speaker 1: You just play two players straight up.

329
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:55,486
Speaker 1: in the full version.

330
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,979
Speaker 1: to play two players Each of you has to use two colors.

331
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:59,025
Speaker 1: So you have two of every piece.

332
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,030
Speaker 1: just so the board.

333
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,210
Speaker 0: I just realized something.

334
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:10,104
Speaker 0: There's no reason why we couldn't just cut out a section of the big board in the four player version Put those dots on it and then play it just like the travel.

335
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:10,607
Speaker 0: You know what?

336
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:11,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, not at all You know what?

337
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:16,065
Speaker 1: All we should do is take a marker and mark what the small board would be.

338
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:16,627
Speaker 0: Yeah.

339
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,334
Speaker 0: Yeah something like that All right, great.

340
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't even have to mark up the whole thing.

341
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:21,288
Speaker 0: Just the corners.

342
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,239
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah We'll just put little dots like a little go board or something.

343
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but yeah, it's fun block.

344
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,730
Speaker 1: This is incredibly fun unless you try to play it three player and then it's just annoying.

345
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, three player because then you actually have to play the fourth player.

346
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:40,484
Speaker 0: Just everyone takes turns being the fourth player and the fourth player doesn't count.

347
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,350
Speaker 0: So it really kind of sucks.

348
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:51,090
Speaker 1: Now, I guess we'll talk about the two-player game because it's a lot like all those games You'd play as a kid like pick up the sticks on a piece of paper or any of those two-player game.

349
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:51,793
Speaker 0: I think it's a lot.

350
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:55,290
Speaker 0: It's a lot more like Tron and Tetris kind of combined.

351
00:23:56,132 --> 00:24:08,206
Speaker 1: No, but see the way I look at it as the pick up sticks game is that the pick up sticks game is a game of stable and unstable states and Any time you move you can put the game into a stable or an unstable state.

352
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:15,249
Speaker 1: and in a game You generally want to put it in a state that prevents the other player from putting it into a state that is desirable to them.

353
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:22,588
Speaker 1: and in this game Like say I'm building toward the center of the board and Scott is building toward the center of the board.

354
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,407
Speaker 1: now I have a choice to jump in aggressively or hold back a little bit.

355
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:40,312
Speaker 1: now I might jump in aggressively and take control that part of the board or I might jump in aggressively but haphazardly and then Scott will be able to counter-attack and Place a piece that blocks all four corners or all three corners or whatever of the piece I place

356
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:42,118
Speaker 0: like there's a u-shaped piece, right?

357
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,450
Speaker 0: So let's say rim puts down his his stick piece.

358
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,801
Speaker 0: It's five just five squares right in a row.

359
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:55,010
Speaker 0: if I put that you piece So that his stick piece goes right into the middle of my you piece like a cup like a stick going into a cup.

360
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:03,889
Speaker 0: that kind of screws him because now I just cut off the corners of that stick piece and I've Basically prevented him from making any more moves in that direction at all.

361
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:13,383
Speaker 0: It's that's why I feel it's kind of like Tron because you're sort of drawing this line around your territory But the line isn't really solid.

362
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:14,589
Speaker 0: you've kind of got a you know.

363
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:20,330
Speaker 0: Lock the territory in you know, and then you can use up your part of the board filling it in, you know.

364
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,868
Speaker 0: And whoever has the biggest area can beat the other guy.

365
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:31,590
Speaker 1: Yep There is definitely a general strategy of try to wall off an area for yourself And then at the same time try to get inside the other person's area to mess up their strategy.

366
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:44,099
Speaker 0: yeah, what often happens is you'll wall off an area, but not completely but enough and You'll then what you'll have that area semi walled off You'll try to break into someone else's area and you might succeed.

367
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,661
Speaker 0: but every time you're playing one piece of turn Everyone is playing one piece of turn.

368
00:25:50,043 --> 00:26:00,750
Speaker 0: so you often have to decide all right, I can put a piece here and move in on rims area or Alex sitting next to me, you know, he's gonna put a piece in my area.

369
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:06,069
Speaker 0: So I can either block him and be defensive or go on the offense against rim.

370
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:12,569
Speaker 0: but I have to figure out which one of those two moves is Gonna end up with me having the most pieces on the board at the end.

371
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:16,650
Speaker 1: This is definitely one of those minute to learn lifetime to master games.

372
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,846
Speaker 1: I mean anyone will learn how to play this game in about two minutes.

373
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:21,970
Speaker 0: little kids are playing this game.

374
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:22,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could.

375
00:26:22,994 --> 00:26:27,229
Speaker 1: I could probably teach a monkey to at least play the game without breaking the rules.

376
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:33,312
Speaker 0: It had to be one of the smarter monkeys like attempt, but you could yeah do easily The.

377
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:39,017
Speaker 1: despite that the game does not bog down or become a foregone conclusion at all At least in all the experience.

378
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:41,090
Speaker 1: we or many of the other people playing this game of head.

379
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:44,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you won't stop in the middle of the game and be like, oh rim one.

380
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,350
Speaker 0: Oh, it's got one.

381
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, you play to the end and then you go.

382
00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:51,004
Speaker 1: One of the more recent four-player games we played.

383
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:52,190
Speaker 1: I was winning.

384
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:57,370
Speaker 1: Everyone on the board except Alex said wow rims gonna win no matter what he's put almost all his pieces out.

385
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,601
Speaker 1: He's got this big walled off area and Alex is just being real quiet.

386
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:04,955
Speaker 1: and then Alex proceeds to place Practically all of his pieces.

387
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:10,173
Speaker 1: like I didn't think he did place all of his pieces kick our asses into the ground and none of Us saw it coming.

388
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:13,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that was the first time we played with someone who put all the pieces down.

389
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,655
Speaker 0: It was kind of crazy.

390
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:15,580
Speaker 0: We're like, ah shit.

391
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:15,942
Speaker 0: Fuck.

392
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:23,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game is definitely not easy to be very good at and The only way to get good at it seems to be is just to play it.

393
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:26,033
Speaker 1: enough to start recognizing patterns Like.

394
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:29,470
Speaker 1: there are certain configurations that make it very easy for a person to break through.

395
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:39,287
Speaker 1: In fact, if you look at a picture of the board It's pretty obvious that due to the way pieces are allowed to be laid It is very easy to break into places and very hard to prevent people from doing so.

396
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:40,853
Speaker 0: Yep It's it's.

397
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:45,490
Speaker 0: the thing I like about it is that it feels like it's the same sort of game as go.

398
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,450
Speaker 0: Well, you know with the everyone has the same rate of tile of placement of pieces.

399
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:59,150
Speaker 0: You can put them not anywhere liking go but you know you put them on this board That's a grid and you're trying to acquire territory and wall the other guy off and such.

400
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:03,250
Speaker 0: But you don't have the same sort of suffering you have with go.

401
00:28:05,232 --> 00:28:09,849
Speaker 0: You know, it's like even if you're sucking you're still getting somewhere you're still feeling good about it.

402
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:11,522
Speaker 0: You know, you're having fun.

403
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:17,870
Speaker 0: just you know Not even trying to beat the other people but just looking for places to put pieces is fun on its own.

404
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:23,130
Speaker 1: This game also has the great benefit that is incredibly quick to play quick to set up quick to tear down.

405
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,202
Speaker 1: You can just sit down and knock off ten rounds of this with me.

406
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:29,214
Speaker 0: the official playing time is 20 minutes And I think that's laughable.

407
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:30,860
Speaker 0: They mean the playing time is five minutes.

408
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:33,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially two players who know how to play the game.

409
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:39,010
Speaker 0: It's just better than it and the game's over and then and even then if the game's over you feel like playing it again.

410
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,635
Speaker 0: I mean we played that two-player version.

411
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:43,083
Speaker 1: how many times God over the New Year's party.

412
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:45,030
Speaker 1: the game saw pretty much constant play.

413
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, just people kept playing.

414
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:47,199
Speaker 0: it kept playing.

415
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:47,801
Speaker 0: it kept playing it.

416
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:49,207
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you're playing.

417
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:50,010
Speaker 0: keep playing.

418
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,161
Speaker 0: It's like you play the game.

419
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:57,288
Speaker 0: you fill up the board You dump all the pieces off and you do it again and it's just as fun as the last time perhaps more fun now.

420
00:28:57,328 --> 00:29:00,813
Speaker 1: the production values of the game are also Incredibly high.

421
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:01,756
Speaker 1: quality the piece.

422
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:08,860
Speaker 0: I don't know about that compared to how much it costs and I was simple The game the price is right for what you get.

423
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,425
Speaker 0: I mean the game is officially $20.

424
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:10,665
Speaker 0: we paid 10.

425
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,649
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but got it grid.

426
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:19,170
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a cheap plastic grid, but it has ridges and the pieces have indentations in them.

427
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,474
Speaker 1: So the pieces just lock in.

428
00:29:20,735 --> 00:29:21,919
Speaker 0: yep, perfectly.

429
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:25,030
Speaker 0: They just fit and they're nice plastic translucent pieces.

430
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,999
Speaker 0: You can tell the colors apart real easily.

431
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:27,079
Speaker 0: Yep.

432
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,365
Speaker 1: Everything's very uniform.

433
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:29,409
Speaker 0: They feel really nice.

434
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:31,739
Speaker 0: The thing is for an abstract game.

435
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:37,750
Speaker 0: usually a lot of people like the super gamers They like to have you know, like the fancy wooden piece and stuff.

436
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:43,880
Speaker 0: That's why you'll see a lot of these abstract games that know an abstract game is a game That doesn't have a theme like ticket to ride has a theme.

437
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,563
Speaker 0: It's trains.

438
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:45,988
Speaker 0: Puerto Rico has a theme.

439
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,616
Speaker 0: It's people trading goods in Puerto Rico.

440
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:50,241
Speaker 0: blockus doesn't have a theme.

441
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:51,224
Speaker 0: It's squares.

442
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:52,347
Speaker 0: See, I don't know liars.

443
00:29:52,387 --> 00:29:54,357
Speaker 0: dice doesn't have a theme It's just dice.

444
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:03,590
Speaker 1: when a game gets abstract enough I actually enjoy it more if it doesn't have a theme because then I don't mean I don't feel Bound by but that's the definition of an abstract game.

445
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,996
Speaker 0: It's just games without a theme.

446
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:15,479
Speaker 0: if you took Puerto Rico and you just changed it to be, you know Brown discs and you know yellow Wooden bits that would be considered an abstract game.

447
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:16,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, except the thing it will.

448
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,769
Speaker 1: yeah the game play itself like this.

449
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,358
Speaker 1: game Doesn't have a real world analog.

450
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:23,927
Speaker 1: Well, Puerto Rico very easily has a real world analog.

451
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,062
Speaker 1: Yep, Puerto Rico It's obvious build buildings.

452
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:40,566
Speaker 0: It makes sense Mechanically, yep, I mean like chess is considered to be an abstract game Even though there is a theme of knights and kings and things, you know, because the what the gameplay style is abstract Yes, but chess is less abstract feeling than blockus.

453
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:52,570
Speaker 0: It is However, most like I was saying gamers that the super gamers they tend to like the abstract games to have higher Production values than the themed games, you know, it's because the game is abstract.

454
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,262
Speaker 0: They feel sometimes that you know.

455
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:58,519
Speaker 0: since it's just simple pieces Why not make them real fancy?

456
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:00,430
Speaker 0: because you know, then they put them out as like display.

457
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:01,654
Speaker 1: See, I'm hit or miss on that.

458
00:31:01,674 --> 00:31:06,150
Speaker 1: I mean if I were hosting a symposium, I suppose I would like a really fancy thing.

459
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,346
Speaker 1: But the cheap looking nature of the game a coupled with the fact that while it may look cheap.

460
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:16,081
Speaker 1: It's functionally perfect Really is conducive to just knocking the game out playing it.

461
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:16,483
Speaker 1: Whatever.

462
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:16,864
Speaker 0: Yep.

463
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,150
Speaker 0: The thing is a lot of people.

464
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:22,570
Speaker 0: I know some people they buy abstract games because they look pretty and they'll just leave them out on a table.

465
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:25,870
Speaker 0: It's sort of like a decoration like some people leave a chess set just lying.

466
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:28,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, this is not a game you can do that with.

467
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:32,401
Speaker 0: this is a game that for playing No, they might one day make a version of blockus.

468
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:34,370
Speaker 0: That is like fancy wooden blockus.

469
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:39,395
Speaker 1: We should get a chess set or something and leave it out and have an ongoing game But I don't like chess.

470
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:42,389
Speaker 1: Well, I don't like just that much either, but I enjoy playing it.

471
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,135
Speaker 0: I don't really enjoy playing it that much.

472
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:48,249
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it's alright, but maybe we could do that with some other game.

473
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:50,027
Speaker 1: Anyway, I digress.

474
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:51,392
Speaker 1: The.

475
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:58,693
Speaker 1: the other nice thing about this game is that because it's so simply done the pieces are super bright super Contrasting.

476
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:07,470
Speaker 1: so if you're sitting there playing you can very very readily Just glance at the board and all of your abstract thinking comes together real quick.

477
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:11,185
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I spend a lot more time thinking in this game than other people.

478
00:32:11,226 --> 00:32:13,390
Speaker 1: That's just god damn It's god spends too much.

479
00:32:13,754 --> 00:32:22,412
Speaker 0: I think the thing is in this game You could take your turn in like less than 30 seconds easily and I actually sometimes spend your turn shouldn't take more than 10 seconds In this game.

480
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:26,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually sometimes spend maybe a minute thinking about what I'm gonna do on my turn.

481
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:31,369
Speaker 0: just cuz I'm trying real hard That's but I'm still not winning so much.

482
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,077
Speaker 1: See this game is definitely.

483
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:41,050
Speaker 1: the main skills you need are the ability to Put forth abstract predictions in an unpredictable board based on mathematical probabilities.

484
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:45,775
Speaker 1: You definitely need to have a good sense of spatial relationships Mm-hmm.

485
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,449
Speaker 0: I think that's the number one thing you need.

486
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:48,390
Speaker 1: I don't know.

487
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:54,636
Speaker 1: I think it's a mix of the two because even if you have a good sense of the spatial relationships if you can't predict where Other people are going to want to go.

488
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:57,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't say it's the only thing is it's the number one thing.

489
00:32:57,469 --> 00:33:06,201
Speaker 1: Yeah But the thing the problem here is that people like Scott can sit there forever Holding pieces over the board and rotating morale.

490
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:15,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, well see even that even if you let me spend time doing that It's not gonna help that much because you still need to look turns and turns in advance Which I don't do at all.

491
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:17,030
Speaker 1: See I do that very much.

492
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:20,383
Speaker 0: See I just look at the current turn because I can't be bothered.

493
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:22,210
Speaker 1: but therein lies the one problem with this game.

494
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:33,950
Speaker 1: If you are not of the bevagon school of gaming and you let people take as long as they want on your turn You will run into people with this game who will sit there and brute-force the best possible moves.

495
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:45,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll look at every single piece they have and they'll figure out every possible place They can put those pieces and it'll figure out what everyone else is gonna do on their turn if they do each and every move And then they'll make the best move.

496
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:58,310
Speaker 0: you if people are taking more like if people are taking more than a minute on their turn You really just say alright take your turn It's times up or else this game becomes unfun as people sit around going in.

497
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,110
Speaker 1: Yep, plus you'll text your brain a lot more if you force yourself to think quickly.

498
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's true for any game of perfect information and you know, that's what you got to do.

499
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:17,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I'm very much of the mind that when games are perfect information You generally should force people to take their turn more quickly and also force yourself to take your turn more quickly.

500
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:19,542
Speaker 1: You'll get smarter quicker.

501
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:22,833
Speaker 0: Yeah, just go if you don't feel bad.

502
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:32,750
Speaker 0: if you just made a move and you're not sure if that's the best move just go with your instinct and then Over time just keep playing it and your instinct will change to do something smarter next time.

503
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:34,556
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean Scott and I and a lot of our friends.

504
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:53,498
Speaker 1: just because we played so many of these board games it gets to The point with a lot of these games or even with games that are similar to games We've played where I'll make a move without a lot of thought and I'll feel like it was a really good move But I won't immediately be able to say why and then five minutes later well after my turn I'll realize that it was a good move

505
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,174
Speaker 0: and then you'll come back and say oh, you see that move I made five turns ago.

506
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,604
Speaker 0: I made that one because blah blah blah blah blah.

507
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:00,950
Speaker 0: Look how smart I was.

508
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:06,650
Speaker 0: I thought of why it was smart afterwards, but I'm gonna pretend like I knew why it was smart before I did it.

509
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:11,667
Speaker 1: Well with most games I mean with most games you do plan ahead like that.

510
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:12,410
Speaker 1: just you do it quickly.

511
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,750
Speaker 1: But you can get an instinct where there will be certain situations where you'll see a pattern arising.

512
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,017
Speaker 0: But I'm making it funny.

513
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:21,009
Speaker 0: You're not supposed to like just start talking about something else.

514
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:22,445
Speaker 0: It's so fair.

515
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:26,402
Speaker 0: You can't do that because I'm like a duck.

516
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:30,011
Speaker 0: what Whatever?

517
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:31,515
Speaker 0: yeah, okay.

518
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:36,510
Speaker 1: But anyway, like once you figure our game out like that doesn't have to be in Tigers new phrase anymore.

519
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,589
Speaker 1: I just I know what I'm doing straight up because we played the game so much

520
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:39,991
Speaker 0: Yep,

521
00:35:40,272 --> 00:36:01,689
Speaker 1: but when he first started playing Tigers new phrase because we played so many abstract games I'd see patterns that seem like they were good patterns but I wasn't sure why like certain checkerboard configurations of red and black seemed really really powerful and they worked really really well or certain placements always seem to win the game and certain uses of disasters always seem to be much better than other ones.

522
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:07,390
Speaker 1: and Then as we played the game more I figured out why those patterns worked and then I was able to use them even more effectively.

523
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:15,588
Speaker 1: But by forcing yourself to take your turn more quickly You'll start to get the sense of these patterns more readily in other games you play.

524
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:23,470
Speaker 0: Yep I think the biggest thing in block is that I've still like got to try to get down is Early on in the game when you can make just about any move you want.

525
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,869
Speaker 0: Those are some of the most important moves in the game.

526
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:29,279
Speaker 0: But you also have the least information with which to make those moves.

527
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:39,790
Speaker 0: because especially, you know, if you're going first It's like what piece you put down first as the game progresses from most freedom least information to most information least freedom.

528
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:42,058
Speaker 0: Yep, the other thing is that's a common game.

529
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:45,270
Speaker 0: I think going first has the tiniest advantage.

530
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,417
Speaker 1: I think it does especially in the four-player game.

531
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,343
Speaker 1: going going early has a slight advantage.

532
00:36:49,363 --> 00:36:51,992
Speaker 0: in the two-player game going first doesn't buy It that much.

533
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:57,310
Speaker 1: in fact, it might be possible that going first is not actually an advantage in two-player against a skilled player.

534
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:58,341
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not sure yet.

535
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:59,169
Speaker 1: I got to play the game more.

536
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could be like Othello where it doesn't matter if you go first or second.

537
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:06,756
Speaker 1: now having played the game enough and Especially having done well in the last few games.

538
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:10,810
Speaker 1: I think I figured out a basic and somewhat counterintuitive strategy.

539
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,090
Speaker 0: All right, let's let's hear your fancy strategy.

540
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:16,416
Speaker 1: All right now I've cemented this strategy a little bit.

541
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:38,794
Speaker 1: having now actually looked at the instruction book and actually looked at the back of the board and I noticed that all the examples do this - it seems like everyone's initial idea especially in the four-player game is to try to Like wall off an area that they that they generally have them a decent amount of control over and then try to build inside that area later After they've built.

542
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:45,197
Speaker 0: to the extent of that's what I've done and I'm beginning to think it's it's a better idea to walk to now Build in that area a little bit earlier.

543
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:47,648
Speaker 1: Here's why in my opinion that idea fails.

544
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,429
Speaker 1: one You've walled off an area, but you won't be able to fully deny all other players access to that area.

545
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:59,466
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm - you'll have wasted some of your useful pieces walling that area off.

546
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:00,048
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm

547
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:14,007
Speaker 1: three And this is the part that I took me a while to realize if you've walled off an area You won't be able to make very efficient use of it because it is very difficult to place any Significant number of your pieces anywhere near each other due to the orthogonal rules.

548
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:17,882
Speaker 1: Yep So no matter how big of an area you wall off You're gonna waste most of that space.

549
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:18,750
Speaker 1: then people are gonna run in.

550
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:26,310
Speaker 1: Hmm a much better strategy is to spider off with long thin chains in every possible direction you can.

551
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:32,790
Speaker 1: That way you always have a front of expansion and it's very easy to expand inside of other players domains.

552
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:36,490
Speaker 0: In fact, the thing is if everyone does that right?

553
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:44,596
Speaker 0: I mean that strategy kind of works because other people are walling off these areas and you can just reach for the other players Areas and try to infiltrate them.

554
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,950
Speaker 0: What if everyone's trying to reach and everyone else's hair?

555
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,990
Speaker 0: Then you just sort of get it these crazy things going everywhere and it's just gonna become this piece is all over the place.

556
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,135
Speaker 0: Where am I gonna fit another one?

557
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:55,919
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know what?

558
00:38:56,019 --> 00:39:00,418
Speaker 1: I think that among for advanced players Almost every game will look like that.

559
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,370
Speaker 1: I don't think the walled garden strategy works at all.

560
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:04,452
Speaker 0: Yeah I have.

561
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:04,653
Speaker 0: no.

562
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:09,250
Speaker 0: I do agree that when you do manage to wall off a garden and begin filling it with pieces.

563
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:22,088
Speaker 0: It is very difficult to efficiently fill it with as many of your pieces as possible also because number one Controlling the shape of the garden is rather difficult because that is just a circumstance of the way in which you walled it off.

564
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:30,529
Speaker 0: and two because you don't have a lot of time to pick up all your pieces and figure out the most efficient way to lay all of them out within the area.

565
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:38,339
Speaker 0: and Three because you can only put one in your area at a time and by the time you're you know done filling up the area Someone might have put something in there.

566
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:39,909
Speaker 1: and now there's more than that.

567
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:47,927
Speaker 1: I don't think it's just that someone might fill in the air A foregone conclusion that someone else is gonna get into your area and use it more efficiently than you will yep.

568
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:52,083
Speaker 1: more importantly Be you feel like your walled garden is safe.

569
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:54,273
Speaker 1: You can wait and fill it in later It's.

570
00:39:54,313 --> 00:40:06,462
Speaker 1: yet if you go into someone else's area It's even safer counterintuitively because They are not free to place their pieces within their own area because they're constrained by the orthogonal placement rules Mm-hmm.

571
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:22,028
Speaker 1: So you can build into someone's area and then ignore that because they cannot place a piece that will block you and then you fill That in at the end and then you work on infiltrating someone else's area and the moment you get you're in you don't bother building There anymore because there's nothing they can do to stop you.

572
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:31,059
Speaker 1: And you go in every direction you can where someone can't stop you and you only fill in the places where someone can stop You when you don't have any other places to expand.

573
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,990
Speaker 0: Yep, like definitely is the sound strategy.

574
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:53,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, and just looking at all the examples I've seen of perfectly filled boards and victory conditions and people who have placed all their pieces I have not seen a Substantial victory or a a victory that looked like it was against other people who are equally intelligent That involved a any sort of walled garden.

575
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:58,130
Speaker 0: Yep I'm looking at this completely filled board and it seems like everyone.

576
00:40:58,852 --> 00:41:03,829
Speaker 0: It's sort of like if you cut the board in half Diagonally, right then like blue will take up.

577
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:18,009
Speaker 0: you know all their pieces are in like the bottom right half and Red is in the top right half and yellow is in the bottom left and green is in the top left You know and they sort of you sort of need half the board Diagonally speaking to fit all your pieces.

578
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:26,845
Speaker 0: So and usually someone from another area of the board is gonna come in to you know One of the areas and then you're gonna go into someone else's.

579
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:27,750
Speaker 0: and that's how it's gonna be.

580
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:38,444
Speaker 0: But you can still fit your pieces because the way the rules are for placing them as long as you place them in ways In which they're very close, you know, it's like you got to be real snug.

581
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:39,990
Speaker 0: if you want to fit as many as possible.

582
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, the four players filling the board thing.

583
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,750
Speaker 1: I don't think can happen among four players.

584
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,241
Speaker 1: I think that can only happen with one player playing the brainteaser variant.

585
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:48,622
Speaker 0: Yep.

586
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:51,090
Speaker 0: I think that's also unless four players are trying.

587
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even that's just not gonna happen.

588
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,513
Speaker 0: No, but income.

589
00:41:54,573 --> 00:42:07,824
Speaker 0: I think the idea though is if you want to fit more pieces in you want to be real snug right up against people plus that if you're right up against other people's pieces That usually hurts them a lot because it makes them much more difficult for them to play.

590
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:09,611
Speaker 1: anything doesn't always hurt as much as you Think.

591
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:10,335
Speaker 1: not always.

592
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:13,510
Speaker 1: right up next to them are the places where they couldn't place anyway.

593
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:19,897
Speaker 1: Yes, but if you're right up next to them on the edges see I think in general It looks like most of the people we've played with.

594
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:25,158
Speaker 1: whenever they see an opportunity to screw another player they'll always take it assuming that will benefit them.

595
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:39,870
Speaker 1: and I think because there are often times where you don't even want to worry about what the other play is doing because you're gonna get much more benefit from just building your own empire and letting them jump through because The pieces you're gonna have to spend to block them are only going to delay them and you're gonna waste useful pieces.

596
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:42,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always a question when attacking is okay.

597
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:45,390
Speaker 0: if I tack I'm gonna use this piece to attack them.

598
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:53,470
Speaker 0: Maybe while that piece is the best for attacking Maybe that piece is not the best for efficient placement of all my tiles.

599
00:42:54,152 --> 00:43:00,789
Speaker 0: So maybe I should play something else instead of attacking or do a lighter attack with a more efficient piece or something like that.

600
00:43:01,451 --> 00:43:11,319
Speaker 1: So I suppose considering that we've spent quite a while talking about the strategy of block is one of the sim proudly the simplest game We own Perhaps at least in terms of play.

601
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:12,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't have candy land.

602
00:43:12,946 --> 00:43:15,503
Speaker 0: No, we should get it though I think I own Yahtzee technically.

603
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,936
Speaker 1: Oh However Yahtzee you have to.

604
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:20,570
Speaker 1: you have to know a little bit about statistics a little bit.

605
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:30,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like Yahtzee though But despite how simple this game is we've spent quite a while talking about the deep strategic and tactical elements of it Even though it's just putting Tetris pieces on a board.

606
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:35,710
Speaker 1: So I think I can say with certainty that the vast majority of gamers will like this game.

607
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,305
Speaker 0: There's no reason the vast majority of non gamers will like this game.

608
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:40,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a great gift for kids.

609
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,796
Speaker 1: It's a great gift for anyone.

610
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:44,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, give it to your mom your dad your brother your sister.

611
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:54,210
Speaker 0: You know just if you go buy a copy of block is and the next time you visit your family bring it along and they'll Totally play it with you because even if they totally hate it you only took up ten minutes of their time.

612
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:59,070
Speaker 0: It's a lot easier to get someone to play block is for ten minutes than it is to get them to play something else.

613
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,790
Speaker 0: You know, I mean even tickets a ride which goes over real well with families and such.

614
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:06,861
Speaker 0: It takes a while to set it up and it takes a while to teach.

615
00:44:07,222 --> 00:44:08,567
Speaker 0: block is takes no time.

616
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:09,410
Speaker 0: It's like BAM.

617
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:12,452
Speaker 0: Let's go rock and roll Block and roll.
