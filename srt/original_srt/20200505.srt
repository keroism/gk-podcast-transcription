1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,731
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 5th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:12,172
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:14,499
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:26,667
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about the third of the 18xx games that we have actually played 1889 history of Shikoku railways from 2004. let's do this.

5
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,433
Speaker 0: How is this the third one?

6
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:29,517
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's the second one.

7
00:00:29,577 --> 00:00:39,500
Speaker 1: if we reviewed 1846 raised for the Midwest Yeah, and we also reviewed 2038 tycoons of the asteroid though, but I played this before I played 2038.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,365
Speaker 1: I also played this before I played 2038 and this this one I've only now.

9
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:48,392
Speaker 1: I've played this now three times But I'd only ever played it once when we got to the point of playing 2038.

10
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:53,337
Speaker 0: I've played this one I think maybe a few more times than you.

11
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:57,972
Speaker 1: yeah It's funny because I like this one more with.

12
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,759
Speaker 0: this is the one I've now played the most.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,800
Speaker 1: yeah I like this one more when I will get to in the review.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,969
Speaker 1: I like it more when I'm playing the beginning in the middle of the game But 1846 still has a more pleasant endgame.

15
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:13,907
Speaker 0: I mean that's true for me for most games Period the beginnings are fun.

16
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,373
Speaker 1: Yeah, I look forward to.

17
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:15,835
Speaker 1: I think that.

18
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,545
Speaker 1: sit that live sieve game We're playing the one on the fractal map.

19
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,454
Speaker 1: I feel like the continuation of that will be fun.

20
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:25,539
Speaker 0: I feel like I'm already Not doing great.

21
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:28,150
Speaker 1: Well all of us are not doing great.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,865
Speaker 1: as long as the Alliance of the three of us I don't know what out.

23
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,012
Speaker 0: What does Alex do that?

24
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:33,460
Speaker 0: He always has so much better.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,225
Speaker 0: He's better at the Sim City in than us.

26
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:35,967
Speaker 0: What is he doing?

27
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,050
Speaker 1: more cities faster?

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,199
Speaker 0: I built so many settlers this time.

29
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,771
Speaker 0: How many settlers I settled?

30
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:43,879
Speaker 1: maybe you're doing okay, then?

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,844
Speaker 0: No, I'm not my you know.

32
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,109
Speaker 0: look at the top right thingy.

33
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,554
Speaker 1: well join the Alliance.

34
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:49,839
Speaker 1: the Triple Alliance can't lose.

35
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:51,465
Speaker 0: Science is good.

36
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,817
Speaker 0: My science is good, but everything else is kind of me all right.

37
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:55,680
Speaker 1: well ally with me.

38
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:58,494
Speaker 1: We'll do some science alliances and get even more science.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,795
Speaker 1: mmm Giant death robots can beat an unlimited number of earlier units sure.

40
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,196
Speaker 1: So I need hammers the one thing you know in this whole quarantine.

41
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,200
Speaker 1: We're generally stuck at home.

42
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:14,217
Speaker 1: I get outside to run and bike but not much else.

43
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:20,200
Speaker 1: but The weird thing is on one hand there's almost no one driving like there is no traffic.

44
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:22,492
Speaker 1: It's to the point that New York feels weird.

45
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,140
Speaker 1: the I mostly hear birds.

46
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:29,898
Speaker 1: One car driving down the street is enough to stink up the whole street like you can smell it coming like.

47
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:33,370
Speaker 1: it's weird But despite there being almost no cars.

48
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,583
Speaker 1: It feels like there are way more car accidents Mmm.

49
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:45,958
Speaker 0: I have witnessed two car accidents like in the last week and a half Because almost everyone who's out there driving is like Oh empty road drive like a nut.

50
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,822
Speaker 1: yep I I'd.

51
00:02:46,863 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 1: so I think I have seen not the majority But like a good 30% of all the cars I've encountered while I'm out just running red lights with impunity because there's no cops anywhere Like people just roll into red lights, but those dirt bikes are everywhere.

52
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:05,360
Speaker 1: But I wondered is that just me noticing it because there's so few cars?

53
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:07,829
Speaker 1: Maybe there was this like there was a lot of accidents.

54
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:08,050
Speaker 1: another.

55
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,880
Speaker 0: so there were many such cars driving like that.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,832
Speaker 0: You know those people have been on the road.

57
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:16,611
Speaker 0: They were on the road last year But they're usually on the road late at night, or there's traffic.

58
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:18,580
Speaker 1: They can't go fast or there's cops.

59
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:23,440
Speaker 0: They would still do it on the occasional empty road, but now they're just doing it everywhere.

60
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:29,515
Speaker 1: Yeah But I wondered is there a thing like is are the drivers who are out now actually worse?

61
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:40,701
Speaker 1: and as I was thinking this I saw An article think it was the Washington Post that was basically like Traffic fatalities are 2x normal despite the fact that traffic is down like 90%.

62
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:47,220
Speaker 1: So despite there being all those no cars on the road in Boston the number of fatalities due to car accidents is skyrocketing.

63
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:56,594
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but no surprise, but the the other thing I saw shortly after that It's a tweet from Steve bowler who's like a really important VR guy like he knows this stuff.

64
00:03:56,614 --> 00:04:18,108
Speaker 1: cool, dude, but uh Yeah, this random tweet where there's this image from Florida from yesterday when a bunch of the social distancing restrictions eased up and There was a gigantic weird car accident immediately, but if you look at the four pictures of this accident There does not appear to be any way.

65
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:26,659
Speaker 1: physics could have caused the accident to appear this way Like there's one car stacked on top of two other cars in a conformance that could only have come from above.

66
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:32,359
Speaker 1: Okay, so the tweet the dude was basically like Lord has done it.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,573
Speaker 1: Lord has created a car accident that cannot be paced back together from the wreckage.

68
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,439
Speaker 1: photos like this makes no sense.

69
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:40,724
Speaker 1: the crazy thing is.

70
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:48,632
Speaker 1: I remember from my childhood witnessing an accident that looked the end result of this looked exactly like this.

71
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:57,537
Speaker 1: and When I was working at IBM seeing in a strip mall in Poughkeepsie an accident that also looked Exactly like this.

72
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:04,360
Speaker 1: It's in like a particular archetype of accident that always has the exact same cause and happens the exact same way.

73
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:05,845
Speaker 1: I went searching around.

74
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:09,900
Speaker 1: I found all those all their images of similar accidents with people being like how the hell could that happen?

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,459
Speaker 1: So I want to briefly before we get into the show explain exactly how this accident happens every time it happens.

76
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,754
Speaker 0: Well, I want to briefly say that it's not an accident.

77
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:19,076
Speaker 0: It is.

78
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:19,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's a collision.

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:27,820
Speaker 1: 99% of all car Incidents are collisions where a human being is specifically there's no such thing as a car accident.

80
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:29,931
Speaker 1: Well, here's an example of a car accident.

81
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:38,259
Speaker 1: due to a cosmic ray The car's computer light crashes and the driver loses control at the exact moment a child was running in front of the car.

82
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:50,539
Speaker 1: Like that could be an accident But otherwise either the child ran out too late and it was technically the child's fault or the person driving More likely was not actually paying attention or was going too fast.

83
00:05:51,901 --> 00:06:01,813
Speaker 1: But anyway this car collision this kind of thing you look at these images if you ever see an act of that thing that looks Like this what usually happens is an older person.

84
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:07,071
Speaker 1: Let's say someone who is not Probably shouldn't be driving anymore is driving.

85
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:08,295
Speaker 0: We shouldn't be driving anymore.

86
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,740
Speaker 1: It's driving on the road.

87
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:14,420
Speaker 1: This accident always happens in a parking lot 99% of the time in a strip mall.

88
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:21,339
Speaker 1: But the person is driving on the regular road has stopped or parked or something and then is about to start again.

89
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:29,929
Speaker 1: Instead of hitting the brake when they expected to they hit the gas while simultaneously Still being in reverse instead of in Drive.

90
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,980
Speaker 1: They then start accelerating rapidly backward.

91
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:42,842
Speaker 1: They then panic because they don't realize that they're holding down the accelerator and they start jamming it down even further and or pumping Because they think it's the brake.

92
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:52,071
Speaker 1: thus continue to accelerate backwards until eventually they either flip the car or More likely run off the road by hitting a curb.

93
00:06:52,412 --> 00:07:00,739
Speaker 1: if you live in suburbia when they hit the curb The car will actually jump at this Angle like you've seen in movies when someone does a stunt where they kind of jump a car.

94
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:08,490
Speaker 1: The car will then go backwards at an angle over the median and land on multiple parked cars in a parking lot in a strip mall.

95
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:17,268
Speaker 1: The fact that I've literally seen this happen once in my life and seen the aftermath of it and sure enough I'm looking at the tweet that I'm linking to.

96
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:34,985
Speaker 1: Someone has already posted security camera footage from a road further away where you clearly see this car Driving backward down the road and then suddenly veering and flipping backward into the strip mall Ta-da, I Really hate that van cars.

97
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:49,096
Speaker 1: Yep All right, you got any news since it's gaming day and we're not talking about What was that game where you just crash blaze burnout something the game we were playing up in Albany What you drive a car and crash it.

98
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,224
Speaker 1: that's basically the whole game burnout.

99
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,749
Speaker 0: it's like a hundred games like that.

100
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,490
Speaker 1: I think it's burnout specifically.

101
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:55,920
Speaker 0: All right.

102
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,967
Speaker 0: I don't know Tons of car games or the or you're supposed to intentionally crash.

103
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:01,630
Speaker 1: No, no burnout.

104
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,930
Speaker 1: We were playing that mode of burnout where the only goal is to set up an elaborate crash.

105
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,008
Speaker 1: There's no other part of the game.

106
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,065
Speaker 0: Okay, there are several games like that.

107
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:09,528
Speaker 0: any name.

108
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,037
Speaker 0: one That isn't burn karmic karmageddon.

109
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:16,183
Speaker 1: karmageddon is a but there's a game beyond.

110
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:18,790
Speaker 1: the crashes are the are part of achieving a greater goal.

111
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,235
Speaker 1: They are not the sole goal.

112
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:22,643
Speaker 0: It's a sub game of Grand Theft Auto.

113
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:23,887
Speaker 1: Yeah burnout.

114
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:24,830
Speaker 1: It's the game.

115
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,599
Speaker 0: Any demolition derby type game?

116
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:28,904
Speaker 1: Ah demolition derby.

117
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:34,366
Speaker 1: The goal is to be the last man standing But I'm talking about video game, oh, yeah, there is a demolition derby video game.

118
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,230
Speaker 1: it's an arcade cabinet.

119
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:38,162
Speaker 1: It's a cocktail cabinet and there's also a stand-up version.

120
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:39,929
Speaker 1: It was that cedar point in the classic arcade.

121
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,123
Speaker 1: I played it every year for much of my life.

122
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:43,270
Speaker 0: So what video game news?

123
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,536
Speaker 0: There's some small video game.

124
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:59,970
Speaker 0: news is that I you know, I guess some of them could be big but I don't want to talk about them too much because The the info is still comes like this supposed to Nintendo leak and a related Mario 64 native builds from leaked source code supposedly.

125
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:01,374
Speaker 0: But I don't know.

126
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:14,005
Speaker 0: we're gonna see what's real and what's not and talk about that in two weeks because that is big if true But still too soon to go into any great depth on that one Without saying something probably.

127
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,977
Speaker 0: Yeah And then you got.

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,822
Speaker 0: you got the biggest deal in gaming right now Is that Valorant game from riot.

129
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:23,410
Speaker 0: who are the people who make League of Legends?

130
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:24,615
Speaker 0: Free to play?

131
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:26,102
Speaker 0: they made a free-to-play FPS.

132
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:30,176
Speaker 0: It's basically like Counter-Strike Counter-Strike Plus.

133
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,783
Speaker 0: it's Counter-Strike Plus overwatch you.

134
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:34,756
Speaker 0: it plays like overwatch But you're trying to plant the bomb.

135
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:38,350
Speaker 1: like counter-strike it plays more like strike and not much like overwatch.

136
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,744
Speaker 1: Most of it is around some Counter-Strike valve.

137
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:41,850
Speaker 0: people worked on it.

138
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like if you watch this gameplay.

139
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:56,601
Speaker 1: It's all about precise head-clicking and recoil patterns of guns as opposed to the ostentatious ridiculous like action quake overwatch Alright, but anyway That's that's a thing people and there's all kinds of related stories around that game.

140
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,630
Speaker 0: because people are fighting for closed beta keys.

141
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:05,328
Speaker 0: You can get big like soon like yeah, well people waited in line to play portal to it.

142
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:14,050
Speaker 0: pexy's true People if you apparently if you're someone who streams it on twitch if you watch their stream it like hands out keys.

143
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:23,893
Speaker 0: So people have been playing Streaming recorded footage on their twitch channels to keep the key fountain flowing basically Stuff like that.

144
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:27,563
Speaker 0: it has some invasive anti-cheat stuff going on.

145
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:30,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, the 10 cent thing that I don't super trust.

146
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all kinds of shenanigans going on with this game.

147
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,728
Speaker 0: It's the biggest game right now.

148
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,485
Speaker 0: I'm not touching it with the 10-foot pole.

149
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,119
Speaker 1: Just you know Don't you like Counter-Strike?

150
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,159
Speaker 0: I?

151
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,254
Speaker 0: Think I don't need to play.

152
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,461
Speaker 0: a different guy can just play Counter-Strike.

153
00:10:43,522 --> 00:10:44,850
Speaker 1: you want to play Counter-Strike this weekend.

154
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,784
Speaker 0: Why not not really have better things to do?

155
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:48,910
Speaker 0: the play counter-strike you kid.

156
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:56,670
Speaker 1: I just I feel like Valorant would and Counter-Strike and Overwatch would all be pretty up your alley, and I don't know why you don't play them.

157
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:58,258
Speaker 0: I got better things to do.

158
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,069
Speaker 1: I play for our train games Yeah, why not?

159
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:08,260
Speaker 1: I'll probably try Valorant, but Overwatch is definitely more my job.

160
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,528
Speaker 0: You install that on your computer.

161
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:09,850
Speaker 0: go ahead.

162
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:13,250
Speaker 1: I mean at this point can't really trust computers anyway.

163
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,830
Speaker 1: If I do if I need to do something I trust I'm gonna bust out one of my old computers.

164
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:17,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll make.

165
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:20,147
Speaker 0: I'll make an SSH keys on my Apple to gs.

166
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:25,230
Speaker 0: watch out Take five hours to make one key, but it'll make it and no one's got that.

167
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,897
Speaker 0: I have to use my RAM.

168
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:33,409
Speaker 0: I'll have to use the entire RAM expansion card to hold the primary the prime numbers in RAM anyway.

169
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:35,956
Speaker 0: So yes, I want to talk about.

170
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:39,410
Speaker 0: actually this is game that came out just recently called the cloudpunk.

171
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:47,137
Speaker 0: I saw this game at PAX East in a booth, and I said oh that looks like a cyberpunk II shadowrun kind of deal.

172
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:53,238
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I saw this too, and I'm looking at the screenshots and So I said alright.

173
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:53,519
Speaker 0: Well.

174
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,524
Speaker 0: You know I'll play.

175
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:55,670
Speaker 0: maybe play that one day.

176
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,272
Speaker 0: I took the.

177
00:11:56,473 --> 00:12:06,018
Speaker 0: I took the card from the booth right and I remembered it and it came out and since Normally, I probably wouldn't have bought it or played it Remembered it or waited for a sale.

178
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:11,209
Speaker 0: Maybe or something, but because we trapped inside what nothing to do Bought that game for 20 bucks.

179
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:18,997
Speaker 0: So my initial impression was oh Man, it's 20 bucks right.

180
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,401
Speaker 0: It's like so.

181
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,629
Speaker 0: I thought I was gonna get a shatter run kind of deal, right?

182
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,643
Speaker 0: But what actually it turned out to be was sort of a walking sim.

183
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,930
Speaker 0: You know that people say walking simulator, right?

184
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,610
Speaker 0: It's actually a walking hovercar simulator.

185
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,054
Speaker 0: Just talk to people Right exactly.

186
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,599
Speaker 0: so you're the.

187
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:53,045
Speaker 0: there's a big map and the map is separated into zones Right and each zone is like a. it's like a cyberpunk neighborhood right with big buildings, and you know holographic Advertisements and all kinds of stuff.

188
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:53,247
Speaker 0: right.

189
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:54,313
Speaker 0: yeah And you're in this.

190
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:58,428
Speaker 0: you're in this hovercar, and you drive it around a very carbon Dallas cab.

191
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:58,770
Speaker 1: feel

192
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:12,599
Speaker 0: Very Blade Runner really right and you know you can drive it all around all you want and if you go to a parking spot The car auto parks you push a and then you get out of the car And you can walk around the area you parked in.

193
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,030
Speaker 0: right and the areas are a little bit mazy, right?

194
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,944
Speaker 0: There's like ramps connecting things cuz you're way up in the sky.

195
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,444
Speaker 0: You're not near the ground right And you can go to different.

196
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:24,378
Speaker 0: You know Can't really go in.

197
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,490
Speaker 0: too many things is mostly talking to people outside.

198
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:31,844
Speaker 0: Right you can buy ramen you can buy drugs you can sell stuff.

199
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:35,260
Speaker 0: you can talk to people You know.

200
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,292
Speaker 0: look walk around look around You can.

201
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,620
Speaker 0: there's like items on the ground you can collect.

202
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:48,365
Speaker 0: right if you walk all the way around and to all the areas You know and the environments are pretty incredible that the you're in.

203
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:52,530
Speaker 0: basically when you're walking around It's not like you've been transported like a lot of games.

204
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,028
Speaker 0: It's like get out of the car, and it transports you into like a separate place.

205
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,025
Speaker 1: So it's always the same world same.

206
00:13:59,166 --> 00:13:59,870
Speaker 0: It's all in the same.

207
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,459
Speaker 0: It's like if you're in the car hovering.

208
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,547
Speaker 0: you can like see the people walking around And then you get out of the car, and there's the same person you just saw man.

209
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:09,174
Speaker 0: You know.

210
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,141
Speaker 0: they just separate it by the different zones.

211
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:18,388
Speaker 0: car wise you have to take the car You know into do like a portal to get the next neighborhood, and then it loads the other zone.

212
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,226
Speaker 0: the whole game Isn't loaded at once right?

213
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:22,534
Speaker 0: But really so.

214
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,650
Speaker 0: as I started to play I was kind of disappointed.

215
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:29,167
Speaker 0: I spent 20 bucks, and it you know it wasn't very shadow runny right?

216
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,274
Speaker 0: you know Shadowrun has some combat.

217
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:37,530
Speaker 0: you know this base had no game at all right in terms of like no nothing skill testing, right?

218
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:45,147
Speaker 0: I mean I guess if you really suck at the driving It would cost you more money because you'd have to go to the gas station a lot And you'd have to repair your car a lot.

219
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,736
Speaker 0: But you it's like I didn't.

220
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:49,283
Speaker 0: there's no dying that I'm aware of.

221
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:53,009
Speaker 0: I don't know what happens if you run out of gas or Destroy the car because that never happened to me.

222
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:55,075
Speaker 0: It's not.

223
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,670
Speaker 0: it's not a difficulty game right.

224
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,150
Speaker 0: It's it's a go from place to place pressing a to get the story to continue game.

225
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:15,748
Speaker 0: And at first I was disappointed in that that it cost 20 bucks, but then as I kept playing my disappointment Disappeared because a this game is long like eight hours.

226
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:19,417
Speaker 0: It took me To get through this whole game right.

227
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:22,124
Speaker 0: It's like it keeps going right to.

228
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:28,201
Speaker 0: the environments are like Crazy like they put so much work into the environments.

229
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:31,070
Speaker 0: the characters the voice acting the art.

230
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:39,270
Speaker 0: It's sort of pixel voxel II But it's the the the little square the cubes that make up the world are sort of like.

231
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:46,585
Speaker 0: Think of it as like small Lego, so it's high-res You know like those mini Legos you get that are like you make it really tiny thing.

232
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a few of those.

233
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:49,515
Speaker 0: It's like that so it.

234
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:53,668
Speaker 0: so the lack of the resolution there doesn't hurt the the atmosphere right.

235
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,925
Speaker 0: It still feels like super cyberpunk like you're in cyberpunk world.

236
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,230
Speaker 0: you can do cyberpunk stuff.

237
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:11,109
Speaker 0: You are free to just sort of go wherever and do whatever right, but nothing really happens unless you either find a side quest or Go to the next mission waypoint.

238
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:18,359
Speaker 0: The game does have some annoyances in it, but they're minor right It does have a little bit of.

239
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,756
Speaker 0: you know collect all the bits from each area But you don't have to do that.

240
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:24,289
Speaker 0: if you don't want to I will gladly not do that.

241
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:35,740
Speaker 0: But really what the game is is it's like oh, I'd like I didn't realize it at first But it's something I wanted That I didn't realize it that it was.

242
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,562
Speaker 0: that's what it was.

243
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,130
Speaker 0: is that it's a JRPG without any random encounters.

244
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,565
Speaker 0: You walk around you talk to people.

245
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:47,398
Speaker 0: you right You get to do fun driving.

246
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:53,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it's like you can't really die You don't have to grind or anything right and it's funny.

247
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:00,030
Speaker 1: That's one thing I like about those Final Fantasy randomizers is you can use them to basically play Final Fantasy without random encounters.

248
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:00,772
Speaker 0: It's not.

249
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:01,575
Speaker 0: there's no encounters.

250
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:22,910
Speaker 0: basically the only skill challenging things in the game that that were there where there were like two or three deliveries that had timers on them and those are very annoying actually because One of them was difficult One where you had to deliver like the still beating heart like before the battery runs out and like 60 seconds or something.

251
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:26,762
Speaker 0: It's like you go to like the the prosthetic company.

252
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:31,038
Speaker 0: They print it out and hand it to you Then you have to get it somewhere in 60 seconds.

253
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:31,520
Speaker 0: It's like that.

254
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,483
Speaker 0: I didn't succeed at that.

255
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,230
Speaker 0: I wonder what happens if you do.

256
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,260
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's like a plot.

257
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:47,826
Speaker 0: the characters are compelling You know there's a and the thing is you know the game gives you some decisions to make plot wise And it usually the way the decisions are made is.

258
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:54,764
Speaker 0: it's like Okay for this delivery drive from here to there And that's all you can do is the game won't progress if you don't drive to the next spot.

259
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:59,499
Speaker 0: right, but sometimes They're like okay You could choose two different spots to drive to.

260
00:17:59,519 --> 00:17:59,780
Speaker 0: you can.

261
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,610
Speaker 0: you can deliver the package or throw it in the garbage right?

262
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:18,487
Speaker 0: choose what to do here and The thing that was pretty good writing wise I think in the game is that all of those Every single time the game gave you some sort of choice to make in those regards including the very end of the game Which is also a choice?

263
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:29,310
Speaker 0: and I think this is also part of the message of the game is every single one of them is There was no clear good bad answer.

264
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,635
Speaker 1: The are you all are there?

265
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:38,127
Speaker 1: are you history's greatest monster, or are you a paragon of virtue right exactly?

266
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:43,820
Speaker 0: and like in Fallout 3 It's like oh kill all the dudes or Convince the dudes right.

267
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,289
Speaker 0: it's like clear good bad.

268
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,890
Speaker 1: Here is a human revolution where it was like do you destroy science or do you destroy?

269
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,001
Speaker 1: Culture or do you kill yourself right?

270
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:53,450
Speaker 0: so I'll give you just one example.

271
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,457
Speaker 0: That's not a spoiler or anything.

272
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:56,020
Speaker 0: there was some.

273
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,750
Speaker 0: there was some Android who you met on a previous mission.

274
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:03,390
Speaker 0: Who's who is like a vacuum cleaner and it was now somehow running a building right right?

275
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:14,202
Speaker 0: And they call you in distress And they want you to pull this switch that will put the building on lockdown because there's some virus spreading in the building All right topical and so you want up.

276
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:16,793
Speaker 0: so you at first you're right assuming They're telling the truth.

277
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:21,610
Speaker 0: you want to sort of lock down the building to help the people who are inside.

278
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,970
Speaker 0: But also this dude is probably lying right.

279
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,736
Speaker 0: So maybe you shouldn't pull the switch.

280
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:41,989
Speaker 0: Maybe you should actually like you know cut power to this dude Right but then maybe the people in the building will be in trouble even though this dude's probably shady Right and up to no good, and you're not sure.

281
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:44,474
Speaker 1: Right all right what?

282
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:47,564
Speaker 0: and you had you got to choose one or the other or leave.

283
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:52,160
Speaker 0: I guess you don't really leave it alone Right cuz it's a side quest so you don't have to.

284
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:52,964
Speaker 0: you could just do nothing.

285
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:53,506
Speaker 0: you can select.

286
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:57,209
Speaker 0: you can just leave those Way points on your mat forever and never touch them.

287
00:19:58,453 --> 00:20:00,007
Speaker 0: But that would be strange if you did that.

288
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:08,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you like cyberpunk atmosphere if you like a JRPG with no combat no grinding no nonsense.

289
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:24,785
Speaker 0: If you got 20 bucks If you like a plot cyberpunk story If you like making decisions if you like walking around collecting stuff Yep, genre tags cyberpunk sci-fi futuristic atmospheric indie.

290
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:30,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, cloudpunk You know great voice acting You know the.

291
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:48,449
Speaker 0: I think the actually the biggest annoyance is that there were a lot of times where you like You'll do a mission you'll get back in the car And then the characters are all talking and you just have to basically sit and wait for all the talking to finish The next waypoint, so it's like there's a lot of sitting and waiting right going on.

292
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:54,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess if there's a story where people will talk to each other and you'll overhear them How do you really avoid that yeah?

293
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,069
Speaker 0: I know you it's usually talking to you or with you.

294
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:10,385
Speaker 0: But yeah You know I don't want to say what a plus But you know if you're trapped inside with $20 all right play it and you got and you have eight hours There's a lot worse you could do.

295
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:19,396
Speaker 1: Meanwhile I pretty much just keep playing overwatch other than all these other like multiplayer games were playing with our own group Not playing a lot of single-player games.

296
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:23,670
Speaker 1: I will be cranking through doom eternal because that's definitely up my alley.

297
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,317
Speaker 0: I played that a couple weeks ago.

298
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll play it so we can review it.

299
00:21:26,944 --> 00:21:27,586
Speaker 1: Maybe the next show.

300
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:35,291
Speaker 1: so Overwatch is making a bunch of tweaks to those hero pools and some of the things they're doing are things that Scott wanted them to Do.

301
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:43,464
Speaker 1: oh interesting they're focusing more on like Ban the characters that are the most used just a force everybody's jimmies to get rustled.

302
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:47,249
Speaker 1: That's right like data-driven But there's a bad.

303
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:48,292
Speaker 1: But they're also.

304
00:21:48,353 --> 00:22:03,865
Speaker 1: it looks like they're gonna remove the hero pools from all the competitive play below a certain level and They made this point about how basically every one of those lower skill tiers They use all the heroes and what they didn't say is because they are terrible at this game.

305
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:05,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

306
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:08,150
Speaker 1: Here's the money shot quote.

307
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:15,610
Speaker 1: Competitive play at lower skill tiers already sees a tremendous amount of hero composition diversity in their matches.

308
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:27,250
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the truth is is that people who aren't people who are good at the game Right are people who are trying to win and someone who's trying to win is going to choose the character on the Pareto frontier.

309
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:37,217
Speaker 0: Someone who doesn't care about being good right is going to choose their favorite character regardless of how good or strong that character is.

310
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:44,879
Speaker 0: and that is why at lower skill levels you will always see a bigger mix because People who suck are right.

311
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:49,078
Speaker 0: if people who are good don't pick shitty characters They'll just pick the strongest one though.

312
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:49,541
Speaker 1: It's fast.

313
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,270
Speaker 0: care if they don't care if they hate that character.

314
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,709
Speaker 0: it's like maybe you know they they're in their life like they're.

315
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:57,037
Speaker 0: They're a big-time metal person.

316
00:22:57,057 --> 00:23:00,190
Speaker 0: They like you know so like they would love to pick the skull dude, right?

317
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,128
Speaker 0: But like if the cute one is the strongest they're like I'll take the cute bear.

318
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,375
Speaker 0: It's the strongest one.

319
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,240
Speaker 0: I'm picking it right.

320
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,049
Speaker 1: I pick Pokemon based solely on looks.

321
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,921
Speaker 0: I Mean me too, but I'm not trying to win Pokemon Right, but you know it's someone who doesn't trying to win.

322
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,410
Speaker 0: It's like I like skull dude.

323
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,902
Speaker 0: I'm picking skull dude no matter what skull dude every time.

324
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,172
Speaker 0: don't care if skull dudes the worst of the best That's my guy.

325
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:23,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

326
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:28,590
Speaker 0: and that person who does that is going to be lower ranked because Right.

327
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:29,835
Speaker 1: yep, though.

328
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:33,330
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that there's still certain heroes that would get rotated out all the time.

329
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:36,513
Speaker 1: It's just this is more fodder for that panel We wanted to do.

330
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:42,655
Speaker 1: we did a draft version of that whole competitive versus casual thing and how they really can't coexist With all these tweaks.

331
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:47,810
Speaker 1: they still can't apply even remotely similar rules to skilled players and unskilled players.

332
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:54,510
Speaker 1: And the worst part is there's still the problem of that like middle third of players who say they're skill based who?

333
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,989
Speaker 1: Who say they're trying to play to win?

334
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,379
Speaker 1: But actually aren't and then get mad.

335
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,650
Speaker 1: if the game if the aim coddles them they get mad.

336
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:04,904
Speaker 1: But if the game shows them that they're actually bad they also get mad.

337
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:06,250
Speaker 1: There's no way to make them happy.

338
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:12,638
Speaker 1: I think that's the group we need to excise from gaming entirely, but like low silver scrubs Well, it's it's.

339
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,890
Speaker 0: you know the problem there.

340
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,517
Speaker 1: I make them only play with each other forever.

341
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:18,470
Speaker 1: you should be a shadow band to the low tier silvers for the rest of your.

342
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,536
Speaker 0: You know what an excise those people right?

343
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:20,817
Speaker 0: It's like.

344
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,785
Speaker 0: There's still people who deserve to play games and have fun.

345
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:23,945
Speaker 0: Well.

346
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:26,940
Speaker 0: They're Want to be better.

347
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:32,682
Speaker 0: they're trying to be better But maybe their talent is low their discipline is low.

348
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,410
Speaker 0: their ability to practice and improve is low.

349
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:40,177
Speaker 0: Their willingness to you know Change themselves.

350
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:41,810
Speaker 1: well, I guess it's a lot of learn.

351
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,957
Speaker 1: I guess there is a fine line.

352
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:50,459
Speaker 1: a lot of people are in those tiers in all games Not just overwatch, but there's that particular tear the to quote that Hanzo thing We talked about a long time ago.

353
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:53,921
Speaker 1: the angriest people in the world I think a good.

354
00:24:53,961 --> 00:25:01,188
Speaker 1: like maybe half of them Maybe even two-thirds rotate in and out of that tear either on the way up or on the way down or are playing kind of Casually don't care that much.

355
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:09,153
Speaker 1: But then there's like that set of people who get increasingly aggrieved and start to become a negative influence on the game and everyone else's Experiences.

356
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:09,897
Speaker 1: there's.

357
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,343
Speaker 0: no I think what you see people.

358
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:21,237
Speaker 0: There's a stereotype You'll see in a lot of like sports movies of the the kid who's has a lot of talent and promise or has some sort Of natural whatever right.

359
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:28,889
Speaker 0: mighty dogs said that then it's all cocky and unresponsive to coaching or advice and isn't a team player right?

360
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,346
Speaker 0: and I think that's what you'll see in those right.

361
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:38,190
Speaker 0: It's like okay They have some natural talent or skill or something that is putting them above the bottom people.

362
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:40,057
Speaker 1: They know how to fly they can.

363
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:47,994
Speaker 0: she can beat up on the bottom people right it's but they're unresponsive to coaching Learning expect.

364
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:51,083
Speaker 0: they think that they're because they're beating up on these people.

365
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,139
Speaker 0: right yeah, they feel like they're good You know.

366
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,150
Speaker 0: and it's like Actually, you're only middle good.

367
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:02,248
Speaker 1: But I guess it's only a problem once they get to the point of being aggrieved and lashing out at other players.

368
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,670
Speaker 0: right.

369
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,926
Speaker 0: well Because if they're only playing against you know You know people worse than them they can beat up on them, and they don't get mad.

370
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:11,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, they feel like yes This is the correct result.

371
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:16,183
Speaker 0: I have one right And then once you find it find someone is actually good.

372
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,830
Speaker 0: It's like hey, right.

373
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:21,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, their belief about their own skill level was inaccurate.

374
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,074
Speaker 1: But I've noticed something.

375
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:30,525
Speaker 0: what I was getting they have they don't have the ability to improve and get better Or the openness or for some reason that's that they've hit their limit right.

376
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:31,448
Speaker 0: so now they're mad.

377
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,780
Speaker 1: so The where I'm going with this is one thing I've observed.

378
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,030
Speaker 1: I've been playing now since the quarantine a lot more overwatch again The community and the way people are interacting with each other in the game and in the voice chat.

379
00:26:42,452 --> 00:27:09,120
Speaker 1: It's just like getting better and better and better as time goes on like everyone's super polite Everyone's chill and I think the main like almost sole reason for that is the hero is not the hero pool necessarily, but the roll lock thing because Consistently no matter what hour of the day I play at any time There is a 10 to 30 minute wait to be a DPS player And there's zero way to be a healer or a tank.

380
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:18,646
Speaker 0: I think that that is partially correct But I think you are not giving enough credit To the number of shitty people who have left overwatch to go play that Valorant game.

381
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:19,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

382
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:22,723
Speaker 1: I didn't want to say that out loud because when I say

383
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:23,266
Speaker 0: I'll say that

384
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:30,130
Speaker 1: out loud when I said I'm gonna play Valorant But what I mean is I want to go play Valorant to see if that's where all the low Silver's are still being

385
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:31,878
Speaker 0: Absolutely all the shit.

386
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,690
Speaker 0: all the people who are bored of overwatch have left to play Valorant.

387
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,035
Speaker 1: Maybe they evolve into.

388
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,842
Speaker 1: well overwatch was bad anyway.

389
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,670
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play a real game with recoil.

390
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:44,744
Speaker 0: If you can't get better at you know the game you're playing right.

391
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:46,330
Speaker 0: you're gonna go switch switch games.

392
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,072
Speaker 0: But that's how it is.

393
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:55,637
Speaker 1: the specific thing that's happening is that because of the hero like the love of the rolox if I play A tank I'm like an upper silver low gold.

394
00:27:55,918 --> 00:28:04,383
Speaker 1: so I play at a rank where the DPS and the healers are also at my Same level meaning the scrubs are basically all gongs.

395
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:06,269
Speaker 1: the scrubs are almost all DPS players anyway.

396
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:21,530
Speaker 1: Meanwhile if I play DPS the Variability of skill is so great that I can pretty much end up dunking on anyone If but I have to wait 10 to 30 minutes to play even a single match in DPS, so I don't bother

397
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:22,852
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

398
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:24,319
Speaker 1: but the fact that the

399
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,770
Speaker 0: it seems like a problem that should be solved also.

400
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're trying to solve the fact that there's a long wait to play DPS.

401
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:34,970
Speaker 1: But the problem the reason there's a long way to play DPS is that a lot of people only want to play DPS.

402
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:35,916
Speaker 0: Why would?

403
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:38,089
Speaker 0: why would you want to play DPS more than the other ones?

404
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,443
Speaker 1: I don't know because DPS is where Reaper like the badass guy with the shotguns is.

405
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:45,810
Speaker 1: it's the like high damage output.

406
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:53,586
Speaker 1: Ostensibly it's the highest skill characters even though in fact I think tanks are more important to the survival of a team, but I digress.

407
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:54,350
Speaker 0: there's line.

408
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:54,751
Speaker 0: I think.

409
00:28:54,872 --> 00:29:01,856
Speaker 0: I think perhaps the problem is that the characters who are DPS are perhaps more fun to play Some to a degree.

410
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:05,370
Speaker 0: but I think I think I think you just have to make it less fun to be DP.

411
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:08,450
Speaker 1: I think all the characters are equally more fun to be the other things.

412
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,870
Speaker 1: They're just fun to play in different ways.

413
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,062
Speaker 1: And I think a lot of players healthily like to play.

414
00:29:13,102 --> 00:29:15,010
Speaker 1: all different kinds of players will rotate from all three.

415
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,585
Speaker 1: Like when I go into queue, I just say put me wherever.

416
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:21,376
Speaker 1: I literally don't care Because I literally don't care for whatever reason.

417
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:29,684
Speaker 1: there's a significant subset of people who seem to be clustered almost entirely In that loose silver tier that want to play DPS.

418
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:33,058
Speaker 1: if you get above that tier You don't have this problem.

419
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,270
Speaker 1: And if you're below that tier you also have this problem.

420
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,113
Speaker 1: It's that tears.

421
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:39,764
Speaker 0: you don't have to wait 30 minutes if you're if you get to a higher rank

422
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:47,784
Speaker 1: exactly or if you're a lower rank It's only if you're in this like one band Where a lot of players are where the majority of the player

423
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,090
Speaker 0: the way you are because you're waiting.

424
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:51,630
Speaker 1: Well, yes, because I've only played a few DPS matches.

425
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:56,806
Speaker 1: Oh because the rank is separate for each thing exactly because the rank is separate for each thing.

426
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:01,583
Speaker 1: if I play gold tank My DPS on my team are gold DPS.

427
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,510
Speaker 1: They've ascended above that fray.

428
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:07,283
Speaker 0: So even if you're not gold DPS, let's say you suck at DPS.

429
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:09,230
Speaker 0: Yep, but you're gold something else.

430
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:12,910
Speaker 1: So good players are rising in ranks in all the roles.

431
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:17,010
Speaker 1: Scrubs only play DPS and are stuck in the scrub tier of DPS.

432
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,330
Speaker 0: Well, and also you might get stuck though not be necessarily because of suckage but because of waiting.

433
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:26,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we can't rank up if you can't play games yep, but people seem to be willing to wait.

434
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,304
Speaker 1: the wait times for DPS are static and That what if they made it?

435
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:42,329
Speaker 0: what if they made it so that you could wait in a in the DPS queue and Also play as another one at the same time so you can play as a tank and then when that game ends You're still in the DPS queue.

436
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:49,964
Speaker 1: They're starting to do something like that where you can play non-competitive games while you're waiting But you can't play competitive games while you're waiting because there's.

437
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:51,310
Speaker 1: no you can't interrupt a competitive game.

438
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:53,083
Speaker 0: no, you don't interrupt it right?

439
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:53,244
Speaker 0: is?

440
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:58,501
Speaker 1: you would have the Okay, basically get credit for time served while you're playing the other match.

441
00:30:59,002 --> 00:30:59,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

442
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:01,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when you come out, right?

443
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,650
Speaker 0: So it's like, okay Let's say somehow while you're in your match you end up number one in the DPS queue.

444
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:08,506
Speaker 0: You would just stay number one.

445
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,927
Speaker 0: Yeah, so your match ends and then once your other match ends you would go into the next game that starts.

446
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:18,433
Speaker 1: Yep, right So yeah I'll link to the article that talks about some of these changes but Waiting.

447
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:22,490
Speaker 1: the long wait for DPS seems to me the primary problem they're trying to solve now.

448
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:23,835
Speaker 0: I think that's.

449
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:27,488
Speaker 0: the solution though is just you can play another real game and just stay in line.

450
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:35,070
Speaker 1: Yep The other solution would be I just got to get my ranking matches out early get to upper silver low gold And then I don't have to worry about this problem.

451
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:37,852
Speaker 1: Alright.

452
00:31:37,872 --> 00:31:39,138
Speaker 1: and last and least I just want to.

453
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:46,518
Speaker 1: there was a scare a little while ago where Everyone on Twitter was losing the shit saying Valve had a source code leak.

454
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,450
Speaker 1: if you play any source games your computer is gonna get hacked.

455
00:31:50,337 --> 00:32:00,377
Speaker 1: That story was such bullshit And I'm so disappointed in so many people who I saw just blindly saying this vulnerability was there and making shit up.

456
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:05,616
Speaker 1: like the amount of shit people made up about that valve leak was ridiculous.

457
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:15,500
Speaker 1: and it's telling that Once the real info like came out and there were no significant hacking incidents No one rejected redacted any of their articles.

458
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,302
Speaker 1: They just went quiet.

459
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,732
Speaker 0: There was definitely not a lot of Fear.

460
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:25,694
Speaker 0: there was a lot of fear when the initial fake story and not much on the you know Comeback story.

461
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:27,361
Speaker 0: So since we did talk about it before.

462
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

463
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:29,330
Speaker 0: Let us let us redact.

464
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,935
Speaker 0: I mean we didn't really say anything.

465
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:32,722
Speaker 0: why we said we're not sure about this.

466
00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:39,177
Speaker 1: There are no known verified RCs as a result of this leak?

467
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,685
Speaker 0: and also what did the truth turn out to be?

468
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:42,408
Speaker 0: do we have a link?

469
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:43,773
Speaker 1: there is Stalling to this?

470
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:47,350
Speaker 1: there is that one valve officially said it is completely safe to play these games.

471
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:54,630
Speaker 1: The source code was old and there are no specific RC vulnerabilities known in that code, which a lot of people are looking at.

472
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:55,753
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

473
00:32:56,297 --> 00:33:05,310
Speaker 1: All right, I mean be lying Yeah, but at the same time a source code leak does not guarantee an RCE In fact, especially when the clients are just interfacing with API's.

474
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:14,729
Speaker 1: knowing the source code of the system behind that API in no way means that you have a way to Remotely execute code on the server that thing's running on.

475
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:28,790
Speaker 0: Well, no but you would you might be able to I find of all I believe the way that the the way that it would supposedly work would Be that you would run say Counter-strike server that was had had you know?

476
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:39,668
Speaker 0: Purposefully installed malware zone and that way anyone who ended up playing on your counter-strike server You could then your your server that you set up is now attacking all your players who you like.

477
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:40,290
Speaker 0: It's like a honey.

478
00:33:40,631 --> 00:33:44,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know which in the old days would be yes come play on my server.

479
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:46,372
Speaker 0: when your game connects to my server I'll get you.

480
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:53,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember quick - there are all these mods and shit that would just download files to your PC to make it Work, that's still kind of the way it works though.

481
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:59,601
Speaker 1: Yeah it is but even then There's no verified remote code execution that anyone pulled off.

482
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:11,389
Speaker 1: nor was there any description of what how one was even plausible Other than vague like people who are smart like us Assuming like well, I guess this is the kind of thing that could happen but no one actually had any evidence at all.

483
00:34:12,732 --> 00:34:24,053
Speaker 0: The way I mean when the original thing came out what I what I had read was That yeah, they saw they looked at the source code and found one that they could do Unverified.

484
00:34:24,092 --> 00:34:25,679
Speaker 1: no one ever verified that claim.

485
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,409
Speaker 0: Well, you know, that's what they said.

486
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:34,440
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm one said and this code is like the source code was so old So it's like how do you know that that's still valve?

487
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:52,021
Speaker 1: also officially pretty quickly said yes This is the leak that happened in 2018. it's the exact same code that was leaked then and Most of this news about it started to move into the story blaming like this one particular Dude for the leak who clearly had nothing to do with it Like it was a. it was a weird situation.

488
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:53,630
Speaker 0: It almost feels like I did read that too.

489
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,164
Speaker 0: There was a dude who was response.

490
00:34:56,205 --> 00:35:02,825
Speaker 0: It was like a valve Like a reporter, right and I guess he was like he had to like deny.

491
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:03,166
Speaker 0: he's like.

492
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:04,410
Speaker 0: no I had nothing to do with this.

493
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,333
Speaker 0: No, it's not me.

494
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:09,848
Speaker 0: No, because I guess he's like the known person for that sort of stuff.

495
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:10,772
Speaker 0: Yes I don't know.

496
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:16,457
Speaker 1: but basically not only does it all seem like it was a big nothing burger But it seemed for whatever reason.

497
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:25,370
Speaker 1: it seems like this was an orchestrated like false news Like someone pushed this narrative and a bunch of people blindly like retweeted it and shared it.

498
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:31,890
Speaker 0: We'll go get your Twitter PI Hat on and find the original, you know spreaders on fortune or whatever.

499
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:35,201
Speaker 1: Yeah I just don't care that much cuz I don't play either of these.

500
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,064
Speaker 1: get like tf2.

501
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:37,529
Speaker 1: I would definitely never play again.

502
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:38,612
Speaker 1: and CS go.

503
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:39,796
Speaker 1: I was playing the other day.

504
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:44,190
Speaker 1: still an okay game, but I feel like Valorant is probably gonna completely eat CS go.

505
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:46,254
Speaker 0: No, I don't know about that.

506
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:52,070
Speaker 1: kids counter-strike has survived everything it has but it is what I was playing at the other day.

507
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:56,370
Speaker 1: The people who are playing counter-strike are quite a community.

508
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:01,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is those were some people that I interacted with.

509
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,362
Speaker 0: good Yeah, like fucking kind of people do you think are playing?

510
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:12,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's uh And I feel like the people who are playing it who are not in the professional scene because the professional scene seems actually pretty fine.

511
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:17,774
Speaker 1: But if you just join like a random CS go match like It's hard to describe.

512
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:19,179
Speaker 1: It's not bad in the ways.

513
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:36,717
Speaker 1: You're expecting me to say it is weird and uncomfortable the interactions that occur on those servers, but anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

514
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:40,050
Speaker 1: So there have been a lot of implementations of pong over the years.

515
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:51,210
Speaker 1: You know pong like the first real video game the game that despite being basically the first video game is still today A fantastic game that could be a fantastic e-sport with zero changes.

516
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,110
Speaker 1: So this video outlines an implementation of pong.

517
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,157
Speaker 1: There's been a lot of implementations of pong over the years.

518
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:07,409
Speaker 1: This implementation is a handheld pong from 1977 that is smaller than a Nintendo switch.

519
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:10,355
Speaker 1: Okay, that's kind of amazing.

520
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:12,100
Speaker 0: What kind of display does it have?

521
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:15,790
Speaker 1: Uh, so that's that's that's uh, that's why this is amazing.

522
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:18,530
Speaker 0: The display would really be the limit to the limiting factors.

523
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:30,630
Speaker 1: so if you look at it as a display has obviously kind of like gay a handheld games from that era has Basically all these physical components all over it Like physical score counter and everything.

524
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:35,890
Speaker 1: But there's a glowing red dot that will bounce back and forth and you can bounce it by hitting the buttons on the left and right.

525
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:44,270
Speaker 1: the sole Electronic component of this game is a tiny battery that lights that LED.

526
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:47,481
Speaker 1: Everything else is not electro mechanical.

527
00:37:47,762 --> 00:37:49,310
Speaker 1: It is purely mechanical.

528
00:37:50,611 --> 00:38:02,645
Speaker 1: You wind the game up and which winds up a spring and then when you play the game You move the paddles by hitting buttons on the two sides that physically move components that you can't see.

529
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:14,578
Speaker 1: and there's this complicated arm mechanism that will that has an LED on the end of it and it'll just trace the ball back and forth based on where you Pushed the buttons and what it bounced off of.

530
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,847
Speaker 1: the entire game is 100% mechanical.

531
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:20,379
Speaker 1: There's just a tiny battery powering a single LED.

532
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,587
Speaker 1: There's no other electronic component at all.

533
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:28,221
Speaker 1: This is Barely ingenious to make a portable pong in 19.

534
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:29,644
Speaker 0: How well does it work though?

535
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:30,787
Speaker 1: It works perfectly.

536
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:39,956
Speaker 1: It's just not a great game Because the paddles could only be in three different three positions on each side Mmm, but it works.

537
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:41,541
Speaker 1: it is technically like.

538
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:42,804
Speaker 1: it's an implementation of pong.

539
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:44,830
Speaker 1: how its implemented is pretty fascinating.

540
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:57,010
Speaker 1: it's a. it's a case study in how to build a game with the tools that you got and how to be clever and creative in light of Extremely challenging technical and material science considerations.

541
00:38:57,612 --> 00:39:02,890
Speaker 0: I mean if you think about it right at the same time that there was NES there was also tiger LCD, right?

542
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:06,057
Speaker 1: I remembered we're not like they were.

543
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:06,398
Speaker 1: they were.

544
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,824
Speaker 1: they were worth negative amounts of money.

545
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:09,927
Speaker 1: those tiger LCDs.

546
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,270
Speaker 1: those things were garbage.

547
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:14,640
Speaker 0: They weren't garbage until the gameboy arrived.

548
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,689
Speaker 1: I would argue they were worse than nothing before the gameboy came out.

549
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:20,287
Speaker 0: No, the gameboy is what killed tiger LCD.

550
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:25,887
Speaker 1: anyway I think the only people who like tiger LCD were the people who had them and didn't want to admit that they were literally unplayable garbage.

551
00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:27,889
Speaker 0: Some of them were better than others.

552
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:29,914
Speaker 1: Yes, that is true.

553
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:31,419
Speaker 1: that is technically true.

554
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,970
Speaker 0: in this actually I think there's an Aladdin one that was like actually quite good.

555
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:40,850
Speaker 1: I would argue that Those equivalent games that just had ball bearings in them were better.

556
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:44,063
Speaker 1: The worst ball bearing game was better than the best tiger LCD game.

557
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,067
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

558
00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:48,442
Speaker 1: fight me Let's do a show on those ball bearings games.

559
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:50,130
Speaker 0: Let's do a show on tiger LCD game.

560
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,094
Speaker 1: Let's do a show on both.

561
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:54,810
Speaker 1: We can probably get a pile of both of them on eBay for like zero dollars.

562
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:56,480
Speaker 0: I could just get the ones I have it.

563
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,566
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're still there.

564
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:58,452
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I don't know.

565
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:01,350
Speaker 1: I don't know if I actually my mom might still have all those ball bearing games.

566
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,860
Speaker 0: Tiger LCD games may or may not be in Connecticut.

567
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:06,990
Speaker 1: that that's two geek nights episodes.

568
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,878
Speaker 0: Anyway, we might have done a tiger LCD episode.

569
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:10,722
Speaker 1: We might have.

570
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:12,308
Speaker 1: so do you got?

571
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:12,870
Speaker 0: what do I have?

572
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,685
Speaker 0: So, you know, we love industrial accidents here our geek nights.

573
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:21,190
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, like you We don't like it when people get hurt, but we like YouTube videos of large large things breaking.

574
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:24,310
Speaker 0: So, I don't know who got hurt here.

575
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:27,697
Speaker 0: I'm sorry, if anyone did get hurt.

576
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:35,241
Speaker 0: I'm not aware of what damages there were to people But this collapse of a crane is too impressive.

577
00:40:35,322 --> 00:40:37,087
Speaker 0: So here's the situation.

578
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,880
Speaker 0: is you have this Floating boat right a floating boat.

579
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,689
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there are not floating boats like summer.

580
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:49,510
Speaker 0: sure It's a boat with a crane on it and the purpose of the boat with the crane on it is to build offshore wind farms.

581
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:59,370
Speaker 0: So the crane, you know next to it is a barge and on the barge are pieces of the you know, the wind You know, whatever you call it turbine, right?

582
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,830
Speaker 0: Yeah So the crane the crane boat is gonna lift the things off the barge.

583
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:08,190
Speaker 0: The barge moves out of the way and then they use the crane and whatever to erect the giant.

584
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, so good news before you continue base.

585
00:41:10,898 --> 00:41:15,110
Speaker 1: I dug her on the YouTube comments, which one are extremely accurate and like fascinating.

586
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,795
Speaker 1: I'm actually gonna read also racist.

587
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:18,580
Speaker 1: I have not run into that yet.

588
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:21,770
Speaker 0: There are a lot of them complaining like a Chinese steel.

589
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:25,779
Speaker 1: I've not seen any comment that says anything.

590
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:35,833
Speaker 0: like when I read the comments half of them were like racist construction workers being like that Chinese steel and then people were applying like it's German steel mine sorted by top comments not Chronological.

591
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:36,637
Speaker 1: maybe that's the difference.

592
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:37,623
Speaker 0: I don't know.

593
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,010
Speaker 0: I haven't read the comment anyway.

594
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:44,132
Speaker 1: This was a load test of the crane Correct.

595
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:48,306
Speaker 0: they were testing the crane to see how good it was and it wasn't good enough.

596
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,233
Speaker 0: Yeah You can read.

597
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:50,775
Speaker 0: I don't want to.

598
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:55,510
Speaker 0: I don't want to describe what the exact breakage was because I am NOT a crane expert.

599
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:58,198
Speaker 1: Looks like the hook block failed under load.

600
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,081
Speaker 0: Yes.

601
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:02,130
Speaker 0: So there's like a from what you can see in the video, right?

602
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,381
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's a behind the crane, right?

603
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:06,405
Speaker 0: So it's your look.

604
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:07,770
Speaker 0: you're looking at the back of the crane.

605
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:10,661
Speaker 0: It's lifting something on the other side of the boat, right.

606
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:21,959
Speaker 0: so deeper into the video than you can see Is the thing it's lifting and you know all the cables that are you know, going up to the top of the crane are tied down Behind the crane.

607
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,494
Speaker 0: you can see like these little triangles Right behind the.

608
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:26,517
Speaker 0: you see them there.

609
00:42:26,557 --> 00:42:31,605
Speaker 0: They're like little and there's a thing that's tied down there and I guess it comes loose I think.

610
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:34,439
Speaker 0: Read the comments for expert opinion.

611
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,750
Speaker 0: Don't trust my opinion on what went wrong.

612
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:42,875
Speaker 1: I love when an expert just rolls in somewhere and it's just like looks like the entire hook block broke during a hundred ten percent SWL load.

613
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:45,596
Speaker 1: yes You can see what's on that left yellow block.

614
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:54,443
Speaker 1: this sort of released all the tension in the boom suddenly making it crash back into the a-frame Probably a casting or forging error Something like that.

615
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:57,337
Speaker 0: So sure Yeah, you can just watch this video though.

616
00:42:57,357 --> 00:43:00,690
Speaker 0: It's 23 seconds long and not a waste of 23 seconds of your life.

617
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:08,290
Speaker 1: I like how it like the droop is actually kind of funny like it's comedic the like slow way that it droops.

618
00:43:09,197 --> 00:43:20,821
Speaker 1: Yep, that's why it's a good video Yep, but also in general one thing you can bear in mind whenever you find videos that are about industrial tests that fail those very rarely have any injuries or deaths because it's still.

619
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:30,350
Speaker 0: it's still a shame that this is even though this is a test that Is still a very expensive thing that took a long time to make and was many many millions of dollars probably in damages.

620
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,414
Speaker 1: So fun fact.

621
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:32,557
Speaker 1: because I'm into elevators.

622
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,350
Speaker 1: Did you know that all elevators get multiple levels of failure testing?

623
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:41,910
Speaker 1: Including a test that they basically the final test that elevators get on.

624
00:43:42,773 --> 00:43:45,224
Speaker 1: They do this on a varying basis depending where you are in the world.

625
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:49,380
Speaker 1: laws are different everywhere But there's all these different mechanisms that prevent elevators from falling.

626
00:43:49,821 --> 00:44:00,966
Speaker 1: the final tests for certifying elevators involves literally removing Every single one of those fail backs every safety mechanism every electrical control.

627
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:14,230
Speaker 1: Everything is removed Except the final one like the last ditch one and then They basically run a drop test to see if the elevator will have a problem and if there's a problem in anything in the elevator.

628
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:23,599
Speaker 1: the video of what happens is terrifying and Elevators fail that test kind of often Relative to how often you'd expect them to fail that test.

629
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,550
Speaker 0: Why didn't you put your knowing that test skin is gonna happen?

630
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,310
Speaker 0: Wouldn't you put your most effort into that final safety?

631
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:34,690
Speaker 1: That's but the fact that an elevator can't really go live until even that test has happened.

632
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:37,830
Speaker 1: That is why people don't die when elevators fall.

633
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:39,309
Speaker 0: That's true.

634
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:47,261
Speaker 1: but basically the video if you ever see one of those tests fail is you're in the top of the elevator where like all the Machinery is and suddenly that's so.

635
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,025
Speaker 0: that's where you want to be.

636
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:57,529
Speaker 1: You don't want to be at the bottom Yeah, and you basically just see like everything go crazy and cables start like flailing everywhere and you see the cables go All the way down to the bottom.

637
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:01,137
Speaker 1: Yep All right in the meta moment.

638
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:01,981
Speaker 1: We're hanging out.

639
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:04,190
Speaker 1: Not a lot we can do can't go to any cons.

640
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:15,836
Speaker 1: Not the earliest con we would even consider Possibly going to depending on situations would be in September with PAX West and even that anyone knows any online Cons that want to have us.

641
00:45:16,198 --> 00:45:19,460
Speaker 1: let us know We will bring our panels.

642
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:20,750
Speaker 1: we can stream them live.

643
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:29,730
Speaker 1: Yep, as soon as we can meet in person safely We'll probably start just videoing live panels and just doing them for the internet.

644
00:45:30,652 --> 00:45:32,160
Speaker 0: Who knows I feel like we'll do that.

645
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,790
Speaker 0: say who can say what we'll do.

646
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,159
Speaker 1: I mean, I plan to do that.

647
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:35,702
Speaker 1: We're playing do that.

648
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:39,332
Speaker 1: Anyway, the problem is right now We can't even really like meet in person Mm-hmm.

649
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:43,705
Speaker 1: I guess we could do the panel six feet apart in a park somewhere.

650
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,390
Speaker 0: Am I gonna get you sacred?

651
00:45:47,132 --> 00:45:48,818
Speaker 0: You Got you got something you want to tell me.

652
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:50,529
Speaker 1: Hey, you never know you never know.

653
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:54,170
Speaker 1: We'll see how things go, but we're not going to any cons anytime soon.

654
00:45:54,330 --> 00:46:00,050
Speaker 1: So if you're hoping to see us at like Connecticut or anything that have thank icon anything that was essentially gonna.

655
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, whether the con is can announced its cancellation or not.

656
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:04,023
Speaker 0: We're not gonna be there.

657
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,390
Speaker 0: There is currently no con on our schedule.

658
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:08,341
Speaker 0: That is confirmed.

659
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:08,604
Speaker 1: Yep.

660
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:17,675
Speaker 1: The earliest Possibility is PAX West not saying that that will happen or that we will be the low percent chance Earliest possible chance.

661
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:26,430
Speaker 0: we will be at any convention for the foreseeable book club book is tale of Genji But I don't even know if I'm gonna get to go to a beach to read it once it starts getting a little warmer.

662
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,099
Speaker 1: I might just start reading in the park like when I'm out biking.

663
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,587
Speaker 0: So yes, something like that could definitely happen.

664
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:35,557
Speaker 0: Yeah What else is meta you should?

665
00:46:35,617 --> 00:46:38,666
Speaker 0: we're working on a code of conduct.

666
00:46:38,706 --> 00:46:51,214
Speaker 0: still you should come To our forum and this code of conduct it implies to you because it is not just for our forum Which you should join it implies to all geek nights Community spaces.

667
00:46:51,595 --> 00:47:06,330
Speaker 0: so like if we have a game night if we have a meetup at a convention if we any Absolutely any geek nights community space these rules will apply And you will be expected to abide by them if you wish to participate in any of those spaces.

668
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:11,997
Speaker 0: So if you're happy just listening to geek nights and never interacting with our community Then it doesn't concern you.

669
00:47:12,057 --> 00:47:25,400
Speaker 0: but but if you want to be a part of our community Like we'll block you from everything if you want to be a part of our community Even if we just want to tweet with us on Twitter You know also you should speaking of our community.

670
00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:27,386
Speaker 0: You should come to our discord.

671
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:30,196
Speaker 0: I have people have been Doing stuff in there.

672
00:47:30,236 --> 00:47:45,910
Speaker 0: They've been streaming games to and with each other the listeners getting together Often so you could get in there with them and abide by the guidelines that are not yet set in stone But we are seeking your input to finalize them, and they won't ever truly be finalized.

673
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:54,404
Speaker 0: They will just merely be revised enough to go live and then continue to be revised From here until eternity because you never know what will happen.

674
00:47:54,424 --> 00:48:01,869
Speaker 0: There'll be some new form of Discrimination against cyborg people that we will have to you know put a rules against or something right.

675
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:07,070
Speaker 1: yeah At least until we eventually replace all humans with cyborgs and then transcend into a new trans human.

676
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,844
Speaker 0: Go ahead the code of conduct is on github And there is also a thread on the forum so you can.

677
00:48:11,884 --> 00:48:19,367
Speaker 0: you can come and give your feedback About it to us in any way that you feel comfortable doing so including anonymously.

678
00:48:19,568 --> 00:48:20,390
Speaker 0: or what have you yeah?

679
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:28,667
Speaker 1: I only had to ban one person whose feedback Against the code of com of code of conduct was itself a violation of the code of conduct as written.

680
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:29,570
Speaker 0: yeah, right.

681
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:36,830
Speaker 0: well Even though this particular code of conduct is not yet live right we still have basic rules that are always in place, right?

682
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,274
Speaker 1: I mean like if you're not it's not like.

683
00:48:38,635 --> 00:48:43,410
Speaker 0: our communities are not an unsafe place because we haven't put these rules in yet.

684
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,100
Speaker 0: We're just codifying sort of what the existing spirit is.

685
00:48:47,481 --> 00:48:49,085
Speaker 0: at least that's the goal right.

686
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:50,990
Speaker 1: yep, so yeah, let's get into it.

687
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,913
Speaker 1: We played another train game.

688
00:48:51,933 --> 00:49:04,570
Speaker 1: We played the strain game many times, but now that I've played it multiple times in a row Not at a convention with no time pressure I have a lot more deep insight into it and a lot more thoughts about the 18xx genre as a whole.

689
00:49:05,254 --> 00:49:13,290
Speaker 0: Right there is still so many 18xx games We haven't played and there is so much more for us to learn which is why I keep playing them despite having many criticisms.

690
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:19,148
Speaker 0: But yeah, 18 is 1846 which is the one we first played and did a show on.

691
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:25,010
Speaker 0: yep This is the second one I played actually which is 1889 which is history of Shikoku railways.

692
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:41,550
Speaker 0: So Shikoku is this island in Japan that I yeah that I always remember because I was watching an anime and there was a joke in the anime about an old lady who couldn't hear and Someone and they asked the old lady asked someone where they were from and they said Shikoku.

693
00:49:42,832 --> 00:49:54,885
Speaker 0: Or no, I think they someone said G Goku which is the Japanese Right and the old lady was like oh you're from Shikoku Because they sound Shikoku is a Japanese an island of Japan.

694
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:59,770
Speaker 0: that is Shikoku literally translates to four districts.

695
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:04,870
Speaker 0: So it has four districts right sort of north south east and west and it's sort of cut in half by these mountain range.

696
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:07,765
Speaker 0: You can just look at it on a map and you'll see what I'm talking about.

697
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:08,830
Speaker 0: You'll be like, oh that place.

698
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,198
Speaker 0: I know that I've seen it on maps of Japan before.

699
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:12,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's Shikoku.

700
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:14,890
Speaker 0: So this game is about.

701
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:27,216
Speaker 0: Shikoku was mostly served transportation wise by ferries And then in the 1800s, obviously like Oh around 1889 or so began to be served.

702
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:36,290
Speaker 0: it began to be served by trains and That would take you between the places on Shikoku and this game is an evil game of capitalism.

703
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:40,484
Speaker 0: About that takes place on that geography in that time period.

704
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:45,030
Speaker 1: All right, so 18 xx games we're not gonna get into the whole story.

705
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:48,410
Speaker 1: You can listen to our 1846 episode which was our introduction to the genre.

706
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:50,344
Speaker 1: But they're train games.

707
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:59,605
Speaker 0: They're like archetypical train games when you think about Right when you think about oh those old guys at the game store playing train games.

708
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,910
Speaker 0: This is that game.

709
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,054
Speaker 0: This is what it is.

710
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,104
Speaker 0: Right the myth of mystery has been revealed.

711
00:51:05,144 --> 00:51:06,850
Speaker 0: It's not some mysterious place anymore.

712
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:19,650
Speaker 0: This is how the game is and the fundamental thing about all these train games and the thing that draws me to them all Regardless of the details or problems is the fundamental mechanic of the meta game being the real game?

713
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

714
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:23,765
Speaker 0: You would look at this game or any of these games and say aha.

715
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:26,159
Speaker 0: There's this map There's these trains.

716
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:37,690
Speaker 0: you're trying to run trains To get the longest to get long routes that are worth a lot of points and that you would be thinking is that is the real Game, but no that game you're thinking of is Raro tycoon, right?

717
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,077
Speaker 0: Raro tycoon is the game.

718
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to run the trains and get the most money.

719
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:49,410
Speaker 1: This game is more about extracting wealth from the system into your own personal coffers while fucking over other players with a spreadsheet.

720
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:54,535
Speaker 0: right, so take Raro tycoon and No longer are you.

721
00:51:54,675 --> 00:51:56,261
Speaker 0: is each player a train company?

722
00:51:56,763 --> 00:52:02,921
Speaker 0: You are now instead a stock Investor wealthy person right tycoon and literal tycoon.

723
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:10,570
Speaker 0: the players of the Raro tycoon are actually these Abstract company objects and you buy and sell shares in them.

724
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,827
Speaker 0: You might at one point be the president of one in which case you will decide what it does.

725
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:15,450
Speaker 0: on its turn.

726
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:21,492
Speaker 1: You might be the president of two or three or or or all or none And you are.

727
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:32,190
Speaker 0: you know, you see you might take the turn of a company once in a while here and there But you're simply just trying to not make one company better or worse necessarily.

728
00:52:32,672 --> 00:52:38,330
Speaker 0: You are simply trying to take the most money out of the system and into your pocket.

729
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:40,449
Speaker 1: Yep, your money is not the company's money.

730
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,510
Speaker 0: You want to own shares in the valuable companies?

731
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:44,813
Speaker 0: You want to.

732
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:49,348
Speaker 0: when trains are required to be purchased you want someone else to have to purchase them?

733
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:56,030
Speaker 0: And then you want to get the revenues for when those trains run and passengers pay to get on them, right?

734
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:02,142
Speaker 0: When tracks have to be laid through the mountains you want someone else to dig the tunnel and you want to run your train through it.

735
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:08,010
Speaker 0: Or better yet You want them to dig the tunnel and then put a blocking token so that they can't run their train?

736
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, only you can.

737
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:13,080
Speaker 0: this is the kind of game this is And they're all.

738
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:13,709
Speaker 1: what makes eight?

739
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:19,490
Speaker 1: Yeah All these 18xx games are basically that same fundamental theme but with crook like rules are crook slightly.

740
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:27,026
Speaker 1: So like in some games the companies if they like someone buys enough stock to start one They start with all the money that they could have started with from the bag.

741
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:28,553
Speaker 1: in other games Players put it in right?

742
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,641
Speaker 1: So what makes 1889 different from the other ones, right?

743
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,450
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not gonna go into all the details of everything that makes it different because I don't know them all.

744
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:39,619
Speaker 1: Yep, we're gonna focus more like how it feels like.

745
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:42,230
Speaker 1: why how does it feel different to play right?

746
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:54,789
Speaker 0: 1889 is mostly from what I've heard based a lot on 1830 which I think is the original 18xx game with a few minor Changes and obviously the map is different and the trains are a little different, right?

747
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:58,702
Speaker 0: But the first big difference is that you know, what does it?

748
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:01,390
Speaker 0: this is concept of a company floating, right?

749
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:08,073
Speaker 0: So it's you know, every company starts with no one owning any shares and you start buying shares Right.

750
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:19,349
Speaker 0: and and you when you when enough shares of a company have been bought regardless of who bought them the company comes into existence and can start playing the game and The company has its own money, which is separate from players money.

751
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:25,472
Speaker 0: So in 1846, which we did an episode on long ago, which I'll link to Right.

752
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:41,370
Speaker 0: The way it works is that you buy IPO shares and I forget how many you have to buy to make the company float but it's some number and then the company will have money equal to The money spent on those IPO shares sort of like the real world, right?

753
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:47,229
Speaker 0: Like if I buy an IPO share for $100 the company now has $100 to invest in it that it can use right?

754
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,449
Speaker 0: But then you know after the company floats there are still IPO shares sitting there.

755
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:57,425
Speaker 0: And if you were to say buy one in 1846 that would put more money into the company.

756
00:54:57,726 --> 00:55:01,291
Speaker 0: right when you bought more shares in 1889.

757
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:04,810
Speaker 0: Let's say a company opens at seventy dollars, right?

758
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:08,992
Speaker 1: So you're sending the initial share price at seventy dollars a share Right.

759
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:10,618
Speaker 0: So and I buy five of the shares.

760
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:14,010
Speaker 0: so three hundred and fifty dollars is spent on buying shares.

761
00:55:14,332 --> 00:55:18,901
Speaker 0: The other five shares are still there Available to be purchased at seventy dollars each.

762
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:26,855
Speaker 0: the IPO shares the five That I did not buy that someone else could buy later or I can buy or whatever the company immediately.

763
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:34,777
Speaker 0: as soon as it floats the company will immediately go open and it will have $700 in its coffers.

764
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:39,730
Speaker 0: right buying those additional IPO shares will not put money into the company.

765
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:49,830
Speaker 0: the company starts with its full amount of money from all the shares even though only five have been purchased and When those remaining five are purchased that money just goes to the bank, right?

766
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,124
Speaker 0: and what this means is that you can sort of get you get this mechanic happening.

767
00:55:55,164 --> 00:55:56,166
Speaker 0: that doesn't happen in 1846 so much.

768
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,609
Speaker 0: where You want to just float a company?

769
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:07,733
Speaker 0: suddenly all that money you spent is doubled but it's in a company and you want to yank that money out of that company and Into your wallet.

770
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:09,884
Speaker 1: You can't just embezzle it directly.

771
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:25,378
Speaker 1: You can't just steal it Can't do that like you need the company to buy a smaller company that you own personally from you at an exorbitant rate or you need to invest in a second company and then Basically have that company.

772
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,225
Speaker 1: once you trick some other morons into investing into that company with you You have your original company.

773
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:38,069
Speaker 1: buy Something from that company for like a dollar like buy all the company's trains and then sell all that company shares and fuck it.

774
00:56:38,883 --> 00:56:50,190
Speaker 0: Yep Things like that happen Exactly, and the main thing in this the main rule in this game is that if a company has no trains It must buy a train at the end of its turn, right?

775
00:56:50,990 --> 00:57:00,186
Speaker 0: And if a company does not have enough money in its coffers to buy a train The president of that company must contribute to buy the cheapest train available.

776
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:08,112
Speaker 1: So from their wallet On top of that different trains like you can only buy trains in sequence and there's like a level 2 a level 3 a level 4 Train.

777
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:16,710
Speaker 1: once you buy certain trains of certain levels all the trains of certain earlier levels Just instantly disappear and are gone forever and worth nothing, right?

778
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:17,493
Speaker 0: So the game starts.

779
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,983
Speaker 0: only the two trains are available the weakest train.

780
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,730
Speaker 0: they can only go to two spots, right?

781
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,459
Speaker 0: So they don't collect a lot of money.

782
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:25,370
Speaker 0: They just go from point A to point B like a shuttle.

783
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:29,710
Speaker 0: And so let's say a company loads up on two trains.

784
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:34,628
Speaker 0: Well, as soon as I think a four train is bought those two trains will all disappear from the game.

785
00:57:34,848 --> 00:57:44,190
Speaker 0: Yep So if a company is full of two trains and it doesn't have enough money Then as soon as someone else buys a four train that company has no trains and has to buy one.

786
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:49,730
Speaker 0: So that the trick you want to do would would be be the owner of the company with the two trains.

787
00:57:50,652 --> 00:57:51,999
Speaker 0: It suddenly doubles money.

788
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:55,494
Speaker 0: There's a big fountain of money in that company Because it just it floated.

789
00:57:56,196 --> 00:58:04,310
Speaker 0: you want to use all the money from that company to buy trains From this other company that you started your second company.

790
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:10,720
Speaker 0: so you moved all the money from company a that has the shit trains to Company B, which has the good trains.

791
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:15,709
Speaker 0: Oh, right and then company a loses all its trains.

792
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:28,154
Speaker 0: But luckily by the time that happens you sold your shares in that shitty company I know someone else is the president and now they are forced to Purchase a train with the money from their wallet.

793
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:29,279
Speaker 0: and now you're ahead.

794
00:58:29,811 --> 00:58:33,432
Speaker 0: Yes Your wallet is full of money that you didn't spend on trains.

795
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:39,917
Speaker 1: you spent some company money on trains And then you can use that money to buy more stocks and rinse and repeat and everyone's right.

796
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:40,720
Speaker 0: and now that right?

797
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,839
Speaker 0: How can that person now who just lost all the money in their wallet buying trains by you know out of pocket?

798
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,537
Speaker 0: Invest in stocks right there their funds are depleted.

799
00:58:50,979 --> 00:58:55,289
Speaker 1: Yeah You get the stock out of this game pretty easily if they're not careful.

800
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:59,936
Speaker 1: and The game is always tense as soon as anyone has two companies.

801
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:00,819
Speaker 1: They could.

802
00:59:01,665 --> 00:59:04,884
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways they could screw everybody else over Right.

803
00:59:04,944 --> 00:59:12,485
Speaker 0: So I think the major the major things going on in this game is that the turn order Matters too much.

804
00:59:12,826 --> 00:59:14,711
Speaker 1: that is probably like what one thing.

805
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:19,879
Speaker 0: this is true of I think all the 18xx games But it's especially true of this one.

806
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's sort of this interesting fatal flaw and why we want to talk about this game.

807
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:24,838
Speaker 1: because I enjoy 18xx games.

808
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:27,852
Speaker 1: I enjoyed this one more than the other ones.

809
00:59:27,872 --> 00:59:29,400
Speaker 1: like this is I think my favorite.

810
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:31,918
Speaker 0: Oh, I enjoy it, but but I still have problems with it.

811
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:35,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what we're realizing is that there are specific

812
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:36,869
Speaker 0: mechanics

813
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:49,999
Speaker 1: in these games that we like but there are other mechanics in these games that either obscure the reality of those mechanics or are kind of broken or Arbitrary or limit how much you can engage with the fun parts of the game.

814
00:59:50,642 --> 01:00:01,940
Speaker 0: So I felt like you would think that like choosing the right stocks to buy like figuring out their values into the future Would be like a really good heuristic that you would want in this game.

815
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:08,431
Speaker 0: It would only help if everyone playing the game had never played 1889 before sure But that only helps you a little bit.

816
01:00:08,712 --> 01:00:10,100
Speaker 0: that helps you like a tiny amount.

817
01:00:10,142 --> 01:00:14,898
Speaker 1: Yeah When we were playing our game before All four of us knew which stock was the hot stock.

818
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:18,660
Speaker 1: at all times No one disagreed about the value of anything at any point, right?

819
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:23,312
Speaker 0: It's like it was pretty much obvious Like if you have money to buy a stock and you're gonna buy one which one to buy?

820
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:23,734
Speaker 0: there wasn't.

821
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:27,828
Speaker 0: it wasn't a hard decision And it didn't change the course of the game.

822
01:00:27,949 --> 01:00:33,749
Speaker 0: that significantly what changes the course of the game significantly is like well I'm going third therefore blah.

823
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:36,619
Speaker 0: Yeah layer or that was much more important.

824
01:00:38,024 --> 01:00:38,726
Speaker 0: Who was gonna win?

825
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:40,091
Speaker 1: this is my real problem.

826
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:48,300
Speaker 1: like the the deep flaw of all 18xx games Is that the basic game like operating the trains like there's not much there, which is fine.

827
01:00:48,762 --> 01:01:00,924
Speaker 1: the stock rounds are the real game, but the stock rounds can be extremely massively disrupted by specific things that can happen in those otherwise unimportant Operating rounds.

828
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:04,200
Speaker 1: like someone buys the next train that rusts a bunch of trains.

829
01:01:04,504 --> 01:01:05,680
Speaker 1: Now the whole game state is broken.

830
01:01:06,182 --> 01:01:11,140
Speaker 0: But well because it's not just the turn order of this of the that you have in the stock round.

831
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:18,220
Speaker 0: there's a separate turn order of Which order the companies will take their turn in the company round?

832
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can't manipulate the turn order of the stock round during the operating round.

833
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:26,000
Speaker 0: But you can write the stock round is determined.

834
01:01:26,168 --> 01:01:43,640
Speaker 0: basically there's an order that's set randomly at the start of the game and there's a first player marker and Basically whoever takes the last stock action buying or sell and or selling and then everyone passes The next person after the person who took the last action, so let's say I buy a stock everyone else passes.

835
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,282
Speaker 0: Then I pass.

836
01:01:44,323 --> 01:01:47,173
Speaker 0: yeah, whoever is to my left is gonna now go first.

837
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:48,980
Speaker 0: the order is always the same.

838
01:01:49,061 --> 01:01:59,662
Speaker 1: It's like clockwise around the table And that's the fundamental thing that I feel is holding these games back from being great Generally as opposed to being great in this extremely narrow niche Right.

839
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:04,439
Speaker 0: The second thing is so the order that the companies operate is from most valuable to least valuable.

840
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,489
Speaker 1: Yeah There's this whole complicated market.

841
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:07,474
Speaker 1: Listen to our 1846 episode.

842
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:09,644
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that.

843
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:17,240
Speaker 0: because because companies can only buy trains on their turn They can't at the end of their turn also, they can't sell trains, right?

844
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:43,020
Speaker 0: so if you want if you have two companies and you want company a to sort of take trains away from company B and Company B to then buy a good train with all of the money that it has now and then get rid of company a You need to make sure that company a that's gonna do the buying Right to pull the shitty trains into itself has to be more valuable than company B so that it goes first.

845
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:53,576
Speaker 1: Yep But at the same time you also have to make sure that other companies that could buy a train in the wrong order Don't exist and operate before you and fuck it up, right?

846
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:54,760
Speaker 0: It's like I want to buy a for train.

847
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,279
Speaker 0: Well, there's only a few of those in the game.

848
01:02:56,681 --> 01:03:01,800
Speaker 0: If too many other players go before you they'll buy all the for trains up before it's your turn.

849
01:03:01,922 --> 01:03:11,300
Speaker 1: but if too many You might buy the for train and then other people can execute their plans and move right into the sixes and you get rusted And one of your companies and it's your bankrupt, right?

850
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:18,119
Speaker 0: So that turn order just matters so much and you can pay attention to it and manipulate it which is a skill, right?

851
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:26,246
Speaker 1: but you have very few levers with which to manipulate it and you're very much at the mercy of the other players and Physical turn order.

852
01:03:26,828 --> 01:03:34,280
Speaker 0: Yes, you do have few levers with which to manipulate it But you can see it so you can at least avoid falling into its trap, right?

853
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:41,580
Speaker 0: If you're watching it closely, but the biggest problem is that it's just disappointing not to say that that's a bad game.

854
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:47,100
Speaker 0: It's just like you come to the train game wanting to do train stuff and it's like you're not doing train stuff.

855
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:55,029
Speaker 1: You're doing turn order stuff, but then I think oh well What I actually want to do like you realize the fun of this game is the corporate Shenanigans and the stock stuff like that's real fun.

856
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,780
Speaker 1: But then you're like, oh, how do I execute the plan?

857
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,440
Speaker 1: How do I fuck Scott over loot this company leave him with the shell the rotting husk?

858
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,719
Speaker 1: Like how do I pull that off?

859
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:09,393
Speaker 1: You know how to pull it off but the only way to actually execute it is to manipulate the turn order.

860
01:04:09,775 --> 01:04:14,020
Speaker 1: thus the turn order becomes the primary driver of success or failure.

861
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:21,136
Speaker 1: But even worse the turn order becomes the primary determiner of whether or not you even have the option to do the fun part of the game.

862
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:27,660
Speaker 0: So the second thing in this game is that It is not as bad as monopoly.

863
01:04:28,703 --> 01:04:30,495
Speaker 0: But we talked about this in a lot of our panels.

864
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:34,889
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The games that are over but they're not over right.

865
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:43,431
Speaker 0: so a perfectly designed game of any kind a sport You know a children's game whatever Pong is actually like.

866
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:46,400
Speaker 1: the first video game is a hundred percent perfect in this regard.

867
01:04:46,823 --> 01:04:49,240
Speaker 0: Right Pong which and well tennis is perfect.

868
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,784
Speaker 0: Which is why Pong is perfect?

869
01:04:50,844 --> 01:04:54,914
Speaker 0: because they're the same a game at the start of the game.

870
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,418
Speaker 0: a perfectly designed game.

871
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,398
Speaker 0: all Participants teams or players right in an ortho game by the way a game with winning and losing.

872
01:05:02,418 --> 01:05:05,750
Speaker 0: Yep Should have a perfectly equal chance of winning.

873
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,480
Speaker 1: So right now player player skill is a separate factor here.

874
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:16,184
Speaker 0: We're talking about in terms of reactions that a player game state Yes, we're talking about based on game state alone at the start of a game Right all.

875
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:20,738
Speaker 0: if it's a four player game all of the four players should have a 25% chance to win.

876
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:22,543
Speaker 0: if it's a two player Game at the start of the game.

877
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:24,409
Speaker 0: Both players have a 50% chance to win.

878
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:35,868
Speaker 0: right then as soon as or before right one or more of the players reaches a Hundred percent chance to win the game should end.

879
01:05:36,008 --> 01:05:43,320
Speaker 0: if someone is at a hundred percent chance to win and the game has not yet Ended they're still playing the game which is for example what happens in Monopoly.

880
01:05:43,641 --> 01:05:44,605
Speaker 0: You've won the game.

881
01:05:44,645 --> 01:05:48,680
Speaker 0: your chance of winning is a hundred percent, but other players have not yet gone bankrupt.

882
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,229
Speaker 0: So the game is not officially over the game is.

883
01:05:51,269 --> 01:05:53,477
Speaker 0: you're continuing to play a game meaninglessly.

884
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:54,200
Speaker 0: garbage time.

885
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:55,819
Speaker 0: That is a bad game design.

886
01:05:56,361 --> 01:06:07,358
Speaker 0: It is also a bad game design if one or more players have an extremely low or zero Percent chance to win and they are still playing and not eliminated.

887
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:12,400
Speaker 1: Yep So I think 18. what happens of the three we've played suffers from that the most.

888
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:16,740
Speaker 1: It's hard to say cuz 2038 I am incapable of reaching the end of that cave.

889
01:06:17,203 --> 01:06:26,180
Speaker 0: Well, I think part yeah, I think at 2038 we weren't cape We only played it once and we weren't capable of necessarily Feeling the percent chance to win, right?

890
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:34,559
Speaker 0: So like if you don't realize if no one is good enough to realize that they have won or lost already Then the game can actually continue to be fun.

891
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,364
Speaker 0: Yeah as you continue playing.

892
01:06:36,404 --> 01:06:40,154
Speaker 1: we talked about that way back way back in a review of railroad tycoon.

893
01:06:40,215 --> 01:06:47,840
Speaker 1: how even if you're losing the Manipulation of the game state is fun enough to where people tend to not care that they're losing or even real that right?

894
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,185
Speaker 0: Well, that's losing should be fun.

895
01:06:49,225 --> 01:06:50,892
Speaker 0: right is that the game should be fun.

896
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:52,620
Speaker 0: Even if you are losing and know it.

897
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:58,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying is that if you don't know you're losing right then the game can still be fun.

898
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:04,186
Speaker 0: If it wouldn't be fun if you knew you were losing exactly right or if you knew you'd already won Right.

899
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:08,193
Speaker 0: The game could potentially still be fun like 1846 didn't know?

900
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:08,759
Speaker 0: you already won.

901
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:15,520
Speaker 1: I feel like there are more players have a little more agency in the very end of the game to alter the final sorting.

902
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:19,115
Speaker 1: but in 1889 like the game ends and then it's just.

903
01:07:19,175 --> 01:07:25,639
Speaker 1: it's a spreadsheet of Alright, the last operating rounds 3x revenue that player wins and we know the game's over.

904
01:07:26,423 --> 01:07:29,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like, you know, you might get I got burnt.

905
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:30,780
Speaker 0: I made a mistake early, right?

906
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,326
Speaker 0: And that's every time I played these games.

907
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:35,520
Speaker 0: I've never won ever not even once but I keep playing them.

908
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:46,139
Speaker 0: Anyway, because every time I play I learn I make some horrible mistake that makes me lose And I learn and I don't make the same mistake again, and I just keep doing it and I make mistakes later.

909
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:59,426
Speaker 0: Right, but unlike go which is the same exact learning pattern I hate playing go even though I respect go as a game is because in go there's too many cycles Right, and there's no heuristic.

910
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:00,630
Speaker 0: I don't actually learn.

911
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,458
Speaker 0: Well, I'll play go and lose and not know why I lost.

912
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:10,419
Speaker 0: Yep If I play 1886 or 1889 I Just lost a game that took a couple days.

913
01:08:10,922 --> 01:08:15,760
Speaker 0: I learned 10 different things I did wrong and I'll never do any of those things more than once again.

914
01:08:15,923 --> 01:08:20,274
Speaker 1: And we're playing this online implementation so we can actually step back through the log like I'm looking at the first game.

915
01:08:20,294 --> 01:08:22,377
Speaker 1: we played the three-player one just to have It up on the screen.

916
01:08:22,921 --> 01:08:26,716
Speaker 1: I just look back through the log and you can pinpoint the exact moment a player made the mistake.

917
01:08:26,756 --> 01:08:31,234
Speaker 0: that loses them the game Right and notice how those mistakes I made in the first three-player game.

918
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,540
Speaker 0: I did not make in the second one.

919
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, the second one you made a mistake way later.

920
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:43,161
Speaker 1: the problem was the mistakes you made in the second game set me up to get completely screwed when up to that point I had a chance of winning Right.

921
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:44,968
Speaker 0: I think that I'll get to that later.

922
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:45,167
Speaker 0: Right?

923
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,500
Speaker 0: So so what the point is is that in this game, right?

924
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,080
Speaker 0: I had made a mistake and lost relatively early.

925
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:53,393
Speaker 0: I knew my percent chance of winning was basically zero.

926
01:08:53,493 --> 01:08:57,270
Speaker 0: once I had made that mistake It was still fun to continue playing to some extent.

927
01:08:57,691 --> 01:09:00,100
Speaker 0: but the game that's a that's a poor game design.

928
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,139
Speaker 0: The game should have eliminated me or ended the game, right?

929
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,939
Speaker 0: And then B we had reached a point in the game where we knew who won but the game was not yet over.

930
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,859
Speaker 0: You had to do two more sets of whatever just doing math to figure to reveal who had won.

931
01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:19,384
Speaker 0: But the game should have ended because someone so interestingly at least 1889.

932
01:09:19,384 --> 01:09:26,152
Speaker 1: one of the rules is if a player actually goes bankrupt the gate It's not that they're eliminated the game just immediately and that is a good rule.

933
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:33,859
Speaker 1: that if you do actually go fully bankrupt the game I feel like let's say the fiction there is the government comes in is like what the fuck just happened in here.

934
01:09:34,523 --> 01:09:35,287
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

935
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:35,930
Speaker 0: That is perfect.

936
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:40,729
Speaker 0: That actually happened to me the first time I played Or the second time I forget second time.

937
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,920
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is that that's a good rule.

938
01:09:44,261 --> 01:09:50,760
Speaker 0: But you could get really close to bankrupt without being bankrupt and the game would continue but you would be suffering and losing the whole time.

939
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:52,816
Speaker 0: Stuck in this game for no reason.

940
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:54,524
Speaker 1: Yep Now that I guess the other.

941
01:09:54,846 --> 01:10:12,015
Speaker 1: the interesting thing about the games is that the stock rounds as fun as they are They're extremely constrained in very specific ways to where a lot of the clever things you think you'd be able to do you really can't because you can sell any number of shares or Buy and or buy exactly one share,

942
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:12,880
Speaker 0: right?

943
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,770
Speaker 0: You can sell a whole bunch and buy one.

944
01:10:14,971 --> 01:10:16,640
Speaker 0: you can buy one then sell a whole bunch.

945
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:18,937
Speaker 0: Usually you would sell first to get the money to buy with.

946
01:10:18,977 --> 01:10:19,380
Speaker 0: yeah, right?

947
01:10:19,602 --> 01:10:21,340
Speaker 0: Doesn't really matter what the order is, right?

948
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,620
Speaker 0: But basically you can buy exactly one share and you can sell as many as you want and you kept it.

949
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,728
Speaker 0: You can't mix them up.

950
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:35,420
Speaker 0: You can't like sell buy sell Yeah, sell buy or buy sell and then it's the next person's turn and you can only buy one total share.

951
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:37,433
Speaker 0: This is why the turn order matters a lot.

952
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:38,259
Speaker 0: I can't just come in.

953
01:10:38,774 --> 01:10:41,953
Speaker 0: I mean I guess the turnator might matter more if you could buy as many as you want.

954
01:10:41,973 --> 01:10:43,380
Speaker 0: cuz like I go first I buy ten shares.

955
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:53,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, but but that that's where the turn order that stock round is a little is not quite granular enough Coupled with all these other rules that really can straight like there's rails on the game get it.

956
01:10:54,403 --> 01:11:04,000
Speaker 1: but the rails are things like If once someone's selling stock because you never Trump buy and sell stock between players You're basically always selling it to the market and buying it back from the market.

957
01:11:04,502 --> 01:11:08,736
Speaker 1: But there's all these rules like no one player can own more than 60% of any company.

958
01:11:09,117 --> 01:11:11,967
Speaker 1: No one player No one can sell stock into the market.

959
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:21,180
Speaker 1: Once there is 50% of the shares of that stock in the market There's all these sort of guardrails that prevent a lot of potentially interesting things from happening.

960
01:11:21,742 --> 01:11:28,719
Speaker 1: I know the reality of why those rules are in place is because with these rules as written The game does not work and breaks without those rules.

961
01:11:29,162 --> 01:11:46,947
Speaker 1: But I feel like a better designed stock round could remove a lot of those restrictions and let players go a little more hog wild while still being Interesting and while still giving players the agency to pull off those ridiculous maneuvers without giving other players No chance to defend themselves.

962
01:11:47,188 --> 01:11:49,260
Speaker 1: There's a sweet spot there that no one has found.

963
01:11:50,331 --> 01:11:56,660
Speaker 0: Yep You know I'm not sure if it's people trying who designed these games trying to stick to some sort of historical.

964
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:06,271
Speaker 1: Oh There is definitely a little bit of trying to go cult design and that a lot of 18xx games Do things because other 18xx games a person liked did them.

965
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:08,136
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's definitely it's.

966
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:13,056
Speaker 0: it feels a lot like You know, there was D&D and that everyone had their D&D mod.

967
01:12:13,076 --> 01:12:15,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, right 18xx is like.

968
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:24,420
Speaker 0: well there was the original 18xx game and then everyone published their little mod and Actually made them into real games as opposed to just their home brew, right?

969
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:31,243
Speaker 0: So it's like it's like here's a whole world of every single person's D&D homebrew where they change the rules Just the way they like.

970
01:12:31,604 --> 01:12:36,659
Speaker 0: but they have you know, they've changed them in ways that do significantly make them different.

971
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:39,370
Speaker 1: games Like 1846 and 1889 come.

972
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:41,620
Speaker 1: I engage with them completely differently.

973
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:44,652
Speaker 1: I feel completely differently about them while I'm playing.

974
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:51,715
Speaker 0: I like them both equally for different reasons Yep, but they're still at their core the same sort of thing, right?

975
01:12:51,915 --> 01:12:53,520
Speaker 0: It's not a bigger divergence, right?

976
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,169
Speaker 0: It's like fixing D&D with by making Pathfinder.

977
01:12:56,249 --> 01:12:59,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, it feels different, but it's still the same thing.

978
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:02,560
Speaker 0: It's a turn-based miniatures combat RPG kind of thing.

979
01:13:02,621 --> 01:13:07,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Even though you you you shimmied it over and fix them and that's the thing.

980
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:12,048
Speaker 1: without you didn't leave the arena without some testing and some Fuzzing around and doing some math.

981
01:13:12,349 --> 01:13:19,540
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell from play Which of those guardrail rules are there because someone found a problem and that was their solution.

982
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:24,620
Speaker 1: Versus which ones were basically copy pasted from a different 18xx game, right?

983
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,595
Speaker 0: It's very what I think is what I think is missing from a lot of these games.

984
01:13:28,715 --> 01:13:29,016
Speaker 0: Is that a?

985
01:13:30,342 --> 01:13:34,760
Speaker 0: They're clearly political games because they're multiplayer games where you can interact with each other.

986
01:13:35,281 --> 01:13:41,660
Speaker 1: We played Chris had a choice of which of the two other players who because they like we're playing this online implementation.

987
01:13:41,981 --> 01:13:52,692
Speaker 1: one cool thing it does is it shows that any time the total worth of any player because in the end your score is how much money you personally have Including all us here the value of your stocks Yeah.

988
01:13:52,901 --> 01:13:58,884
Speaker 1: So it shows that at Every pointer in the game and there was a critical turn where you are already done You were out of the game.

989
01:13:59,206 --> 01:14:04,795
Speaker 1: your worth was like half everyone else's But the rest of us were basically equal in worth.

990
01:14:05,076 --> 01:14:13,040
Speaker 1: and on that round Chris dumped a bunch of the stock and a company that I own the most of instead of someone else which pulled me way down.

991
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:14,482
Speaker 1: There's.

992
01:14:14,502 --> 01:14:15,706
Speaker 1: that is a political decision.

993
01:14:15,726 --> 01:14:17,614
Speaker 1: I like that about these games.

994
01:14:17,634 --> 01:14:19,260
Speaker 1: Like I don't want them to become a political.

995
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,564
Speaker 1: That's a very different kind of game.

996
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:23,795
Speaker 1: But the politics is definitely there though.

997
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,400
Speaker 1: I think what are a lot of players?

998
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,440
Speaker 1: It's highly obfuscated by the mechanics.

999
01:14:28,561 --> 01:14:34,286
Speaker 1: I think a lot of players think these games are more deterministic than they are and Don't understand.

1000
01:14:34,306 --> 01:14:35,230
Speaker 0: There's no randomness.

1001
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no randomness other than the original turn order.

1002
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,182
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

1003
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:46,708
Speaker 0: So I think that what I want what I want politics wise is I wish there were more enforceable Politics just a little bit right?

1004
01:14:46,728 --> 01:14:54,097
Speaker 0: So for example, let's say two people Bought too many private companies in the original auction and they can't float alone, right?

1005
01:14:55,081 --> 01:14:57,708
Speaker 0: But they could float together, right if they wanted to.

1006
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:07,467
Speaker 0: but because of turn order one person the person who goes first would have by The first share help and then that next person is not Man, they don't they can't.

1007
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:09,478
Speaker 0: there's nothing to enforce them to say you're floating.

1008
01:15:09,518 --> 01:15:11,126
Speaker 1: this game Scott starts to float.

1009
01:15:11,146 --> 01:15:11,889
Speaker 1: a company is like room.

1010
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:15,996
Speaker 1: I can float this if you help me and I'm like, yeah sure comes to my Turn I float a different company.

1011
01:15:16,036 --> 01:15:17,563
Speaker 1: Fuck you Right.

1012
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:19,478
Speaker 0: It's just no there's nothing to do about it, right?

1013
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:20,866
Speaker 0: I wish there was some.

1014
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:21,992
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's some of these.

1015
01:15:22,575 --> 01:15:23,580
Speaker 0: 18xx have deal-making.

1016
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, there shouldn't be just free wheelie deal.

1017
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,957
Speaker 1: deal make no cuz they're just making us general up like a badge.

1018
01:15:28,997 --> 01:15:29,900
Speaker 1: that are real confluence.

1019
01:15:30,202 --> 01:15:30,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, no.

1020
01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:35,289
Speaker 0: No, I don't want that level of stuff But I do want there should be some sort of.

1021
01:15:35,309 --> 01:15:36,934
Speaker 0: you know, there is a solution.

1022
01:15:37,536 --> 01:15:50,215
Speaker 0: There's a very especially That also helps you with that problem of your chance to win is low You clearly see another winner if you could make a for sure alliance right of some kind.

1023
01:15:50,456 --> 01:15:51,799
Speaker 0: that's somewhat enforceable.

1024
01:15:51,819 --> 01:16:05,048
Speaker 0: or as actual in-game Effect there is a specific solution that I pass to coming back that I almost want to try to Write down and try to play 1889.

1025
01:16:05,048 --> 01:16:08,520
Speaker 1: I might just play it by myself just to make sure the math all works.

1026
01:16:09,026 --> 01:16:10,180
Speaker 1: There's an elegant solution to that.

1027
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,520
Speaker 1: But before I reveal my elegant solution, I want to back up to another point you made about the politics.

1028
01:16:15,442 --> 01:16:29,270
Speaker 1: one flaw in these games is that political risk Which what I mean by that is there are actions you can take in this game that are not that do not expose you to Political risk meaning because you bought 10% of a company.

1029
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:32,160
Speaker 1: No one can just arbitrarily fuck you over because of that.

1030
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:41,694
Speaker 1: But once you buy 20% of a company that someone else owns depending on turn order You've opened yourself up to political risk where another player may have.

1031
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:46,007
Speaker 0: if you have a better turn order You haven't opened yourself up But at least not in the next round.

1032
01:16:46,067 --> 01:16:48,136
Speaker 0: because and but then if the turn order word?

1033
01:16:48,156 --> 01:16:51,733
Speaker 0: because as long as you can make it To the next round you could just sell the shares and you're safe.

1034
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:56,400
Speaker 1: There's almost no Operational risk and minimal market risk in this game.

1035
01:16:56,742 --> 01:17:07,018
Speaker 1: The only risk you can actually expose yourself to is political risk Which means that generally if you're tied or slightly behind the only options you have to get ahead.

1036
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:16,167
Speaker 1: There's no Like risk assessment you can do because all the actions that only incur market risk will not Be enough to matter.

1037
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:18,860
Speaker 1: so you end up having to expose yourself to political risk.

1038
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:22,340
Speaker 1: But there's no low-level political risk in this game.

1039
01:17:22,621 --> 01:17:28,620
Speaker 1: If you expose yourself to a political risk in this game either you're fine, or you're completely fucked.

1040
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:31,251
Speaker 1: There's almost no little ground can't any point.

1041
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:33,300
Speaker 0: You can't actually climb in this game.

1042
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:35,379
Speaker 0: All you can do is push other people down.

1043
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:42,711
Speaker 0: See if you push everyone else down because they expose themselves and got burned and you're left on top Yeah, you've got all this money.

1044
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:43,680
Speaker 0: You can buy all the shares.

1045
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,844
Speaker 0: You will just naturally rise.

1046
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:46,049
Speaker 0: all the companies just rise.

1047
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:48,960
Speaker 1: so I got burned once in the late game, which is fine.

1048
01:17:49,001 --> 01:17:49,718
Speaker 1: That's what you expect.

1049
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:51,266
Speaker 1: So now I was behind a little bit.

1050
01:17:51,607 --> 01:18:02,699
Speaker 1: the two players who were ahead of me were neck and neck and there was nothing I could Do to push down both of them and due to the way the stocks evolved I ended up not being able to push down either of them in any meaningful way.

1051
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:06,371
Speaker 1: Meanwhile you were basically out of the game.

1052
01:18:06,411 --> 01:18:09,380
Speaker 1: pushing you down would help me a little but it wouldn't hurt.

1053
01:18:09,661 --> 01:18:13,159
Speaker 1: It's like hurting you doesn't matter and helping me doesn't help you to hurt me.

1054
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:17,861
Speaker 0: Yep, I can help you to hurt me if I've already taken a hurt exactly but simultaneously I'm already out.

1055
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:18,683
Speaker 1: there was no action.

1056
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:24,866
Speaker 1: We could take together to try to rise up together Because it was late-game.

1057
01:18:25,087 --> 01:18:26,212
Speaker 0: there were no not with not.

1058
01:18:26,232 --> 01:18:27,517
Speaker 0: what they've not with the rules is written.

1059
01:18:27,558 --> 01:18:29,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly Those are the kinds I think.

1060
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:31,900
Speaker 0: the other things is that if you want to I would either.

1061
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,590
Speaker 0: So because the turn order is so important.

1062
01:18:35,914 --> 01:18:44,387
Speaker 0: I think I would either a put in more direct turn order Mitigation or management mechanics.

1063
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:47,699
Speaker 0: so for example you might bid on turn order you might.

1064
01:18:48,402 --> 01:18:54,860
Speaker 0: Everyone starts at the same amount of money right, but if going first is better Why should the first player start with the same amount of money right?

1065
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,065
Speaker 0: It's like a basic board game.

1066
01:18:56,105 --> 01:18:56,707
Speaker 0: balance thing.

1067
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,258
Speaker 0: right is like Puerto Rico the first three people get in to go.

1068
01:18:59,298 --> 01:19:00,725
Speaker 0: the last two people Get corn cuz going.

1069
01:19:00,765 --> 01:19:01,429
Speaker 0: last is worse.

1070
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:03,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the corn balances it out, right?

1071
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:16,689
Speaker 0: It's like this simple stuff like that to mitigate that turn order thing a little bit yeah, but you can't mitigate it too much without making others and even changes to the or or Eliminate turn order and make it more about simultaneous actions.

1072
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:20,358
Speaker 0: if you eliminate turn order now the game is actually about.

1073
01:19:20,398 --> 01:19:21,060
Speaker 0: that's what I'm on.

1074
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:26,033
Speaker 1: I want to workshop and try not about turn order with the idea of a simultaneous market.

1075
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:31,540
Speaker 1: like you basically write a limit price On a bunch of orders you've reveal them all simultaneously.

1076
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:37,796
Speaker 1: players orders execute against each other and then anything that doesn't execute against a player executes against the back.

1077
01:19:38,077 --> 01:19:58,619
Speaker 1: there's a system you could come up with but one of my worries is that if you remove that obfuscation and remove the player turn order and Made the stock rounds like more of a game I think what happens is you reveal how little Most of the other mechanics matter to the point that they can be completely eliminated And you've made a completely different game.

1078
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's what it is.

1079
01:20:00,724 --> 01:20:03,090
Speaker 0: is that all of the 18 excess games.

1080
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:07,362
Speaker 0: I've played it's that there is these multiple It's.

1081
01:20:07,743 --> 01:20:16,136
Speaker 0: it's hard to develop heuristics and make decisions because the thing you're directly Interacting with is is sort of hiding the truth.

1082
01:20:16,157 --> 01:20:16,820
Speaker 1: You know what it's like.

1083
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,489
Speaker 0: It's like playing always talk about how it's it right.

1084
01:20:19,529 --> 01:20:24,260
Speaker 0: well people talk about it's a spreadsheet game right, but it's like well, okay There's a lot of spreadsheet games out there.

1085
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,572
Speaker 0: You know people are talking about like you know Eve or whatever Eve online right.

1086
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:29,500
Speaker 0: the way this spreadsheet works.

1087
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:33,120
Speaker 0: Is that your the inputs you have right?

1088
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,031
Speaker 0: It's like you're taking turns messing with the spreadsheet first of all.

1089
01:20:36,091 --> 01:20:38,400
Speaker 0: so when you when you get to mess with it matters a ton.

1090
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,419
Speaker 0: Oh because who knows what it's gonna look like by the time you get your hands on it?

1091
01:20:41,983 --> 01:20:44,903
Speaker 0: You could only put an inputs on the far left Right.

1092
01:20:45,385 --> 01:20:49,200
Speaker 0: those inputs directly affect things like on page two of the spreadsheet.

1093
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:52,500
Speaker 0: So you're looking at page one and page two right and you're like okay?

1094
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,486
Speaker 0: I'll take this on page one.

1095
01:20:53,526 --> 01:20:54,492
Speaker 0: this happens on page two.

1096
01:20:54,552 --> 01:20:59,840
Speaker 0: I type this on page one this up And that's where you're thinking right when you're when you're new to these games.

1097
01:21:00,301 --> 01:21:09,968
Speaker 0: But actually page two is affecting something on page three and maybe even page four and that's what the real game is and you Can't see that because it's not told to you.

1098
01:21:10,389 --> 01:21:22,596
Speaker 0: You have to just like dig deep and be like oh Buying this share here Right means that the value that is the tenth share in this company's the end of the stock round.

1099
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:23,379
Speaker 0: it will bump up.

1100
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:24,363
Speaker 0: it will Bump up.

1101
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:25,872
Speaker 0: therefore it will go first.

1102
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,340
Speaker 0: It is someone else's company.

1103
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,303
Speaker 0: They get to go first.

1104
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:40,694
Speaker 0: therefore that company will be able to put a token on that spot on the train track Which means that the company that goes after it is gonna Its trains are gonna run shittily because that token will be blocking them.

1105
01:21:41,136 --> 01:21:41,356
Speaker 0: right.

1106
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:46,749
Speaker 0: so it's like oh You're thinking when you made that decision Right just like oh that company.

1107
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:47,793
Speaker 0: That's a valuable share.

1108
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:49,440
Speaker 0: It's gonna increase in value.

1109
01:21:49,702 --> 01:21:52,140
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't I buy a sound investment right?

1110
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:58,380
Speaker 0: But actually you have fucked over this other company quite a bit because of the token situation on the map.

1111
01:21:58,884 --> 01:22:03,709
Speaker 0: Right by buying a share Which is you can't see that kind of thing.

1112
01:22:03,749 --> 01:22:04,712
Speaker 0: how are you concerned?

1113
01:22:04,772 --> 01:22:07,460
Speaker 1: on obvious you get to the situation where you can see it?

1114
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:20,740
Speaker 1: but you have no agency to manipulate the turn order to avoid it because of Some other player passed and now there's like there's literally no way to get the player to your left to take an action before you pass.

1115
01:22:20,963 --> 01:22:22,238
Speaker 1: There's no way to go first.

1116
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:27,817
Speaker 0: Right it's like okay now that I've seen that this token thing is a possibility right.

1117
01:22:27,897 --> 01:22:28,540
Speaker 0: What can I do?

1118
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:29,744
Speaker 0: It's like you're not.

1119
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:31,032
Speaker 0: there's no move you make.

1120
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:32,098
Speaker 0: that's like they get ahead.

1121
01:22:32,218 --> 01:22:36,359
Speaker 1: move It's the overt disaster disaster or fuck someone else and get way ahead.

1122
01:22:37,105 --> 01:22:39,901
Speaker 0: It's basically don't step on landmine Yes Right.

1123
01:22:40,303 --> 01:22:44,776
Speaker 0: and then hope try to get other players to step on your land mines that you set.

1124
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:45,859
Speaker 0: now don't think they steps.

1125
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:46,441
Speaker 0: all you know What this?

1126
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:47,043
Speaker 0: everyone's.

1127
01:22:47,164 --> 01:22:48,931
Speaker 0: everyone's always walking forward.

1128
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:52,743
Speaker 1: 18xx games are just spy versus spy on the NES Kind.

1129
01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:53,728
Speaker 0: that's what this game.

1130
01:22:53,808 --> 01:22:54,291
Speaker 0: everyone's.

1131
01:22:54,431 --> 01:23:03,570
Speaker 0: everyone is always marching forward Right and you sort of snowball as you move forward because the more money you have the more money you make in a stock market Right the more shares you own.

1132
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:04,112
Speaker 0: right.

1133
01:23:04,253 --> 01:23:05,318
Speaker 0: all the shares are moving up.

1134
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:10,377
Speaker 0: mostly they can move down a little bit but but can't really like lose all your money on a bad event.

1135
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:17,180
Speaker 1: despite the fact that we Just spent like 45 minutes kind of like really nitpicking all these fiddly rules and complaining about them.

1136
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:19,299
Speaker 1: These games are still very fun.

1137
01:23:20,016 --> 01:23:24,191
Speaker 0: Yeah I think that's the thing that's that makes this such so much discussion about them.

1138
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:32,726
Speaker 0: is that there's this core that is crazy fun Right and you you learn something new every time that you can Unlike go where you lose.

1139
01:23:32,746 --> 01:23:33,669
Speaker 0: you don't know why you lost.

1140
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:36,660
Speaker 0: you lose every time and you know why you lost and you keep improving.

1141
01:23:37,206 --> 01:23:38,258
Speaker 0: Which gives you this fun?

1142
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,866
Speaker 0: Cycle of learning every single time.

1143
01:23:40,886 --> 01:23:43,916
Speaker 0: right you get lots even if you lose.

1144
01:23:44,157 --> 01:23:46,667
Speaker 0: right you get this Sort of reward.

1145
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,077
Speaker 0: right you don't feel bad about it.

1146
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:51,822
Speaker 0: it's fun to play and What you?

1147
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:57,649
Speaker 0: there's a strong desire, which is why every time we talk about these games I feel like people who play these games.

1148
01:23:58,051 --> 01:24:04,092
Speaker 0: when I see them talk they talk about the game Whereas when me and rim talk we talk about how to fix the game.

1149
01:24:04,112 --> 01:24:05,497
Speaker 0: yep, and the read.

1150
01:24:05,537 --> 01:24:19,280
Speaker 0: we do that for every game But we do it especially for these games because there's this sort of disappointment and also sort of Excitement of having like you found a buried treasure, but we need to drag it out of the dungeon.

1151
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:20,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, because like the game's bad.

1152
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:22,160
Speaker 1: We don't nitpick the mechanics.

1153
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,240
Speaker 1: We look at the mechanics like wow fuck this game, and we don't exactly don't want to save it.

1154
01:24:26,481 --> 01:24:27,746
Speaker 1: We're happy to let it die.

1155
01:24:27,806 --> 01:24:28,650
Speaker 0: we don't even we're like.

1156
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:33,180
Speaker 0: we're like oh man look at this great stuff We found in this 18xx game.

1157
01:24:33,681 --> 01:24:38,035
Speaker 0: How the hell do we get this good stuff out and not and and remove all this mess.

1158
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:38,657
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

1159
01:24:38,697 --> 01:24:47,180
Speaker 1: so if 18xx games are just Are just five or spy on the NES then you and I playing 18xx games is just torchbearer.

1160
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:52,040
Speaker 1: We're just trying to get the stock round and the operating round out of the dungeon somehow.

1161
01:24:52,643 --> 01:24:55,260
Speaker 0: Well there are games out there the city of the big shoulders.

1162
01:24:55,783 --> 01:24:57,352
Speaker 1: They always leave something be.

1163
01:24:57,452 --> 01:24:58,156
Speaker 0: I learned about this.

1164
01:24:58,257 --> 01:25:00,563
Speaker 0: other one recently Called what was?

1165
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:03,672
Speaker 0: I forget what it was called, but basically it's a game where there's still.

1166
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:17,708
Speaker 0: they'd have that meta game of stock buying and then operating right and I think That's a good that people have recognized that you could take that meta structure where the meta game is the real game Around some other game.

1167
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:31,700
Speaker 0: that could be literally anything like you could take carcass Oh, and I'd be like all right instead of you being a color We're gonna buy stocks in the different colors and then after we've done buying stocks Whoever has the most stocks in a color will place the tile and the meeple for that color.

1168
01:25:31,841 --> 01:25:35,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then shareholders get victory points split among themselves.

1169
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:37,664
Speaker 0: Right exactly, and it's like you know.

1170
01:25:37,684 --> 01:25:40,148
Speaker 0: you could just play the stock carcass on like that.

1171
01:25:40,188 --> 01:25:41,190
Speaker 0: right you do it to any game.

1172
01:25:42,081 --> 01:25:49,615
Speaker 0: So that's been recognized and done, but I think there is so much potential in that model that has been Unfulfilled.

1173
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:53,014
Speaker 0: yeah Desire to work on that.

1174
01:25:53,054 --> 01:26:01,650
Speaker 1: for whatever reason 18xx games have touched the face of God in all these places But they haven't quite pulled it all together under coherent experience.

1175
01:26:03,112 --> 01:26:06,129
Speaker 0: It's like they're sitting on the face of God, but they don't know it.

1176
01:26:07,353 --> 01:26:10,490
Speaker 0: Like they're riding around on a giant turtle, but they don't know they're on giant turtle.

1177
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:11,837
Speaker 1: I think it's partly because the games are.

1178
01:26:11,858 --> 01:26:15,196
Speaker 0: it's like I see the turtle and I'm like oh my god How do I ride on the turtle.

1179
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:18,030
Speaker 1: but also I've noticed that the community around these games?

1180
01:26:18,271 --> 01:26:21,630
Speaker 1: Tends to hyper focus on the games themselves, and it's relatively small.

1181
01:26:22,351 --> 01:26:25,830
Speaker 1: And I'm not saying they don't recognize flaws in the games and have opinions about them.

1182
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:30,529
Speaker 0: But they have to be very all have different opinions with which ones they like the best and you know.

1183
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:36,466
Speaker 1: But there's very little like willingness to discuss radical changes to the games like that doesn't I know.

1184
01:26:36,506 --> 01:26:39,161
Speaker 0: they want to play 18xx They want to play what it is.

1185
01:26:39,242 --> 01:26:40,170
Speaker 0: They don't want to play.

1186
01:26:40,652 --> 01:26:44,204
Speaker 0: They don't want to just take these certain parts that we like where we like parts.

1187
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:45,950
Speaker 0: They like everything that's in there.

1188
01:26:46,593 --> 01:26:50,270
Speaker 1: So to get back to the thing I said before then I think we've talked about this game enough.

1189
01:26:50,912 --> 01:26:59,412
Speaker 1: The way to fix that binding problem without making it a game where we're just making deals forever like binding deals is to add Without changing any other rule in 1889.

1190
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:00,836
Speaker 1: I think this would work.

1191
01:27:01,197 --> 01:27:05,188
Speaker 1: you add the concept players a third option during the stock round.

1192
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:12,210
Speaker 1: you can buy You can sell or you can sell a futures contract to another player.

1193
01:27:12,431 --> 01:27:15,063
Speaker 0: Well there is one that there's a New York one that has short selling.

1194
01:27:15,324 --> 01:27:16,469
Speaker 1: yeah short sell.

1195
01:27:16,489 --> 01:27:19,979
Speaker 1: well I have ideas about short selling But that doesn't solve the problem of you.

1196
01:27:20,019 --> 01:27:24,297
Speaker 1: and I want to make a deal to float a company Right with a futures contract.

1197
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:26,807
Speaker 1: the way it would work is I would sell you.

1198
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,510
Speaker 1: let's say we want to flow I want to float a company.

1199
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:32,664
Speaker 1: I want to get you to agree to help me float that company you actually want to.

1200
01:27:32,985 --> 01:27:39,732
Speaker 1: but the game has non-binding rules And we both know whichever one of us moves first the other one's just gonna fuck them over and go over someone else Right.

1201
01:27:39,752 --> 01:27:40,656
Speaker 0: so that's the best move.

1202
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,924
Speaker 1: so I sell you a futures contract.

1203
01:27:43,205 --> 01:27:44,930
Speaker 1: I say for $300.

1204
01:27:44,930 --> 01:28:01,836
Speaker 1: I Will sell you a contract where in x-turns or in one turn or I gotta figure out the details on this you Must buy three shares of that company from me or this or ice or have them Now.

1205
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:02,966
Speaker 1: buy them from me.

1206
01:28:04,531 --> 01:28:06,317
Speaker 0: Alright you give me cash now.

1207
01:28:06,498 --> 01:28:08,325
Speaker 1: now I have your cash and my cash.

1208
01:28:08,566 --> 01:28:09,670
Speaker 1: you have a futures contract.

1209
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:11,620
Speaker 1: You are obligated to buy those shares from me.

1210
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,609
Speaker 1: I am obligated to sell them to you.

1211
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:18,838
Speaker 1: we have agreed on the price of that transaction and cash was exchanged accordingly.

1212
01:28:18,858 --> 01:28:23,410
Speaker 1: and then as I buy all the stock I go through the whole float.

1213
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:27,530
Speaker 1: I float the whole thing and then I hand those shares over to you for the agreed-upon price.

1214
01:28:28,114 --> 01:28:29,181
Speaker 0: Right two turns later.

1215
01:28:29,302 --> 01:28:29,926
Speaker 0: Here's the shares.

1216
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:39,167
Speaker 1: yep And yeah, I think that would work without changing any other rule in 1889 But I don't know if I am non lazy enough to try it.

1217
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:40,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows?

1218
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:51,110
Speaker 1: Play testing is the is the hard part of game making yep And you can only get so far just reading your own rules and playing your game in your mind or playing it against yourself.

1219
01:28:52,050 --> 01:29:01,087
Speaker 1: Yep, that's a good way to design a game that only you are good at sure All right, so yeah 1889. now we've talked about three of these different train games.

1220
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:09,233
Speaker 1: if I had to rank them 1889 still my favorite then 1846 and 2038 is without a digital implementation Unplayable by me.

1221
01:29:10,216 --> 01:29:13,427
Speaker 0: I just haven't played enough of them to have a real opinion on favorite.

1222
01:29:13,528 --> 01:29:15,558
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I'm I do want to play.

1223
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:16,161
Speaker 1: I want to play.

1224
01:29:16,282 --> 01:29:17,650
Speaker 0: do you want to yeah?

1225
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:25,822
Speaker 0: I do want to call attention to on the GMT games website There is currently it's sort of.

1226
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:26,224
Speaker 0: it's not.

1227
01:29:26,485 --> 01:29:37,950
Speaker 0: it's not a Kickstarter But basically they have this program They call the p500 program where when enough copies of a game are pre-ordered then they make the game.

1228
01:29:39,377 --> 01:29:51,839
Speaker 0: So there is a game 1833 ne which is 1833, New England Rariting in New England and it is an 18xx game and it's on a New England map.

1229
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:59,425
Speaker 0: and They are have already been 734 orders of this game and if you order it now it'll cost you $58.

1230
01:29:59,425 --> 01:30:01,934
Speaker 0: you wait It'll cost you $84.

1231
01:30:01,934 --> 01:30:06,241
Speaker 0: so I ordered it already for $58.

1232
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:11,470
Speaker 0: I'll play that but And it's an 18xx game and not a New England map.

1233
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:15,025
Speaker 0: And I think that it also comes with an 1846 like mini expansion.

1234
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:23,096
Speaker 0: so if you already have 1846 or if you have a friend who has 1846 then You're good to go.

1235
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:30,630
Speaker 0: and also the designer of 1833, New England is Tom Lehman who has made almost most of the great games.

1236
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:32,262
Speaker 0: you know.

1237
01:30:32,887 --> 01:30:35,757
Speaker 0: so You know race for the galaxy.

1238
01:30:35,777 --> 01:30:40,091
Speaker 0: I think right pretty sure that's the guy Right.

1239
01:30:40,634 --> 01:30:42,783
Speaker 0: yeah for the galaxy pandemic great.

1240

Speaker 1: I'm just.

1242
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:46,883
Speaker 1: I'm looking at the map of 1833 ne right now.

1243
01:30:49,072 --> 01:30:50,270
