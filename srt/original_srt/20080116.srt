00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:17,855
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm a Scott and this is a geeky night tonight for the first time in a long time.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,042
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

Speaker 0: It's Wednesday this breakfast.

8
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,669
Speaker 0: I get me a bagel of course.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,200
Speaker 0: I was a little slow on the bagel action So I actually got like one of the last bagels.

10
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:49,996
Speaker 0: I took this poppy seed bagel that was looking kind of haggard and the only other bagels left in there were like this salt Bagel and these sort of nobody likes the salt bagel and like these brown bagels that were.

11
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:54,294
Speaker 0: obviously that we I don't know But I think it was like a pumpernickel bagel or something.

12
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,440
Speaker 1: Oh, that sounds really good.

13
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:56,442
Speaker 0: It was.

14
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:57,426
Speaker 0: he was not popular.

15
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:03,570
Speaker 0: That's just because people don't understand now, so I toast my Second-rate poppy seed bagel.

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,174
Speaker 0: I go back.

17
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:05,080
Speaker 0: I need a beverage.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just drank some orangey, but I still need something to wash the bagel down.

19
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,360
Speaker 0: drink the orangey before the bagel.

20
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:15,440
Speaker 0: So I go to get some water and now the water cooler at our work doesn't actually get water in it.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,833
Speaker 0: Well, it does, but you don't have to put the stupid bottle.

22
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:21,339
Speaker 0: water cooler doesn't have water You don't have to put the stupid bottles in it.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:21,802
Speaker 0: It's just.

24
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:27,091
Speaker 0: it's hooked up to the tap and has a filtered tank in it And you just put your cup under.

25
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:28,520
Speaker 0: you push the button and you're good to go.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,733
Speaker 0: You put your Nalgene and you push the button and water comes out All right, and it's cold and it's from the tap and it's New York.

27
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,596
Speaker 0: So doesn't matter, right?

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,856
Speaker 0: I Go to push the button and for the first time ever Nothing comes out.

29
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:45,200
Speaker 1: So I'm like, huh, you know, that's a really unexpected.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,540
Speaker 1: I mean there have been a couple of times in my life where I turn on a faucet and nothing comes out.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:00,920
Speaker 1: but the thing is usually when that happens if it's not through like if it's a normal faucet if There isn't water there instead of water you get possibly some brown sludge, but usually a horrible banging noise.

32
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:04,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, now it just kind of word little, you know compressor in there.

33
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,219
Speaker 0: I guess word a bit and nothing came out says, huh?

34
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:13,139
Speaker 0: So I'm just like fuck it and I go sit down again and then there's an email a little while later like yeah We have no water.

35
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:16,279
Speaker 1: That's what you get for having some like those.

36
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,087
Speaker 0: There's like a broken water.

37
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:20,256
Speaker 0: main on everything in the city is always.

38
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:24,011
Speaker 0: it's never the building It's always something happened on some street somewhere.

39
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,799
Speaker 0: It's like water main broke on X Street.

40
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:29,040
Speaker 0: Telephone switch broke on Y Street, you know, you know.

41
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,946
Speaker 0: Anyway, a water main broke on some street.

42
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,471
Speaker 0: So we didn't have water.

43
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:39,012
Speaker 0: I think the 12th floor had water and Probably maybe because we're on the second floor.

44
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,420
Speaker 1: There's a tank at the top of the building.

45
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:43,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we had to go like 10 floors up if you needed to pee, which you know.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,860
Speaker 1: There's been some scary stories about those tanks because usually no one maintains them and there's been some interesting things found floating in them.

47
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:49,604
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

48
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,277
Speaker 0: Yes, indeed, but I did not go to the 12th floor.

49
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:52,740
Speaker 0: I held it in.

50
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:56,655
Speaker 1: Not like in that movie that short.

51
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,318
Speaker 0: I didn't need to go.

52
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,229
Speaker 0: that bad Anyway, but my co-worker right.

53
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,067
Speaker 0: so normally it sucks if electricity goes out you can go home But if water goes out you got to stay.

54
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:09,583
Speaker 1: All right, so my co-worker then water was the only thing that ever made RIT shut down.

55
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:10,907
Speaker 0: I know right 9/11.

56
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,352
Speaker 1: We're going 12 feet of snow.

57
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,014
Speaker 1: That's fine.

58
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:24,086
Speaker 0: No water send the kids home Yep, but then my co-worker, you know, he was getting pretty pissed you know, he's gonna go out to like a restaurant to pee or something, but then His computer stops working.

59
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,773
Speaker 0: Like I think his power supply died.

60
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,580
Speaker 0: pretty sure that that's the current diagnosis.

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,768
Speaker 0: I think it's obvious that he sabotaged it so he could go home and the other co-worker whose job it is to fix that Sick today, so he just went home.

62
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,132
Speaker 0: No, it was actually broken.

63
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:36,634
Speaker 0: I checked it.

64
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:38,440
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm not doubting that it was broken.

65
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,546
Speaker 1: I'm wondering how it came to be broken.

66
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,749
Speaker 0: He didn't sabotage it.

67
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,191
Speaker 0: Trust me.

68
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,936
Speaker 1: There wasn't a paperclip sticking.

69
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:45,360
Speaker 0: I checked it.

70
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,719
Speaker 0: Maybe then again, maybe he let me check it so he'd have proof.

71
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:51,927
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he goes home.

72
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,044
Speaker 0: I'm sitting there and eventually after a few hours I'm like, I couldn't.

73
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,353
Speaker 0: I was think I was gonna make lunch and at work.

74
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 0: I have peanut butter and jelly and a knife.

75
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,259
Speaker 0: I couldn't clean the knife to make lunch.

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Speaker 0: Wow, so eventually I get fed up and I go over back to the water cooler thing and I put my nalgene under there.

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,051
Speaker 1: I push the button and water comes out, you know, usually when there's a water main break You're not supposed to use the water that comes out for like 12 hours.

78
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:17,397
Speaker 0: I know but I said fuck it.

79
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,120
Speaker 0: I'm using this.

80
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:19,846
Speaker 1: Oh, you're gonna die or whatever.

81
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,780
Speaker 0: I know well, it was going through the filter in that little machine, right?

82
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,447
Speaker 0: So I was okay.

83
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:24,580
Speaker 1: Is there a filter there?

84
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,582
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a machine.

85
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:32,204
Speaker 0: that's just a filter and a compressor and a cooler and the tap water comes into it through a little hose and you Push a button and the water comes out.

86
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:32,947
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

87
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,540
Speaker 0: So I push the button the water comes out and I'm like, ah But I didn't think the water was fixed.

88
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:45,755
Speaker 0: I just thought I got lucky and I got the last of the water or something like that Even though that doesn't make sense since previously no water was coming out at all.

89
00:04:46,157 --> 00:04:46,639
Speaker 0: I didn't care.

90
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:52,260
Speaker 0: So then I'm like, alright and then I go back to my desk and there's you know an email that says the water is fixed.

91
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,415
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh that explains it.

92
00:04:54,061 --> 00:05:07,468
Speaker 0: so I go to the sink and I clean off my knife and the sink was pretty funny because when I put the sink when I put the sink on hot water it came out normally right because the hot water, you know Must have been in a tank somewhere, you know waiting around But the cold water was

93
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:07,809
Speaker 1: a minute.

94
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:14,912
Speaker 0: if that means you probably could have used the hot water to wash your knife I know But the cold water was like put put put put put put put.

95
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:16,096
Speaker 0: it was pretty funny.

96
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,100
Speaker 0: I like the cold water.

97
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,498
Speaker 0: He was making the sink jump up and down.

98
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:23,320
Speaker 1: So did you have the classic problem whenever water starts up again of the infinitely flushing toilet?

99
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:25,807
Speaker 0: Well, you why are you stealing my thunder?

100
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:26,872
Speaker 1: because that happens.

101
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:27,755
Speaker 1: It's a common thing.

102
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:28,740
Speaker 0: Why you got me doing that?

103
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:33,840
Speaker 0: I was giving you the opportunity because I was gonna bring it up in a second.

104
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,663
Speaker 0: I was next.

105
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:39,578
Speaker 1: all of you out there understand how excited Scott was about the fact that the toilet wouldn't stop flush.

106
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,080
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

107
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,140
Speaker 0: So our bathroom is notorious for that being shitty.

108
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:47,091
Speaker 0: It's like the worst bathroom ever cuz on the second floor.

109
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,480
Speaker 0: so all these UPS guys use it and shit and it sucks.

110
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,111
Speaker 0: But you know after I make my lunch and whatnot.

111
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,215
Speaker 0: I gotta finally pee.

112
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,300
Speaker 0: I finally drank water.

113
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,225
Speaker 0: So now I had to pee.

114
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:02,247
Speaker 0: I go in there and I hear a toilet flushing And I pee and I still hear this toilet flushing.

115
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 0: I go over there and this toilet is flushing and it's not stopping.

116
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,580
Speaker 0: It just keeps flushing and blushing.

117
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:11,951
Speaker 0: Water keeps coming out and water keeps going down.

118
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,682
Speaker 0: It's like it's permanent cyclone and I'm like, oh man We're gonna go.

119
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:16,826
Speaker 1: Did you tell anyone?

120
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,953
Speaker 0: No, I just let it go.

121
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,518
Speaker 1: I should have told someone.

122
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,160
Speaker 1: What do I care?

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,180
Speaker 0: I still go and no it's not cuz I went in later wasn't going anymore.

124
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,128
Speaker 0: but Yeah, it was pretty funny to watch this toilet.

125
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,755
Speaker 0: Just keep going and going.

126
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,040
Speaker 0: it was like a perpetual toilet.

127
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they see perpetual motion machines are not possible.

128
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:34,860
Speaker 0: explain that toilet.

129
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:36,363
Speaker 0: It kept going.

130
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:45,214
Speaker 1: So what today I had to listen to some guy tell me this story on how the water was out in his building And I was flushing infinitely something like that.

131
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:46,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

132
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:53,811
Speaker 1: There's you know, I was looking at the anime news, you know, it's anime day and you know ostensibly manga comic day But there's never news about manga.

133
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,321

139
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,533
Speaker 1: There's nothing I care about to talk about.

140
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,518
Speaker 0: there is nada.

141
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:15,680
Speaker 1: So, uh, I figured I should do a some sort of geek bite cuz it's been a while or a geek back.

142
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:17,393
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a geek bite for me.

143
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:22,520
Speaker 1: Okay, I Long time ago, you know, I read the first ghost in the shell manga.

144
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:25,319
Speaker 1: It was it was kind of epic and awesome and I really enjoyed it.

145
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,186
Speaker 0: It's something any manga fan should read.

146
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:32,723
Speaker 0: really any comic any comic reading person should read that at some point no matter if you like Manga or not.

147
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,996
Speaker 0: you really it's one of those necessities up there with like the watchman.

148
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,366
Speaker 0: It's not as good as watchman But it is really good.

149
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:38,989
Speaker 0: It's really good.

150
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,440
Speaker 0: It's not watchman good, but it's this necessity to read it.

151
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,062
Speaker 0: You gotta read it.

152
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,232
Speaker 1: Scott had had the issues of the second manga.

153
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:46,657
Speaker 0: That's actually funnily enough.

154
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:51,420
Speaker 0: I Stopped buying comics and I was a kid right when the comic book store in the mall went out of business.

155
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,175
Speaker 0: Right and when I was a kid, I read x-men and I read spider-man 2099, right?

156
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,071
Speaker 0: I stopped reading them, you know when the comic store out of business.

157
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:09,460
Speaker 0: I didn't read comics again until Like around 2000, you know when I was in college He went to the borders right and we go to the borders every once in a while to hang out look at stuff.

158
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,327
Speaker 0: You know, they had the meager manga shelf.

159
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,057
Speaker 0: Remember that manga shelf and everything on it was amazing.

160
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:14,800
Speaker 0: Even if it was crap.

161
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:21,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was great and we'd go to that manga shelf and I almost bought some manga.

162
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,360
Speaker 0: sometimes I think I might have bought like initial D number one there and stuff like that.

163
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,180
Speaker 0: But they had a comic rack in the borders.

164
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,232
Speaker 0: It was like a bigger than usual comic rack for borders is.

165
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:39,875
Speaker 0: and on that comic rack I at one point when I was looking at the magazines I happen to notice ghost in the shell - man-machine interface issue number one.

166
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:40,876
Speaker 0: I said, holy shit.

167
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,179
Speaker 0: Look at that It's I got it and I went back the next month and got number two.

168
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,020
Speaker 0: I don't like the next month again number three.

169
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,688
Speaker 0: And then eventually my friend Ian got me going to the conflict store again And now I have boxes coming every month.

170
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,198
Speaker 1: No, uh, thank you Shiro.

171
00:08:56,358 --> 00:09:04,680
Speaker 1: I avoid reading that partly just because I hate issues like I. Comic books are so unpleasant to read that I just can't deal with it.

172
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:08,819
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get some sort of compilation or trade or I'm just not gonna bother.

173
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,663
Speaker 1: there is No, what if?

174
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:13,720
Speaker 0: what if I took like all the issues right and I bound them together into a single book?

175
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,156
Speaker 1: It's still that big floppy paper.

176
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:22,080
Speaker 0: If it was quality binding maybe but now actually for ghost in the shell - I kind of like the issue.

177
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,920
Speaker 0: I don't like the separation of the issues into the separate, you know things.

178
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,040
Speaker 0: I like it all to be together.

179
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,612
Speaker 0: But the bigger Pages really helped that manga because a lot of little things in it.

180
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,400
Speaker 1: I didn't feel like I missed anything.

181
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:34,367
Speaker 0: No, you probably didn't.

182
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,819
Speaker 1: but well anyway, here's the deal.

183
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,160
Speaker 1: Scott's been trying to get me to read this forever.

184
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:39,906
Speaker 1: It's been in the pile along with.

185
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,775
Speaker 0: it goes in the shell - goes in the shell.

186
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,940
Speaker 0: one epic must reads.

187
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,952
Speaker 0: It goes in the shell - it's got to be epic must read right now.

188
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,860
Speaker 1: Scott would never say anything beyond.

189
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to read this.

190
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:56,654
Speaker 0: Well, I would say a few things like we'd be watching say stand Solid state society and you're like, oh this is this.

191
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,759
Speaker 1: is this happens in that?

192
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,713
Speaker 0: well No I say wow this reminds me a lot more of goes in the shell - that it reminds me of.

193
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,256
Speaker 0: goes in the shell.

194
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:16,684
Speaker 0: one like it goes In the shell - it's a lot more hacking stuff and it's always with you know The big circles and the gates and all that stuff and the sort of they use those same visuals in some of the later Set in standalone complex second gig and in Solid state society.

195
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:21,060
Speaker 0: So when those visuals came up I'd be like, ah, this is a lot like goes in the shell - man.

196
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,626
Speaker 1: So I finally read it.

197
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:24,669
Speaker 0: you like that tanuki.

198
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,180
Speaker 1: right the two key was those was arguably the best part.

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,873
Speaker 1: That's nuki Andy of the wolf spirit the way that was drawn.

200
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:31,737
Speaker 1: I thought was really cool.

201
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,380
Speaker 0: That's okay.

202
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:37,455
Speaker 1: Beyond that I mean I enjoyed it, but I read it and I felt like all right.

203
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,056
Speaker 1: I'm reading this.

204
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:46,044
Speaker 1: I'm reading this I I know what's going on and I got to the end and then I thought back and I realized that I had no fucking Idea what had happened.

205
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,475
Speaker 0: that entire goddamn mong explain the plot to me.

206
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:49,399
Speaker 1: You know what?

207
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:53,231
Speaker 1: Uh, so so a bunch of pigs died, right?

208
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,193
Speaker 0: What were the pigs doing?

209
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,096
Speaker 0: Why were they special?

210
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:59,088
Speaker 1: Well, uh Arguably, they're being used for some nefarious purposes.

211
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,115
Speaker 1: But who by who?

212
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,840
Speaker 0: well, what were they supposed to be used for?

213
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,751
Speaker 0: Organs and what were they being used?

214
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,240
Speaker 1: brains but not organ.

215
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,608
Speaker 1: That is so not the plot.

216
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,339
Speaker 1: No, but but I I don't.

217
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:20,748
Speaker 1: There's a point at which I could have just stopped reading and I would have had the same understanding of the manga As if I'd continued reading.

218
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,280
Speaker 1: I got to the end and realized that the second half of the manga.

219
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:28,093
Speaker 1: Not only did I not know what happened, but I suddenly realized like wait a minute.

220
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:30,920
Speaker 1: No, her name is Kusanagi not Aramaki.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,345
Speaker 1: Why didn't I notice that before then?

222
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,208
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, wait a minute.

223
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,296
Speaker 1: Well, what the god damn it?

224
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:42,307
Speaker 1: It's one of those things Shiro I Defy you to tell me what the fuck happened.

225
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:51,019
Speaker 0: and ghost in the shell - I can actually sort of piece it together But you know how many times I've read it Seven more than four at least.

226
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:56,728
Speaker 1: The thing is basically I got to the end and I'm like, wow That was really profound.

227
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:04,440
Speaker 1: and then I realized that everything I was thinking about that was profound Was not something that I'd read in the manga but something I was thinking about because of ghost in the shell.

228
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:14,860
Speaker 0: I think the thing about ghost in the shell - man-machine interface the manga right because well, I guess it's only a manga is that There is a plot a literal plot.

229
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:21,720
Speaker 0: You can get it by reading extra carefully and extra slowly and extra and multiple times and extra painfully.

230
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,511
Speaker 0: But that plot is not really the point and it doesn't matter.

231
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,821
Speaker 1: I think I think the point of ghost in the shell - What?

232
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,066
Speaker 1: well there are a lot of points.

233
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:44,987
Speaker 1: I think basically it was Shiro just Kind of getting his mind on the paper and ghost in the shell just happened to be the way he was doing that Yeah, and it was basically just him thinking about Well, what if this and what if this?

234
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:48,800
Speaker 1: you know kind of like speculative fiction but at the same time Shiro-tastic.

235
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:56,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically each page each scene each you know action is just something to like.

236
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,665
Speaker 0: work your brain and The plot suffers.

237
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:06,700
Speaker 0: the coherency of the plot suffers as a result of extreme imagery.

238
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:16,339
Speaker 1: Yes I mean there is a point at which I think she was in a game but maybe not and I pretty much lost track of Plot from that point on yeah, and she switches into like using like D cots.

239
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:25,591
Speaker 1: fine with the D cots until I couldn't figure out if she was in a D cot or in the real world or Or if the D cot was in the real

240
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:30,880
Speaker 0: and maybe the point is to get your brain to do that Or maybe it's just Shiro and he's just a crazy nut job.

241
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,240
Speaker 1: Yeah

242
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,865
Speaker 0: I mean or maybe both

243
00:13:33,166 --> 00:14:03,758
Speaker 1: my real idea is that one of the ideas Shiro was trying to get across is that the world that The entity that is arguably known as the major What lives in now and exists in is so utterly different and so much faster paced than the real world that like Every now and then it kind of cuts out of following the main character around and just shows you like humans Doing things and the humans are a lot like the humans are moving so slowly and doing so little compared to what she does in like two minutes.

244
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,643
Speaker 1: that Beyond that.

245
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:13,837
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened something with a tree at the end and something I don't even know who was hacking the pigs if there even were any thugs.

246
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,704
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, something like that.

247
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:17,948
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't get it.

248
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,453
Speaker 1: I suggest you read it.

249
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:21,280
Speaker 1: However, you read it again.

250
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,274
Speaker 1: Maybe I think what really got me about it.

251
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,040
Speaker 1: I mean I enjoyed it.

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,679
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong, but the fact that Shiro has footnotes and it's not like.

253
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,700
Speaker 1: well Here's a footnote to explain this and here's the footnote.

254
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:39,792
Speaker 0: There's one footnote because early in the manga there's like these two flying machines, right and he basically puts a footnote like yeah I know these flying machines are impossible because of blah.

255
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:41,358
Speaker 0: I just drew them this way cuz it's better.

256
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:47,355
Speaker 0: Sorry It's like what you're talking about what's possible and impossible in your made-up future.

257
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,000
Speaker 1: Oh, he goes well beyond that.

258
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:59,360
Speaker 1: I think my favorite footnote is on a random page and I Swear to you that this footnote has nothing to do with what is happening on that page or any page anywhere near it.

259
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:02,770
Speaker 1: He just has a random footnote talking about how the u.s.

260
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,074
Speaker 1: Is upgrading its military.

261
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:05,659
Speaker 1: Now, maybe Japan should do the same.

262
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:12,108
Speaker 1: Yeah military fanboy for sure Shiro, I gotta hand it to you man.

263
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:13,252
Speaker 1: That was some.

264
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,199
Speaker 1: that was some epic manga right there.

265
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:23,337
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so when someone says shirotastic and you're not quite sure with it that mean I think ghost in the shell.

266
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,682
Speaker 1: the second manga Epitomizes.

267
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:26,504
Speaker 1: now sure.

268
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:28,950
Speaker 1: I think it is the second most shirotastic.

269
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:32,740
Speaker 0: if I'm to understand correctly Orion is the most shirotastic.

270
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,354
Speaker 1: Well, I have never in any way engaged with Orion nor have I but I know better.

271
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:48,497
Speaker 1: so as far as I have experienced the As far as someone who would even consider anything Shiro believes to be a valid philosophy could believe to be true.

272
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:52,409
Speaker 1: Ah That was the most shirotastic thing I've ever witnessed.

273
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,312
Speaker 0: All right, you ready?

274
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:54,556
Speaker 1: I think we're ready.

275
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:56,959
Speaker 1: That's that I could come up with tonight.

276
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,503
Speaker 0: I was uh, I was just you know Looking around cuz.

277
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:08,208
Speaker 0: I've been watching the galaxy Express 3 9 TV show recently because some someone's fansubbing it so nicely But their fansub me too slowly.

278
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:09,294
Speaker 1: Well Scott has this thing.

279
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,383
Speaker 1: It's like whenever he's tired Like my.

280
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,547
Speaker 1: when I'm tired, I go to bed.

281
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,313
Speaker 1: Maybe I masturbate or something.

282
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:20,792
Speaker 1: I don't know but when Scott's tired He'll put on some leji Matsumoto like old melodramatic side.

283
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:30,760
Speaker 0: lady Matsumoto's anime are Amazing all of them, but they only work When it's dark and when it's late at night and when it's quiet.

284
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:38,250
Speaker 0: That's the only time they work and then when it when that's true, they work Amazing if you're Scott and if you're tired, they work even better.

285
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,620
Speaker 1: I think you're confusing lady Matsumoto with space ghost.

286
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:47,000
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of what it was is when I was you know young and I first discovered lady Matsumoto, right?

287
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:48,579
Speaker 0: It was on the sci-fi channel.

288
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,594
Speaker 0: It was late at night on anime week on the sci-fi channel and

289
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,700
Speaker 1: you watched galaxy

290
00:16:53,262 --> 00:17:03,039
Speaker 0: Galaxy Express 3 9 movie dubbed and then the second Galaxy Express 3 9 movie the next day also dubbed late at night in the dark and the couch in my living room alone and that's sort of.

291
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,240
Speaker 0: It really worked on me.

292
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,089
Speaker 0: That was like more than any of the.

293
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:19,536
Speaker 0: that was like really when I started Super animating that week of anime right because it was like Fatal Fury Fatal Fury 2 Galaxy Express Galaxy Express 2 and then something else shitty that I remember Sean or something.

294
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:24,740
Speaker 0: I don't remember a son terror No, I think was actually only four days because then I think Godzilla started which is also awesome.

295
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,144
Speaker 0: By the way, Godzilla vs.

296
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,849
Speaker 0: Mothra is the best Godzilla movie.

297
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,073
Speaker 0: hands down hands down.

298
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:30,397
Speaker 0: No one can say anything else.

299
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,180
Speaker 0: You're all wrong.

300
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,520
Speaker 1: Well, I think it comes down to the fact that my Mothra edge like 10 to the score of any Godzilla.

301
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:46,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, and while well, well Ghidorah is the best of all the monsters, you know in coolness and lookingness Cuz he's like a hydra with three heads Mothra is still better.

302
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,779
Speaker 0: So whatever anyway.

303
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:55,916
Speaker 0: So, you know that was that was my experience with that and that more than any other anime I watched that week was like the double awesomes.

304
00:17:56,358 --> 00:18:06,533
Speaker 0: So Every time I watch even other leiji Matsumoto things like harlocks and things like that I always try to go for the same feeling and it always works.

305
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:07,456
Speaker 0: I don't know.

306
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,540
Speaker 0: it always works on me.

307
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,163
Speaker 0: It's always great.

308
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:18,100
Speaker 1: The result is whenever we have the crew over we're ready to you know, the nights winding down We're about to maybe all retire for the evening or maybe play one last game of something.

309
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:26,375
Speaker 1: Scott always suggests that we watch some sort of not necessarily leiji Matsumoto But I think pretty much either that or a night on the galactic railroad.

310
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,812
Speaker 0: It was Dying like to grow Galaxy Express.

311
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:30,697
Speaker 0: There's a link.

312
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:35,140
Speaker 1: Yes The problem is one of them is good one of those boring.

313
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:38,960
Speaker 0: Well, he based the Galaxy Express off of the you know.

314
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,740
Speaker 0: Well his idea to have trains in space was because of the novel of nine the Galactica.

315
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,468
Speaker 1: But anyway, oh, yeah, I'm not.

316
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,740
Speaker 1: I mean I just that movie is so boring.

317
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:50,819
Speaker 0: Anyway, so watching anime again, right cuz I'm watching Galaxy Express TV show.

318
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:56,640
Speaker 0: I realized I can watch like five plus anime episodes a day if I watch them on the train.

319
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,475
Speaker 0: So I was thinking hey, I'm gonna actually go back now.

320
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,951
Speaker 0: I'm gonna watch that Ava I'm gonna do it and then I'm gonna watch that eska flown.

321
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,820
Speaker 0: a I'm gonna do it and we're gonna make the show, right?

322
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,220
Speaker 1: I've been waiting for this day for a long time because I'm itching to talk about eska flown.

323
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,551
Speaker 1: That's still to this day one of my top three.

324
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,360
Speaker 1: That is one of the best anime ever made, right?

325
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,320
Speaker 0: So we're gonna do those right as soon as I get her out.

326
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're only 26 episodes so I could probably watch them in a week.

327
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:20,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

328
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:25,754
Speaker 0: So anyway Realizing that I said hey, I gotta watch the cowboy bebop.

329
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:26,940
Speaker 0: I've seen it like five times.

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,065
Speaker 0: I get to see it seven times.

331
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:33,067
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I wonder if I can buy it and You know, it was available first.

332
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:35,114
Speaker 0: They made it available on the original DVDs.

333
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:48,017
Speaker 0: Well VHS then DVDs The VHS is are mad expensive because like two episodes of tape The DVDs are mad expensive You know because there were a whole bunch of them and the box set was like a hundred something dollars.

334
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:49,829
Speaker 0: and today if you want That original box set.

Speaker 0: Then they came out with like these best sessions Which was like a little set that had like the best the quote best episodes or the most important episode.

337
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,600
Speaker 1: That seems really kind of silly though, cuz you got to watch cowboy bebop all the way through it.

338
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,460
Speaker 0: All right, I had like the most process everything.

339

Speaker 0: that is the great.

349
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:50,720
Speaker 0: I will go farther than that.

350
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,924
Speaker 0: I will say that is the greatest value you could possibly get in anime ever Ever existed.

351
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:58,846
Speaker 1: not necessarily.

352
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:04,020
Speaker 1: However in all of entertainment because I we paid 50 cents to see the powerpuff girls movie.

353
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:14,062
Speaker 0: Yes, but this is the best dollar per awesome You can get in terms of purchasing anime on DVDs that has ever existed in the history of the world and probably will for quite Some time.

354
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:17,760
Speaker 0: I mean if you let you know someone gives you something like, you know for free.

355
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:21,060
Speaker 0: But we're talking about like a you know a deal at a store not a deal.

356
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:25,120
Speaker 1: What not that that epic box set that we saw for sale.

357
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:29,210
Speaker 0: So, you know this got me thinking right you look cowboy bebop.

358
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,955
Speaker 0: anime is you know bandai?

359
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,420
Speaker 0: I guess is bandai entertainment, right?

360
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,659
Speaker 0: They're doing anime legends.

361
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:39,200
Speaker 0: So that must be their new sort of like labeling of their awesome box sets and things like that.

362
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,762
Speaker 0: You know of the?

363
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:43,980
Speaker 0: let's take old anime re-release them on new DVDs and sell them for less money.

364
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,280
Speaker 0: They're gonna call it anime legends.

365
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:52,032
Speaker 0: So I go to write stuff and I search for anime legends and I got a whole bunch of stuff But I don't care about most of it because some of it's not.

366
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:52,334
Speaker 0: you know.

367
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:53,680
Speaker 0: box set some of its other things.

368
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:55,375
Speaker 0: So I'm looking for the thin pack collection.

369
00:21:55,415 --> 00:22:00,114
Speaker 0: So I type in You know anime legends complete collection.

370
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:01,380
Speaker 0: you ready for the list here?

371
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:04,538
Speaker 0: These are all excellent values in anime that I recommend.

372
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:07,524
Speaker 0: ready Agent Aika, no, I don't recommend that.

373
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:08,405
Speaker 0: our Joe.

374
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:09,467
Speaker 0: I know I don't recommend that either.

375
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:09,928
Speaker 0: Here we go.

376
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:15,093
Speaker 0: big Oh $36, oh man, but that's just season one.

377
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:16,760
Speaker 0: It's $36 also for season two.

378
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,623
Speaker 1: They're both worth it.

379
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:20,434
Speaker 1: Big O one is one of the better giant robot shows ever.

380
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:21,137
Speaker 0: That's not too.

381
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:22,020
Speaker 1: is Ava done better?

382
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,300
Speaker 0: That's not a very good value because you're paying as much as you are for 26 episodes of cowboy bebop for 13 episodes of big.

383
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:33,128
Speaker 0: Oh, but big I was so good Then this is probably still the cheapest way to get it.

384
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,538
Speaker 0: if you can't get the old bricks so big.

385
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:43,507
Speaker 0: Oh Blue sub 6 complete collection not bad crest of the stars Eska flown a $45 that is well worth it.

386
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:44,249
Speaker 0: Check this out.

387
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:55,381
Speaker 0: This pisses me off because I bought this individually just by disc Gundam seed The first 25 episodes for $45 and then the second 25 episodes for $38.

388
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:57,708
Speaker 1: I want to say one thing real quick about Gundam seed.

389
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:59,514
Speaker 1: if you don't like Gundam shows.

390
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:00,236
Speaker 1: Well one you're.

391
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:01,139
Speaker 1: I hate you.

392
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,767
Speaker 1: but if you know if you haven't seen a Gundam show before or if you just don't think you like Gundam shows or Prejudice

393
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:20,019
Speaker 0: to get or you have misconceptions if you've never watched one and you have some sort of prejudice about what you think they're like or if you've seen one and Maybe you saw the wrong one a G Gundam and you had you know.

394
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,347
Speaker 0: you think you know what they're like.

395
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:29,167
Speaker 0: and if you haven't seen Gundam seed or You haven't watched like Zeta Gundam or the original Gundam You really don't know Gundam.

396
00:23:29,187 --> 00:23:33,535
Speaker 0: a lot of you will think they know it and don't like it or think they know it and do like It but they really don't know it.

397
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:34,824
Speaker 0: Buy this.

398

Speaker 0: Well, there's one bad one and two good ones.

439
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,894
Speaker 0: See, let's do the bad one.

440
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,440
Speaker 1: Alright, we can get this done quick.

441
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,849
Speaker 1: There's this show is called persona hyphen Trinity soul.

442
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:49,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the only good thing about this show is that our favorite voice actor in the known universe.

443
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,770
Speaker 0: Takehito koyasu plays one of the care of me somewhat major characters so off his game.

444
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, he doesn't sound like when he.

445
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:58,345
Speaker 0: when he first talked I was like.

446
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:01,837
Speaker 0: that sounds like koyasu But I was like, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

447
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:06,110
Speaker 0: it sounds like a type koyasu imitator, but no, it's really him.

448
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,067
Speaker 0: So he must be off his game.

449
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:09,413
Speaker 0: now There's something not right.

450
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:19,644
Speaker 1: shows being directed by some guy who is known for jack all great and Honestly, the show is pretty bad, but it's not bad enough to make fun of.

451
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,190
Speaker 1: it's just really not entertaining.

452
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:28,394
Speaker 1: The only thing it's got going is that basically the plot as far as you can tell from the first episode is People have souls.

453
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:34,370
Speaker 1: those souls are also giant robots and people have psychic giant robot battles and that's it.

454
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:36,390
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all that's going on in the show.

455
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:46,381
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like these two siblings and like they don't have a home and they have to go back to live with their brother or Something and I think this lives kind of exemplifies everything.

456
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:57,630
Speaker 1: that's wrong with a lot of anime that comes out these days because this show Reminds me a lot of several other shows I've watched in recent memory where the first episode like the character designs are kind of generic.

457
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,069
Speaker 1: The animation is kind of sterile and boring.

458
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:09,830
Speaker 1: They always introduce characters and give all this stuff about him, but they also introduce some central mystery And they pretty much ignore that mystery or don't tell you enough to know anything about it.

459
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:16,909
Speaker 1: but they also want to give you enough to care about the characters and They kind of jump in the middle of something that you don't care about and they don't go anywhere with.

460
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,110
Speaker 0: yeah I think the primary problem with the show is that they toss you into it, right?

461
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:43,450
Speaker 0: They first and you know It's at the classic anime first beginning of the first episode thing where they show you Some mysterious like government or military group doing something mysterious and then a strange event occurring or something like that And then they cut and they give you the opener and then they throw you to the main characters and then you know that whatever They're get whatever is gonna happen to them is gonna relate to that mysterious thing.

462
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:51,951
Speaker 1: They showed you 30 seconds of the beginning and apparently the plot involves of people being turned inside out by something called Reverse.

463
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:58,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just this show does not look like it has any potential to be in any way entertaining.

464
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:05,270
Speaker 0: It's so boring, I think pretty much the major problem with the show is that there's no reason to care about anything.

465
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:06,949
Speaker 0: It's like people are being reversed.

466
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:09,399
Speaker 1: Okay, I still crack up.

467
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,047
Speaker 0: It's not even like, you know, huh?

468
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,562
Speaker 0: There's some clues and now I can start thinking about a mystery.

469
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:18,361
Speaker 0: It's like no just people are being reversed Alright, and I'm supposed to wonder about why.

470
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:25,209
Speaker 1: just pretty much from that alone Every conversation the character has just goes nowhere and you don't care and it they always refer.

471
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:25,490
Speaker 0: no one.

472
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,661
Speaker 0: I think it's another problem.

473
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:27,629
Speaker 0: a lot of anime do this.

474
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:30,592
Speaker 0: No one has any direct Conversations.

475
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:34,146
Speaker 0: everyone just sort of thinks a lot of things but no one says anything to anyone.

476
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:39,926
Speaker 0: people just kind of look at each Other and then walk around and they say things like offhand comments that reference things.

477
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:47,890
Speaker 0: We don't know about like brother If only blah or that guy blah blah blah, which guy you talking about?

478
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:55,181
Speaker 0: you're purposely saying that guy so we don't know which guy you're talking about, you know, and This just it's not where it was.

479
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,827
Speaker 0: just the first episode is so painful.

480
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:57,609
Speaker 0: I couldn't continue.

481
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,196
Speaker 0: go I think the music was okay though.

482
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the opener didn't really fit.

483
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,850
Speaker 1: It was one of those generic openers.

484
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:03,970
Speaker 1: It's just the show's got nothing.

485
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:11,630
Speaker 0: No You can skip persona Trinity soul even though it's kind of sad because it's one of the few shows I've seen in recent years.

486
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,573
Speaker 0: It's like the.

487
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:16,990
Speaker 0: the percentage of moe shows to non moe shows is getting pretty off.

488
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,630
Speaker 0: There's a lot more moe shows going on or at least shows with moe elements if not full-on moe moe shows.

489
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:27,242
Speaker 0: And it's kind of sad that one of the non moe shows is shitty.

490
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:29,248
Speaker 1: So don't even bother with this show.

491
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:30,455
Speaker 0: It's not good Yep, skip it.

492
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,090
Speaker 1: So, uh There's another show we checked out and this one has a lot of promise.

493
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,350
Speaker 1: However, you have to be a certain kind of anime fan to enjoy a show like that.

494
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,950
Speaker 0: You have to be in the right situation in the right mood to enjoy the show.

495
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:50,398
Speaker 0: This show's actually from 2007 and it was ran from April to September 24 episodes so Lovely complex.

496
00:29:50,860 --> 00:30:01,098
Speaker 0: that might sound like a bad moe Show, maybe a harem show of some sort something like that, but it's actually One of those cute funny shows.

497
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:03,446
Speaker 0: there aren't too many shows in this category.

498
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:13,858
Speaker 0: It's sort of like karakano Sort of like koto-cha in there sort of like koto-cha sort of like Haniori Dango, it's one of those sort of shows.

499
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:19,790
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a comedic high school shoujo thing and It's really not too bad.

500
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:32,698
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not something I would go out and watch a whole lot of you know, like diligently But if I'm in sort of a silly mood and I need me some laughs or maybe I'm an anime club And I want to get everyone riled up.

501
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:37,130
Speaker 1: This is the medicine, you know There hasn't been a show like this in a long time.

502
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:44,149
Speaker 1: This show fills the koto-cha hole because if you want that kind of show You got to go to the old stuff or you can come to this show right here.

503
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:50,964
Speaker 1: There's there's definitely there's a lot of uh, Mon's Eye going on Which I'm a big fan a big fan of that Mon's Eye action.

504
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,110
Speaker 1: The plot is pretty simple.

505
00:30:52,130 --> 00:31:00,690
Speaker 1: There's a there's a girl who is really tall and there's a guy who's really short and they hate each other But they have a lot in common.

506
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,975
Speaker 0: They have a hell of a lot in common but and they're sort of like.

507
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:11,527
Speaker 0: they're sort of like friends and enemies at the same time like to hang out with each other and You know, they team up but also they hate each other.

508
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:20,081
Speaker 0: and so like Right, and you can tell that they that you know, they're supposed to end up together But it's like something they wouldn't even think of.

509
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,450
Speaker 0: you know, it's it's it's one of those kind of situations.

510
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,890
Speaker 0: It's sort of a cliche situation and it's a little obvious.

511
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:37,150
Speaker 0: Right and and what's gonna happen in the episodes is always sort of obvious because the shallow High school comedic romance plot more heavy on the comedy than on the romance, you know That's not the point.

512
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:53,489
Speaker 0: the point is that the jokes that are actually go on during the show are actually kind of funny and endearing and it's like oh but then it's like lol's epic lol's and They actually kind of act like normal people and they make real-world kind of jokes and it's just silly and fun.

513
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:58,930
Speaker 0: And then occasionally, you know, there's crazy slapstick stuff to like people getting hit over the head.

514
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely a child's toy kind of vibe going on there.

515
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,770
Speaker 1: Also the main character kind of reminds me of waka ba.

516
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:09,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda only much more Gruff and maybe a little consign.

517
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe a little bit.

518
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:15,210
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't even realize this is directed by a konosuke Uda.

519
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:15,973
Speaker 0: Who's that?

520
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,290
Speaker 1: He also directed Galaxy Express 999 internal fantasy.

521
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,474
Speaker 0: That's yeah, that's not.

522
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:27,914
Speaker 1: and the Sailor Moon super s movie clearly the best of the Sailor Moon movies my best I mean worst.

523
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:31,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the show has some other stuff going on in it, too.

524
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,610
Speaker 0: You know, there's there's like, you know some school stuff.

525
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,109
Speaker 0: They actually pay attention to what's going on in school a little bit.

526
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,551
Speaker 0: you know.

527
00:32:36,591 --> 00:32:48,088
Speaker 1: what really makes the show stand out is kind of it's the opposite of persona Trinity soul and that The character designs have character and just the way they talk and interact and the way everything's done.

528
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,194
Speaker 1: There's There's enough going on.

529
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:55,289
Speaker 1: that gives the show charm that just some of these other newer kind of sterile shows just don't have.

530
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:00,148
Speaker 0: yes Definitely it is the exact opposite of persona Trinity soul in a way because it doesn't really have much of a plot.

531
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:07,170
Speaker 0: to speak of The episode we watched, you know a couple episodes we watched the what was gonna happen was so contrived cliche and obvious.

532
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,581
Speaker 0: It might as well nothing might as well have happened But you know it the characters you care about them.

533
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,410
Speaker 0: Each character is really characterized.

534
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:23,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you and they interact with each other and interesting or you know At least funny ways quite often.

535
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:24,501
Speaker 0: that's pretty much the whole show.

536
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:25,585
Speaker 1: and the show is really.

537
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:27,130
Speaker 1: it's stylized.

538
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:32,630
Speaker 1: The way it's drawn and the way everything is put together is it stands out from all the other anime coming out lately.

539
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, well at least there's a lot of bright colors so we can kind of hurt your eyes sometimes.

540
00:33:36,672 --> 00:33:39,604
Speaker 0: But other than that, you know, it's not those moe colors though.

541
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:44,462
Speaker 1: It's actual bright colors Yep, not those like faded moe girl hair color, whatever.

542
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:50,490
Speaker 0: No, no, it's actually bright colors Like, you know super gals kinda that kind of color.

543
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:51,414
Speaker 1: now.

544
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:56,940
Speaker 1: last and certainly not least a lot of people have been talking about this show and I Was a little leery.

545
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,570
Speaker 0: but I was also a little bit leery.

546
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:06,564
Speaker 1: I heard enough good buzz and especially once I heard what the plot nominally was I actually I kind of am excited about seeing more of this show maybe.

547
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:14,370
Speaker 0: so the show is called Spice and wolf right and at first I was like, uh-oh This is gonna be a not a furry show for furries, right?

548
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:26,730
Speaker 0: because the picture you see when you look for this show is like a girl with ears and a tail and You think there's gonna be big-time moe furry action, that's what I expected to see but we watch it anyway.

549
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:32,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically I expected it to be Uto are they do mono - And he wasn't.

550
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:33,012
Speaker 1: well the thing is.

551
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:45,041
Speaker 1: then I was told the plot and it seems like it's it's definitely said in a European Middle Ages kind of you know monotheism is kind of making its rounds and the old gods are being forgotten.

552
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:48,034
Speaker 0: and this this will is the plot of the the final.

553
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:52,963
Speaker 0: well the Final finished chapter of Phoenix the same plot something like that.

554
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:56,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically this wolf goddess is Her time has passed.

555
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,389
Speaker 1: She the people no longer need her.

556
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:03,446
Speaker 1: so she is going to leave and travel to the lands in the north and she needs help.

557
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:10,209
Speaker 1: so she kind of Shanghai's this poor merchant who's just passing through town into taking her north.

558
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:14,250
Speaker 1: Yep, and I'm not sure exactly where they're gonna go with this.

559
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:23,217
Speaker 1: I've only seen one episode but this show if they go in any of the directions that I think it might go in and there's two or three directions it could Go in where I would be pleased.

560
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,290
Speaker 1: The show is actually got a lot of potential.

561
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:26,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

562
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:36,750
Speaker 0: The only thing this I don't like the show 100% I mean, I really that merchant main character guy I really kind of don't like him so much like he seems kind of glad.

563
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:41,326
Speaker 0: I wish he was more like when I first saw him like I imagined.

564
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,310
Speaker 0: I guess this might be a problem.

565
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:52,289
Speaker 0: Imagine him being a lot like ginkgo from mushishi because he kind of looks like him Kind of looks like him a little bit and if he was like that kind of character I think the show would be a lot more awesome, you know.

566
00:35:52,390 --> 00:36:00,030
Speaker 0: But he seems kind of just like a normal kind of merchant Like he's just like a normal average dude and the way he acts is sort of bland.

567
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,157
Speaker 0: I really don't care about him that much.

568
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:07,799
Speaker 0: but other than that like what goes on in the show and the plot and the style Is all really high quality.

569
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:17,162
Speaker 1: See I like him partly because the way You know, they're whenever there's this sort of alright There's a magical girl something and she meets a guy and the kind of.

570
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:20,270
Speaker 1: there's the trope of how that would play out in anime.

571
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:21,765
Speaker 1: You can see what's gonna happen.

572
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,108
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

573
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:23,990
Speaker 1: And in this show doesn't really turn out that way.

574
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:30,490
Speaker 1: He reacts more like a reasonable person would react and she reacts in a completely unexpected way.

575
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:34,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that's because you know the way they've made the main character guy.

576
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:34,930
Speaker 0: What's his name?

577
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,595
Speaker 0: Craft Lawrence craft Lawrence.

578
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:41,007
Speaker 0: the way craft Lawrence is is he's such a normal merchant.

579
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:42,050
Speaker 0: He's just like hey, what's up?

580
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,674
Speaker 0: I'm a merchant.

581
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:43,097
Speaker 0: How you doing?

582
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,770
Speaker 1: He talks and he's got his own drama.

583
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,016
Speaker 1: There's a girl who likes him But he has problems with that.

584
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:52,550
Speaker 1: cuz she's kind of young and blah blah blah blah blah, and he's got his business to take care of.

585
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:56,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean he sees this like wolf God and he's like you're not a wolf God prove.

586
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:57,350
Speaker 0: You're the wolf God.

587
00:36:57,652 --> 00:36:59,184
Speaker 0: Oh shit, you proved the wolf God.

588
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:01,359
Speaker 1: Oh my god see, I think that's the point.

589
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:06,907
Speaker 1: that pushed the show over the line because The show was you know serious, but that was the funniest joke in the whole show.

590
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,057
Speaker 1: Oh my god There's there's a there's a little.

591
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:11,830
Speaker 0: it's not a comedy show, but that was a funny bit.

592
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:13,278
Speaker 1: It was it was more of.

593
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:19,509
Speaker 1: it was one of those kind of Jokes that is in the context of the show like a character makes a joke.

594
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,138
Speaker 0: It was sort of an Admiral Pelle.

595
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:23,450
Speaker 0: you joke if you will it very much was a Pelle.

596
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,619
Speaker 1: You're like, oh you think that's a good idea.

597
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,964
Speaker 1: You really think that's a good.

598
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:27,807
Speaker 1: Well, you're right.

599
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:28,450
Speaker 1: It is a good idea.

600
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:34,670
Speaker 0: No But basically this is part where he's like well, you know prove you're the wolf God.

601
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,141
Speaker 0: She's like oh you want me to transform into my real form.

602
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,070
Speaker 1: and he's like yes transform into your real.

603
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,571
Speaker 0: He's like.

604
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:40,755
Speaker 0: are you sure he's like?

605
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:41,116
Speaker 0: yes.

606
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:41,457
Speaker 0: Well.

607
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:42,921
Speaker 0: Are you sure no matter what?

608
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,202
Speaker 0: yes?

609
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,489
Speaker 0: I'm sure 100% no matter what she's like.

610
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:47,534
Speaker 1: well Transforming like that.

611
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:48,979
Speaker 1: There's always a cost.

612
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,926
Speaker 1: I have to enact a price in order to do that.

613
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:52,637
Speaker 1: He's like all right What's the price?

614
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:53,888
Speaker 1: and she's like blood?

615
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,783
Speaker 1: Um Before he's like ah and then she's like or a very small amount of wheats.

616
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:01,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like.

617
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,175
Speaker 0: oh use the week You sure?

618
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,349
Speaker 0: yes, yes, please use the wheat.

619
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:30,682
Speaker 1: The show is I guess the the reason I think these two shows regardless of how good they might end up actually being or not being that Lovely complex and spice and wolf as opposed to the vast majority of the new anime out there that I've seen in the last few years They don't fall into the stereotypes immediately and The characters and the designs and just the way they play out.

620
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:44,450
Speaker 1: or they have heart they have they have charm they have something a little bit fresh and Shows like persona Trinity are just so sterile and boring and bland and not boring in the good way like gassaraki but boring in the bad way like persona Trinity.

621
00:38:44,751 --> 00:38:46,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean lovely complex.

622
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:58,630
Speaker 0: I care about the characters and if spice and wolf I really care about the plot That's going on there, and you know I guess I care about the characters a little bit in spice and wolf And the plot of lovely complex not at all because there isn't one.

623
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:04,530
Speaker 1: But the only problem with spice and wolf is that she totally looks like a fox and not a wolf But that's for sure.

624
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:13,109
Speaker 1: I think that's just because of the coloring because she's a she's a wolf goddess But she's the protector of the harvest so she's kind of supposed to be wheat grain that sort of thing.

625
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:13,390
Speaker 1: yeah.

626
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:26,129
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, these aren't like the best shows ever by any means, but if you're looking for the new animes Is two that you know can serve two different purposes one for the serious kind of anime watching times and one for the?

627
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,605
Speaker 0: Hilarious slapstick anime watching time you know what.

628
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:34,100
Speaker 0: and one for the never One for the torturing your friends with incredibly boring anime time.

629
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:45,544
Speaker 1: or if you have bad taste or if you have bad taste or if you Really really have already seen every show that involves things that may or may not be robot like fighting because this is another one of those generic shows.

630
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:50,307
Speaker 0: yeah I guess if you like if if if the show can be terrible and absolutely everybody.

631
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:55,650
Speaker 0: a show can be terrible But like robots is enough for you, then psychic robots and for some eternity souls.

632
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:02,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a show where the main character obviously has the special extra robot, which is a sword.

633
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:07,108
Speaker 1: Yes, because the sword is always better than a gun Beats everything don't you know that?

634
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,318
Speaker 1: But these other two shows Particularly spice and wolf.

635
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,100
Speaker 1: if you it's the same level of scrap princess I would say I say pretty much exactly.

636
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,970
Speaker 0: spice and wolf and scrap princess are like right in line like BAM.

637
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,744
Speaker 1: They're like a solid a-minus b-plus anime.

638
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:24,649
Speaker 0: There's something like that.

639
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,819
Speaker 0: They're the same kind of show same genre.

640
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:38,574
Speaker 1: you like one you like the other and also I will admit Horro the wolf goddess is really really freaking cute, but but and I really I think she is she's kind of normal anime girl Levels.

641
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:39,819
Speaker 1: well why I mean the years.

642
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:41,184
Speaker 1: I think the years make her cute.

643
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:42,469
Speaker 0: I think this is cuz you're furry.

644
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:44,253
Speaker 1: What can I say?

645
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:47,246
Speaker 1: I like fox ears and that sort of thing but what what?

646
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,190
Speaker 1: what makes her cute?

647
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,534
Speaker 1: Is that there you?

648
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:53,124
Speaker 1: I kind of expected this show to go in a bad moe kind of.

649
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:54,990
Speaker 1: protect me big brother.

650
00:40:55,515 --> 00:41:08,463
Speaker 1: you know that kind of show but the wolf goddess is is she acts the way you would expect a minor God or you know a deity to act and that She's kind of sarcastic and really powerful.

651
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,450
Speaker 0: yeah, she definitely doesn't take any crap.

652
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,378
Speaker 0: I do think that helps the show a lot.

653
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:25,857
Speaker 0: and what prevents me from being turned off by the girl with the ears in the Tail is that the girl with ears in the tail is the only person with ears in the tail and everyone else is normal and She doesn't act like some moe Whatever she acts like.

654
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,463
Speaker 0: you know the character should act it.

655
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:34,744
Speaker 1: Just you know ears in a tail throw I don't know Ephemeral or fairy or pixie like and in terms of temperament and that sort of thing.

656
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:41,750
Speaker 1: and I think that plus the fact that the Plot looks like it might go toward the lines of you know the old ways in the new way

657
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,358
Speaker 0: I definitely think the slide

658
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:43,580
Speaker 1: is

659
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:52,690
Speaker 0: definitely heading towards some sort of Medieval war feudalism kind of plot going on there historical something with a little bit of supernatural thrown on top there

660
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:53,835
Speaker 1: And that that's.

661
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:56,790
Speaker 1: I guess I've had an itch for that sort of thing for a long time.

662
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,730
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like the Pope versus some feudal lords with some magic on one side.

663
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,710
Speaker 1: I think that's why Claymore appealed to me so much when I first started.

664
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,272
Speaker 0: It's definitely.

665
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:08,703
Speaker 0: I think it's definitely got some Claymore ishness going on in there in the.

666
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:15,331
Speaker 0: in the way the medieval world is portrayed You know it's sort of like the way the towns and the villages of the normal people living in them There's.

667
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:19,970
Speaker 0: the people in the Claymore towns are more sad and the people who this place in Wolftown are happier.

668
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,450
Speaker 1: But if anything the Claymore universe as far as I can tell is basically the same as the universe in Simon's quest.

669
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,913
Speaker 1: Everything sucks.

670
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:30,908
Speaker 1: It's always dark and everywhere you go people die constantly.

671
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:31,590
Speaker 0: That's pretty accurate.

672
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course much like the Middle Ages We should.

673
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:37,849
Speaker 0: maybe when I Claymore comes out on DVD if it's not already we can watch that.

674
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:41,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to finish ergo proxy first because I really want to see the end of that.

675
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,151
Speaker 0: I don't know.

676
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,083
Speaker 0: did the out of business genie on ever finish?

677
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:46,930
Speaker 0: that were the mostly out of business genie on ever.

678
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,110
Speaker 1: I'm sure I will find a way to see the rest of that one way or another.

679
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:51,910
Speaker 0: I'm sure it can't be impossible.

680
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:57,675
Speaker 1: But yeah spice and wolf worth watching lovely complex worth watching persona Trinity Pretend it doesn't exist.

681
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:04,088
Speaker 1: I'm better off watch darker than black first because of those kinds of shows I think that one has more potential than this.

682
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we only watch like one or two episodes of that one and it has a lot more potential than this.

683
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:18,878
Speaker 1: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
