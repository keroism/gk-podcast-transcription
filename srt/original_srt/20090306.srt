1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:11,860
Speaker 1: We try not to think about the scariest one of all, the gigantic half-dragon, half-octopus, half-humanoid, great old one himself, Cthulhu, waiting to return from his city beneath the sea!

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:22,980
Speaker 1: Who day and night must slumber in relay, wave his tentacles, having nasty dreams, and who has the might as master of relay to drive humanity insane?

3
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:28,840
Speaker 1: Cthulhu, Cthulhu, tentacles!

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,400
Speaker 0: Cthulhu, Cthulhu, tentacles!

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,681
Speaker 0: Hello there.

6
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:48,140
Speaker 0: As I'm recording this, it is Thursday, and tomorrow the Watchmen movie, as I'm sure many people realize, will be in theaters all across the United States of America.

7
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:55,620
Speaker 0: And, you know, I haven't seen the movie yet, obviously, but I've read the book, you know, three, four, maybe even five times.

8
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:05,480
Speaker 0: And it is in the news, and it has become quite apparent to me, that there is something that has changed in the movie, having to do with the ending of the book.

9
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:11,700
Speaker 0: And I don't know what they changed it to, but it is common knowledge that something has been changed.

10
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:23,280
Speaker 0: And some people on the internet and other places are commenting, you know, "Oh, it's a good change," or "Oh, the change, you know, it works just as well," or some other such thing.

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,679
Speaker 0: Well, not knowing what they changed it to, I don't know if it works just as well.

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:35,660
Speaker 0: But I do have many reasons why I think that it must be what it was.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:47,020
Speaker 0: Now, I'm going to spoil Watchmen here, so if you have never read the book, you should probably stop listening right now, because it is one of the greatest graphic works of all time.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:57,060
Speaker 0: And having it ruined for you really, even if you don't think, you know, it's so great, or you don't care a lot about it, that's because you haven't read it yet.

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,825
Speaker 0: All right, so let's just get right down to it.

16
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:07,160
Speaker 0: At the end of Watchmen, right, Ozymandias releases his giant squid-like nasty monster.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,928
Speaker 0: People seem to call it the squid, right?

18
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,898
Speaker 0: It's not really a squid, but that's what they call it.

19
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,402
Speaker 0: On to New York.

20
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:21,440
Speaker 0: Thus, you know, he kills many, many people, but seemingly unites the world against this common threat of alien invasion.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:31,780
Speaker 0: And I think that there are at least two major reasons that I'm pretty sure were in the minds of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons while they were making Watchmen.

22
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:33,325
Speaker 0: But there are many other reasons.

23
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:37,280
Speaker 0: they were not thinking that also it must have been a squid.

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,685
Speaker 0: It could not have been, you know, a nuke.

25
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:46,280
Speaker 0: It could not have been some sort of biological weapon or a terrorist attack or any of these other sorts of things.

26
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,420
Speaker 0: And I will tell you now the two major reasons why it must have been a big, nasty extraterrestrial or seemingly extraterrestrial monster.

27
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:58,297
Speaker 0: Reason number one is the surface level.

28
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:58,780
Speaker 0: reason here.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,140
Speaker 0: Ozymandias was trying to unite the world against a common foe.

30
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:03,761
Speaker 0: Right.

31
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:05,465
Speaker 0: And that and thus bring about peace.

32
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:11,680
Speaker 0: We had this situation where the people of the United States reunited against their common foe of Russia.

33
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:12,242
Speaker 0: Right.

34
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:18,440
Speaker 0: In the or the Soviet Union, the Soviets were united in their common enemy of the United States.

35
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,781
Speaker 0: Right.

36
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:25,260
Speaker 0: So by creating a third external common foe for all humanity.

37
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:26,124
Speaker 0: Right.

38
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:29,040
Speaker 0: You could unite the world against that common foe.

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,880
Speaker 0: This is a common idea of neoconservative political ideology.

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,680
Speaker 0: When I say neoconservative, I don't mean, you know, the way that word is used today.

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,100
Speaker 0: I mean, the way the word neoconservative was originally used to describe people like, you know, Leo Strauss and such.

42
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:54,680
Speaker 0: But anyway, if he wants to unite the world, this threat really needs to be external to Earth.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,353
Speaker 0: You can't unite all of humanity if the threat is manmade.

44
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:00,360
Speaker 0: So if it was a nuke, let's say nuke New York.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,741
Speaker 0: Right.

46
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:06,380
Speaker 0: People would think it was the Russians sneaking in with some sort of suitcase nuke or something like that.

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,641
Speaker 0: Right.

48
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:13,480
Speaker 0: If it was some sort of, you know, terrorist attack, a biological weapon, well, there would be a significant possibility.

49
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:20,700
Speaker 0: And the most reasonable explanation, you know, Occam's razor would be that that biological attack was from Earth.

50
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:26,560
Speaker 0: You know, if it was, you know, even if he made it look like the nuke came from space.

51
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:27,003
Speaker 0: Right.

52
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:27,526
Speaker 0: They would be.

53
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,800
Speaker 0: it would be very easy to disbelieve it.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,167
Speaker 0: Oh, it could have been some trick.

55
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,400
Speaker 0: It could have been some manmade technology.

56
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:41,280
Speaker 0: So just in the surface level of Ozymandias achieving his goal of uniting the world against some common foe.

57
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:50,520
Speaker 0: The threat needed to be completely and undeniably, without any doubt, extraterrestrial in origin and real.

58
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:59,560
Speaker 0: And that, you know, the speed giant squid from space that releases the psychic attack, you know, fills that bill quite nicely.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,960
Speaker 0: Now, there are perhaps other things that could fit that bill quite nicely, you know, say, I mean, if you think about the movie Independence Day.

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,201
Speaker 0: Right.

61
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,086
Speaker 0: That's exactly what happened in that movie.

62
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:12,480
Speaker 0: You had these UFOs came from space only actually was an alien invasion.

63
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,782
Speaker 0: You know, that's a problem.

64
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:22,140
Speaker 0: But and the entire world, you know, they show you at the end of the movie, all like, you know, Israelis and Palestinians hugging each other and all this stuff.

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,501
Speaker 0: Right.

66
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,072
Speaker 0: It's because, you know, humanity was threatened.

67
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,719
Speaker 0: They united against his common foe.

68
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:27,681
Speaker 0: OK.

69
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:38,080
Speaker 0: The second reason that I think it must have been this big nasty squid is sort of obvious in that this big nasty squid monster really evokes Cthulhu.

70
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,142
Speaker 0: It's obvious.

71
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,125
Speaker 0: it evokes Cthulhu.

72
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:40,366
Speaker 0: Right.

73
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:43,156
Speaker 0: The big tentacled monster of of H.P.

74
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:44,200
Speaker 0: Lovecraft's creation.

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,581
Speaker 0: Right.

76
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:50,791
Speaker 0: And it is no secret that Alan Moore, at least, is a big fan of H.P.

77
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:56,520
Speaker 0: Lovecraft, as as myself, as are many other geeks out there in the world.

78
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:06,180
Speaker 0: I mean, Alan Moore, you know, he's had a there are many mentions of Cthulhu in one of the parts of the recent League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Black Dossier.

79
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,892
Speaker 0: Alan Moore's Yogoth Cultures book has many Cthulhu ish H.P.

80
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:14,920
Speaker 0: Lovecraftian mentions and nods in it.

81
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,405
Speaker 0: He is a big fan of these sorts of things.

82
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:19,750
Speaker 0: And the Watchmen is no exception.

83
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,874
Speaker 0: now, specifically when you think of H.P.

84
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,620
Speaker 0: Lovecraft, you know, and big tentacled monsters.

85
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,202
Speaker 0: I mean, H.P.

86
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:30,520
Speaker 0: Lovecraft wrote a lot a lot of things, you know, shoggits and old ones and deep ones and all sorts of things.

87
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,900
Speaker 0: But Cthulhu sort of comes to that, you know, it's it's the one people are most familiar with.

88
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,852
Speaker 0: And if you haven't read The Call of Cthulhu.

89
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:39,253
Speaker 0: Right.

90
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,400
Speaker 0: The short story, The Call of Cthulhu.

91
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,250
Speaker 0: I highly, highly recommend you read it.

92
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,234
Speaker 0: It's a short story.

93
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,920
Speaker 0: It'll take you maybe 10 minutes.

94
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:49,949
Speaker 0: You can just find it on the Internet, the full text of it.

95
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:50,149
Speaker 0: Right.

96
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,820
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's in the public domain, but there are websites just have the full text.

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,386
Speaker 0: You can just read it if you really want to pay for it.

98
00:06:56,426 --> 00:07:02,360
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can easily get it, you know, on, you know, many, many places by legitimate means.

99
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,889
Speaker 0: Usually they sell Lovecraftian.

100
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:08,140
Speaker 0: when you buy a book of Lovecraft stuff, you get a whole bunch of stories in there.

101
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:13,760
Speaker 0: So if you buy a book, you'll probably get Call of Cthulhu and thing on the doorstep and a whole bunch of other stories all in one book.

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:22,720
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you haven't read The Call of Cthulhu, this is probably a reason why you don't think the squid monster is necessary.

103
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:23,081
Speaker 0: Right.

104
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 0: Let me summarize what the story of Call of Cthulhu is for you.

105
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,300
Speaker 0: But first, I want to read the very first paragraph of the story Call of Cthulhu to you.

106
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,144
Speaker 0: This is the very first paragraph of the story.

107
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:42,860
Speaker 0: The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.

108
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,780
Speaker 0: We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity.

109
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,527
Speaker 0: And it was not meant that we should voyage far.

110
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:56,060
Speaker 0: The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little.

111
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:12,640
Speaker 0: But some day the pie, the piecing together of disassociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

112
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 0: So you see here, right, what he's saying in this first paragraph is like, look, you know, it's because humans don't know things that we aren't basically driven to insanity.

113
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,927
Speaker 0: There are things that man was not meant to know.

114
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:41,359
Speaker 0: And one day science will find these things and thus we will be completely driven insane by them, unable to comprehend them, you know, and it'll be the end of it.

115
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,804
Speaker 0: All right.

116
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,737
Speaker 0: And the story Call of Cthulhu goes like such.

117
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:46,300
Speaker 0: There is a man.

118
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,426
Speaker 0: He's sort of just, you know, your average guy.

119
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,668
Speaker 0: It's told in the first person.

120
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,840
Speaker 0: And pretty much before the story even started, his his uncle died.

121
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,120
Speaker 0: And this was sort of like the weird professor uncle, you know, that didn't have any children.

122
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,565
Speaker 0: And he was a widower.

123
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:02,946
Speaker 0: Right.

124
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:07,180
Speaker 0: So this guy is going to sort of take care of this, you know, strange uncle's estate.

125
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,380
Speaker 0: Pretty, pretty typical setup for, you know, sort of a pulpy kind of story.

126
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:17,320
Speaker 0: And while he's going through the uncle's things, he finds a box of strange stuff.

127
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,995
Speaker 0: And he was a professor of, you know, archaeology or something like that, you know.

128
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,660
Speaker 0: So, you know, having strange stuff.

129
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,332
Speaker 0: But this one particular box of stuff was very, very interesting.

130
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:29,800
Speaker 0: And our main character was very curious about it.

131
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:34,260
Speaker 0: And this box contained many strange things and strange writings and whatnot.

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,111
Speaker 0: And most notably, it contained this one bas relief.

133
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,460
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure I think that's how it's pronounced, the bas relief.

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,664
Speaker 0: It's bas relief.

135
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:40,945
Speaker 0: Right.

136
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:45,440
Speaker 0: So it's basically a small, you know, sort of a sculpture object.

137
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,267
Speaker 0: You know, it's a. it's a relief.

138
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:49,332
Speaker 0: You can look it up online.

139
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:50,799
Speaker 0: What a relief is, if you don't know.

140
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:56,980
Speaker 0: And, you know, the image on this relief was just so striking that he sort of was compelled.

141
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:00,352
Speaker 0: And his curiosity compelled him to find out more.

142
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,800
Speaker 0: So he began to investigate.

143
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:07,640
Speaker 0: Now, you see, this goes back to what was said in the first paragraph of the story.

144
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:08,003
Speaker 0: Right.

145
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,219
Speaker 0: There are things that man was not meant to know.

146
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:14,980
Speaker 0: You find out information that you didn't really want to know, but you were so curious.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,584
Speaker 0: And once you found it, you were driven insane.

148
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:29,320
Speaker 0: Well, in the course of his investigation of the this box of weird stuff and this relief, he finds out about, you know, crazy cults and he finds out about, you know, all sorts of nasty monsters.

149
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:35,240
Speaker 0: And then he finds, you know, Cthulhu, you know, and he learns, you know, basically too much.

150
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,766
Speaker 0: And it drives him mad.

151
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:46,820
Speaker 0: And, you know, it all relates to his uncle died sort of, you know, following the same pursuit of, you know, tracking down and learning things he was not meant to know.

152
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:54,800
Speaker 0: And if you look at how this relates to Watchmen, right, you can see how, you know, Rorschach, especially, but also the others.

153
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,182
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,960
Speaker 0: We're investigating throughout the book.

155
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:06,300
Speaker 0: And at the end, they found things that they found Ozymandias plan, things they were not meant to know.

156
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,800
Speaker 0: And it drove them, you know, sort of crazy, you know, mad, if you know, in a way, especially, you know, Rorschach, who found this.

157
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,029
Speaker 0: And, you know, then look at the comedian.

158
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:17,290
Speaker 0: Right.

159
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,720
Speaker 0: He he's dead at the beginning the story.

160
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:28,580
Speaker 0: But, you know, he found out what was going on on that island, things that man was not meant to know and thus was driven completely mad by it.

161
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,645
Speaker 0: And much is the same.

162
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:34,900
Speaker 0: So it is entirely fitting that Cthulhu would be the thing that was at the end.

163
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,321
Speaker 0: Right.

164
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:36,505
Speaker 0: It totally makes sense.

165
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:54,360
Speaker 0: And Ozymandias, I think he more fits the role of the cultists, you know, worshipping Cthulhu, trying to wake him up from his from his sleep, you know, and thus, you know, sort of already being mad like a cultist, but but not being driven mad by this journey for knowledge.

166
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,769
Speaker 0: It's like the cultists already know about Cthulhu.

167
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:57,030
Speaker 0: Right.

168
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,700
Speaker 0: They're just sort of crazy and are trying to bring them around.

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Speaker 0: And I think that's that's the role that Ozymandias fills is the role of the cultist in the story of the Call of Cthulhu.

170
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:09,114
Speaker 0: Now, the other things about Cthulhu, right.

171
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:10,340
Speaker 0: Think about Cthulhu himself.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,320
Speaker 0: Cthulhu is basically a big, giant, nasty dragon squid, humanoid monster from outer space, actually.

173
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:22,048
Speaker 0: And he sleeps in a place called Relay.

174
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:27,280
Speaker 0: It's basically an undersea, you know, sort of place that is hidden away from humanity.

175
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:28,629
Speaker 0: And he's sleeping there.

176
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,120
Speaker 0: And if he ever wakes up, we're all fucked.

177
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:42,199
Speaker 0: But right now he's sleeping and he's, you know, while he's sleeping, he's having these really nasty dreams and these nasty dreams that he's having are affecting, you know, the minds of people around the earth.

178
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:51,940
Speaker 0: You know, artists and and, you know, really creative people are being driven mad because the dreams of Cthulhu are getting into their minds as well.

179
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:56,799
Speaker 0: You know, and think about how this relates to the Watchmen.

180
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,020
Speaker 0: Right.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,737
Speaker 0: The monster in Watchmen was crafted by artists and writers.

182
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:03,420
Speaker 0: Right.

183
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:14,000
Speaker 0: Putting, you know, their twisted creations, the things of their twisted and nightmare dreams into, you know, this brain of a psychic.

184
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:14,402
Speaker 0: Right.

185
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:17,820
Speaker 0: That would release a psychic attack and drive everyone insane.

186
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:24,196
Speaker 0: I mean, Cthulhu himself, you know, you think about just the real world, right, was created by a writer, H.P.

187
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,840
Speaker 0: Lovecraft, who is a little insane.

188
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,568
Speaker 0: So you're sort of you see how this fits into the story of Cthulhu.

189
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:36,500
Speaker 0: instead of the monster giving, you know, he wants to create a monster whose nasty dreams will drive people insane.

190
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,840
Speaker 0: Well, instead, let's take, you know, the artists and their nasty dreams, put them into this brain.

191
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,648
Speaker 0: And thus we will create Cthulhu by, you know, the reverse process.

192
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:52,080
Speaker 0: You know, if Cthulhu causes these nasty dreams, we take nasty dreams and put them together.

193
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,383
Speaker 0: We'll get Cthulhu.

194
00:13:55,547 --> 00:14:00,176
Speaker 0: So, yeah, the you know, the image of this big monster at the end evokes.

195
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,440
Speaker 0: Cthulhu evokes this story.

196
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,520
Speaker 0: And if you know this story, you can see how well it fits right along with Watchmen.

197
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,273
Speaker 0: And if you know how much Alan Moore loves H.P.

198
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,640
Speaker 0: Lovecraft, which is no secret.

199
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,132
Speaker 0: This whole thing is painfully obvious.

200
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:15,820
Speaker 0: It is without a doubt intentional.

201
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:16,780
Speaker 0: Right.

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:27,060
Speaker 0: And replacing that monster with anything else, you know, I mean, that did not evoke Cthulhu, did not evoke Lovecraftian horror would sort of not fit.

203
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,401
Speaker 0: Right.

204
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:31,520
Speaker 0: You'd be losing this whole aspect of the story that was without a doubt intentional.

205
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,379
Speaker 0: I mean, if it was some other sort of alien invasion, let's say it was, you know, green men.

206
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:36,122
Speaker 0: Right.

207
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:40,920
Speaker 0: It would achieve the same effect for Ozymandias, perhaps if executed properly.

208
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,220
Speaker 0: But it would not evoke this story of Cthulhu.

209
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,188
Speaker 0: It would not evoke the idea of people being driven insane.

210
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,840
Speaker 0: The whole part about, you know, artists, you know, working together to on the island to create this.

211
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,580
Speaker 0: The whole part about the comedian discovering it and being driven insane.

212
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,331
Speaker 0: None of those things would make sense.

213
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,480
Speaker 0: None of those things would fit.

214
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,755
Speaker 0: You know, if it was a nuke, the comedian wouldn't have been driven mad by it.

215
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,841
Speaker 0: Right.

216
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,927
Speaker 0: Only it was biological attack.

217
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:12,480
Speaker 0: He wouldn't have been driven mad only by some sort of Lovecraftian horror.

218
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,100
Speaker 0: Do all those other pieces of the story fit together?

219
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:21,040
Speaker 0: Now, there's one other aspect of Lovecraftian heart that I would like to point out in the Watchmen.

220
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,125
Speaker 0: That is Antarctica.

221
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,331
Speaker 0: There are.

222
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,360
Speaker 0: there is a Lovecraftian story.

223
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,642
Speaker 0: I forget which one it is.

224
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:34,880
Speaker 0: I should have I should have looked this up before I recorded this where, you know, there is horror in Antarctica and basically the old ones, some alien race.

225
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,688
Speaker 0: You know, they're not, you know, Cthulhu.

226
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,520
Speaker 0: They're just, you know, some aliens that are much more advanced.

227
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:45,220
Speaker 0: We're in Antarctica, sort of, you know, frozen in the ice, if you will.

228
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Speaker 0: And, you know, people go there and discover it and find things that man was not meant to know.

229
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:59,160
Speaker 0: And if you know the end of Watchmen, Ozymandias is, you know, Fort Karnak is in Antarctica.

230
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,820
Speaker 0: That is no accident.

231
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:07,900
Speaker 0: I believe that, you know, and I will argue that it was clearly a reference to that Lovecraftian story.

232
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:21,020
Speaker 0: And, you know, when you piece that together with the Cthulhu tale and the monster and the psychic wave that drives everyone insane and the artists and writers that create it and the comedian being driven insane.

233
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,184
Speaker 0: You know, I haven't seen the movie yet.

234
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:30,080
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a good movie, but I've heard that there is no big monster at the end of the movie.

235
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:39,880
Speaker 0: And from my point of view, you know, based on these arguments and some others I can make from, you know, other aspects such as science and politics and psychology.

236
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:48,100
Speaker 0: It has to be a squid or squid monster Lovecraftian horror for it to work as intended.

237
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:55,680
Speaker 0: And without that, I think you are losing a rather significant part of the story of Watchmen and a significant part of the impact of the ending.

238
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:59,460
Speaker 0: And so even before seeing the movie, I'm a little disappointed.

239
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:07,800
Speaker 0: So for anyone out there who is like, you know, arguing that, oh, it didn't have to be a squid, something else works just as well, such and such.

240
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,679
Speaker 0: I think you're wrong and I will argue it with you.

241
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,060
Speaker 0: And I think I have made my point pretty clearly.

242
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,400
Speaker 0: And if you haven't read Call of Cthulhu and you have read Watchmen or, you know, you really you need to read both.

243
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,200
Speaker 0: They're sort of you know, they go very, very nicely together.

244
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,140
Speaker 0: And that's just about all I have to say about that.
