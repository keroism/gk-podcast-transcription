1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,225
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, November 29th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:12,147
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:13,550
Speaker 1: I'm Skye.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,200
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, the 100%.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,219
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,629
Speaker 1: I was cleaning out the junk drawer the other day.

7
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:30,033
Speaker 1: You know the junk drawer?

8
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,958
Speaker 1: Everyone has one, that drawer with shit in it.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,865
Speaker 1: Like random stuff, there's nowhere to put it.

10
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:35,427
Speaker 1: Like what's this?

11
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:36,812
Speaker 1: Receipt or a key?

12
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:37,916
Speaker 1: I don't know who's key this is.

13
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,040
Speaker 1: Put it in the drawer, forget about it.

14
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:44,390
Speaker 1: Well, I cleaned that drawer out, and in that drawer I found a roll of film.

15
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:49,540
Speaker 1: Like, it was already rewound inside the little cylinder.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,704
Speaker 1: So, it's been taken.

17
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:53,208
Speaker 1: Someone has taken pictures on it.

18
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,995
Speaker 1: It was like standard 35mm film, the kind I used to use like at RIT.

19
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:01,605
Speaker 1: The latest date...

20
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,392
Speaker 0: Was it that weird Advantix film?

21
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:04,015
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no.

22
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,260
Speaker 0: Okay, because that's the kind I had.

23
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:09,377
Speaker 1: The latest date this could be from, based on my estimations of the last time I used...

24
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:10,180
Speaker 0: 1999 or 2000.

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is probably from high school, maybe...

26
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:13,751
Speaker 0: The year 2000, which was 11, 12 years ago.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,600
Speaker 1: There is a tiny chance it is from our freshman year of RIT, but I kind of doubt that.

28
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,286
Speaker 1: I really wonder what's on it, and I gotta find someone to develop it.

29
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,640
Speaker 1: And once I do, as long as I'm not arrested, because there's pictures of like, I don't know, some dirty bomb terrorist plot and I just found this film.

30
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:36,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, wouldn't that suck?

31
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:40,233
Speaker 0: Like, you just find a roll of film and you're curious, you take it to be developed, and it's child porn.

32
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,116
Speaker 0: And then you're in jail.

33
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:42,480
Speaker 0: Because you found it on the street.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would suck.

35
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:46,460
Speaker 1: It's one of the reasons why film sucks.

36
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:47,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,965
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like.

38
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:52,559
Speaker 1: if I find a USB stick on the ground, I gotta go to a techie and be like, "Can you develop this for

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:52,680
Speaker 1: me?".

40
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:53,160
Speaker 1: Exactly.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,644
Speaker 1: Actually, some people do.

42
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:58,397
Speaker 1: I can imagine someone giving me a USB stick like, "Yeah, there's stuff on here.

43
00:01:58,477 --> 00:01:59,179
Speaker 0: Can you get it off for

44
00:01:59,199 --> 00:01:59,239
Speaker 0: me?".

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,780
Speaker 0: I imagine though, the dumbest of the dumb people take their SD card to the drugstore and they plug it into that machine.

46
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,959
Speaker 1: And have the things print out or go onto a CD.

47
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:07,381
Speaker 1: Yep.

48
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:12,760
Speaker 1: But I went to like four drugstores and I realized that, oh yeah, drugstores don't really develop film anymore.

49
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,600
Speaker 0: No, they just have those machines, like I just said.

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I found a couple of places, but they're not near my work.

51
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:26,160
Speaker 1: So sometime in the next week, I'm gonna take this roll of film, probably the last film I will ever touch with my hands in the rest of my life.

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,268
Speaker 0: Well, you didn't even touch the film.

53
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:28,620
Speaker 0: The film's inside a plastic tube.

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,405
Speaker 1: I will never again touch the container.

55
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,338
Speaker 1: I will never again touch a container with film in it.

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,920
Speaker 1: Unless maybe I get the old 8mm videos from my parents' childhood.

57
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,407
Speaker 1: So we'll see what's on that thing.

58
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,340
Speaker 1: Most likely, awkward nerdy pictures of me in high school.

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,163
Speaker 0: Alright.

60
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,219
Speaker 0: I got nothing.

61
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:47,279
Speaker 1: Okay.

62
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:48,720
Speaker 0: Okay, let's do news.

63
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do that.

64
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,543
Speaker 0: So check this out.

65
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:51,768
Speaker 0: The Humble Bundles.

66
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:54,880
Speaker 0: They're coming out, but a lot more bundles more frequently lately.

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm less and less excited about each bundle.

68
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:00,260
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, a lot of the bundles, they just have shit you already got in them.

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,140
Speaker 0: It's like, come on guys, every bundle should be 100% consisting of things that have never been in any bundle ever.

70
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,300
Speaker 0: Now I can understand if there's some overlap between the Steam sale and the bundle, right?

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,780
Speaker 0: But it's like, this bundle's got shit that have been in bundles before.

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,580
Speaker 1: I sadly have a much more direct reason why I'm not so excited.

73
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,560
Speaker 0: I own a bunch of bundles and I've never played any of the games in them?

74
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,740
Speaker 1: I haven't played more than half of the games I own on Steam.

75
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:30,167
Speaker 1: Not even like, haven't played a lot.

76
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,440
Speaker 1: I mean, have never even double clicked on it.

77
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,680
Speaker 0: Yup, exactly.

78
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,219
Speaker 1: So, what do I do now?

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,503
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

80
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,370
Speaker 0: I basically haven't been buying any games.

81
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,218
Speaker 0: The only game I bought was Zelda, which is pretty good.

82
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:41,840
Speaker 0: You should get it.

83
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,752
Speaker 1: Now Scott, why aren't we playing these games?

84
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:44,256
Speaker 1: Well, uh...

85
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,920
Speaker 0: Some of the games you play for like a minute and you realize they're not worth playing.

86
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,387
Speaker 1: I don't even get to that point.

87
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,555
Speaker 1: I don't even click on them.

88
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:51,300
Speaker 1: You know why?

89
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,909
Speaker 1: I'm going through, here's my Steam stats.

90
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,256
Speaker 1: 150 hours played of Counter-Strike Source since they started counting.

91
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:01,040
Speaker 1: Last played, yesterday.

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,760
Speaker 0: First played, the day came out.

93
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,235
Speaker 1: First played, before the P90.

94
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,422
Speaker 0: That's right.

95
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:11,020
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the current bundle is the humble introversion bundle.

96
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,700
Speaker 0: And you know, introversion, those are the guys who made Uplink, Darwinia, Defcon, Multiwinnia.

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,480
Speaker 1: You mean all the games that had critical flaws?

98
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:17,880
Speaker 0: Uplink didn't really.

99
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:19,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, Uplink was okay.

100
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,920
Speaker 1: But Multiwinnia had critical flaws.

101
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:22,122
Speaker 0: Yes.

102
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,550
Speaker 0: And Darwinia wasn't flawed, but was single player.

103
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,500
Speaker 0: And Defcon is flawed, slightly.

104
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, Defcon is a great concept, but the controls for Defcon...

105
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,840
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is that to win, you had to micromanage the airplanes and the submarines and such.

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,983
Speaker 1: I was fine with that.

107
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:49,400
Speaker 1: The only part that sucked was micromanaging the silos because you basically had to do an equivalent of kiting, where you have to coordinate all the silos to make sure 10 ICBMs are going to one place at the same time.

108
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,760
Speaker 1: And that was the least possible fun you could have playing that game.

109
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:03,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fun, you know, they needed to make it more abstract, where the micromanagement of exactly where and when you clicked at what second didn't matter, as much as simply your decision of when to click, relatively speaking.

110
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,520
Speaker 1: Actually, the fleet movement and the submarine stuff, I love.

111
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,920
Speaker 0: The movement, yes, but the controlling of the anyway.

112
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,622
Speaker 1: Even that was fine.

113
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:20,074
Speaker 1: Literally, the only thing they needed to change is that the silos should fire intelligently if you give them a target, rather than basically defaulting to shoot a missile every time.

114
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,760
Speaker 1: I'm ready to be trivially shot down.

115
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so that's the current bundle.

116
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:29,929
Speaker 0: If you haven't played those games, this bundle's well worth it, even just for uplink, because, I mean, like, you can pay whatever you want, right?

117
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,200
Speaker 0: So I think you can pay, like, a penny and get all this shit.

118
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,159
Speaker 1: And uplink is pretty fun.

119
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 0: If you pay more than the average, right, which is currently $3.86, you get Aquaria, which I already have from some other bundle.

120
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,060
Speaker 1: I already have that as well.

121
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,960
Speaker 0: And Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I probably have from some other bundle.

122
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:46,419
Speaker 1: I actually don't have that.

123
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,260
Speaker 0: You'll also get Dungeons of Dreadmoor, which actually looks interesting, and I might buy the bundle just for that.

124
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,100
Speaker 0: You also get prototypes of two things that Introversion made, which is a subversion city generator and a voxel tech demo.

125
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,466
Speaker 0: Subversion was the game that they were gonna make.

126
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:04,959
Speaker 0: that was, like, the bank heist game, which I guess got shit-canned, I don't know.

127
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:09,960
Speaker 0: But, the most interesting thing of this whole bundle, and the re- The most interesting thing.

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:22,660
Speaker 0: The reason that I'm definitely gonna buy it for $3.87, or whatever, 1 cent above the average, maybe just 5 bucks to play it safe, right, is you get the source code to Darwinia, Multiwinia, Defcon, and uplink.

129
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,419
Speaker 1: I did not pay attention to the news enough to know that.

130
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,879
Speaker 0: That's pretty epic right there.

131
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:33,120
Speaker 0: Also, you know, they always show the top contributors for the bundle?

132
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:40,780
Speaker 0: Alright, who do you think made, 'cause remember, I think that for the first bundle, Notch gave the most monies, right?

133
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,340
Speaker 0: Who do you think is the number one contributor for this bundle?

134
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,600
Speaker 1: Number one contributor?

135
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:46,349
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

136
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:49,460
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

137
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,368
Speaker 0: It's another bundle.

138
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:53,300
Speaker 0: took their money and gave it to this bundle.

139
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,254
Speaker 0: What?

140
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:54,460
Speaker 0: Really?

141
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,960
Speaker 0: Humble Brony Bundle gave $12.50 to the Humble Introversion Bundle as the number one contributor.

142
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,840
Speaker 1: Wait, $12.50?

143
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,523
Speaker 0: No, $1250.

144
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:04,617
Speaker 1: Okay.

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,920
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's a Humble Brony Bundle.

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,940
Speaker 1: What, pray tell, is in the Humble Brony Bundle?

147
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,000
Speaker 1: Is that just all those kind of knock-off platformers that have a Rainbow Dash in them?

148
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:18,969
Speaker 0: Uh, ahem.

149
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:20,320
Speaker 0: Humble Brony Bundle.

150
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,399
Speaker 1: Or is it 10 Dating Sims?

151
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:22,318
Speaker 0: Hold on.

152
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,960
Speaker 1: And then some sort of, like, erotic dating sim.

153
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:32,240
Speaker 0: The Humble Brony Bundle is currently at $35.12, so $12.50 of that they gave to Humble Introversion Bundle, right?

154
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,802
Speaker 0: A-ta-ta.

155
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:39,921
Speaker 0: Humble Brony Bundle are packs of games, so Humble, we have ponies coming together to create a fun... Oh!

156
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:45,380
Speaker 0: It's a way for bronies to come together and create a fund to buy one big copy of the Humble Indie Bundle.

157
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:50,218
Speaker 1: So then!

158
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:51,678
Speaker 0: So there you have it.

159
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:57,956
Speaker 0: They pooled their money to buy the Humble Indie Bundle once, and they're at $35.12, they've only given $12.50 so far.

160
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,139
Speaker 1: That was sadly anti-climactic, because I know for a fact that people...

161
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,739
Speaker 0: I wish that they had a bundle of, like, something, but anyway...

162
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:15,060
Speaker 1: 'Cause if you've seen, there's this amazing trend of, you know, because people are really big into doing remixed stuff with the ponies, is that a ton of people think that they're gonna make, like, the next great game with ponies.

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,820
Speaker 1: There's, like, 10 different groups of people making, like, Dating Sims and platformers and quest games...

164
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,055
Speaker 0: Phoenix Wright 1, this MMOs...

165
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,660
Speaker 1: I don't know, as much as I would like to play one of those, I think Bobo's Big Adventure is what I'm waiting for.

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,004
Speaker 0: Bobo is definitely where it's at.

167
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:33,960
Speaker 0: Also, you know, plenty of the games that we've been waiting for for a long time are still not out yet.

168
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,618
Speaker 0: Retro City Rampage, Monaco, Spy Party... Come on, guys.

169
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, Monaco, I would pay a lot of money for just to be able to play right now.

170
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,738
Speaker 0: Seriously, those games, they're gonna be out probably within the next two years.

171
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,780
Speaker 1: The crappy, you know, not finished version I played at PAX a long time ago was enough for me to pay money.

172
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,940
Speaker 0: Right, so within the next two years, all three of those games will probably be out.

173
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,199
Speaker 0: And, yeah, that's it.

174
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:08,080
Speaker 1: Sadly, of all these games, right now, I'm most looking forward to a Bobo because it gives me everything that I like about Charles Barkley's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden without it being a JRPG.

175
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,923
Speaker 0: Exactly.

176
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:09,588
Speaker 0: My thoughts.

177
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:12,361
Speaker 0: 100%.

178
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,988
Speaker 1: So, there's an article on Slashdot.

179
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,919
Speaker 1: It amazes me that articles like this get written or that anyone even... Rick Romero would be proud.

180
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,400
Speaker 1: Why it sucks to work at Zynga.

181
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,380
Speaker 0: Well, why wouldn't it suck to work at Zynga?

182
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,717
Speaker 1: Alright, so you work for a company that makes things that I would barely classify as games.

183
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,303
Speaker 0: They should make an article.

184
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,350
Speaker 0: why the good parts about working at Zynga?

185
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,898
Speaker 0: because I assumed that all the parts were bad, so it's like...

186
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,600
Speaker 1: According to the article, I actually read these articles and read some of the comments and everything.

187
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:45,920
Speaker 1: And the consensus seems to be that EA has much better working conditions.

188
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:47,680
Speaker 0: I can't imagine.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,898
Speaker 1: Which is kind of amazing, but really Zynga is...

190
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,664
Speaker 0: Man, you know what?

191
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,359
Speaker 0: Foxconn has better working conditions.

192
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:02,520
Speaker 1: Zynga is perhaps the most destructive force in gaming the world has ever seen, but I can't blame them because they don't actually make games.

193
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,040
Speaker 1: It's like they're making a different product that the average person conflates with games.

194
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:15,840
Speaker 1: They think that, I don't know, Tribes 2-2 or Skyrim somehow on some level competes with a click on stuff to level it up game in Facebook.

195
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,533
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it takes people's time.

196
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:19,660
Speaker 0: There's people who do both.

197
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:22,544
Speaker 0: It's weird, right?

198
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:27,140
Speaker 0: Because with most games, at least, that aren't subscription-based, right?

199
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:29,311
Speaker 0: It's not about how much time someone spends.

200
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,880
Speaker 0: It doesn't correlate to how much money they make.

201
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,888
Speaker 0: It's just, did they buy the game or not?

202
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:34,816
Speaker 0: What do they fucking care if you play Skyrim?

203
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:35,339
Speaker 0: You bought it.

204
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,616
Speaker 0: They shouldn't even give a shit if you play it for one second or one year.

205
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,400
Speaker 1: Maybe they care because the designer likes you to enjoy the game or something, but that's not a business concern.

206
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:52,160
Speaker 0: Right, but in fact, they'd actually probably like it more if you didn't play the game so much because then you'd need something to occupy your time and you would buy a different game.

207
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,678
Speaker 0: If you were so obsessed with Skyrim that you played it for a long fucking time, you wouldn't be buying other games.

208
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,432
Speaker 1: No, then they'll make plenty of money off of you, Scott, because Horse Armor.

209
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,780
Speaker 1: They'll sell you DLC and you'll buy it gladly.

210
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,866
Speaker 0: Well, that's what they're doing now, right?

211
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,430
Speaker 0: But that's why they're doing that now.

212
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:17,420
Speaker 0: What instead they should do is they should make games that cost a dollar, but only occupy you for like five minutes so that you have to spend another dollar five minutes or now on a different game instead of a DLC for a big game.

213
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:26,000
Speaker 1: But it's weird because on one hand, I could argue that things like that, the things they make, on some level do compete with games.

214
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:39,540
Speaker 1: I'll bet that Nintendo is actually hurting from the fact that, you know, all things considered, in the end, the average really young child is going to have as much fun playing Diner Dash as he will playing a $50 first party Nintendo game on a DS.

215
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,206
Speaker 1: And they already probably have an iPhone for the kid.

216
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:49,820
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, at least when people, you know, gamers complain that Myst ruined gaming.

217
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,740
Speaker 1: Scott used to always say that because Myst was a game that came out that wasn't that great.

218
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,776
Speaker 0: Myst did create a large pile of crappy games and it did have a profound effect on gaming for many years.

219
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,180
Speaker 0: that has only recently worn off.

220
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:12,160
Speaker 0: And it was, if Myst had not come out in the way, in the fashion that it did, the gaming for the course of those years would have been significantly different.

221
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,419
Speaker 0: And I argue most likely better.

222
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:15,754
Speaker 1: Drew, I did not say you were wrong because Myst...

223
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,967
Speaker 0: For people who don't know, right, so here's the basic argument, right?

224
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:23,140
Speaker 0: Myst was a game that had graphics that were basically astounding for its time.

225
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,599
Speaker 1: But no, they were astounding to people who didn't know better because they were basically just stills.

226
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,203
Speaker 0: Right, they basically, they cheated.

227
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:36,480
Speaker 0: What they did is, right, when you have a computer, right, people always, you know, remember it wasn't Emily's boss who was like they wanted the game to look like Toy Story, right?

228
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,380
Speaker 0: The reason that Toy Story looks better than video games is because they render Toy Story very slowly.

229
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,940
Speaker 0: They can spend an hour rendering one frame if they want because after the frame is rendered, they just save it to a hard drive.

230
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:55,536
Speaker 0: And then you can watch the frames at, you know, 40, whatever, 30, 20, whatever frames a second.

231
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:56,700
Speaker 0: that, you know, the movie is.

232
00:12:57,562 --> 00:13:01,080
Speaker 0: And you don't have to render them at, you know, the same speed that you're going to watch them.

233
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:08,656
Speaker 0: Video games, you need to render the frames as fast as the person is looking at them, which means you need to render at least 75 FPS if you have a 75 hertz display.

234
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:18,240
Speaker 0: Which means that you have to decrease the quality to be much less than Toy Story, which is rendering probably a frame a second at best.

235
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:27,380
Speaker 1: And Myst came out in an era, I mean, Myst had talking videos in it and that was an era when I was amazed that a MIDI file would play in a game.

236
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:36,460
Speaker 0: So Myst was a game that had all of its graphics pre-rendered and stored on a CD-ROM as opposed to being rendered in real time by a video card.

237
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,124
Speaker 0: So even for years after...

238
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:38,826
Speaker 1: Video card?

239
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:39,708
Speaker 1: Yeah.

240
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:40,290
Speaker 1: Back then?

241
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:41,774
Speaker 0: Video cards didn't exist then.

242
00:13:41,794 --> 00:13:43,740
Speaker 1: That was video memory on your computer.

243
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:44,221
Speaker 0: Right.

244
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:48,854
Speaker 0: So in those days, it took years for it to be a game that looked as good as Myst.

245
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:50,940
Speaker 0: that wasn't also pre-rendered.

246
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:56,880
Speaker 0: And as a result, the standards for what people expected of video game graphics went way up.

247
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,280
Speaker 1: Kind of like the difference between, like, Rebel Assault, I think it was called, versus TIE Fighter.

248
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,552
Speaker 0: Also, people sold a shit ton of copies of Myst.

249
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:05,500
Speaker 0: It sold a ton of fucking copies for its day.

250
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,458
Speaker 0: Now at the same time, I would argue... Even among normal people, so...

251
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,425
Speaker 1: It wasn't Myst's fault, because...

252
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:15,140
Speaker 0: Well, you're saying that it was inevitable that someone was gonna do it?

253
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,840
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I'm saying that I think Myst was a pretty crap game and I think the puzzles were pretty arbitrary and crap.

254
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,049
Speaker 1: But, I understand why some people would like that game.

255
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,860
Speaker 1: The problem wasn't that Myst created these expectations.

256
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,680
Speaker 1: The problem was that the game industry, the people who made the decisions as to what games to make and what demographics to go after, saw Myst come out...

257
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,786
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I'm saying.

258
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:36,576
Speaker 1: And decided that that is the way to go.

259
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:37,380
Speaker 1: It wasn't Myst's fault.

260
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,260
Speaker 1: It was everyone else's fault but Myst.

261
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,865
Speaker 0: Well, no, but that's the thing.

262
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,190
Speaker 0: It was still Myst's fault, right?

263
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,440
Speaker 0: Myst had these pre-rendered graphics that were amazing.

264
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,120
Speaker 1: That's like blaming the kitten that Hitler tripped over for the genocide.

265
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,740
Speaker 0: They saw it sold incredibly well with these pre-rendered graphics.

266
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:58,520
Speaker 0: Thus, the people in the game industry saw that as the example and believed that good graphics were gonna sell a ton of copies.

267
00:14:58,821 --> 00:14:59,980
Speaker 1: Ah, but here's the rub.

268
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,220
Speaker 0: So for years, they put graphics as a higher priority than everything else.

269
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,660
Speaker 0: Scott, they didn't think really about why it sold.

270
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,880
Speaker 0: And only recently have they realized their mistake.

271
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:14,860
Speaker 1: Because the graphics were part of it, but part of why it sold is a lot of the people who got into Myst were not gamers until Myst.

272
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,269
Speaker 1: They didn't play games.

273
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,377
Speaker 1: They didn't think of games.

274
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,019
Speaker 1: Gaming on a computer was not something they did.

275
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,300
Speaker 1: And Myst was kind of this thing that a lot of moms and a lot of non-gamers really got into, and that was great.

276
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,056
Speaker 1: But the rest of the industry said, "Oh, look at all these people buying this

277
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:30,338
Speaker 1: game.".

278
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:36,080
Speaker 1: And they were more interested in money than whatever demographic they might have been targeting in the past.

279
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:41,620
Speaker 1: So they decided to shift gears and all go after this one, new, poorly understood demographic all at once.

280
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
Speaker 1: I feel like the current game industry is doing the same thing.

281
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,814
Speaker 0: Right, only instead of it being graphics-based, it's angry birds-based.

282
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,799
Speaker 1: Except Angry Birds is a pretty good game.

283
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,773
Speaker 0: It's the best of them, yeah.

284
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:55,540
Speaker 0: It's playable.

285
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,865
Speaker 1: Angry Birds at least is a game.

286
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:02,300
Speaker 1: The majority of the Zynga stuff, I would argue, don't meet any reasonable definition of game.

287
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,571
Speaker 0: Anyway, Super Stickman Golf, let me tell you.

288
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:05,114
Speaker 0: That's the shit.

289
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,300
Speaker 0: You should get that if you got a phone.

290
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,800
Speaker 1: I saw you guys talking about that while I was in Japan.

291
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,680
Speaker 0: Super Stickman Golf is the business.

292
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,816
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

293
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:22,409
Speaker 1: I haven't used one of these in a while, and partly because they've passed.

294
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,321
Speaker 1: They've had their time.

295
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,637
Speaker 1: I used to love-- You've seen one.

296
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:26,210
Speaker 0: You've seen them all?

297
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,110
Speaker 1: Well, partly thanks to the internet, I think I have seen them all.

298
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,010
Speaker 0: I have also seen them all.

299
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,798
Speaker 1: It is very rare that I see a fail video.

300
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,890
Speaker 1: that is not just basically a retelling of a fail video I've already seen.

301
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:42,770
Speaker 1: And in those rare instances, I'm very surprised, but at the same time, I feel like my cup runneth over.

302
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,090
Speaker 1: I can only see so many people hit in the nuts by their own stupidity before I no longer care.

303
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,130
Speaker 1: So I present to you the fail collection of 2011.

304
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,690
Speaker 0: Well, it's the November, I think, specifically.

305
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:54,556
Speaker 1: Ah, it might be.

306
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:55,121
Speaker 1: I don't know.

307
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,170
Speaker 1: It was on CollegeHumor recently.

308
00:16:57,412 --> 00:17:00,510
Speaker 1: If you have not watched fail videos before, many people I know have not.

309
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:09,290
Speaker 1: It was a thing that was actually surprisingly, in many ways, at least among my kind of crew, bigger ten years ago and kind of faded a little bit.

310
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,286
Speaker 1: Because there's no longer the mystique of like, "I got this video of a guy crashing a helicopter.

311
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:15,249
Speaker 1: Now it's all just on

312
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:15,569
Speaker 1: YouTube.".

313
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,310
Speaker 1: You can type in the specific kind of fail you want, and YouTube will give it to you.

314
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:35,430
Speaker 1: This, however, is a classical collection of fail, because unlike a lot of misnamed fail compilations, as far as I could see watching this, every single one of these was the result of a person taking an undue, unnecessary risk with improper equipment and/or being drunk.

315
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:36,788
Speaker 0: And deserving it.

316
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like, you know, random guy gets, you know, like a helicopter falls on him.

317
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:44,490
Speaker 1: It's guy's a dumbass and pilot's a helicopter incorrectly.

318
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,072
Speaker 0: Yup.

319
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:45,970
Speaker 1: Anyway.

320
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:47,690
Speaker 1: I present to you a fail video.

321
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:58,370
Speaker 0: So, one of the things that we hate the most, slow people on the sidewalks and the stairs and the platforms and the places where there are bottlenecks of humanity.

322
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,470
Speaker 1: I mean, I understand that they don't have anywhere to be, but I got places to be.

323
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,072
Speaker 0: That's right.

324
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:06,310
Speaker 0: So, at least walk single file and stay to the right so I can go past you like lightning.

325
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:09,285
Speaker 0: You won't even see me, like Rainbow Dash.

326
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:09,688
Speaker 0: Ah, shit.

327
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:09,990
Speaker 0: Anyway.

328
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,662
Speaker 0: Some guy in Japan, he has the same problem as us.

329
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,447
Speaker 0: He hates the slow walking people.

330
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:17,470
Speaker 0: He just wants to burn by them.

331
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,310
Speaker 1: Oh my god, Scott, when I was in Japan, I don't think you understand how slow people walk there.

332
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,956
Speaker 0: They were going so slow, right?

333
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:28,630
Speaker 0: So, this guy, being Japanese, where, you know, they have the skills to solve every problem known to humanity.

334
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,145
Speaker 0: What?

335
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,921
Speaker 0: Has solved the problem of the slow walking person.

336
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,330
Speaker 0: He took, well, just watch the video.

337
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:37,148
Speaker 1: Two problems.

338
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:46,970
Speaker 1: This would only work in Japan because of the way Japan is when it comes to laws about what constitutes a thing that is allowed to be on the sidewalk or not allowed to be on the sidewalk.

339
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,510
Speaker 1: Two, it only works because it's Japan and people pay attention to this thing.

340
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, this wouldn't work in New York or I would do it, no matter how awkward.

341
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,172
Speaker 1: Dude, I do do it.

342
00:18:55,212 --> 00:19:00,048
Speaker 1: In New York, I use that device when I'm on the thing to which that device is usually attached.

343
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:00,570
Speaker 1: You know what?

344
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,650
Speaker 1: No one has ever responded to it, except once a guy turned around and flipped me off.

345
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,474
Speaker 0: That's right.

346
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,590
Speaker 0: But anyway, this guy is genius.

347
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,437
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, we will be at MagFest.

348
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:17,390
Speaker 1: We will be on two of the gaming intellectuals discussion round tables.

349
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,276
Speaker 1: One of those will have the Dr.

350
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,730
Speaker 1: Hazard on with us to ream us a new intellectual asshole.

351
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:29,990
Speaker 1: We will also be doing advanced Beyond Dungeons and Dragons 3.0.

352
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,410
Speaker 0: Why don't you just call it advanced Beyond Dungeons and Dragons and leave it at that?

353
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what we're calling it.

354
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:40,710
Speaker 1: Basically, we're redoing the old Beyond D&D panel because that was the first panel we ever did at Apex, and I feel like we can do better now.

355
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,667
Speaker 1: Also, we've played a lot more indie RPGs since then.

356
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,550
Speaker 1: We are going to be at a nerd night on December 8th, giving a short version of Losing Should Be Fun.

357
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:58,090
Speaker 1: I'll post a link to the details and all that, so if you're in the area and you're okay with, I think, paying some money to see some geeky lectures.

358
00:19:58,312 --> 00:19:58,769
Speaker 0: I wouldn't pay.

359
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't pay for anything.

360
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:00,768
Speaker 0: To see us, I wouldn't pay.

361
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,849
Speaker 1: Ah, it depends.

362
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:06,370
Speaker 0: I mean, this isn't like going to a convention where you're paying to get into PAX and you're giving us an hour of the PAX time.

363
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,046
Speaker 1: No, there's someone else doing a lecture before ours.

364
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:09,710
Speaker 1: I don't know, I didn't look.

365
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,368
Speaker 0: Are they better than us?

366
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:10,953
Speaker 1: I don't know.

367
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:13,750
Speaker 1: It might be about biology or something.

368
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,120
Speaker 0: Oh, so we're the last?

369
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:16,290
Speaker 0: It's just two people and that's it?

370
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:17,370
Speaker 1: I think it's just two lectures.

371
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:18,388
Speaker 0: And we're number two?

372
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:18,661
Speaker 0: Yeah.

373
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:19,209
Speaker 0: Okay.

374
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:19,835
Speaker 1: I don't know.

375
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,804
Speaker 1: I barely know.

376
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:21,370
Speaker 1: I had email conversations.

377
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,576
Speaker 0: You don't even know what we're doing?

378
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,530
Speaker 0: Would we agree to a thing that we don't know what it is?

379
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,598
Speaker 0: It's Blues Brothers.

380
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,910
Speaker 1: I found us a gig, Scott.

381
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,568
Speaker 0: Dude, great.

382
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,750
Speaker 1: Got the band back together.

383
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,250
Speaker 0: Okay.

384
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, MAGFest, PAX East is coming up.

385
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:35,668
Speaker 1: If you haven't already bought your badge, well, you're a dumbass.

386
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,230
Speaker 1: Buy a badge.

387
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,309
Speaker 0: If you didn't get your hotel room, what the fuck?

388
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,130
Speaker 0: PAX East and MAGFest, if you're planning to go to either one of those, you should already have your badge and hotel right this instant.

389
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,029
Speaker 0: If you didn't get it yesterday, you fucked up.

390
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:47,809
Speaker 1: The current book club book is?

391
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,110
Speaker 0: A double book club.

392
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:55,869
Speaker 0: You have to read The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry, which should take you about an hour or two.

393
00:20:56,451 --> 00:21:01,309
Speaker 0: And then you have to read a real book, also by Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry, which is Winds, Sand, and Stars.

394
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,538
Speaker 0: It may have a different name in your country.

395
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,950
Speaker 0: Refer to Wikipedia for more details.

396
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,540
Speaker 0: Yes.

397
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:14,410
Speaker 0: Also, go to the internets and look for Geek Nights on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and FrontRecruit.com and all those places.

398
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:24,970
Speaker 1: In fact, most importantly, because I realized lately that- Whatever place is most convenient for you- The majority of you out there who listen to Geek Nights do not participate in our forum or anything on the website.

399
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:46,630
Speaker 1: So I figure I should tell you all that all of the lectures we did at PAX East last year are on YouTube in their entirety, and I'm uploading stuff that we did from PAX Prime this past year, and videos from BurningCon, and videos from the New York Comic Con, and basically the Geek Nights Rim YouTube channel has a fuck ton of videos of stuff that we have done.

400
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,944
Speaker 1: So Scott, what was the last game that you 100 percented?

401
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:53,028
Speaker 1: As in- Like, actually, really, 100 percented.

402
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:59,809
Speaker 0: Like, I got every single thing there was in the game to get- There is nothing left in that game for you to do.

403
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,690
Speaker 0: I can't even remember if I've ever- That is a tracked thing.

404
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,530
Speaker 0: I mean, I know I have 100 percent- I gotta go back to the- it's like I have to work my way forward, right?

405
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:07,812
Speaker 0: It's like.

406
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:11,110
Speaker 0: I know I 100 percented Mega Man 2.

407
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,250
Speaker 1: I did a Zelda 1 first quest.

408
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,810
Speaker 0: I know I have 100 percented Zelda 1.

409
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:23,430
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I 100 percented Zelda 1 second quest, but back then there weren't, you know, percent indicators, nor were there achievements.

410
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,045
Speaker 1: I have- I don't know if I got every "show me the door" charge or not.

411
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:27,890
Speaker 1: I assume I did.

412
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,514
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

413
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:29,220
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

414
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:30,270
Speaker 0: I don't know if that counts.

415
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have not 100 percented Super Metroid or any Castlevania or anything like that.

416
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:42,750
Speaker 1: I- well, see, it's tricky because 100 percenting has- I 100 percented Pokemon Red.

417
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:48,530
Speaker 0: I caught all the Pokemons because my brother had Pokemon Blue and we were able to do it.

418
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:54,250
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 1, 4, and 6.

419
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,770
Speaker 1: As in, I leveled up Rydia until she had Media.

420
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:03,490
Speaker 1: I also got all the, you know, broken, weird summons that you can get in the US version of the game.

421
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,209
Speaker 0: Pokemon Red, since then?

422
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:19,550
Speaker 0: I 100 percented Advance Wars, Advance Wars 2, Advance Wars DS, I 100 percented Mario Kart, Mario Kart Super Circuit, Mario Tennis 4, the Game Cube.

423
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:36,270
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny because I would say that I 100 percented Castlevania DS, the first Castlevania on the DS, but while I did get all the items in the game, I don't think I actually got- I don't know if I got, like, every monster.

424
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,810
Speaker 1: Like, I think there are some things I didn't actually get.

425
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,770
Speaker 0: I did all the Phoenix Wright games, except for the Edgeworth one.

426
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:44,590
Speaker 1: So, what does the 100 percenting actually mean?

427
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,426
Speaker 1: Because in the past, there was no way to know.

428
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,390
Speaker 1: There wasn't, like, an indicator.

429
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,850
Speaker 0: Well, Super Metroid, I think, was perhaps the first game with an indicator, I'm guessing.

430
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,850
Speaker 1: Yup, it just told you, you know, did you get everything or not?

431
00:23:56,211 --> 00:24:00,870
Speaker 0: Right, because, I mean, you could beat the game without getting, say, all the energy packs, right?

432
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:05,510
Speaker 1: Now, Doom 2 had the percent meter where it'd tell you whether or not you got all the secrets.

433
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,042
Speaker 0: Doom 1 had that, too.

434
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:07,910
Speaker 0: Wolfenstein had that.

435
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:09,429
Speaker 1: Oh, I 100 percented both Dooms.

436
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,439
Speaker 0: Wolfenstein 3D.

437
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:13,170
Speaker 1: I did not 100 percent Final Doom or any of the other Dooms.

438
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,834
Speaker 0: Wait, did you really 100 percent?

439
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:16,870
Speaker 0: Doom, as in kill every bad guy, get every item, get every secret?

440
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,233
Speaker 1: As in every level.

441
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:23,290
Speaker 1: I beat every level of Doom 2 in Ultra-Violence, getting 100 percent on all the indicators.

442
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,590
Speaker 0: All three indicators, 100 percent, every single level?

443
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:25,821
Speaker 0: Yeah.

444
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,506
Speaker 0: Really?

445
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:33,150
Speaker 0: That means you killed every bad guy, and you got every item, and you opened every secret.

446
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,659
Speaker 1: Ever living fuck out of Doom 2.

447
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:39,128
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand how much of my life is dedicated- That's a little hard to believe.

448
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,891
Speaker 1: Scott, remember when we played Deathmatch in Doom 2?

449
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,950
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, it's hard to believe that you actually 100 percented all three categories in all the levels.

450
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,309
Speaker 0: It's easy to believe you beat all the levels, and that you maybe even got all the secrets.

451
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:57,750
Speaker 0: There may have been a level or two where- But to kill all the bad guys in every one of those levels- There may have been a level or two where it was actually impossible to do the 100 percent.

452
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,727
Speaker 1: I don't remember if that was true or not, because it's been-.

453
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, is there enough ammo to kill all those guys?

454
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:03,429
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, trivially.

455
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:04,527
Speaker 0: I don't know.

456
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,650
Speaker 1: Scott, you realize I pretty much used the single shotgun through most of the game on most of the bad guys.

457
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,890
Speaker 0: Well, of course, that's what you use, period, in the game, no matter what.

458
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,850
Speaker 1: I also used the chainsaw a lot, because on cacodemons it worked pretty well.

459
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,890
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I guess there is always enough ammo if you use the chainsaw.

460
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you forget to pick it up like a dumbass.

461
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:26,450
Speaker 0: It's like, you could even use theoretically, you could use the fist, and you could have enough ammo to beat the whole game.

462
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,730
Speaker 1: Scott, I got bored enough to where I made custom levels with like five cyberdemons and killed them with fists.

463
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:33,410
Speaker 0: I've killed a single cyberdemon with the fist.

464
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,210
Speaker 1: You had the rage power up though, didn't you?

465
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:41,870
Speaker 0: I don't know, I just run around behind him, punch him in the back till he turned around, and then run away and then get him in the back again.

466
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:44,770
Speaker 0: And keep doing that for a long fucking time.

467
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:45,590
Speaker 0: Doom 2.

468
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:51,510
Speaker 0: And you just dodge a lot, spend most of your time dodging rockets, 99% of the time dodging rockets, and 1% of the time punching him.

469
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,690
Speaker 1: Yep, Doom 2 feels way more difficult than it is.

470
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,629
Speaker 1: But anyway, I digress.

471
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,525
Speaker 1: I don't think Doom 2 100%ing was nearly as difficult as Advance Wars 1 100%ing.

472
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,049
Speaker 1: I mean, beating an Advance campaign with a perfect score.

473
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,021
Speaker 0: I didn't beat Advance Wars 1 on regular campaigns.

474
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:09,130
Speaker 0: I think I actually did eventually do that.

475
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,550
Speaker 1: I don't remember if it was the second to last, or the last mission of the Advance campaign.

476
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,350
Speaker 1: And remember, you had to beat the regular campaign with different directions and different decisions in order to get different characters.

477
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't even beat the fucking owl in the other ones.

478
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,770
Speaker 1: But it came down to, you had to move this transport with an inventory in it.

479
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,270
Speaker 1: I think you had one or two transport choppers with inventory, and there's nothing but fighter jets.

480
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:36,670
Speaker 1: You had to move every round the exact right position, with every single one of your units, every round.

481
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,160
Speaker 1: One mistake, game over.

482
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,310
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get the perfect score.

483
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,305
Speaker 0: Yep, 'cause that jet's gonna squ- boom!

484
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:41,829
Speaker 0: That's it.

485
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,489
Speaker 1: I don't know what possessed me to do that.

486
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:44,790
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

487
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,271
Speaker 1: Yeah.

488
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:46,982
Speaker 1: But, uh, so what's the deal?

489
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,686
Speaker 1: Why don't we 100% games anymore?

490
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,149
Speaker 0: 'Cause it's not worth the fucking time.

491
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,150
Speaker 1: So why was it ever worth the time?

492
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,089
Speaker 0: 'Cause we had a shit ton of free time and nothing to do.

493
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,647
Speaker 1: Is that really it, or has the bar been moved in terms of what constitutes 100%ing?

494
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,354
Speaker 0: Well, I think both, right?

495
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:00,458
Speaker 0: So on the one hand, right?

496
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:04,250
Speaker 0: Take, for example, a game- you know, back in the day, I had time to beat a game.

497
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,755
Speaker 0: Such as, you know, a Zelda.

498
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:09,990
Speaker 0: But, because I had lots of free time, I didn't just rush for the Triforce.

499
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,870
Speaker 0: I would go around to, you know, and bomb all the walls in the dungeon, looking for goodies.

500
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,610
Speaker 0: 'Cause I had time, and I didn't have money to buy so many more games.

501
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,950
Speaker 0: So if I stopped playing that game, what other games were there?

502
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,110
Speaker 0: Well, there were a bunch of games that I also had played a bunch, and I wasn't getting new games constantly.

503
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,530
Speaker 0: I didn't have so many games in a bundle that I couldn't even play them all.

504
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,260
Speaker 0: So, you were gonna play the games that you had more.

505
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,970
Speaker 0: You were gonna go back to the bin and play a game you beat again.

506
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:38,730
Speaker 0: And if you were gonna play a game you've already beaten, to get more entertainment out of it, you're gonna start poking around.

507
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:41,455
Speaker 0: In addition to that, right?

508
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:46,370
Speaker 0: You have the fact that, you know, if you're 100%ing, say, something like Super Metroid, right?

509
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:56,970
Speaker 0: All the stuff that you would get by getting 100% was missile packs, energy packs, things that actually, you know, improved.

510
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,050
Speaker 0: You know, things that you wanted to get anyway.

511
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:05,150
Speaker 0: You know, even Pokemon, which 100%, you know, it's like, well, you know, you caught Pokemon.

512
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,530
Speaker 0: You were actually doing something for the game.

513
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,942
Speaker 1: I think you're onto something, because I feel like a lot of the 100%ing kind of meta.

514
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:14,890
Speaker 1: motivations in gamers today are just that.

515
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,552
Speaker 1: They're meta.

516
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:16,958
Speaker 1: They're not direct to the game.

517
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,789
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, you got a thousand Baphomet dads throughout the game.

518
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:20,010
Speaker 0: Good job.

519
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,037
Speaker 0: Well, the perfect example is Super Smash Brothers.

520
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,790
Speaker 0: Congratulations, you collected all the little action figures for the gallery.

521
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,093
Speaker 1: Yup, or Minish Cap.

522
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:31,410
Speaker 1: Well, you used those shells to use the slot machine to get all the whatever the fuck they were.

523
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,090
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, that shit just doesn't mean anything.

524
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,750
Speaker 0: Now, in Super Smash Brothers, of course, you're gonna unlock all the maps and you're gonna unlock all the characters.

525
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:42,810
Speaker 0: And maybe even, you know, things that matter, all the items and stuff like that.

526
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,790
Speaker 0: But why unlock the stupid action figures if you have better shit to do?

527
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:51,890
Speaker 1: There was a time when 100%ing, even games that tracked it, that was all that mattered.

528
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,716
Speaker 1: There weren't so many meta things.

529
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:58,010
Speaker 1: Maybe there was, like, the one weird thing, like, find the item that doesn't do anything.

530
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:04,010
Speaker 0: My actual earliest memories of games that did this sort of thing were a lot of the early Game Boy Color games.

531
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:12,375
Speaker 0: Like, you look at something like Game & Watch Gallery, or even, I think, Super Mario Brothers Deluxe for the Game Boy Color, which is one of the best releases of Mario Brothers.

532
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:18,670
Speaker 0: there ever was, had, like, this stuff that you could, like, collect for Mario and shit.

533
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,450
Speaker 0: Like, you know, I think if you had, like, a Game Boy Printer, you could print out different stickers you collected and unlocked.

534
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:31,610
Speaker 0: It just had some shit like that in there, and it's, like, you had to beat levels collecting the coin, and it's, like, why even bother?

535
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,586
Speaker 0: It's, like, you beat the game, you play all the levels, you know, collecting all the coins, what does it get you?

536
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,790
Speaker 0: Some pictures show up?

537
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,274
Speaker 0: It's, like, what do I need these pictures for?

538
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,781
Speaker 0: I can go online and look at the pictures.

539
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:44,870
Speaker 0: Why do I need to spend my time unlocking useless pictures in a game?

540
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:53,490
Speaker 1: Yup, because when I think about it, every game I've 100%ed, it has been a game where I got some, like, contextual reward for doing that in the game.

541
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:55,750
Speaker 1: Like, I've got some power armor now or something.

542
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:56,228
Speaker 0: Yup.

543
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:04,190
Speaker 1: And it was also usually not a, like, the game wouldn't say, "Oh shit, you 100%ed me, I just kind of knew that I've got, like, the biggest, baddest

544
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,330
Speaker 1: thing.".

545
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,894
Speaker 1: Like, in Castlevania DS.

546
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:17,854
Speaker 1: I don't know if I actually 100%ed the game, I have to go take my DS card, I don't even know if I have it anymore or if I gave it to someone or whatever, but, uh, when I got Death's Axe, like, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

547
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:19,075
Speaker 0: the, the, the, the, the,

548
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:25,099
Speaker 1: the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

549
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:25,619
Speaker 0: the, the,

550
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:33,044
Speaker 1: the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

551
00:30:33,064 --> 00:31:00,410
Speaker 0: the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

552
00:31:29,030 --> 00:33:31,391
Speaker 1: the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

553
00:33:47,630 --> 00:34:18,431
Speaker 0: the, the, the, the, the, the, the

554
00:35:01,694 --> 00:36:16,231
Speaker 1: the, the, the, the, the, the the, the, the the, the the the the

555
00:36:46,190 --> 00:37:16,572
Speaker 0: the the

556
00:37:46,170 --> 00:39:16,591
Speaker 1: the the the the

557
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:46,334
Speaker 0: the

558
00:40:16,454 --> 00:40:46,452
Speaker 1: the the

559
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:46,371
Speaker 0: the the

560
00:42:16,270 --> 00:45:46,230
Speaker 1: the the the the the the the the

561
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:16,230
Speaker 0: the

562
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:46,331
Speaker 1: the

563
00:47:16,190 --> 00:48:16,250
Speaker 0: the the the

564
00:48:46,190 --> 00:49:16,252
Speaker 1: the the

565
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:51,812
Speaker 0: the.
