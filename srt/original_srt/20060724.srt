1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,390
Speaker 1: It's Monday July 24th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,520
Speaker 1: Tonight, we talk about the lies in consumer electronics.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,437
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,499
Speaker 0: So now moments before the show, we concluded that the reason the middle class can't live in modern cities is because of the second law of thermodynamics.

5
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,227
Speaker 1: That is absolutely true.

6
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:37,500
Speaker 1: If the second law of thermodynamics was breakable, then middle-class people would be able to live in New York City just fine.

7
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:45,737
Speaker 0: Now that might sound odd, but I guess we threw that out because when we came to that conclusion, which was actually a valid conclusion, that is actually the argument we had.

8
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:46,360
Speaker 0: We're not kidding.

9
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:54,060
Speaker 0: That's the kind of crap we argue about, and those are the kind of conclusions we come to, and that was a at least hour-and-a-half argument.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,417
Speaker 1: Well, you know, just to give everyone some clarification in case they're going,

11
00:00:58,477 --> 00:00:59,140
Speaker 1: "Hwah-hwah-hwah?".

12
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:09,660
Speaker 1: We started out talking about, you know, there's some article saying, you know, middle-class people have a hard time living in cities because it's great for poor people to live in cities.

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:21,480
Speaker 1: At least it's better for poor--if you're a poor person, it's better to live in a city where there's a lot of low-paying jobs and, you know, some kind of slum to live in than it is to live in a suburb where it just sucks if you're poor.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,140
Speaker 0: Yet if you're a rich person, it's also great to live in the city because there's a lot more to do with your money.

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:37,179
Speaker 1: And you can live in some luxury penthouse, and there's all sorts of office buildings, and you can hobnob with all kinds of, you know, fancy people, and, you know, they're making TV shows there, and--.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,960
Speaker 0: But gentrification is slowly pushing middle-class people out of all the cities in the world.

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Speaker 0: Not just New York City, but every major city in the world in an industrialized nation is having this problem.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if you're a middle-class person, you can't live in a slum or anything.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,609
Speaker 1: That's, you know, you make more money than that.

20
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,540
Speaker 1: Why would you live in such a degrading place?

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:04,940
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you know, you want to live in the city for its conveniences, but you can't-- any place that's actually nice, you can't afford because you're not rich.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:16,980
Speaker 0: I mean, we're middle-class, and it cost us quite a bit of money to commute as far as we do, but to move that much closer to New York City would cost far more than commuting costs, even with gas prices.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:17,752
Speaker 1: Yep.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,640
Speaker 1: So, of course, the way to solve this is to, like, build a lot more places to live very rapidly, so-and-so on resources, so-and-so on thermodynamics.

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,022
Speaker 0: Yep.

26
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:30,485
Speaker 0: We even got to the old Dubai hypothesis/theory.

27
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:33,560
Speaker 0: that is somewhat dubious and long-term, but it was relevant to the discussion.

28
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:34,665
Speaker 1: Yep.

29
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,979
Speaker 1: So, there you have it.

30
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,200
Speaker 0: We thought that was odd enough.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,779
Speaker 1: If you could somehow take, like, a piece of coal and get, like, a million frickin' electricities out of it.

32
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:45,839
Speaker 1: In no scientific terms.

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:56,800
Speaker 0: Now, also, all of you who read the forums regularly saw this already, but our good friend Ido came out over the weekend, and she and I went exploring abandoned buildings at great personal risk.

34
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:09,520
Speaker 0: So, if you were at all interested in urban exploration or pictures of us inside of rickety old mills built at the turn of the century, or on the roofs of old brick foundries that are barely held together, there are some fantastic pictures linked to in the forum.

35
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:10,727
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

36
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:15,133
Speaker 0: The best part was, as we were leaving the mill, the floor started collapsing under us.

37
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,157
Speaker 0: Hey, I survived.

38
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,120
Speaker 0: I'm happy.

39
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:25,160
Speaker 1: You could- I survived also, and I'm also happy, sitting safe at home in my non-rickety house.

40
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but you didn't get to see a place where a hobo may or may not have slept.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,513
Speaker 1: I saw a picture of a place where a hobo may or may not have slept.

42
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:33,096
Speaker 0: True, you did.

43
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:33,980
Speaker 1: So, what?

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,624
Speaker 0: You didn't get to- what did I lose?

45
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:42,040
Speaker 0: You didn't get to stick your hand into a giant old coal-fired boiler, wondering if there is any horrible animal in there that was going to maul you.

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,404
Speaker 1: So, you're saying I lucked out.

47
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,749
Speaker 1: Which is- I agree.

48
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,334
Speaker 1: I also- I think I lucked out.

49
00:03:47,755 --> 00:04:05,119
Speaker 0: Anyway, also from the forums, we have had a lot of feedback as to the possible minor format changes to Geek Nights that we've been mauling over, and we're not gonna really talk about it a lot today, but we're going to be subtly changing the show over the course of the week and trying different things, and we're- we've taken all of your input seriously.

50
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:14,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you care about the format of this show, you should join our forum and talk it up, because if you don't say anything, we don't know what you want.

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:23,316
Speaker 1: So, if you're like, "Oh, they stopped doing my favorite part of the show, or they moved something to the end, and now I don't like the show anymore," well, you know, we- we're gonna change it back.

52
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:23,939
Speaker 1: Just tell us.

53
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:24,678
Speaker 1: Yep.

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,092
Speaker 1: Don't run away and say, "Ah, it

55
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:26,416
Speaker 1: sucks.".

56
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:34,547
Speaker 0: The only real question I have to ask all of you right now, because this is something that is part of all the discussions we've been having, where should the things of the day go?

57
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,760
Speaker 0: Do you like them where they are, or do you want them at the end of the show?

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,186
Speaker 0: I'm just asking that question.

59
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:42,060
Speaker 0: I want your feedback before I say what I think.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we do it one segment at a time, then I think that we can pretty much get the format down.

61
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,480
Speaker 1: So, do you even want things of the day to stick around?

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how many of you actually click the links, because I don't look at those stats, and they're not that easy to find out at all.

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you like things of the day?

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,748
Speaker 1: Do you want them, or are you better off without them?

65
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,720
Speaker 1: And if we have them, where in the show should they go?

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:12,000
Speaker 0: But anyway, we'll break away from that right now, and we won't even have a Geekbag today, because we have a big news, and we really don't want to do this one short.

67
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,454
Speaker 1: Now- I'm reading, uh, what's it called?

68
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:17,260
Speaker 1: News Alert.

69
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:27,900
Speaker 0: This is something we talked about at least once a while ago, when it was a rumor, and I'm pretty sure I said that I didn't think this would ever come to pass, and I gave a lot of reasons.

70
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,093
Speaker 1: And I said, "Eh, it seems kinda reliable, though.

71
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,520
Speaker 1: It's from a kinda reliable source,

72
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:32,580
Speaker 1: eh.".

73
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,424
Speaker 0: See, that's what bugged me.

74
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:37,120
Speaker 0: It was from a reliable source, but at the same time, it seemed ludicrous and crazy.

75
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:43,280
Speaker 1: And the rumor just didn't die until today, when it came back from the dead.

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,360
Speaker 1: Oh, holy crap.

77
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,800
Speaker 1: And it is actually real and true.

78
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Speaker 0: So, AMD, the people who make all the "good" chips, though actually lately Intel has been catching up.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,700
Speaker 1: Intel has been making a lot of good chips, but the, you know, AMD, the people who make the cost-effective chips for PCs.

80
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,002
Speaker 0: Well, let's put it this way.

81
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:06,700
Speaker 0: Up until about the year 2002, AMD was the undisputed champion of chips that were not overpriced.

82
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,746
Speaker 0: Like, there was no question.

83
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:12,060
Speaker 0: Any nerd, unless they had infinite money, would buy an AMD chip.

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,957
Speaker 1: No, it was pretty much until very recently, like within the past year or two, that when the newer...

85
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,915
Speaker 0: I threw out an arbitrary year.

86
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:19,300
Speaker 0: What do you want?

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,760
Speaker 1: I'd say since the Pentium M came out is when Intel has been slowly catching up.

88
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,851
Speaker 1: Before then, Intel was definitely not up to par.

89
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:30,420
Speaker 1: 'Cause the Pentium 4 is just, whoa, crap.

90
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least the Pentium M had a lot of advantages.

91
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:46,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the Pentium M wasn't really... It was lower-powered, but it's when they started getting the architecture design corrected from being the over-crazy monster that the Pentium 4 was.

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,029
Speaker 0: Yep.

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:58,739
Speaker 1: You know, I think I heard somewhere that the new Pentium chips, like the new fast ones, like the one we have in our Mac Mini, are more akin to Pentium 3s than Pentium 4s.

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,491
Speaker 1: It's just, they figured out how to make them better.

95
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,180
Speaker 1: Some guys in Israel did it all.

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Speaker 0: But anyway, AMD, that we talked about briefly now, has bought ATI, who are pretty much right neck-and-neck with Nvidia for the video card and, to a lesser extent, the chipset markets.

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,027
Speaker 1: Yep, and I think that, you know, there have been so many news sources covering this.

98
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,072
Speaker 1: You know, they've said everything there is to say.

99
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:25,400
Speaker 1: Except, from our point of view, they haven't said everything there is to say.

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,369
Speaker 0: Yes, and we have two very important points of view.

101
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,980
Speaker 0: The point of view of the PC gamer and the point of view of the technologist.

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,679
Speaker 1: And the point of view of the Linux guys.

103
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,202
Speaker 0: Linux is key here.

104
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:43,493
Speaker 0: Now, we really don't want to cover exactly all the technical stuff because, like Scott said, that's everywhere.

105
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:47,580
Speaker 0: But very briefly, AMD makes processors and Intel makes processors.

106
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:55,660
Speaker 0: They are compatible with each other in terms of the instructions they use and how they work as processors, but they're completely different architectures to a degree.

107
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,259
Speaker 1: You need different motherboards.

108
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,220
Speaker 0: Now, motherboards have a chipset, which is basically the chips that sit around the processor and control everything on the motherboard.

109
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Speaker 1: So, they're just motherboard chips, if you don't understand what we're talking about.

110
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, so think about, we have people who make processors and people who make motherboards, and you need one of each to have a computer.

111
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you also need a video card.

112
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,774
Speaker 0: Now, ATI and Nvidia also made video cards.

113
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:20,160
Speaker 0: In fact, that was their primary business.

114
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,427
Speaker 1: Well, they make the video card chips.

115
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,700
Speaker 1: They don't make the video- ATI actually does make the video cards.

116
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to get specific about that, I mean, I bought a Creative Graphics Blaster Extreme that had an Intel- no, it had an Nvidia chip on it.

117
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,020
Speaker 0: Actually, the Graphics Blaster Extreme didn't.

118
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,600
Speaker 2: Really?

119
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:34,491
Speaker 0: I forget what it had.

120
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,080
Speaker 0: It was something weird.

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,496
Speaker 2: Whatever.

122
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,740
Speaker 0: The GeForce 2 GTS had an Nvidia chip.

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,195
Speaker 1: Yes.

124
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,905
Speaker 0: But anyway, none of you care about that.

125
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:43,860
Speaker 0: Just pretend they make video cards because that makes this easier.

126
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,188
Speaker 2: Yep.

127
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:53,920
Speaker 0: Now, it used to be that Intel and ATI chips seemed to go together, at least from my perspective.

128
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:02,520
Speaker 2: No, it was more like, um, the, uh, how can I explain this, they don't really go together in any particular way.

129
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,760
Speaker 0: Well, it seemed that people who bought Intel chips tended to have ATI video cards, and the people who bought AMD chips tended to have N-Force chipsets and Nvidia cards.

130
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:20,420
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't really notice that so much, but, uh, the Intel tended to always be the chip where if you wanted the fastest thing in the universe, you could pay a lot of money and get it.

131
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:28,380
Speaker 2: And ATI, you know, in terms of power of the chips, you know, seemed to actually compete pretty well with Nvidia.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,880
Speaker 2: It's just they didn't compete so well on the, you know, awesome drivers, compatibility, stability, and Linux support.

133
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, consider this.

134
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:39,063
Speaker 0: There's another whole thing here.

135
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:47,533
Speaker 0: You have the video cards, you have the chipsets, you have the CPUs, and then for the video cards and sometimes the chipsets, you have a driver, which is the software.

136
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,840
Speaker 0: that's between the hardware itself and you, the user, your computer.

137
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,740
Speaker 0: Now, Windows, this isn't much of an issue because they make proprietary drivers for both ATI and Nvidia chips for Windows.

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:13,240
Speaker 0: For Linux, it's a whole other story because Nvidia very, very openly embraced Linux, and while they didn't give a completely open-source driver, they made it very easy to use Nvidia chips in Linux.

139
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,220
Speaker 0: And in fact, the drivers that existed in Linux worked very, very well, and it's very easy to make an Nvidia chip do what you want.

140
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,300
Speaker 2: Yeah, and people who are using ATI on Linux have big problems.

141
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:26,609
Speaker 0: Now, ATI has terrible drivers, even in Windows.

142
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,960
Speaker 0: They've gotten better over the last few years, but they have a reputation for having just terrible drivers.

143
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,782
Speaker 2: Yep, they're just, they're ass.

144
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:42,720
Speaker 2: It's hard to, unless you're using an ATI card for gaming on Windows, it's really hard to make it do what you want, and it can even be unpleasant in Windows.

145
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:46,090
Speaker 0: Think of this, the cards were pretty much technologically equal.

146
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,680
Speaker 0: I mean, ATI video cards were very powerful, and so were Nvidia cards.

147
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,265
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of that potential in.

148
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:57,900
Speaker 0: ATI cards was underutilized because the drivers just were so inefficient and bloated and terrible.

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:10,040
Speaker 2: Right, so right now, you know, I, you know, up until today, I've been of the mind that if I'm gonna buy a computer, I'm gonna buy an AMD chip because it is the least money for the most power.

150
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:18,380
Speaker 2: I'm going to get an Nvidia graphics card because it works with Linux, and I'm going to get the Nvidia chipset on the motherboard.

151
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,200
Speaker 0: Called N-Force.

152
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,760
Speaker 2: Called N-Force because it works the best with the Nvidia graphics card, and it's also really, really good.

153
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,800
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, the N-Force chipset, when it first came out, when Nvidia, you know, announced this whole thing.

154
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,240
Speaker 2: N-Force 1, well, when it first came out, the existing market dominators were what, VIA?

155
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, VIA, VIA.

156
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:46,980
Speaker 2: Yeah, whatever you want to call them, and they're still around doing their thing, but seriously, Nvidia with the N-Force 2, which is what I have on my computer right now.

157
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:54,780
Speaker 2: Now they have the N-Force, like, 500 series or something, and the N-Force 4, and it totally blows out the VIA out of the water.

158
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,520
Speaker 0: Even in VIA's heyday, the chipsets were only good because we didn't have anything better to compare them to.

159
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:08,480
Speaker 2: Yeah, because Intel makes their own chipsets, so you can get an Intel motherboard, you know, with an Intel chipset and an Intel CPU on it.

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,440
Speaker 2: If you want an AMD CPU, you need to get the chipset from someone else, you need to get a chipset from Nvidia.

161
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 0: I mean, there were, before N-Force, there were a bunch of chipsets, but VIA had the most features, but at the same time, it was somewhat unstable and buggy.

162
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,660
Speaker 2: Yeah, the N-Force is like, shit awesome.

163
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,971
Speaker 0: Even though when N-Force was announced, most people laughed at it.

164
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,957
Speaker 0: Why is Nvidia trying to make a chipset?

165
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:31,680
Speaker 0: This is going to be silly.

166
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,149
Speaker 2: Yeah, at first I was like, what are they doing making a chipset?

167
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,920
Speaker 2: Then I was like, whoa, it works, and it made it to version 2, let me buy one.

168
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,394
Speaker 0: Yep.

169
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,115
Speaker 2: It was like, I don't think this is going to work, but if it does, it'll be awesome.

170
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:41,940
Speaker 2: And it was.

171
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:51,660
Speaker 0: Now there's also the whole bit that Nvidia very much is behind OpenGL, which, think of this as a way to talk to the video card to make it do things.

172
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:57,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're trying to be really lame in here, because anyone who actually knows this stuff doesn't need us to explain it.

173
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Speaker 0: And ATI, instead of OpenGL, which they do support, they're very much more behind Microsoft's DirectX.

174
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,309
Speaker 2: Well, they're not, it's not really a matter behind.

175
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,740
Speaker 2: I mean, either one of those things will work on both cards.

176
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:17,940
Speaker 2: The point is, is that things that use OpenGL tend to perform better on Nvidia cards, and things that use DirectX tend to perform better on ATI cards.

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,380
Speaker 0: Think of it this way, like, ATI will, when they make their card, they always think about the DirectX more than they think about the OpenGL.

178
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,720
Speaker 2: I think it's more that they had to deal with Valve when they made Half-Life 2 to make Half-Life 2 run better on the ATI cards with DirectX.

179
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:53,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus there were scandals back in the day, like, it used to be with Quake and Quake 2 and Quake 3, and there were all these sorts of scandals where, if you ran Quake.execute, the game would run a certain way, but if you renamed the executable and ran it, it would run slower, because there were hard-coded things and drivers that would make certain games perform different ways in order to cheat on benchmarks.

180
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,319
Speaker 0: And both companies were guilty of this.

181
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,940
Speaker 2: Yeah, now anyway, the point is, is that in Linux you don't have DirectX, so, again, Nvidia wins on Linux.

182
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:16,860
Speaker 2: Now here's the thing, we like AMD chips, and we like Nvidia cards, but if AMD is buying ATI, which they are, then is Nvidia going to keep making its chipsets work with AMD CPUs?

183
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,620
Speaker 2: That's like making products that work with your competitor's product.

184
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
Speaker 0: Now Intel has already said that they're not going to be having anything to do with this.

185
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Speaker 2: Well, no, what Intel said is that, because right now ATI is making chipsets, motherboard chipsets, for Intel motherboards.

186
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,399
Speaker 0: Yes, and Intel granted them a license to do this.

187
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,033
Speaker 2: You can't just do that on your own.

188
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 2: Intel has to let you.

189
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,068
Speaker 0: Now the story on DIG was a little deceptive.

190
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,240
Speaker 0: They said that Intel revoked their right to make them.

191
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,760
Speaker 0: What Intel actually did is they chose not to renew the license.

192
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:55,900
Speaker 2: Yes, so AMD/ATI isn't going to be able to continue making chipsets for Intel motherboards.

193
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,600
Speaker 0: But there's one more chipset that was in the works, the RD600 or something, I have no idea what the acronym is.

194
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,179
Speaker 2: It'll get made.

195
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:08,499
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, people are wondering if it is going to get made or not, because it wasn't done, and they wonder if it's even worth it to finish it.

196
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:09,538
Speaker 2: Oh, who knows.

197
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:10,624
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

198
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,420
Speaker 0: I didn't actually read much about that, but I saw a reference to it.

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,940
Speaker 2: So the thing here that is being suspected is, okay, the gamers and Linux guys really like Nvidia.

200
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,308
Speaker 2: Most people don't care.

201
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:22,840
Speaker 2: But we also like AMD.

202
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:29,160
Speaker 2: Are we going to see ATI become as good as AMD is because of the partnership?

203
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,319
Speaker 2: Are we going to see AMD start to suck?

204
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,579
Speaker 2: Intel right now is doing a lot better than it used to.

205
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,515
Speaker 2: A few years ago I'd have been like, "Intel,

206
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:38,019
Speaker 2: eh.".

207
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,840
Speaker 0: There was a point not too many years ago in which Intel was actually getting near bankruptcy.

208
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,158
Speaker 0: They were not doing well at all.

209
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,800
Speaker 2: They weren't near bankruptcy, but they weren't doing as well.

210
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
Speaker 0: Profits were way down, their stock was dropping, they were having a lot of trouble.

211
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,259
Speaker 2: They just weren't growing as fast as they did in the Pentium 1, 2, 3 days when they were the kings, and AMD was barely there.

212
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:03,320
Speaker 0: It didn't help that their chips cost two or three times more than equivalent AMD chips, at the height of the price gap.

213
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Speaker 2: But now Intel is back on track with its core 2s, and they're going to come out with the core 2-2s, duos.

214
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess the question for me will be price.

215
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:29,880
Speaker 0: I mean, if Intel chips become as cheap as AMD chips, and they are super in line with Nvidia, I might switch to Intel, which is a chip that I-- I used an Intel chip on purpose until I bought the Mac Mini.

216
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,760
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, here's the thing, is like, will Nvidia even care?

217
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:50,820
Speaker 2: I mean, Nvidia might just keep supporting, you know, the AMD line as it is, and, you know, gamers are the people buying Nvidia stuff, so will they continue to buy Nvidia AMD, even though AMD ATI will basically be the same company and do evil things together?

218
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,307
Speaker 0: See, I really-- I wonder.

219
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,340
Speaker 0: I mean, it's really hard to say what's going to happen.

220
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:59,500
Speaker 2: And what people are saying now is that, you know, people are putting more and more stuff into the CPU.

221
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:06,359
Speaker 2: You know, back in the day, you know, the math coprocessor used to be outside the CPU, now they put it in the CPU.

222
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,520
Speaker 2: The cache used to be outside the CPU, now it's inside the CPU.

223
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:16,180
Speaker 0: Yep, in fact, my 486, I had a 486 on it, and then I bought a math coprocessor and stuck it on the motherboard.

224
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,848
Speaker 2: Yep, back in the day, it had two processors.

225
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,920
Speaker 2: Now you have two processors in, one processor with a dual core.

226
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:32,048
Speaker 2: If AMD and ATI are the same company, are they just going to put the ATI graphics processor in the CPU instead of putting it into the Northbridge?

227
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,840
Speaker 2: If that happens, then what's Nvidia going to do?

228
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,300
Speaker 2: You're going to buy your chip, it's going to have a graphics processor in it already, you don't need anything else.

229
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,267
Speaker 2: It won't need a video card.

230
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,459
Speaker 2: So, what's going to happen then?

231
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:53,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if AMD and ATI chipsets and video cards are all chummy chummy, maybe AMD will force ATI's drivers to not suck?

232
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:55,059
Speaker 2: I don't know.

233
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,040
Speaker 0: Will they even care?

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:14,160
Speaker 2: I don't know, and then here's the other question, is like, okay, if AMD is making CPUs that have ATI graphics cards in the CPU, if Intel and Nvidia don't partner up, how are they going to compete with the old, not as fast video cards separate from the CPU business?

235
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:24,780
Speaker 0: Unless maybe Nvidia will just go it alone, continue marketing chipsets and video cards to everybody, thus having their own kind of side market where they're not excluding anyone.

236
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,060
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess.

237
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,059
Speaker 0: But is that viable?

238
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,295
Speaker 2: I know, it's like, can you do that?

239
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:29,780
Speaker 2: Can you compete?

240
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,520
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's my opinion that they could, simply because among geeks, the names Nvidia and Enforce carry a lot of weight.

241
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:44,800
Speaker 2: Yeah, people all buy, you know, the gamers especially, Nvidia is, you know, definitely has edged out ATI over the years.

242
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone who builds computers, who builds their own computers, even if they don't use an Enforce, they know about it and respect it.

243
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:52,299
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

244
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:56,200
Speaker 2: I don't know, it's just, things are going to start to get crazy now.

245
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:06,640
Speaker 2: Where, you know, a week ago, it was just a sure thing, you know a computer to buy, you buy this motherboard that's awesome from Asus or Abit, you throw an AMD chip in it and you buy an Nvidia video card.

246
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:15,840
Speaker 2: Now, as, you know, now that this has happened, AMD and ATI becoming partners, everything is going to get crazy and we're not going to know what to do when we buy a computer.

247
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,440
Speaker 2: We're going to see how all this craziness pans out.

248
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:23,840
Speaker 0: Yep, because I was in the process of building a new computer, I was going to buy it within a few months and now I don't know what I'm going to do.

249
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,860
Speaker 0: I might hold off and wait for the dust to settle.

250
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:37,760
Speaker 2: I would actually recommend that right before, like right now the technology is still moving forward in the same direction and none of the effects of the merger have come to be.

251
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,840
Speaker 0: See, that's what I'm worried about because if I wait, then while I'm getting the new thing, it'll be the first gen of the new thing.

252
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:51,720
Speaker 2: I would recommend you wait right before, you know, just as motherboards and CPUs and graphics processors keep developing in the same direction.

253
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,438
Speaker 0: Buy the last AMD fastest chip on the best N4s?

254
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:05,760
Speaker 2: Yeah, right before, you know, the AMD and ATI partnership, the fruits of that partnership start to appear in products on the shelves, buy the best computer you can.

255
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:14,600
Speaker 2: That way, you know, because stuff that works now will continue to work now and the future stuff is going to take a whole long time to get sorted out.

256
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:22,100
Speaker 2: So right before the craziness happens, I suggest if you need a computer, you buy a good one now while everything works.

257
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:31,540
Speaker 0: Of course, if you can hold off, you wait until slightly after the craziness and then you buy the best of the previous generation right after it is no longer the best.

258
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:40,100
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the point is I wouldn't recommend, you know, I wouldn't recommend taking part in the fruits of this merger for a long time, years.

259
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:47,660
Speaker 0: Well, I would say just generally because I don't trust ATI at all, but I trust AMD a lot, but I distrust ATI so much.

260
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:55,460
Speaker 0: I really, I mean, you should have seen, we had a good ATI video card and we had a Linux box that we unhooked up to the TV.

261
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,438
Speaker 0: There was no way to make that ATI card output its S-video to our television in Linux.

262
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,240
Speaker 0: There was just no way.

263
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,983
Speaker 2: There was no way.

264
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:06,820
Speaker 2: The Nvidia card, we plugged it in, we plugged in the S-video cable.

265
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,791
Speaker 2: Immediately, the picture is on the screen without doing anything.

266
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:12,019
Speaker 2: The BIOS screen was on the TV.

267
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,190
Speaker 0: It was like a Mac.

268
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,000
Speaker 0: It was just beautiful.

269
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:17,719
Speaker 2: Yeah, so Nvidia makes the good stuff and ATI.

270
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Speaker 0: And the sad thing is, it's not like ATI, at least as far as we can tell, does it on purpose.

271
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,685
Speaker 0: It's not like they sit in their evil office.

272
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,673
Speaker 0: We will not let people use our things on Linux.

273
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,880
Speaker 0: They either just don't know or don't care.

274
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:35,020
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're pretty much, ATI is only trying to compete in one department.

275
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,608
Speaker 2: Make faster chips that do better.

276
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:40,940
Speaker 2: benchmarks with games on Windows and everything else is unimportant.

277
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,502
Speaker 2: And that's what they make.

278
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:49,240
Speaker 2: And as a result, it's not as well-rounded and solid a video card as Nvidia tends to be.

279
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,112
Speaker 0: Alright, here's a funny question that no one cares about or will answer.

280
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:53,479
Speaker 0: What's Matrox gonna do?

281
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:55,980
Speaker 2: The same thing it's been doing.

282
00:21:56,221 --> 00:22:00,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, make cards for very picky 2D people who don't care about gaming.

283
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,020
Speaker 2: And professionals.

284
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:01,560
Speaker 0: Yes.

285
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,579
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.

286
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,580
Speaker 0: Things of the day, which are still in the middle of the podcast.

287
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:15,479
Speaker 1: Hooray, we didn't lose our things.

288
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,051
Speaker 0: Not yet.

289
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:16,750
Speaker 1: Haha.

290
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,039
Speaker 0: Alright, this is something we found a while ago.

291
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,099
Speaker 1: Oh, Rym lost his thing.

292
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,113
Speaker 0: And we didn't use it because we kept having other things and it was so hilarious.

293
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,317
Speaker 0: We were kind of saving it.

294
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,060
Speaker 0: I'm not sure why.

295
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,720
Speaker 1: And if you're wondering why it's science technology, well, it's science.

296
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:30,900
Speaker 1: It's somewhat.

297
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:32,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, natural selection, nature.

298
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,040
Speaker 0: Theoretically, I should have used it tomorrow.

299
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,948
Speaker 0: But alright, this is a video.

300
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,820
Speaker 0: This monkey and these two baby tigers.

301
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,850
Speaker 1: Are they really baby tigers?

302
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:44,960
Speaker 1: They look like teenage tigers.

303
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,072
Speaker 0: They're very young tigers.

304
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:46,800
Speaker 0: They're very small.

305
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,694
Speaker 0: Now, the tigers are big enough to be dangerous.

306
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:51,800
Speaker 0: This monkey.

307
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of these tigers would maul you.

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, the tiger could kill me.

309
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:58,120
Speaker 0: And the tiger is sitting there and this monkey is hanging above him in a tree.

310
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,339
Speaker 1: The monkey could probably kill you too.

311
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:02,680
Speaker 0: And he leans down and he smacks one of them on the ass.

312
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,920
Speaker 0: And it goes oop and it tries to catch him and he jumps away.

313
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, the monkey basically swings down out at the tree, hits the tiger in the ass and is back up in the tree real quick like whoop.

314
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,060
Speaker 0: And then he sits up there looking at the tigers and then he swings a branch and hits him with the branch and then he jumps down and hits him again.

315
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Speaker 1: The monkey just keeps swinging down, hitting the tigers and swinging away.

316
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,159
Speaker 0: There's like five minutes of this.

317
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one point at which the tigers try to jump up and maul the monkey but they just missed him.

318
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:32,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the monkey is hanging just out of range and then he hits him in the face.

319
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,100
Speaker 0: And the best part is there's a point at which the tiger thinks it's clever and it's like hiding behind this tree nearby.

320
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:45,699
Speaker 0: And the monkey jumps down on the ground and looks right at where the tiger is hiding and just sits there waiting for the tiger to come out.

321
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,120
Speaker 1: Monkeys and other similar to human species, smarter than beeline species.

322
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:57,094
Speaker 0: Yes, this video is so worth watching.

323
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,319
Speaker 0: This monkey is my hero.

324
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:00,365
Speaker 1: You know why?

325
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,340
Speaker 1: The monkey is like braver than almost any human alive.

326
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:14,180
Speaker 1: I mean, even like a lion, tiger, tamer guy, you know, either they're like, you know, they have tigers that are tamed and won't try to maul you.

327
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,240
Speaker 0: Or they get mauled.

328
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,157
Speaker 1: Or they get mauled.

329
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,144
Speaker 0: But think of this, humans, right?

330
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:24,800
Speaker 0: A human will risk his life, you know, for love or liberty or land or money or women or something.

331
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,980
Speaker 0: This monkey is risking his life purely for his own amusement.

332
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,699
Speaker 1: And such a tiny bit of amusement, too.

333
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,319
Speaker 0: I don't know, the monkey looked really happy about all this.

334
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's just hitting a tiger in the face.

335
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then the tiger gets mad and tries to get you and you, oop, missed me.

336
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:43,660
Speaker 0: Jump back down him in the ass again.

337
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,619
Speaker 1: I mean, I could play that game with rim without risking my life.

338
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,099
Speaker 0: That's just because I don't have a big enough mouth.

339
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:49,838
Speaker 1: That's right.

340
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,339
Speaker 0: Alright, you have some sort of thing of the day.

341
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is technology.

342
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:58,960
Speaker 1: It's sort of a military technology for you military fanboys out there.

343
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,700
Speaker 0: Katsu will like this one.

344
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

345
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,565
Speaker 1: So they have this machine gun.

346
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:05,192
Speaker 1: Not like a submachine gun.

347
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,940
Speaker 1: Not like an M16, which is an assault rifle, I guess.

348
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:10,140
Speaker 1: But a machine gun.

349
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,379
Speaker 0: Like a Para.

350
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:15,351
Speaker 1: A .50 caliber, mounted on a tripod on the ground.

351
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,194
Speaker 1: machine gun.

352
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,320
Speaker 1: The kind you feed a chain of bullets into.

353
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,770
Speaker 1: And they have a katana.

354
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:23,760
Speaker 1: Like Leonardo from the Ninja Turtles.

355
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Speaker 0: A samurai sword.

356
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,519
Speaker 1: A samurai sword, yes, exactly.

357
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,039
Speaker 0: They mount this thing.

358
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,620
Speaker 1: They have the sword, like, basically mounted pointing straight up at the sky.

359
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,160
Speaker 1: So the edge, the sharp edge of the sword is pointed straight at the machine gun.

360
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,820
Speaker 1: Then they fire an entire chain of bullets out of this machine gun at the sword.

361
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,619
Speaker 1: So the bullets are heading directly at the pointy bit.

362
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,820
Speaker 0: Now it's interesting enough watching it in full speed, but then they do it in ultra slow motion.

363
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,795
Speaker 1: It's funny because you can hear the guy say "ultra slow motion

364
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:02,558
Speaker 1: camera.".

365
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,620
Speaker 1: Yes.

366
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:07,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, and basically they start counting off each bullet.

367
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,031
Speaker 1: They're like "Bullet number

368
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:09,718
Speaker 1: one!"

369
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,820
Speaker 1: And you see bullet number one come up to the sword, hit the sword, and get deflected.

370
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,719
Speaker 1: But it takes a big chunk out of the sword.

371
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,651
Speaker 1: Then they're like "Bullet number

372
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:18,913
Speaker 1: two!"

373
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,600
Speaker 1: And bullet number two comes at the sword.

374
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:23,179
Speaker 1: And it gets cut in half!

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,700
Speaker 0: Several of the bullets get cut directly in half.

376
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,020
Speaker 1: I think, how many bullets did it happen before the sword?

377
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:34,980
Speaker 1: I mean, they show you right at the beginning of the video that the sword does basically get grinded in half.

378
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,458
Speaker 1: The sword doesn't make it.

379
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,380
Speaker 0: It takes quite a few bullets, and it only breaks because eventually many of the bullets hit in the exact same spot over and over.

380
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:52,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, if all the bullets, the machine gun is set so precisely in place that the bullets all hit pretty much near the same area on the sword.

381
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,620
Speaker 1: If they were spread up more vertically and hit different parts of the sword, it might have lasted a lot longer.

382
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,940
Speaker 1: But it didn't, and the sword died.

383
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,720
Speaker 1: But it was still a pretty impressive fight for the sword.

384
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:13,360
Speaker 0: But anyway, it being Science and Technology Day, we are going to talk somewhat briefly, we'll see how long this takes, about technology lies.

385
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,580
Speaker 0: Now you might wonder what we mean by that, because there are a lot of lies in the science and technology world.

386
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,300
Speaker 1: Oh my god, are there so many lies.

387
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,599
Speaker 0: We're going to narrow it down to this one scenario and all of the related scenarios to it.

388
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,220
Speaker 1: It's mostly lies in consumer electronics, if you think about it.

389
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:38,520
Speaker 0: Now, you ever been to a Best Buy or Circuit City, and say you walk in and you want to buy, I don't know, a home stereo system, or a home theater, or a television, or a new computer.

390
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:48,575
Speaker 0: And, you know, you buy and it's got a good price, and then the salesman will always say something like, "You gotta have clean power coming into that thing, you need a good surge protector.

391
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:49,599
Speaker 0: I recommend

392
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:49,820
Speaker 0: this.".

393
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,449
Speaker 0: And they'll hand you some $70 power strip.

394
00:27:54,661 --> 00:28:01,020
Speaker 0: Or, to get the best video quality on your new HDTV, you need these monster optical digital cables.

395
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,342
Speaker 1: Yup.

396
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,460
Speaker 0: As opposed to these $5 completely identical digital optical cables.

397
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,340
Speaker 0: Digital, meaning there can't be any difference at all, no matter what, because it's digital.

398
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:13,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

399
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,259
Speaker 0: That's really what we want to talk about today.

400
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,260
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's start with the audio file lies.

401
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:26,880
Speaker 0: Alright, very briefly, um, audio files, now the word technically means something different, but what the word--?

402
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, the word audio file technically means, in dictionary-wise, someone who really likes audio.

403
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,171
Speaker 0: Now, if you really like audio, do not call yourself an audio file.

404
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,320
Speaker 0: That word has become something new.

405
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, just call yourself like a music lover or something.

406
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:49,780
Speaker 0: Audio files are people who will buy $4,000 power cables and claim they can hear the difference in the stereo they plug them into.

407
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:58,500
Speaker 1: They will buy vacuum tube amplifiers, which are the same power as, like, a cheap-ass amplifier from the store, because they claim that, you know, it sounds better.

408
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,980
Speaker 0: Well, actually, Scott, vacuum tube amplifiers do sound different, because the way-- They sound different, but do they sound better?

409
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 0: Well, they could sound better, but they don't reproduce the sound accurately.

410
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,700
Speaker 1: But could you make an amplifier that sounds just as good as a vacuum tube amplifier without vacuum tubes?

411
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,960
Speaker 0: Yes, you could make a digital amplifier that sounds identical to an analog amplifier.

412
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,120
Speaker 1: And would it, um, be cheaper?

413
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,698
Speaker 0: Uh, significantly so.

414
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,040
Speaker 1: Ah, so why would you ever buy a vacuum tube amplifier?

415
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:24,740
Speaker 0: Uh, because you're an idiot.

416
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:26,925
Speaker 0: Oh!

417
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:30,116
Speaker 1: Oh, and it-- or, there's another reason, if the year was, like, 1960 or 50-something.

418
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,022
Speaker 1: Or '58.

419
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,800
Speaker 1: And you would also buy a vacuum tube amplifier.

420
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:38,186
Speaker 0: Now, let's look at TVs.

421
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:43,120
Speaker 0: You know, component cables that use to connect, like, your old non-HD DVD player to your nice non-HD TV.

422
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,060
Speaker 0: There is the $5 component cable from, like, some random company.

423
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:54,437
Speaker 1: Well, you know, actually, that is the thing, is that component cables, even the cheapest ones from Radio Shack, are still kinda expensive.

424
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:55,480
Speaker 1: They're like $10, $15.

425
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,324
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but you know what?

426
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:59,637
Speaker 0: The cheapest one is no different than the $50 Monster ones.

427
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,821
Speaker 1: Exactly.

428
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:10,680
Speaker 1: If you go to the store, and you see two cables, you go to Radio Shack, and they have plain, normal video cable for connecting your DVD player to your television.

429
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Speaker 1: And then you go to Circuit City, and they have the Monster cable, which is the exact same cable, but it's all fancy and has all kinds of shielding and plastic and colors, and it's ten times as much money.

430
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,162
Speaker 1: Guess what?

431
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:27,580
Speaker 1: Both of those cables are exactly identical in function.

432
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:32,507
Speaker 0: Yes, and even worse are when people try to pass off digital cables as different.

433
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:35,252
Speaker 0: A digital cable is a digital cable.

434
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:39,298
Speaker 0: The signal either gets all the way there, or it never gets there.

435
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:40,760
Speaker 0: There is no middle ground.

436
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:48,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, on an analog cable, just so we can get this straight, you're sending an electrical wave over the wire.

437
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:51,020
Speaker 0: So if the cable's poorly shielded or something, you could get interference.

438
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,893
Speaker 1: Yes, it is possible for there to be interference on that wire.

439
00:30:54,953 --> 00:31:00,159
Speaker 1: You'll know if, like, your speakers are going like... Then there's probably interference going on.

440
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,619
Speaker 0: However, the lie here is that the so-called better cables aren't actually any better, but anyway...

441
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:12,651
Speaker 1: Yes, but digital cables, all they're doing is going zero, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, one, and you know what?

442
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:16,277
Speaker 1: Either the zeros and ones make it to the other end, or they don't.

443
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:18,360
Speaker 1: You can't interfere with the zeros and ones.

444
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:23,720
Speaker 0: Because if you interfere with them, that means that there's such a powerful interference that no cable would have worked.

445
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,904
Speaker 1: And that it'll just not work.

446
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:28,511
Speaker 1: You won't hear, like, your music won't get messed up.

447
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:31,740
Speaker 1: You just won't hear music, because the zeros and ones won't make it.

448
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,858
Speaker 1: I mean, if I sent you an MP3 that's missing a few ones and zeros, you can't play it in your MP3 player.

449
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:38,460
Speaker 1: It won't work.

450
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,600
Speaker 1: That's what happens if zeros and ones go missing, which means someone probably cut your cable with a scissor or a knife or something.

451
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 0: So, despite this, whenever you go to a place like Circuit City or Best Buy, the salesmen are told, they're trained, they must try to sell you the Monster cables.

452
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,047
Speaker 0: Now, when we say Monster, I mean the brand Monster.

453
00:31:57,067 --> 00:32:01,720
Speaker 0: They're a brand, and they charge five or six times what they should for something that is not any better.

454
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,200
Speaker 1: There are other brands that try to pull a similar scam, but they're all the same, and Monster is the worst offender.

455
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:12,200
Speaker 0: Yes, and power supplies, well not really power supplies, but power strips and UPSs.

456
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:29,540
Speaker 1: Yes, if you go to Best Buy, and they have this $200 power strip, and they claim it does all these filtering things, and they even have a spot where, like, you can filter your telephone cable, and you can filter your network cable, and you can filter your audio cables, your coaxial cable television cable.

457
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,204
Speaker 1: And, guess what?

458
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:33,071
Speaker 1: None of those things do shit.

459
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,420
Speaker 1: They don't do anything.

460
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,334
Speaker 0: Now, there are some situations where you would need some sort of power conditioning, because power that comes into your house is not perfect.

461
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,020
Speaker 0: It is not the exact number of hertz that they say it is.

462
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,838
Speaker 0: It is not the exact frequencies they say it is, because our electrical system is really old, and it really doesn't matter.

463
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:52,440
Speaker 0: No one cares.

464
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:04,860
Speaker 0: And, minor fluctuation like this could affect the long-term usefulness or viability of electronic equipment, and in extreme cases could somehow affect the audio in certain devices.

465
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Speaker 0: However, if that is the case, an actual power conditioner would cost a quarter of what these crap fake power strips sell for, and for $30, you could buy a UPS that would rectify the power 100%.

466
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,022
Speaker 1: Yep, let me give you an example.

467
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:35,260
Speaker 1: If you plug your computer's power supply directly into the wall, you know, the fact that the power isn't perfect will probably, over time, over a long period of time, eventually cause your power supply in your computer to stop functioning.

468
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,551
Speaker 0: Because when there are sudden voltage drops, the power supply has to make up for it.

469
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:41,040
Speaker 0: When there's little surges, the power supply has to deal with it.

470
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,540
Speaker 0: Yes,

471
00:33:42,041 --> 00:34:01,540
Speaker 1: but if you had a UPS, which is basically a battery, in between your computer and the wall, that battery will handle it whenever the wall isn't perfect, and as far as your power supply in your computer is concerned, everything is perfect, because the battery is, you know, a nice little buffer, and everything's taken care of.

472
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:03,444
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean, think of it this way.

473
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:08,755
Speaker 0: You can buy one of these magic power strips for like $50, $60, $70, up to $200 or $300.

474
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,496
Speaker 0: that doesn't do much.

475
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,219
Speaker 0: It's just a fancy power surge protector.

476
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,567
Speaker 1: I mean, it is a surge protector.

477
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,639
Speaker 1: It surge protects, you know, with the rest of them.

478
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:21,239
Speaker 0: Or, for $30, you can buy a UPS for one computer, or one device.

479
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:21,860
Speaker 1: Yep.

480
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Speaker 0: That'll be just as good, in fact, better, because it'll also protect you if the power goes out.

481
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:36,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, my computer with this $30 UPS will stay on for like a few minutes if the power goes out, which gives me enough time to press shutdown, and then it'll turn off.

482
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,126
Speaker 0: Now, you think we're just talking about audio and video.

483
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:43,600
Speaker 0: Say you go to Best Buy, they're the worst for this, and you buy a USB printer.

484
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:55,520
Speaker 0: Now, the USB printer is always very, very cheap, and they follow the razor blade model and get you with the ink cartridge later, but aside from that, USB printers don't come with USB cables anymore.

485
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:02,940
Speaker 0: And if you look, the only USB cables that Best Buy sells are either Monster brand or the equivalent.

486
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,717
Speaker 1: Does Monster really make USB cables?

487
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,550
Speaker 0: Yes, yes.

488
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, USB cables can be--basically, USB is four wires.

489
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,780
Speaker 1: Plus, minus, electricity, and ground.

490
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,518
Speaker 0: That's it.

491
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,161
Speaker 2: That's it.

492
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,120
Speaker 1: It's four wires all bundled up with a plug on each end.

493
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,448
Speaker 0: So if you need USB cables, look around online.

494
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:23,900
Speaker 0: You can buy pretty much any lengths you want for four or five dollars a cable.

495
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,654
Speaker 1: Yes, buy in bulk, because if you're a person with computers in your house, you need USB cables.

496
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,520
Speaker 1: We actually have a shortage of USB cables.

497
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:30,941
Speaker 0: You know what?

498
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,024
Speaker 0: Not even in bulk.

499
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:38,560
Speaker 0: Even if you buy them online or just from local computer shops, they're cheap as hell, because you can just make them if you really want.

500
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,566
Speaker 1: I know, but we can just go online right now and buy--you can buy different colors, too.

501
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:54,700
Speaker 1: You get four or five USB cables, the A-to-B kind or the B-to-B kind, and you'll be set forever, and it'll run you less than the cost of one or two cables at Best Buy or Circuit City.

502
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,248
Speaker 0: Now, Best Buy will try to get--they'll say, "Oh, you need a USB cable for this,".

503
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:02,900
Speaker 0: and then they'll hand you the Monster cable, and they'll actually try to talk you out of not buying it.

504
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,451
Speaker 0: They might even say things like, "It works better," or, "It's

505
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:05,894
Speaker 0: faster.".

506
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,080
Speaker 0: They'll just lie to you outright.

507
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:17,100
Speaker 1: The reason for this is that they make an incredible amount of money on those cables, because they pay Monster maybe, what, like 10, 15 bucks for those things?

508
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,200
Speaker 0: The markup is insane.

509
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,144
Speaker 1: And then they sell them for 50 or something.

510
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:20,865
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

511
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:28,100
Speaker 1: They make a lot more money by selling you a crazy, stupid power strip and a bunch of cables than they make by selling you a television.

512
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,285
Speaker 0: You think it ends there?

513
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,400
Speaker 0: Ethernet cables are the same way.

514
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,100
Speaker 1: Oh, God, Ethernet cables are the worst.

515
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:41,920
Speaker 0: All right, now think about the last time you were in a computer store, and you saw, you know, like the 10-foot and the 5-foot and the 20-foot Ethernet cables, network cables, and how much they cost.

516
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:52,120
Speaker 0: I will tell you right now that I can right now, in my house, make for you an Ethernet cable, and it would cost me about seven cents per foot.

517
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,879
Speaker 1: Seven cents, people.

518
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,239
Speaker 1: Seven cents.

519
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,437
Speaker 1: Yet they're selling 5-foot cables at Staples for like 15 bucks.

520
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,663
Speaker 0: Now, why are those cables better?

521
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:02,644
Speaker 0: The answer is no.

522
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:14,220
Speaker 0: In fact, in many cases, they're not as good, because they're usually Cat 5e, and actually most people who actually wire buildings use Cat 6e, because it costs the same, and it theoretically in most situations can do gigabit Ethernet.

523
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,200
Speaker 1: Theoretically.

524
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:15,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

525
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:16,618
Speaker 0: We've done it.

526
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

527
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:24,780
Speaker 1: The point here is that if you go to Home Depot, you can buy a box of Ethernet cable for like 40 bucks, and it's like a bajillion feet.

528
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,820
Speaker 0: Or you can just buy it by the foot, and even then, it's like 10 or 11 cents a foot.

529
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:29,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

530
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:49,580
Speaker 1: I remember at work, we needed a whole bunch of cables, and we called up some place, and, you know, we ordered like, I think it was like 100 8-foot Ethernet cables, and, you know, sure, it was a little bit more expensive than if we had gone to Home Depot to buy a box of cable or made it ourselves, but it was way cheaper than buying them from Staples or Best Buy.

531
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,085
Speaker 1: Way cheaper.

532
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:53,460
Speaker 1: Like, hundreds and hundreds of dollars cheaper.

533
00:37:54,241 --> 00:38:02,980
Speaker 0: Now, the general moral of this, because if you don't know about the technology of whatever it is you're purchasing, it might not be easy to spot when something is a ripoff and when something isn't.

534
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:17,660
Speaker 0: Like, when you're doing audio stuff, for example, yeah, the magic special monster cable isn't any better than the shit cable, but if you're doing something professional, you want to look at the impedance, and you want to match everything, and you've got to get certain kinds of cables sometimes.

535
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,160
Speaker 0: But it depends on what you're doing, and if you don't know about the technology, there's no way you're going to find out.

536
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:33,839
Speaker 1: So basically, unless you're a professional working in, like, a record studio recording artists and music and all that sort of shit, or at a real radio station, buy the cheapest you can get.

537
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:34,620
Speaker 1: that does the job.

538
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:46,660
Speaker 0: More importantly, if you're ever in a big box store or a chain, basically, my advice to you is, one, never listen to anything a salesperson tells you that isn't a price.

539
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:53,140
Speaker 0: Because they will outright lie in many situations to trick you into buying the things that make them the most money.

540
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:03,960
Speaker 1: Yup, I mean, there's a famous story, it's semi-famous, of this guy who went to Best Buy, and he knew this, he knew all these things that we know, and he basically wanted to buy an HDTV.

541
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:14,899
Speaker 1: And, you know, he knew which TV he wanted, and he bargained with the Best Buy guy, and he said, "Alright, you lower the price on this TV, and I'll buy this crazy $200 power strip and all these monster

542
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:15,300
Speaker 1: cables.".

543
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,343
Speaker 1: So the Best Buy guy was like, "Yes!

544
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:18,064
Speaker 1: Haha!

545
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:19,066
Speaker 1: Alright!".

546
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:21,851
Speaker 1: I lowered the price on the guy's TV, and he bought all these cables.

547
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,396
Speaker 1: That's great for me, as an employee of the store.

548
00:39:24,756 --> 00:39:26,880
Speaker 1: I get a lot of, you know, brownie points for that.

549
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,680
Speaker 0: Yup, or sometimes commissions or kickbacks, depends on the store.

550
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,467
Speaker 1: Yup, so the guy buys the TV and all these cables, and he goes home.

551
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:39,880
Speaker 1: The next day, he comes back and returns all the cables and the power strip unopened, and he basically gets a discounted TV.

552
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,569
Speaker 1: Of course, he had to fight for it, but I think he won in the end.

553
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:44,697
Speaker 1: The point is, is that, yeah.

554
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:45,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

555
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, they will outright lie to you, and usually, they don't even know they're lying, because they don't know anything about this stuff.

556
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,720
Speaker 1: Oh god, those people who work in Best Buy, Circuit City, even Radio Shack nowadays, they don't know shit.

557
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,645
Speaker 0: The thing is, they are given, like say, they sell monster cables at Best Buy.

558
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:09,720
Speaker 0: They are given little classes or talks on monster cables and how great they are, and these are run by Monster, or the company that makes money.

559
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,643
Speaker 1: Yes, these people are trained salesmen.

560
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:24,780
Speaker 1: They don't really know anything about televisions or electronics, or maybe there's like the rare high school or college kid who's working there part-time who actually knows something, and you know, just wants to get a discount in the video games and the anime.

561
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,539
Speaker 0: But even then, he'll get in trouble if he actually tells you what's up.

562
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,062
Speaker 1: He will indeed.

563
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,407
Speaker 1: If he is caught telling you the real deal, he will get in trouble.

564
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:37,960
Speaker 1: And also, he has an incentive to lie to you and go with the flow, because then he makes more commissions and money and all that good stuff.

565
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:41,420
Speaker 1: You know, so usually those guys tend to work in the video game section.

566
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:43,322
Speaker 0: Yeah.

567
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:53,980
Speaker 0: I guess the rules are, one, never trust anything a salesperson tells you, especially when it comes to technology, and two, never buy cables from Circuit City or Best Buy.

568
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,280
Speaker 1: Or other similar stores you might have.

569
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,000
Speaker 0: Buy them from a local computer store, they'll be far cheaper, or buy them online.

570
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,298
Speaker 1: Radio Shack, if you get the normal cables, they're slightly overpriced, but it's better than anywhere else.

571
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:05,720
Speaker 1: you're gonna go.

572
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,293
Speaker 0: If you live anywhere near a geek, or you live near the Geek House here, give us a call.

573
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,600
Speaker 0: I'll make you any frickin' ethernet cable you want.

574
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

575
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:18,580
Speaker 1: Alright, now there's one more lie that we want to talk about, and that is the lie of specifications.

576
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,914
Speaker 0: Now you might see, you know, someone sells a new HDTV, and they say, "Oh, it has a 8,000 to 1 contrast

577
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:25,274
Speaker 0: ratio.".

578
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:37,818
Speaker 1: Or you'll go and you'll buy a new LCD monitor, and they'll say, you know, "Contrast ratio this, color saturation somethin'

579
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:38,119
Speaker 1: else.".

580
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:42,417
Speaker 1: Or you'll buy a sound card, and they'll say, "Siggle the noise ratio

581
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:42,859
Speaker 1: somethin'.".

582
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:52,220
Speaker 0: The biggest problem was monitors, and at the peak of the CRT days, before LCDs were viable in any stretch, the-- Like, I think 1996, 1997.

583
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, that era, when they would say the dot pitch.

584
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:55,658
Speaker 0: Oh god.

585
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,424
Speaker 0: And they would give you the dot pitch of the monitor.

586
00:41:57,464 --> 00:42:02,477
Speaker 0: Now, some statistics about technology are accurate representations.

587
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:03,580
Speaker 0: They're objective measures.

588
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,034
Speaker 1: For example, I would say, "This monitor supports a maximum resolution of

589
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:08,075
Speaker 1: 1280x1024.".

590
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,452
Speaker 0: That is objective.

591
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:12,359
Speaker 0: It cannot show-- At X number of hertz.

592
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,360
Speaker 0: It cannot show more than that many pixels at that many hertz.

593
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,019
Speaker 1: At that speed.

594
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:20,137
Speaker 0: Or, "This monitor requires this much power to

595
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:20,639
Speaker 0: operate.".

596
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:24,439
Speaker 1: Or, "This monitor has a DVI cable hole and a VGA

597
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:24,660
Speaker 1: hole.".

598
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:27,751
Speaker 0: Now, beyond that, contrast ratio.

599
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,200
Speaker 0: We'll use that first, 'cause that's the easiest one to just throw away.

600
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:30,695
Speaker 1: It is.

601
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:39,780
Speaker 0: Now, theoretically, it is the ratio of the difference between the brightest color a monitor can show and the blackest color a monitor can show.

602
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,580
Speaker 1: So, what you want in a contrast ratio of any display technology is a very high number and a very low number.

603
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,780
Speaker 1: 'Cause that means that when there is black on the screen, it will be pitch black.

604
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:53,740
Speaker 1: And when there is white on the screen, it will be white, white, white.

605
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:59,520
Speaker 0: Now, a lot of companies, especially lower-end or shadier ones, will advertise all sorts of different contrast ratios.

606
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:11,800
Speaker 0: The thing is, you have to bear in mind that with most of these non-purely objective statistics, there is absolutely no standard or regulatory control over how they advertise this.

607
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,920
Speaker 0: And every company can measure it in any cockamamie way they want.

608
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, so one company says, "Oh, this is how we measure contrast ratio.

609
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:20,377
Speaker 1: We use this

610
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:20,759
Speaker 1: method.".

611
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,575
Speaker 1: "And then we round off to the nearest thousandth, and then

612
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:23,816
Speaker 1: this.".

613
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,058
Speaker 1: And, you know, they give you a number like, "Oh, this thing has an 8,000 to 1 contrast

614
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:28,420
Speaker 1: ratio.".

615
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,935
Speaker 1: And another company measures some other monitor, and they say, "This one has a 6,000 to

616
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:33,120
Speaker 1: 1.".

617
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,560
Speaker 1: But the 6,000 to 1 actually looks better and has a darker black and a brighter white than the 8,000 to 1.

618
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,620
Speaker 0: Yep.

619
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,588
Speaker 0: And sometimes, they'll straight-up lie.

620
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,596
Speaker 0: They really will, especially some shady companies.

621
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:43,640
Speaker 0: They'll just make up numbers.

622
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,435
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll be like, "Oh yeah, this thing has a 10 hajillion to 1 contrast ratio.

623
00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:48,198
Speaker 1: It's the best thing in the

624
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:48,579
Speaker 1: universe.".

625
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:50,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's better.

626
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,860
Speaker 1: Also, when TVs are on the display floor, they often set the color settings to look really good on a display floor.

627
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:07,320
Speaker 1: But those aren't the settings you use at home, so don't trust the way the screen looks in the store as to how it's going to look in your house.

628
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:07,921
Speaker 0: Yep.

629
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:13,360
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember I read an article of exactly what they do to TVs in Best Buy, because someone leaked the document.

630
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:13,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:25,620
Speaker 1: What you want to do is you want to go into the Best Buy, you want to pick up the remote, and reset the TV to the settings that you're going to use at home in a normal, you know, "watching a real movie" condition.

632
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:35,600
Speaker 0: Also, if you can, you want to put in any DVD or input other than what they're showing, because they show things that very specifically are designed to make the TVs look a lot sharper than they are.

633
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:45,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, they show cartoons with really bright colors, they show nature things, they show concerts with bright lights and fog, you know, they show super epic Hollywood movies.

634
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,035
Speaker 1: Go grab yourself like a normal DVD from the shelf, you know, of like an 80s movie or something, or an anime, and put that in there.

635
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:55,320
Speaker 1: And then you'll be able to tell what's going on.

636
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:57,786
Speaker 0: Now, dot pitch was another big one.

637
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:02,580
Speaker 0: It's not so much of an issue now, because with LCD monitors it's really an irrelevant statistic.

638
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,160
Speaker 0: Yep.

639
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,035
Speaker 0: But it's the, especially on CRTs and televisions, it is basically the distance between the pixels, or between the colors.

640
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:13,740
Speaker 0: Now I say "or" because that's tricky.

641
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,371
Speaker 0: I mean, on CRTs you usually have three different phosphors for every pixel.

642
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:21,780
Speaker 0: So did they measure from the center of those three to the center of the other three?

643
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:23,123
Speaker 0: What if they're in a line?

644
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:28,013
Speaker 0: Do they measure it diagonally, up and down, horizontally, vertically, backwards?

645
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:31,640
Speaker 0: There are so many ways to do it that the statistic becomes meaningless.

646
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,400
Speaker 1: There are lots of other different measurements for different products, not just display technologies.

647
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,800
Speaker 0: Like even processors, the megahertz.

648
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:47,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, megahertz is a pretty solid measurement in and of itself, but the megahertz is not directly proportional to the speed of the computer.

649
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:54,940
Speaker 1: I can get, if you want, I can go find a one gigahertz processor that's faster than a one and a half gigahertz processor.

650
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,308
Speaker 0: See, because first we talked about statistics and data that are either useless or outright lies.

651
00:46:00,669 --> 00:46:07,960
Speaker 0: There's also the case where there is data that is perfectly verifiable and legitimate, but people will grossly overstate or understate the significance.

652
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:17,800
Speaker 0: Like say there's mega blobs and a fleam has eight mega blobs, but this other company's fleam has nine mega blobs.

653
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,128
Speaker 0: Now, what's the difference of one mega blob?

654
00:46:21,388 --> 00:46:23,635
Speaker 0: I mean, is one mega blob something that you'll notice?

655
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:25,300
Speaker 0: Is it something inconsequential?

656
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:28,600
Speaker 1: Is it worth the difference in price between the two products?

657
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,783
Speaker 0: Is it even measurable?

658
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,448
Speaker 0: It could just be a statistical coincidence.

659
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:35,660
Speaker 0: I mean, a really important thing here is the idea of statistical significance.

660
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:49,760
Speaker 0: Not going to go over it because none of you care, but you can analyze data and based on the data and the data set and various calculus, you can figure out how reliable or accurate or useful the data you have is.

661
00:46:50,460 --> 00:47:00,299
Speaker 0: So you'll be able to say like within a precision of 5% in either direction, we are 95% sure that this number is within 5% of this number or something like that.

662
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:13,680
Speaker 0: Below that, a number is not statistically significant, meaning you can't reasonably draw a conclusion based on the number because the difference in the number is so negligible that it's not differentiable from static.

663
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this monitor has a 5 and the other monitor has a 4.9.

664
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,994
Speaker 1: Well, is the 5 better than the 4.9?

665
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:24,199
Speaker 1: We don't know because we might have measured the 4.9 wrong.

666
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,006
Speaker 1: It might actually be a 5.3.

667
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:31,500
Speaker 1: It could just be noise rate randomness in the measuring process.

668
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,002
Speaker 0: I mean, think in first person shooters.

669
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:38,951
Speaker 0: I mean, the difference between 10 frames per second and 20 frames per second is insane.

670
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:45,320
Speaker 0: The difference between 100 frames a second and 500 is undetectable by human eyes.

671
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,821
Speaker 1: Exactly.

672
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:53,596
Speaker 1: Even though if someone came up and told you this thing is 500 frames a second and that one's only 100, you'd be like, "Holy crap, it's five times

673
00:47:53,657 --> 00:47:53,877
Speaker 1: better.".

674
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,140
Speaker 1: No, it's zero times better.

675
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,083
Speaker 0: Now, with technology, the advice isn't so easy.

676
00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:06,437
Speaker 0: Well, with technology like that, it's not as easy as, "Don't listen to the salespeople, don't buy any cables in the store," because there's really no one.

677
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:07,338
Speaker 0: You just have to ask a geek.

678
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:08,560
Speaker 0: I hate to say that, but...

679
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:16,474
Speaker 1: Well, what you can also do is before you buy any consumer electronic product, you want to research not any specific product.

680
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:19,860
Speaker 1: You want to research that variety of product itself.

681
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,727
Speaker 1: So if you're in the market for an HDTV, research HDTVs.

682
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:28,012
Speaker 1: Learn everything you can about HDTV technology.

683
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:33,760
Speaker 1: And don't get your information from any company that sells HDTVs, like Best Buy or Circuit City.

684
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:40,108
Speaker 1: Don't get your information from any company that makes HDTVs, like, I don't know, Samsung or Sony or anyone.

685
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:49,118
Speaker 1: Get your information from independent, geek sources that talk about the technology itself, like in Gadget or us or someone, anywhere.

686
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:50,440
Speaker 0: Wikipedia even.

687
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,222
Speaker 0: Keep in mind that we do this, too.

688
00:48:52,343 --> 00:49:02,597
Speaker 0: When I bought my first, when I built my first computer, before I went to RIT, I spent over two months researching every single component and learning everything I could about them.

689
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:04,800
Speaker 0: I learned about all the different kinds of RAM and chipsets.

690
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,580
Speaker 1: I had a one-year subscription to Computer Shopper just to learn all that stuff.

691
00:49:09,021 --> 00:49:18,533
Speaker 0: I mean, I would read about how sound cards worked in detail, so then when I went to the store and I looked at two sound cards, I could say to myself, "Wow, this one is clearly superior.

692
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:19,314
Speaker 0: I will purchase

693
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:19,414
Speaker 0: it.".

694
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:22,719
Speaker 0: Or, "This one is only slightly superior but costs ten times as much.

695
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:22,999
Speaker 0: This is

696
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:23,420
Speaker 0: bullshit.".

697
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:32,876
Speaker 1: Yes, if you are less knowledgeable than the Best Buy and Circuit City employees, they are going to fool you and you're going to end up getting ripped off and buying some monster cables.

698
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:35,020
Speaker 1: You have to know more than they do.

699
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,241
Speaker 1: I mean, it's sad.

700
00:49:36,382 --> 00:49:51,380
Speaker 1: I wish, I really wish that I didn't have to know more than them because I wish that the Best Buy and Circuit City employees were experts who knew everything about technology and were honest and would share the truth and really help you find the best product at the best price.

701
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,388
Speaker 0: The problem is that's not economically viable.

702
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:56,380
Speaker 0: You make much more money by selling schlock to idiots.

703
00:49:56,782 --> 00:49:58,820
Speaker 1: And having idiots sell schlock to idiots.

704
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,320
Speaker 0: Yes.

705
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:04,428
Speaker 1: If there was a store where there were, like, genius geeks running the store, that would be the best store in the world.

706
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,810
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have to research shit.

707
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:06,651
Speaker 1: It would be so great.

708
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:11,438
Speaker 1: I would go into the store and I would say, "Genius geeks who spend your life in this store.

709
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:11,979
Speaker 1: You know what to

710
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:12,300
Speaker 1: buy.".

711
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,466
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember the exact moment when I became disillusioned.

712
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:20,151
Speaker 0: I went to a computer store that no longer exists.

713
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:22,454
Speaker 0: And this was before I'd even built a computer.

714
00:50:22,474 --> 00:50:24,697
Speaker 0: I mean, this is way back in the day.

715
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,400
Speaker 0: Windows NT had just come out.

716
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,765
Speaker 0: And I go to this big computer store.

717
00:50:29,045 --> 00:50:31,892
Speaker 0: It was like a computer store and nothing more.

718
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:35,059
Speaker 0: They only sold computers and computer equipment.

719
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:35,620
Speaker 0: It was huge.

720
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,403
Speaker 0: And I found a salesman and I talked to him.

721
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:43,473
Speaker 0: And I said, "I want a dual CPU machine with Windows

722
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:44,275
Speaker 0: NT.".

723
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:46,780
Speaker 0: Because I'd read about Windows NT and I wanted to try it.

724
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,905
Speaker 0: And I had all these demands and things I wanted.

725
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,631
Speaker 0: And the guy stared at me like I was an idiot.

726
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,360
Speaker 0: And I don't think he even knew what I meant by dual CPU.

727
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,463
Speaker 0: And then he said, "You don't want Windows

728
00:50:58,564 --> 00:50:58,884
Speaker 0: NT.".

729
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:00,867
Speaker 0: And I said, "Why

730
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:01,147
Speaker 0: not?".

731
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:03,010
Speaker 0: And he said, "No one uses Windows NT.

732
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:04,632
Speaker 0: It's too hard to use.

733
00:51:04,692 --> 00:51:04,792
Speaker 0: It's

734
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,353
Speaker 0: expensive.".

735
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:07,977
Speaker 0: I said, "But I want Windows NT.

736
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,040
Speaker 0: I know all about it and I want to run

737
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,100
Speaker 0: it.".

738
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,605
Speaker 0: And he said, "You don't want Windows

739
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:11,987
Speaker 0: NT.".

740
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:15,580
Speaker 0: And that was really pretty much the end of that day of shopping.

741
00:51:16,664 --> 00:51:17,439
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.

742
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:21,100
Speaker 0: I mean, I wish I was exaggerating or making that up, but that's what happened.

743
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:23,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

744
00:51:23,783 --> 00:51:26,250
Speaker 1: I mean, the more expensive product is clearly superior.

745
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,792
Speaker 1: Alright.

746
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we're done, but people did complain that the show cuts off abruptly, so now I'm going to ramble for a little bit.

747
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,360
Speaker 1: Well, I think I just want to talk a little bit more about some of the audiophile stuff.

748
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:40,459
Speaker 0: Alright, we've gone on a bit long, though, so.

749
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:49,360
Speaker 1: Alright, because at the beginning we kind of brushed it off, but there is a lot of stuff out there in audiophile technology which is just completely false.

750
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:54,689
Speaker 1: Like, we're not even talking about, you know, they lie about the numbers or they overcharge.

751
00:51:54,729 --> 00:52:01,580
Speaker 1: We're talking about this is a speaker that, you know, they'll say this wooden volume knob will make your stereo sound better.

752
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,162
Speaker 1: We're not kidding.

753
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:04,673
Speaker 0: That was a very specific product.

754
00:52:04,894 --> 00:52:06,200
Speaker 0: In fact, it had imitators.

755
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:13,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, or they'll say these crystals, if you put these crystals or you put this sticker on the side of your speakers, it'll make it sound more natural.

756
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,833
Speaker 0: I read someone's blog, and it was an audiophile, and he'd talk about it with an audiophile friend.

757
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:21,079
Speaker 0: It was linked to, in fact, from the JREF a while ago.

758
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:27,200
Speaker 0: And this guy was testing sound with someone in a room with an oak table in the room and a turntable.

759
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:37,460
Speaker 0: And, you know, they were comparing the various between this diamond-tipped needle and this other slightly different diamond-tipped needle and this power cable versus this power cable and all sorts of masturbatory bullshit.

760
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,603
Speaker 0: And the worst part is that these people will lie to each other and themselves.

761
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:50,711
Speaker 0: They will convince themselves that they hear the difference, thus justifying their purchase, and thus they can say to other people, "Oh, of course you couldn't hear it.

762
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:52,333
Speaker 0: I have the golden ear.

763
00:52:52,653 --> 00:53:00,280
Speaker 0: My ears are so attuned to the wonderful nature of music that I can hear the slightest disturbance in the sound and blah blah blah blah blah blah

764
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,580
Speaker 0: blah.".

765
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:03,324
Speaker 1: Yes, there are people selling products.

766
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:13,140
Speaker 1: If anyone tries to sell you anything, and they say that it will make your music sound better, unless it's like a dollar, they're probably lying to you.

767
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,627
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean-- They're probably just selling something that does nothing.

768
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:20,799
Speaker 1: A wooden volume knob does nothing except make your volume knob look like wood.

769
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:23,464
Speaker 0: I mean, there are high-end audio things.

770
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:29,694
Speaker 0: I mean, I could buy a $400 pair of monitor headphones that is absolutely perfect in every way.

771
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,757
Speaker 0: These people will buy $4,000 ones.

772
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,620
Speaker 1: That are perfect in every way, but no different.

773
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:45,280
Speaker 0: In fact, many times, this audiophile stuff is actually worse because the people buying it can't actually tell, and you make so much more money by making it cheaply and quickly.

774
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:50,505
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, some guy will say, "Oh, I made this cable out of gold.

775
00:53:50,805 --> 00:54:04,919
Speaker 1: It makes everything sound so much better, and it has a platinum core, and it's only $7,000 for this incredibly amazing cable that will allow no interference and transmit perfect analog audio from your analog amplifier to your

776
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:05,840
Speaker 1: speakers.".

777
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:10,176
Speaker 1: And some crazy audiophile will go, "Oh my god, I bought it, and I can totally hear the difference.

778
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:10,879
Speaker 1: This is the greatest thing

779
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:11,080
Speaker 1: ever.".

780
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm so much better than everyone else who can't hear it.

781
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,424
Speaker 1: When in fact, it might not even be a gold cable.

782
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:25,420
Speaker 1: It's probably just like a cable spray-painted with gold, and, you know, with some lead in it to make it heavy, and it doesn't make the sound any better than the cheap-ass cables from RadioShack.

783
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:36,880
Speaker 0: That's actually one trick that a lot of low-end but marketed to the high-end audience will use, is they will put weights inside of their equipment to make it feel heavier and feel more massive and meaningful.

784
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:51,460
Speaker 1: Yes, if you want to buy a stereo, right, and you're not sure if it's going to sound good or not, or if you're spending too much to make it sound good, all you have to do is pay attention to one, the speakers, and two, the amplifier.

785
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:59,353
Speaker 0: The best thing to do is just run some sort of blind test where you get someone else to play the two stereos while you stand with your back turned, and see if you can hear the difference.

786
00:54:59,393 --> 00:54:59,854
Speaker 0: And you know what?

787
00:55:00,355 --> 00:55:03,060
Speaker 0: If you can't easily tell the difference, there's effectively no difference.

788
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,540
Speaker 1: And you just buy whichever one's cheaper.

789
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:16,340
Speaker 0: Now, to go back to that blog, they had this big oak table in the room, and they're listening to all this stuff, and then they decided to take a lunch break, and they come back, and one of them was drinking tea, and he had spilled some tea on the oak table.

790
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:31,680
Speaker 0: Now, they started listening to everything again to confirm their findings, and suddenly the sound was all wrong, and everything was terrible, and they couldn't figure out why everything sounded bad, and then he realized he had spilled tea on the oak table.

791
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:33,424
Speaker 0: I am not kidding.

792
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,690
Speaker 0: That is what they decided was ruining the sound quality.

793
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:41,260
Speaker 0: So they had the oak table removed from the room, and suddenly everything went back to normal.

794
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,521
Speaker 1: Yeah.

795
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,420
Speaker 1: So, that's called crazy people.

796
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:53,679
Speaker 0: Now, the best part is, all of these people, if you subject them to a double blind test, wherein they don't know what stereo system they're listening to...

797
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:56,464
Speaker 1: So, let me explain this in more detail.

798
00:55:56,484 --> 00:55:57,625
Speaker 1: You blindfold someone.

799
00:55:58,006 --> 00:55:59,268
Speaker 1: You put them in a room.

800
00:55:59,628 --> 00:56:02,132
Speaker 1: You then turn a stereo on playing song.

801
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:05,437
Speaker 1: You then change to the other stereo playing the same song.

802
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:07,880
Speaker 1: You then ask them which one sounded better.

803
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:17,040
Speaker 0: And you do this a bunch of times, and every study has shown that not only can they not tell the difference, but oftentimes, if anything, they'll prefer the much cheaper system.

804
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

805
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:27,391
Speaker 1: I mean, there have been tests where people have compared $10,000 Bose home theaters to the $100 cheap Asian brand.

806
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:35,020
Speaker 1: home theater in a box, and the home theater in a box wins, even when you plug an iPod into it, as opposed to a DVD player or something.

807
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:36,564
Speaker 0: Now, a nice trick here.

808
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:41,437
Speaker 0: You might have heard the phrase, "No highs, no lows, must be

809
00:56:41,517 --> 00:56:42,139
Speaker 0: Bose.".

810
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:48,659
Speaker 0: Now, while that's a little bit true in that Bose speakers tend to be very overpriced, especially for what you get...

811
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,464
Speaker 1: I mean, they do sound good.

812
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:56,860
Speaker 1: They're not bad speakers, you know, if you're comparing them solely as speakers and not as the price and everything else.

813
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:08,077
Speaker 0: But, basically, anyone who's trying to give you advice about audio, and they say that phrase in a non-ironic, non-jocular way, do not take their advice, because that is like the creed.

814
00:57:08,297 --> 00:57:10,380
Speaker 0: That's the mating signal of an audiophile.

815
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,317
Speaker 1: Exactly.

816
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,278
Speaker 0: Good God.

817
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:21,358
Speaker 1: Bose has somehow marketed itself and actually convinced people that their product is somehow sounds better than other people's stuff.

818
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:21,738
Speaker 1: Guess what?

819
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:22,560
Speaker 1: It's just speakers.

820
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:31,380
Speaker 1: I mean, they charge for Bose speakers like 10 times as much as they charge for other speakers, and they sound good, but they're not that much better.

821
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,731
Speaker 1: There's nothing special about Bose that's any better than Sony or Samsung or Pioneer or anyone else.

822
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:38,973
Speaker 1: They're just speakers.

823
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:43,240
Speaker 1: They're just good speakers, but they're not super amazing worth of fortune.

824
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,380
Speaker 0: And on that note, Scott, I'm cutting you off, because now we have gone long.

825
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:46,797
Speaker 0: Okay.

826
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,362
Speaker 0: And I think the episode was long enough.

827
00:57:48,743 --> 00:57:53,570
Speaker 0: Once again, give us feedback as to how you want the show to change, if you want to change it at all.

828
00:57:54,071 --> 00:58:00,440
Speaker 0: We're not going to talk about our changes, we're just going to start making them, so let us know if anything works particularly well or you don't like it or whatever.

829
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:01,380
Speaker 1: All right.

830
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,989
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

831
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,580
