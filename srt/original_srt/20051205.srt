1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,872
Speaker 0: It's Monday December 5th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:15,319
Speaker 0: We talk about money, and how not to suck with it.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,240
Speaker 0: Let's do this Yeah, so we had a weekend of super geek up in Albany.

4
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:24,091
Speaker 1: Super geek played all them board games.

5
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:28,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't play a Moisture yeah, and turns out whatever it looks like it could have been the most fun.

6
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,459
Speaker 0: We played a bad board game, and we feel sorry for our friend who bought it.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,882
Speaker 1: Yeah It always.

8
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:39,166
Speaker 1: it always kind of hurts when you buy something and then you're not gonna use it or someone buys you something and you Don't want it.

9
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,618
Speaker 1: It's it's kind of an ad.

10
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:40,820
Speaker 0: yeah.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,085
Speaker 0: Now I got a couple of board games.

12
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:43,607
Speaker 0: I bought that.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,920
Speaker 0: we haven't played in years, so I really can't hate on him too much.

14
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:49,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm all smart piling my spiel disjars.

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,379
Speaker 1: I think I've only got one board game now that no one wants to play hellas hellas.

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,499
Speaker 0: We'll be talking about hellas tomorrow because one I broke that game into the games broken independently of me.

17
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:01,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just busted up.

18
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see why.

19
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:10,555
Speaker 1: now on board game geek There's lots of trading and selling and buying of games You know, but I think I'll stick to you know because I'm into more than just.

20
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:15,000
Speaker 1: I can see if you're into just games That you would buy and trade and sell all different types of games.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,188
Speaker 1: But when you're someone like me who does a bunch of other stuff and board games You just get the best of the best and screw the rest.

22
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

23
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I didn't go to work today.

24
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:32,352
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I noticed cuz I woke up and I was about to go through my normal morning routine And then I heard a grumbly noise and lo and behold your home.

25
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:33,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you know.

26
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:36,088
Speaker 1: some people live Maybe you know half-hour from work.

27
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:39,325
Speaker 1: So if they wake up, you know a little bit late They can still go to work late.

28
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,981
Speaker 0: I show up to work anytime between 7 and like 11.

29
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wake up at 5 30 in the morning.

30
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:53,060
Speaker 1: And if I wake up at 7 or later I might as well not go to work because the train ride I'd get to work.

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Speaker 1: I'd be there for about three hours and they can know the train ride home and it's not worth it at all.

32
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,308
Speaker 1: It's easier to just work from home.

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,614
Speaker 0: I guess it's good though.

34
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,659
Speaker 0: It forces you to wake up.

35
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:07,080
Speaker 0: I mean, I know I can lay in bed another hour and I often do and then I have to stay at work another hour.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:16,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I only messed up a couple times and sometimes there's gotten that 726 train, you know, and I Think you're just a little ill and you seem kind of tired.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,140
Speaker 0: We were trying to watch a ninja movie up in Albany, but you kept falling asleep.

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,803
Speaker 1: Well, cuz it was.

39
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:24,119
Speaker 1: I wouldn't I would have made it if I would have sat up but I laid down and that was it.

40
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,390
Speaker 0: This ninja movie was fantastic.

41
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,335
Speaker 0: We'll have to talk about it.

42
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:31,420
Speaker 1: All right We saw barely any of it so I can't really talk to him.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,368
Speaker 0: I think we'll have to do a whole podcast on bad ninja movies Mm-hmm, because we have several.

44
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,396
Speaker 1: but anyway during my day at home today.

45
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:43,500
Speaker 1: I made an Awesome little demo combining some technologies.

46
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,508
Speaker 0: Okay, I take it you use canvas.

47
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,900
Speaker 1: I use the little Firefox canvas and I combined it.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:03:09,440
Speaker 1: Well, it's not the Firefox canvas is the HTML canvas element and I combined it with the Ajax HTML HTTP request whatever the hell it's called thing so I can Lively update a drawing surface on a web page from a web application without reloading or anything.

49
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,520
Speaker 0: Did you did you draw a penis?

50
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:28,230
Speaker 1: No, but I'm sure The point is is that what I can basically do using this technology is if I spend more than a couple hours on it Is I can make an MMO in 3d in a web browser That requires no downloading.

51
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,500
Speaker 1: No installing and no plugins.

52
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:35,619
Speaker 0: You know, not bad because we've always been bouncing around that idea of an awesome MMO.

53
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:40,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, I'm just gonna not go that far and make like a board game or something.

54
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:52,833
Speaker 1: Yeah for now, but if we ever get any more coders to live near us Yeah, because he before you were just restricted to drawing on the web page whatever you could draw with pings and gifs and CSS and HTML.

55
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:54,999
Speaker 1: now I can draw Anything.

56
00:03:56,525 --> 00:04:00,120
Speaker 1: So it's like oh, yeah My day was great.

57
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:16,920
Speaker 0: I had to set up a secondary DNS server somewhere and I discovered that the routing path between My network and the network where the real DNS server is is blocking DNS traffic specifically and only DNS traffic Thus present preventing me from doing my job.

58
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:25,339
Speaker 1: Wait, but if you block DNS traffic right and the DNS traffic on the blocked side if the DNS server on the block side goes Down won't they lose DNS?

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,114
Speaker 0: They don't get DNS where I am anyway, because it's blocked.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,026
Speaker 1: Oh There is no DNS server in there.

61
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:41,659
Speaker 0: No, it's my own private network that I'm using to build some cool thing I can't really talk about but I have to deal with people who don't particularly care if I complete my job.

62
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,683
Speaker 0: Ah It's awesome.

63
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:45,886
Speaker 1: Totally awesome.

64
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:49,776
Speaker 0: I just found it great that they blocked only that the one thing I needed.

65
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,080
Speaker 0: everything else is fine.

66
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe they knew that was the thing you need and they want to get rid of you.

67
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:58,520
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so it's strike two for Bell South.

68
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,464
Speaker 1: You mean strike three?

69
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,028
Speaker 0: They had a first strike.

70
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,793
Speaker 1: Yeah, they suck.

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,947
Speaker 0: I Mean First they do.

72
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:14,767
Speaker 0: they're crazy, you know Ruined the internet ideas and now They did something really kind of.

73
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,922
Speaker 0: I guess asshole is the only word that can be used to describe this Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:24,619
Speaker 0: So they promised New Orleans they were gonna just as a donation rebuild a police station or some building for him.

75
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,063
Speaker 0: Okay, it was a donation.

76
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,865
Speaker 0: They can pick up the tab.

77
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:27,527
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

78
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:32,420
Speaker 0: independent of that New Orleans is offering all the flood victims free Wi-Fi.

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,893
Speaker 0: They're trying to build a Wi-Fi network to get people back in touch.

80
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,419
Speaker 0: since the phone lines are all still down.

81
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:46,615
Speaker 0: Bell South found out about this decided they didn't like the unfair competition Had an wrote an angry letter to New Orleans and rescinded their donation.

82
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,060
Speaker 1: Well, what were they donating?

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,215
Speaker 0: They I just said they were gonna repair a building.

84
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:57,780
Speaker 1: now See I could understand if you're donating some Wi-Fi and they said screw you we have our own that you would rescind your donation.

85
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:03,984
Speaker 1: maybe donating a building to be nice and then it's like You know.

86
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:07,620
Speaker 1: the image to the public is that we're donating because we're good people.

87
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:13,620
Speaker 1: But really the the truth apparently is we're donating because we're basically buying business.

88
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:18,360
Speaker 1: We're giving you something that we don't need in exchange for business and we don't get the business.

89
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,530
Speaker 1: We're not gonna donate to you.

90
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:26,900
Speaker 0: even better They rescinded the donation about a couple hours after the city announced his Wi-Fi plans.

91
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:31,352
Speaker 0: They called him and angrily told them why like just girl you bastards.

92
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,856
Speaker 0: We're not gonna give you our donation now.

93
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,120
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

94
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,174
Speaker 0: So, uh, I guess Bell South is on the list of things for boycotting.

95
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:41,000
Speaker 1: yeah Bell South this is a bunch of asshats.

96
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bell South is right up there.

97
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:42,827
Speaker 0: But let's see.

98
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:48,276
Speaker 0: We're boycotting American Greetings still the RA RIA Walmart Target.

99
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:57,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for that whole pharmacy thing, yeah, it's nice but it could be a worse pharmacy thing than their policy.

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,188
Speaker 1: Their policy is like the borderline.

101
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:06,579
Speaker 0: Yeah problem is if we boycott all those stores We can't buy things like floor mats or yeah, and all the stores pretty much have the same deal.

102
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:17,136
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Walmart is definitely above and beyond in the worst department though Apparently according to my mom who lives in Arizona someone's running these like super anti Walmart ads on television.

103
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:17,858
Speaker 0: good for them.

104
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,332
Speaker 1: Yeah Now people freaking know but they're gonna still gonna go there because they're freaking dumbasses.

105
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:29,854
Speaker 1: Okay, or because it's a town where there's no more Stores or because they're so poor they can't afford to go anywhere else.

106
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:30,477
Speaker 0: Yeah.

107
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:30,698
Speaker 0: Yeah.

108
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:35,633
Speaker 1: So Adobe, you know bought macromedia a long time ago.

109
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,699
Speaker 1: Yeah today they finished buying them.

110
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:45,123
Speaker 1: So now if you go to macromedia.com, you see the red a up in the top left and it's kind of scary Great.

111
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,666
Speaker 0: So what's flash called now?

112
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:58,700
Speaker 1: It's still called macromedia flash, but we can look forward to in the future is a Single plug-in type thing that encompasses the HTML and the PDFs in the flash and everything.

113
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:09,160
Speaker 1: It's a one one plug-in to rule them all and in the darkness bind them and you can look forward to like You know getting Photoshop and flash in like a bundle and stuff like that.

114
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,519
Speaker 0: I think we can look forward to paying more money, too.

115
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:14,957
Speaker 1: You're definitely gonna be looking forward to paying more money because this company.

116
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:19,939
Speaker 1: basically You know, this is basically three categories of software that I see in all four.

117
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,551
Speaker 1: There's four categories of software in terms of price.

118
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,099
Speaker 1: There's open source free stuff.

119
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,450
Speaker 1: There's the little cheapy bits like, you know, you buy five dollars.

120
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,938
Speaker 1: it you know staples right $50 at staples.

121
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:34,833
Speaker 1: Then is the big packages like Adobe and macromedia and stuff.

122
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,986
Speaker 1: and then there's the enterprise stuff Which doesn't have a price cuz you

123
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:38,287
Speaker 0: yeah,

124
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:44,980
Speaker 1: it's like Oracle you pay a zillion dollars doesn't matter Adobe pretty much that was a monopoly on that third level of software

125
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:52,079
Speaker 0: Yep, and they seem to buy up things that are in the category down and then put them in that high category and run the old company out of business.

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's always easy because one way to put these guys out of business is you know Photoshop.

127
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:58,679
Speaker 1: you have the gimp.

128
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,265
Speaker 1: the gimp is free But Photoshop is like $500.

129
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:05,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, the gimp can almost do everything Photoshop does.

130
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,680
Speaker 0: there's no free flash.

131
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,363
Speaker 1: Yeah A lot of people.

132
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:15,560
Speaker 1: what they do is they make a program that does almost everything or everything that Photoshop does and as good as the third level software.

133
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,339
Speaker 1: But it only cost them a little bit and they sell it on the second level.

134
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,520
Speaker 0: So Adobe of course goes around and buys them up and yep, I don't know if any of you remember a program called cool edit.

135
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:27,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were a bunch of other ones too.

136
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:30,728
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, there's an awesome awesome program.

137
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,720
Speaker 0: It was cheap and it did a good job of manipulating audio.

138
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:50,360
Speaker 0: They bought it and they're selling the same product for almost an order of magnitude more money Though someone in the forum pointed out today or yesterday or whenever there was posted that uh My diet or what I eat is scientifically back to be the healthy way to live.

139
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:54,760
Speaker 1: So there's a New York Times article that you know supported this a long time ago.

140
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:55,402
Speaker 1: I mean like.

141
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,511
Speaker 1: I just knew it like intuitively.

142
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:59,459
Speaker 1: In fact, it's called intuitive dieting, isn't it?

143
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

144
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:05,100
Speaker 1: and then the New York Times came out with an article I love it because like there are things that I kind of know.

145
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:09,920
Speaker 1: You know and I know because I know the stuff that contradicts it is wrong.

146
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:10,743
Speaker 1: But I don't.

147
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:15,120
Speaker 1: I never have evidence that I'm right except for the fact that everything else anyone has said I know is wrong.

148
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:25,319
Speaker 1: And then I'll find an article on Google News that says Scott was right and I'll be like, yeah They see I was right again and it happened in the New York Times, but now it happened again double-plus

149
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:38,179
Speaker 0: yep, basically all that all the studies say is that the best way to be healthy and to not be obese and or to lose Weight is to eat everything you crave whenever you crave it and if you're not hungry don't eat.

150
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:46,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty confident that anyone who's not fat because of genetic reasons or glandular problems is Simply they eat when they're not hungry.

151
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:53,729
Speaker 0: or actually a lot of people really really underestimate the number of calories They eat all but some of them don't even think about.

152
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,020
Speaker 1: they don't even have a good like number in their head.

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,231
Speaker 1: They don't understand how many calories equals how much fatness is.

154
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,740
Speaker 1: how many you're supposed to eat is how many is in the food?

155
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,428
Speaker 1: They just it just to see your numbers.

156
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,234
Speaker 1: They don't understand it.

157
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,119
Speaker 1: They don't even think about it.

158
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,680
Speaker 0: Well, I did see a study a while ago of people who were obese and who were dieting and counting calories.

159
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:21,620
Speaker 0: And they were supposed to they eat they eat but they catalog what they eat and then they calculate the calories and they keep it To you know, fifteen hundred two thousand calories a day, whatever and they were still gaining weight.

160
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:33,020
Speaker 0: So then the scientists had observers follow them around and independently And properly count how many calories they were eating and they were underestimating by an order of magnitude.

161
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:38,697
Speaker 0: They were eating thousands upon thousands more calories than they thought they were just because they didn't calculate properly.

162
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:39,540
Speaker 0: They said no idea.

163
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,320
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if you're dumb enough to eat when you're not hungry, you're dumb enough to not be able to do math.

164
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Don't know.

165
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:48,531
Speaker 1: I was always cuz.

166
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,537
Speaker 1: I knew that you know.

167
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:56,180
Speaker 1: my whole life I've been eating all kinds of crap foods and every healthy foods ate like steaks and chocolates and whatever the hell.

168
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,743
Speaker 1: I never thought about health food and health food always tasted bad and I said screw that crap It's not see whatever I crave.

169
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,068
Speaker 0: I mean when I was a kid I craved dr.

170
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:10,102
Speaker 0: Pepper and I drank, you know Eat whatever.

171
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:13,171
Speaker 1: I wanted then to live long and eat health food.

172
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:13,713
Speaker 1: I didn't want.

173
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,800
Speaker 1: so then, you know, I never turned fat.

174
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,140
Speaker 1: So I was like and then I saw fat people and I was like, huh?

175
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,972
Speaker 1: Other than like eating McDonald's or something.

176
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:24,479
Speaker 1: That's crazy makes you fat.

177
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,646
Speaker 1: What the hell's going on here?

178
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:27,831
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's scary.

179
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:36,376
Speaker 0: when I was in like elementary school I remember there was there was one fat kid in the whole school Like one and ever ever made fun of him and it was kind of sad.

180
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:37,180
Speaker 0: I felt bad for him.

181
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,160
Speaker 0: There was like the token fat kid.

182
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:43,150
Speaker 0: Now I walk past elementary school and they're all fat.

183
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, like every other kid.

184
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,562
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

185
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:53,760
Speaker 1: I see when I was in elementary school There was one kid who was large, but he was generic genetically large like we could sit on his lap.

186
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,671
Speaker 1: He was so large and there was another kid who was it was like fat, but he wasn't fat like Blob you fat he was blood.

187
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,620
Speaker 1: He was like a big guy like hey, what's up?

188
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,599
Speaker 1: Jolly kind of fat.

189
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:15,860
Speaker 1: There weren't any really like slobbily fat guys in my school But like, you know in high school, there were a few of them that walked around the building.

190
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,955
Speaker 1: I guess I'm not from a big fat area You know, but I see these people in the street.

191
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,088
Speaker 1: No, I see them all over the place.

192
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,459
Speaker 0: I gotta get by him in the tiny hallways in the factory at work.

193
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're no fat.

194
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,855
Speaker 1: Is there any fat people at my work?

195
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,631
Speaker 1: I Don't think we really hire fat people.

196
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:34,859
Speaker 0: You hired the chain chomp.

197
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:36,909
Speaker 1: That's an old lady.

198
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,079
Speaker 1: I think she's been there for a long time.

199
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:40,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, she has scary teeth.

200
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,418
Speaker 1: That's why they call it the chain chomp.

201
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:49,976
Speaker 1: so Tomorrow Google is expected to release Google Calendar.

202
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,025
Speaker 1: Ooh No, you know Okay, cool.

203
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,711
Speaker 1: Google new thing, whatever.

204
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,839
Speaker 1: I don't understand the whole calendar thing.

205
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,986
Speaker 0: Some people use calendars.

206
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,090
Speaker 0: I don't I don't.

207
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:02,435
Speaker 1: what would he would?

208
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,800
Speaker 1: can you not remember what you're doing?

209
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,523
Speaker 1: Are you doing?

210
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:16,279
Speaker 1: if you're a guy who does so many things that you need a calendar to keep track of like every hour every day because you have a meeting and then a Presentation and then a trip and then an office and then who knows if you need to do that?

211
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,910
Speaker 1: You're big enough and important enough to have someone who does it for you.

212
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

213
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,420
Speaker 0: I can see it from a business sense.

214
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:27,545
Speaker 0: I mean I use my calendar at work exclusive extensively Because people will.

215
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:34,890
Speaker 0: just I have meetings scheduled all the time all over the place in weird places with weird people And I don't even care enough to remember where to go.

216
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's just every day I look in my calendar and says oh I have to meet this guy this time this guy this time.

217
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:45,957
Speaker 0: But every company that does that gives you some sort of calendaring thing.

218
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:46,599
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

219
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,849
Speaker 0: So I really like Yahoo calendar.

220
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,793
Speaker 0: a lot of people use it.

221
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 0: I don't yeah.

222
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,126
Speaker 1: I mean like I could see calendar.

223
00:14:54,186 --> 00:15:01,414
Speaker 1: the only use I would have for a calendar is like some sort of event notification like a Page I could go to to look at.

224
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,585
Speaker 1: that would say Here are the things that are.

225
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,320
Speaker 1: I could click on a day or a time and it would tell me if there's anything cool happening.

226
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:11,058
Speaker 1: It's like I could turn on my blackberry and be like, is there anything cool I can go to?

227
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:11,400
Speaker 1: right now?

228
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,180
Speaker 1: Here's where I'm at and it would say yeah, there's a cool happening.

229
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,456
Speaker 1: You might like over here, but I don't need a whole calendar application for that.

230
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:19,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't.

231
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,320
Speaker 1: I just need something where I put in the position and the date and time and it gives me a list of events.

232
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:28,600
Speaker 0: Like we don't need something to tell us Otakon's coming up because we're thinking about Otakon now.

233
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:40,728
Speaker 1: yeah, and I don't need something to tell me how to do my everyday stuff because Every day is pretty much almost the same, you know, and I do whatever I want, you know I just go to work do work come home.

234
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,915
Speaker 1: Do what I want go back to work.

235
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that takes me off.

236
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,855
Speaker 0: I miss the college days where I did crazy difference every day.

237
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:54,880
Speaker 1: I did a different crazy thing Yeah, but even then I learned my schedule I memorized it and like inside of the week and then nine weeks I had it memorized.

238
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:58,793
Speaker 0: Like every day was different and it was real easy to skip classes.

239
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:05,590
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I can't skip work But I don't know why.

240
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,199
Speaker 1: can't people remember what they're supposed to do?

241
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:08,484
Speaker 0: I don't know.

242
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,658
Speaker 0: Maybe the life hackers should help them out.

243
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:11,704
Speaker 1: I don't know.

244
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:12,869
Speaker 1: a lot of those life hackers.

245
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,054
Speaker 1: half the stuff they do is Randy.

246
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just kind of silly Mm-hmm.

247
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:19,920
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sure a lot of people use the Google Calendar.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,944
Speaker 1: It'll let people.

249
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:24,540
Speaker 1: at least let people share what they're doing so you could look and see what your friends doing.

250
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:27,440
Speaker 0: But yeah, but I don't like that for the same reason.

251
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:55,513
Speaker 0: I don't like LiveJournal, but I'm not hating on it because a lot of people we know use LiveJournal, but basically, what I've seen is that a lot of people I know who have a LiveJournal if You like if you fall out of contact with them and you don't talk to them every day like you used to Instead of talking to them to find out what they're doing They just they post everything their LiveJournal and you can be friends with someone for years after you stop talking to them And you'll still know exactly what they're up to and they'll know what you're up to.

252
00:16:55,573 --> 00:17:00,745
Speaker 0: but you never talk anymore And when you talk to each other you have nothing to say Mm-hmm.

253
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:01,509
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

254
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,360
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of LiveJournal.

255
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,869
Speaker 0: In fact, I make a point of not reading people's LiveJournals.

256
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:08,154
Speaker 1: I won't read.

257
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:09,859
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not LiveJournal the system.

258
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,210
Speaker 1: That's a problem, but I won't read a LiveJournal.

259
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,680
Speaker 1: if there's a thing that happens to be on the LiveJournal system I don't care, but I won't read a LiveJournal the way other people do though.

260
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,776
Speaker 0: Actually, it leaves a lot of interesting conversations.

261
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,192
Speaker 0: I call a friend I haven't talked to in a long time like hey, what's up?

262
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:28,852
Speaker 0: And they say oh Read my LiveJournal and I say I don't what even up to.

263
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:34,745
Speaker 0: and then they talk to me for an hour instead of just you Know, I don't know hanging up Sending me a link to their LiveJournal.

264
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just don't call people unless I have something to say to them.

265
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:39,320
Speaker 0: Hey there quagmire.

266
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,039
Speaker 0: Hey, what you doing?

267
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,065
Speaker 1: Nothing you called me Mm-hmm.

268
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:51,668
Speaker 0: Granted I do that a lot.

269
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,580
Speaker 0: I actually talk on the phone quite a bit woman.

270
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, what can I say?

271
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:57,429
Speaker 0: I'm very European woman.

272
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,214
Speaker 0: I'm very continental European guys.

273
00:17:59,254 --> 00:17:59,796
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

274
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:00,839
Speaker 1: Hey there hate to tell you.

275
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:13,054
Speaker 0: Actually according to a lot of studies they have tests of you know masculinity and femininity and the American idea of masculinity is Far different from the European idea.

276
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:14,160
Speaker 1: Oh, of course, of course.

277
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,160
Speaker 1: But European guys still don't just call other European guys and say hey what you doing?

278
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:25,120
Speaker 0: Actually, they do not a lot but more often than Americans who seem to avoid any contact with other males.

279
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,524
Speaker 0: That doesn't involve drinking or sports.

280
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:31,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's some but you know, not all and we're seeing that change.

281
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,233
Speaker 1: a Lot of people are hanging it out doing all kinds of other stuff.

282
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:38,087
Speaker 1: Well, at least geeks are well At least the Internet's bringing them together.

283
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:58,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all the people who aren't on the internet boat Yep, all right.

284
00:18:58,895 --> 00:18:59,836
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day.

00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:33,784
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I'm sure you'll see them at your next gaming convention game store where they sell your Plushie products.

307
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably overpriced as those things tend to be.

308
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:37,617
Speaker 0: but what are you gonna do?

309
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,305
Speaker 0: Yeah Considering that we have a kid.

310
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:45,400
Speaker 1: It looks like to be the same quality as the actual plushie toy, which is high quality.

311
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, only I think the plushie toy was 40 bucks.

312
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,180
Speaker 1: So this being 30 and you get two of them.

313
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:51,444
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

314
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:54,676
Speaker 0: But we have a lot of high quality weird plushies like that.

315
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:55,499
Speaker 0: You wouldn't expect us.

316
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,789
Speaker 0: We got the Cactuar.

317
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,331
Speaker 1: Yep.

318
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,320
Speaker 1: Well, it's it's all about the high quality plushie.

319
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,285
Speaker 0: So moving on from our main bit.

320
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:15,436
Speaker 1: It's time for another edition of how not to suck.

321
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,839
Speaker 1: how not to suck at money.

322
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:31,839
Speaker 0: Oh the greens the gold the Platinum's the doubloons the rupees Yeah, so Scott found an article that he'll talk about in a minute.

323
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:39,671
Speaker 0: and Basically, we discovered that despite the fact that from my perception I piss money away on stupid things on a regular basis

324
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:41,779
Speaker 1: and I buy freaking every video game I see

325
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:47,660
Speaker 0: I just head down to the city on a train like all the time and eat food out constantly.

326
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:53,805
Speaker 1: I drive places when I know it'd be cheaper to take a train or vice versa and Buy food.

327
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:54,850
Speaker 1: just yeah.

328
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that vending machines a ripoff, but I don't care.

329
00:21:57,361 --> 00:22:06,375
Speaker 0: We had two expensive dinners in two days over the weekend, and I'm still just fine Yep, but apparently a lot of people really really suck at dealing with money.

330
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,720
Speaker 1: Uh Just about everybody.

331
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,446
Speaker 1: So I read this article.

332
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:18,800
Speaker 1: I think it was business week or some other one of those magazines I don't really remember because I didn't go to work today where it was in the bathroom.

333
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, you found it in the bathroom in the bathroom.

334
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,700
Speaker 1: They replaced the nice Forza magazine with the Ferraris in it.

335
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,787
Speaker 1: I'm kind of upset, but anyway Hey, we're talking about how.

336
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,420
Speaker 1: you know people are having a hard time these days with debt.

337
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,905
Speaker 1: You know they go to school they get these student loans.

338
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:35,568
Speaker 1: You know then they have to pay 200 $300 a month.

339
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:42,099
Speaker 1: You know their jobs don't pay so much They're just pay more than ours.

340
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:46,170
Speaker 1: And You know and and these people?

341
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:57,414
Speaker 1: it said that the average credit card debt For people between the ages of 24 and 34 25 and 35 or something around there was fifty four hundred dollars.

342
00:22:57,675 --> 00:23:06,399
Speaker 1: good god now They gave examples of people and the first example was a lady who made sixty thirty year old lady who made sixty thousand dollars a year.

343
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:10,032
Speaker 1: She had to be three hundred dollars a month for student loans.

344
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:14,479
Speaker 1: her loan was the same size as mine But mine is two hundred a month.

345
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:20,260
Speaker 1: But I I'll be paid off before I'm 30 if I just make the payments and don't do anything else.

346
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and it was like oh if you get a master's degree.

347
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:26,459
Speaker 1: You're screwed even more, but you know not so much.

348
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:35,085
Speaker 1: and Somehow her making let's see 33% more money than me.

349
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:40,880
Speaker 1: and Oh my money plus 50% is how much he makes.

350
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,082
Speaker 1: and then Paying less.

351
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:47,113
Speaker 1: you know about the same amount for student loans and things.

352
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:49,200
Speaker 1: she has fifty four hundred dollars of credit card debt.

353
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:50,405
Speaker 1: Where'd that come from?

354
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,494
Speaker 0: yeah like what do people spend their money on?

355
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:53,860
Speaker 0: I buy stupid crap?

356
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,178
Speaker 0: I buy anime and just garbage constantly, and I still have plenty of money, and I make far less money than these people.

357
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:06,638
Speaker 1: yeah Well the number one rule of how not to suck with money Don't live above the means.

358
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

359
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:09,568
Speaker 1: too many people.

360
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:12,157
Speaker 1: they decide on what their level of living is.

361
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:21,871
Speaker 1: you know they say I am a person who lives in a car in a house with four bedrooms in a two-car garage and two SUVs Regardless of how much money they make.

362
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:27,659
Speaker 1: if you do it that way Unless you happen to be making more money than that you know then you're in a big pooper.

363
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:33,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to look at how much money you make and then decide how well you're gonna live.

364
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,312
Speaker 1: You know based on the money.

365
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:48,081
Speaker 1: if you only make 30 G's you got to live a 30 G lifestyle or else you're gonna be poor real real soon Plus just poor decisions in general like say you want an Xbox 360.

366
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:52,959
Speaker 0: If you buy it now you pretty much have to buy the full-on bundle and you're out a whole shit ton of money.

367
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:53,705
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

368
00:24:54,028 --> 00:25:00,239
Speaker 0: if you wait till like February and you buy one You'll probably be better off.

369
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:03,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what are you gonna gain by buying it now?

370
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:08,539
Speaker 1: if you buy it now You'll gain a tiny bit of social currency for like maybe a week or two.

371
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:12,838
Speaker 1: You know people coming to your house to go ooh and a bunch of crap launch games.

372
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,707
Speaker 1: of course It might backfire on you.

00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:15,430
Speaker 1: people might go out.

374
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,259
Speaker 1: Here's the poser trying to get one real quick.

375
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:18,526
Speaker 1: You know what?

376
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:21,460
Speaker 1: what are you really paying if you buy it on eBay for $1,000?

377
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,106
Speaker 1: What is that really doing for you?

378
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,696
Speaker 0: You mean you know how many were sold on eBay.

379
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:27,181
Speaker 1: you're paying 800.

380
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:32,760
Speaker 1: You know maybe $600 more than you know what the thing normally costs or what you could buy it for.

381
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,657
Speaker 1: You know in a couple months from now Dollars or $800 worth of stuff out of that.

382
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:41,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I mean for 800 bucks.

383
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:42,930
Speaker 0: I could live it up.

384
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:45,137
Speaker 1: Oh man for 800 bucks.

385
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,425
Speaker 1: Wow Wow, I could buy.

386
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:54,390
Speaker 0: I'd buy every anime box that I've been waiting for for a long time and every board game I've ever wanted and I'd have a lot money left.

387
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd gain interest on it in the bank.

388
00:25:58,822 --> 00:25:59,143
Speaker 1: What else?

389
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,852
Speaker 1: one of the mistakes do people make with money uh?

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,252
Speaker 0: Don't buy a car if you don't need one.

391
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:07,938
Speaker 1: don't buy an SUV.

392
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:17,778
Speaker 1: well Don't buy a car that uses more gas than you can afford or cost more than you can afford And don't drive it if you don't have to.

393
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,560
Speaker 1: Like.

394
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:24,076
Speaker 1: you know just because it might be convenient don't drive up and down the road ten times a day.

395
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,160
Speaker 1: go all out at once.

396
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:29,809
Speaker 1: You know cuz gas is a lot a lot of money that adds up if you keep using the car.

397
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:36,377
Speaker 1: and You know no matter how much fun you might think the SUV is or how trendy you think you'll be.

398
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,859
Speaker 1: guess what you're not gonna Stand out in a sea of SUVs.

399
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:45,220
Speaker 1: It's cheaper to buy a freaking like Ford Mustang sports car and more fuel-efficient than to buy a Ford Explorer.

400
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:49,460
Speaker 0: You can get a freaking Lotus Elis a for not that much money.

401
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get a Lotus Elis a is 40 G's.

402
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:58,760
Speaker 1: a Ford Explorer I think is 40 G's or maybe 30, but you know it's only like five to ten thousand dollars more.

403
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,655
Speaker 1: But you'll save that money in gas in a year.

404
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:12,200
Speaker 1: if you use the car free Lotus as just a Toyota Celica engine and it weighs nothing You use barely any gas it goes really fast, and you can turn on a dime.

405
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:19,632
Speaker 1: You can't take anything with you besides you and maybe a passenger Maybe you and a grocery that has more space into the friggin mr.

406
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:20,234
Speaker 0: 2 spider.

407
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:25,310
Speaker 1: yeah, and if you got a big family You know you can get a minivan even though you'll be uncool.

408
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay sure you'll be slightly uncool.

409
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,294
Speaker 1: is being Uncool is being cooler worth ten thousand dollars.

410
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:33,219
Speaker 0: I don't know.

411
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,812
Speaker 0: yeah I'll tell you what I could buy a ten thousand dollars worth of cool.

412
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:37,360
Speaker 0: That wouldn't include a big car.

413
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,363
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about this.

414
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:43,160
Speaker 1: if you buy a minivan instead of an SUV right you can get all those fancy minivan features like.

415
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,311
Speaker 1: it Has little TV players in there and stuff right.

416
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:47,019
Speaker 1: you'll still save 10 G's.

417
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:51,660
Speaker 1: You can use the 10 G's to buy a projector in your house in a home theater, and then you'll be wicked cool.

418
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:57,742
Speaker 0: Like our friend Alex he drives a minivan around and we're always glad when he comes cuz we can all pile into it and go Do geekery.

419
00:27:57,982 --> 00:28:03,356
Speaker 1: yeah, don't be you know a stupid fashion type person buying like you know the $300 jeans or anything.

Speaker 1: You're gonna pay.

423
00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:10,103
Speaker 0: Of course.

424
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:13,040
Speaker 0: one big big thing you can do is you know not have cable TV anymore?

425
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, that costs a lot of money.

426
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:16,940
Speaker 1: cable TV does cost a lot of money.

427
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,147

431
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,730
Speaker 1: You just get a myth TV.

432
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:43,428
Speaker 0: You don't have to pay the TiVo bill yeah, and Netflix is like less than 20 bucks a month and It's more movies than we'll ever have time to watch.

433
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,243
Speaker 1: and the other thing is if you're not spending all your time watching TV Maybe you can spend your time doing other things You know.

434
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:54,378
Speaker 1: maybe make some money or learn some skills that might get you a raise at your job, or you know.

435
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,134
Speaker 0: granted I don't think many of our listeners watch much TV anyway.

436
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:58,684
Speaker 0: That's good You know.

437
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,675
Speaker 0: at least I would assume you know when we were kids.

438
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:01,419
Speaker 0: we watch a lot of TV.

439
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,660
Speaker 1: That's kind of why you know I stopped watching TV when I got to college.

440
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of why podcasts are so great.

441
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:16,675
Speaker 1: so I can still get some sort of push programmed media But it's interesting and targeted to me And I don't have to actually stop doing what I'm doing on the computer to do it.

442
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,986
Speaker 1: like if I have to visit a web Page I have to stop working.

443
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,740
Speaker 1: podcast goes right through work simultaneous.

444
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:22,484
Speaker 1: I like it.

445
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,835
Speaker 1: TV can't do anything.

446
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:29,748
Speaker 1: while you're watching TV I can play like Mario Kart yeah But then you're not really getting the TV at all.

447
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,718
Speaker 0: you're just playing Mario Kart because there's so much to get ever since.

448
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,706
Speaker 0: uh You know every good show was cancelled.

449
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, the Simpsons is still going.

450
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:40,760
Speaker 1: something else You can get rid of is your home telephone.

451
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:45,818
Speaker 1: Haha, just go for the cell phone alone, and don't have a phone line in your house.

452
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:46,320
Speaker 1: You don't need it.

453
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:50,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, right we haven't had a phone line since college And that's just because they gave us one.

454
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,233
Speaker 0: we didn't pay for it.

455
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,120
Speaker 1: sure even if you had one Have you used it for years and years and years?

456
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,318
Speaker 1: It's only a slight pain in the ass to change it you know and then once you change it You're changed and now you can use your cell phone for everything.

457
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:05,673
Speaker 1: yeah Cell phones definitely cheaper also for the long distance.

458
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:08,763
Speaker 1: if you call anyone far away No gouging.

459
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:11,920
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever paid long distance on a phone ever.

460
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,779
Speaker 0: I've had a cell phone pretty much as long as I've used phones for things.

461
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:22,739
Speaker 0: My first cell phone was one of those giant bricks that lasted about 45 minutes if you actually tried to talk on it.

462
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:28,837
Speaker 0: My mom got it for me because she thought it would keep me secure or safe or something in case I ever got in a car accident.

463
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,145
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

464
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,682
Speaker 0: I still have it laying around somewhere Mmm.

465
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:42,839
Speaker 1: Oh oh the number one way to save money when you do have to buy things even though they may be expensive is To do lots and lots of research and not be dumb.

466
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:45,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that just boils down to.

467
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,247
Speaker 0: don't listen to the guy at Best Buy He doesn't know what he's talking about.

468
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:53,408
Speaker 1: yeah like when you go to buy a car Don't buy a car cuz it's cool.

469
00:30:53,468 --> 00:31:03,260
Speaker 1: Don't buy a car because the dealer tells you to do your own Research on the internet and in books and things and what is good for you and decide based on that.

470
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:07,940
Speaker 1: Completely ignore anything superficial like brand and color and whatever.

471
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:10,290
Speaker 0: And well I care about matters.

472
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:13,398
Speaker 1: well, okay, yeah, but You know what I'm saying?

473
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,626
Speaker 0: More importantly be an asshole.

474
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,360
Speaker 0: once you find what you want go and get that and don't settle for less.

475
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, walk into the car.

476
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:22,175
Speaker 0: dealer pointed a car and say give me that one for this price.

477
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,280
Speaker 0: if they say no walk away.

478
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:24,828
Speaker 1: Yep, no one had.

479
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,014
Speaker 1: you don't have to do what anyone says.

480
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,120
Speaker 1: you're the guy with the money.

481
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,027
Speaker 1: You're buying stuff.

482
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,720
Speaker 1: if they don't want to sell it to you give them the finger.

483
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,089
Speaker 1: You know when you go to buy.

484
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:33,254
Speaker 1: what else is a big purchase?

485
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,708
Speaker 1: if you're gonna buy a computer Don't buy a computer from Dell.

486
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,136
Speaker 1: don't get the little insurance plans.

487
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:40,960
Speaker 1: don't buy the accessories.

488
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,132
Speaker 1: Just figure you know.

490
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:53,447

491
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,060
Speaker 0: you got to know a geek who can build a computer.

492
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:59,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like I look on Dell comm and I see a computer for like a thousand dollars.

493
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:05,254
Speaker 1: I could build it for three hundred dollars And it would be better and faster, and you'd never need to upgrade it ever.

494
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:09,718
Speaker 1: you know that thousand dollar Dell is missing pieces never upgraded ever.

495
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:13,014
Speaker 1: eh Well, I guess if you didn't want to play games.

496
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,140
Speaker 1: You wouldn't have to upgrade it ever.

497
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:17,311
Speaker 0: Grant I'm still running a freaking Thunderbird gigahertz.

498
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:18,216

00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,515
Speaker 1: don't do drugs either.

504
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,860
Speaker 1: drugs will take away all your money.

505
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember the the geeky fable about Duane.

506
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to be Duane.

507
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:43,222
Speaker 1: Yeah Anything that addicts people I mean even like Farc.

00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,349
Speaker 1: well FARC doesn't cost money.

509
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,243
Speaker 0: well as it does you pay or cost money if you lose your job because all you do is Read FARC.

510
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:50,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, well don't pay for FARC.

511
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:51,920
Speaker 1: I guess you're not paying for it.

512
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,791
Speaker 0: That's a lot of people pay for total FARC.

513
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:59,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's probably not a good idea Now if you have trouble Closing your web browser now.

514
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:02,020
Speaker 0: Don't get total FARC He'll just sit there until you starve.

515
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,434
Speaker 1: He has a good example of when to know to pay for something and when not to let.

516
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:07,728
Speaker 1: I played puzzle pirates when it was Like beta and free.

517
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,260
Speaker 1: cuz I hear free and I like pirates.

518
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:11,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a good game And I had some funny fun puzzles in.

519
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,180
Speaker 1: it wasn't like an MMO where you level up.

520
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,794
Speaker 1: It was just puzzles all right and money collection, but you can get money so easily.

521
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,220
Speaker 1: it wasn't even like a contest.

522
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,306
Speaker 1: And then it was.

523
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:22,899
Speaker 1: they said pay 50 bucks for like two three years.

524
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:24,167
Speaker 1: So I'm like all right.

525
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:28,508
Speaker 1: 50 bucks is what I usually pay for a video game And I usually play a video game for maybe a year.

526
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:31,759
Speaker 1: if not if not even like a few months all right.

527
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:33,730
Speaker 1: So 50 bucks for three years.

528
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,018
Speaker 1: That's like a freaking deal.

529
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:42,180
Speaker 1: It's I paid for it And then it ran out and I stopped playing long before it ran out as I expected and I stopped playing.

530
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,790
Speaker 1: If an MMO was like pay $50 a year.

531
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:50,410
Speaker 1: I'd be like no Because the formula of that is a dick to you.

532
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,213
Speaker 1: and take your money.

533
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,141
Speaker 1: take your money take your money take your money take your Money.

534
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:56,920
Speaker 0: yep, they do that with talk with total FARC - cuz I had FARC.

535
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:03,198
Speaker 0: I read FARC a lot more than I should I post on it a lot and one day someone sponsored me for total FARC.

536
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:10,034
Speaker 0: some Total Farker must have liked me enough or hated me enough to spend money to give me total FARC for a month.

537
00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:13,808
Speaker 0: Wow oh my god There were just a million.

538
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:18,130
Speaker 0: I basically was infinite entertainment Infinite news constantly.

539
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,060
Speaker 0: it was a sea of updating.

540
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:26,426
Speaker 1: So not only will that take away your job, but and your money Hey, it just ruined you.

541
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:35,775
Speaker 1: yeah Wow No really yeah really Volcano look yeah, don't spend your time making photoshops, and you're supposed to be working anything.

542
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:39,279
Speaker 0: Yeah quiet I thought my Asian bird flu haha guy was hilarious.

543
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,607
Speaker 0: Maybe.

544
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:50,675
Speaker 1: oh Another good way not to lose money is It's okay to have like you know a hobby, but don't get into a hobby.

545
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:53,926
Speaker 1: That's like collecting Expensive useless things.

546
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,373
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people.

547
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:55,956
Speaker 1: you know where.

548
00:34:56,138 --> 00:35:06,800
Speaker 1: otherwise They're just perfectly good people, but they have an infinite number of like PVC robots Yeah, or they'll spend their time collecting comic books, and they'll go and they'll spend like a thousand dollars for comic book.

549
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,770
Speaker 1: You know it's like all right.

550
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:13,920
Speaker 1: I understand You know collecting you want to have a nice collection, and you know show it off, and it makes you feel good.

551
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:24,144
Speaker 1: But when it comes to something like you know a statue Well you can just get the replica of the statue or the look thing that looks the same and does the same things But isn't the original?

552
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:30,852
Speaker 1: for much less you know and no one will know or care except you Just get over it and you can save yourself a freaking fortune.

553
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:33,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, or be like our friend Scott Johnson.

554
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:35,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you a video game.

555
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:35,871
Speaker 0: some of them are good enough.

556
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:39,366
Speaker 0: you buy them on opening day like they come out and you Immediately take how many beat it.

557
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:40,250
Speaker 1: that's usually just cuz.

558
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:47,200
Speaker 1: I have no other games left and when a new one comes out I can go get it, but most games wait and buy him in the discount bin for like five bucks.

559
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:54,016
Speaker 0: Say with anime our friend Scott Johnson every time we go to a convention We we all leave with you know we go to the dealer's room.

560
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:54,640
Speaker 0: We buy crap.

561
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:58,780
Speaker 0: He'll leave with like 50 DVDs and a giant sack of crap.

562
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:06,185
Speaker 0: And then we ask him how much he spent and it's almost nothing because he pretty much just rooted around in bargain bins and bought Yesterday's hotness.

563
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,373
Speaker 1: yep, I mean he gets you know.

564
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:14,659
Speaker 1: you look at the individual deals there And it's like you know get five for the price of three, and you're like all right.

565
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:27,500
Speaker 1: But when he keeps going around getting every single deal starting from the best going to like you know like a limit And then when you look at the sum total, it's like he got 60% off the total price of things.

566
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:33,057
Speaker 0: It's like wow granted the drawback of that is we were subjected to some bad anime as a result of him.

567
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:35,671
Speaker 1: Yeah What was that one called?

568
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:35,732
Speaker 1: Oh?

569
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,204
Speaker 1: God Super Atrogan, I was okay Was he?

570
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:43,709
Speaker 1: definitely I could have done without it.

571
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,117
Speaker 1: Yes wasn't a bad anime though.

572
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,608
Speaker 1: anyway Don't give your money to homeless people on the street.

573
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,935
Speaker 0: don't give your money to a Scientologists.

574
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:56,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't join a cult.

575

Speaker 1: Don't give your money to wacky religion.

576
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:07,218
Speaker 1: Don't give your money to pretty much anything unless You you're getting something out of it, or you know it's you know a charity.

577
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:07,680
Speaker 1: That's good.

578
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you're gonna give to a charity give to like the Red Cross.

579
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:12,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't give to the United Way.

580
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:17,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, well actually get into that some other podcast, but Red Cross good United Way bad.

581
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,843
Speaker 0: You don't deserve.

582
00:37:19,144 --> 00:37:20,469
Speaker 0: okay UNICEF's all right.

583
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,340
Speaker 1: if you're gonna give money to like something like Child's Play, right?

584
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,716
Speaker 1: You know it's good to give the Child's Play or Red Cross, but don't give more than you got.

585
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:32,594
Speaker 0: yeah You know like actually the worst thing to give your money to is the Salvation Army.

586
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, Salvation Army very bad.

587
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:46,979
Speaker 0: They spend most of their money on administrative garbage and paying their own employees And they spend the rest buying various religious implements to convert people Like they'll go to a starving African village and bring Bibles instead of food.

588
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:52,780
Speaker 0: That's not cool not cool at all and there's nothing to do with the fact that it's Christian.

589
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:56,298
Speaker 0: I mean they could be bringing anything other than food, and I'd be equally pissed.

590
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,936
Speaker 1: yep Let's See what all the things do people spend their money on.

591
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:02,419
Speaker 1: that's dumb.

592
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, do I just turn them to a list of things that are dumb to spend money on because that's pretty much everything.

593
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,718
Speaker 1: yeah Oh, well, here's here's a good thing.

594
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,571
Speaker 1: Don't get a loan for something.

595
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,140
Speaker 1: That's just like stupid.

596
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,424
Speaker 0: Okay, great advice there.

597
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:17,227
Speaker 1: Well.

598
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,089
Speaker 1: You know a lot of people.

599
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:25,500
Speaker 1: they go and like you know they've already got a loan here And they've already got a mortgage there And you know and then they want to make like addition to their house.

600
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,405
Speaker 1: So they get another loan.

601
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,216
Speaker 1: just leave without the freaking addition.

602
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:28,880
Speaker 1: you can't afford it.

603
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,073
Speaker 0: You've already got a loan or maybe you can't afford it, and then you get it.

604
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:33,880
Speaker 0: It's just live within your means.

605
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,254
Speaker 1: It's that simple yeah, but specifically with loans because they have the big interest.

606
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:42,492
Speaker 1: if you get a lot of money You know you want to pay off that.

607
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:45,790
Speaker 1: you know the loan real quick Faster if you know than it's supposed to be.

608
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,085
Speaker 1: if you don't pay a crap ton of interest a lot of times They'll trick you with those payments.

609
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:57,127
Speaker 1: You know and a lot of people aren't quick enough to realize oh The interest adds up to like you know $5,000 over.

610
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,333
Speaker 0: well the worst thing you can do.

611
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:04,359
Speaker 0: or like there are lower loans And then there are negative amortization loans, and then there are balloon loans.

612
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:06,327
Speaker 0: And basically these are loans.

613
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,599
Speaker 0: well you'll owe more at the end than you did at the start.

614
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:16,018
Speaker 0: Loans where you have a low monthly payment, and then after two years you suddenly owe a one-time payment of like 20 grand.

615
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:19,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you weren't paying down the interest.

616
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:24,831
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Money-making schemes are all BS, but you know that.

617
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:37,419
Speaker 0: yeah if anyone says you know you can get rich quick You'd think oh, that's obvious don't fall for a money-making scheme, but we've had a lot of Fairly smart friends put money into stupid stupid things.

618
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:40,514
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I fell for a money-making scheme in middle school once.

619
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,282
Speaker 1: oh really well It was just.

620
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:45,120
Speaker 1: it was contest to win a bunch of games called pandemonium.

621
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,764
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

622
00:39:45,785 --> 00:40:01,795
Speaker 1: and they put an advertisement in the video game magazine That was that showed like a giant TV and every video game system and a giant stereo And it looked freaking out and a satellite dish and everything and all you had to do to enter the contest Was send in this little puzzle that was in the magazine, and it was the simplest puzzle ever.

623
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:04,958
Speaker 1: and I said all right I sent it in with free.

624
00:40:05,941 --> 00:40:09,139
Speaker 1: then they sent me a thing back and said fill out this puzzle and send us a dollar.

625
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:18,740
Speaker 1: and I said and they're like there are five puzzles And I calculated the increase in difficulty of the puzzle that this one wasn't so much more difficult than the previous one.

626
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:20,625
Speaker 1: So I'm like all right.

627
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,569
Speaker 1: It's only a dollar.

628
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,614
Speaker 1: if the next one sucks.

629
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,812
Speaker 1: I won't send it again, right What's it gonna cost?

630
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:25,319
Speaker 1: five bucks?

631
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, the next one came and these people were so good and I was such an impressionable middle school kid that It was.

632
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:34,320
Speaker 1: it was harder, and I felt like it was harder.

633
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,900
Speaker 1: But I was smart enough to figure it out because I was a smart guy and it was five bucks.

634
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,800
Speaker 1: So I'm like yeah five bucks whatever who cares all right?

635
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:40,981
Speaker 1: What?

636
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:45,373
Speaker 1: I didn't have anything to spend five bucks on in those days except like a pack of Magic cards Which were also a ripoff?

637
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:47,425
Speaker 1: It wasn't safe.

638
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:48,370
Speaker 1: It wasn't waste any money.

639
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,134
Speaker 1: those other waste money.

640
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:50,299
Speaker 1: They're wasting money somewhere else.

641
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:59,700
Speaker 1: So they sent me the fourth one which is really freaking hard But I finally got it after like many hours and help from people and they said send ten bucks.

642
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,247
Speaker 1: So I'm like there's only one more.

643
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:02,473
Speaker 1: how much could the last one be?

644
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,820
Speaker 0: was the last one a hundred dollars?

645
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:04,725
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.

646
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:07,320
Speaker 1: the last one is 15 bucks, right?

647
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,668
Speaker 1: So they got 15 plus 10 plus 5 plus 1 so 25 30 31 dollars.

648
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,519
Speaker 1: I sent them which is not so bad, but the last puzzle pretty much.

649
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,213
Speaker 1: they said they had a big open square.

650
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:37,957
Speaker 1: it was just a grid and They had point values assigned to letters of the alphabet all the letters of the alphabet And you had to completely fill this grid right with words in every single possible direction filling every single square and I think it was like a 10 by 10 grid and you also had to get the highest possible score.

651
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:45,178
Speaker 1: and Oh, so I filled out the whole thing using as many Z words as I could because I think it was.

652
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:49,342
Speaker 1: I think Z was A big one and like Q is a big one, you know I take it.

653
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,208
Speaker 0: you didn't win the amazing pile of awesome.

654
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,256
Speaker 1: Do I have an amazing pile of awesome?

655
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:54,400
Speaker 0: No, you do not.

00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,353
Speaker 1: Do I have a neogeo?

657
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,296
Speaker 1: Have an original game boy to have a Sega Saturn to have an original game boy.

658
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:01,978
Speaker 1: Do I have a 3do?

659
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,542

00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:15,712
Speaker 1: I don't have a 50 inch rear projection TV in a satellite dish and a 5,000 watt stereo or anything because it was a scam.

00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:30,269
Speaker 0: It's just.

669
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,640

714
00:44:59,069 --> 00:44:59,792
