1
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,032
Speaker 1: let's do this.

2
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,160
Speaker 2: so I saw you did like a 60 70 mile bike to rock away this weekend.

3
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,048
Speaker 1: no biked everywhere.

4
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,474
Speaker 1: yeah nothing else to do.

5
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:44,249
Speaker 2: yeah because I ended up going to the shore Wildwood and while we were there our friends Chris and Anthony were there and we played that Kickstarter game Scoville.

6
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,698
Speaker 1: no based on peppers.

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,700
Speaker 2: yes you breed peppers and you cross breed them and there's different kinds of peppers.

8
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:58,442
Speaker 2: so I'm not gonna fully review it because Scott's got to play it all bunch and you gotta play it more but you should have to eat peppers to play the game.

9
00:00:58,462 --> 00:00:59,650
Speaker 1: then it would be a good game right?

10
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,576
Speaker 2: that would be interesting.

11
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:08,632
Speaker 1: if the pepper you at the end of each turn whoever has the lowest number of points must eat one of their peppers or something like that.

12
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:14,034
Speaker 2: so the gist of it the way it works is that basically you plant peppers like you play.

13
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:19,199
Speaker 2: everyone plants a pepper like somewhere on the board and then to harvest you walk along the path.

14
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,196
Speaker 2: there's a shared space in the middle and you walk three spaces.

15
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:27,339
Speaker 2: I've seen mechanics like that and ever you crop but you don't walk like square to square.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,894
Speaker 2: you walk along the edges of where the peppers are and you collect the pepper that would be bred by the peppers on either side of each space.

17
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:39,330
Speaker 2: so there's a ghost pepper next to a white pepper.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,378
Speaker 2: then I think daddy gets two white peppers.

19
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:48,751
Speaker 2: or if there's a red pepper and a red pepper get two red peppers but a red and a green or a red and a blue I think makes a brown.

20
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,059
Speaker 2: there's like seven eight.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,504
Speaker 2: now there's like ten or eleven different kinds of peppers mm-hmm and it was a pretty good game.

22
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:56,873
Speaker 2: I'm actually kind of into it.

23
00:01:56,914 --> 00:02:04,890
Speaker 2: now I gotta play it again though we were kind of in a hurry to get on the road to beat the traffic back to New York because we played it on Sunday like right before we left mm-hmm.

24
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:11,296
Speaker 2: but I feel like this game might be up our alley and I might acquire a copy of it.

25
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:13,648
Speaker 1: you acquire all the stuff you want in your house.

26
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:15,437
Speaker 2: oh you're done buying board games.

27
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,106
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be selling a lot of stuff.

28
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:17,648
Speaker 1: I need room.

29
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,778
Speaker 2: yeah thing is very few.

30
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,829
Speaker 2: the board games I own I'm kind of willing.

31
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,258
Speaker 2: the only game I still own that I'm willing to part with is Gloria Mundi because that game is kind of just bad like.

32
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,618
Speaker 1: really I have games that you know don't get played and I don't really care.

33
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:32,201
Speaker 2: do you own it?

34
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:32,984
Speaker 2: you know the clips right.

35
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:35,236
Speaker 1: I got an eclipse but I'll keep my clip.

36
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,186
Speaker 2: oh oh but when are you gonna play that again?

37
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:37,830
Speaker 1: I'll play it.

38
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:41,453
Speaker 2: when it was the last time you opened that eclipse I don't know.

39
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:42,701
Speaker 1: but you never know what an eclipse will happen.

40
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:46,733
Speaker 2: yeah we should just start playing some eclipse.

41
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:50,866
Speaker 1: but I got games like lahav and which is not a you know.

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,542
Speaker 1: okay like turning taxes like these are not bad games but I'm not gonna play them and they're taking up a lot of space relative.

43
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,528
Speaker 1: yeah you know what I realize.

44
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:02,551
Speaker 2: those are the kinds of games that I kind of would want to keep like I have Puerto Rico.

45
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:03,134
Speaker 1: I got T&E.

46
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:06,011
Speaker 2: I'm good but they're good games to own as like a collection of.

47
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,399
Speaker 2: like you have a board game night.

48
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,003
Speaker 2: you're like all right.

49
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:08,326
Speaker 2: here's it.

50
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:09,836
Speaker 2: here's the game you guys have never played.

51
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:10,781
Speaker 1: oh you want him then.

52
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:15,558
Speaker 2: but that sentiment only applied when I lived in a house.

53
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,093
Speaker 1: yeah you want you want those games now that I live in an apartment.

54
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,764
Speaker 2: no you want you want Gloria Mundi.

55
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,814
Speaker 2: no I will keep to call though.

56
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,603
Speaker 1: cuz oh wait Gloria Mundi which one's that?

57
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,273
Speaker 2: the one do you really don't remember?

58
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:25,696
Speaker 1: is that?

59
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:28,511
Speaker 1: is that the one with the god chasing you is the gods chasing you.

60
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:29,698
Speaker 1: oh you should play that.

61
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,105
Speaker 2: that game sucks though?

62
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:31,829
Speaker 1: no it doesn't.

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,216
Speaker 2: you don't remember playing it?

64
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:33,900
Speaker 1: don't remember?

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,664
Speaker 1: it was kind of fun.

66
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:35,570
Speaker 1: run away from the god.

67
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,989
Speaker 2: yeah there that was fun but the actual game just came down to you.

68
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:39,814
Speaker 2: always pay the god.

69
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,397
Speaker 1: well it wasn't.

70
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,708
Speaker 1: let's pay it again one more time as I can remember.

71
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:47,494
Speaker 2: I think the last time we played it was a New Year's party maybe but I forgot about those.

72
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,199
Speaker 2: I could get it out.

73
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,044
Speaker 2: we could play it again if we're.

74
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:52,826
Speaker 2: the thing is if we play it again and do a show on it we're also getting up.

75
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,476
Speaker 1: you did show in it like a hundred years ago.

76
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,633
Speaker 2: how about this though cuz you seem to have fonder memories of it than I do.

77
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,487
Speaker 2: let's bust out to call and Gloria Mundi.

78
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,874
Speaker 1: but it calls okay game.

79
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:03,744
Speaker 2: yeah let's play each once and then review them again.

80
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,031
Speaker 1: there's nothing wrong with the car.

81
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:13,615
Speaker 2: yeah but see like the last time I played to call was actually a long time ago I wonder what if my opinion will change you just having walk around digging up pyramids?

82
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,995
Speaker 2: yeah put your own machine gun guy on top of the one most valuable pyramid right.

83
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,000
Speaker 2: go after the tents.

84
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,290
Speaker 2: except no the tents are never good.

85
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,442
Speaker 1: I hope the volcano shows up at the good time for you.

86
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,064
Speaker 2: yeah.

87
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:29,865
Speaker 2: so uh yeah the main thing going on right now that's been going on for a while it's over now.

88
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,709
Speaker 2: yeah I guess it's completely over right?

89
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:37,806
Speaker 2: I yeah I'll get second.

90
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:38,651
Speaker 2: I guess that was the last day.

91
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,682
Speaker 2: yes as usual it's the miracle.

92
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,392
Speaker 2: we have enough energy to do blah blah blah blah blah.

93
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,282
Speaker 2: so yeah summer games done quick.

94
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,045
Speaker 2: the secret to summer games done quick is to watch them all on YouTube after the fact.

95
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,098
Speaker 2: so you don't get ads like you do in the twitch stream.

96
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:53,050
Speaker 1: I don't get ads in the twitch stream with my ad block.

97
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:55,727
Speaker 2: your ad block - actually I've never used ad block with twitch.

98
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:56,692
Speaker 2: does it just block the ad?

99
00:04:57,034 --> 00:05:01,197
Speaker 1: I mean I'm using you block origin or micro block origin whatever you want to call it.

100
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,718
Speaker 1: but even when I used ad block plus I never see ads on YouTube or on twitch.

101
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,794
Speaker 2: I don't see on YouTube but I see the first ad on twitch.

102
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,307
Speaker 1: I don't see any ad on twitch unless I use like my phone or something.

103
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:18,014
Speaker 2: yeah and the twitch app yeah summer games done quick was a pretty good run this year.

104
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,223
Speaker 1: yeah I mean we already had a GDQ.

105
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,791
Speaker 1: right awesome games done quick.

106
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,681
Speaker 1: so they have two events summer games done quick.

107
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:24,948
Speaker 1: this year it was in like st.

108
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,475
Speaker 1: Paul Minnesota or something.

109
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:34,890
Speaker 1: but they got a surprising turnout of runners showing up to this thing not net runners speed runners who put on quite a display.

110
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,104
Speaker 1: they had four-way Super Metroid race which is always the highlight.

111
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,438
Speaker 1: the correct choice of save the animals was the winner.

112
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,746
Speaker 1: yeah as it was last time as well.

113
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,394
Speaker 1: for the Tetris.

114
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:49,180
Speaker 1: you know the grand master edition.

115
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,237
Speaker 1: you know they put the pretty good show on with that the last time.

116
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:55,432
Speaker 1: this time they brought over people from Japan.

117
00:05:55,452 --> 00:06:00,375
Speaker 1: so they had like probably the best collection of Tetris players ever assembled in a single location.

118
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:06,760
Speaker 2: I was particularly enjoying the gauntlet one because I did not actually know as a kid.

119
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,177
Speaker 2: I bet gauntlet 2. it was the first one I got on the NES.

120
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:15,860
Speaker 2: I played gauntlet in the arcade and I got gauntlet 2 which is pretty much like the arcade on the NES.

121
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,783
Speaker 2: and then later I got gauntlet 1. and how this weird shit like a map and all the stuff I didn't get.

122
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:24,696
Speaker 2: I didn't know you could beat gauntlet 1.

123
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:25,339
Speaker 1: of course you can.

124
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,955
Speaker 1: no I didn't know you just like a lot of money to be gone.

125
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:29,462
Speaker 2: it's gonna - just goes on forever.

126
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:36,475
Speaker 2: but yeah gauntlet 1 the best part about the speed run is he starts going then he gets his password and he's like no no no stop the clock.

127
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:37,902
Speaker 2: we got to start over.

128
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,057
Speaker 2: my password started with an a. the game is unbeatable.

129
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:50,386
Speaker 2: yeah really there's a bug where if your password starts with an a then the game is unbeatable yep because you need to type in that code at the end yep and you won't be able to like it.

130
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:51,552
Speaker 2: just won't happen all right.

131
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:56,173
Speaker 1: other interesting runs that I saw during the weekend of awesomeness.

132
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:59,026
Speaker 1: obviously simply a night race is always a good show.

133
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,928
Speaker 1: yep all right you know it was pretty good - well I mean all the classics are at.

134
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,921
Speaker 1: the ones they have every single time are always good.

135
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:06,348
Speaker 1: that's why they have them every single time.

136
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,585
Speaker 1: right but there was a the majority way to.

137
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:13,033
Speaker 1: the majora's mass is crazy.

138
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,079
Speaker 1: the earthbound was pretty crazy.

139
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,475
Speaker 2: I'm going to watch the chrono trigger the Oregon Trail.

140
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,261
Speaker 1: they had an Apple to GS up ends.

141
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:25,669
Speaker 1: there was a super Noah's Ark 3d that didn't watch it but I want to.

142
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:26,754
Speaker 2: I don't know.

143
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,257
Speaker 2: that's just.

144
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 2: it's just.

145
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,864
Speaker 2: I don't feel like see watching that one that feels like it won't be fun unless I keep very funny.

146
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:37,537
Speaker 1: a lot of the ones that like you're like I'm not sure if I want to watch this are very short and it's like oh it's only like five minutes.

147
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:38,943
Speaker 1: okay let's see what the deal is.

148
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:52,727
Speaker 2: oh yeah like the it wasn't this time it was a while ago but super pitfall is actually a great speedrun to watch even though super pitfalls an awful game because the guy is really really funny and he knows a lot about the game.

149
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:56,318
Speaker 1: yeah there was a crazy Pokemon blue situations going on.

150
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,160
Speaker 1: I have to watch those.

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,501
Speaker 1: still.

152
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:01,673
Speaker 1: there was oh the Taz bot.

153
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:02,778
Speaker 1: you know which is the tool?

154
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:09,672
Speaker 1: assisted speedrun yeah but it played Megaman one and did crazy glitches which is you know kind of interesting for about a minute.

155
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,298
Speaker 1: but the Ikaruga one.

156
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,219
Speaker 1: it basically gets the maximum achievable score to player Ikaruga.

157
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,530
Speaker 1: it's both players are being controlled by the bot.

158
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,989
Speaker 1: and I think the highlight this year was the chrono trigger at the end.

159
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,362
Speaker 1: but I haven't watched that either because it's four hours.

160
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:32,456
Speaker 1: I need to find four hours of time to set aside which is actually a lot less time than it would take for me to play chrono trigger again.

161
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,621
Speaker 2: oh god yeah.

162
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,630
Speaker 1: so I'm like oh I'll just watch this.

163
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,004
Speaker 1: and then I wanted to play chrono trigger again because I think it's a hundred percent chrono trigger 100% co-op runs.

164
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,068
Speaker 2: I guess they switched in and out.

165
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,961
Speaker 2: yeah I guess people you know well there was an incentive for a hundred percent so they didn't have to I guess but I guess more.

166
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,555
Speaker 1: I think I think basically the way it works is like that.

167
00:08:51,635 --> 00:09:04,584
Speaker 1: one of theirs one of his sponsors is the Yeti which is the t-shirt site which isn't bad and the Yeti basically like matches donations that everyone's making you know and also sponsors.

168
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:08,886
Speaker 1: but what they do is they end up actually just sending in their donations just like everyone else does.

169
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,655
Speaker 1: only they're from the Yeti.

170
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:18,030
Speaker 1: so you know they'll be reading off donations and they always read the donations from the Yeti right because it's the big sponsor.

171
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:27,544
Speaker 1: so whenever they read the Yeti donations the Yeti always basically fills in every single incentive with the thousands of dollars you know donating.

172
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:30,156
Speaker 2: but yeah if you you know we talked.

173
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,828
Speaker 2: we mentioned this was coming a long time ago.

174
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:32,896
Speaker 2: then we didn't talk about it again.

175
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,848
Speaker 2: but just go watch all the stuff on YouTube.

176
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:35,854
Speaker 2: some of these are great.

177
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:40,759
Speaker 1: watching live does have a certain you know especially if you got people on Twitter who are talking about it.

178
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,409
Speaker 1: so luckily no one I follow on Twitter.

179
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,877
Speaker 1: the Twitch chat is worthless.

180
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:51,235
Speaker 2: the only one of these that anyone in my like follow group talked about on Twitter was the Chrono Trigger and I avoided spoilers.

181
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,045
Speaker 2: I don't know if they saved Magus or not.

182
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,272
Speaker 1: I don't know how it works either.

183
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:54,714
Speaker 1: they better.

184
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:55,799
Speaker 2: they better save Magus.

185
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:56,462
Speaker 2: fuck frog.

186
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:58,250
Speaker 1: what frog is my man?

187
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,615
Speaker 1: yeah but Magus is so much.

188
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:03,170
Speaker 1: so much sword with also Magus floats on the overworld.

189
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,167
Speaker 2: so make him your leader and like why would you ever do anything else?

190
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:07,012
Speaker 1: so much sword?

191
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,843
Speaker 2: so in other news remember that's old game.

192
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:13,523
Speaker 2: we did a show on this on geek nights like what six years ago longer.

193
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:20,357
Speaker 1: well see it's a very unique and high quality game that's been around for a long time and is you know managed to keep going despite you know yeah

194
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:23,407
Speaker 2: but there is the battle for Wesna

195
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:31,804
Speaker 1: was just like an open-source turn-based strategy game that has had of active community and has gradually improved over years and years and years

196
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:34,519
Speaker 2: or possibly gotten worse because the campaign's kept breaking.

197
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:36,873
Speaker 1: maybe but never played the campaigns.

198
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,042
Speaker 1: we really just played multiplayer.

199
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:39,010
Speaker 2: yeah well the game was it.

200
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:49,192
Speaker 2: it's interesting because this is one of the rare examples of a large game like a very large completely large that I'd say it's very large in terms of the framework.

201
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:54,521
Speaker 2: I mean it has a whole framework and its own scripting language just for making all those scenarios sure.

202
00:10:54,561 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 2: yeah it also has like the backend and the netcode and a significant amount of moderately well-drawn art assets and poorly drawn hard assets.

203
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:04,427
Speaker 1: well it's an open-source game.

204
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,714
Speaker 1: what do you think the heart's gonna be like?

205
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:10,576
Speaker 2: but I'm hard-pressed to name larger open-source game projects.

206
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,489
Speaker 1: oh there was that FPS that was like a quake clone thingy.

207
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,156
Speaker 1: what was that thing called?

208
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:21,623
Speaker 1: I forget yeah there you go but was frozen frozen bubbles usually the example of open-source game right.

209
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,352
Speaker 1: so it was not this pretty great by comparison.

210
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,020
Speaker 2: but was not this having a problem?

211
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:28,557
Speaker 2: apparently there's no one left to write code for it.

212
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:32,213
Speaker 1: oh like the people are starting to quit now that it's been like a 20 year old.

213
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:36,127
Speaker 2: to quote the article the ship is sinking.

214
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:40,556
Speaker 1: the project is that but if someone wrote the ship is sinking that means someone's on the ship to write that it's.

215
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:48,005
Speaker 2: there are a few people on the ship but basically they need people with C++ Python and WML programming.

216
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,895
Speaker 1: well WML is the was not markup language.

217
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:54,210
Speaker 1: nobody knows the Wesnoth markup language unless they're already.

218
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,236
Speaker 1: it was not person.

219
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:57,510
Speaker 1: so you're gonna need people to learn the Wesnoth markup.

220
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,313
Speaker 1: if you

221
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,926
Speaker 2: are a punk kid and you want something to do to like

222
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,805
Speaker 1: and you like turn-based strategy games like Advance Wars only with fantasy themes

223
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:12,016
Speaker 2: yep this project is hurting for developers enough that you can probably have a lot of influence in a hurry

224
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,309
Speaker 1: on a game that a lot of people kind of care about.

225
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:18,809
Speaker 2: yeah but - uh I don't think it's gonna make it and has miners start.

226
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:20,520
Speaker 1: you don't think you think it's gonna be the end of Wesnoth.

227
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,411
Speaker 2: I think Wesnoth is not bloody.

228
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,118
Speaker 1: Foxton has come to be.

229
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:34,847
Speaker 2: Foxton is the final resting place of these sad souls okay so part of the problem I saw is that I was reading through it like slash shot which is not the most but slash does is the very Wesnoth.

230
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,494
Speaker 1: that's a place that was not.

231
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:46,762
Speaker 2: so it's interesting because a lot of accounts with way old numbers on slash shot like my people suddenly appeared suddenly talk about was not yeah and more than one of them was like.

232
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:50,319
Speaker 2: I tried to contribute but the developers are assholes and things.

233
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:55,644
Speaker 2: I believe that I believe that there seems to be an infinite amount of drama around this project.

234
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:56,750
Speaker 1: listen an open-source world.

235
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,198
Speaker 1: somehow assholes get shit done.

236
00:12:58,238 --> 00:12:58,781
Speaker 1: look at Linux.

237
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:09,296
Speaker 2: yeah but I think the problem is that games like this really need like game design independently of the coding and the changes there.

238
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:16,675
Speaker 2: well it's not always had some design issues exactly but the people who were the best coders were also the ones who had a lot of the input over the design.

239
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,206
Speaker 1: you just code and you you set the design right.

240
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:20,912
Speaker 1: yeah there's no director.

241
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,563
Speaker 0: what you're describing right now is open source UX in general.

242
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:31,548
Speaker 2: I mean the gimp is totally fine right sure I haven't I don't know.

243
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:32,694
Speaker 1: maybe the gimps improved now.

244
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,507
Speaker 1: I pay for real photoshop now so I don't know.

245
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,156
Speaker 2: I have real Photoshop and I work out of the gimp.

246
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,288
Speaker 2: so my workflow is do a bunch of stuff.

247
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,556
Speaker 2: why the fuck is this broken?

248
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:41,186
Speaker 2: flatten image continue working?

249
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:43,636
Speaker 2: why the fake leaf is broken flatten image continue going.

250
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,031
Speaker 2: I made a layer once and that ended my project.

251
00:13:48,312 --> 00:14:01,757
Speaker 2: okay but uh I made a layer once Wesnoth just was never quite there and that that WML language kept changing with no backward compatibility and they kept changing gameplay stuff.

252
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,689
Speaker 2: so they had a lot of people who made a lot of.

253
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:14,298
Speaker 2: they change the language without changing the campaign or the coders change subtle gameplay things that broke the campaigns because oh yeah you can't win this one now because that dude just isn't strong enough.

254
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:15,544
Speaker 1: stuff like that.

255
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:21,207
Speaker 2: like there is no way to have dependencies on gameplay in scenarios and vice versa.

256
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:25,245
Speaker 2: there's no way to like snapshot or freeze like sets of game mechanics.

257
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,832
Speaker 2: so the project is such a big mess.

258
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:44,221
Speaker 2: that sure in my opinion unless they freeze that language and they freeze gameplay and design and focus only on fixing the code and bugs and issues for a while and have a stable platform for a while I don't think this thing's ever gonna get beyond where it is right now.

259
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:48,103
Speaker 1: well who knows I haven't played it in years and I wasn't really planning to play it again.

260
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:50,014
Speaker 2: yeah thing is as fun as it was.

261
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,980
Speaker 2: it was no advanced wars.

262
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:51,946
Speaker 1: no it wasn't.

263
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:53,474
Speaker 0: that wasn't Alex working on that.

264
00:14:53,957 --> 00:15:01,853
Speaker 1: I mean he did it for a little bit back and when we were really playing it you know he made I think he made some sprites for it maybe and yeah I did some stuff.

265
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:03,360
Speaker 1: it was way back.

266
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:11,642
Speaker 2: yeah the part of the trouble is the game never got polished enough to be worth investing the time and being great at it partly because the gameplay kept changing.

267
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:16,441
Speaker 2: like I'm good at advanced wars I wouldn't be good at advanced wars like revision 809 build 7.

268
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:21,326
Speaker 1: yeah it's like every time there's new advances you had to relearn it anyway right?

269
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,978
Speaker 1: yeah it's constantly changing.

270
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,065
Speaker 1: it's difficult and you know what that's.

271
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:24,368
Speaker 1: why not?

272
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,052
Speaker 1: runner is awesome.

273
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:36,706
Speaker 2: but yeah I'll link to the slash down article because the comments is a lot of people who know a lot about Wes Knopf pretty much shedding light on things and linking to like old bugs they opened in 2008.

274
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:38,010
Speaker 1: let me show you my Ubuntu bug.

275
00:15:40,812 --> 00:16:07,567
Speaker 2: so but anyway things of the day I want for you an AGD Q not an SDG Q. but this is a game that I was a kid I played and well I rented from blockbuster because it had really good box art and looked like it had good graphics and we my brother and I couldn't get out of like the first two screens and we did not get out of those things

276
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:10,222
Speaker 1: later once and couldn't get past the first two screens.

277
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,976
Speaker 2: yeah in the whole weekend and we took the game back.

278
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:25,463
Speaker 1: I mean I only spent about ten minutes on it and this game haunted me but not enough to go figure it out why this game haunts me because every time I go to a convention magfest packs anywhere and there's always that one booth selling the retro games.

279
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:27,675
Speaker 1: they've got a whole bunch of overpriced NES cartridges.

280
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:32,498
Speaker 1: yeah this game is 100% of the time always in the library and the selection available.

281
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:45,316
Speaker 2: so this is a speedrun of that game and a huge lingering chapter of my childhood unresolved hitherto has henceforth been resolved and I have closure.

282
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:49,070
Speaker 2: also the in this game pretty good kind of catchy yeah.

283
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,651
Speaker 1: so the SGD Q sort of you know always inspires you to try to be a speedrunner.

284
00:16:53,671 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 1: yeah I opened up Mame and I wanted to play Tetris Grandmaster myself and I played it a bit and yeah I couldn't get past like level 100 something and that took me four minutes.

285
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:08,426
Speaker 1: meanwhile four minutes in those guys like at level 900 or whatever just takes practice 800 who knows.

286
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:13,336
Speaker 1: yeah obviously I don't think that there's any amount of practice I could put in that would get me at their level.

287
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,910
Speaker 1: I could be better obviously but not as good as them.

288
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,582
Speaker 1: so while I had my meme open I tried some other things.

289
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:25,097
Speaker 1: I played some Dodon Pachi and whatever and then I realized whoa I'm sitting here with my joystick playing all these arcade games.

290
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:28,215
Speaker 1: you know there's I can just play Street Fighter championship edition.

291
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,992
Speaker 1: it's just right here you know just like the old arcade days.

292
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:31,616
Speaker 1: so I opened it up.

293
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,180
Speaker 1: I start playing.

294
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:33,927
Speaker 1: you know my guy M bison.

295
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:36,397
Speaker 1: yeah and you know this is on arcade.

296
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:37,039
Speaker 1: hard mode.

297
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:42,881
Speaker 1: make you lose quarters mode and I get to review the fifth guy and I just can't win.

298
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,717
Speaker 1: and I was like what the fuck I used to be my that old.

299
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:47,419
Speaker 1: I can't even win.

300
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,331
Speaker 1: and it's like I take a round and then lose two rounds.

301
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,827
Speaker 1: some like let me go on the internet and find a video.

302
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,256
Speaker 1: you know a beating for you.

303
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:57,895
Speaker 1: maybe there's something I'm doing wrong and there was something to doing wrong I forgot.

304
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:05,960
Speaker 1: the thing in that game is that M bison middle kick basically just beats everything because it has so much as so much reach and it has some and it has enough strength.

305
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,693
Speaker 1: you can basically just middle kick your way through the game.

306
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:09,242
Speaker 2: yeah welcome back to my nightmares.

307
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:18,406
Speaker 1: but anyway while I was searching for like you know I want to see a video of someone beating were you like just like destroying him and Street Fighter championship in arcade.

308
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,795
Speaker 1: I found this video on YouTube.

309
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:24,249
Speaker 1: I know none of you have seen this because it has so few views.

310
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:32,822
Speaker 1: it is some dude just some dude who is reminiscing about playing this game and he's playing it and he beats for you.

311
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:35,811
Speaker 1: but the things he said it's like.

312
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:41,814
Speaker 1: this is like some glorious video that is completely hidden on the internet that no one knows.

313
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,401
Speaker 1: it has like maybe tens of you.

314
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,831
Speaker 2: it has 21 views and one like which I assume is you.

315
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,175
Speaker 1: yes that's my life.

316
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:51,888
Speaker 1: this video is worth watching.

317
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:52,511
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

318
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,259
Speaker 1: what's up with this undiscovered guy?

319
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,616
Speaker 1: I didn't even look to see if it is the only other videos both posted on his own published recently but if he does I want to watch them.

320
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:03,435
Speaker 2: here are some random fights in Street Fighter 2 champion edition arcade.

321
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,703
Speaker 2: this is the classic fighting game this.

322
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:06,594
Speaker 2: well there's a lot of description here.

323
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,724
Speaker 2: here's my flicker here's my.

324
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,213

Speaker 1: yeah but whoever?

326
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,379
Speaker 1: I don't even know who this guy is but you just have to watch this and listen to him.

327
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,540
Speaker 2: Alexander's say and look here's a bunch of black and white pictures he took.

328
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,305
Speaker 0: Alexander you are in link is tinder.

329
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:25,323
Speaker 2: let's see flicker another photography another tiger.

330
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,031
Speaker 2: no no whatever.

331
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,850
Speaker 1: but we'll watch this after the show is over and you'll see the glory that this man has made.

332
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,337
Speaker 1: I mean this YouTube video.

333
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:36,613
Speaker 2: in the moment the booklet book is still fantasy book volume one.

334
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,382
Speaker 1: I've read much more of it.

335
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:48,257
Speaker 2: I'm you're probably ahead of me now because I left off when they were in the town after they landed from the ship being stupid again.

336
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:49,262
Speaker 1: yeah I'm a little after that.

337
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,053
Speaker 2: are they still being stupid?

338
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:51,797
Speaker 1: they left that town.

339
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,922
Speaker 2: are all the kids still alive?

340
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:57,637
Speaker 2: yeah I wish just one or two of them would not make it.

341
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,503
Speaker 1: I think the times are coming soon.

342
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,312
Speaker 1: man the wolf sent something.

343
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:08,803
Speaker 2: I just I suspect and I worry that the characters that like the least are the ones who are in the most pages of the wheel of.

344
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:14,813
Speaker 1: there are so many pages though I assume that they'll make newer characters who you may like or hate more or less.

345
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:18,111
Speaker 2: but I pretty much only like adults and hate children so far in these books.

346
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,227
Speaker 2: I don't know if that says anything about the books or about me.

347
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,096
Speaker 1: I have to agree with that anyway.

348
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:27,891
Speaker 2: also we are going to be live at PAX Prime on real packs.

349
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:31,262
Speaker 2: yeah the far future of one true gaming con.

350
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:34,733
Speaker 2: all roads lead to Rome room the mecca of nerds.

351
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,462
Speaker 2: yeah so Sunday far future of gaming.

352
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:45,974
Speaker 2: Monday sports our games which is getting increasingly topical what with the doping scandal in video game tournaments lately?

353
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:57,317
Speaker 2: and then on Wednesday in Portland I am giving a lecture not geek nights just me on UX in video games at Kifu in Portland the computer human interaction forum of Oregon.

354
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,207
Speaker 1: I'm sure so many people show up there.

355
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,536
Speaker 1: it sounds like such a hot place.

356
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:05,846
Speaker 2: a lot of people go to this thing like Mike Seliger lectured not too long ago and I know who that is bunch of packs that people were there.

357
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:16,461
Speaker 2: so okay apparently someone from packs dev knew us and saw me lecture at another packs and nominated me to be a lecturer here.

358
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,429
Speaker 2: so that's how that happened as far as I could tell.

359
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,919
Speaker 2: okay so yeah we got up.

360
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,374
Speaker 2: we got Conrad Kraling here in the studio if you didn't notice.

361
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,887
Speaker 0: oh yeah hi everybody my name is Conrad Kraling.

362
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:30,713
Speaker 1: Conrad you have been here before but I wonder how many people listening know who you are.

363
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:31,377
Speaker 2: it's been a while.

364
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,305
Speaker 1: maybe you should intro duct yourself.

365
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:34,769
Speaker 1: yeah save me the trouble.

366
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:38,862
Speaker 0: so hey everybody I'm Conrad Kraling.

367
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,209
Speaker 0: I've been on the show a couple times.

368
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:48,247
Speaker 0: you might remember me from my last appearance on this show where I gave a rough estimate as to the number of times that I've masturbated in my entire life.

369
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,055
Speaker 0: oh yeah the number has gone up.

370
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:52,244
Speaker 0: just let me quell any doubts.

371
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:56,927
Speaker 2: well the question is not how not whether or not it went up but what the diff is like.

372
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:01,064
Speaker 1: get a measure that why are we drenching to this territory?

373
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:03,369
Speaker 1: yes also I don't remember that at all.

374
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:15,284
Speaker 0: I remember it vividly yes so currently I'm working as the founder and lead engineer at my little visual novel company date night.

375
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:18,055
Speaker 2: oh that's that's a big step up from just working.

376
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:19,883
Speaker 0: yeah yeah it's not bad.

377
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,221
Speaker 0: you mentioned you mentioned that you were going to be live at at PAX.

378
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:27,840
Speaker 0: one of our people is actually going to be there our product manager Joe foo.

379
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:34,667
Speaker 2: in fact actually because Joe is on the panel I realized this is like the first time ever I've put together a PAX panel.

380
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:36,675
Speaker 2: that isn't five to six white dudes.

381
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:40,789
Speaker 2: there are three ladies and three men on this panel.

382
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,395
Speaker 2: I'm kind of amazed.

383
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,788
Speaker 0: I I mean I'm obviously very happy at date night.

384
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:54,342
Speaker 0: oh the the idea that we can put work by creators of color and and women forward is like a big part of our mission statement.

385
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:56,291
Speaker 0: it's it's a big part of what we want to do.

386
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:59,685
Speaker 0: so thank you so much for helping us to make that happen.

387
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:02,678
Speaker 2: thing is for here like before date night.

388
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:10,423
Speaker 2: oh I pretty much submitted panels with your name on them to conventions for years without telling you yeah I'm really sorry that I had such difficulty getting out there.

389
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:16,682
Speaker 0: I'm really excited about this year though even even just being in the audience and you know having somebody from date night to be on stage it's gonna be dope.

390
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:17,164
Speaker 0: I'm excited.

391
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,734
Speaker 1: we'll see how many people show up.

392
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:23,734
Speaker 2: I don't know it's that's the kind of provocative title that the problem is.

393
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:29,752
Speaker 1: so I've never had a PAX panel with a bad turnout though every time I think it's gonna be a bad turnout I get at least like 50% fillage.

394
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:30,656
Speaker 1: I know what we weren't?

395
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:35,254
Speaker 2: we like early morning on Sunday at one point it's usually a good time.

396
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:38,550
Speaker 2: yeah the only bad time I think is during the Omega thon itself.

397
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,479
Speaker 1: well our Mondays is you know they gave this to us last year to our panel Monday at the very end of the con.

398
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,748
Speaker 1: we gotta run to the Omega thon.

399
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,962
Speaker 1: it's like uh but I don't even know if I want to run this year.

400
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:51,431
Speaker 2: we could do our joke that we do every year of admonishing the people in the audience for seeing us instead of the.

401
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:52,739
Speaker 1: oh that's definitely gonna happen.

402
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:54,268
Speaker 1: yeah that is definitely gonna happen.

403
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:55,959
Speaker 2: so Conrad how's this thing going?

404
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,517
Speaker 2: I mean you're making dating games and I guess some of them actually came out.

405
00:23:58,598 --> 00:23:59,764
Speaker 1: yeah do you make money doing that?

406
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:09,226
Speaker 0: yeah well uh you know obviously we ran the Star Fighter Eclipse Kickstarter which pulled in I believe a little over $150,000 a lot of money.

407
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:13,083
Speaker 1: yeah I mean it's not millions but that is way more monies than I have.

408
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:13,868
Speaker 0: yeah yeah it was.

409
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:17,350
Speaker 0: it was a rip-roaring start and you know we're still working on fulfillment for that game.

410
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,865
Speaker 0: in some ways we're doing the translations right now.

411
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,171
Speaker 0: we did.

412
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:24,733
Speaker 0: we did get the art book out as well as the soundtrack so we're really excited about that.

413
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:25,941
Speaker 0: the soundtrack is available on bank.

414
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,891
Speaker 1: how many languages are you translating the?

415
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:28,554
Speaker 0: so it's five.

416
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:34,683
Speaker 0: oh yeah it's five and and you know I actually just sent the contract out for our Russian translator.

417
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:39,043
Speaker 0: so yeah yeah yeah yeah it's actually a really big market for Starfighter.

418
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:46,495
Speaker 0: so yeah it was kind of a no-brainer for the for the project but yeah so that that actually shipped in May on date night.

419
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:51,116
Speaker 0: calm it's our first title on you know under our own power and on our own publishing platform.

420
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,409
Speaker 0: you just go to the website you play the game.

421
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,537
Speaker 0: there's like no downloads.

422
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,663
Speaker 0: you just buy it and play it it's.

423
00:24:55,824 --> 00:25:06,476
Speaker 0: uh it worked even better like you know obviously like it's my company and like I made the game but it worked even better than like I had imagined like it was so cool being able to just go there and do it.

424
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:11,962
Speaker 0: we actually have another game coming out in early to mid-september called we know the devil.

425
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:16,720
Speaker 0: this is a collaboration work with a VB of the other publication zeal.

426
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,550
Speaker 0: we obviously were really excited about.

427
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:20,858
Speaker 0: I just implemented the UI for that.

428
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,267
Speaker 0: today it looks it looks dope.

429
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:26,079
Speaker 0: that's in collaboration with Mia Schwartz.

430
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:29,277
Speaker 0: she's doing the artwork and like you know me as a buddy of mine anyway.

431
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,946
Speaker 0: so I couldn't be more excited about that.

432
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:38,718
Speaker 0: and then next year February we've got hustle cat our next our next title about magical boys and girls working in the cat cafe.

433
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:39,803
Speaker 1: who doesn't like that?

434
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:43,602
Speaker 1: I mean if that had a full boyfriend pigeon dating came out right.

435
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,312
Speaker 1: I mean that's like ten times better.

436
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:47,042
Speaker 0: I'm actually gonna leak something.

437
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,268

442
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,298
Speaker 0: I'm so excited.

443
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:05,430
Speaker 0: so these are definitely the most important.

444
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,266
Speaker 2: yeah right they've got to be real accurate or people are gonna be really mad.

445
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,177
Speaker 0: well they at least have to be real cute.

446
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:12,610
Speaker 0: that's really all I'm looking for is really accurate.

447
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,709
Speaker 0: but yeah we're actually in talks about doing a Kickstarter for that.

448
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,366
Speaker 0: we think we think we're gonna give crowdfunding a shot on that.

449
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:21,682
Speaker 1: so if the other one made 150 why wouldn't you do it again?

450
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:36,448
Speaker 0: yeah I will say that I think this is a an interesting new challenge for us because rather than being able to leverage an existing and let's face it really popular property like Hamlet machine starfighter we are kind of driving under our own power.

451
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:40,207
Speaker 0: now we kind of have to go in front of everybody and say this is an idea that we had.

452
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,075
Speaker 0: you know we can make games.

453
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:42,717
Speaker 0: we did it.

454
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,426
Speaker 0: you can go to the website and buy it.

455
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,713
Speaker 0: give us some money.

456
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,880
Speaker 0: we'll make another one of course.

457
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:56,929
Speaker 2: look how well that worked with like multiple Japanese game designers recent history who had a history of making good things and then just kind of struck out on their own for various reasons.

458
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,418
Speaker 0: yeah I couldn't imagine weird.

459
00:26:58,438 --> 00:26:59,965
Speaker 0: it's like a bunch of news came out recently.

460
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:01,873
Speaker 0: anyway.

461
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:10,872
Speaker 2: yeah I was gonna talk about the news the revelations about all the game designers and composers who are literally being janitors for a certain game company.

462
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:14,428
Speaker 1: but I mean you know visual novels are hot lately right?

463
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,620
Speaker 1: you know I mean having a property to go along with.

464
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,404
Speaker 1: it seems to help.

465
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:20,278
Speaker 1: but if you look on Steam it's like that long live.

466
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:22,008
Speaker 1: the Queen game seems to have done really well.

467
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:24,864
Speaker 1: I mean I bought that right and there was that in New Year's.

468
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,230
Speaker 1: yeah it's like.

469
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:34,845
Speaker 1: you know there's definitely a market for any kind of visual novel regard in the US regardless of you know what's in it well and I think there's.

470
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:38,323
Speaker 0: there's actually the opportunity there I believe is is bigger than we expect.

471
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:45,475
Speaker 0: because I do think that the presentation the mode of presentation is accessible in a way that a lot of games maybe aren't.

472
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:53,429
Speaker 0: so even with bio where's efforts in Mass Effect 3 to allow you to bypass the action sequences and just get to the story?

473
00:27:53,469 --> 00:28:01,568
Speaker 0: in the narrative you still had a lot of like let's face it relatively complicated controls for a certain set of users in a 3d space and in a 3d world.

474
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,739
Speaker 0: that was a barrier to entry to that narrative.

475
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,869
Speaker 0: and you know the price and the price?

476
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:07,471
Speaker 0: yeah you know.

477
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:12,832
Speaker 0: obviously like we don't have like GameStop we don't have EA we have.

478
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:16,211
Speaker 1: we have significantly lower overhead and the equipment that you need to play it right.

479
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:23,333
Speaker 1: you need either some kind of new ish console or a PC that doesn't suck yeah or a good PC and in our case like you can play your games on just like your phone right?

480
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,360
Speaker 0: yeah yeah it's it's all.

481
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,124
Speaker 0: it's all on the web.

482
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:26,169
Speaker 0: so it works with anything.

483
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,409
Speaker 0: above Andrew our Android 4.0 you've got iOS 8 and above.

484
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:34,651
Speaker 0: you know I actually have a Chromebook for testing and iPads probably really good to play it on.

485
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:35,618
Speaker 0: right it is actually.

486
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:36,502
Speaker 0: it looks beautiful.

487
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:40,493
Speaker 1: level resolution graphics?

488
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:49,748
Speaker 0: yeah oh yeah definitely we we actually bake two sets of assets for anything in the game one for high DPI displays and one for well yeah very nice.

489
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:57,411
Speaker 2: so it's interesting is that it these like the visual novels in general like they got really big but it seems like the ones that are getting the most traction.

490
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,262
Speaker 2: that people talk like hot tuba boyfriend is example.

491
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:07,939
Speaker 2: it's like the the ones that are almost a joke but like I played through that game it's not actually a great game it's just a great concept like.

492
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:12,777
Speaker 2: it's funny to know that it exists but it's not actually that fun to read it.

493
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:15,005
Speaker 0: so I have to admit something.

494
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:16,331
Speaker 0: I haven't played it yet.

495
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:19,102
Speaker 0: yeah so I will say I played it like a minute.

496
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:26,684
Speaker 0: it just came out on Vita which improves its odds like by about a thousand because the only time I ever get to play games now is when I'm a train or a bus or something.

497
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,870
Speaker 2: wait you have a Vita.

498
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,348
Speaker 0: yeah oh yeah I bought it to play danganronpa and persona for golden.

499
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,878
Speaker 0: so obviously like those are those are.

500
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:37,786
Speaker 0: they're a little more gamey.

501
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:41,520
Speaker 0: persona for definitely danganronpa pretty much.

502
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,350
Speaker 0: they're a little more gamey let's say.

503
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:47,631
Speaker 0: but at the same time they present this really strong narrative in a format that's really familiar to us.

504
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:58,955
Speaker 2: so hmm yeah well I remember like when I even like Emily and a lot of people I really want to play Mass Effect and all these games because the stories and then I really when I see them play Mass Effect 1 I'm just waiting for the.

505
00:29:59,035 --> 00:29:59,799
Speaker 2: oh this game sucks.

506
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,264
Speaker 0: Mass Effect 1 was bad.

507
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,909
Speaker 0: yeah I think ably bad.

508
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,594
Speaker 0: yeah well I beat it.

509
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:05,477
Speaker 0: so I could not.

510
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,144
Speaker 2: I could not.

511
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,793
Speaker 2: I did not care enough about that game.

512
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:12,049
Speaker 2: I just I realized I could just watch the story on YouTube and it's not even that long.

513
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:20,827
Speaker 0: yeah and and you know I think I don't think you're the only person to say that and so it's interesting because you're coming at this from and I will use this term here you're kind of a hardcore gamer.

514
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,347
Speaker 0: yeah you know you know what you're doing you know how to use game pretty good.

515
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:27,702
Speaker 0: so imagine coming at it from a completely different perspective.

516
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:34,836
Speaker 2: I guess what I don't like are games that have like a really hard game component like this thing and then completely orthogonal to that.

517
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:35,981
Speaker 2: here's the story.

518
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:42,169
Speaker 2: that will continue and if you care about one or the other then they don't really intersect at all.

519
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:47,874
Speaker 0: yeah and and personally I think one of the strengths of what we're doing is is that you we have shed a lot of that.

520
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:52,052
Speaker 0: that baggage I think is the way that I'll put it.

521
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:56,050
Speaker 0: I mean we all played Mass Effect 1. we all remember driving the Mako or the Mako.

522
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,441
Speaker 0: that was not a fun part of that game.

523
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:07,682
Speaker 2: dice rolls for aiming and shooting in a third-person title please please of course I remember I even have life one like the vehicles weren't great actually.

524
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:11,074
Speaker 1: Half-Life 1 yeah I don't know.

525
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:12,398
Speaker 1: jeepathon was good time.

526
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:13,522
Speaker 2: jeepathon was good times.

527
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,546
Speaker 2: it was not good.

528
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:17,538
Speaker 1: so you're so you're dating out against.

529
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:18,803
Speaker 1: they're mostly sort of just.

530
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:19,668
Speaker 1: you know the straight-up.

531
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:20,874
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure path.

532
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:24,173
Speaker 1: you know there's not a lot of you know game going on at all.

533
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:28,371
Speaker 1: but I mean do you think you can do if you wanted like the more you know?

534
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,520
Speaker 2: simulation added to staff builder.

535
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,538
Speaker 1: yeah like like Tokimeki like a Tokimeki right you got to go to school.

536
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:36,462
Speaker 1: do I study?

537
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,474
Speaker 2: I'm just gunning for another Tokimeki game.

538
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,142
Speaker 1: I can't read the ones that exist.

539
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:41,067
Speaker 1: I need something.

540
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,473
Speaker 0: yeah there's.

541
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:43,136
Speaker 0: you know the.

542
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,622
Speaker 0: the system itself is very flexible.

543
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:47,514
Speaker 0: there's nothing stopping us from doing that.

544
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:58,557
Speaker 0: personally like I have spent my time in stat builders man I said I spent my time in the stat mines and so personally I I'm not as excited about that game mode.

545
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:00,766
Speaker 0: technically though there's nothing stopping us.

546
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:10,915
Speaker 0: and you know who knows if if a creator came to me and said I have this really great game it's a stat builder here here's the pitch and it was awesome I'd be like yeah definitely like.

547
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:15,518
Speaker 0: get on board let's let's build it but it's it's not something that I'm I would.

548
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:16,563
Speaker 0: I'm like fired up about.

549
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:27,875
Speaker 2: I guess design and QA is a lot harder like a lot of those I've played but later most like a lot longer ago like not anytime recently like especially like Tokimeki's and things like those simple dating games.

550
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:30,910
Speaker 2: there's like it's just a threshold of.

551
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,900
Speaker 2: did you get to a threshold to trigger this thing?

552
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:37,233
Speaker 2: so a lot of your decisions don't actually matter.

553
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:40,466
Speaker 1: I noticed that more with like long live the Queen.

554
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:40,647
Speaker 1: right.

555
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:41,572
Speaker 1: that's literally like.

556
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,707
Speaker 1: did you get this stat up to this percent by this day?

557
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:45,873
Speaker 1: if so this happens.

558
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:46,858
Speaker 1: otherwise this happens.

559
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:50,575
Speaker 1: so it's really just to choose your own adventure where the choices are obscured.

560
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:58,432
Speaker 1: but Tokimeki like it was a PlayStation 1 game but I mean this might just be my SNES game I mean but it really blew up on the PlayStation.

561
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:06,184
Speaker 1: I remember the technology at least back then being so insane like it could read you know the text-to-speech of your name?

562
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,216
Speaker 2: oh yeah in a PlayStation 1 you type your name in.

563
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,671
Speaker 1: I remember our name was right and it's just like.

564
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:14,584
Speaker 1: it seemed like it wasn't doing what long live the Queen.

565
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,035
Speaker 1: it even though it might have been under the hood.

566
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,504
Speaker 1: it seemed a lot more natural.

567
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:20,014
Speaker 1: you know in terms of like I went to school.

568
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:28,638
Speaker 1: you know it's like oh if you went to school more often then you would get better grades and you know the girl who cared about school would be more likely to go out with you.

569
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:36,092
Speaker 1: and as opposed to these things you know there were things that happen on specific days but there were so many days in the school year.

570
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:41,423
Speaker 1: you know as I think you know other games like think of it what long of the Queen's like 40 days long or something like that.

571
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:42,449
Speaker 1: 50 days and that's it.

572
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:46,710
Speaker 1: you know Tokimeki is three years of Japanese high school yeah plus summer.

573
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,085
Speaker 0: if I remember though there was a random component to that game.

574
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:53,102
Speaker 0: you could choose to study but you maybe it wasn't a success.

575
00:33:53,143 --> 00:34:04,679
Speaker 1: I remember very whenever you chose one of the things it would be like you know like you would show the drawing and then like a circle or X like you succeeded or failed and being at the will of a random number generator.

576
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:10,291
Speaker 0: man there's nothing that's gonna turn me off from a game more quickly but it's a holding my breath like oh did he study right?

577
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,417
Speaker 0: this time you didn't.

578
00:34:11,478 --> 00:34:12,281
Speaker 0: you did it bad.

579
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:26,636
Speaker 2: but imagine the counterpoint of not the door fortress of if the more emergent the gameplay is like if if the randomness causes unintended or unexpected or at least unexpected to the player things to happen.

580
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:27,781
Speaker 2: then there's this.

581
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,431
Speaker 2: it adds like this additional layer of discovery.

582
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,225
Speaker 2: it's more like an evolving story then.

583
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,875
Speaker 2: well I followed this path to the end.

584
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:38,418
Speaker 2: I'm gonna try to follow this other very specific path and see I'll totally get on board with that.

585
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:44,685
Speaker 0: but I think at least my experience when I played Toki memo on the SNES it was come on green hair girl come on.

586
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:48,742
Speaker 2: no I did track so bad that she doesn't like me anymore.

587
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,411
Speaker 0: how about you other green hair girl?

588
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,763
Speaker 0: you're in the library you want to go to the park.

589
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:53,467
Speaker 0: she didn't?

590
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:54,735
Speaker 0: she did not want to go to the park.

591
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:57,288
Speaker 1: better restart the game better restart.

592
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:58,393
Speaker 0: so when?

593
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:01,025
Speaker 0: when you talk about like emergent behavior like that I love that.

594
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,260
Speaker 0: but the failure state for me and Toki memo was kind of like.

595
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,247
Speaker 0: well I'm sitting alone.

596
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,248
Speaker 2: well I've been thinking about this a lot partly cuz that far future games pan like.

597
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:12,959
Speaker 2: I found the slides from when I did a similar thing at magfest and also we had all those panels up to our fortress.

598
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,462
Speaker 2: and there's like.

599
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:25,132
Speaker 2: there's this critical mass like this threshold where there's enough emergent behavior and bushiness to where it feels like discovery and the randomness feels like the effectively infinite content.

600
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:32,904
Speaker 2: but anything less than that feels like the game just fucked you and anything more than that feels like actual dwarf fortress.

601
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:34,852
Speaker 0: you can lean into it too.

602
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:42,822
Speaker 0: so Joe actually her one of her first games was a game jam game for a Valentine's Day and it was essentially you were.

603
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:50,417
Speaker 0: you paired up with with literally random women at a bar who had literally random backstories and said literally random things.

604
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:56,156
Speaker 0: when you broke up and some of the some of the dialogue we got out of that was heartbreaking.

605
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,963
Speaker 1: so how did so?

606
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:58,647
Speaker 1: did you wait?

607
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,241
Speaker 1: it was literally like you didn't fill a database with text.

608
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:05,622
Speaker 0: well we randomly choose yeah we filled the database with database with text.

609
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:08,920
Speaker 2: I guess she's not saying like I can pick fuck question exclamation point.

610
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:10,770
Speaker 0: no no but it would it would.

611
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,051
Speaker 0: you know?

612
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:12,882
Speaker 0: you would end up being paired with a woman.

613
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:18,915
Speaker 0: you would meet a woman at a bar who turned out to be like a puff of smoke and then the breakup line was she's gone like the wind.

614
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,705
Speaker 0: it's just like that was random but at the same time.

615
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:26,099
Speaker 2: so I noticed this like a few months ago.

616
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:26,802
Speaker 2: but explodes.

617
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:28,109
Speaker 2: them actually sign on happiness.

618
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:29,477
Speaker 2: they have a random.

619
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:33,014
Speaker 2: like you know every webcomic has a random comic right like click for a random one.

620
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:37,490
Speaker 2: theirs actually generates a random comic three panels.

621
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,038
Speaker 2: it is almost nothing but comedy gold.

622
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:40,921
Speaker 0: does it?

623
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,147
Speaker 0: does it do that from transcripts?

624
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,854
Speaker 2: well basically he looks like he made like thousands of individual panels and he just picks three of them.

625
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:49,180
Speaker 0: oh all right.

626
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,532
Speaker 2: yeah I love that and it seeds it.

627
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:55,291
Speaker 2: so you can actually go find one that you found before if it was actually like particularly know where they.

628
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:58,934
Speaker 1: hmm yeah that does seem to be a thing about visual novels.

629
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:02,613
Speaker 1: is that you know if you have the randomness the failure state does suck.

630
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,525
Speaker 1: cuz it's like I spent a lot of time on this and got nowhere.

631
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,318
Speaker 1: but you lose like the replay value.

632
00:37:08,418 --> 00:37:11,397
Speaker 1: right like if I play a date night Oh game and I see every ending I'm sort of done.

633
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,972
Speaker 1: well if you read a book sure I guess that's the case.

634
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:16,980
Speaker 2: yes I was thinking about this a lot.

635
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,382
Speaker 2: they're like this.

636
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:23,213
Speaker 2: they're like this middle ground between just a book and like just a simulator like a door fortress.

637
00:37:23,414 --> 00:37:25,003
Speaker 1: you can't end you can always play it again.

638
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:27,093
Speaker 1: well it's kind of you can play one time.

639
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:29,768
Speaker 0: yeah I mean yes you're you're absolutely right you know.

640
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:37,605
Speaker 0: and in the same way that some games well I think attempt to provide value by banking on the RNG and giving you this emergent gameplay.

641
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:45,216
Speaker 0: our games bank on the fact that there's a lot of words and pretty pictures and you're gonna look at them all at least I hope you do so.

642
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:51,127
Speaker 0: you know the so the so there's that I man.

643
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:56,327
Speaker 2: well think about the RNG like a game like FTL faster than light leans on that like that's the game.

644
00:37:56,347 --> 00:38:00,825
Speaker 2: yeah and you get these like the end always sucks when you lose and usually you lose.

645
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:06,428
Speaker 2: but I definitely always because it's heavy on the gameplay the emergent stuff.

646
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,019
Speaker 2: it doesn't feel unsatisfying to die.

647
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,085
Speaker 2: but if you're playing a dating game and the emerge their RNG is just yeah no girls date you.

648
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:15,594
Speaker 2: that just feels really unsatisfying.

649
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:20,483
Speaker 2: it's not like there's a thousand different shadow gateways that you physically die because they didn't date you.

650
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:22,011
Speaker 2: then maybe it'd be interesting again.

651
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:25,420
Speaker 0: yeah wait I want to make this game like shadow shadow date.

652
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,990
Speaker 2: I would play the

653
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:30,252
Speaker 1: hell out of that

654
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:34,662
Speaker 0: smoking tinder torch

655
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:35,083
Speaker 1: torch.

656
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:36,727
Speaker 1: we go on girl.

657
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,370
Speaker 0: no no no don't do that.

658
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,452
Speaker 0: this race is coming on to you.

659
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:40,675
Speaker 0: wait hold up you're winning me over.

660
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:49,832
Speaker 2: so is that Zeno technically?

661
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:52,618
Speaker 2: or is that what is that ashy?

662
00:38:55,324 --> 00:39:07,635
Speaker 2: so what is it like on a like personal level having like for real founded a game studio because the one thing Scott I have never done is actually given up on our day jobs to go after the things we care about.

663
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:13,961
Speaker 1: like I say I'm so risk-averse like I still work for rich people I would totally do that.

664
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:17,156
Speaker 1: you know many ideas I have but I am very afraid of being homeless.

665
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:18,583
Speaker 1: so it's not a thing that I do.

666
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,372
Speaker 0: well it's it's interesting.

667
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:25,451
Speaker 0: so towards the end of my college career I went to a. I promise this is relevant.

668
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:26,113
Speaker 0: I went to.

669
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,276
Speaker 2: I went to a private school.

670
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:34,076
Speaker 0: my family's financial situation changed.

671
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:37,215
Speaker 0: I basically got kicked out because I didn't have enough money and to stay in school.

672
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,908
Speaker 0: I subsidize that by doing freelance web development.

673
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,741
Speaker 0: so I've been doing freelance web development.

674
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:47,212
Speaker 0: so I was like yeah like 21 or 22 and then after I graduated I had all these professional contacts from doing it.

675
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:50,453
Speaker 1: so I could you also like work at AMD and stuff because you were way smarter than me.

676
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,650
Speaker 0: well yeah I did an internship there and I did pretty okay.

677
00:39:53,851 --> 00:40:03,354
Speaker 0: but you know I once I graduated while a lot of people were getting these like w-2 yearly salaries I just kept doing freelance because I had all these professional contacts.

678
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:14,804
Speaker 0: so I got very used to this like invoice payment invoice payment cycle and feast and famine and it's sort of normalized risk for me in a way that I don't think it was normalized for a lot of people.

679
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:30,373
Speaker 0: so for me transitioning from my previous job which was like a normal w-2 salary position to date night oh which is you know it turns out owning a company and having a company is very different than being a freelancer because you don't get to invoice anybody.

680
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:39,563
Speaker 0: it is it is scary sometimes you know and and our co-founder Lindsay Woods of course is a full-time employee.

681
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:43,722
Speaker 0: so you know instead of you know just invoicing people I'm actually cutting paychecks.

682
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:51,071
Speaker 0: you're being invoiced yeah being actively invoiced and you know Joe Joe of course and Mike was on board.

683
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:57,050
Speaker 0: so these you know all of these things are happening and it's scary.

684
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,425
Speaker 0: but at the same time I think I'm well suited to it like to me.

685
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:16,221
Speaker 0: it's very exciting and and you guys have known me for a while you know that I've got that unfortunate personality situation where it's like I will invest like a hundred hours a week into something just because I didn't like the way this worked or because this needed to be just a little better before it launched.

686
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:23,892
Speaker 0: so the the confluence and the nexus of those two things I think were really really beneficial to me in that regard.

687
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,166
Speaker 0: it's been it's been nothing but a blast for me.

688
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,035
Speaker 2: so how about specifically doing it?

689
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:32,631
Speaker 2: is being in New York City a net positive or a net negative?

690
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,374
Speaker 2: in regard to this?

691
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:37,329
Speaker 0: this has been somewhat of a topic of discussion

692
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:37,630
Speaker 2: because

693
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:44,157
Speaker 1: I it's expensive but there's so much people's here and talents and monies but also costing monies

694
00:41:44,378 --> 00:42:01,057
Speaker 0: you hit the nail right on the head is the the nexus of talent that's present in the immediate vicinity the a 10-mile radius that I can bike to like like at the drop of a hat the fact that I could literally say to Hamlet Machine of Starfighter hey well I'm gonna come up there we're gonna work tonight I'll just crash with you.

695
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:02,485
Speaker 0: that's cool that's fine.

696
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:05,982
Speaker 0: it wasn't like a big deal it wasn't this this big investment of time?

697
00:42:06,243 --> 00:42:10,778
Speaker 0: when Lindsay Woods quit her job I was like hey just come work for me instead.

698
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:16,339
Speaker 2: like other than Joe everyone on that far future of gaming panel lives here.

699
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,248
Speaker 0: yeah yeah and you know we're.

700
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:21,081
Speaker 0: you know that that situation might be changing too.

701
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:24,837
Speaker 0: and so yeah this is the the nexus of talent present in New York.

702
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:29,697
Speaker 0: I. it's something I've been balancing very carefully recently.

703
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:38,672
Speaker 0: at this time I think it's fair to say that there is value in being in New York out stripping that of the kind of incredible cost of real estate.

704
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:40,075
Speaker 0: prices aren't going down here y'all.

705
00:42:40,196 --> 00:42:47,640
Speaker 2: we're in some of the few remaining rent stabilized buildings here.

706
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,494
Speaker 0: yeah I just spent the last three weeks in Northern Virginia.

707
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:53,023
Speaker 0: so yeah yeah and it was.

708
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:53,967
Speaker 0: it was gorgeous.

709
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:54,850
Speaker 0: like I won't play.

710
00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:00,577
Speaker 0: it was gorgeous but uh but at the moment I think it's it's safe to say that New York is is our home.

711
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:03,897
Speaker 0: this is where we were founded this is where our core is and it's it's where we're gonna be.

712
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,347
Speaker 2: cuz I ran into something interesting.

713
00:43:05,387 --> 00:43:08,044
Speaker 2: so I went to a the kind of party that I'm usually not invited to.

714
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:16,359
Speaker 2: so I was basically at an event with like all the VCS like the investors like the top of that food chain and they were doing presentations.

715
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:17,103
Speaker 2: there's all this stuff.

716
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:19,214
Speaker 1: and what one percent evil people.

717
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:22,529
Speaker 2: yeah some of them might be listening you never know.

718
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:34,026
Speaker 2: but well just say that I was in one of these events and what I learned is that they look at New York as a place to start a company because all the smart people are here but they want the company to move to California.

719
00:43:34,086 --> 00:43:40,012
Speaker 2: when they then want to pump it up get more investment and flip it wait it's obviously not for cost saving.

720
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,504
Speaker 2: it is actually in their perspective.

721
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:47,190
Speaker 2: they want to be out there because that's what they get more investment because salaries are lower.

722
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,258
Speaker 2: there's this they like.

723
00:43:48,298 --> 00:44:01,770
Speaker 2: we used to always say and Dean as we had this perception that the difference between an East Coast and a West Coast startup is that in the East Coast I'll work for a startup if they pay me money but on the West Coast people will work for basically dreams and lottery tickets.

724
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:10,858
Speaker 2: equity yeah and the talented people in New York are a lot more like business oriented in terms of let's make the thing.

725
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:16,021
Speaker 2: so it seems like those people are actually better at getting things working quickly.

726
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:25,506
Speaker 2: but when they want to expand the company they can pay a lot of people in lottery tickets and actually cost a lot less money to like triple your headcount on the West Coast.

727
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:29,105
Speaker 2: because a lot of those people are kind of semi independently wealthy.

728
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:32,183
Speaker 2: they have money from the last company that was a lottery ticket.

729
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:32,666
Speaker 2: there there's.

730
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,791
Speaker 2: it was just a weird conversation to be having with all these really really really rich people.

731
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:39,541
Speaker 1: if they're so rich why aren't they on the beach?

732
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:46,133
Speaker 2: yeah as soon as I have enough money to be on the beach I'm either on the beach or making my own game studio.

733
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:51,015
Speaker 0: yeah hey if they're looking for investment opportunities man do I have some good news for them?

734
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:57,496
Speaker 0: that does surprise me I won't lie although I guess I shouldn't be that surprised.

735
00:44:57,597 --> 00:45:00,775
Speaker 0: I've been kind of putting the feelers out for engineers out here.

736
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:03,046
Speaker 0: engineers out here are relatively hard to hire.

737
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:04,835
Speaker 0: that is has been my experience.

738
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:13,852
Speaker 2: oh everything's hard to hire like I. recruiters talk to me like direct and I basically tell him I work four days a week and you have to pay me a lot of money.

739
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:14,354
Speaker 1: how's that sound?

740
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:15,980
Speaker 0: yeah see welcome to New York.

741
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,075
Speaker 0: yeah but that's that's fair.

742
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:20,477
Speaker 0: I don't.

743
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:25,080
Speaker 0: I don't know where what our future holds in that regard at the moment but well there is.

744
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:25,945
Speaker 2: Emily told me about it.

745
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:40,204
Speaker 2: apparently there is a move for New York City might be the state - I'm not sure I could ask Emily about it but there might be a big like tax credit thing coming just for small semi-independent video game studios in New York.

746
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:41,028
Speaker 1: yeah but how about that?

747
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,804
Speaker 1: that startup NYC thing was bullshit so why would this not be?

748
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:47,222
Speaker 0: it was super bullshit by the way definitely bullshit right.

749
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,669
Speaker 1: so why wouldn't this also be bullshit?

750
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,399
Speaker 1: you never know you never know.

751
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,566
Speaker 2: I didn't write Emily told me about.

752
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:53,434
Speaker 2: I have not yet done any investigation into it.

753
00:45:53,454 --> 00:46:00,964
Speaker 0: hmm yeah given given Albany oh man I'm from upstate New York so like let me get super mad right now.

754
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:05,407
Speaker 0: but yeah when it comes to Albany in New York State tax code it's just like all bets are off.

755
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:06,453
Speaker 0: that shit is out the window.

756
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,020
Speaker 2: the worst thing is our bar best.

757
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:13,249
Speaker 2: our last best hope for peace was Zephyr Teachout and now she's running that super PAC instead.

758
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,576
Speaker 2: I don't think she's gonna run for governor again.

759
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:15,521
Speaker 1: I don't think so anything.

760
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,033
Speaker 0: oh well well that will do.

761
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,963
Speaker 0: that will make me leave New York.

762
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:23,030
Speaker 1: let's talk about other games.

763
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,576
Speaker 2: yeah what have you been playing lately?

764
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:27,408
Speaker 2: anything well you played anything.

765
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:30,901
Speaker 0: I well I did just beat danganronpa one and two all right.

766
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,472
Speaker 0: so I mentioned this right have you got?

767
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:34,782
Speaker 0: are you guys familiar with this game at all?

768
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:37,398
Speaker 1: it's a title that I've heard of but I've never played it.

769
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,735
Speaker 2: yeah that that whole like the same thing with persona like those are games that I know about primarily from let's play is making fun of them.

770
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:46,071
Speaker 1: I know the names of them and I know sort of what they look like.

771
00:46:46,612 --> 00:46:52,551
Speaker 0: I hate to be that that pitch guy who says oh it's like uber meets fresh direct.

772
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:57,243
Speaker 0: it is kind of like battle royale meets Phoenix Wright.

773
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:01,579
Speaker 0: so it's a Phoenix Wright high school murder simulator.

774
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:06,422
Speaker 0: with this most importantly it's got this incredibly bold visual style that how does it play?

775
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:09,173
Speaker 1: does it play like like like a 999?

776
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:14,857
Speaker 0: it actually plays more like a Phoenix right the yeah the the parallels actually go pretty deep.

777
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:20,124
Speaker 0: so there are murders and there are investigations and there are trials and the.

778
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,741
Speaker 0: there are actually more gamified elements in the trials than a Phoenix Wright.

779
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:26,414
Speaker 0: the first game I thought was significantly tighter.

780
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:29,530
Speaker 1: in this regard I have to do like a rhythm based objection.

781
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:32,697
Speaker 0: you are 100% correct.

782
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:35,242
Speaker 0: yes you do.

783
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:36,866
Speaker 0: that is that is absolutely correct.

784
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:46,103
Speaker 0: and and the you know my favorite of the mini games is the one where you have to drag comic panels into an incomplete comic to create the murder.

785
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:48,553
Speaker 1: that's actually pretty interesting.

786
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:51,049
Speaker 0: yeah yeah I thought the first game did a way better job like.

787
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:54,170
Speaker 1: it makes it still makes sense and you put it in the other orders but it's wrong.

788
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:55,337
Speaker 0: yeah yeah it'll.

789
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:58,514
Speaker 0: well it might not make sense so you could just put the wrong tile in the wrong space.

790
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:02,413
Speaker 1: yeah but you know it's not trivially easy if you're not cheating.

791
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:04,609
Speaker 2: Wow resurrection knife this isn't even a.

792
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,384
Speaker 0: but you know I really I love this style.

793
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:16,071
Speaker 0: the story of the first game really got me.

794
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,022
Speaker 0: I'm still like chewing through the second one.

795
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:21,398
Speaker 0: I will say that a lot of people I know really loved it.

796
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:22,523
Speaker 0: I'm still working on it.

797
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:26,122
Speaker 0: well you know I finished it but like I'm still kind of integrating it.

798
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:27,731
Speaker 0: so we'll see how I end up on that one.

799
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:29,697
Speaker 2: is that it?

800
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:30,600
Speaker 2: that's you that's your games.

801
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:32,606
Speaker 0: yeah I beat persona.

802
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:38,188
Speaker 0: I dabbled in Final Fantasy 14 briefly because there's an online one.

803
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:43,411
Speaker 0: yeah yeah there was this kind of like resurgence and I had this hot cat boy named cat face.

804
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:45,442
Speaker 0: yammer I mean yeah right like.

805
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:49,320
Speaker 0: come on I had the opportunity to be a hot cat boy so that that was.

806
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,099
Speaker 0: that was there for a bit but I I don't think I have the time right now to do MMOs.

807
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,344
Speaker 0: it turns out big surprise.

808
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:59,066
Speaker 2: yeah I think is I have almost invented free time and I would have time for MMOs.

809
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,276
Speaker 2: like I learned my lesson with the realm in 1997. man I played.

810
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:12,986
Speaker 1: I played more World of Warcraft than I probably should have back in college I'll say thankful to the muds of the 90s for protecting me from the 3d muds of the 2000s.

811
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:14,556
Speaker 2: now you didn't get your immunization.

812
00:49:14,596 --> 00:49:15,301
Speaker 2: that's your problem.

813
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:16,408
Speaker 0: yeah that's true that's right.

814
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:17,354
Speaker 2: I saw World of Warcraft.

815
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,645
Speaker 2: I'm like ah I've been there.

816
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,553
Speaker 0: done that you guys are a little older than me right?

817
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,320
Speaker 1: no I saw a picture of you the other day.

818
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:31,058
Speaker 2: I was cleaning up my like photos and I have a picture of you from back in the air like an RIT like standing in the front of the anime club.

819
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,865
Speaker 2: you look like you're like six.

820
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,459
Speaker 1: is he wearing an orange safety cone?

821
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,002
Speaker 1: you were.

822
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,129
Speaker 2: yeah that was the orange safety code.

823
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,517
Speaker 1: I was wearing a Naruto costume.

824
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:39,582
Speaker 2: yep that was.

825
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:40,266
Speaker 2: that was that day.

826
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:43,323
Speaker 0: still one of my proudest stage moments man thank you.

827
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:44,952
Speaker 0: thank you for bringing that apparently alrighty.

828
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:49,478
Speaker 1: anime is still going strong too like I read yeah we saw those people at kinetic on and also anime Boston.

829
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:54,704
Speaker 1: so whoa hey well not not the old people from back in the day like the current RIT anime club came.

830
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:58,438
Speaker 2: there's a little like there's weird like genetic memory of us.

831
00:50:00,343 --> 00:50:01,627
Speaker 0: that's that's amazing man.

832
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:03,837
Speaker 0: so you guys asked me what games I'm playing.

833
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:04,540
Speaker 0: I gave you.

834
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:05,606
Speaker 0: I gave you the good answer.

835
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,296
Speaker 0: now I have to give you the bad answer.

836
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,447
Speaker 0: oh alright so this one's a two-parter.

837
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:10,553
Speaker 0: okay I'm really sorry.

838
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,785
Speaker 0: fruits of gracias came out on steam.

839
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:14,789
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

840
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,299
Speaker 0: oh man Scott I have good news for you.

841
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:24,276
Speaker 0: it is a half a million word visual novel that was initially a.

842
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:27,809
Speaker 1: I guess I don't have to worry about the replay value.

843
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:33,851
Speaker 2: I tell fruits and it recommended that immediately before I typed of what's it about.

844
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:45,936
Speaker 0: so you play as the worst person in the world who rolls into this town and is obviously connected somehow with like the Japanese military and you're immediately arrested.

845
00:50:46,057 --> 00:50:49,214
Speaker 0: and then you are sent to this school where there are only four other.

846
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:53,392
Speaker 0: you have four classmates all of whom are romance options and a principal.

847
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,183
Speaker 2: wait there's five girls on the corny or not?

848
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:57,347
Speaker 0: oh it's super.

849
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:58,573
Speaker 0: well not the steam version.

850
00:50:58,654 --> 00:50:59,277
Speaker 0: oh is it five?

851
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:00,122
Speaker 0: did I get the number wrong?

852
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,726
Speaker 0: it is five.

853
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:05,791
Speaker 2: I say yeah this is an adult visual novel it is super adult but it has that many words in it.

854
00:51:06,153 --> 00:51:07,640
Speaker 0: yeah yeah well it is.

855
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,766
Speaker 0: I mean I don't know.

856
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:09,991
Speaker 0: are you familiar with love love?

857
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:12,782
Speaker 2: no wait this many words.

858
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,689
Speaker 2: listen I feel like this is gonna be so.

859
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,304
Speaker 1: apparently you've done a. being a creator of visual novels.

860
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,623
Speaker 1: you seem to have done a lot of research on what is available out there.

861
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:28,671
Speaker 0: let me give it just an actual shout out right now to the writer of hustle cad Casey Van Hise for digging in to mov love.

862
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:32,387
Speaker 0: she got further in that game that I thought humanly possible.

863
00:51:32,648 --> 00:51:43,279
Speaker 0: but if you like this the creator of attack on Titan actually went out of his way to say like hey I really I really loved mov love like it was a lot of that in that scenario that I really enjoyed.

864
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:51,446
Speaker 1: if you were not playing that and learning to draw better that would be because of it works for the body horror thing.

865
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:55,341
Speaker 2: but so my character design is some body horror here.

866
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:57,854
Speaker 0: oh man the mov love character designs are rough.

867
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:02,354
Speaker 2: let me tell you that reminds me of old savor marionette Jay crossed with like.

868
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:04,282
Speaker 2: I don't know MK are.

869
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:11,505
Speaker 1: I do always like the hairs that come forward like where there should be sideburns but they're long because she looks like that Tokimeki girl the one that you always know.

870
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:12,230
Speaker 1: I always like that.

871
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:23,248
Speaker 0: so so this game starts off as a normal high school romance simulator and it's a normal visual novel and there's two romance or five or four romance translated these things no one with hundreds of thousands of words.

872
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:24,877
Speaker 0: this is the one with hundreds of thousands of words.

873
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:28,396
Speaker 0: also this one also has it and this was a fan translation.

874
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:42,533
Speaker 0: so you you play this normal high school romance and then you beat it with these two romance options and then the game restarts into this ruined world where you're a mech pilot and all the women have to wear suits to show their boobies off and by that I mean there's glass panes on their boobies.

875
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,584
Speaker 1: well I didn't have the booby part.

876
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:47,359
Speaker 1: I definitely want to play the game where the world is ruined and you're a mech pilot.

877
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,996
Speaker 0: okay well so yeah no me too for what it's worth.

878
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:51,508
Speaker 0: we were like okay we just have to get through.

879
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:52,211
Speaker 0: it's called movlev.

880
00:52:52,292 --> 00:53:05,478
Speaker 0: extra is the opening sequence and the movlev alternative the back half ruined world part and we were actually kind of excited about this because we were all reading attack on Titan at the time and Hajime Isayama was like yeah you know this was kind of an.

881
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:08,618
Speaker 0: I don't know if he said inspiration but he definitely mentioned the ruined world.

882
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,745
Speaker 0: okay yeah yeah.

883
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,297
Speaker 0: and so we were like yeah okay and then we started playing.

884
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:16,412
Speaker 0: it is like oh actually part of what Hajime Isayama?

885
00:53:16,532 --> 00:53:17,014
Speaker 0: Is that his name?

886
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:17,998
Speaker 0: I might be screwing his name up.

887
00:53:18,018 --> 00:53:18,259
Speaker 1: I'm so sorry.

888
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:35,353
Speaker 0: so part of what I think he took away from this was the intense jingoism and and like remilitarization of Japan and like you got it got mega uncomfortable in there for a second because this actually we were playing this right about the time when Mr.

889
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:38,205
Speaker 0: Isayama took all that heat for saying that stuff about Korea.

890
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:48,116
Speaker 1: yeah yeah so I mean aren't the otaku's who play these things in Japan usually also military fanboys?

891
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:48,739
Speaker 1: so isn't it?

892
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,349
Speaker 1: just like you know that's the audience.

893
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:53,257
Speaker 0: I mean there is a show now where young girls turn into battleships.

894
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:54,580
Speaker 0: so it's not.

895
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,571
Speaker 0: no I didn't.

896
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:01,949
Speaker 1: you see the airplane one - no yeah there's plenty of these things.

897
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:03,800
Speaker 0: I wanted to believe this was a new phenomenon.

898
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,360
Speaker 1: I mean I guess it's new relative to the history of the universe.

899
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,969
Speaker 2: I don't know what the first one was.

900
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:09,894
Speaker 1: that's a good quote.

901
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,497
Speaker 1: katsu would know.

902
00:54:10,617 --> 00:54:11,723
Speaker 2: katsu would know.

903
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,029
Speaker 0: so this is mov love.

904
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,430
Speaker 0: and then the game I'm playing is fruits of Grisaia which smells weirdly like it.

905
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:17,534
Speaker 0: it's been.

906
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:18,678
Speaker 0: it's been rough guys.

907
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,775
Speaker 0: I okay more more geek nights exclusive some some deep insider tips.

908
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:33,532
Speaker 0: I run a Twitter by the handle fuck game tweets and I started taking screenshots of this game and putting them next to the steam review quotes.

909
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:39,088
Speaker 2: so my uh my one small anecdote is way back.

910
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:41,537
Speaker 2: I was with a bunch of like business contact people in.

911
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:48,268
Speaker 2: I was in Singapore at the time at a party on the roof of a fancy hotel and we're hanging out and people talking.

912
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:49,961
Speaker 2: no one gives a shit about the finance stuff.

913
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:55,354
Speaker 2: they're all asking about the video game stuff like oh my god you go to PAX like ah and we start talking about a pecs - look how much money you have.

914
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:59,336
Speaker 2: yeah go well but I was like you lecture packs get me a job in the game industry.

915
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:01,145
Speaker 2: I hate Wall Street like that's.

916
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:10,507
Speaker 2: you have so much money like making visual novels and there's a beat where I always pause because I expect these people to be like what's a visual novel.

917
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:12,457
Speaker 2: and I'm like already know what I'm gonna say.

918
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,538
Speaker 2: and the guy I'm talking to without skipping a beat doesn't say what's a visual novel.

919
00:55:16,558 --> 00:55:18,550
Speaker 2: he says oh those Asian fuck games cool.

920
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:22,181
Speaker 0: and he was right about our first title.

921
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:25,313
Speaker 0: those boys in space are definitely just cramming.

922
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:43,043
Speaker 2: you know I like Starfighter but also I'm not just gonna say that relationship is not a hundred percent healthy like there's a little bit every every sexual encounter in Starfighter Eclipse is overtly consensual and we actually made sure of this in a copy editing pass.

923
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:44,874
Speaker 0: this was part of our copy editing process.

924
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:50,282
Speaker 0: yeah it was to make sure that every sexual encounter was explicitly consensual and I was just saying that.

925
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:51,549
Speaker 1: I'm guessing that's.

926
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:52,754
Speaker 1: are you saying that it's not the case?

927
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:53,456
Speaker 1: in love?

928
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,427
Speaker 0: I didn't play enough love love in.

929
00:55:56,648 --> 00:56:03,772
Speaker 0: in there is at least a character that would definitely get you put into big-boy jail romancing.

930
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:06,451
Speaker 1: I mean I wasn't gonna play this but now I'm double not gonna play this.

931
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,020
Speaker 0: yeah no I had that problem.

932
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,458
Speaker 0: I played this overdrive game called the Edelweiss and I basically beat this game.

933
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:16,523
Speaker 0: I got all the roots except for the character who looked super young and I was like I can't finish this game.

934
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,233
Speaker 0: sorry bye that was the game.

935
00:56:18,394 --> 00:56:21,473
Speaker 0: that was actually the game that I broke by trying to go the platonic route.

936
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:26,412
Speaker 0: oh yeah I didn't accept anybody's advances and then the game crashed.

937
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,619
Speaker 0: it just straight-up crashed and I reproduced the bug.

938
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:36,984
Speaker 2: you know if you open that bug ticket like they wouldn't understand.

939
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:40,018
Speaker 0: I don't know if that that might have been by their previous company groover.

940
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,308
Speaker 0: so hi what's up?

941
00:56:42,368 --> 00:56:44,259
Speaker 0: I'm a font of visual novel knowledge.

942
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:44,783
Speaker 0: come at me.

943
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,821
Speaker 0: anyway I've been playing this game which has been really really sad.

944
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:55,679
Speaker 1: this you know though I can't fault you because one is legit research and two I mean if my job was to make these things I'd have to suffer through them.

945
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,632
Speaker 0: it raised a half a million dollars on Kickstarter.

946
00:56:57,812 --> 00:57:06,427
Speaker 2: whoa yeah well uh we've played a lot of kick-started board games and all I will say is that sometimes I'll get an email.

947
00:57:06,447 --> 00:57:11,729
Speaker 2: in fact recently we got an email from a pretty big name game developer who didn't like that.

948
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:13,359
Speaker 2: we'd played his game and talked about it.

949
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:16,056
Speaker 2: the way that we talked about it because we were kind of down on it.

950
00:57:16,578 --> 00:57:17,885
Speaker 2: we played a lot of bad games.

951
00:57:17,926 --> 00:57:18,710
Speaker 0: yeah what are they gonna do?

952
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:24,638
Speaker 0: like come to your house and be like hey stop talking about our game like yeah do that maybe make a better game next time.

953
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:30,278
Speaker 2: but lately the thing I've been watching a lot on YouTube is red suprays.

954
00:57:31,483 --> 00:57:32,466
Speaker 2: you know about red supray?

955
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,079
Speaker 0: I mean it sounds like you're saying let's play but wrong.

956
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:44,313
Speaker 2: so what they do is they watch other people's let's plays and they just make fun of them and this concept sounds really mean-spirited.

957
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:44,815
Speaker 2: it kind of is.

958
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,880
Speaker 0: it sounds like it?

959
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:56,260
Speaker 2: yeah and yeah I learned a lot about what it means to be human watching those things the the best one ever is just titled Mario party of one.

960
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,657
Speaker 1: all right where they watch the guy play Mario party by himself.

961
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:01,884
Speaker 2: what are you doing in there Johnny?

962
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,999
Speaker 2: nothing just me and my four friends or my three friends.

963
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:06,505
Speaker 1: calm calm and calm.

964
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,334
Speaker 1: we're just having a having a big ol Mario party.

965
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:16,478
Speaker 2: and the worst part is the kid loses to the AI like kind of often you got too many stars.

966
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:26,383
Speaker 2: at one point princess peach like runs way past him with a mushroom and then he just like ah she's running away from me just like all the girls do and then he just gets quiet for like a minute.

967
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:29,514
Speaker 0: this guy's got to work on his radio voice.

968
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:30,156
Speaker 0: yeah no kidding.

969
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:35,313
Speaker 0: why does everybody around me keep dying?

970
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,058
Speaker 0: I hate this game.

971
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,584
Speaker 0: I don't want to remilitarize Japan.

972
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:43,039
Speaker 1: yeah so I'm military Japan to kill the people who made Mario Party.

973
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:47,677
Speaker 0: so I've been playing Grisaia which has been a slog.

974
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:49,425
Speaker 0: but guys I fell into the trap.

975
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:53,860
Speaker 0: I've been playing love live.

976
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,863
Speaker 0: I've been playing it.

977
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:57,614
Speaker 0: I've been playing it a lot it's it's been troublesome.

978
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:02,278
Speaker 2: you know at least you're not stagnating because I still only pretty much play like counter-strikes at five.

979
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:12,632
Speaker 1: I'm playing hearthstone and netrunner and I just started playing a cookie clicker variant call hi it was on steam yesterday.

980
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:13,695
Speaker 2: yeah it's a good reason.

981
00:59:13,815 --> 00:59:16,061
Speaker 0: I saw people were all these people in my.

982
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:22,532
Speaker 1: it kept saying that like people were playing this game you know and my steam friends.

983
00:59:22,954 --> 00:59:24,985
Speaker 1: and it was called like capitalist something.

984
00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:26,473
Speaker 1: and I'm like what the hell is that?

985
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:32,281
Speaker 1: and I see it's free to play so I could play and it's just a cookie clicker candy box but it's really slick.

986
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:35,916
Speaker 1: so I'm like oh okay and it runs while like it's closed.

987
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:37,824
Speaker 1: it's refined heroin.

988
00:59:37,964 --> 00:59:42,144
Speaker 0: yeah exactly so I'm just like oh what if I mean that is that is for what it's worth.

989
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:44,716
Speaker 0: refined heroin is how I would describe my time with a love life.

990
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,588
Speaker 0: they limit you have like it's.

991
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:50,445
Speaker 0: it's that classic concept that gets me every goddamn time.

992
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,914
Speaker 0: they give you a fixed amount of energy.

993
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,342
Speaker 0: they say you want to play a hard song.

994
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,533
Speaker 0: you got to provide 15 love points.

995
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:59,327
Speaker 0: yeah I only have 40. but man I'm so close to my next level.

996
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,431
Speaker 0: I paid a dollar.

997
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:05,306
Speaker 2: okay I'd say you didn't go past so far.

998
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:09,141
Speaker 1: I bought both hearthstone adventure expansions which cost a lot more than a dollar.

999
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:12,957
Speaker 0: I needed one love gem to collect my 11 rare card.

1000
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,807
Speaker 0: I was like I'm not gonna wait.

1001
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:17,977
Speaker 0: I could have I could guys I could have waited three hours.

1002
01:00:17,997 --> 01:00:24,871
Speaker 1: I mean it's it's surprising like how I've been hooked on so many of those over time but I've managed to just drop all of them.

1003
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:33,955
Speaker 1: and like I played the one where you grow the molar fish oh I played that for like weeks and then one day I just lead it from my phone and then it was deleted from my memory.

1004
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:38,362
Speaker 1: like I just didn't have any instinct to go and open it up or any memory of it or any care.

1005
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:40,432
Speaker 0: that's exactly what happened to be at fallout shelter.

1006
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:42,359
Speaker 1: exactly same thing with fallout shelter.

1007
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:48,703
Speaker 1: and same thing with dragon coins which is the coin pushing machine.

1008
01:00:48,763 --> 01:00:52,418
Speaker 1: where then you also have they also fight like an RPG style.

1009
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,421
Speaker 1: it's weird.

1010
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:55,387
Speaker 2: yeah that game.

1011
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:57,480
Speaker 2: well you show me that game and all I could saw the whole time.

1012
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:58,932
Speaker 2: all I asked you was why are you playing this?

1013
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:03,177
Speaker 2: I and then I just needed it and then I know the state fair and put quarters in that machine.

1014
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:04,243
Speaker 2: it's the same thing.

1015
01:01:04,303 --> 01:01:06,394
Speaker 1: at least one of the state fair gives you money.

1016
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:10,553
Speaker 1: this one tries to take your money and it gives you fake money in replacement.

1017
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,046
Speaker 2: yeah so so more importantly are you?

1018
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:16,414
Speaker 2: uh are you caught up on any animes?

1019
01:01:16,534 --> 01:01:17,016
Speaker 2: are you watching?

1020
01:01:17,036 --> 01:01:18,540
Speaker 1: see my time animes on Tuesday.

1021
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:24,324
Speaker 0: okay so I mean me and Joe actually made sure to get nice and caught up.

1022
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:25,390
Speaker 0: that was that was nice.

1023
01:01:25,511 --> 01:01:27,061

Speaker 2: we reviewed it already.

1035
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:47,083

1040
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,883
Speaker 0: that's very good.

1041
01:01:53,903 --> 01:01:55,390
Speaker 1: what is the connection I have?

1042
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,593
Speaker 0: no I did not know.

Speaker 0: that's been great.

1047
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,680
Speaker 0: or a Monogatari is I think the sweetest yes ever been produced?

1048
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:10,652
Speaker 2: that show gets so many points for the third episode.

1049
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:13,142
Speaker 1: why don't you make the visual novel of that?

1050
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:14,548
Speaker 0: I would man.

1051
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:15,674

01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:16,883
Speaker 1: who cares?

1054
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:18,958
Speaker 1: if they try to stop you are they gonna do about it?

1055
01:02:18,978 --> 01:02:20,610
Speaker 0: see once you have a company these things become very.

1056
01:02:22,136 --> 01:02:24,364
Speaker 1: you just release that one on like BitTorrent no one knows.

1057
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:26,713
Speaker 2: no one knows it was you?

1058
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,501
Speaker 0: that's right and no one can pay.

1059
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:29,505
Speaker 0: and then we don't eat.

1060
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:31,513
Speaker 1: you can get donations you know.

1061
01:02:31,593 --> 01:02:33,861
Speaker 2: well you also make it a crypto Bitcoin.

1062
01:02:34,062 --> 01:02:37,979
Speaker 0: did I tell you guys I cashed out all my bitcoins for magic cards.

1063
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,366
Speaker 0: what that's real?

1064
01:02:39,607 --> 01:02:40,492
Speaker 1: why would you get magic?

1065
01:02:40,613 --> 01:02:42,302
Speaker 1: wait bitcoins are like a new thing.

1066
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,312
Speaker 1: that means you've played magic this recently.

1067
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:46,361
Speaker 1: yeah why are you playing magic?

1068
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:48,509
Speaker 2: wait did you buy them on Mount Gox?

1069
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:49,172
Speaker 0: I didn't.

1070
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:50,938
Speaker 0: okay legitimate question.

1071
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:53,226
Speaker 0: no I bought them on Abu games.

1072
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:53,627
Speaker 0: calm.

1073
01:02:54,009 --> 01:02:58,914
Speaker 0: the only retailer I could find basically it was during that massive crash that happened in like January.

1074
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:01,202
Speaker 2: I believe they were crashing.

1075
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:02,266
Speaker 0: yeah I I.

1076
01:03:02,707 --> 01:03:04,994
Speaker 1: so when did you get bitcoins?

1077
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,818
Speaker 0: uh late last year.

1078
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:09,405
Speaker 1: so recently yeah yeah by drugs.

1079
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:12,234
Speaker 1: but why would you buy Bitcoin?

1080
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:13,581
Speaker 0: I was legitimately just curious.

1081
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,371
Speaker 1: so I just like how big lines work.

1082
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,773
Speaker 0: there is a tale of woe here because I mined out to full goddamn bitcoins.

1083
01:03:19,813 --> 01:03:21,020
Speaker 0: you actually mind coins?

1084
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,810
Speaker 0: straight up mind about a fair use GPU.

1085
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,547
Speaker 2: yeah there was a time you could just mine coins that we consumer PC.

1086
01:03:25,628 --> 01:03:26,834
Speaker 0: oh there was a time you could do it.

1087
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:27,939
Speaker 0: I never even try you.

1088
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:29,445
Speaker 0: and then they're.

1089
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:37,082
Speaker 0: they're gone now I don't know where they live and some kind of wallet who knows yeah in a wallet that I don't have access to and is lost.

1090
01:03:37,122 --> 01:03:40,017
Speaker 0: the problem with Bitcoin yeah one of the things right like.

1091
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:42,992
Speaker 0: okay for real can we talk about the money supply of Bitcoin?

1092
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:47,369
Speaker 0: super fast does the money supply continue to shrink like that is?

1093
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,156
Speaker 0: dipshits like me lose their wallets?

1094
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:54,898
Speaker 2: uh well yes but because they're so divisible it probably doesn't matter.

1095
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:58,738
Speaker 2: I don't know like I don't think the inflation of them.

1096
01:03:58,778 --> 01:04:02,818
Speaker 2: I'm more worried about the integrity of the integrity of the Bitcoin chain over time.

1097
01:04:02,858 --> 01:04:04,325
Speaker 0: yeah okay thank you given.

1098
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:07,820
Speaker 0: given like high-profile investments by like the Winklevoss twin yeah like.

1099
01:04:07,961 --> 01:04:08,383
Speaker 2: yeah.

1100
01:04:08,564 --> 01:04:18,307
Speaker 2: if someone has a controlling interest in the blockchain and they already might yep then they own Bitcoin yeah which is honestly like I had a couple there.

1101
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,231
Speaker 0: I didn't have a couple.

1102
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,335
Speaker 0: I had a couple and lost them.

1103
01:04:20,576 --> 01:04:22,864
Speaker 0: I had some shreds Bitcoin dust.

1104
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:27,060
Speaker 0: I guess I turned him into magic cards and I'm done so.

1105
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:35,593
Speaker 2: I'm on the committee in the FPL to basically figure out how to normalize Bitcoin and blockchain transactions in financial protocols.

1106
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:41,640
Speaker 2: so like exchanges can like use them in stream how about you work on the confirmation time?

1107
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,022
Speaker 0: somehow?

1108
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,551
Speaker 0: how about you get in touch with mr.

1109
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:44,295
Speaker 0: Satoshi?

1110
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:47,410
Speaker 0: yeah see what he can do for you reducing that confirmation time.

1111
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,364
Speaker 0: because if yeah sorry hey what's up?

1112
01:04:50,404 --> 01:04:52,071
Speaker 0: never mind I'm not gonna turn this in a Bitcoin.

1113
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:57,947
Speaker 1: yes I guess we know it's not Conrad Satoshi cradling.

1114
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:00,634
Speaker 2: he's planting a red herring here right now.

1115
01:05:00,654 --> 01:05:02,999
Speaker 0: okay so I understand how payments work.

1116
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:07,923
Speaker 0: if I'm fucking piece of gum I can't wait 30 minutes to find out if I have the bitcoins for it.

1117
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:10,171
Speaker 0: I need to be able to pay and leave the CBS.

1118
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:17,298
Speaker 2: but you could do that to buy say illegal merchandise that's being shipped to you in a dead drop.

1119
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:20,473
Speaker 1: yeah wait this is still Tuesday gaming.

1120
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,820
Speaker 1: right you're just talking about magic cards.

1121
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,845
Speaker 1: why are you playing magic?

1122
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:23,026
Speaker 1: what?

1123
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:23,991
Speaker 1: what's going on there?

1124
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:25,880
Speaker 2: wait what magic is this?

1125
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,683
Speaker 1: 1995?

1126
01:05:26,683 --> 01:05:33,652
Speaker 2: wait with these individual magic cards over these boxes very individuals wait what cars did you buy?

1127
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:35,881
Speaker 1: much magic are you playing and what decks are you playing?

1128
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:44,403
Speaker 0: okay so I unfortunately you know this is during a time when when I was doing some freelance work I had disposable income but I also had some like time.

1129
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:45,307
Speaker 2: well you dispose of it?

1130
01:05:45,348 --> 01:05:45,709
Speaker 2: alright.

1131
01:05:46,634 --> 01:05:47,760
Speaker 0: well no I just supposed to bitcoins.

1132
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,167
Speaker 0: it was very convenient.

1133
01:05:50,428 --> 01:05:54,983
Speaker 0: so I you know we were playing and and I got I got some some cards.

1134
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:55,505
Speaker 0: I got them.

1135
01:05:56,108 --> 01:06:02,679
Speaker 0: I had a deck that was based around Zalgo zergo helm smasher namely because we were playing commander and I really like the suit.

1136
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:03,905
Speaker 0: I wanted to run a goblin deck.

1137
01:06:04,206 --> 01:06:04,809
Speaker 0: he was an ogre.

1138
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:10,370
Speaker 0: so I made this like like green and nasty except it was white red black.

1139
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:12,336
Speaker 2: yeah that's too many colors for commander.

1140
01:06:12,357 --> 01:06:14,768
Speaker 0: you actually want a three color spread.

1141
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:16,961
Speaker 0: three color spreads of commander are totally valid.

1142
01:06:17,323 --> 01:06:19,190
Speaker 1: okay Wow magic's changed a lot.

1143
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:28,306
Speaker 0: yeah yeah rather than just doing the standard format where you have like 20 life and you know I forget what the optimal deck size is we never play.

1144
01:06:28,326 --> 01:06:28,486
Speaker 0: stand.

1145
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:33,747
Speaker 2: back in my day in the old days 40 was the minimum.

1146
01:06:33,787 --> 01:06:36,317
Speaker 1: well yeah when I play back in the 90s it would in the.

1147
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:41,102
Speaker 1: in the instruction book it said 40 was the minimum but at the tournament 60 was the minute.

1148
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,775
Speaker 0: yeah correct right I believe you guys have the right of it.

1149
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:47,158
Speaker 0: and again I'm betraying the fact that I don't play standard I only play commander.

1150
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,361
Speaker 2: well we're betraying the fact that I stopped playing magic when fallen empires came out.

1151
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:53,695
Speaker 0: hey listen I'm not gonna throw stone like.

1152
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:59,092
Speaker 0: obviously I'm in a glass house right now just like you know.

1153
01:06:59,332 --> 01:06:59,613
Speaker 0: we got.

1154
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:03,004
Speaker 0: we got really into it again and but but my interest has waned.

1155
01:07:03,024 --> 01:07:06,296
Speaker 0: I think I love net runner.

1156
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:07,099
Speaker 0: don't don't get me wrong.

1157
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,341
Speaker 0: I had the privilege of playing with some some fine folks a couple months ago and it was.

1158
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:11,747
Speaker 0: it was a blast yeah.

1159
01:07:12,048 --> 01:07:12,972
Speaker 1: so why don't you play at all time?

1160
01:07:13,937 --> 01:07:16,383
Speaker 1: you got meetups on anymore.

1161
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:16,785
Speaker 0: I turned.

1162
01:07:16,805 --> 01:07:18,313
Speaker 0: I turned bitcoins into magic.

1163
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:24,649
Speaker 1: I turned magic money into magic cards and now I can't just turn the magic cards in an hour your cards and you'll be done or back into bitcoins.

1164
01:07:25,894 --> 01:07:28,684
Speaker 1: I guess that's that opens your options a lot wider - you can just turn me into drugs.

1165
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,992
Speaker 1: yeah drugs drugs for drugs.

1166
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:33,761
Speaker 2: wait is this?

1167
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:34,765
Speaker 0: oh I'm going to jail now.

1168
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:39,007
Speaker 1: nevermind I know Adderall's been a hot topic on this show and that's right.

1169
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:41,141
Speaker 0: no white person has ever gone to jail for taking Adderall.

1170
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:43,749
Speaker 2: no I saw the worst statistic.

1171
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:49,171
Speaker 2: it basically said that like marijuana is legal for white people in New York State.

1172
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,035
Speaker 1: yep pretty much.

1173
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:51,484
Speaker 2: by the way the arrests have broken down.

1174
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:52,592
Speaker 2: I believe you're white.

1175
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:54,061
Speaker 2: you could just have all the weed you want.

1176
01:07:54,502 --> 01:07:55,104
Speaker 0: is it targeted?

1177
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:55,666
Speaker 0: you can run.

1178
01:07:55,686 --> 01:08:03,134
