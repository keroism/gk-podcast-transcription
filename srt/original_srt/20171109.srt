1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,751
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, November 9th, 2017.

2
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:12,293
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:12,855
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:14,660
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:15,997
Speaker 1: Snacks.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,378
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,819
Speaker 1: So, uh, Scott paid me to go to the Rangers game with him last night.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,660
Speaker 0: I accidentally pushed the wrong button on the incredibly simple Google Wallet.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sitting at work and I get basically just I get this Google notification.

10
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:32,057
Speaker 1: It's like Scott sent you 130 bucks.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,138
Speaker 1: I'm like, huh, I'll bet Scott's hit send instead of take.

12
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:37,720
Speaker 0: That's right.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,658
Speaker 1: And I bet he's gonna message me and then immediately there's a message like oops.

14
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,806
Speaker 0: There's a message take twice as much as twice as much as was just given.

15
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:51,839
Speaker 1: But not to get too much into it because I know you nerds don't care but you should because sports are pretty great.

16
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:56,773
Speaker 1: The Rangers, the hockey team of whom we are fans.

17
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:59,000
Speaker 0: They started off the season El Garbajo.

18
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,471
Speaker 1: They're one of the original six and they have been a reliably good team.

19
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:05,480
Speaker 1: Not always a great team, but a contender for a while now.

20
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:07,644
Speaker 0: Last year they were good.

21
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:08,166
Speaker 0: Okay.

22
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:09,431
Speaker 1: They made it to the playoffs.

23
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:11,660
Speaker 1: It's already better than most people can hope for.

24
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:14,449
Speaker 0: NHL playoffs let a lot of teams in.

25
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:16,620
Speaker 0: They should probably eliminate the first round.

26
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,265
Speaker 1: But they played well, like they were.

27
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:20,011
Speaker 1: they were a respectably good team.

28
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:21,216
Speaker 1: They were not embarrassing.

29
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:29,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this season began and they went from being a respectably good team to being like the third worst team in the entire NHL.

30
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:37,780
Speaker 1: I think Buffalo, like the Sabres and the Coyotes were the only teams doing worse than them because at that point the Coyotes hadn't won a single game.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,386
Speaker 1: And that seems to have turned around.

32
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:44,451
Speaker 1: They've won five games in a row now.

33
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,400
Speaker 1: The game we saw last night was actually pretty fucking great.

34
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:52,919
Speaker 0: I was at the first game of this five game win streak and the fifth game of this game win streak.

35
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,067
Speaker 1: It was a good feeling.

36
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:58,040
Speaker 0: Started on Halloween and it's continued until yesterday.

37
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:01,780
Speaker 1: The only the only the bad part was they still gave up some shitty goals.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,624
Speaker 1: So we scored a goal and we start celebrating and then before they even finish announcing that goal Boston just scored.

39
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:10,467
Speaker 0: That is a weird thing.

40
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:11,994
Speaker 0: is that I've always wondered like they don't.

41
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:15,232
Speaker 0: whenever the the pug drops they cut off all music immediately.

42
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:16,320
Speaker 1: But they don't cut off announcements.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,367
Speaker 0: But it's like they'll score a goal then there'll be a face-off for that to start play again and then they'll start while they're playing.

44
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:28,809
Speaker 0: they'll start announcing the goal that was just scored like goal scored by such-and-such.

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,500
Speaker 0: and it's like they're playing and like you're half paying attention.

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,260
Speaker 0: Apparently the players are half paying attention too because that's when people score right away again.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,660
Speaker 0: It's like you should do the announcement while you know, and then drop the puck again.

48
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I like how I'm looking at that.

49
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:49,058
Speaker 1: I just I typed Rangers and I see the game here and it says quote Jimmy Vesey turned nightmare season around in 29 stunning seconds.

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,254
Speaker 1: Vesey's like the rising star, but none of you nerds care even though you should.

51
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:55,499
Speaker 1: but that's what we're up to last night.

52
00:02:56,262 --> 00:03:01,540
Speaker 0: Also, the game started at 8 instead of 7 because it was on NBC because it's a Northeast original 6 matchup.

53
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,030
Speaker 0: so then that you know gets NBC's, you know dick real hard.

54
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:08,480
Speaker 1: Games starting at 8 actually really sucks.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,165
Speaker 1: It's amazing how much that hour means when the game starts at 7. it's like I leave work at the normal time I get some food and I go to the game.

56
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:19,280
Speaker 1: 8 is like I've got too much time to kill to just like stay at work.

57
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:24,344
Speaker 0: I basically spent an hour at like the mermaid house of Wi-Fi just killing time.

58
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:35,780
Speaker 0: I don't know how people do work in those places because it's just noisy and bothersome and people coming in and out and it's like I just wanted to kill people.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like a normal like a co-working space where you literally just like get a tiny office somewhere.

60
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:42,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's not like we work.

61
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:43,400
Speaker 0: Anyway.

62
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:56,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, thing is I'm it's weird because I'm in this giant open floor with like hundreds of people in my new place and yet like other people's conversations never really bother me and like it's just it feels like being in a normal office.

63
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,420
Speaker 1: It's weird.

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's like white noise generators.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:07,500
Speaker 1: I just don't notice like I got to try to figure out but I can open a ticket to change the temperature of like the area right around my desk.

66
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,667
Speaker 1: So it was a little chilly so I did it.

67
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:19,644
Speaker 1: I like open this ticket and then like a minute later it gets like noticeably warmer right at my desk and I walked away a little bit and it was the normal temperature away a little bit.

68
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:20,269
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,540
Speaker 1: It's kind of amazing.

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,782
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,488
Speaker 0: What happens if someone actually has a good office?

72
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:31,232
Speaker 1: and yeah, he does everything and uh, you know, so uh, Oh, I can hit a button to play an ad in the live stream.

73
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:32,056
Speaker 1: That wasn't there before.

74
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:32,820
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

75
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,241
Speaker 0: All right.

76
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:40,914
Speaker 1: Well, it's grayed out because I don't think I've been able to thing good I should make an ad for us and hit play and see what happens.

77
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:41,637
Speaker 0: That would be okay.

78
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:42,339
Speaker 1: That would be funny.

79
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,854
Speaker 0: Would we have to pay YouTube and ourselves for that?

80
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,160
Speaker 1: Maybe if someone clicked on it.

81
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,104
Speaker 1: That would be bad.

82
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:50,888
Speaker 1: You'll all click on it.

83
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,978
Speaker 1: Then I have to pay myself money minus the cut.

84
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:53,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,209
Speaker 1: Maybe I won't do that.

86
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:54,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't do that.

87
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,856
Speaker 1: So, uh, there's only one news really cuz I don't feel like talking about anything else.

88
00:04:58,876 --> 00:04:59,760
Speaker 1: and also it's really funny.

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,401
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:04,220
Speaker 1: If you're not aware out there, there's these things called Funko Pops.

91
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:17,080
Speaker 0: Alright, so the story of Funko Pop as I see it, right, as someone who's a nerd who sees sort of on the out not into that fandom, but you know from outside the fandom looking in, right, is that obviously nerds always like to collect plastic doodads.

92
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:17,843
Speaker 0: Yup.

93
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:22,720
Speaker 1: Especially if those doodads are one, associated with some IP they like and two, there is a set.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Speaker 0: Right, so in college I collected some plastic doodads when I finally had money, but then I stopped.

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,873
Speaker 1: I've still got a bunch of those plastic doodads.

96
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:29,679
Speaker 1: I got that Lupin.

97
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,446
Speaker 0: I got a whole box full of them, but then I stopped.

98
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,274
Speaker 0: cuz I wizened up, right?

99
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:34,740
Speaker 0: Even that Mech Warrior game.

100
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:53,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, um, you know, and then what happened was is like sometime after I moved to like New York after college these like vinyl figurines became real popular like the Kid Robot store and stuff like these, you know, stylish high-fashion like fancy vinyl figurines were like all the rage.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,553
Speaker 0: There was a whole geekery about those which is I could respect it.

102
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:58,200
Speaker 0: like, you know, there was something going on there.

103
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,781
Speaker 1: Like I don't know.

104
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:04,080
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna collect that stuff anymore, but at the same time I have a handful of like high-quality vinyl type things.

105
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 1: They're really high-quality like they feel good.

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,540
Speaker 0: So this company Funko Pop appeared at some point and basically they were like there's a barrel there, right?

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,013
Speaker 0: They were mass at the bottom of this barrel mass market producing that sort of.

108
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:22,060
Speaker 0: they made it like this kind of toy with every possible licensed property imaginable.

109
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:31,914
Speaker 0: But what they did is they made everything from like pro athletes to Ninja Turtles to you know obscure characters in a video game that only a few people know.

110
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:48,040
Speaker 1: now prior to this when you Usually when you saw like your favorite rock star from a thing you like in a particular style It was always like an artist in an artist alley at a con Like I draw in this style and I draw all the characters from all the anime you're like in that style.

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:59,680
Speaker 1: that was a thing and this company seems to just taking that and remove the soul from it and made this like Mass market right crank out IP for things that don't have enough social currency.

112
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:00,605
Speaker 0: It's all sort of like.

113
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,280
Speaker 0: it's certainly Beanie Babies with intellectual property.

114
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:14,484
Speaker 0: so the idea was that hey we can sell to people who like our toys and they'll buy any of them and Will also people who care about a particular intellectual property, which everyone cares about Something right.

115
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:22,011
Speaker 0: as a Transformers fan a football fan a baseball fan, you know metal fan We will have a figure for pretty much everyone.

116
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:27,969
Speaker 0: So everyone's gonna buy a few of these no matter who they are Right, and that's how we'll make some whole ton of monies.

117
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:33,785
Speaker 0: and apparently they got enough money from somewhere to produce all these fucking things Zillions of them everywhere.

118
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:38,480
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's pretty like the process of making these cannot be very different.

119
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,480
Speaker 0: No, there's obviously a factory that spits out just zillions of them for nothing.

120
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,520
Speaker 0: But and then it must cost like 50 cents to make and they charge a lot like dollars for them, right?

121
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:58,755
Speaker 0: but if you look like I knew long ago these things are going down the toilet when I saw them like Stop every single nerd store every single booth at every single con and all the lead like

122
00:07:58,795 --> 00:07:59,998
Speaker 1: a little tower of these and

123
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,617
Speaker 0: all the loot Crates in the universe right specifically the loot crate.

124
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:09,980
Speaker 1: at this point I'm pretty sure loot crate means the things that are in this box are about to fail in the mass market.

125
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:18,758
Speaker 0: Yes Cuz loot crate is a way for companies that make nerdy shit to dump their excess inventory and still get some money for it because if you just put it on a clearance shelf No one will buy it for any amount of money.

126
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:18,940
Speaker 0: again.

127
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:30,490
Speaker 1: The anime cons were ahead of the game because the the low tier like anime Sellers it would show up at conventions would make grab boxes of mystery boxes and stuff like that inventory You can't move.

128
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:36,380
Speaker 1: and when you bought him It was 40 bucks for basically a bunch of garbage that they were literally going to throw away if they couldn't sell right?

129
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,986
Speaker 0: So Funko pop.

130
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:45,160
Speaker 0: when you see so many Funko pop things everywhere Just trying to sell trying so hard to get rid of these things, right?

131
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,837
Speaker 0: You see just so so much, you know over production and such not enough demand.

132
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:50,500
Speaker 0: There was demand.

133
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,782
Speaker 0: There were.

134
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:57,800
Speaker 0: people were into these like almost every nerd I know except for me like has some of these but at the same time people are way into them more than others.

135
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,460
Speaker 0: But the demand did not meet the supply.

136
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,915
Speaker 0: It's not like they were flying off the shelves at the conventions.

137
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:06,180
Speaker 0: at the end of the convention It'd still be tons of these things at Barnes & Noble.

138
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,335
Speaker 0: There's just tons of them at the local game store.

139
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,060
Speaker 0: There's tons of them.

140
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,711
Speaker 1: I guess about them is that I mean I didn't like the aesthetic.

141
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,574
Speaker 1: but that's not.

142
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,420
Speaker 1: that doesn't necessarily mean something's bad.

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,613
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things I don't like.

144
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:17,180
Speaker 0: that succeed.

145
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:21,952
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah But the aesthetic is basically like those black soulless eyes.

146
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:29,280
Speaker 1: and as soon as I saw these start to appear everywhere All I could think was that those black soulless eyes are the soulless eyes of the person who's trying to catch this out.

147
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,932
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I didn't know this was happening or else I might.

148
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:38,328
Speaker 0: I sold short but the Funko pop is its own company It's not owned by anything.

149
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:43,430
Speaker 0: and they made an IPO which seems like the dumbest idea in the universe to go public.

150
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:47,265
Speaker 1: and if I don't there or not there was an IPO and I Knew anyone involved in it.

151
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,960
Speaker 1: I would have I would have pointed out to them that this is a bad idea.

152
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this is not just us like.

153
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,680
Speaker 1: Oh hindsight is not the worst idea.

154
00:09:55,202 --> 00:10:05,140
Speaker 1: I a pair as best I can tell part of the reason the IPO does that I think some initial investors like Took their money back and as a result, they needed money to cover debt.

155
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that, but that's not shady.

156
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:08,875
Speaker 1: stuff like that happens all the time.

157
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:12,836
Speaker 0: Like that's normal business Yeah, but anyway, this IPO is the worst IPO.

158
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:16,460
Speaker 0: like all time They said I said a starting price anyway.

159
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:31,980
Speaker 1: It's so bad that when I typed Funko pop IPO into Google to get the article to talk about this on the show every article I see is either the announcement or All these things talking about how crazy this IPO is gonna be like right here, right?

160
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,934
Speaker 0: Cuz when you're doing an IPO and it hasn't happened yet you pump the news You do all sorts of press releases and stuff with your numbers that you've worked out.

161
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:40,540
Speaker 0: Like please buy our stock.

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,650
Speaker 0: Here's all the great reasons.

163
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,820
Speaker 0: We're gonna perform so well.

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,668
Speaker 0: We're making tons of money in this.

165
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:51,309
Speaker 1: from a little while ago Funko pop IPO could top 245 million more than doubling initial estimate.

166
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:52,592
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Funko pop.

167
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:53,353
Speaker 0: That's a new.

168
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:56,180
Speaker 0: that's a news created by Funko pop before the IPO.

169
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,943
Speaker 0: That's how I peels.

170
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:57,988
Speaker 0: every IPO has this.

171
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:05,095
Speaker 0: any IPO ever has new people pumping the news Full of hype to get people to buy the stock and also to get bots to buy the stock.

172
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,967
Speaker 1: Funko bumps up Size of planned IPO.

173
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:10,519
Speaker 1: so they raised the size of the IPO as well like their projections.

174
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,579
Speaker 1: now I'm not gonna get into explaining how IPOs really work cuz you don't care and you won't understand any.

175
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,725
Speaker 1: well Yeah, but it's it's.

176
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,799
Speaker 1: it's not as complicated as you'd think.

177
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,886
Speaker 1: it's just not really relevant to this.

178
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:30,439
Speaker 1: because what's relevant is that as many of you know, I I do some stock investment and I tend to invest in a lot of nerdy stuff.

179
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:41,047
Speaker 1: But I do it because I understand nerdy stuff Like I know a lot about nerdy company what you want to invest in real estate if you don't know anything about real estate Nerdy things.

180
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,279
Speaker 0: so we invest in nerdy things.

181
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,960
Speaker 1: I've made a lot of money on my stocks over the years.

182
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,197
Speaker 1: Like I'm not gonna lie about that The reason I have in my opinion and I'm not giving you investment advice.

183
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,220
Speaker 1: This is not advice.

184
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,749
Speaker 0: Hey, everyone call the SEC and they'll shut rim down.

185
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:12,583
Speaker 1: Hey, they'll take his patreon monies, but I When I invest whenever I think that Wall Street has an opinion about a nerdy thing But I being the person who is involved in nerdy things Understands it better than they do So.

186
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:19,535
Speaker 1: for example, I bought a shit ton of Hasbro a long time ago because I was like Hasbro's got the my little pony license And holy shit, is that gonna make that money?

187
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,871
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm or Hasbro's got the Disney Princess license

188
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:26,480
Speaker 0: and D&D and yeah This is the coast and magic

189
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:34,440
Speaker 1: I like how I bought a bunch of Toyota stock a long long time ago because they had that scandal about breaks like though the the Accelerators and breaks are failing and killing people.

190
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,011
Speaker 0: You don't want to invest in this company.

191
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:38,906
Speaker 0: that's depending on buying licenses from people to make stuff.

192
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:42,339
Speaker 0: you want to invest in the company that has the license and is selling it to funko pop.

193
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:47,260
Speaker 0: because Even if funko pops don't sell Hasbro still got their money from all the transformers funko pops.

194
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,880
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter whether those funko pops actually sell or not.

195
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,796
Speaker 1: So what happened with the funko pop IPO is not just like ha ha.

196
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,740
Speaker 1: look at this nerd company.

197
00:12:55,282 --> 00:13:07,719
Speaker 1: This is like legit Wall Street people whose job it is to underwrite IPOs Literally had no idea what funko pop was and what its real value proposition was.

198
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,498
Speaker 0: I can imagine the going out of business soon, right?

199
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,219
Speaker 1: Uh, so funko pop shares plunged more than 40 percent after the IP.

200
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,819
Speaker 0: This is actually really good because it means the CEOs and executives and board members of funko pop won't be mega rich from it.

201
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,400
Speaker 0: This was really got more money than we do, but they lost a lot of money.

202
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:34,552
Speaker 1: This was the worst less rich the worst first day for an IPO Full stop in two decades.

203
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,957
Speaker 0: What was the one two decades ago?

204
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:36,740
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

205
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,021
Speaker 1: I don't.

206
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:43,420
Speaker 1: so they're having to caveat that IPO is really dropped off after the like 2008 like when the market went south.

207
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:45,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone just gets a VZ now.

208
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I think that's they don't depend on going public to get investment.

209
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,080
Speaker 1: VC has its own problems.

210
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:55,464
Speaker 1: So I like the pendulum is gonna go back but knows There are many ways.

211
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,200
Speaker 0: there are many ways to get your monies, I wish the pendulum would swing toward just getting a loan.

212
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,739
Speaker 0: No one seems to do that anymore.

213
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:08,380
Speaker 1: It's very interesting to me how little anyone involved in this IPO process seemed to know about like nerd stuff.

214
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,347
Speaker 1: And yet funko like pop.

215
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:18,555
Speaker 1: this company their entire business model seemed to be Panda to the lowest common denominator of nerds like you'd think.

216
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,200
Speaker 1: they can hit that out of the park.

217
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:26,020
Speaker 1: But it seems like they are super overvalued and this is all really funny to me.

218
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:32,020
Speaker 0: I feel like funko pop could have done Well, if they simply produce the right numbers of each funko pop, right?

219
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,634
Speaker 0: It feels like they just made too many of ones that weren't gonna sell.

220
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:36,980
Speaker 0: and maybe right.

221
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,129
Speaker 0: It's like you just have to calculate like aha.

222
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:41,520
Speaker 0: This character has this many fans.

223
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,842
Speaker 0: It's like.

224
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,660
Speaker 0: it's like a. it's like the least popular Harry Potter character, but Harry Potter is still popular.

225
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:48,000
Speaker 0: Well this many if we have if they have good analytics.

226
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,395
Speaker 0: Well, there's this many people who will collect every single Harry Potter funko pop no matter what and is.

227
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:59,000
Speaker 0: this many people are specifically a Fan of this character judging by the amount of fanfiction and we'll make a few extra like one for each store.

228
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:10,702
Speaker 1: so make this many instead of now you go and there's like a thousand of them and no one wants them, so Part of the reason why I think they had so much trouble is that they had a lot of that private equity money Like.

229
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:15,100
Speaker 0: that's how a lot of companies they just set it on fire without caring about spending it wisely.

230
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:16,444
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it's even that.

231
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:21,500
Speaker 1: the problem with private equity money is that those people want to make money

232
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:21,901
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

233
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:32,823
Speaker 1: and as a result, they're not actually that interested sometimes in the long-term viability of your company Mmm, and there's a lot of issues with the things they might want to do that You may not want to

234
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:32,923
Speaker 0: do.

235
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:39,871
Speaker 0: are you saying that those are the people who got stock before the IPO because they own they invested And then they sold it once the IPO happened.

236
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:40,875
Speaker 1: It's not actually stock.

237
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,860
Speaker 1: It's way more complicated than that.

238
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:46,828
Speaker 0: The point is they own part of the company PC as soon as it goes public.

239
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,533
Speaker 0: they sell and then the IPO tank.

240
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:59,491
Speaker 1: if you have a company that say could be worth 10 mil and could make a million dollar profit a year like forever, but you take a hundred mil or 500 mil no one.

241
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,879
Speaker 0: No one can wait a hundred years.

242
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:03,269
Speaker 0: I mean even I'm not great.

243
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:08,351
Speaker 0: I'm like against greed, but honestly if I gives you a hundred mil I can't wait a hundred years to give a hundred mil back.

244
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:23,043
Speaker 1: But basically if Like if your investments are too big your company will have to grow bigger than might actually be viable or than what you might have Actually wanted to do if you didn't take all that money like if you gave geek nights 500 grand.

245
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:25,289
Speaker 1: we probably keep doing what we're doing now and quit our jobs.

246
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:33,011
Speaker 1: if you gave us like 500 million dollars I would just buy like we would just.

247
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:34,760
Speaker 1: I would just retire forever and never do anything.

248
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,920
Speaker 0: I would buy a cheap sports team somewhere and then yeah instead of doing geek nights and then you'd get paid back from that.

249
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,700
Speaker 1: I could make more returns for you by investing that money just back in the market.

250
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,419
Speaker 0: I could just buy an index fund and give you half of the interest.

251
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:51,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I couldn't do anything with that money to make geek nights better.

252
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,279
Speaker 0: No, there's no way.

253
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:02,180
Speaker 0: There's no way geek nights could make even at the most successful geek nights If it was like a Broadway show and a TV show on primetime could make back five hundred million dollars.

254
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:06,940
Speaker 1: but the other thing is that I've never liked Funko pop because it really feels like.

255
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:13,400
Speaker 1: The only reason this exists at all in the scale that it did was that and this is the same thing again.

256
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,207
Speaker 1: Anime cons are always kind of ahead of this.

257
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:18,700
Speaker 1: nerds would be fans of some anime in America.

258
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:30,439
Speaker 1: but they want merch because a lot of nerds really want like this social currency to carry around and Officially licensed merch lagged behind the thing that they were into by three to five years.

259
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:39,300
Speaker 1: As a result they would buy bootleg shit because they really needed a full metal alchemist t-shirt and plastic thing and plush to prove that They are fans of that thing.

260
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I just got over needing to have a plastic figurine like, you know, 15 some odd years ago.

261
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,680
Speaker 0: And now I'm done with that part of my life and I have a bunch of figurines in the closet and that's it.

262
00:17:50,041 --> 00:18:03,400
Speaker 1: I'm happy to express my fandom for say little witch academia by when talking to other anime fans saying things like hey guys I really like little witch academia, you know in a Gundam I can buy a few Gundams because that's an activity of building them just like Legos.

263
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:08,280
Speaker 0: There's an activity going on but you buy a Funko pop and you put it on the shelf and it sits there looking at you.

264
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,839
Speaker 0: I guess you spend a bunch of money on that.

265
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:27,380
Speaker 1: The reason I didn't trust Funko pop in the end was that the business model of selling the social currency That of IPS that you don't own two people who literally build their personal identity Around those IPS and thus that social currency.

266
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:34,658
Speaker 1: that demographic is not a demographic you want to tie yourself to know as a company and doesn't have a lot of money because then you get.

267
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:41,219
Speaker 1: then you're gonna Turn into like Marvel and DC comics themselves the floppies and the demographic they cater to.

268
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:50,348
Speaker 1: and I definitely noticed in my nerd dealings that most of the people have money if They're buying the like vinyl nerdy stuff.

269
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:51,753
Speaker 1: They're not buying the Funko pops.

270
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:55,979
Speaker 1: They're buying the like much more expensive smaller run limited things.

271
00:18:56,782 --> 00:19:03,840
Speaker 1: They're not more discerning in terms of buying social currency and wrapping their identity up, but they're not buying the Funko pops.

272
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:10,496
Speaker 1: so this is all just kind of funny and I Laugh at it more than I'm saddened by it.

273
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:16,846
Speaker 1: what anyway?

274
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,980
Speaker 1: things of the day?

275
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,573
Speaker 1: So I gotta say I gotta tip my hat to Scott.

276
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,840
Speaker 0: your thing of the day My thing of the days are always better than your thing of the day.

277
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,450
Speaker 0: It's just this week in particular.

278
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,880
Speaker 0: I had a plus things the day.

279
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,839
Speaker 1: Do our thing of the day off?

280
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,334
Speaker 0: this is just showing is just a Key example of how much better my things of the day usually are.

281
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:38,599
Speaker 0: but it's just this week.

282
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:43,599
Speaker 1: So I was looking at stats though in the forum my things that they get clicked on more often than yours do.

283
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:43,900
Speaker 0: how do you?

284
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,342
Speaker 0: Know that?

285
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:47,275
Speaker 1: because it says how many times any link I clicked on in any forum post.

286
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:55,377
Speaker 1: Uh-huh So that's I haven't looked at old threads to see if that still is true But that there's an interesting metric we can use.

287
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:58,134
Speaker 0: in the future We'll have to make one of those things really get shows two things.

288
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:01,079
Speaker 0: the day you click one Which you and you think is better like hot or not?

289
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,320
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you just keeps picking random ones and then at the end it'll be like aha Well, we were gonna do at some point is do a thing of the day Thursday.

290
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:08,720
Speaker 1: This is like about our Thursday shows.

291
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:21,405
Speaker 1: That's like if we really don't have an idea is we're both gonna pick what we think are our own personal best top 10 things of the day and then try to do some sort of tournament with them and let you guys decide who is truly the king of Things

292
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,906
Speaker 0: Thousands of things of the day and how many of them are 404. now, I'd like figure out.

293
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,190
Speaker 1: Yep That's why we haven't done it yet.

294
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,989
Speaker 0: I'd have to take me a whole day just to go through my things of the day and figure out which ones.

295
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,006
Speaker 1: Meaning this episode is not happening until it's like the worst weather outside.

296
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:39,198
Speaker 1: It's not gonna happen Someday ten years from now.

297
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,010
Speaker 1: We're really out of episode ideas.

298
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,087
Speaker 1: So I'll do my thing today.

299
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,870
Speaker 1: first Because Scott's is just - I can't get over how great this is.

300
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,160
Speaker 1: So I chose a Simpsons appropriate thing of the day because I realized that I quote.

301
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:57,009
Speaker 1: my favorite character on The Simpsons was always Moses like.

302
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,068
Speaker 1: but My second favorite character was always Gil Gunderson.

303
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:05,187
Speaker 1: All gail old gills eating food tonight.

304
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:05,488
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

305
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,920
Speaker 1: And he's done in that many episodes for what he is is pure gold.

306
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:17,072
Speaker 1: and I realized that I quote Gil a lot Like some people quote like certain things from The Simpsons like that's their thing Gil's.

307
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:17,894
Speaker 1: the one I quote.

308
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,862
Speaker 1: and I realized that a bunch of our friends.

309
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:24,721
Speaker 1: They assumed I was quoting something rightly But they didn't know is from The Simpsons.

310
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,730
Speaker 1: They didn't know who old Gil was.

311
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,120
Speaker 0: I did not know kennel Gil.

312
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,582
Speaker 1: get a taste.

313
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,729
Speaker 1: I'll look at that brass ring.

314
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,145
Speaker 1: So this is a compilation of the best of Gil Gunderson.

315
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:41,830
Speaker 0: Okay, great I'm sure as rim picked The Simpsons thing today because y'all saw that I had already picked The Simpsons thing of the day.

316
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:47,690
Speaker 0: This is steamed hams Except it's a custom guitar hero song.

317
00:21:47,790 --> 00:22:01,189
Speaker 0: apparently there's like a mini genre of this on YouTube that I wasn't aware of where you'll take something that is Definitely not rhythm a rhythm song and then make a guitar hero track custom guitar hero track to it.

318
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:12,025
Speaker 0: So this is literally just that scene from The Simpsons where Super Nintendo Chalmers goes to Skinner's house for dinner Like top five favorite scenes in the entire run.

319
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:20,610
Speaker 0: then on top of it There's a guitar hero fretboard with the dots coming down that you can I guess play if you've got a modded guitar hero set up.

320
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:21,353
Speaker 1: It is.

321
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:25,050
Speaker 0: and if you go on YouTube and look at related videos, there's tons of these things.

322
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,650
Speaker 0: But this is the best of them by far kind of like a rhythm heaven.

323
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:31,149
Speaker 1: Like that's another thing people would make like fake rhythm heavens.

324
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the pony one was probably the best one of those should just put DDR hours instead.

325
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:35,424
Speaker 0: Yeah.

326
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:46,750
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, so I did find someone made arrows and I found this by accident But it seems like the thing that I would seek out or that I would have secretly made.

327
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:50,990
Speaker 1: But someone made pretty good arrows to piss Admiral dildo captain.

328
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:52,731
Speaker 0: Oh, but yeah but anyway the the.

329
00:22:53,032 --> 00:23:06,189
Speaker 0: what's fun about this is that the the notes you have to play not only include all of the dialogue between Skinner and Chalmers but also the background music like didn't do which you call steamed hams.

330
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:16,588
Speaker 1: Yes The Aurora Borealis The see I got literally top five Simpsons scenes like.

331
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:23,270
Speaker 1: I Cannot express to you how much I like this thing today because of how much I like this scene.

332
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,609
Speaker 1: So Scott you make a fine steamed ham.

333
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:36,425
Speaker 1: In the moment we were at gamer X East it was exactly what it purported to be And we have a weekend to relax.

334
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:37,370
Speaker 1: and then next.

335
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:42,559
Speaker 1: well, we gotta prepare but Next weekend is packs unplugged.

336
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:43,081
Speaker 0: Oh crap.

337
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,110
Speaker 1: It is the tabletop only packs.

338
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:50,267
Speaker 1: We will be there enforcing and doing an event on Saturday and tabletop tourney for 3 30 p.m.

339
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:50,990
Speaker 1: For two hours.

340
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,618
Speaker 1: It's just gonna be great and you should be there.

341
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:58,539
Speaker 0: the badges for packs east one on sale today Which for you is probably already yesterday.

342
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,544
Speaker 1: They're already sold out.

343
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:00,046
Speaker 1: You're fucked.

344
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,050
Speaker 1: The hotels are sold out.

345
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:04,343
Speaker 0: If you're gonna be there though, so away probably.

346
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:05,930
Speaker 1: yep, we're gonna be enforced.

347
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,105
Speaker 0: We'd haven't had like some panel approved, but it's like 99 submissions are not even open.

348
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:14,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's 99% chance We're gonna enforce there again, and we'll be there again.

349
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:17,235
Speaker 0: We already got 100% chance will enforce.

350
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,101
Speaker 0: cuz we're already they could reject us.

351
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:20,285
Speaker 0: No, we're counting.

352
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:21,930
Speaker 0: I'm accounting for that possibility.

353
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,882
Speaker 1: I don't think they reject people who are already registered.

354
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:29,096
Speaker 0: Listen, there's a non zero percent chance They could decide.

355
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:29,479
Speaker 0: you know what?

356
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:30,668
Speaker 0: We don't like those veganized guys.

357
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,623
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean there's a chance that they could just cancel packs East like.

358
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:33,864
Speaker 1: well.

359
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:34,688
Speaker 0: Yeah.

360
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,153
Speaker 0: Sorry guys We also have to account for that.

361
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:37,337
Speaker 1: You know what?

362
00:24:37,438 --> 00:24:38,221
Speaker 1: I don't account for that.

363
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:42,466
Speaker 0: Okay in the not accounting for things like that We're a hundred percent going to be there.

364
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:46,844
Speaker 1: Yep I mean that is like worrying about the existential solipsistic nature of the universe.

365
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:52,570
Speaker 1: Like I don't roll that Determination into my chances of whether or not packs will happen anyway.

366
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:57,830
Speaker 1: But I actually only Saturday is sold out because packs East is a good packs.

367
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:06,910
Speaker 1: But it's now four days Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Yep, but packs East has probably the highest percent percentage of day trippers like people who literally only come for a day.

368
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,250
Speaker 0: Also, there's hotel issues.

369
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:14,450
Speaker 0: We tried to book a two-bedroom for Wednesday night Thursday night Friday night Saturday night Sunday night check out on Monday.

370
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,234
Speaker 1: there are zero of those at Hotels that matter.

371
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:23,030
Speaker 1: and I say that matter because the main problem with packs East is that it is the biggest packs by.

372
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:26,870
Speaker 0: People keep taking shuttles to these faraway hotels on the other side of town.

373
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,844
Speaker 0: Only we don't do that shit.

374
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:35,089
Speaker 1: There are only Arguably four or five hotels that are within a reasonable distance.

375
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:41,735
Speaker 0: Yeah So the hotel that we wanted to stay at their two bedrooms didn't have Wednesday night So I had to.

376
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,329
Speaker 0: we got to one bedrooms.

377
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,090
Speaker 0: It's not ideal in a different hotel that is still right next to that one.

378
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:50,510
Speaker 1: This nearly doubled our costs for packs East.

379
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:54,704
Speaker 1: I'm telling you guys pack South cost less to go to then packs East.

380
00:25:55,005 --> 00:26:00,190
Speaker 0: no matter where you live Even no matter where you live on earth pack South is cheaper than packs.

381
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,945
Speaker 1: If you live in Southie and are just going to like walk to PAX East.

382
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:05,246
Speaker 1: Yes.

383
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:05,868
Speaker 1: This is cheaper.

384
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,072
Speaker 0: Sure That's right.

385
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:10,182
Speaker 1: But if you live in New York pack South is cheaper than packs East.

386
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:18,210
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and especially now that there's a fourth day If you can get to PAX East without using a car from your house, then it's cheaper.

387
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:18,952
Speaker 0: otherwise not.

388
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:28,842
Speaker 1: but yeah, it's gonna be a real busy time for us because right after PAX East or packs unplugged is Holidays and then more holidays and then we got New Year's mag.

389
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:35,248
Speaker 1: fast packs unplug or pack pack South one two three boom boom boom and then packs East is like right after that.

390
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:46,240
Speaker 1: so anime Boston is great and really the only reason we stopped going to anime Boston is that I need a break between all that Nonsense and the nonsense that happens starting in May.

391
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:49,222
Speaker 1: So yeah, we got a lot of cons coming up Mm-hmm.

392
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,605
Speaker 1: Otherwise follow scops YouTube channel and my youtube channel because there's a ton of crap there.

393
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:57,778
Speaker 0: all the other internet services That you can think of social media networks and whatever.

394
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:01,769
Speaker 0: look for me rim and or geek nights on those things because we are there.

395
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:05,001
Speaker 1: So snacks because Thursdays is like.

396
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,170
Speaker 0: are you sure we didn't do the show already?

397
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,289
Speaker 1: I could did a cursory like half-assed search.

398
00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:13,583
Speaker 1: Okay, and I don't know if we did it.

399
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:17,566
Speaker 1: if we did it in the past I'm sure someone will say something if no one says anything.

400
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,270
Speaker 0: That's fine.

401
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,080
Speaker 0: Let's let's let's be pedantic cuz that's.

402
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:22,988
Speaker 0: that's how geek nights do right.

403
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:23,610
Speaker 1: Wikipedia.

404
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:28,165
Speaker 1: What is a portion of food smaller than a regular meal?

405
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:28,547
Speaker 0: What?

406
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:29,510
Speaker 0: how big is a meal?

407
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,111
Speaker 1: What if I?

408
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:31,054
Speaker 1: so let's go to the Wikipedia.

409
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:35,448
Speaker 1: wait, so there's Wikipedia articles on both food measuring calories like.

410
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:40,410
Speaker 1: so Scott Do you want to argue about what constitutes food or what constitutes a meal a meal?

411
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,158
Speaker 0: Cuz the snack is smaller than a regular meal meal.

412
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,345
Speaker 1: a meal is an eating occasion.

413
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:49,689
Speaker 1: eating has its own Wikipedia page That takes place at a certain time.

414
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:58,850
Speaker 1: Oh That actually sets us up pretty well and includes Specific prepared food or the food eaten on that occasion.

415
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,497
Speaker 1: Okay, so meals are scheduled.

416
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:02,941
Speaker 1: snacks are unscheduled.

417
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,743
Speaker 0: I agree with this.

418
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:09,501
Speaker 0: snacks are the things you eat in between Breakfast lunch dinner and not dessert either now.

419
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would argue if you it's like.

420
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:11,829
Speaker 0: it's like.

421
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,490
Speaker 0: oh I already ate breakfast which is a nice breakfast sandwich.

422
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,038
Speaker 0: It's not yet time for lunch.

423
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:21,383
Speaker 0: some pizza, but I'm hungry and it's morning I will eat this fruit and that counts as a snack.

424
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,130
Speaker 0: or oh it is lunches past.

425
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,162
Speaker 0: I already ate pizza and I'm not yet home to cook a dinner.

426
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:29,215
Speaker 0: I am still at work, but I am hungry And it's three o'clock.

427
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:31,166
Speaker 0: Let me eat this granola bar.

428
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:31,830
Speaker 0: That is a snack.

429
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,469
Speaker 1: So I think the scheduling aspect is what makes the difference.

430
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,290
Speaker 1: Primarily so that means that if you are the kind of person who eats second breakfast, that is not a snack.

431
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:50,690
Speaker 1: That is just another meal and you're gonna get fat or your hobbit All right, so I I think we need to argue about what food is but I actually I'm gonna click on this Wikipedia article.

432
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,466
Speaker 1: All right food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organ.

433
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:57,550
Speaker 0: I agree with that anyway.

434
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,353
Speaker 0: so Snacking like.

435
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:02,864
Speaker 0: I guess I don't remember what snacks I ate when I was a vivid.

436
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,652
Speaker 1: I actually yeah, baby I don't.

437
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:11,183
Speaker 1: but from elementary school on I have a Perfect memory of the kinds of snacks that I ate.

438
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:11,344
Speaker 0: Yep.

439
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:12,410
Speaker 0: There are many snacks I ate.

440
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:17,728
Speaker 0: I ate a cup of yogurt with fruit on the bottom when I was a kid on the bottom.

441
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:18,270
Speaker 1: I hated yogurt.

442
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,418
Speaker 1: I never ate yogurt as a kid.

443
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:20,345
Speaker 1: That shit was disgusting.

444
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:20,990
Speaker 0: I like yogurt.

445
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,501
Speaker 0: I had to have fruit on the bottom.

446
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,690
Speaker 0: just yogurt was no good.

447
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:34,710
Speaker 1: I also liked jelly to up to a point and then at some point in my young childhood I decided that jelly was bullshit, right and I stopped eating jelly of any kind until I became an adult and I started eating jelly again.

448
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:35,245
Speaker 0: Okay

449
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:52,783
Speaker 1: Others Remember so a thing I would do when I was a young kid and it's so specific and I remember this partly because it came Up in conversation recently because I once fell down the stairs and hurt my neck real bad had to take a ride in an ambulance Mm-hmm, and I remember the moment when I fell down the stairs.

450
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:57,118
Speaker 1: My mom thought I was pushed by a ghost But I actually just slipped.

451
00:29:57,338 --> 00:30:09,490
Speaker 1: and I remember so specifically that my heel of my left foot Brushed the front of the next step instead of landing firmly on the step and then I slid like Forward off of it and that caused me to roll down the stairs.

452
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:21,870
Speaker 1: But just as the reason I was distracted walking down the stairs It was jelly was that I had been in the kitchen eating snacks Right before this and I ran upstairs.

453
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:22,816
Speaker 1: I don't remember why.

454
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:25,210
Speaker 1: I went upstairs to do something and then I came back.

455
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:33,610
Speaker 1: I was coming back down the stairs and I was thinking to myself Should I eat the cheese it and then the alphabets?

456
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:38,989
Speaker 1: Well, like one of the other or should I combine them before I put them in my mouth?

457
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, why savory alphabet?

458
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:43,644
Speaker 0: alphabets are like a gross.

459
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:45,530
Speaker 0: They're basically Cheerios in a different shape.

460
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:46,295
Speaker 1: They were sweeter.

461
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:46,838
Speaker 1: They had like sugar.

462
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:47,523
Speaker 1: I had sugar in there.

463
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,142
Speaker 1: I never ate discuss Alphabets in a bowl without milk and I'm one bowl of that.

464
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,030
Speaker 1: and I also had a bowl of cheese.

465
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:54,953
Speaker 0: What the hell's wrong.

466
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:59,089
Speaker 1: and I remember vaguely that I had some sort of rhythm to like how many of each I would eat.

467
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,243
Speaker 0: So I remember a lot like cheeses.

468
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:02,170
Speaker 0: I should buy cheeses again.

469
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:02,491
Speaker 0: I

470
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:22,570
Speaker 1: used to actually through elementary school middle school high school I actually thought a lot about snacking like I would prepare snacks like they were meals like I'd come home from high school and I would like go to the kitchen and get out like three kinds of cheese and like Make all these different slices and like arrange them on a plate with crackers and croutons and peanuts

471
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:23,752
Speaker 0: Probably

472
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,122
Speaker 1: like a third of a pound of cheese.

473
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:28,070
Speaker 0: all told I would just go into the kitchen.

474
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:33,890
Speaker 1: I would sit at the computer Eating this cheese and snacks while I was doing whatever it is.

475
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,857
Speaker 1: I did on computers before the internet was really

476
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:50,947
Speaker 0: all I did if I was hungry and I would go into the kitchen and try To find something and I take it and eat it and then I'd go back and then if I was still hungry I'd go back again and get something else and was still hungry go back again Get something else and repeat but I would never eat the same thing two times in a day.

477
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:53,057
Speaker 1: You you're weird about that.

478
00:31:53,117 --> 00:31:57,515
Speaker 1: even now, you know, we'll be like, hey, let's get some Italian food You'll be like I had Italian food.

479
00:31:57,575 --> 00:32:02,430
Speaker 0: Okay, so if it's a meal, I can't have the same scheduled meal two days in a row.

480
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,527
Speaker 0: So if I ate Indian food yesterday, I can't eat Indian today.

481
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:09,243
Speaker 1: higher Ethnic class of food is what's covered.

482
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:13,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I ate Italian food yesterday American food two days in a row.

483
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,830
Speaker 0: if I ate hamburger yesterday, I don't get hamburger today.

484
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,196
Speaker 1: But would you eat a hot dog today?

485
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,025
Speaker 1: Is that the same class of food?

486
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:24,564
Speaker 1: Probably not Okay, but yet all Indian food is the same is pad.

487
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:27,338
Speaker 1: See you and pad kebab Those are two different kinds of food.

488
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,770
Speaker 0: if I ate Thai food yesterday won't eat that food.

489
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:32,278
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've just got racist food preferences.

490
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:38,639
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is just saying if it's a snack Right say like a banana, right?

491
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:39,702
Speaker 0: Well, that's not a meal.

492
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:41,750
Speaker 0: I can eat one banana each day.

493
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:48,976
Speaker 0: I just can't eat a tube banana in the same day unless it's some extenuating circumstance like long bike ride After a bike ride.

494
00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:50,644
Speaker 1: So the other day I ran a half marathon.

495
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:51,930
Speaker 0: We have free bananas for you.

496
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,364
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I will eat ten of them.

497
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:59,352
Speaker 1: the other day I ran a half marathon and when I run a half marathon usually means I run to some distant point and then I take the Subway home.

498
00:32:59,694 --> 00:32:59,835
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

499
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:02,408
Speaker 1: So cuz I don't want to run a big loop cuz I'll get bored.

500
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:06,538
Speaker 1: Yes I ran up to the top Manhattan and There's fucking nothing up there.

501
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:08,910
Speaker 0: Like there's like a fruit stand in the corner.

502
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,963
Speaker 0: No, I'm talking like 225th Street even a dirty hot water dog.

503
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:13,765
Speaker 1: So up there.

504
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:14,748
Speaker 1: There's no street food.

505
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:17,093
Speaker 1: on a Saturday There's delis.

506
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:19,844
Speaker 1: that looked so bad that I would rather like I wouldn't.

507
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,490
Speaker 0: you can get some yellow food group from there.

508
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:24,100
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, I did not trust the yellow food group in that place.

509
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,690
Speaker 0: You know wrapped in sealed yellow food group.

510
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:29,629
Speaker 1: Well, so on my body rejects food like that at this point.

511
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,256
Speaker 0: Like not hungry though.

512
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:34,081
Speaker 1: I would read no matter how hungry I am.

513
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,027
Speaker 1: I'd rather go hungry than eat a Twinkie.

514
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:41,382
Speaker 0: I mean I've never been hungry enough to eat the Twinkie.

515
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:45,345
Speaker 0: not they don't make Twinkies anymore But there is a point at which I will eat.

516
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:50,003
Speaker 1: when I was a kid I would eat like two packs of Twinkies and I actually didn't like Twinkies.

517
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:52,130
Speaker 0: I was all about the ring ding ring.

518
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:59,389
Speaker 0: So I like those hostess cupcakes, but I like those are okay But I like the non chocolate one one.

519
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:03,385
Speaker 0: There was a snack that I had a lot when I was high school and such with cakes.

520
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:10,270
Speaker 0: No, it was a box full of Not real ring dings, but these you would get into it.

521
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,630
Speaker 0: There were these little plastically wrapped two tiny ring dings.

522
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,630
Speaker 0: So you'd go in there and grab and open the plastic and there'd be two tiny ring dings.

523
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:18,614
Speaker 1: How tiny cuz.

524
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:20,043
Speaker 1: I would get the box like this.

525
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,149
Speaker 1: Bing I get the bot.

526
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,664
Speaker 1: Okay Cuz I had the box of zebra cakes and they'd always come with individually wrapped plastic things.

527
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:27,610
Speaker 1: that had two zebra cakes each Mm-hmm.

528
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:28,436
Speaker 0: But yeah, I was like.

529
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:31,170
Speaker 0: it was like mini ring dings in a box and you get two at a time.

530
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:32,114
Speaker 1: so I ran all.

531
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:44,029
Speaker 1: I ran from my apartment all the way to the top of Manhattan and it was like I ran like 14 or 15 miles and I Needed to eat something and there's nothing up there except the gentrifying is happening.

532
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:51,010
Speaker 1: So there's this like super overpriced bullshit food seller type supermarket in the middle of this.

533
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:59,653
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so I go in there and I basically bought like four bananas and a much more of those bananas way too much money Like 40 cents each.

534
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:08,538
Speaker 1: Okay, and a small bag of clementines and I just ate them all as I rode the subway home Because the biker eating a bike ride.

535
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,826
Speaker 1: tires are out run as far as you normally bike that.

536
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:11,408
Speaker 1: no, I don't.

537
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:14,881
Speaker 1: yeah My body was like I will kill you if you don't need something.

538
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,886
Speaker 1: It was like eat oranges eat lemons If you have to it's other snacks that I see.

539
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:20,610
Speaker 0: it's weird like this.

540
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,410
Speaker 0: I gotta address something the snacks I eat back in the day or nothing like the snacks I eat today.

541
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,470
Speaker 0: Oh back at some point I changed from one kind of snack to a different kind.

542
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:34,982
Speaker 1: So I when I was like when I was elementary school up through high school The primary snack I ate was savory.

543
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:41,744
Speaker 1: usually snack mixes Like doodads was my favorite snack mix in the world like that when doodads disappeared.

544
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,329
Speaker 1: I literally do.

545
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:45,537
Speaker 1: that is I don't know if they were sold around.

546
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,545
Speaker 0: the things I ate before right.

547
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,850
Speaker 0: I ate the mini ring ding.

548
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:51,161
Speaker 0: I ate the string cheese.

549
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,930
Speaker 0: You get one string cheese, right?

550
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:55,058
Speaker 0: I would eat yet.

551
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,170
Speaker 0: I don't know if they still make these as a kudos.

552
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:02,690
Speaker 1: Like imagine checks and checks makes but like way more flavorful, okay, so I eat these kudos bars.

553
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,004
Speaker 0: I don't know if they still make them but what they are.

554
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:05,890
Speaker 1: I remember those things.

555
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,914
Speaker 1: I did not like those things.

556
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:10,550
Speaker 0: So imagine like nowadays they have bars like kind bar, right?

557
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:13,670
Speaker 1: Oh my god, my by crave doodads so much now.

558
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,970
Speaker 0: So a kind bar is kind of like this stiff granola bar that's supposed to be healthy or whatever.

559
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:24,970
Speaker 0: Right a kudos bar is basically that with absolutely no pretending to be healthy, right?

560
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:33,109
Speaker 0: It's it's granola filled with like chocolate chips and some kind of sticky sugar to hold it together and then 100% sealed in chocolate.

561
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:36,963
Speaker 0: This chocolate on every edge like that ice cream on a stick.

562
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:38,570
Speaker 0: That's just chocolate with the ice cream inside of it.

563
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:39,702
Speaker 0: It's like that.

564
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:44,984
Speaker 0: so it's like yeah It's a granola bar that does not pretend to be a healthy kind or whatever.

565
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,070
Speaker 0: crud with those like Clif bar.

566
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,890
Speaker 0: It's like no no, no, this is chocolate.

567
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:50,279
Speaker 1: It's interesting.

568
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:54,584
Speaker 1: I don't treat Bars as snacks like I. never I never.

569
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:55,430
Speaker 0: a bar is a snack.

570
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:56,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's the thing.

571
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,650
Speaker 1: I never but I never eat those kinds of things in the context of I'm sitting here and I'm hungry.

572
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:07,368
Speaker 1: I only ever eat those things in the context of I am on a long sporting thing and I need to bring.

573
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:08,070
Speaker 0: I'm talking about.

574
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,355
Speaker 0: You know the olden days, right?

575
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,448
Speaker 0: I would all see, you know yogurt with the fruit on the bottom and eat.

576
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:17,184
Speaker 1: I mostly eat things that were like actual fruit like an actual banana.

577
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,150
Speaker 0: Oh pretzel stick out all pretzel stick.

578
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,866
Speaker 0: The thing with pretzel stick right is that we get the big rods.

579
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:23,790
Speaker 0: rods are the way to go.

580
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:26,461
Speaker 0: I would always eat two pretzel rod.

581
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:27,706
Speaker 1: I didn't like cigar.

582
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:28,550
Speaker 1: I just keep eating them.

583
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:30,290
Speaker 1: Just hold it in my mouth like a cigar and suck on it.

584
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, two pretzel rod.

585
00:37:31,354 --> 00:37:35,693
Speaker 0: and the way I'd eat it is I'd eat all the salt first and then I need the pretzel Right.

586
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:38,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I would do it through the other pretzel.

587
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,385
Speaker 1: I pretty much when I snacked I only wanted cheese and snack mix type things and nuts.

588
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,230
Speaker 0: if it was a cheese situation It was the string cheese.

589
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:53,843
Speaker 0: But actually when I was way younger you would I would get the thing that was Four crackers a red plastic stick and a little cheese bucket.

590
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:58,735
Speaker 1: Oh when I was in elementary school I love those in first grade I eat like two or three of them.

591
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:00,243
Speaker 0: one go in first grade.

592
00:38:00,323 --> 00:38:09,530
Speaker 0: in the toy section of the room There was a bowl a big bowl like a mixing bowl Yeah And it was 100% full with red plastic sticks that were cleaned off after everyone ate and tossed.

593
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,366
Speaker 0: It was like there must have been a thousands of red sticks in this bowl.

594
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:14,230
Speaker 0: It was great.

595
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:20,558
Speaker 1: Yep, so I got to address something because in the stream a lot of people to get you the fact that I stopped eating jelly And they all have the same question.

596
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,548
Speaker 1: So what'd you put on your peanut butter and jelly?

597
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,050
Speaker 1: You know what?

598
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,376
Speaker 1: I'm not I'm gonna be blunt.

599
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:27,090
Speaker 1: I think peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are fucking disgusting.

600
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,732
Speaker 0: No, they're great.

601
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,260
Speaker 1: I and I like savory sweet combinations.

602
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:31,463
Speaker 1: I like peanut butter.

603
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:33,690
Speaker 1: I like peanut butter sandwiches peanut butter toast.

604
00:38:34,232 --> 00:38:37,362
Speaker 1: I like jelly preserves and marmalade and all those things.

605
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:40,853
Speaker 1: peanut butter and jelly on white bread is Disgusting.

606
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:40,993
Speaker 0: Okay.

607
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:41,657
Speaker 0: So here's the thing.

608
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,250
Speaker 0: white bread is disgusting has to be wheat bread.

609
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:45,113
Speaker 0: I can't do.

610
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:45,274
Speaker 0: no.

611
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:47,662
Speaker 1: white peanut butter and jelly on bread is disgusting.

612
00:38:47,843 --> 00:38:49,670
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, I do not like that.

613
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:50,593
Speaker 0: It's so good.

614
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:51,998
Speaker 0: It's a staple.

615
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,130
Speaker 1: But what really amazes me is that as a kid?

616
00:38:56,151 --> 00:39:06,570
Speaker 1: I would eat snacks all and when I say kid, I mean all the way through high school I would eat snacks that are bigger than meals I eat today Like I would get home from school and maybe added the snacks together.

617
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:19,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd literally eat like a third a pound of cheese and like half a box of crackers and just like wall I was fucking around on the computer Pretty much right before dinner and then I'd eat dinner and I'd be totally fine.

618
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:22,649
Speaker 1: Yeah nowadays I basically like I almost never eat snacks.

619
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,909
Speaker 0: So that's the thing is like in college snacks are all over the place because food was hard to get.

620
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:29,136
Speaker 1: yeah I was dead in college.

621
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:29,438
Speaker 1: That's it.

622
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,425
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't snacks.

623
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:35,544
Speaker 0: That was fuel like Calories I consume just like food all over the place random who knows what.

624
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:39,190
Speaker 1: right if you got calories in college You fucking ate it cuz you didn't know when the next calories.

625
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then once you know entered the real world like the snacking.

626
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:44,250
Speaker 1: so there's no animals.

627
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:49,730
Speaker 1: Right, if you like you rescue certain kinds of animals They'll do a thing where they're food aggressive because they were deprived of food.

628
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:53,450
Speaker 1: So when they have access to food, they don't trust that they'll still have access to be eat all of it.

629
00:39:53,751 --> 00:40:04,608
Speaker 1: I was food aggressive in college and it wasn't until I had like several years in a row of having money and literally like Going to the grocery store and just buying whatever I wanted instead of thinking I can afford $14 worth of groceries.

630
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:10,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, but nowadays like I've almost eliminated all like, you know, there were times when I would be snacking right?

631
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,681
Speaker 0: I switched from.

632
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:16,490
Speaker 0: you know I stopped eating yogurt with fruit on the bottom and started eating the fah-yay Greek yogurt with the fruit next to it.

633
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went on to the ciggas and that's where it's the only yogurt.

634
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,602
Speaker 0: It's gross.

635
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:20,485
Speaker 1: It's so good.

636
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:20,967
Speaker 0: It's gross.

637
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,697
Speaker 1: So good Try the cream ciggas.

638
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:24,861
Speaker 1: It's in the flat bit.

639
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:25,624
Speaker 1: Try it once.

640
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:26,367
Speaker 1: It's not what you think.

641
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,050
Speaker 0: No, it's no good.

642
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,774
Speaker 1: It's real good.

643
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:28,538
Speaker 0: Why would I do that?

644
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:30,047
Speaker 0: when I can stick with my fah-yay is okay.

645
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:33,121
Speaker 1: I mean, I only like the fah-yay with the honey though.

646
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,407
Speaker 0: Maybe all of them are good.

647
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:47,499
Speaker 0: There's so many flavors kiwis Pear berries so mangoes when I snack Cuz when I start.

648
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:52,229
Speaker 1: when I worked at IBM like way back in the day I snacked all the time for the vending machines because I was just always hungry.

649
00:40:53,452 --> 00:41:00,869
Speaker 1: But now I work in a place that just has like free snacks all the time And it's funny because they definitely want you to like be healthy about it.

650
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:13,609
Speaker 1: So like most of the snacks are like bean crisp type things But they know there is garbage food if you want it, but it's like here's a tiny wrapper with one Oreo cookie in it.

651
00:41:14,212 --> 00:41:16,507
Speaker 1: Mmm, no good, but they do have.

652
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:16,990
Speaker 1: there's this thing.

653
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:32,504
Speaker 1: There's this cart that comes out every day at like 2 30 and it's there until the end of the day And it's snack mix like the kind of snack mix I keep talking about like Chex Mix doodads type stuff and I've been eating that again cuz I still like that kind of food.

654
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:38,269
Speaker 0: the other snack the other snacks I still eat is like a fruit like I'll go to the Apple House buy a bunch of apples and eat one apple every day.

655
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:43,240
Speaker 0: or You know, I got like a bag of nuts.

656
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:53,349
Speaker 1: right I'll get like a bag of nuts, you know I don't eat fruit as snacks anymore But I eat fruit as a meal cuz I'll eat like a banana and like an orange as breakfast.

657
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:56,330
Speaker 0: Banana alone is not breakfast.

658
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:58,750
Speaker 0: I got to cut up that banana and put it in a Rice Krispie to make it break.

659
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:04,962
Speaker 1: So for most of my life, I just either didn't eat breakfast or I'd like especially in college Like I pretty much would eat a I a tree.

660
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,230
Speaker 0: This is the most best food.

661
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:12,250
Speaker 1: No I treated lunch like dinner and I'd eat a giant lunch and a small dinner and I'd skip breakfast for a long time.

662
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:15,310
Speaker 1: I only started eating breakfast again very recently.

663
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:24,057
Speaker 0: other snacks I eat are like these days is like I'll get a bowl put some salsa in it and get the chips and Just eat until I want to stop.

664
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:27,810
Speaker 0: but my pro technique is I put sour cream in that bowl of salsa.

665
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:29,208
Speaker 0: That's my pro technique.

666
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:30,994
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

667
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:31,918
Speaker 1: So nowadays.

668
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:37,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I want to usually when I snack it's either I'm desperately hungry between geek nights and eating dinner.

669
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:41,754
Speaker 1: So I'll go eat like a handful of peanuts or something Like.

670
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:43,965
Speaker 1: I'll just go open the kid like whatever crackers are open.

671
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:44,789
Speaker 1: I'll just eat some of them.

672
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,730
Speaker 1: but when I actually snack now, there's the only kind of snacks I have that aren't like a random banana are?

673
00:42:50,971 --> 00:43:00,887
Speaker 1: I'll get out like a small collection of cheeses and meats and cut like a small Charcuterie kind of plate and I'll eat that like some olives and some cheese and some crackers like.

674
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:04,629
Speaker 1: I'll prepare it Like it's a meal and then I'll eat it from a little plate.

675
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:09,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the thing is like, you know, I don't eat like Prepackaged snacks anymore.

676
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:18,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are times when like some snacks would get into my house I would buy them or whatever and then if I had a like a box of snack It sort of fell into two categories.

677
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,740
Speaker 0: right category one.

678
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,987
Speaker 0: I forgot about it and didn't eat it like.

679
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:24,996
Speaker 1: oh no What's this bag of tidbits?

680
00:43:25,156 --> 00:43:26,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

681
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:27,846
Speaker 0: how did what's this in my cabinet?

682
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:28,308
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

683
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:28,930
Speaker 0: How old is this?

684
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:36,989
Speaker 0: Or the category of like I would buy a bag of golden Oreo and every day I would eat two or three golden Oreo.

685
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:39,990
Speaker 0: Usually is dessert though, but something sugary like that.

686
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,710
Speaker 0: But you know just like once a day eat one serving of the thing until it's gone.

687
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:55,295
Speaker 1: I guess what's interesting is that most of the sweet snacks that I ate through high school and Into college until I stopped and that I don't eat now Basically just garbage.

688
00:43:55,516 --> 00:44:05,070
Speaker 1: Yep, like the good like their garbage to the point that I feel vaguely sick like zebra cakes Disgusting and yet I would eat two to five of them a day in high school.

689
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:06,986
Speaker 0: I mean that's really been the.

690
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,376
Speaker 0: you know The key is like I don't.

691
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:10,259
Speaker 0: I just don't.

692
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,450
Speaker 0: I eat the meals of the day and I don't eat a lot of other food.

693
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:17,910
Speaker 0: I haven't even bought fire yogurt and like many many moons mostly cuz it hasn't been on sale.

694
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,874
Speaker 0: They buy it was on sale.

695
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:28,065
Speaker 1: So I think part of that is that while I am still hyperactive like you bike a lot I ain't run all the time, but I'm not also growing like I was in high school

696
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:28,787
Speaker 0: obviously,

697
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:40,368
Speaker 1: but to a Lot of the garbage I ate was sort of like the cheap garbage and now that I have some money I just pretty much always eat really high quality food.

698
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,702
Speaker 1: and Once that happened, I find it very difficult to eat.

699
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:48,630
Speaker 1: like when I say the high quality versus low quality I don't mean like cheap food is not bad.

700
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:59,610
Speaker 1: There's really good cheap food but like Like the food you would buy in the grocery store For like kids to snack on like zebra cakes and things like that are just so disgusting to me that I cannot eat them anymore.

701
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:07,341
Speaker 0: It's like I just you know by if I have a food in the house in the apartment and it's noticeable It's not hiding somewhere like the back of the fridge and I see it.

702
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,270
Speaker 0: then I'll eat the one serving a day.

703
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:12,430
Speaker 0: So I just don't put that kind of food in the house, right?

704
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,691
Speaker 0: And it's.

705
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:16,010
Speaker 0: but you know, it helps a lot is actually the blue apron like food delivery?

706
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:20,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you don't go to the grocery store, you don't see those things.

707
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:21,793
Speaker 0: So you don't buy them So you don't need them.

708
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:27,970
Speaker 1: when I go grocery shopping It's not wander around the grocery store and grab all the shit I want.

709
00:45:28,151 --> 00:45:30,785
Speaker 1: It's what do I need to cook the meals for the next few weeks?

710
00:45:30,846 --> 00:45:31,449
Speaker 1: All right, I need.

711
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,480
Speaker 0: yeah I have a recipe and I get the ingredients for that recipe.

712
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:37,330
Speaker 0: I don't buy anything else in the grocery store.

713
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't browse fresh right?

714
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:44,137
Speaker 1: I literally type like white onion because I need white onions and then I click buy then I type Dandelion.

715
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:46,333
Speaker 0: so these things aren't in my house They're not there.

716
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,246
Speaker 0: so I don't eat them even though I might and I might want to.

717
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:52,543
Speaker 1: it doesn't happen And that might be part of why we're not.

718
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:53,749
Speaker 0: that I don't know.

719
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,203
Speaker 0: But I've never been fat even when I was eating those new.

720
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,330
Speaker 0: even I was eating many ring things.

721
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:58,514
Speaker 0: That is one thing.

722
00:45:58,595 --> 00:46:07,050
Speaker 1: cuz you ate that crap when you weren't that active like before you started biking a lot But I ate that crap and I was crazy active and neither like we didn't either one of us really gained.

723
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,763
Speaker 0: Anyway, DNA matters a lot.

724
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:20,153
Speaker 1: Yeah but Most the list of snacks that I ate as a kid That I find disgusting today is so expensive like Doritos Cheez-its.

725
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:22,923
Speaker 1: Well, I used to eat Cheetos.

726
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:23,526
Speaker 0: Yes.

727
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:24,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't I never eat.

728
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:30,150
Speaker 1: Pour like a quarter of a bag of Cheetos into a bowl and eat them all while I play video games.

729
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:31,334
Speaker 0: See my whole life.

730
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:35,389
Speaker 0: I never ate anything with what I call flavor powder, right?

731
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:35,710
Speaker 1: I did.

732
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:40,270
Speaker 1: I love the shit out of Oreos in middle school Oreos Doritos in middle school, right?

733
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:46,670
Speaker 0: So for example, like when I was talking about getting a corn chip with salsa I get a corn chip that has nothing on it, but corn and salt pretty much.

734
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:51,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you go to the potato chip aisle, it's like I'll get regular potato chip.

735
00:46:52,206 --> 00:46:53,670
Speaker 0: I'll get roughly potato chip.

736
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:56,520
Speaker 0: I'll get a darker russet potato chip.

737
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,186
Speaker 0: It's made with a or kettle chip.

738
00:46:58,306 --> 00:46:59,210
Speaker 0: Those are all just fine.

739
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,884
Speaker 1: I'll go one step further and sometimes I'll get like vinegar and sea salt.

740
00:47:02,964 --> 00:47:03,667
Speaker 1: No, that's okay.

741
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:04,590
Speaker 0: No, we'll not do that.

742
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,339
Speaker 0: No, I don't do any.

743
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:14,327
Speaker 0: as soon as it's like barbecue chip or The chips that have powder on them are disgusting right but this that's the.

744
00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:15,089
Speaker 0: I don't get Vin.

745
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:17,259
Speaker 0: Nope I don't get any but flavored but not.

746
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:19,430
Speaker 1: it's not like it's synthetic vinegar.

747
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:26,910
Speaker 0: All Doritos are like these basically tasteless chips that are covered in like this powder of flavor and it's like.

748
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:27,333
Speaker 0: no I don't eat.

749
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:28,601
Speaker 0: I don't cheese balls.

750
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:28,883
Speaker 0: Nope.

751
00:47:28,924 --> 00:47:32,945
Speaker 0: Don't eat cheese balls Combos those pretzels with the poison in the middle.

752
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:37,502
Speaker 1: So when I was So I would eat like I had the snacks I would eat.

753
00:47:37,843 --> 00:47:41,844
Speaker 0: but most of the memory in those my whole life They're that I knew in middle school.

754
00:47:41,884 --> 00:47:46,990
Speaker 1: in high school Like everyone else like one they get lunch from the school cafeteria, which I never did cuz that shit was disgusting.

755
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:53,190
Speaker 0: I would only Occasionally buy just a french fry in the school cafeteria if I had some money because they actually made a good fry.

756
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:57,130
Speaker 1: Like I got the burger for my high school once and I can't imagine eating that as a human be.

757
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,439
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I never ate the burger from the high school is disgusting but Everyone in my middle school in high school.

758
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,789
Speaker 1: They eat like combos and the slush puppies.

759
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:15,461
Speaker 1: yeah, and That shit always looked disgusting and felt disgusting and I remember the one time I put like a combo in my mouth and it Disgusting.

760
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:20,490
Speaker 0: no Whenever I brought my lunch, mostly my mom would make a lunch and put it in a baggie.

761
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:37,470
Speaker 1: Oh, there was a definite turning point in my life when my mom was like you can make your own lunch and for about four years I packed a Bag of garbage every day took it to school ate it all before first period And then went out to Arby's and bought lunch.

762
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:49,733
Speaker 0: I had to usually one or two sandwiches peanut butter and jelly or salami or whatever and then some snack action in there right and then at lunch I would open it and eat all of it and then I'd only get like a french fry if I Was still hungry.

763
00:48:49,773 --> 00:48:51,620
Speaker 0: and then actually in high school.

764
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,765
Speaker 0: There was a there was a period.

765
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:55,277
Speaker 0: they had this little candy store That would open during lunch.

766
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:56,343
Speaker 1: Oh, we had one of those.

767
00:48:56,464 --> 00:48:57,209
Speaker 1: the students ran it.

768
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:04,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much sort of I would go in there and I would buy something that was new at the time Which is mini M&Ms.

769
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:14,066
Speaker 0: It was this plastic tube Full of tiny tiny M&Ms and you'd open up the tube and just dump the whole tube of M&Ms in your mouth All at once like a shot.

770
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:18,749
Speaker 0: I Collected every single one of those tubes at a plastic bag full of tubes.

771
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:25,410
Speaker 0: I don't know if I still have it somewhere if I got thrown out But I had those tubes from all those mini M&Ms I ate.

772
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:32,950
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess I don't know if it's just that our lifestyle changed or that we have money.

773
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:40,965
Speaker 1: But when I snack nowadays, I pretty much like I said, I only make like I cry making a snack for myself I treat it the same way as cooking a meal.

774
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:44,481
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm If you're I'm just gonna say I'm not a doctor.

775
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:45,404
Speaker 0: do not take Scott's.

776
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:46,950
Speaker 0: non doctor non science.

777
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,057
Speaker 0: They say don't snack non science.

778
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:53,570
Speaker 1: diet advice because I've read science stuff that says if you just don't snack You are better off.

779
00:49:54,092 --> 00:50:04,085
Speaker 0: If you are someone who's doing some weird fad diet nonsense, or you're thinking about it or whatever Try doing the diet of Scott, which is a eat when you're hungry.

780
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:06,914
Speaker 0: B. Don't eat when you're not hungry All the time.

781
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:12,170
Speaker 1: I mean you're just gonna have to suffer and I'm gonna admit I am literally hungry all the time.

782
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:12,994
Speaker 0: I'm hungry right now.

783
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:15,890
Speaker 0: I'm hungry right now, but I'm gonna go home and reheat my food and eat it.

784
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,082
Speaker 0: But yeah, just don't eat a snack or a dessert.

785
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,110
Speaker 0: only eat the three meals a day and that's it.

786
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,099
Speaker 0: They could be big meals, but just don't eat anything else.

787
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,426
Speaker 1: Well, don't eat bags of garbage.

788
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:27,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't eat feed bags.

789
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,229
Speaker 0: Don't need to don't eat too many ring things every day.

790
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,255
Speaker 1: But at the same time if doodads if I found a box of doodads that was somehow not expired I would probably eat them.

791
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:35,980
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

792
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,920
Speaker 0: But at the same time I I used to eat Nilla wafers.

793
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,363
Speaker 0: Those are good.

794
00:50:40,645 --> 00:50:41,310
Speaker 1: Those are okay.

795
00:50:41,554 --> 00:50:42,268
Speaker 0: I like Nilla wafer.

796
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:46,350
Speaker 0: The way to eat Nilla wafer is I put it in my mouth and suck on it a little bit.

797
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:50,984
Speaker 0: I would suck on it a whole bunch to drain it of all sugar and then eat it.

798
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:54,695
Speaker 1: I would do that with the Precursor to Cheez-Its.

799
00:50:55,497 --> 00:50:59,430
Speaker 0: It's weird that like these foods have a particular way you to eat them.

800
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:06,227
Speaker 1: That's why I fell down the fucking stairs Broke my neck because I was working out the way to particularly eat the combination of different.

801
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:08,515
Speaker 0: the way I eat the fire Yogurt is like I don't.

802
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:12,090
Speaker 0: some people I guess flip over the fruit and squeeze it onto the right.

803
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:13,935
Speaker 0: No, I do is?

804
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:21,805
Speaker 0: I take I spoon some yogurt and then I spoon a tiny amount of fruit and I try to get Fruit into every single spoon and measure it exactly right.

805
00:51:21,865 --> 00:51:22,106
Speaker 1: Yep.

806
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:28,069
Speaker 0: Yeah With the fruit on the bottom yogurt, I would just stir it up real good.

807
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:38,696
Speaker 1: When I make myself like a little charcuterie plate of some kind I will literally like pick a particular cracker and take like the piece of salami and one of the pimento olives and then I'll eat all of those together.

808
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:43,938
Speaker 1: and I like craft every one of the like Things that I put into my mouth one by one.

809
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:48,314
Speaker 0: if I spread the cheese onto the cracker with the red stick each cracker needs The perfect coating.

810
00:51:48,374 --> 00:51:48,595
Speaker 0: Yep.

811
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:54,530
Speaker 0: No, I would put and then all the left all the leftover cheese I scoop with the red stick and put directly in my mouth.

812
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:57,629
Speaker 0: So I scooped out with my tongue and so there is until there is none left.

813
00:51:57,891 --> 00:51:59,950
Speaker 1: I would throw the red stick away after I had spread the cheese.

814
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:01,769
Speaker 1: I would just lick the inside of that thing out.

815
00:52:02,312 --> 00:52:03,799
Speaker 0: I would I do if I spread some.

816
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:11,370
Speaker 0: if I use a knife to like make a peanut butter the jelly sandwich I spread the peanut butter then I lick the knife clean then I spread the jelly then I lick the knife clean.

817
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,803
Speaker 0: You might say oh my god, you licked a knife.

818
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:13,550
Speaker 0: They went in the jelly.

819
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:15,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm the only one eating that jelly.

820
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:15,977
Speaker 0: So whatever.

821
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:17,842
Speaker 0: No one else is eating my jelly.

822
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:22,615
Speaker 1: I would not do that Even if I was the only one.

823
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:29,660
Speaker 0: if I am sharing the peanut butter and jelly with other people I get my own plastic disposable knife to lick and don't use the knife everyone else is using.

824
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:32,690
Speaker 0: so I am respectful of other people's.

825
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:36,014
Speaker 0: You know not getting my spit in their jelly So interesting.

826
00:52:36,034 --> 00:52:38,126
Speaker 1: when I think about it, I don't consider cook, but I like to like.

827
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:38,930
Speaker 0: I like to lick the knife.

828
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,267
Speaker 1: But I eat cookies like all the time cookies or snacks, but unless after dinner.

829
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:42,790
Speaker 0: that is dessert.

830
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:44,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I just eat cookies all the time.

831
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:45,770
Speaker 1: Like if there's cookies I eat them.

832
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:48,550
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but the thing is if there's cookies I feel food aggressive.

833
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,610
Speaker 0: But the only time there are cookies is packs.

834
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:56,470
Speaker 0: If I buy a bag of cookies, which I haven't done in forever or if I bake cookies, right?

835
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,155
Speaker 0: There aren't cookies around that often.

836
00:52:58,196 --> 00:53:02,170
Speaker 0: So when they are around I'll eat one or two or three or four.

837
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:02,692
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

838
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:08,890
Speaker 0: The difference is when I heard snack period when I eat a bunch of cookies like the most cookies I'll eat like let's say there's a bucket of cookies.

839
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:18,540
Speaker 0: I'll eat one time between lunch and dinner three or four cookies And then if I am hungry after dinner for dessert three or four cookies And that is the most cookie.

840
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:19,690
Speaker 0: I will eat this maximum.

841
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:28,810
Speaker 1: But that is why like I eat a lot of cookies Compared to the amount of cookies I buy but I basically only buy or make like nice fancy cookies.

842
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,678
Speaker 1: I basically don't eat things like I don't know.

843
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:33,329
Speaker 0: you don't buy the goods every time I kind of mix it up.

844
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:36,710
Speaker 1: Those shortbread cookies for fresh direct are real real goddamn good.

845
00:53:37,432 --> 00:53:44,110
Speaker 1: And as I've gotten older, I've come to particularly appreciate the simple the humble sugar cookie and the simple shortbread cookie.

846
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:45,649
Speaker 1: Those might be my favorite kinds of cookies.

847
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:54,811
Speaker 1: But when I think of snack, I pretty much always think of savory things vaguely in the realm of pretzels peanuts Chex mix type stuff Mm-hmm.

848
00:53:55,333 --> 00:54:04,105
Speaker 0: There is the magic mix which when I if I have a whole but usually I'll make the magic mix because I need it For some you know thing to take it somewhere like biking or whatever, but I treat that.

849
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:05,390
Speaker 1: I treat that like fuel.

850
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,550
Speaker 1: I don't think of it as a snack.

851
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,369
Speaker 1: I think of it as I am on a long run and I need to eat something halfway through it.

852
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:15,410
Speaker 0: But if I happen to have a I make them the magic mix in a like a gallon ziplock bag.

853
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:24,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's a ton of it when I make it and if I have it in the fridge and I'm hungry between meals I'll go in there take the whole bag out and just eat a few fistfuls of it till I don't want anymore.

854
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:31,063
Speaker 1: So I realized the thing I was talking about where as a kid I would be very weirdly particular about how I combine my snacks.

855
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:37,554
Speaker 1: I realized I do still do that because When I went when I do the like standing in the kitchen I needed II.

856
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:40,390
Speaker 1: I need to eat a handful of something because it's gonna take me a while to cook dinner.

857
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:47,824
Speaker 1: my go-to is to eat like Some croutons and then some peanuts and stop eating the croutons.

858
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:49,189
Speaker 0: So croutons are for salad only.

859
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:50,953
Speaker 1: I Actually will put.

860
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:56,730
Speaker 1: I'll bite into the croutons first and then I'll put some peanuts in my mouth and then I'll chew them up together.

861
00:54:56,974 --> 00:54:57,443
Speaker 0: What the hell?

862
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,603
Speaker 1: That is a better experience than the croutons.

863
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:03,110
Speaker 0: peanut and crouton do not go together.

864
00:55:03,912 --> 00:55:10,229
Speaker 1: I think if pop culture had put croutons in checks mix tile style snack mixes you would have no problem with this.

865
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:12,270
Speaker 0: No, I would have a huge problem with that.

866
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,493
Speaker 1: But do you have a problem with snack mixes?

867
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:24,839
Speaker 1: the ones that are like peanut checks pretzel stick cheese thing maybe a raisin cheese cheese stick Like a tidbit What you don't remember.

868
00:55:24,879 --> 00:55:26,128
Speaker 1: what's in like checks mix do ya?

869
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,037
Speaker 1: This checks like this kind of raisin.

870
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:30,702
Speaker 0: I know you hate raisin.

871
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:32,267
Speaker 1: I do not hate raisin.

872
00:55:32,307 --> 00:55:33,070
Speaker 0: I thought you hated raisin.

873
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:34,097
Speaker 1: I like raisins fine.

874
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,790
Speaker 0: Pretty sure you change your mind on raisin.

875
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:41,590
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of eating a fistful of raisins by themselves, but I like raisins like in certain other things.

876
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:43,499
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm golden raisins in.

877
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:44,102
Speaker 0: that reminds me.

878
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:45,006
Speaker 0: I got grapes in the fridge.

879
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:45,710
Speaker 0: I'm gonna eat tonight.

880
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:47,949
Speaker 1: Oh, I got some blueberries, but they're kind of sour.

881
00:55:48,506 --> 00:55:51,702
Speaker 0: No my grapes are good blueberries not great that I'm gonna go to the grocery store.

882
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:55,884
Speaker 0: if you see some grapes eat one grape to See how any good and if they're good then buy bad grapes.

883
00:55:56,226 --> 00:55:58,638
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid I would occasionally peel my grapes and then eat them.

884
00:55:58,839 --> 00:55:59,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, I peel.

885
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:05,384
Speaker 0: Oh if I eat a grape I would peel it and eat the skin and then I would peel it in my mouth.

886
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:09,561
Speaker 0: until so then in my mouth is a peeled Grape, I'd eat the skin and but all in my mouth.

887
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:10,807
Speaker 1: I wouldn't know if I peeled grapes.

888
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:11,370
Speaker 1: I ate the skin.

889
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:11,733
Speaker 1: I'm not.

890
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:12,278
Speaker 1: so I'm not like.

891
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:15,636
Speaker 1: not like the person who cuts the Whole grape in my mouth.

892
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:19,348
Speaker 0: eat the skin in my mouth and then eat the grape in my mouth.

893
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:20,010
