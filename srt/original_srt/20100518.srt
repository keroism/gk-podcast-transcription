1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,265
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 18th.

2
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:12,007
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:18,880
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight a genre at which we suck ass real time strategy games.

4
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,457
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,467
Speaker 0: So I'm sitting at work today.

6
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,712
Speaker 0: You know doing my work thing.

7
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:30,756
Speaker 0: It's getting around lunchtime.

8
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:36,356
Speaker 0: I'm kind of hungry and The front desk calls and says there's someone here with the package for me.

9
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:37,842
Speaker 0: alrighty I don't.

10
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:38,747
Speaker 0: I don't know what this is.

11
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,967
Speaker 0: I haven't ordered anything and I didn't recognize the name They said from it.

12
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:49,023
Speaker 0: so I go up there And it's a pizza delivery guy who has three like gigantic pizzas from a really expensive nice place And he says they're for me.

13
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:49,746
Speaker 0: Well.

14
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,253
Speaker 0: He said they're for a name.

15
00:00:51,293 --> 00:01:02,994
Speaker 0: That is very similar to mine Uh-huh, but at the same time he had my extension like he knew my phone number at work And it was delivered to our office with the right address from some guy.

16
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:04,580
Speaker 0: I have no idea who it is.

17
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:07,713
Speaker 0: I even like went through my outlook stuff and old business cards.

18
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:07,954
Speaker 0: I could.

19
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,059
Speaker 0: I have no idea who this is.

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:20,030
Speaker 0: I'm assuming it's some vendor trying to get you know into my good side, but for the life of me It's kind of like that those artist alley people who had little ghosties And we forgot who they were but we remembered the ghostie.

21
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the same thing.

22
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:23,855
Speaker 0: someone got me a really nice pizza but I have no idea who they are.

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,736
Speaker 0: but I'm still not convinced that it wasn't just poison.

24
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:30,325
Speaker 0: pizza Got trouble yawning.

25
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:31,188
Speaker 1: I yawned again.

26
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,140
Speaker 0: Yeah story was that boring no mystery random pizza.

27
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,291
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's probably a reasonable explanation for it.

28
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,640
Speaker 0: or someone's trying to get me pizza?

29
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:41,500
Speaker 1: Maybe there wasn't a reasonable explanation.

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,156
Speaker 1: Maybe it was like some accident or some hackers or a computer error in your favor.

31
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:47,100
Speaker 1: collect three pizzas.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never considered the idea.

33
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,139
Speaker 1: do not do not pass go.

34
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:54,260
Speaker 0: I never thought of like hacking Grubhub to just have them send me food.

35
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I mean think about right you Chipotle.

36
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:58,275
Speaker 1: you can pay with the credit card online.

37
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,042
Speaker 1: walk into the Chipotle and get food Right.

38
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:03,320
Speaker 1: so you don't even need to hack Chipotle to put in fake orders.

39
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:05,851
Speaker 1: You can just figure out what orders are in there.

40
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:10,485
Speaker 1: go in say yeah This should be a burrito here for Joe And you know that Joe ordered one.

41
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:13,738
Speaker 1: you get there before Joe and you take his burrito and no one ever checks.

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,360
Speaker 0: nope In fact the thing is if I were homeless what I would do is you know Starbucks.

43
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,130
Speaker 0: There's always that a counter and everyone's waiting for the drink.

44
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,020
Speaker 0: No one really pays attention.

45
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:27,939
Speaker 0: You could pretty much just walk up stand there You know kind of a little bit away, and then they're like got a tall double frappe aca aca

46
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:29,462
Speaker 1: That's me

47
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,565
Speaker 0: yep, just like

48
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:37,959
Speaker 1: yep, and then someone else goes hey, I ordered a double what the weather would do with it and they go oh Okay, and they make another one for you.

49
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:42,103
Speaker 0: They pretty much do you know how many times they've given me a free drink just because they're like yeah You waited too long.

50
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,891
Speaker 0: They give me a little coupon for a free Starbucks.

51
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, they like bend over back.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,466
Speaker 1: I don't care cuz you're already paying like 500%.

53
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,156
Speaker 1: It's like in the movie theater gave out a free popcorn.

54
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:54,410
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, thanks That's more per ounce.

55
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:55,919
Speaker 0: we're talking gold Jerry.

56
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:04,123
Speaker 1: The other thing is we just read about that Pandora Pandora Panera.

57
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:08,080
Speaker 1: I'm sort of box the Panera dude Pandora's bread.

58
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:15,340
Speaker 0: We should make a Pandora that you go in and they give you different kinds of bread that they think you'll like.

59
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:16,766
Speaker 1: What is in this box?

60
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:17,007
Speaker 1: Oh?

61
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,659
Speaker 1: No you have leashed upon us the evil.

62
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:22,287
Speaker 1: Possibly put it back in the box.

63
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:25,880
Speaker 1: It is soup in a bread bowl with an apple next.

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,360
Speaker 0: That's in fact one of the most important things the world has ever invented.

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,282
Speaker 1: Bowl.

66
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:31,145
Speaker 1: they started these.

67
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:31,748
Speaker 1: nonprofit.

68
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,340
Speaker 1: Panera is where you can get anything and you pay what you want.

69
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:38,908
Speaker 1: So it's like I would just pay a dollar every time I would be like yeah Give me a whole lunch dollar.

70
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:43,076
Speaker 0: so you know you're not thinking outside the box The box.

71
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,780
Speaker 0: If I went to that Panera, maybe I should go to that Panera.

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,620
Speaker 0: I would order everything in everything in the store and say I want everything I take it all with me in a big sack.

73
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,679
Speaker 0: Maybe a bunch of sacks may look at someone to help me.

74
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:57,072
Speaker 1: I think they might say no to that would they though?

75
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:04,674
Speaker 0: because as soon as they try to stop me I'll say well I'm going to give this to a homeless person, and I plan to pay exactly what I want for it.

76
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:10,043
Speaker 0: There's a dollar zero one penny One penny.

77
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:13,938
Speaker 0: you realize you know I take my pants off every day when I get home and money just have to do.

78
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:18,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, how much more money falls out of my pockets?

79
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:20,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, I put that money in a jar.

80
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, the jars full so I can then use it.

81
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,407
Speaker 0: Actually, Emily's been yelling at me.

82
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:26,835
Speaker 0: She wants me to go cash in the jar.

83
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:27,660
Speaker 1: Go cash it in.

84
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,510
Speaker 0: We actually the movers moved it here.

85
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,319
Speaker 0: It was too big for me to just carry on the train.

86
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,087
Speaker 1: All right, that's enough of that.

87
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:40,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, well there is one more important bit of you know Meta kind of open event news for those of you who are unaware.

88
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,277
Speaker 0: I actually bought an Xbox kind of.

89
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:44,900
Speaker 0: basically I bought a Street Fighter 4 machine.

90
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:49,680
Speaker 1: You got more games for it than I do actually yeah, because the Xbox came with two games.

91
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,303
Speaker 0: So I have a time.

92
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:51,369
Speaker 0: mine didn't really game is.

93
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,450
Speaker 1: my came with a rebate, so I basically Yeah, it's funny.

94
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,100
Speaker 1: I paid less money, but you got free game.

95
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:01,640
Speaker 0: I paid the actual MSRP for the elite, but then I got like Grand Theft Auto not Grand Theft Auto.

96
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,584
Speaker 0: I got like.

97
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:04,432
Speaker 0: I think for is this something?

98
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,160
Speaker 0: and I have some halo game.

99
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,979
Speaker 0: I haven't even opened the boxes for those yet.

100
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:15,548
Speaker 0: yeah, I basically brought it home turn it on put in Street Fighter plugged in my Street Fighter stick and Preceded to realize what do you do?

101
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:15,930
Speaker 0: suck?

102
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,674
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

103
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:17,639
Speaker 1: You're bored of Street Fighter ah?

104
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,827
Speaker 1: regret regret spending so much money.

105
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,719
Speaker 0: use it as an replace the Roku box.

106
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:27,875
Speaker 1: I Guess what the Roku actually does more than yeah, I know.

107
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it yet.

108
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:50,800
Speaker 0: I figure I will play enough games with the listeners And you know basically it's a way for me to interface with all the people and that whole gaming side of the world that I've basically ignored Because you know you and I are both PC gamers primarily like that's where our gaming at least that's where our video gaming is and The Wii is only great when you have four people around reliably

109
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:55,140
Speaker 1: Listen to an early geek nights where it's just like PC gaming is dead.

110
00:05:56,961 --> 00:06:01,590
Speaker 1: Nintendo Wii Nintendo DS Fuck the Xbox like the ps3.

111
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,899
Speaker 0: the thing is back then fuck the Xbox.

112
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 0: You know what did?

113
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,360
Speaker 0: the Street Fighter 4 is why I bought the Xbox and any other games.

114
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,072
Speaker 1: Was that a long time ago?

115
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:15,022
Speaker 0: super Street Fighter 4?

116
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:26,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of that just got it to interface with that whole other community And I guess as at least a pretend journalist in the video game world I need to at least have a ps3 or an Xbox.

117
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,106
Speaker 0: I guess so anyway plus It's not like it cost that much money.

118
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:33,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, my laptop is in Kentucky.

119
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:38,920
Speaker 1: it says it's like warehoused until like someone checks it out, which I assume means customer customs.

120
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,951
Speaker 0: But didn't it come in through like Alaska.

121
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:42,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't do Alaska.

122
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,580
Speaker 1: first They didn't check it in Alaska even though it came from China.

123
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,749
Speaker 0: Well, maybe it came in and went out and then the relax is like oh shit I think that was from China.

124
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:49,616
Speaker 0: They emailed Kentucky.

125
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:56,978
Speaker 1: They're like hey The exact text says this shipment is warehoused until it is released by clearing agency, huh?

126
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,629
Speaker 0: All right, that's interesting.

127
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,176
Speaker 0: maybe they accidentally sent you one of the weed laptops.

128
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:12,580
Speaker 1: it says, you know the status exception Ship to New York shipped on the 14th product world ease.

129
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,516
Speaker 1: Huh service expedited special instructions.

130
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:20,488
Speaker 0: signature acquired Alright, but video games.

131
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:24,960
Speaker 1: Okay video game video game news kind of this isn't a big news.

132
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,467
Speaker 1: There's not really much to say about it.

133
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:29,220
Speaker 1: But remember we went to the New York Tokyo Music Festival a long time ago.

134
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:35,179
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the whole Memory of that night just flooded back into my head.

135
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:44,880
Speaker 1: But anyway, the New York Tokyo website basically I realized is a good place to like learn about events that are New York Tokyo related usually in New York relating to Tokyo.

136
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:50,178
Speaker 0: So that website's still there because I thought the festival like died not long after we wake a lot more going.

137
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:50,760
Speaker 1: it wasn't?

138
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,410
Speaker 1: You know, New York, Tokyo is an organization.

139
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,880
Speaker 1: The music festival is just one event.

140
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:58,000
Speaker 0: I think they tried to do it again the next year and we didn't go and then that's probably why they cancelled it.

141
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:00,720
Speaker 1: Anyway, the thing is they do lots of other stuff, right?

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,861
Speaker 1: Like they have a game night where they play Street Fighter 4 and such and I think I might cause money and be 21 plus I'm

143
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,852
Speaker 0: not going to a game night plus people play Street Fighter 4 plus it'd be

144
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:12,966
Speaker 1: all Asians and we would have no chance Like yeah, okay.

145
00:08:12,986 --> 00:08:14,515
Speaker 1: Let's play perfect.

146
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:15,139
Speaker 1: Not me.

147
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:24,593
Speaker 0: No I think I would do just fine because I would consider it against people who are actually good at Street Fighter 4. if I get so much as a jab in I consider it that I want.

148
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,239
Speaker 0: you can get a jab then I won.

149
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:30,277
Speaker 1: as far As I'm concerned any moron can get a jab if you just jab like crazy.

150
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:30,800
Speaker 1: You're gonna hit.

151
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,510
Speaker 0: I wouldn't plan online there.

152
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,381
Speaker 0: There's some people not a jab Really?

153
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:39,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, t-hawk is like the heat just fucks me up right now.

154
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:44,039
Speaker 1: You know, it's so easy to beat I know but I'm not good at this game when you just got a jab him like crazy.

155
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was trying to do that.

156
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:48,800
Speaker 0: I'm working on my Ken my Vega my doll seam and my guile.

157
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,680
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got to pick just one other way to learn because there's so many subtleties.

158
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,200
Speaker 1: You got to pick just one guy that you can learn all the subtleties.

159
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,960
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're gonna not look you're not gonna learn anyone deep enough to actually be good.

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,789
Speaker 1: Well, basically, I'm I got to pick one of those four, but you do have to play Everyone at least a little bit.

161
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:06,695
Speaker 1: so, you know what they got.

162
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,799
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean basically of those four.

163
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,687
Speaker 0: I'm playing them all like through the single player and a little bit online to figure out which of the four is going to be My go-to guy like my number one guy.

164
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:19,400
Speaker 0: cuz I'll seem not cutting it like you did in Super Street Fighter 2.

165
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,584
Speaker 1: He was pretty strong.

166
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,676
Speaker 1: Yes, but Seth is pretty is very dalsim ish.

167
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:24,860
Speaker 0: They'll seem strong.

168
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,101
Speaker 0: It's just.

169
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,045
Speaker 0: it doesn't suit my.

170
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:26,668
Speaker 0: maybe it's just cuz.

171
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:32,920
Speaker 0: I've been corrupted by like Soul Calibers and all the other games I played for so long, but the style I got to use with dalsim does not jive.

172
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,594
Speaker 1: I'm much more style of anyone you got to use is nothing like Soul Calibur.

173
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,220
Speaker 0: No, I'm not saying it's like Soul Calibur.

174
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,120
Speaker 0: I'm saying just it feels weird to me.

175
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,320
Speaker 0: I guess I need the guys with like charging moves more so than I need guys with like tech moves.

176
00:09:44,581 --> 00:10:01,305
Speaker 1: Anyway, so on their website this little announcement here that says UT X MGS colon PW which translates to Uniqlo UT t-shirt program Uniqlo t-shirt.

177
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,209
Speaker 1: What are you so excited?

178
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,595
Speaker 1: You're getting excited at the wrong part.

179
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:04,620
Speaker 0: I like Uniqlo t-shirts.

180
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,367

Speaker 1: It says Kojima will be at Uniqlo on June 11th.

183
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:14,856
Speaker 1: That's it.

184
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:17,282
Speaker 0: Whoa That's interesting.

185
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:17,724
Speaker 1: That's it.

186
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,792
Speaker 1: Maybe I've got my eyes.

187
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,136
Speaker 1: I just be like, hey coach.

Speaker 0: No, you're what I'll give it to me.

191
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,416
Speaker 1: Like he'd be like I didn't make that.

192
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:27,180
Speaker 1: What is this?

193
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,590
Speaker 0: What I would say to him is I would present it to him and say you could either sign this or destroy it in front Of my eyes and I'll be happy with either one.

194
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,519
Speaker 0: I Apologize on behalf of my nation for this.

195
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:45,790
Speaker 1: The point is you know, oh no the Kojima have started to kind of I go and be like, hey, yeah your games I don't like them.

196
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,143
Speaker 0: No, you know what.

197
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:50,408
Speaker 0: this is a perfect opportunity.

198
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:53,920
Speaker 0: ask him if he actually in fact is Masamune Shiro.

199
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:57,948
Speaker 1: Hey, do you know Masamune Shiro?

200
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:58,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, are you him?

201
00:10:59,013 --> 00:10:59,636
Speaker 0: There's a chance.

202
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,204
Speaker 0: they're the same person I don't know.

203
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,592
Speaker 1: He can't I don't think coach him.

204
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:03,175
Speaker 1: I can draw.

205
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,411
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, but he can crazy.

206
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,060
Speaker 1: they can take him both crazy.

207
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:10,560
Speaker 1: They're equal in the crazy town.

208
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,219
Speaker 0: So, you know all that news about how Farmville is like the biggest game at.

209
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,594
Speaker 0: well I gotta qualify this because I don't think it's actually a game.

210
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:18,940
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into that.

211
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,229
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about Farmville the game.

212
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:32,095
Speaker 0: I want to talk about all the money meta around Farmville because Farmville has been making the news like the mainstream news for being gigantic like Millions and millions and millions and millions of players like the biggest game ever.

213
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:38,114
Speaker 1: Yeah gaming gaming It's one of those situations where they're counting the same way that like second life is counting.

214
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:41,163
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, okay active people Whatever BS.

215
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,908
Speaker 1: It's one person with 20 accounts.

216
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:43,770
Speaker 1: You're gonna shit.

217
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:51,799
Speaker 0: and all the news so far is primarily talked about how big the game Is now it's only getting bigger and how everyone's mom is playing it and my mom's playing it.

218
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:55,811
Speaker 0: It looks like there's a strange trend as of about a month ago.

219
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:56,914
Speaker 0: They claim here.

220
00:11:56,994 --> 00:12:01,286
Speaker 0: I'll read from the Kotaku article Zinga's losing subscribers, whatever.

221
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:05,656
Speaker 0: two weeks ago Zinga lost 3.1 million active users across all their games.

222
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:07,844
Speaker 0: last week alone They lost 4.2 million.

223
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:07,985
Speaker 0: Yep.

224
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:11,890
Speaker 1: I Think is they have.

225
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,399
Speaker 1: they have so many millions.

226
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:17,852
Speaker 0: Well, so many millions of accounts that have ever been touched by anyone.

227
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:20,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so what's going on?

228
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,180
Speaker 0: Why are all their games suddenly collapsing?

229
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:29,120
Speaker 0: Well, it turns out that the only people who play these games are people who do it because they're Pavlovian.

230
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,813
Speaker 0: They they play because they're spammed into playing.

231
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:34,560
Speaker 0: They don't actually like these games.

232
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:39,176
Speaker 0: They play because they get a notification that says hey farm something mafia something.

233
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,500
Speaker 0: click here to make the thing happen.

234
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,143
Speaker 1: Yeah, and people?

235
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:45,080
Speaker 1: I used to think that the notifications in those games were just to get you into them.

236
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:49,500
Speaker 1: It would be like, you know You would go into Facebook and all you'd see all your friends would be like farm farm farm.

237
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,180
Speaker 1: So then you would sign up for the farm and then you would be addicted to the farm.

238
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:54,247
Speaker 1: But the thing is is not how it works.

239
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:57,780
Speaker 1: It's actually you sign into Facebook and it notifies you.

240
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,143
Speaker 1: Hey fix your farm notify you Hey fix your farm.

241
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:08,171
Speaker 1: and basically if you don't get these notifications that constantly remind you to fix your farm People aren't signing in to go fix their farm.

242
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:15,929
Speaker 1: They're not like intentionally clicking on Farmville They're just waiting for notifications that tell them Hey You have to do this and that's why they're doing it.

243
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:16,912
Speaker 1: because someone tells them to.

244
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:24,257
Speaker 1: it's like they get a task and the task Manager, you know a letter comes in the inbox and they have to handle the letter and out of the inbox and put it in the outbox.

245
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:34,609
Speaker 1: But if nothing comes in the inbox and they're required to actually go to Farmville of their own initiative They just don't know it because it's not a game There's there's not that it did.

246
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:40,450
Speaker 0: by like four different definitions of game Farmville does not meet the requirements to be called a game.

247
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:47,260
Speaker 0: You know, I guess the only one it meets is the loosest loosest one of you know, any sort of enjoyable pastime?

248
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:53,120
Speaker 1: I don't think it's enjoyable Is it is an activity.

249
00:13:53,922 --> 00:14:07,499
Speaker 0: The losses are being attributed pretty much straight up to the fact that Facebook changed the way it handles their gift requests and they eliminated The notifications that Zingo is using to basically advertise their game to people who are remind people to keep playing.

250
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,364
Speaker 1: basically Yeah, the advertising part.

251
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,551
Speaker 1: I don't think is you know was has changed.

252
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,360
Speaker 1: just the reminding people to acts that they've ordered already playing.

253
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,773
Speaker 1: They're not Constantly reminded to continue playing so they don't.

254
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:23,326
Speaker 0: it says a lot about Who is playing these games and and why

255
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,691
Speaker 1: and for what reasons and I would

256
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:46,043
Speaker 0: I would posit that it's really kind of the modern advertising equivalent of a Ponzi scheme where they make something that Tricks people into clicking on things and then they misuse statistics to say to prove to other people who also don't understand statistics We've got ten point six trillion people playing this game Advertised with us.

257
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:49,652
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and it's just this gigantic scam from start to finish.

258
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,658
Speaker 1: They're making everything is a gigantic scam.

259
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:52,520
Speaker 0: Not everything.

260
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,020
Speaker 0: We provide exactly what we say.

261
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,956
Speaker 1: We're yeah, which is why no one gives us any money because our numbers are legit.

262
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:00,840
Speaker 1: They're not inflating.

263
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:01,783
Speaker 1: I point out.

264
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,611
Speaker 0: at least a few people have tried to give us money.

265
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,173
Speaker 0: We just don't.

266
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,040
Speaker 1: why didn't give us enough money?

267
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah people look people try to give us money.

268
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,034
Speaker 0: They don't give us money.

269
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:15,236
Speaker 0: We can't want to give us like five Yeah, or those advertisers who keep like hey, we want to ever don't want to give us.

270
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:19,980
Speaker 0: they want to give us $10 Maybe 11 if we give them like a 20-minute ad in the middle.

271
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:24,394
Speaker 0: It's not happening, but there's other weird news on Farmville.

272
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:47,040
Speaker 0: And this is why I think this is interesting Facebook's changes that basically wrecked Zinga's games Probably this is just me speculating might have had to do with the fact that Facebook and Farmville were kind of fighting with each other Over this whole Facebook dollars or Facebook currency system Facebook credits They're called uh-huh, which is kind of like this currency in Facebook for microtransactions.

273
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:49,820
Speaker 1: All right, I'd even know they existed.

274
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:50,983
Speaker 0: I know I'd either.

275
00:15:51,023 --> 00:16:01,174
Speaker 0: but apparently what the deal is that in mafia wars and Farmville and all these bullshit Zinga quote-unquote games Why do people say quote unquote and then the word shouldn't?

276
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,400
Speaker 0: they say quote games unquote?

277
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,860
Speaker 0: Why am I just opening and closing quotes like in the middle of my anyway?

278
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:13,016
Speaker 0: So basically Facebook will facilitate these microtransactions for these games.

279
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:19,739
Speaker 0: when you buy your bullshit like you have four more points to spend on mafia in in the city and the proper noun proper noun.

280
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,040
Speaker 0: and Then Facebook gets a 30% cut of the money that changes hands through these transactions.

281
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:25,702
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

282
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,110
Speaker 1: This is real money or just like Warcraft gold.

283
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,300
Speaker 0: It's Warcraft gold, but I think you can buy it for money.

284
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,086
Speaker 0: I haven't dug into that at all.

285
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:48,371
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and there's hints here that there were rumors at least that that Zinga was talking thinking about with Farmville trying to make Farmville a standalone portal and get people to just go into that which At least from that other article wouldn't work at all.

286
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:49,655
Speaker 0: No one's gonna go to Farmville.

287
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,100
Speaker 0: a Farmville is Farmville by itself.

288
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:53,809
Speaker 0: They only go because their Facebook friends force them to.

289
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,800
Speaker 1: but there's also people are only on Facebook to get Farmville.

290
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:57,840
Speaker 1: It's like they're tied together.

291
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:01,380
Speaker 1: You know, there's people who are on Facebook, but they're not there for Farmville.

292
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,160
Speaker 1: You're there for Farmville, but they're not there for Facebook.

293
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,380
Speaker 0: We'd have to know how many like what percentages and I have no way to know that.

294
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,576
Speaker 1: I think the thing is by joining together, right?

295
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:20,348
Speaker 1: They're basically this symbiote where you know The people who are only interested in Farmville are upping Facebook's numbers and the people who are only interested in Facebook and are getting pestered By Farmville are upping Farmville's numbers.

296
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,240
Speaker 1: So they up each other's numbers by combining these two really powerful things.

297
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,393
Speaker 1: It's like imagine there are two TV stations and they just merged right?

298
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,780
Speaker 1: So now they basically both have double ratings.

299
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:32,157
Speaker 1: That's basically what it is.

300
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:38,160
Speaker 1: You know the people who would have watched You know show A and you're watching show B are now watching both shows.

301
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,413
Speaker 1: So now, you know one show had a million viewers.

302
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:41,419
Speaker 1: the other show had a million viewers.

303
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,779
Speaker 1: now They both have two million viewers.

304
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,350
Speaker 1: I mean, it's totally cheating.

305
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:51,673
Speaker 0: one thing I would say to all of you out there If you're if you care at all about the video game industry Any of the news and numbers about Zynga and all this?

306
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,080
Speaker 0: I don't think it's actually the game.

307
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,713
Speaker 0: I don't think gaming has anything to do with this whole, you know, Facebook Zynga, whatever They're not games and they're not made for gamers.

308
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,160
Speaker 0: There's this wholly separate industry.

309
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:07,396
Speaker 0: That's basically create a psychological trap to trick eyeballs and then sell those eyeballs to advertisers.

310
00:18:07,757 --> 00:18:08,038
Speaker 0: at least.

311
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:11,185
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft is Technically a game.

312
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:11,908
Speaker 0: It's more.

313
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:13,113
Speaker 1: it's more of a game than Farmville.

314
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:13,595
Speaker 1: There's some.

315
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:16,426
Speaker 1: it's not much more but it's more To its credit.

316
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:17,613
Speaker 0: there's stuff in there to do.

317
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,606
Speaker 0: if you like that sort of thing You know, you can play it.

318
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:21,880
Speaker 0: and they're still selling the game.

319
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,680
Speaker 0: They're selling the the carrot stick machine directly to the user.

320
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:29,720
Speaker 0: They're not using the carrot stick machine to trick a user in and then sell him.

321
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess World of Warcraft doesn't message you and it's like hey, you didn't finish this quest.

322
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:40,759
Speaker 0: I mean, hey you need to level up today, dude It's the difference between an HBO series versus a regular broadcast TV series.

323
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:45,134
Speaker 0: Broadcast TV the TV show is not the product and the watchers.

324
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:46,980
Speaker 0: the viewers are not the consumer.

325
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,427
Speaker 0: The product is the viewers and the consumers.

326
00:18:49,467 --> 00:19:02,516
Speaker 0: the advertisers and Zynga games are basically the same thing with the added basically the added revenue stream of microtransactions Mmm, so they're basically selling the people that they trick in with the machine World of Warcraft.

327
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:03,740
Speaker 0: They sell them the machine.

328
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:05,226
Speaker 0: So it's basically Soma.

329
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:08,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot watered-down shitty version of Soma.

330
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:17,220
Speaker 1: But the thing is Farmville does make a lot of money from Tricking people into just buying like plows and also getting people to do stupid offer.

331
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:25,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, but think if they do it through Facebook with the Facebook currency Then the people will have well, they'll be able to give them currency for dollars.

332
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:29,959
Speaker 0: They'll also be able to give them currency through other Facebook things if Facebook wanted to do that.

333
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:40,760
Speaker 0: So they could basically direct these eyeballs in all sorts of different directions Like hey click on this ad follow this, you know, listen to this guy's updates and we'll give you X Facebook credits.

334
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:42,848
Speaker 0: Mmm, I don't know if they'll do that.

335
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:43,652
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

336
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:57,341
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright things of the day you actually put that in the show.

337
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, why are you so corny?

338
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:00,070
Speaker 1: you stand Lee now?

339
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:04,250
Speaker 0: I am now talking into the microphone you little guy.

340
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:12,335
Speaker 1: So, you know, I always get bothered because they put out these lists of like, you know What anime are out this season.

341
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:17,090
Speaker 1: and the thing is those lists never include like the ongoing anime, right?

342
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:24,458
Speaker 1: You don't see like one piece on that list right because one piece is always on It just always is right.

343
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:34,254
Speaker 1: and and the result of that always will be yes The result of that is that there's a lot of shows, you know Basically the Simpsons equivalents in Japan the shows that never end They just keep going and going.

344
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:39,896
Speaker 1: and if anime fans in the US don't hear about them because no one's fan subs them No one talks about them.

345
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,189
Speaker 1: Nobody, you know, they're just always there.

346
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:46,546
Speaker 1: So one of those shows is Doraemon which you know is a kids show.

347
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:50,323
Speaker 1: it's for little kids But it's it's a lot better than a lot of the kids shows we have here.

348
00:20:50,384 --> 00:21:03,050
Speaker 1: come you know, good God I mean, you know, it's basically like the SpongeBob of The Asia but it's a lot of way 10 million times better than SpongeBob because SpongeBob is retarded like the character.

349
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,913
Speaker 1: He's a retard.

350
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:09,330
Speaker 1: Doraemon is like a really smart dude always brings out like wicked awesome gadgets and shit to save the day to this.

351
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:10,738
Speaker 1: Also fuck up the day.

352
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:16,107
Speaker 0: I understand a little bit but I mean I understand the appeals of like venture brothers and all those things there.

353
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:22,789
Speaker 0: most comedy I understand the appeal of but I would rather watch like the bad Three Stooges then watch SpongeBob.

354
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,198
Speaker 0: SpongeBob I just can't deal with it.

355
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:26,010
Speaker 1: But anyway, Doraemon is pretty cool.

356
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:33,054
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a kids show that you can probably watch and tolerate and not just kill yourself And it's also a manga.

357
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:45,090
Speaker 1: But anyway, somebody made took the Doraemon theme song a very famous theme song Yep, and they recreated the entire song Using only sound effects from Street Fighter 2.

358
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,695
Speaker 0: It's pretty amazing.

359
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:51,010
Speaker 1: even have like the video from Street Fighter 2 to go with the sound effects for Hindi.

360
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know this got posted all over the internet because it's pretty cool in and of itself.

361
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:02,040
Speaker 1: But a lot of people who watched it didn't realize that it was the Doraemon theme or if they did they didn't know what Doraemon Was.

362
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:02,610
Speaker 0: so it was funny.

363
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:11,006
Speaker 0: You know I Yuko and Athan Conrad and John were all hanging out over the weekend and I showed that to them and immediately Yuko was like Doraemon.

364
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:14,481
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, the people they don't know.

365
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:15,529
Speaker 0: Well now they know.

366
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:21,630
Speaker 0: So along the lines of a video game related thing of the day that is also on College Humor.

367
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,989
Speaker 0: I have another video game related thing of the day.

368
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,777
Speaker 1: Can you please look at like a different website.

369
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,783
Speaker 0: yours is also on College Humor.

370
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:30,026
Speaker 1: I saw it before.

371
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:31,310
Speaker 1: it was on College Humor.

372
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:33,750
Speaker 1: Curse them, curse them.

373
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:36,696
Speaker 0: They're pretty much you know.

374
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:38,727
Speaker 0: I'll let you all in on the secret.

375
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:44,250
Speaker 0: once again I skip a lot of them because I try to avoid going back to College Humor as my go-to place for things of the day.

376
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,150
Speaker 0: But there is at least one good video worth watching on the internet every day on College Humor.

377
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,568
Speaker 0: That's the best video aggregator on the entire internet right now that I have found.

378
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:54,959
Speaker 0: yes If you know of a better one let me know.

379
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:57,510
Speaker 0: and if you say dig you're a damn dirty liar.

380
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:02,007
Speaker 0: So this is 8-bit Starcraft I think.

381
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:02,770
Speaker 0: what does this fun?

382
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:05,890
Speaker 1: This is also on every other website before it was in College Humor, so it's okay.

383
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,644
Speaker 1: The graphics is linked to a non College Humor source.

384
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,650
Speaker 0: work out really well.

385
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,477
Speaker 0: I think you should link to the College Humor.

386
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:14,430
Speaker 0: we had to let him know that it's us driving all this traffic to them.

387
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:16,195
Speaker 1: So much traffic because they need.

388
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:18,603
Speaker 1: so it's such a flood of traffic.

389
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:19,064
Speaker 1: We're sending.

390
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:19,686
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

391
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:20,368
Speaker 1: Oh you guys.

392
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:21,494
Speaker 1: It's unbelievable All right.

393
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,088
Speaker 0: Wow actually you know now that I never really look at it.

394
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:28,224
Speaker 0: I never look at the stuff on College Humor except for the video.

395
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:32,243
Speaker 0: if I scroll down though You know what's at the top of recommended videos?

396
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:35,753
Speaker 0: You'll like right under this Washington mmm-hmm.

397
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:42,790
Speaker 0: yeah awesome, but I think what does it for me in this video is the sound that the little Marines make when they're running.

398
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,761
Speaker 0: Hmm no no I guess we should do the meta moment.

399
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:50,844
Speaker 1: Oh fuck meta moment.

400
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh shit book club is cosmos.

401
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,481
Speaker 0: We're gonna do the show soon, so uh read the book.

402
00:23:55,702 --> 00:24:00,364
Speaker 1: probably then not this Thursday But the Thursday episode after that is probably gonna be it.

403
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:06,790
Speaker 1: yeah after all this time What multiple months of not doing the book means you have no goddamn excuse?

404
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I didn't even start reading it, but I got a copy and I'm gonna start reading it real soon And I'll have it finished that quickly.

405
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:15,689
Speaker 0: so the geek knights coding club is still a project Dorf.

406
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:19,823
Speaker 1: It'll probably be that I gotta I gotta do some stuff on that there.

407
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:22,010
Speaker 1: I've been I've been doing some other stuff.

408
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:23,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to jump in on it.

409
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,369
Speaker 0: I've been by Java.

410
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,622
Speaker 0: They'll probably be a huge flood of stuff this weekend.

411
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:30,392
Speaker 1: cuz look at the new laptop, and I'll set the shit up Awesome.

412
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:33,542
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm not gonna do anything until after kinetic on is completely.

413
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:38,050
Speaker 0: until until I send the schedule to print for kinetic on I'm not gonna work on project Dorf at all.

414
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:44,950
Speaker 0: If any other medicine that we're doing the live streaming shows you can watch those if you want.

415
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,795
Speaker 0: They're nothing special.

416
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:46,741
Speaker 0: you just see what we look like.

417
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:49,336
Speaker 0: you know looking into our microphones Just go to the.

418
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,362
Speaker 1: actually is a secret.

419
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:58,799
Speaker 1: if you go to front row crew calm which I'm gonna start doing some more work on pretty soon the use stream is embedded in the front page so you can just go There and sort of.

420
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,810
Speaker 1: you know and if you know what day of the week It is just you know around six seven ish just wait and eventually you know probably six.

421
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:13,120
Speaker 1: If you want to start watching six Eastern 6 p.m.. Eastern just wait and eventually it'll be like tada live now And you push play and you'll be all set.

422
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:19,890
Speaker 0: yep now also Bit by bit we're gonna start doing our I guess proper video shows where we'll actually be looking at the camera.

423
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:25,706
Speaker 0: There'll be video content as the primary thing as opposed to audio that we happen to be filming ourselves doing.

424
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:30,561
Speaker 0: I mean this new stream is basically What like watching Howard Stern do his show?

425
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,950
Speaker 0: It's just you know guys microphones pop filter.

426
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:43,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I hope that it gets us some exposure because if we get enough viewers that are simultaneous Then we'll get on the front page of you stream, and then we'll get viewers that weren't coming for us specifically.

427
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:47,422
Speaker 1: They're just coming to you stream And they see us there and then they discover geek nights.

428
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:47,703
Speaker 1: right.

429
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:49,210
Speaker 0: is the way to do that really for us?

430
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:55,910
Speaker 0: You know meta is to do Actual straight-up video shows because remember how many people we had when we scheduled ahead of time a video show.

431
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was like we had like over a hundred people's as a lot of people's.

432
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:01,407
Speaker 0: yeah Especially considering the short notice we gave on that one.

433
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,692
Speaker 0: I mean Plus.

434
00:26:02,973 --> 00:26:09,192
Speaker 0: that got us on the front page of you stream which proceeded to fill the channel with basically the most vile shit cockery I've seen.

435
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:12,689
Speaker 1: that's all right because the new you stream now has better shit cockery protections.

436
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,037
Speaker 0: Yeah It's almost too good.

437
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

438
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:15,930
Speaker 1: It's a little too strong.

439
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:25,939
Speaker 0: Scott and I we pride ourselves in being very good gamers at certain things like German board games have mad skills At many things we don't have like you know like art.

440
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,847
Speaker 1: We have good FPS skills, but we're not exactly.

441
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:32,037
Speaker 0: you know I mean fatality level.

442
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:32,739
Speaker 0: yeah, we're not.

443
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:37,848
Speaker 0: we're not like planning it up in the quake 3 arena or anything But you know we're solid like counter-strike.

444
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:44,518
Speaker 0: We were some of the better players than the RIT servers back in the day yeah, and like German board games You've got no chance against us unless you're.

445
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:49,950
Speaker 0: I mean it said when we go to like all these board game meetups And we basically just wreck everybody all the time.

446
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:56,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is despite our high level of skill at many kinds of games which point out confirmation bias We talk about the games.

447
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,148
Speaker 0: We're good at a lot.

448
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:58,731
Speaker 1: Yeah,

449
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,356
Speaker 0: it might seem like we're full of ourselves,

450
00:27:00,877 --> 00:27:04,046
Speaker 1: but there are many kinds of games that we are no good at

451
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:07,032
Speaker 0: chief among them Chief

452
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:11,389
Speaker 1: among the kinds of games we suck at our fighting games though the skills are improving

453
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:11,630
Speaker 0: yeah

454
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:15,983
Speaker 1: and Most of all real-time strategy games and fanatical

455
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:16,826
Speaker 0: devotion to the Pope.

456
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:26,385
Speaker 1: We're just the worst Real-time strategy, I just fucking like back in the day I would play Starcraft Starcraft 1 against the computer right.

457
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:27,430
Speaker 0: I could even beat the computer.

458
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,177
Speaker 1: I would just do.

459
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,329
Speaker 1: I would just do a skirmish.

460
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:31,416
Speaker 1: It was just straight up like Terran vs.

461
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,542
Speaker 1: Zerg computers controlling the zergs right.

462
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:36,452
Speaker 1: I would start building a base a Wave.

463
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:38,287
Speaker 1: a little zergs would come like 10 of them.

464
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:42,082
Speaker 1: Maybe Probably less than 10. most of the time.

465
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:43,849
Speaker 1: that little tiny wave would kill me now.

466
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,990
Speaker 1: Sometimes what I would do is I would go okay I know that little wave is gonna come right away.

467
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,169
Speaker 1: It happens every time and I would rush to build a barracks in some Marines So that I could hold it off, and it would work.

468
00:27:54,531 --> 00:28:13,699
Speaker 1: I would hold off that little wave right and then I would keep going and going and going and the Second wave would come with like friggin big-ass zergs Before and I'd still have that little bunch of Marines and no matter how hard I tried to build more guys it Wouldn't do mean anything, and I would just get host

469
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:15,166
Speaker 0: command and conquer.

470
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,914
Speaker 0: was the first one I really like?

471
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:22,376
Speaker 1: played hardcore really I played Warcraft 1. well What was the first?

472
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,419
Speaker 1: I mean you.

473
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:27,351
Speaker 1: I usually tend to think that the first real-time strategy was Warcraft 1.

474
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:30,322
Speaker 1: But I mean is metal Marines was sort of a real-time strategy.

475
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:32,410
Speaker 1: and wasn't it a dune game for the PC?

476
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,916
Speaker 1: That was sort of a real-time strategy.

477
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:34,519
Speaker 1: was that older.

478
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,323
Speaker 1: You know.

479
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:36,890
Speaker 1: I'm not sure which one came first.

480
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,054
Speaker 1: I don't know really matters.

481
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,824
Speaker 0: I tried to just type RTS into Wikipedia.

482
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:46,282
Speaker 0: mm-hmm and Real-time strategy game is not the first thing that comes up.

483
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,830
Speaker 0: the first thing that comes up is rape trauma system.

484
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,533
Speaker 1: That's fantastic.

485
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,017
Speaker 0: That's just great great.

486
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:54,484
Speaker 0: All right precursors and early Genesis.

487
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,450
Speaker 0: here rim goes to Wikipedia.

488
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:04,063
Speaker 0: Herzog's way for the Sega Genesis 1989 is the earliest example of a game that falls under the contemporary definition of a modern RTS.

489
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:05,548
Speaker 1: really Herzog's we.

490
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:06,410
Speaker 1: I've heard of that game.

491
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:07,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, 19.

492
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:08,860
Speaker 1: I thought it was like a space shooter.

493
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,965
Speaker 1: I guess I was totally wrong.

494
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,210
Speaker 1: control only never played.

495
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:12,294
Speaker 1: I just I just it.

496
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:14,221
Speaker 1: doesn't that sound like the name of a space shooter to you?

497
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:16,830
Speaker 0: it that totally sounds like her zog's way.

498
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,408
Speaker 1: That's definitely a space shooter name.

499
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,944
Speaker 1: Okay, see a dune to the building of a dynasty right.

500
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:22,526
Speaker 1: so I was right.

501
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:26,521
Speaker 1: and then Warcraft in 94 was like the first one.

502
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:27,725
Speaker 1: that was like for reals.

503
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:28,909
Speaker 1: and then command and conquer.

504
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:33,486
Speaker 0: and then Well cool Wikipedia command and conquer became the first popular RTS.

505
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:37,827
Speaker 1: Yeah Well Warcraft 1 was really but it was no.

506
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,648
Speaker 0: But the thing is command and conquer was the first one that I wanted to be good at like.

507
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:47,710
Speaker 0: I was like you know What and I've said this many times in my life about many things like Smash Brothers.

508
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:50,720
Speaker 0: I am going to put forth the effort.

509
00:29:50,760 --> 00:30:00,170
Speaker 0: It will take to be good at this game and I Could not beat either Campaign in that game or red alert.

510
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:02,156
Speaker 0: Furthermore when I play it online.

511
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,781
Speaker 0: I just got hosed.

512
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:05,145
Speaker 1: see I could actually beat that.

513
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:07,113
Speaker 1: beat the campaign in Warcraft 1.

514
00:30:07,113 --> 00:30:08,883
Speaker 1: I could beat the campaign in Warcraft 2.

515
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:09,627
Speaker 1: I just never owned it.

516
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:11,838
Speaker 1: man It's got to be cheap to get that game now right.

517
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:13,866
Speaker 0: sure there's got to be a steam pack or something.

518
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:14,690
Speaker 1: Warcraft 2 is good.

519
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:17,623
Speaker 1: Well, no no blizzard stuff is on steam.

520
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:18,046
Speaker 1: They do.

521
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,558
Speaker 1: they roll their own but then Command and conquer.

522
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:25,170
Speaker 1: I was able to beat command and conquer red alert.

523
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:28,843
Speaker 1: I beat you know on single-player, but playing multiplayer like.

524
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:34,190
Speaker 1: I played multiplayer Warcraft 1 and 2 But I played against like people I could dial up with so it was sort of even ish.

525
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,977
Speaker 1: When I you know it wasn't.

526
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:43,246
Speaker 1: until I try to play red alert dialing up against someone I knew that I learned just how much I sucked because basically it was they're playing red alert.

527
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:44,630
Speaker 1: I was the allies.

528
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:45,516
Speaker 1: They were the Soviets.

529
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:45,979
Speaker 1: right.

530
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,490
Speaker 1: this is the first red alert on DOS.

531
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,182
Speaker 1: We dialed into each other the game totally worked, and we're playing.

532
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:55,636
Speaker 1: and then eventually I use the spy Plane to see what they had.

533
00:30:55,937 --> 00:31:03,030
Speaker 1: and basically their base was so packed with tanks that nothing could move And they just had like tanks like just spilling out completely filling their area

534
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:04,601
Speaker 0: And then at some point those tanks that

535
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:07,477
Speaker 1: moving and yeah at some point They just select it all and clicked on my base

536
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,501
Speaker 0: all tanks roll,

537
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:12,998
Speaker 1: and I had like a handful of dudes And it's like what the hell.

538
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:17,675
Speaker 0: of course Scott to be fair you have the same problem in turn-based strategy games But not not.

539
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,261
Speaker 1: you know not to that extent.

540
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,250
Speaker 1: You know it's a completely different situation.

541
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:26,436
Speaker 0: Well my problem really was that I wasn't so good at the campaigns But the campaigns were often not fun.

542
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:28,603
Speaker 0: at least knows early RTS is I actually?

543
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:30,549
Speaker 1: I like the campaigns like in Warcraft one.

544
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:31,214
Speaker 1: you get The campaign.

545
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:31,455
Speaker 1: we're like.

546
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:32,403
Speaker 1: you have the one guy.

547
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,149
Speaker 1: he's like the famous guy And you got to protect him while you walk through the dungeon.

548
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:40,410
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a real-time dungeon crawly bit almost like a hero quest where you don't have to wait and take turns.

549
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:46,969
Speaker 0: I guess I just I've always really only played games like this or any game like this just to get to the multiplayer.

550
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,970
Speaker 0: and What really messed me up was that the multiplayer you know dial-up?

551
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,939
Speaker 0: I only played with people that you know.

552
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,309
Speaker 0: we dial into each other's modems and play like command and cock.

553
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,104
Speaker 1: yeah I never played the multiplayer's.

554
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:05,915
Speaker 1: Real RTS is for real like that much at all ever until very very recently, but we were all Stupid.

555
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:06,518
Speaker 0: it's kind of like.

556
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:14,470
Speaker 0: imagine if you saw a bunch of people playing like tag But they all just like sucked at tag like no one tried to tag back But usually like okay.

557
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:22,010
Speaker 1: So we all play like a German board game against each other and we all don't know how to play it at all and we Keep playing and we keep playing keep playing we get better and we learn things about the game.

558
00:32:22,212 --> 00:32:32,719
Speaker 0: I do that now with RTS is too But when I was a kid with video games for some reason sometimes I just wouldn't do that like there's some video games when I was very young But I just never got better at.

559
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,978
Speaker 0: and now that I'm older and I'd like play a game like that again I get better because I try to get better.

560
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,603
Speaker 1: the thing is with RTS is.

561
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:44,892
Speaker 1: it's like I try to get better and no amount Of effort that I put into it just on my own Like.

562
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:49,430
Speaker 1: if I just sit there playing an RTS against the computer over and over and over again I just can't get better.

563
00:32:49,732 --> 00:33:00,030
Speaker 1: I need someone to like tell me like I was playing Starcraft 2 because I got the beta key because I pre-ordered an Amazon right just because I'm in this phase where I want to try To play games that I suck at and get better at them on purpose.

564
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,870
Speaker 1: Yeah to see if I can and for a change of pace in terms of the games I'm playing.

565
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:12,070
Speaker 1: So they give you like these five practice games And then they give you like these five games where it determines like your league ranking or whatever.

566
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,078
Speaker 1: And I'm of course in the worst possible league though.

567
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:16,247
Speaker 1: I'm not in last place in the worst possible league.

568
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:21,790
Speaker 1: start Yeah, you're beating guy who logs in and then being guy who's even worse than me by a little bit.

569
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,132
Speaker 1: You're beating

570
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:24,301
Speaker 0: like guy whose mouse stopped working

571
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:30,809
Speaker 1: and the thing is I won some of those games But they were against people who were just as bad as me and the thing was the reason I was able to win it

572
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,090
Speaker 0: all

573
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:41,896
Speaker 1: Is because the first guy I played against actually talked to me and he actually helped me out and he was like, dude You are not building nearly enough of the basic resource getting guy You need to build like a shit ton of them.

574
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,844
Speaker 1: and I was like, well how many he's like.

575
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:50,650
Speaker 1: for each pile of rocks Build like three and for each, you know little gas factory build three.

576
00:33:51,212 --> 00:34:02,190
Speaker 1: So what I did is the next time I played I just built a ton of those guys and the thing was it was really hard to build a ton of those guys and to also build the stuff and I'm still doing it really shittily.

577
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:06,746
Speaker 1: But at least I'm not doing it so shittily that they come over with a huge army and I have nothing.

578
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:15,809
Speaker 1: I have something you know that gets destroyed and You know, so when I played against people who were you know, actually good I still had basically no chance.

579
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:26,668
Speaker 1: but when I played against you know people who were just as shitty as I was it was like in sometimes it was even and Once I even like, you know defended and then came back and destroyed the other guy.

580
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:36,170
Speaker 1: And because this is playing against people equal skill And I think what it is is that they have a system set up to where you don't play against people Who are way better or way worse than you, but it'll still mix it up.

581
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:52,929
Speaker 0: I think part of my problem was that back in the old days, you know with the with the modems you had this kind of Closed ecosystem of your friends like, you know, you see this with things like air hockey We're like one guy and a group of friends can get good But no one like the group doesn't get to the next echelon with command and conquer, especially in games like it.

582
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:58,966
Speaker 0: We would always end up just playing these really dumb Strategies that were fun because the fun part for me was like building a gigantic base.

583
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:07,610
Speaker 1: that is you know I think that Actraiser is like the best thing to look at in terms of how I feel about RTS is like if you could just gave me an RTS and it was only single-player.

584
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:15,348
Speaker 1: It's so fun because it's like well, I'll just build a base and which is totally fun right and then building all these units is totally fun.

585
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:20,449
Speaker 1: and Then you know like the actual ordering of the units is not really that fun.

586
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,929
Speaker 1: It's really actually kind of boring and I wish they wouldn't have that part of the game.

587
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:29,790
Speaker 0: Well, you mean the part of the game where you play a shitty side scroller to get back to the fun farming game.

588
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:42,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly I Guess it's weird that like me and all my friends at least when I was young playing this game over a modem all felt the Same way, we'd always play kind of a gentleman's agreement where we were just Nobody attack each other.

589
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:45,490
Speaker 1: so we can have lots of fun building bases and then we'll attack each other.

590
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,925
Speaker 1: It was basically once we built our bases 100% completely.

591
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:55,857
Speaker 0: The trouble was it was basically sim based because we build the bases and like a half hour went by and then we'd finally decide To fight and usually around.

592
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:58,670
Speaker 0: then is when like one of the motives would crap out and the game would break.

593
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:08,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing that bothers me is that like I'm as I'm playing Starcraft a little bit more not that much I'm still busy with other things but a little bit more I'm learning all these things that people do like.

594
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:20,230
Speaker 1: what they'll do is they'll send one of those nothing guys over to your base Right away, and if you don't build like a marine or something right away It'll walk in and take a look at your base and there's like nothing you can do about it.

595
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,130
Speaker 1: So it's like oh fuck get the hell out of here.

596
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,142
Speaker 1: You get this thing pestering you and looking around and they can see all your shit.

597
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:25,966
Speaker 1: and it's like.

598
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:28,341
Speaker 1: and they can see how far Along you are and everything.

599
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:31,395
Speaker 0: and it's like You know what that is?

600
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:37,398
Speaker 0: That's the equivalent of tapping the prodigal sorcerer, you know There's all this kind of like stupid little.

601
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,970
Speaker 1: you know tricks like that that are just like really annoying.

602
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,698
Speaker 1: It's nothing to do with military strategy.

603
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:47,470
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say nothing that you know, I wouldn't say that they're necessarily stupid.

604
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:57,139
Speaker 0: It's that we have this problem that RTS has become this very defined genre among most people and I feel like The kind it's kind of like MMOs.

605
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,110
Speaker 0: when people like MMO they think of games like World of Warcraft But an MMO could be you know any sort of massive game.

606
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:10,924
Speaker 0: We need more real-time strategy games that have vastly different paradigms from the Starcraft style click sequence games that we have now.

607
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:12,250
Speaker 0: I think those games are good.

608
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:14,664
Speaker 0: I just think I would like other kinds of RTS's.

609
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:15,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean people.

610
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:18,024
Speaker 1: We know how much we've talked about this game on the show.

611
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:19,150
Speaker 1: There's a game called metal Marines.

612
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:20,610
Speaker 1: I would reckon it was for windows.

613
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,090
Speaker 0: Actually that good of a game because I think it was a great game.

614
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:25,657
Speaker 0: Round one awesome.

615
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:26,984
Speaker 0: round two pretty fun.

616
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:30,730
Speaker 0: the rest of the game Horrifying and tedious because it was poorly designed.

617
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:33,838
Speaker 1: No But I mean go it's for this get it.

618
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,432
Speaker 1: the best way to play is to get it for a Super Nintendo or Super Nintendo Emulator.

619
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:45,754
Speaker 1: just play the first like two missions to see what we're talking about and you'll see it is a real-time strategy game But it is not anything like Starcraft.

620
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:48,550
Speaker 1: I mean you do build a base and you do build units and you attack.

621
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:55,390
Speaker 1: But the way you control the units and the way you build the things is not like Starcraft at all.

622
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:01,070
Speaker 1: It's it's barely like it and and you know, but it is still a game that is real-time and has strategy.

623
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:03,578
Speaker 1: So I think that's you know, that's the thing is like.

624
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,087
Speaker 1: I want a game that is real-time and has strategy.

625
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:08,130
Speaker 1: because a non real-time Game, that's good.

626
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:17,009
Speaker 1: I like my turn-based games like the Wesnoth and the advanced wars and such but they take a long Time and you spend all this time doing nothing when it's the other person's turn.

627
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:18,838
Speaker 1: So if it's real time be better.

628
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:25,710
Speaker 1: the problem is is when it's real time It's all about who can go really fast with the clicking and not who can you know.

629
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:32,921
Speaker 0: So it's like even if I can think in my brain the strategy Implementation is part of the skill of a game like this like that.

630
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:33,824
Speaker 0: I mean Street Fighter.

631
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:35,630
Speaker 0: All right, let's pause it.

632
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:42,249
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do sure you can and then I'm gonna do this and then up I've got a pause and change this thing before we take our next turn.

633
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:43,955
Speaker 1: No, but it's it's.

634
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:44,857
Speaker 1: it's more that.

635
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:47,345
Speaker 1: okay if it's a strategy game, right?

636
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,130
Speaker 1: I mean Street Fighter is a fighting game.

637
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,242
Speaker 1: It's about fighting and the speed is.

638
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:52,530
Speaker 0: this is what I'm saying.

639
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,698
Speaker 0: We we've conflated like RTS.

640
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:57,670
Speaker 0: real-time strategy became this very narrow genre.

641
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:00,720
Speaker 1: Yep, but it's like the game should.

642
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:04,935
Speaker 1: the ideal game should be about your strategic decisions Even though it's real time.

643
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:06,621
Speaker 1: It should just be about the decision you make.

644
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:09,070
Speaker 1: did you make the good decision or the bad decision?

645
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,615
Speaker 1: So here's the thing, right?

646
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:26,890
Speaker 1: So my decision is to a good strategic decision might be like, okay I'm gonna have the tanks You know flank and I'm gonna send in some planes as a decoy to distract your anti ground planes and then I'm gonna rush in with These guys from the south and that's that's my strategy.

647
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:29,249
Speaker 1: Well, so I click and I say tanks do this.

648
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:33,528
Speaker 1: I say tanks go here planes go here units go here and they do it.

649
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:36,670
Speaker 1: But they just go like in a straight line and it totally doesn't work.

650
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,383
Speaker 1: I have to go to like each unit and be like click move two feet.

651
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:40,307
Speaker 1: this way click move two feet.

652
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:40,809
Speaker 1: that way click.

653
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,654
Speaker 1: you Constantly click.

654
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:43,077
Speaker 1: crazily.

655
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:46,254
Speaker 0: that was what really got to control each Individual unit.

656
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:51,050
Speaker 1: as if I'm playing a game of control the single individual unit and control all of them like a man in conquer.

657
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,290
Speaker 0: I just always try to like make a strategy like that.

658
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,494
Speaker 0: You know an ambush or whatever.

659
00:39:54,815 --> 00:39:59,833
Speaker 0: and then I watched a good player playing and he basically just selected all his tanks and clicked On the enemy base.

660
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:09,276
Speaker 1: No, I watch guys like play like Starcraft or even like, you know The heroes of new worth type type of games which are basically real, you know Same kind of thing.

661
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:11,030
Speaker 1: and they may say click like nuts.

662
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:18,126
Speaker 1: They're like, you know move to the left move to the right move up move down Attack that guy once back up attack that guy once back up.

663
00:40:18,227 --> 00:40:18,568
Speaker 1: It's like.

664
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:25,410
Speaker 1: That's not strategy if I have to control each and every limb of each and every unit, right?

665
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,470
Speaker 1: That's a much lower level interaction.

666
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:34,270
Speaker 1: That's like even more lower level than an FPS where I'm controlling the aim and movement of one individual unit.

667
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:40,273
Speaker 1: That is enough to occupy an entire human brain, right if I had to do it for an entire army Fuck that.

668
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:40,815
Speaker 1: right.

669
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:50,410
Speaker 1: if I'm controlling an entire army the extent to which I should have to interact with that army is you Do this done, you know you ten guys attack base.

670
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,129
Speaker 1: That's that I shouldn't have to control them any more than that.

671
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,020
Speaker 1: I should do it as best as it possibly can be done.

672
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,590
Speaker 0: another style of RTS that I've been playing again a lot and then Stopped playing very, you know again for involved.

673
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:10,789
Speaker 0: There are the games like medieval total war where you have like the real-time ness of an army battle And it's much more well on the surface strategic like that.

674
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:17,890
Speaker 0: But as far as I can see almost everyone who actually plays these games skips that part and plays the shitty turn-based game.

675
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:20,762
Speaker 0: That is kind of just around the real-time part of the game.

676
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:21,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even know why.

677
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,218
Speaker 1: I mean that if you look at The previews for all those total war games.

678
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:27,881
Speaker 1: I played the demo of the first one in like the late night Like all of them on a steam.

679
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:32,470
Speaker 1: really Wow Yeah, so the thing is you look at the demos for those games.

680
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,166
Speaker 1: They always show you the big battles with tons of units.

681
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:36,690
Speaker 0: That's what I want That's what I play.

682
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:42,957
Speaker 0: But as far as the thing is every win every battle if you have more guys than the other guy by just clicking on all Your guys and saying attack.

683
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:45,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't actually implement the strategy part.

684
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,250
Speaker 1: They only implemented the graphics part of those battles.

685
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,650
Speaker 0: Well, even worse what got me is that the stupidest meta strategies work just because the games are so poor.

686
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:55,396
Speaker 1: Games are so rock-paper-scissors.

687
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:59,330
Speaker 1: It's like oh just use the archers against those guys and you win.

688
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:04,202
Speaker 0: Well, the AI is so shitty that I can do tricks like have my guys to advance pull back advance pull back.

689
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:11,416
Speaker 0: events pull back advance pull back and like Trick an enemy move unit into not moving while the horses just walk around behind him and then charge Yep, like that.

690
00:42:11,557 --> 00:42:13,910
Speaker 0: None of that would really work and it's just kind of silly and fiddly.

691
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:17,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not implemented really well at all.

692
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,950
Speaker 0: What would make RTS is that I want great.

693
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,802
Speaker 0: This is why natural selection is such a great game to me.

694
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:24,590
Speaker 0: It's for one player at least.

695
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:31,690
Speaker 0: It's an RTS where every single unit you control has a human level AI because it's an actual human.

696
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:49,770
Speaker 0: but in a game like a man in college imagine if you could give units more meta orders like you give them a zone like say you draw a zone on the map and say control this zone or Protect this zone or bombard this zone and you give them orders and simple macros and then let them go.

697
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,585
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's the one one thing that you can do to help.

698
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,635
Speaker 1: RTS is out Right is right.

699
00:42:54,715 --> 00:43:02,945
Speaker 1: now if you let's say I'm playing Starcraft right and I've got something that drops bombs I click on a spot and it drops the bombs on that spot.

700
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:06,299
Speaker 0: exactly right now There's a valid place for a game like that.

701
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:14,710
Speaker 1: The thing is what they should do is They should make the get the RTS right like look at that 8-bit Starcraft video, right?

702
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:16,215
Speaker 1: That's how it should be.

703
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:22,176
Speaker 1: break the map up into sort of a grid that doesn't have that many squares in it Just a few areas.

704
00:43:22,196 --> 00:43:45,370
Speaker 1: then I would say hey you bomb this area, you know and then the guy would do a bombing run in that area and I could give a lot more general orders because They don't have to you know, pick individual spots I can say okay we're gonna send 20 infantry to this square on the map and 30 tanks to that square on the map and we're gonna you know defend this square on the map.

705
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,763
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say they because you don't want to change Starcraft like that.

706
00:43:48,823 --> 00:43:49,988
Speaker 0: Starcraft has to be Starcraft.

707
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,880
Speaker 0: I mean Starcraft is a genre in and of itself.

708
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:54,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not saying it has to be Starcraft.

709
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:56,357
Speaker 1: I just said it should be an RTS.

710
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:56,739
Speaker 1: you get.

711
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:04,610
Speaker 1: it would be better if instead of clicking Individual point XY coordinates on the map you had this sort of lower resolution grid.

712
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:10,487
Speaker 1: That's you know has not that many squares like maybe like like a 10 by 10 grid.

713
00:44:10,787 --> 00:44:11,670
Speaker 1: and that's the whole map.

714
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:21,910
Speaker 1: and it's all about you know controlling the different squares on the map and It's really easy to give orders when the only positioning that goes on is which one of the hundred squares are you clicking on?

715
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:27,975
Speaker 0: Yep, or even if you don't have the squares I do like the idea of having an RTS or you know I think it had to be hexes.

716
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:34,518
Speaker 0: well where you can draw an area on the map like you have to like you're examining the Train looking at features and you can draw areas.

717
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:40,237
Speaker 0: you basically define your zones and define zones of control and Bombardment and all the kind of.

718
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:43,310
Speaker 1: I guess the only thing with that right is like maybe that would be cool.

719
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,824
Speaker 1: I'm like a like an iPad kind of thing.

720
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:50,050
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah mouse drawing Yeah, but if you're trying to draw with the mouse or something, right?

721
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,389
Speaker 1: You're gonna see the amount of time that you could have spent drawing your little area, right?

722
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,269
Speaker 1: You could have clicked on your base a whole bunch and built a whole bunch of buildings and units and all that kind of stuff.

723
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:08,573
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I guess part of it's that if we really break that sound to its root most of the RTS is out today are aimed.

724
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:14,619
Speaker 0: it's kind of like fighting games like they're aimed at a certain kind of gamer and there are so many other possibilities.

725
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:23,455
Speaker 0: and RTS is that either aren't possible due to Technological limitations of things like AI and aren't possible because no one with resources is Experimenting in the genre.

726
00:45:23,816 --> 00:45:25,984
Speaker 0: that much supreme commander did a lot of cool stuff.

727
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:35,302
Speaker 1: There's that ruse game that's experimenting But like it's it's a little bit better because you don't have to click on the exact Positions as much and the map is a little different.

728
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:50,615
Speaker 1: and it's got some sort of interesting things Like you can send out fake stuff and you know, it's the thing is the game was still I played it and it's like, okay There's some good ideas in here But the implementation really isn't polished and a hundred percent enough and there's way too much going on And there's no.

729
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:53,390
Speaker 1: is I gotta tell you about something just in general here, right?

730
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:57,784
Speaker 1: People making betas of games and such right the two.

731
00:45:57,864 --> 00:45:59,569
Speaker 1: if you're making a video game that's big.

732
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,459
Speaker 1: The tutorial is the first thing that you should make.

733
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:03,823
Speaker 1: I get a Starcraft 2 beta.

734
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:05,750
Speaker 1: no fucking tutorial, right?

735
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,738
Speaker 0: It's why the only people play in the beta.

736
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,647
Speaker 0: people already know about it doesn't?

737
00:46:09,727 --> 00:46:10,310
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter.

738
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:13,039
Speaker 1: The tutorial is the first thing you make.

739
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,965
Speaker 1: what if they don't want noobs playing it.

740
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,310
Speaker 1: Why do they have practice mode in?

741
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:21,890
Speaker 0: Why make the tutorial if you're gonna probably have to change it as you change things from the beta?

742
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:25,365
Speaker 1: The same reason that you mean you're making like, you know software.

743
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:28,542
Speaker 1: you make tests for things Even though you have to change the text the tutorial.

744
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:32,090
Speaker 0: it should be a part of beta testing But I think it should be part of the end of beta test.

745
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:38,658
Speaker 1: I think the tutorial should be the first thing that you make because basically a game without A game without a tutorial is basically useless.

746
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:43,490
Speaker 1: And also if you don't have a tutorial you at least need a fucking instruction book.

747
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:44,914
Speaker 1: There's no instructions.

748
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:45,576
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

749
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:47,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't find them hundred percent sure.

750
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:48,424
Speaker 0: I cannot.

751
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:55,250
Speaker 1: I cannot find any help Whatsoever right in Starcraft 2 I basically have to learn by trial and error.

752
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,494
Speaker 0: All right Just you look pretty funny.

753
00:46:56,534 --> 00:47:02,123
Speaker 1: if some of some listener like emails and someone knows what the manual is Feel free to send it to me, but I have not found it.

754
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,270
Speaker 1: I have poked every menu.

755
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,401
Speaker 0: I just I disagree with the methodology.

756
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:10,510
Speaker 0: if you're at the point of just beta testing I mean beta testing is so I make I make a little board game, right?

757
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,090
Speaker 1: I'm making a brand new board game and I give it to some people to test.

758
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,350
Speaker 1: I'm not there right to help them and I didn't put any instructions in there.

759
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,489
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying you give them like a basic instruction or rule, but there's nothing in there.

760
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:20,396
Speaker 1: Nothing I'm not.

761
00:47:20,517 --> 00:47:22,130
Speaker 0: I'm just talking about the tutorial part.

762
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:27,883
Speaker 0: I think the idea of making saying that you know The tutorial should be finished before you release the beta is ludicrous.

763
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:29,650
Speaker 1: doesn't be finished, but you got to have it in there.

764
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,372
Speaker 0: I don't think you do.

765
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:33,200
Speaker 1: tutorial is the first thing you need.

766
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:33,822
Speaker 0: I disagree.

767
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:35,527
Speaker 1: Otherwise your game is basically unplayable.

768
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:39,926
Speaker 0: Uh Apparently it's not because plenty of people are beta testing Starcraft just fine.

769
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:40,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are nuts.

770
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:46,224
Speaker 1: I can't even know what half the shit does And there's no way to play single-player at all.

771
00:47:46,284 --> 00:47:47,250
Speaker 1: It's multiplayer only.

772
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:54,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only way I can figure out to learn and what anything does is basically to lose while experimenting with some weird thing.

773
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:54,717
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

774
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:56,030
Speaker 0: you don't want an unfinished game.

775
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,146
Speaker 0: You should probably just not play in the beta and wait for the real game to come out.

776
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:01,234
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter They need that shit in there.

777
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:03,101
Speaker 0: Why Starcraft is gonna sell like crazy.

778
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:03,823
Speaker 0: They don't need that.

779
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:05,670
Speaker 0: Just what would it do for them?

780
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,235
Speaker 0: What would it do for anyone?

781
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:08,643
Speaker 0: but you no one cares.

782
00:48:08,663 --> 00:48:10,312
Speaker 1: plenty of noobs out there Trust me.

783
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,702
Speaker 1: who would very much like a tutorial but they're gonna buy the game.

784
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:13,325
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's.

785
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:14,430
Speaker 1: no they already bought the game.

786
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,992
Speaker 1: It doesn't think about.

787
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:16,257
Speaker 1: they would sell a lot more.

788
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:21,634
Speaker 0: I Highly doubt.

789
00:48:21,854 --> 00:48:30,682
Speaker 0: having a tutorial in the beta that you only get into if you were an alpha tester or if you bought the game Already is somehow going to cause more people to buy the game.

790
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,690
Speaker 1: Okay, take this example, right?

791
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,469
Speaker 1: Okay, so look at let's say Heroes of Newerth, right?

792
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,077
Speaker 1: That's the beta did not have a tutorial.

793
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:45,579
Speaker 1: if the beta had a proper tutorial that actually taught The purpose of the beta test is not.

794
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,983
Speaker 0: I mean some people conflated.

795
00:48:47,003 --> 00:48:52,669
Speaker 0: some people use the beta test when they're making game Also as a marketing tool to get the word out and get newbies in.

796
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:58,729
Speaker 0: But the primary purpose of a beta test is still to make sure game mechanics work and to test basic functionality.

797
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:07,170
Speaker 1: Yes Okay, so if you have a tutorial and someone actually knows how your game is supposed to work Then they'll actually be able to tell you when something's not working.

798
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:15,209
Speaker 1: Someone who has no idea what the what the fuck if it's even broken or it doesn't know how to play Will be incapable of telling you what's working and what doesn't work.

799
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,327
Speaker 1: You need to teach them how it's supposed to be in order for them to tell you.

800
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:22,542
Speaker 0: if it's not correct depends on what kind of beta testing you're doing and what you're looking for.

801
00:49:22,603 --> 00:49:23,185
Speaker 0: and you also.

802
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:28,550
Speaker 0: part of the thing is watch how People play see what trouble they have and then use that to tailor the tutorial.

803
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:29,173
Speaker 1: They don't.

804
00:49:29,193 --> 00:49:30,802
Speaker 1: you can't watch how people play though.

805
00:49:30,882 --> 00:49:33,414
Speaker 1: All they can do is send in bug reports They don't have like.

806
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:37,830
Speaker 1: the only people they have they watch play are the physical testers that are there at their offices.

807
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:39,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they probably did a lot of that testing there.

808
00:49:39,922 --> 00:49:41,310
Speaker 0: They don't need this extra feedback.

809
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:46,270
Speaker 0: I just I don't think the tutorial is that high on the purveyors or a beta is the number one thing?

810
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:47,856
Speaker 0: of Newark.

811
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:56,270
Speaker 0: that is the game aimed at people who already played dota and Noobs, but you don't really aim a beta at noobs unless you're doing a very specific marketing strategy.

812
00:49:56,553 --> 00:49:58,390
Speaker 0: You aim the finished product at the noobs.

813
00:49:58,651 --> 00:49:59,313
Speaker 1: I think about this.

814
00:49:59,453 --> 00:50:07,460
Speaker 1: if they had the tutorial if they had the beta aimed at the noobs and they actually gave a tutorial To the noobs right the noobs would not be.

815
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,870
Speaker 1: plus that was even worse right than the Starcraft one because that was a free beta.

816
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:12,581
Speaker 1: Right, so you get these people.

817
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:16,459
Speaker 1: they're playing this free beta Which is basically even better than the demo don't.

818
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:20,620
Speaker 1: and then because you didn't give them a tutorial they turned away And they're just like oh fuck this.

819
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,609
Speaker 1: and then they don't buy it.

820
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,453
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

821
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:25,788
Speaker 0: here's of Newark is a terrible example because it was aimed at a specific group of people.

822
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:28,252
Speaker 0: someone gets Free Scott.

823
00:50:28,312 --> 00:50:32,123
Speaker 0: it was also handled horribly and is a horrible game with a horrible can.

824
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,934
Speaker 1: so someone gets the Starcraft demo for the beta For free.

825
00:50:34,954 --> 00:50:35,600
Speaker 0: got it for free?

826
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:36,488
Speaker 1: some some noob.

827
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:37,877
Speaker 0: Why would they get it for free?

828
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:39,325
Speaker 1: because you can just sign up and get it.

829
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:40,070
Speaker 0: yeah.

830
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:41,158
Speaker 1: So he signs up.

831
00:50:41,198 --> 00:50:42,507
Speaker 1: he gets to the Starcraft 2 beta.

832
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:44,195
Speaker 1: all right No tutorial and there's no help.

833
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:45,902
Speaker 1: and now he doesn't know how to play.

834
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:46,685
Speaker 1: he plays.

835
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:47,850
Speaker 1: He just gets his ass kicked.

836
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:48,800
Speaker 1: He doesn't know what's going on.

837
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,569
Speaker 1: He says I'll fuck this now He never buys it whereas if you had given him a tutorial he would have learned the game Maybe learn to like it and eventually bought it.

838
00:50:56,112 --> 00:51:02,196
Speaker 0: But at the same time they're gonna make so many sales from people who will buy the game anyway that there's probably not worth it To spend the early resources.

839
00:51:02,316 --> 00:51:04,163
Speaker 1: are they gonna make a tutorial anyway?

840
00:51:04,303 --> 00:51:06,090
Speaker 1: probably then you should make it first.

841
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:07,817
Speaker 0: I think that's stupid.

842
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:08,681
Speaker 0: You're not stupid.

843
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:10,950
Speaker 0: fundamental changes to the game in the course of develop.

844
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,540
Speaker 0: So you change a tutorial.

845
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:13,970
Speaker 0: why waste the effort?

846
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,090
Speaker 0: I don't think you're vastly overestimating the value of a tutorial.

847
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,630
Speaker 0: I think you're vastly under estimating the value of a tutorial especially in a closed beta.

848
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:27,270
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be giving noobs your beta if you're gonna unless you're beta testing the experience of completely you know unknown.

849
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,939
Speaker 1: That's the number one people you should be getting the experience of.

850
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,685
Speaker 1: is the is the noobs who you know?

851
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:39,290
Speaker 1: if Nintendo has proved anything It's that appealing to the noobs and the people don't know what the fuck They're doing gets you 10 billion times more sales than appealing to the nerds.

852
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,438
Speaker 0: Stupidly simplistic view of the game development process.

853
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:44,665
Speaker 0: the the the aspect of like.

854
00:51:44,966 --> 00:51:45,046
Speaker 0: well.

855
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:46,290
Speaker 0: How do you teach a new player to play?

856
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,217
Speaker 0: What's the tutorial?

857
00:51:47,277 --> 00:51:48,730
Speaker 0: What's the learning curve in the beginning?

858
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:56,670
Speaker 0: You know all that stuff you track and test separately from basic beta testing like bugs and multiplayer and bet game balance.

859
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:02,767
Speaker 0: So why I don't think there's any reason to prioritize the former or for the latter because the latter fails.

860
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:04,012
Speaker 0: the game fails no matter What.

861
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:07,570
Speaker 0: if the former fails at most you lose the water to people?

862
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,557
Speaker 1: The people who come in.

863
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,550
Speaker 1: I think I think you're underestimating how many noobs are in the beta.

864
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:15,806
Speaker 1: I think you're overestimating the number of highly skilled people.

865
00:52:15,826 --> 00:52:19,017
Speaker 0: right and Yeah, it depends on the game for one.

866
00:52:19,037 --> 00:52:23,390
Speaker 0: Starcraft is going to sell to so many people if a game is not complicated enough.

867
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:27,864
Speaker 0: right got Starcraft could have no to no instructions and no tutorial.

868
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:32,259
Speaker 0: when it really releases and Still make tons of money and sell them it

869
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:42,512
Speaker 1: would make it made make sell a pittance compared to something like World of Warcraft Right which they probably make a bajillion times more money on because it's easy and the tutorial and any moron can play it Right.

870
00:52:42,532 --> 00:52:44,281
Speaker 1: that is what the gate in Farmville.

871
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:45,910
Speaker 1: any moron can play this tutorial.

872
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,036
Speaker 1: It's easy Starcraft hard.

873
00:52:48,116 --> 00:52:52,849
Speaker 1: I think Starcraft sales are actually going to be quite disappointing if they don't make it a lot fucking easier.

874
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,402
Speaker 0: I Disagree with that compared to the potential.

875
00:52:56,523 --> 00:53:03,770
Speaker 1: if they had made it all compared to a made-up Potential that you're making up in a potential of World of Warcraft or Farmville it would sell millions and millions of copies.

876
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,758
Speaker 0: But is it compared to the size of my penis?

877
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:07,265
Speaker 0: I can just make stuff up like you're doing.

878
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,690
Speaker 1: I Think the evidence is clear.

879
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:10,774
Speaker 1: Games games.

880
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:15,735
Speaker 1: you look at the track record of the games that have sold in recent history And how many they have sold.

881
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:19,010
Speaker 1: easy games games tutorials games that anymore?

882
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,008
Speaker 0: there's a difference between an easy game and a game with a tutorial.

883
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:26,430
Speaker 0: and You're still forgetting the fact that we're talking about Finnish games there versus beta tests.

884
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,277
Speaker 0: They're very very different worlds.

885
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:31,349
Speaker 1: the more accessible a game is the more it will sell.

886
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:38,750
Speaker 0: The game is not accessible, but it doesn't necessarily need to be polishedly accessible in alpha and beta testing.

887
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:43,210
Speaker 1: Yes It does because you're gonna want to test if you're looking to pick up the people.

888
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:49,150
Speaker 1: Right if you want to get the big sales you need to appeal to not the hard core But to the other people and depends on your game.

889
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,703
Speaker 1: You can't test for those people if they're not playing and those people can't play.

890
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,570
Speaker 1: and there's no to get your oversimplifying.

891
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,598
Speaker 0: I mean you can have an open beta versus up close beta.

892
00:53:56,658 --> 00:54:00,995
Speaker 0: most products will have different phases of the beta like the only reason They have phases of the beta.

893
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:02,983
Speaker 1: you don't want to know why they have phases of beta.

894
00:54:03,084 --> 00:54:04,730
Speaker 0: some people do it for marketing reasons.

895
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:08,583
Speaker 1: No, there's only one reason that anyone does betas and phases and the reason is this.

896
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:10,470
Speaker 1: you do beta phase one, right?

897
00:54:10,972 --> 00:54:13,705
Speaker 1: Everybody reports the one bug the same exact bug.

898
00:54:13,986 --> 00:54:14,589
Speaker 1: you fix it.

899
00:54:14,996 --> 00:54:20,587
Speaker 1: Okay If you don't have another phase of the beta none of those people usually most people report one bug.

900
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:22,819
Speaker 0: if they report any bug What do you have any evidence of this?

901
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,400
Speaker 0: because I'm at beta test a lot of games I report a shit ton of you're the only one.

902
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,710
Speaker 1: go look at and go look online for like statistics.

903
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,750
Speaker 1: There's plenty of people talking about their beta tests and then the statistics.

904
00:54:33,435 --> 00:54:34,664
Speaker 0: For me some guy on the internet.

905
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,288
Speaker 1: It's not some guy.

906
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:41,670
Speaker 1: in the Well known beta testing, you know statistics and everything straight up don't believe you?

907
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:42,369
Speaker 1: Well, that's fine.

908
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,600
Speaker 1: But the truth of the matter is we do a beta test.

909
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,990
Speaker 1: the vast majority of people report zero bugs.

910
00:54:47,312 --> 00:54:50,729
Speaker 1: People who do report a bug report like the first bug they come across and that's it.

911
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:55,030
Speaker 1: So you do phases of the beta because that way the people sign up they're in phase one.

912
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:58,163
Speaker 1: They report the one bug in phase one that they all know.

913
00:54:58,223 --> 00:54:59,850
Speaker 0: one example the old MMO the realm.

914
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:07,517
Speaker 1: If you don't have a phase two or more people those people will just stop playing or they won't report another bug Ever again, so you need a phase two.

915
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:11,330
Speaker 1: all these new people come in when now that first bug is fixed.

916
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:13,148
Speaker 1: So now they discover the new bugs.

917
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:28,952
Speaker 0: They made a new like vert like they're making a new version of the game and they open up the first day of the alpha Testing and they all they started you know, they'd like did many many many phases of the alpha and then the beta and Each phase.

918
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:29,474
Speaker 0: they were kind of.

919
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:45,510
Speaker 0: they started with the hardcore players and the developers and people like that to work out kinks and game Balance and then they brought in, you know a wider swatch But still only the kind of experienced players who didn't need any hand-holding and guidance just to get the game polished after all that.

920
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:48,630
Speaker 0: Then they set up tutorials and all those sorts of things.

921
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,705
Speaker 0: Then they open the beta up to pretty much anyone in the already had an account.

922
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:54,170
Speaker 0: who wanted to do the beta and how many?

923
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,596
Speaker 1: People did they sell this game to Back then comparatively.

924
00:55:57,636 --> 00:55:58,398
Speaker 0: I don't know offhand.

925
00:55:58,659 --> 00:55:58,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

926
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:01,550
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many do the really easy moron game?

927
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:07,848
Speaker 1: But Scott Farville loses millions of players and they're just like, okay, we still have millions millions more.

928
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,196
Speaker 1: so your base It's a moron.

929
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:10,608
Speaker 0: So you're gonna just completely come.

930
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:12,160
Speaker 1: no I'm saying is you know?

931
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:19,410
Speaker 1: because the thing is when I Suggested right that they should have a tutorial the only argument not in the beta The only are you first thing in the bay?

932
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:24,850
Speaker 1: The reason the reason you gave for they shouldn't have it is that there is no financial incentive.

933
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,980
Speaker 0: No, I said that's a reason why they do.

934
00:56:27,181 --> 00:56:28,326
Speaker 0: that was just a secondary.

935
00:56:28,387 --> 00:56:29,915
Speaker 0: like they don't need it They'll sell just fine.

936
00:56:29,976 --> 00:56:32,110
Speaker 1: Anyway, the real but they won't sell just fine.

937
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,337
Speaker 1: Anyway, easy moron games sell more.

938
00:56:34,397 --> 00:56:41,664
Speaker 1: tutorials make the game easier and more accessible and will increase sales Vastly, there is a huge financial incentive to have this guy.

939
00:56:41,744 --> 00:56:43,090
Speaker 0: I'm talking just about Starcraft.

940
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:44,950
Speaker 0: I don't think a tutorial make the game sell anymore.

941
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:46,817
Speaker 1: I think a tutorial make the game sell a lot more.

942
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:57,090
Speaker 0: but that aside my main the only issue I take that you're taking this weird position on is that Prioritizing the tutorial as the first thing in your alpha and beta testing is ludicrous.

943
00:56:57,673 --> 00:56:58,557
Speaker 1: Why is it ludicrous?

944
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:00,968
Speaker 0: for all the reasons I said for the last 20 minutes.

945
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,855
Speaker 1: Tutorial is the app you cannot.

946
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:06,082
Speaker 1: I think you can't even have a game without a tutorial.

947
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:09,938
Speaker 1: don't even let anyone play unless there's instructions In tutorial, okay.

948
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:12,331
Speaker 0: I disagree with you 100%.

949
00:57:12,331 --> 00:57:15,163
Speaker 1: Well shows that I will see how well your game sells.

950
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,489
Speaker 0: What about your game?

951
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,599
Speaker 0: Why are you even doing anything in project?

952
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,749
Speaker 0: or if you need a tutorial because there's nothing you can't play it.

953
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:25,075
Speaker 0: yet There's something there.

954
00:57:25,115 --> 00:57:28,350
Speaker 1: you don't have a tutorial because it's not a game that we've given to anyone.

955
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:33,877
Speaker 1: So when you get what point are you gonna make the tutorial when we say hey, this game is playable There will be a tutorial.

956
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,109
Speaker 0: so you're so when you do the beta test.

957
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:45,360
Speaker 0: Hmm as opposed to the alpha like you're gonna I don't think you just have any idea of how game development actually works because this is first of all This is an open-source game with that doesn't have any direction.

958
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,545
Speaker 0: So it's an exception.

959
00:57:46,565 --> 00:57:47,750
Speaker 0: We don't need a tutorial right away.

960
00:57:49,072 --> 00:57:51,583
Speaker 1: You can't even make a tutorial when there's no game to tutorial.

961
00:57:51,824 --> 00:57:53,130
Speaker 0: All right, so when are you gonna make the tutorial?

962
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,095
Speaker 1: There's a game.

963
00:57:54,155 --> 00:58:00,683
Speaker 0: that's got to be the first thing you do as soon as the game is in any way playable Before anyone says here come play this game.

964
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:02,570
Speaker 1: There will be a tutorial and instructions.

965
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:11,308
Speaker 0: Alright, I just I think Prioritizing tutorial above other more basic beta testing is a poor way to go about beta testing.

966
00:58:11,348 --> 00:58:11,950
Speaker 0: a large game.

967
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,378
Speaker 1: You don't you know, you're not understanding.

968
00:58:14,398 --> 00:58:20,578
Speaker 1: what I'm saying is you don't hand out the game to people and say hey play Instructions, I mean who do you hand it out to?

969
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:32,350
Speaker 0: a lot of people do a very closed alpha and then a very closed beta And then they open up the beta more and more as the game gets more polished and they add more of the new friendly stuff As they get to the point where they want to introduce noobs to the more polished game.

970
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:37,786
Speaker 0: They only want hardcore people testing the shitty version of the game because hardcore people understand that it's a beta.

971
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:40,176
Speaker 0: new people show them Any beta of any game.

972
00:58:40,438 --> 00:58:42,348
Speaker 0: they'll say what the fuck is this and never play the game again?

973
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:45,457
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's talk about RTS.

974
00:58:45,477 --> 00:58:47,784
Speaker 1: is we already have kind of mostly?

975
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:49,329
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know.

976
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:51,298
Speaker 1: Is there anything left to say about RTS?

977
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:53,730
Speaker 1: is that we haven't said you segue back to nothing?

978
00:58:54,290 --> 00:59:04,350
Speaker 1: Well because you turned my minor point into a huge tangent taking up the entire show Because for some reason you think it's moronic to have a tutorial and to make more money by making a game.

979
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:09,930
Speaker 0: Tutorials are great in Finnish games, but they shouldn't be prioritized at the top of the queue in the beta test.

980
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:16,510
Speaker 1: I think that you just shouldn't put out a game any of any kind bored video RPG of any kind.

981
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:21,876
Speaker 1: You should not hand it to people and say play this whether it's beta Anyone in the world you should.

982
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:26,330
Speaker 1: you should not make your game, you know and tell people play this.

983
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:29,370
Speaker 1: There are no instructions or tutorials.

984
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:46,983
Speaker 0: I mean one things about one thing you do in like HCI when you're developing interfaces for things, you know non games for example is You bring people in off the street and do basically Close betas with no tutorial just to see how they flounder and then use that as guidance to make better Interfaces and to change things in.

985
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:47,910
Speaker 0: whatever it is you're building.

986
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:52,810
Speaker 1: That's not that's user interface - it's a completely different thing.

987
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,255
Speaker 1: That's like having a focus group.

988
00:59:54,275 --> 01:00:01,389
Speaker 1: you can come in with a focus group and ask people questions about what kind of game For game development, that's what they do.

989
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:11,815
Speaker 0: They'll have like an in-house beta not even a closed beta where they give out keys But a beta where you can only play the game if you're there and they watch you play it and they ask you shit about It while you're playing it, you know what.

990
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:20,284
Speaker 1: I would like to point out right that the perhaps most successful Right software and you know design and development companies in the universe.

991
01:00:20,304 --> 01:00:22,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Apple Nintendo Etc.

992
01:00:23,355 --> 01:00:24,258
Speaker 1: No focus groups.

993
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,363
Speaker 1: No betas.

994
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,150
Speaker 1: No nothing, right?

995
01:00:27,431 --> 01:00:30,562
Speaker 0: You're a hundred percent sure that Microsoft doesn't test beta.

996
01:00:30,622 --> 01:00:31,605
Speaker 1: I didn't say Microsoft.

997
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:32,890
Speaker 1: Microsoft sucks at design.

998
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:34,996
Speaker 0: So Apple doesn't test interfaces.

999
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:37,161
Speaker 1: No focus groups whatsoever zero.

1000
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:38,565
Speaker 1: So what they don't beta?

1001
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:40,410
Speaker 1: test anything to the sky ever.

1002
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:42,563
Speaker 0: Uh, I didn't say to the public.

1003
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:43,810
Speaker 0: you said no beta test at all.

1004
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:51,439
Speaker 0: They beta test but the only difference is they hire people to do the beta testing rather than bringing in people off the street And then making they don't hire people to do the testing.

1005
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:52,664
Speaker 1: They already have the people.

1006
01:00:52,704 --> 01:00:54,310
Speaker 1: it's the people that are already there Scott.

1007
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,037
Speaker 0: That's a stupid pedantic distinction.

1008
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:57,041
Speaker 1: That is a very important.

1009
01:00:57,061 --> 01:00:57,743
Speaker 0: They've hired.

1010
01:00:57,763 --> 01:00:59,510
Speaker 0: They have people on staff to do the testing.

1011
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,421
Speaker 1: No They're the same people who are or making the thing.

1012
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:02,903
Speaker 0: actually.

1013
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:07,922
Speaker 0: that is against all Principle of HCI is having the same people who designed something tested.

1014
01:01:08,524 --> 01:01:09,427
Speaker 1: Yes, but you know what?

1015
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:10,310
Speaker 1: That's what Apple does.

1016
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:11,496
Speaker 0: I don't think that's what they do.

1017
01:01:11,556 --> 01:01:12,903
Speaker 0: and unless you cite some evidence.

1018
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:14,633
Speaker 0: I'm calling bullshit on that to go Look it up.

1019
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:16,222
Speaker 0: No, you you're the one who made the claim.

1020
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:17,610
Speaker 0: big cite your bullshit.

1021
01:01:17,911 --> 01:01:23,150
Speaker 1: I gotta go find the article but it talks about Apple's design process and basically they just have a Roman Apple employees.

1022
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,517
Speaker 0: It's certified as being legit.

1023
01:01:24,558 --> 01:01:25,684
Speaker 0: or is this just some like?

1024
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:26,790
Speaker 1: yeah, they're books.

1025
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:34,170
Speaker 1: They're pretty much you can say Apple so secretive, but they're books about Apple And basically it's just a bunch of geniuses and they just do it and then they hope they release it when it's done.

1026
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:37,990
Speaker 0: Uh-huh with zero internal testing from non designers whatsoever.

1027
01:01:39,756 --> 01:01:43,301
Speaker 0: It's the people Highly doubt that and I think you're full of shit.

1028
01:01:43,342 --> 01:01:44,890
Speaker 1: The point is they don't do beta tests.

1029
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,436
Speaker 1: They don't have anything without instructions.

1030
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:48,784
Speaker 1: They don't have anything without a tutorial Nintendo, right?

1031
01:01:49,246 --> 01:01:49,567
Speaker 1: Nothing's.

1032
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:50,450
Speaker 1: open everything.

1033
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,278
Speaker 1: They do on their own Scott and you want.

1034
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:53,603
Speaker 0: so what's their internal process?

1035
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,270
Speaker 0: because they do have beta testers.

1036
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,079
Speaker 0: They have closed betas on things internally.

1037
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,445
Speaker 0: Why do you think they get all those special?

1038
01:01:58,485 --> 01:01:59,430
Speaker 0: Thanks on some of the games?

1039
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,288
Speaker 0: They've made in the past?

1040
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:03,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but they so they do what you just said.

1041
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:04,242
Speaker 0: they don't.

1042
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,290
Speaker 1: everything has instructions and a tutorial.

1043
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,883
Speaker 0: How do you know what they gave those original beta testers?

1044
01:02:09,265 --> 01:02:10,150
Speaker 1: Everything has instructions.

1045
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:16,298
Speaker 0: You're just making shit up Enough with your tangents, right?

1046
01:02:16,418 --> 01:02:19,410
Speaker 1: Oh someone says here that they saw the documentary and it's true.

1047
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,212
Speaker 1: They saw the same thing.

1048
01:02:20,293 --> 01:02:20,573
Speaker 1: I did.

1049
01:02:20,734 --> 01:02:25,207
Speaker 1: Apple does no betas and they have designed better than anybody.

1050
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:29,563
Speaker 1: They're the best Right, so don't be you know, these people doing this thing.

1051
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:30,005
Speaker 1: That's all.

1052
01:02:30,025 --> 01:02:30,687
Speaker 1: that's against the stand.

1053
01:02:30,707 --> 01:02:31,330
Speaker 1: They're doing it wrong.

1054
01:02:31,692 --> 01:02:32,257
Speaker 0: I'm small.

1055
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:33,910
Speaker 0: I was saying was that internal Apple?

1056
01:02:34,253 --> 01:02:35,040
Speaker 0: How do you know that?

1057
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,049
Speaker 0: you know person, you know?

1058
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:43,259
Speaker 0: Engineering team designs their face that at some point they don't have someone who is not a member of that engineering team Specifically test the.

1059
01:02:43,299 --> 01:02:45,150
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter because that's what I was saying.

1060
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:49,078
Speaker 1: All because the original argument is about tutorials.

1061
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,926
Speaker 1: right and the fact is is the Apple the best?

1062
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:56,139
Speaker 1: no one comes even close Blizzard not doing things the way.

1063
01:02:56,259 --> 01:02:59,330
Speaker 1: Apple does therefore not as good they should do it.

1064
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:07,540
Speaker 1: Everyone should do things the way the people who are doing it the best are which is tutorials Easy instructions making things more accessible.

1065
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:08,544
Speaker 1: Those are the priorities.

1066
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,070
Speaker 1: That's what gets you bigger sales.

1067
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:15,110
Speaker 1: Look at all the things that have come out in recent history the accessible easy thing.

1068
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:16,903
Speaker 0: So then why make a difficult game?

1069
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:17,850
Speaker 0: why make a game?

1070
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,233
Speaker 0: That's hard because by definition very difficult games become Inaccessible.

1071
01:03:21,374 --> 01:03:26,842
Speaker 1: if I was a big company trying to make money like a public company like Blizzard I wouldn't if I my goal was money.

1072
01:03:26,922 --> 01:03:28,310
Speaker 1: I would not make any hard games ever.

1073
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:30,629
Speaker 1: Okay, so my goal was to make awesome games.

1074
01:03:31,331 --> 01:03:34,830
Speaker 1: Then I would make a hard game because I like but then you're gonna violate all this stuff you just said.

1075
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:37,530
Speaker 0: So what if Blizzard's just trying to make a good game with Starcraft?

1076
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,977
Speaker 1: They're just trying to make a hard game.

1077
01:03:39,098 --> 01:03:45,486
Speaker 1: I would still haven't struggles as an easy time But I wouldn't prioritize that as the first thing I would because I if I am I still.

1078
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:48,390
Speaker 1: am I trying to make any money At all or am I doing it as like a labor of life?

1079
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:48,791
Speaker 0: I have.

1080
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:54,436
Speaker 0: I highly doubt that the experiences in the beta test are going to in any way negatively impact the sales of a large game like that.

1081
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:58,545
Speaker 1: I Think that they impact the sales a lot more than you think.

1082
01:03:58,566 --> 01:03:59,169
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

1083
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,301
Speaker 0: Well, you think we're especially not for Starcraft.

1084
01:04:01,662 --> 01:04:03,110
Speaker 1: I think for Starcraft definitely.

1085
01:04:03,951 --> 01:04:05,196
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people right.

1086
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,550
Speaker 1: they sign up for betas because they're the same poor kids who want to pirate the game.

1087
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:14,934
Speaker 1: They just want to play for free before it comes out and then if they don't like that's a bad experience We're gonna buy the game.

1088
01:04:14,995 --> 01:04:16,239
Speaker 0: Anyway, they're gonna pirate it.

1089
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:17,061
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

1090
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:19,730
Speaker 1: Those are people right if they had their.

1091
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,336
Speaker 1: Basically, it's like a demo for them.

1092
01:04:22,456 --> 01:04:26,690
Speaker 1: Right and if they have a bad experience, they're not even gonna pirate the game.

1093
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:28,309
Speaker 1: They're never gonna play it ever again.

1094
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:31,245
Speaker 1: And if they have a good experience then they're gonna pirate it.

1095
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:32,692
Speaker 0: you make no money either way They can't.

1096
01:04:32,752 --> 01:04:35,384
Speaker 1: but the thing is Starcraft has like the whole battle net thing.

1097
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:41,910
Speaker 0: So they're gonna pay for it Scott I know but several of my co-workers have the pre beta that they already pirated and play against each other all the time.

1098
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:48,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the beta that they can play against the Pirate the new one and crack it.

1099
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,361
Speaker 0: Maybe they can't use battle net.

1100
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:50,386
Speaker 0: They'll still play against each other.

1101
01:04:50,406 --> 01:04:51,089
Speaker 0: That's all they care about.

1102
01:04:52,272 --> 01:04:53,401
Speaker 1: Then they weren't gonna buy the game.

1103
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:56,296
Speaker 0: Anyway, exactly matters We don't care about them, but they're not.

1104
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:59,506
Speaker 1: are there if they're pirating the game though to play against each other.

1105
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,490
Speaker 1: They're not the noobs.

1106
01:05:01,571 --> 01:05:08,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I just think it's a silly design methodology to put a tutorial above every single other thing in your closed beta test.

1107
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:09,950
Speaker 1: So you don't put it above?

1108
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:14,009
Speaker 1: No, I said you absolutely have to have one before you go.

1109
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:16,939
Speaker 0: Wait, I actually have to have one before you start the beta.

1110
01:05:17,401 --> 01:05:20,009
Speaker 0: Yes, then you prioritize it above everything else in the beta.

1111
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,236
Speaker 1: Not necessarily.

1112
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:24,269
Speaker 1: You need to have the game in there, too.

1113
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:25,313
Speaker 0: I have the tutorial.

1114
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:28,203
Speaker 1: absolutely must have the tutorial and the game in the beta.

1115
01:05:28,243 --> 01:05:29,247
Speaker 0: how much of the tutorial?

1116
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:31,254
Speaker 0: so the tutorial says play The game because I didn't finish it yet.

1117
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:31,876
Speaker 0: It's still in beta.

1118
01:05:31,896 --> 01:05:33,180
Speaker 0: Does that count?

1119
01:05:33,381 --> 01:05:35,950
Speaker 1: the tutorial needs to teach you how to play the game.

1120
01:05:37,232 --> 01:05:40,330
Speaker 1: It might have bugs in it because it's beta but it has to be in there.

1121
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:42,140
Speaker 1: So does the game also has to be in there.

1122
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,728
Speaker 1: the options menu also has to be.

1123
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:47,510
Speaker 0: you know When I play the a lot of things have to be in when I play the alpha of the realm.

1124
01:05:47,631 --> 01:05:50,070
Speaker 0: Just another example because that was the longest beta I was ever in.

1125
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:51,071
Speaker 0: The.

1126
01:05:51,192 --> 01:05:54,261
Speaker 0: the first alpha release did not even have characters.

1127
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:57,010
Speaker 0: You were just basically blob sprites walking around.

1128
01:05:57,951 --> 01:06:00,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, you shouldn't be releasing something to beta if you don't.

1129
01:06:01,431 --> 01:06:02,254
Speaker 0: Yet that was alpha.

1130
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:02,695
Speaker 0: that was yeah.

1131
01:06:02,756 --> 01:06:03,960
Speaker 1: alphas are not for the public.

1132
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:04,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1133
01:06:04,603 --> 01:06:06,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it was just for the hardcore people there.

1134
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,688
Speaker 1: they were doing it wrong and That's why they're dead now.

1135
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:15,273
Speaker 0: I think they're dead now because they were the first MMO and all the MMOs that came out from that time died at about the Same time.

1136
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:20,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, if Blizzard though had made the first demo in his World of Warcraft It would be where it is now be even bigger than it is now.

1137
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:24,042
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is that would have been impossible with technology back then.

1138
01:06:24,123 --> 01:06:25,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it would have looked like Warcraft.

1139
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:28,201
Speaker 0: one Thing is they made it back then.

1140
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:29,150
Speaker 0: I think it still would have died.

1141
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:33,415
Speaker 0: They would have made another more polished version of World of Warcraft later because back then well That's what they've been doing right.

1142
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:36,168
Speaker 0: back then the only people who played MMOs were hardcore gamers.

1143
01:06:36,328 --> 01:06:36,670
Speaker 0: already.

1144
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:39,581
Speaker 0: There was no casual market for stuff back then like that.

1145
01:06:39,882 --> 01:06:42,010
Speaker 0: PC gaming was this kind of niche area.

1146
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:44,190
Speaker 1: The thing is I think the casual market did exist.

1147
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:47,570
Speaker 1: It was just no one made the casual game to actually open it up.

1148
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,098
Speaker 1: So not a single case back then.

1149
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:51,170
Speaker 0: just that the amount of PC ownership was low.

1150
01:06:51,471 --> 01:06:55,470
Speaker 1: No, but all those people were still playing solitaire waiting for a different game.

1151
01:06:56,074 --> 01:06:59,077
Speaker 1: All those people were playing Tetris waiting for a different game I'm pretty sure.

1152
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:02,744
Speaker 0: all the people who played solitaire However, never moved on to playing anything but solitaire.

1153
01:07:02,764 --> 01:07:03,810
Speaker 0: because I see people to this day.

1154
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,696
Speaker 1: Those people are playing Farmville now.

1155
01:07:05,837 --> 01:07:09,750
Speaker 1: They're playing Farmville and they're playing Bejeweled and they're playing World of Warcraft.

1156
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,505
Speaker 0: I think Bejeweled is still like ten leagues above things like Mafia Wars and Farmville.

1157
01:07:13,525 --> 01:07:14,067
Speaker 0: Those aren't games.

1158
01:07:14,087 --> 01:07:17,117
Speaker 1: Those are just Bejeweled is the same exact thing.

1159
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:20,126
Speaker 1: At least Bejeweled is not even as good as Tetris.

1160
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:21,370
Speaker 0: Of course not.

1161
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,722
Speaker 1: I mean Bejeweled isn't even at Sudoku levels.

1162
01:07:24,204 --> 01:07:27,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, what are you trying to say?

1163
01:07:27,138 --> 01:07:29,990
Speaker 1: I mean Bejeweled happens to actually be in World of Warcraft, right?

1164
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,074
Speaker 1: They actually did that?

1165
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,363
Speaker 1: That wasn't like an April Fool's joke.

1166
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:33,865
Speaker 1: That was real?

1167
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:34,407
Speaker 0: That was real.

1168
01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:37,173
Speaker 0: Okay I think we're done.

1169
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,001
Speaker 0: The moral of this, we suck ass at RTSs.

1170
01:07:40,282 --> 01:07:41,425
Speaker 0: We suck so much.

1171
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:47,430
Speaker 0: And when Starcraft comes out for legit We're gonna play against you listeners and you will really really laugh at us.

1172
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,430
Speaker 1: I've been playing, you know, a little bit.

1173
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:57,370
Speaker 1: I beat all I beat the I played five times in the practice and I played the Get ranked five games and I ranked really low.

1174
01:07:57,651 --> 01:07:58,875
Speaker 1: But I did win some of them.

1175
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:02,890
Speaker 1: because only because the one guy taught me I need to build a lot of SCVs.

1176
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,481
Speaker 1: But I have no instructions.

1177
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:11,272
Speaker 1: So if someone wants to send me instructions Like I don't know what I've been only playing Terran because I at least remember more of their stuff from Starcraft 1.

1178
01:08:11,272 --> 01:08:12,819
Speaker 1: But I don't know what half the units do like.

1179
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,068
Speaker 1: I don't even build like the ghosts cuz I don't know how they work.

1180
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:16,051
Speaker 1: and I Don't like.

1181
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:19,314
Speaker 1: I built a unit once like a whole bunch of them and I was like, oh, yeah I'm gonna win.

1182
01:08:19,354 --> 01:08:24,488
Speaker 1: now the unit couldn't attack the ground it was only air to air and I was like, oh shit, and I just lost.

1183
01:08:24,508 --> 01:08:26,795
Speaker 1: and You know cuz there were no instructions.

1184
01:08:27,397 --> 01:08:28,080
Speaker 1: So whatever.

1185
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:29,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a beta.

1186
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:29,385
Speaker 0: They're still.

1187
01:08:29,404 --> 01:08:30,649
Speaker 0: they're testing all sorts of other things.

1188
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:32,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, how about some instructions?

1189
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:36,529
Speaker 1: So if I gave me instructions, I'd be able to help them test and say we're not testing.

1190
01:08:36,671 --> 01:08:37,515
Speaker 1: I'm not testing the game.

1191
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:38,640
Speaker 1: I'm testing my stupidity.

1192
01:08:38,962 --> 01:08:40,309
Speaker 0: See I haven't looked for instructions.

1193
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:42,060
Speaker 0: Yes I don't know if they're out there or not because I haven't.

1194
01:08:42,182 --> 01:08:43,410
Speaker 0: I just haven't bothered looking for him.

1195
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:44,861
Speaker 0: I just kind of figured the game out.

1196
01:08:44,881 --> 01:08:47,763
