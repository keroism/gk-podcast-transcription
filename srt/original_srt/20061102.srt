1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,155
Speaker 1: It's Thursday November 2nd.

2
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,923
Speaker 1: I'm Rem and I'm Scott and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:18,270
Speaker 1: Tonight with the upcoming US midterm elections We talk a little bit about politics.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,707
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,336
Speaker 1: Today I actually had some work to do.

6
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:28,670
Speaker 0: Oh my god, cuz I didn't have work to do and I left work early to go buy.

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,869
Speaker 0: Shit, we desperately needed and did not have an opportunity to go buy.

8
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:38,730
Speaker 1: Though by having work to do I ended up being in Mount Vernon today and I ended up being in an area that is Predominantly Hispanic.

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,221
Speaker 1: Now the interesting thing is I needed some food.

10
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,145
Speaker 1: So I just wander out.

11
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,430
Speaker 1: I'm looking for a deli or something.

12
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,135
Speaker 1: I see a deli.

13
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:48,213
Speaker 1: I just walk in stand in line get to the front I go to order.

14
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:51,989
Speaker 1: then I realize that I'm the only one in this place who speaks English.

15
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,479
Speaker 0: Oh my god, everything's in Spanish.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,899
Speaker 1: the menus in Spanish on the wall the Owners and employees.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,709
Speaker 1: none of them speak English at all.

18
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:05,447
Speaker 0: You know, I haven't, you know taken a Spanish class since high school.

19
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:07,124
Speaker 0: high school I took two years of Spanish.

20
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,630
Speaker 0: middle school.

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:22,050
Speaker 0: I took three years and since then not so much but I still find I can kind of read a Spanish newspaper I guess like a Spanish elementary school kid maybe and I probably could order food in a Spanish restaurant.

22
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:25,198
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's that's pretty interesting there.

23
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:25,439
Speaker 0: Yeah.

24
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:25,760
Speaker 1: Well, it was.

25
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:39,402
Speaker 1: it was interesting that no one spoke English at all Which is something I've never actually run into in this country before Where I went to a place of business and tried to conduct business and I was unable to Because the people owning the business did not speak my language.

26
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they guys speak English.

27
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,837
Speaker 0: I mean, I've never encountered some.

28
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:53,830
Speaker 0: I've encountered people who can't speak English at all but they're usually people directly from foreign countries like vacationing someone or You know someone from an older generation.

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,095
Speaker 1: Well, I have another little.

30
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,490
Speaker 1: I have a beef though before I get into what actually happened.

31
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,620
Speaker 1: Alright the the sign outside said it was a deli.

32
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,405
Speaker 1: I went in because I wanted to sub.

33
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:03,950
Speaker 1: it wasn't a deli.

34
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:15,850
Speaker 1: They only had like tacos and burritos awesome, so and I didn't want to walk out because that was awkward even though it's awkward enough that everyone's just kind of staring at Me and I'm obviously this guy.

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,770
Speaker 1: It doesn't speak the language and I didn't want to leave because I thought that would be rude.

36
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:35,030
Speaker 1: so eventually it turns out one of the other customers spoke enough English to Translate to the patron or the proprietor that I wanted a chicken burrito Which in the end was really really good and really really big and it was only like three bucks.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,355
Speaker 0: I imagine it would be.

38
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,137
Speaker 0: it was.

39
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:40,590
Speaker 1: it wasn't as good as the cafe Maya, but it was three bucks.

40
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,872
Speaker 1: I pay more than that for a slice of pizza and sometimes Great.

41
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:49,714
Speaker 1: All right, but then more much more interestingly I I work.

42
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:53,950
Speaker 1: I go to these two big hospitals to do a whole bunch of work and that you need diseases.

43
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:54,988
Speaker 1: I hope not.

44
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,458
Speaker 1: But though at one point I dropped a pen on the floor in one of these data Closets and the guy was like I go to reach it.

45
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,366
Speaker 1: the guy says don't pick anything up off the floor.

46
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,173
Speaker 1: Here's the new pen Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:06,926
Speaker 1: He's like don't touch the floor here.

48
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:10,708
Speaker 1: You'll get sick Wasn't the best hospital I was in?

49
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,050
Speaker 1: Okay, well at least the first hospital one was better.

50
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,653
Speaker 1: But the cool thing is while I was that I've never been in a not nice Hospital like.

51
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:21,827
Speaker 0: I went to a hospital once that looked not nice on the outside like outside the hospital.

52
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,570
Speaker 0: I was like, huh?

53
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,710
Speaker 0: This looks like a shady hospital, but inside it was nice hospital.

54
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,610
Speaker 0: I mean it was gone.

55
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,529
Speaker 1: It wasn't any dirtier than any other hospital that I've worked in.

56
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:30,951
Speaker 1: It's just.

57
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:36,070
Speaker 1: no one had ever specifically warned me against touching the floor before and I've been in operating rooms.

58
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:36,495
Speaker 1: Maybe

59
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,880
Speaker 0: that was just a scared, dude You know the kind of people are afraid of germs all the time or

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,965
Speaker 1: you might just been making a joke

61
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,575
Speaker 0: or maybe he's making A joke, but

62
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:51,929
Speaker 1: the point is while I was working I met a cool guy who you know I'm just making small talk while I'm doing my business and he's showing me around and Unlocking all these places I have to get into to do my business.

63
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,242
Speaker 1: And we're talking a bit about hobbies.

64
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:56,452
Speaker 1: and I mentioned yeah, blah blah blah Convention.

65
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:59,963
Speaker 1: whenever I talk about my hobbies most people in the world.

66
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:04,828
Speaker 1: I interact with in my job Do not understand geekery at all.

67
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:17,236
Speaker 1: So when I say like normally if I meet someone I'm cool, I'll be like, yeah I was just at an anime con or yeah, I do a podcast but to normal muggles I say things like yeah I speak at Japanese muggles.

68
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:17,577
Speaker 0: Yes.

69
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,279
Speaker 1: I said muggles.

70
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:19,704
Speaker 1: I speak it.

71
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:31,209
Speaker 1: nor I speak at a Japanese cultural or Japanese film Conventions or Japanese film and animation things and I do an internet radio show or something like that.

72
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:39,381
Speaker 1: but I mentioned blah blah blah Japanese blah and the guys like Like Katsu Kanon Otakon ride and all that and we start talking.

73
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,330
Speaker 1: He's kind of an anime fan and he wants to start a podcast.

74
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,637
Speaker 0: What kind of other hobbies did he have?

75
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:45,821
Speaker 1: We talked a bit.

76
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:46,744
Speaker 1: He's into computers.

77
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:47,948
Speaker 1: No, he's an IT guy.

78
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:48,570
Speaker 1: He knows a lot.

79
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,909
Speaker 1: He doesn't isn't so big in Linux, but he wants to be.

80
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:53,638
Speaker 0: Where does it live?

81
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:54,969
Speaker 1: somewhere in the city?

82
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,950
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna tell this guy's life story on the show.

83
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:12,105
Speaker 1: I just thought it was cool that perhaps the for the first time in many years of employment I met another geek in the course of my work No a geek who seemed to know what he was talking about about technology.

84
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,945
Speaker 1: because most of the people I end up Meeting in my work don't really know much about what the job is.

85
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:17,910
Speaker 1: They're supposed to be doing.

86
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:18,934
Speaker 0: That's just what it is.

87
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:22,730
Speaker 0: Like as these old people go out, you know, then we're just we're on the edge.

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,190
Speaker 0: We're the young people coming in who know what we're talking about.

89
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,982
Speaker 0: And we just got a more of us got to get in there.

90
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:32,178
Speaker 0: because yeah, many of us are Knowing but not getting jobs.

91
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,643
Speaker 0: They're just being bums.

92
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,589
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people being bummed.

93
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:36,295
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, we do.

94
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:42,749
Speaker 0: we could call them out by name Yeah Go get jobs so that we can infiltrate the workforce faster and get rid of the old.

95
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:59,789
Speaker 1: more Importantly to all of you out there who are friends of mine who are good at technology particularly computers I Get a pile of money if you work for my company and you also get a pile of money and by a pile I mean multiple thousands, so I want that money.

96
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:05,790
Speaker 0: That's all I got to say rim not yet wealthy enough to say himself.

97
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:10,230
Speaker 1: No, no, the thing is I get almost everything I want out of life.

98
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,478
Speaker 1: I don't need much more money to live a perfect life.

99
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:18,030
Speaker 1: And if I didn't have my school debt, which is rapidly going away I'd be living in luxury as far as I'm concerned.

100
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:25,099
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I could always do with more money But the thing is to improve my life I would need so much more money.

101
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,410
Speaker 0: like it used to be I needed a house in a car.

102
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,574
Speaker 0: Well now I have a house in a car.

103
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,570
Speaker 0: So how much money more would it take to significantly improve my life?

104
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, the probably it would take like five hundred thousand dollars to buy a wicked house.

105
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,730
Speaker 0: I mean it said I don't get five hundred thousand dollars.

106
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,568
Speaker 0: I'm basically it doesn't change my life at all.

107
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:51,290
Speaker 1: The sad truth is that the next step to make us more happy in terms of you know money and physical Possessions and lifestyle would to be it to be to be independently wealthy.

108
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:54,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to remove the debt or remove the job somehow.

109
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:55,189
Speaker 0: Yeah.

110
00:06:56,497 --> 00:07:03,950
Speaker 1: So we can't be happier physically Unless we have independent wealth or like Ferraris and mansions and shit.

111
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:08,030
Speaker 0: But even then that doesn't make me that much happier compared to how much money it got.

112
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,530
Speaker 1: You know, what made me the most happy is being independently wealthy and having all that free time.

113
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:19,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the only real thing I could buy would be like vacations constantly just traveling around the world crazily Yeah, but I can't afford that with a job.

114
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:20,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

116
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:22,446
Speaker 1: Well, no I can afford it.

117
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,650
Speaker 1: I can't afford the time.

118
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:24,908
Speaker 0: Yeah that too.

119
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:31,638
Speaker 1: I mean we could Scott and I could right now just like go to the airport and fly to Greece and Then we can get back to.

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,947
Speaker 0: yeah, that's about it.

121
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,430
Speaker 0: It's like a thousand-something dollar plane ticket.

122
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:40,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can live there for a while too and we could pay off that debt pretty handily with Greek money.

123
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,996
Speaker 1: I'm not saying move to Greece.

124
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:45,582
Speaker 1: I'm saying fly there stay there.

125
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:46,807
Speaker 1: We fly back.

126
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:51,590
Speaker 0: Okay Work in Greece to pay off our American debt.

127
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:54,243
Speaker 1: We just go on a two-week vacation in Greece.

128
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,350
Speaker 1: on like my credit card.

129
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,278
Speaker 0: Did they use euros in Greece or something else?

130
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,423
Speaker 1: They're part of the EU.

131
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,150
Speaker 0: I think I gotta go check on that.

132
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:05,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta admit I haven't been paying attention to modern European politics, it's so weird.

133
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,558
Speaker 0: It's like I know all about old Greece relatively.

134
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,401
Speaker 0: I know a lot.

135
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, shall we have quiz time with rim and Scott?

136
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,570
Speaker 0: No, because I just read I know more about old Greece and I know nothing about new Greece.

137
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,660
Speaker 0: I know nothing about what Greece is like right now at all.

138
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,830
Speaker 1: Where did Alexander the Great come from?

139
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,813
Speaker 0: Greece no.

140
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:27,970
Speaker 1: No, he came from a Greek ish nation to the north of Greece.

141
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,058
Speaker 1: Whatever who is his dad?

142
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:36,990
Speaker 1: rim the grim the not-so-great Anyway was Archimedes Greek.

143
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,306

144
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,076
Speaker 1: Okay, I I just.

145
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:48,865
Speaker 1: it's funny because yesterday I read a long Wikipedia on something in Greece and now Greece is coming up a lot in our lives.

146
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,881
Speaker 0: Oh better get some some more sandwiches Sandwiches not Greek fire of the gyro nature.

147
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,214

148
00:08:59,315 --> 00:08:59,535
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.

150
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:00,459
Speaker 1: I'm down with that.

151
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:00,880
Speaker 1: All right.

152
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:03,369
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was a crazy tangent.

153
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,017
Speaker 0: I got some great news.

154
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,220
Speaker 1: I got some interesting news.

155
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,461
Speaker 0: All right.

156
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:13,757
Speaker 0: Well our favorite professional sport Is ice hockey.

157
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,930
Speaker 0: and well ice hockey is not doing so well.

158
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,370
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not as popular as any other professional sport in the country.

159
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:22,880
Speaker 0: I mean pretty much.

160
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,223
Speaker 0: you got football at the top Then you got your basketballs and your baseballs and all that stuff.

161
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,450
Speaker 1: granted baseball seems to be dropping like a rock.

162
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:37,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's you got your NASCAR's doing pretty well, but you know of all of them NHL not doing so.

163
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,280
Speaker 0: Well, you know, the only thing is doing worse than the NHL are like, you know We golf is doing better than the NHL.

164
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,530
Speaker 1: Well, but I mean think about it in these terms.

165
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:51,423
Speaker 1: This is what I really think Differentiates hockey from many other professional sports in the US and Canada.

166
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,630
Speaker 1: is that in every other sport?

167
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:59,667
Speaker 1: it seems many of the players do it more for the money than for the love of the game and hockey players.

168
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:04,402
Speaker 1: when there's no Hockey or something happens or they can't play their hockey.

169
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,374
Speaker 1: They just go play hockey somewhere else Even if they don't get paid.

170
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,902
Speaker 0: that's something I always liked about hockey.

171
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,309
Speaker 0: is I asked my dad once you know.

172
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,167
Speaker 0: Hey, wait a minute those NHL guys, you know when there was that strike.

173
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,962
Speaker 0: All right Why did they go and play in Europe?

174
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,290
Speaker 0: It's like they're hockey players.

175
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:27,050
Speaker 0: They just want to play hockey and then when the hockey players are in the Olympics You know, there's the Olympic break and they go play in the Olympics and I'm like, why would you try hard in the Olympics?

176
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,750
Speaker 0: Wouldn't you just get tired out and then not be able to play in the Stanley Cup?

177
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,583
Speaker 0: He's like, they're crazy hockey players.

178
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:32,490
Speaker 0: They just want to play hockey.

179
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:41,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean while hockey isn't doing well in terms of making a lot of profit It's doing well in that it supports itself and all the people who like hockey can get their hockey.

180
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:54,378
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, because NHL obviously knows it's having problems, you know outside of the big teams that are really popular A lot of the other teams Not too many people care about at all.

181
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:57,547
Speaker 0: And they're just basically fodder for the real teams.

182
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:58,470
Speaker 0: quote real teams.

183
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,236
Speaker 0: So what have they done?

184
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,610
Speaker 0: something that is pure genius that I've been begging.

185
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:12,527
Speaker 0: Every single sport that exists to do and I think Formula One the sport that should do it The most is gonna be the last one to do it.

186
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:24,195
Speaker 0: but regardless if you go to video Google dot-com slash NHL dot HTML you can watch Hockey for free.

187
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:30,030
Speaker 0: now NHL pretty much said all the hockey videos on Google video are awesome.

188
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,088
Speaker 0: You can watch the Rangers game from two or three days ago on Google video just right off MSG.

189
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:45,880
Speaker 1: now I the only reason I don't watch a lot of hockey is that I really don't like television and it's not worth the money To have it even if it were just a hockey machine.

190
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,783
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

191
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,490
Speaker 0: We could get cable television, right?

192
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,041
Speaker 0: What would we watch on cable television?

193
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:50,444
Speaker 0: hockey?

194
00:11:50,484 --> 00:12:00,442
Speaker 0: We would watch hockey I might watch an f1 race and I might watch like I don't even know if I'd watch the Super Bowl if my Might what I might watch like Battlestar Galactica.

195
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:05,250
Speaker 1: The problem is wouldn't while I would watch all that stuff I would totally TiVo it and watch it.

196
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,764
Speaker 0: Most of those things like Simpsons South Park Futurama all that shit.

197
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:13,130
Speaker 0: We Netflix that we don't need a TV for that.

198
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,414
Speaker 0: Netflix is way cheaper.

199
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:18,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, because he would be paying that was it like 40 bucks a month more than that.

200
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:30,650
Speaker 0: Yeah Just to watch hockey game, which wouldn't be that bad Except that also I don't have that much time and I don't really have time for it and not all the rituals.

201
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, and hockey games are only once every three days.

202
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:38,496
Speaker 1: So now I can just go to Google pick the hockey game I wanted to watch and watch it.

203
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:38,838
Speaker 0: Yes.

204
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,183
Speaker 0: This is I don't do work at work.

205
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:43,738
Speaker 0: whenever there's a new Rangers game I'll just watch yesterday's hockey game.

206
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:44,340
Speaker 0: Why not?

207
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,144
Speaker 0: It's free.

208
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:49,090
Speaker 0: This is awesome And I think what they have to do now, this is the great.

209
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:56,210
Speaker 0: This is a huge step for the NHL because now it's not popular but all internet people might get into it.

210
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch these videos for free.

211
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,310
Speaker 0: What they've got to do is they got to take it to the next level.

212
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,250
Speaker 0: They have to really not let up and keep pushing.

213
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:08,325
Speaker 0: You know the fact that this webpage exists and that you can watch this stuff for free.

214
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:09,850
Speaker 0: to get people to watch it.

215
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,216
Speaker 0: Here's what I would do if I were them.

216
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:11,939
Speaker 0: Watch hockey for free.

217
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,682
Speaker 0: Go go go.

218
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:17,520
Speaker 1: I would one make forever Hockey games more than I'd say, I don't know.

219
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,830
Speaker 1: 24 hours 48 hours older hockey games.

220
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:20,693
Speaker 0: Oh, you could.

221
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,782
Speaker 0: there's older hockey games on here newer games.

222
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,589
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I'm saying what I would do.

223
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:30,090
Speaker 1: I'd make all the non live hockey free to watch and it'd be awesome.

224
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,830
Speaker 1: I'd have a service where you could pay to see the games live.

225
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,738
Speaker 0: I would pay five bucks a year.

226
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,727
Speaker 1: Like you just pay, no you just pay per, I'd even make it.

227
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:42,002
Speaker 1: you just pay per game Or get a lifetime thing or yearly thing, whatever.

228
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,630
Speaker 1: The numbers don't matter.

229
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,546
Speaker 1: The point is you always make the old ones free because those are nothing but promotion.

230
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:54,510
Speaker 1: People who actually get into hockey Will probably want to see the games live and they'd probably willing to pay a small amount.

231
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:58,655
Speaker 1: Couple that with advertising Targeted at geeks and nerds.

232
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:05,086
Speaker 1: because I got to say a lot of geeks and nerds are into hockey in Proportion to geeks and nerds who are into other sports.

233
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:06,553
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know.

234
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:11,930
Speaker 0: I think that if they if they try really hard because other sports are pretty much neglecting the internet.

235
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:16,070
Speaker 0: You know, it's if you want to watch baseball in the internet, you got to pay a fuck ton of money.

236
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,672
Speaker 0: It's not worthy.

237
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,241
Speaker 0: football basically non-existent on the internet.

238
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,505
Speaker 0: You can't watch football in the internet.

239
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,749
Speaker 1: You can't watch head footballs.

240
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know basketball not on the internet.

241
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,825
Speaker 0: hockey now is all on the internet.

242
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:35,739
Speaker 0: You can watch all the games After they're done being played on Google video for free legally, you know sponsored by you know They gotta add a fight video.

243
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:39,218
Speaker 0: The thing is the NHL.

244
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:44,359
Speaker 0: if they ever, you know say, you know promote their fighting That doesn't work because then they get this huge backlash.

245
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:50,490
Speaker 0: You know what the backlash is only from non hockey I know but they just they can't do it even though they want to real bad.

246
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could because then it creates the sort of you know All the people who complain about the fighting just make the people who are interested more interested.

247
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:00,290
Speaker 0: I know I know but that's how it goes.

248
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,510
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, the NHL just keeps pushing it.

249
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,150
Speaker 0: They can I think they definitely become popular again and awesome.

250
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:12,870
Speaker 0: And even if they don't I can watch hockey now if I have bored and I got nothing to do hockey game.

251
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:15,898
Speaker 1: So a while ago there was a study.

252
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,870
Speaker 1: Well a poll that was going around and a lot of people were quoting it on the internet.

253
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:34,745
Speaker 1: It's kind of an old poll and it's been done a few times and it basically said that 90% of Americans believe in God and a lot of people were trying to use this as Evidence in various arguments and debates all over the internet most notably on FARC.

254
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,770
Speaker 0: So do we know how this poll worked or anything?

255
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,629
Speaker 1: Oh, well The poll wasn't that good.

256
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:49,578
Speaker 1: Recently a real Harris poll that went much more in depth came out and very similar if you don't know Harris is a really really Reliable and well done polling company.

257
00:15:49,598 --> 00:16:03,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, and there have been other studies and what they discovered is that actually 42% of Americans are not certain that there is a God they believe kind of but they will not commit to being absolutely Certain that there is a God.

258
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,607
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, which is significantly different than saying that 90% of Americans believe in God.

259
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:11,139
Speaker 1: now I'm not really going anywhere this other than that.

260
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,290
Speaker 1: There are a lot of interesting correlations.

261
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:16,633
Speaker 0: Read the part that you know, I want you to read All right.

262
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:22,528
Speaker 1: One thing is that very many Jews or people who claim to be Jews do not actually believe in God.

263
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,137
Speaker 0: Yep What was the percentage?

264
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:32,467
Speaker 1: let's see only 76% of Protestants 64% of Catholics and 30% of Jews are certain that there is a God.

265
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:43,702
Speaker 0: now I want to point out that Jewish culture, especially, you know, the United States mostly but Jewish Culture and the way Jewish people are mostly Jewish families Jewish mothers.

266
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,729
Speaker 0: They really stress education a lot.

267
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,214
Speaker 0: Well a lot funny.

268
00:16:48,234 --> 00:17:00,550
Speaker 1: you mentioned that because apparently there is a direct and clear negative correlation between level of education And belief in God and that is why a lot of Jews like I identify myself as Jewish.

269
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,140
Speaker 0: Ish, I guess Jewish ish kinda.

270
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,390
Speaker 1: did you call yourself an open-source juggle a while ago?

271
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could call it.

272
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:11,400
Speaker 0: whatever the hell you want The point is Jewish don't believe in God.

273
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,547
Speaker 0: A lot of rabbis don't even believe in God.

274
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:14,310
Speaker 0: It's kind of crazy.

275
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's more of a culture that we get into that but that's not the point.

276
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,295
Speaker 0: I want to know a lot about it.

277
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,983
Speaker 0: You can read Douglas Rushkoff's book.

278
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,430
Speaker 0: Nothing sacred anyway.

279
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,268
Speaker 1: There's just a lot of interesting things.

280
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:28,079
Speaker 1: Women are slightly more likely than men to believe in God.

281
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,890
Speaker 1: blacks are super more likely than whites to believe in God.

282
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,509
Speaker 1: So are Hispanics but not as much as blacks.

283
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,750
Speaker 1: Republicans are more likely to believe in God than Democrats.

284
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:50,510
Speaker 1: The education thing and then they ask a whole bunch of other interesting questions Like do you believe that all religious people worship the same God or does God actually control events on earth and all sorts of things?

285
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:56,886
Speaker 1: Now here's an interesting only 29% of people believe that God has an effect on the earth only 29%.

286
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:57,246
Speaker 0: you say yeah.

287
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,706
Speaker 0: well to the see the thing is.

288
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:07,590
Speaker 0: Gotta ask people if they allow their belief or disbelief in God to affect their decisions.

289
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,301
Speaker 1: See a question like that's not good for a poll.

290
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,490
Speaker 1: Yeah internal subjective question.

291
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,707
Speaker 1: They're asking very direct questions like is God male or female?

292
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:19,303
Speaker 0: What do people say to that?

293
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:21,416
Speaker 1: well 36 percent.

294
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,626
Speaker 0: there was a big controversy actually because I went to this.

295
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:24,670
Speaker 0: it's 50/50.

296
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,929
Speaker 1: It's 50/50 between God is male and God is neither male nor female.

297
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:33,090
Speaker 1: Ten percent say God is both and one percent say God is a woman.

298
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,549
Speaker 0: Only one percent say God's a woman.

299
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:41,674
Speaker 1: Well, remember most people in this country if they have a religion have a monotheistic Religion.

300
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:44,330
Speaker 1: that is probably not believing in some sort of earth spirit.

301
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:49,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for you know Wiccans and all then but They weren't heavily represented.

302
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:52,630
Speaker 1: or if they were they didn't say that God was female.

303
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:56,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, see one of the key tenants of Judaism is iconoclasm.

304
00:18:56,697 --> 00:19:00,194
Speaker 0: You're not supposed to like, you know Iconify anything.

305
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:08,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there was one temple I went to once where they said this They said this song or whatever you want to call it and in the song It's.

306
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:16,530
Speaker 0: there are some words that were like, you know, God is black hair and he's a man, you know It was like one sentence and it was a big controversy.

307
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,257
Speaker 0: So, okay, it just reminded me of that.

308
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,270
Speaker 0: well the only other talking about Jewish the only other interesting thing you're talking about Jewishness.

309
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,001
Speaker 1: I was going on a different tack and well Jewishness.

310
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,563
Speaker 0: I'm Jewish.

311
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,587
Speaker 0: That's all I could talk about.

312
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,354
Speaker 0: Okay Not really.

313
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:37,857
Speaker 1: the the interesting thing they talk about at the end is they're trying to figure out whether or not belief in God is actually declining or not.

314
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:47,210
Speaker 1: and the reason it's a difficult question to answer is Because in the past a lot of these polls were conducted over the phone and now many polls like this are conducted over the internet.

315
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:59,970
Speaker 1: and it turns out that a lot of studies have shown that when given a poll that is by mail or over the internet people are much more likely to tell the truth when they are asked about Something that may be socially undesirable.

316
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:11,990
Speaker 1: So if you call someone and ask them if they believe in God Even if they don't they're much more likely to say yes because they're afraid of stigma from saying no Because they're talking to an actual person.

317
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:16,970
Speaker 1: But if they're responding to a machine they're much more likely to tell the truth about their actual beliefs.

318
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:31,610
Speaker 0: But isn't there also a problem of when you're calling people on the phone You're only polling the subset of people who have home phones Which is not us and when you're doing the internet you're doing the subset of people who have internet connections and take polls on the internet.

319
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:39,980
Speaker 1: Well the way us the way Harris does it they have a very strict methodology that basically Comes up with very statistically significant results.

320
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:42,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know that but I'm just pointing that out.

321
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:52,129
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Telephone polls are largely becoming irrelevant because the only people who have telephones and are willing to do polls Tend to be busybodies.

322
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,688
Speaker 0: Yeah Busybodies do they believe in God?

323
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,588
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

324
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:08,604
Speaker 1: I've got a very relevant thing of the day My thing.

325
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,408
Speaker 0: it is not relevant.

326
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:11,297
Speaker 0: So I'll go first, but mine's very relevant.

327
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:11,840
Speaker 1: I want to do it.

328
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,603
Speaker 0: That's why you do it.

329
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:12,925
Speaker 0: second.

330
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,934
Speaker 1: No, cuz it's not actually relevant.

331
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,180
Speaker 1: You know, what my thing of the day is.

332
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,529
Speaker 1: That's why there's a joke.

333
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:18,879
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll go for it.

334
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:28,439
Speaker 1: Then someone just put up this video of a banana spider who has found a grub in his in his web And he goes over and he eats it and I just thought it was really cool.

335
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:29,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was.

336
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:33,460
Speaker 0: I was watching the video and I saw the grub in the web and I was like, where is the spider?

337
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,703
Speaker 0: Where is the spider?

338
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:37,556
Speaker 0: and then the spider comes and it's like aha.

339
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:41,540
Speaker 1: There is the spider There is the spider there's the spider.

340
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,630
Speaker 0: Alright, alright, is that it?

341
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,413
Speaker 1: That's it.

342
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:45,217
Speaker 1: Just watch this video.

343
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:45,759
Speaker 1: It's kind of cool.

344
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:48,760
Speaker 0: Okay, I guess you're not getting enough Discovery Channel.

345
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,019
Speaker 1: You can watch rooms if you want to watch a really big spider eat a really little yellow grub.

346
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:03,160
Speaker 0: So my Google video is titled almost terrible workday and in the video They say like this guy's the luckiest store clerk ever.

347
00:22:03,562 --> 00:22:05,594
Speaker 0: I don't think he's a lucky store clerk because he was lucky.

348
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,388
Speaker 1: this wouldn't happen to him Because that was an awesome story.

349
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,800
Speaker 0: if it is an awesome story, but you're not the luckiest.

350
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:25,078
Speaker 1: no, the luckiest would be if right after it happened a lottery ticket fell out of it and landed in his pocket and then I don't know Jesus and Moses and yeah Hanukkah, Harry came down and gave him a present the Jewish today.

351
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:25,800
Speaker 0: No more Jew talk.

352
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,189
Speaker 1: You're the one who started it.

353
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,417
Speaker 0: I know I'm gonna stop it, too.

354
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:32,879
Speaker 1: I'll start saying random Yiddish words if you don't say you're watching this video.

355
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,348
Speaker 0: It's very obviously a music store.

356
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:50,605
Speaker 0: you can see some amps going you could see a keyboard and there's a rack of sheet music And on the right side there's a guy sitting behind the counter and he's I think he's browsing the web on that computer there You know, he's doing something.

357
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,354
Speaker 0: So you're watching and the guy's sitting there.

358
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:53,996
Speaker 0: He's typing.

359
00:22:54,236 --> 00:23:04,640
Speaker 0: He's doing something All of a sudden like out of nowhere Frickin, you know, he picks his head up because he hears a noise and he looks to the back of the store.

360
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:08,827
Speaker 0: But you think oh he's looking to the back of the store because there's a guy in the back of the store He's looking at.

361
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:15,527
Speaker 0: then I don't know if a car hits the store or maybe just the wall Collapses for no reason or they.

362
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:21,357
Speaker 0: maybe they hung too much shit on the wall, but the wall behind him just Smashes right in on him.

363
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:24,129
Speaker 0: And I think he was the reason.

364
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,619
Speaker 0: they say he's real lucky is it totally misses him.

365
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:31,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole area is completely crushed except for this tiny area right around where he's sitting.

366
00:23:32,047 --> 00:23:33,804
Speaker 0: Yeah basically it's like a man.

367
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:40,850
Speaker 0: the guys like those looney tunes are like there's a hole in the wall and the wall falls down and Bugs Bunny ends up standing where the hole was.

368
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:41,694
Speaker 1: after it happens.

369
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:42,999
Speaker 0: The guy's just like what the fuck.

370
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:50,799
Speaker 0: He freaks out and he gets up and he starts running around doing whatever You know that you would do if the entire wall of your store fell in on you.

371
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:55,213
Speaker 0: But yeah the one spot sitting at the desk is where he didn't get hurt.

372
00:23:55,514 --> 00:24:02,159
Speaker 0: if he was like not browsing the web He would have been totally crushed by the wall Probably had to go to the hospital with some serious injuries.

373
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,620
Speaker 1: Alright, so we were inspired to do today's show.

374
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:25,231
Speaker 1: well tonight's show mostly due to the fact that back in the day a lot of newspapers and a lot of publications would around election times Come straight out and not only have opinions that were actually the opinion of the newspaper But they would officially endorse candidates in elections.

375
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:34,340
Speaker 0: Yeah nowadays all the newspapers and TV stations They say the opinions Dated here are solely those of the people on the show and are not the opinion of the network at all.

376
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:39,920
Speaker 1: I like the idea of a newspaper saying you know what we're back in so-and-so because blah and you can suck it.

377
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,826
Speaker 1: This is our opinion.

378
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,879
Speaker 1: If you don't like it, well suck it.

379
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, nowadays you get newspapers.

380
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:50,530
Speaker 0: the editor-in-chief will write an article saying, you know This guy is great and some other people write op-eds about.

381
00:24:50,590 --> 00:25:09,353
Speaker 0: so-and-so is great and someone will write a letter to the editor saying So-and-so is great But it's only in this op-ed section and the rest of the newspaper while it might obviously be slanted you know, I mean everyone knows the New York Post is totally right-wing and everyone knows the New York Times is slightly left-wing if not a lot more than that.

382
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:18,639
Speaker 0: and everyone knows that those newspapers with just the Red-ink and the black ink totally socialist the socialist worker the communist worker the yeah I know at least know what it is.

383
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,937
Speaker 0: at least those newspapers had the balls to say they're socialist.

384
00:25:22,138 --> 00:25:28,003
Speaker 1: the Piece of paper with a bunch of red ink that some hippie guy with dreadlocks tries to show newspaper.

385
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,494
Speaker 0: that's in New York the epoch whatever the one for the.

386
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:38,560
Speaker 1: I just remember the one day at our IT Where I was walking to class and I was dressed up real nice because I was doing something that day.

387
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:46,988
Speaker 1: And one of these hippies with the socialist club on campus, which was probably the smallest status club on the campus Even though it's pretty vocal.

388
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were real loud, but there weren't many of them.

389
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:49,740
Speaker 0: Nope

390
00:25:50,222 --> 00:26:03,032
Speaker 1: and he's in the middle of the quarter mile yelling and screaming and handing out the socialist worker and he's like The war in Iraq blah blah blah because this is before the war in Iraq happened, you know back before everything went to shit and I was against the war.

391
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,398
Speaker 1: I was against the war from the start.

392
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:14,133
Speaker 1: but When this guy comes up to me and he's like the wars about oil blah blah blah blah blah I was just like I'm for the war.

393
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:20,934
Speaker 1: He's like what blah blah I'm like cuz it'll probably make oil prices go down and the guy just exploded.

394
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:30,640
Speaker 1: and then he every point he made I just made the stupidest Simplest counterpoint I could even when it was something I totally disagreed with and he couldn't deal with it.

395
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,614
Speaker 1: He's just yelling and yelling and yelling and yelling and getting red at the face.

396
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,820
Speaker 1: I just laughed and walked away.

397
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:36,866
Speaker 1: It was the best thing ever.

398
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:40,899
Speaker 0: I would have been like, you know, I'm for the war just because I'm against you.

399
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:46,418
Speaker 0: No, I was against the war But because you're also against the war and I really don't want to end up a dirty hippie like you.

400
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:51,220
Speaker 1: At one point I was like my dad works in the arms industry.

401
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,068
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get a lot of money if this war happens.

402
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,053
Speaker 0: Oh, that's great.

403
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,580
Speaker 1: This our war is paying for my college.

404
00:26:56,902 --> 00:26:57,239
Speaker 0: awesome.

405
00:26:58,464 --> 00:26:59,599
Speaker 1: He was so mad.

406
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:09,866
Speaker 1: It was great every day and a couple times I'd see him on campus and he'd see me and he'd narrow his eyes and that Newman here remembered you Like how to stand out?

407
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:11,491
Speaker 0: Yeah a little bit a little bit.

408
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, those guys are fun though.

409
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:22,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Inspired by that geek nights is going to officially endorse some candidates However, not many because we don't like most of the people running in the United States elections.

410
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:25,109
Speaker 0: No, no, and we're only pretty much the elections.

412
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:37,391
Speaker 0: Yeah It it's only New York State people we have to vote for and you know our local representatives and we have I think one Person in the Federal House of Representatives to vote for.

413
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,700
Speaker 1: and now to to all of our non US listeners.

414
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:43,280
Speaker 1: I promise we'll keep this interesting and not go into boring detail.

415
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,868
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean even people in the US.

416
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:50,811
Speaker 0: if you don't live in New York and don't have the same candidates as we do It's not gonna be interesting to you at all.

417
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:51,274
Speaker 0: What do you care?

418
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,120
Speaker 0: who our governor is?

419
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,349
Speaker 0: They have they're not governing you.

Speaker 0: if you're living, California You have the govern ater.

421
00:27:56,589 --> 00:28:02,480
Speaker 0: whatever I like the govern ater he's alright But I'm you know, it's not as bad as some people make him out to be at least no, not at all.

422
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,393
Speaker 1: I'm a supporter of the govern ater because he while I do disagree with him on points.

423
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:17,586
Speaker 1: He is very much a Republican like the old Newt Gingrich days which while not great or a lot better than the current Republican day I don't know enough about him to say anymore.

424
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:23,353
Speaker 0: But yeah, anyway, alright, so we're gonna talk about New York candidates But we're still gonna try to make it entertaining.

425
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,666
Speaker 1: Yeah real quick Let's just get the names out of people.

426
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:28,820
Speaker 1: We officially want to endorse as I guess journalists.

427
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,365
Speaker 1: Alright, you know what?

428
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,291
Speaker 1: I'll start cuz I got the easiest one.

429
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,635
Speaker 1: This is probably the only candidate.

430
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:35,678
Speaker 1: I'm actually behind.

431
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:42,980
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Elliot Spitzer and David Paterson are running for office governor and lieutenant governor.

432
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,590
Speaker 1: Respectively and not only am I endorsing them but they are running.

433
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:49,860
Speaker 1: they have been nominated by more than one party.

434
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:57,420
Speaker 1: They're running as Democrats, but they're also running as the Independence Party Which is a party that I am pretty much.

435
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:58,102
Speaker 1: It's the.

436
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:03,907
Speaker 1: it's the political party in America founded by a guy who gave a lot of money to our IT Among other things.

437
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,375
Speaker 0: I guess he got his money's worth.

438
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:14,688
Speaker 1: he convinced us the party is the closest thing to my beliefs as to how government should be run if Any party in the United States far and away?

439
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:22,673
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm very Libertarian party not at all because they do not agree.

440
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:29,764
Speaker 1: I do not agree with them on many points Many points and I get this party is the closest thing to what I believe politically of anything.

441
00:29:29,804 --> 00:29:32,533
Speaker 1: not to say that I agree with them a hundred percent because I certainly don't.

442
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:39,071
Speaker 1: but that's the closest thing and Because Elliot Spitzer and David Patterson are running in America.

443
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:43,345
Speaker 1: You can be nominated by as many parties as Parties will not like.

444
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:46,280
Speaker 0: let's say me and rim started the geek night's political party, right?

445
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:52,140
Speaker 0: Since we were a really small political party, we might not have a person in every disc.

446
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,428
Speaker 0: Let's say we're only in New York political party, right?

447
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,980
Speaker 0: New York has I don't know how many districts a whole lot of districts of voting.

448
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:03,820
Speaker 0: let's say we don't have a Candidate for every single district of New York.

449
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:12,553
Speaker 0: well in those districts, you know, we can either have a blank spot on the ballot or We can endorse say the Republican candidate.

450
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:20,680
Speaker 0: then people have a choice They can vote for the candidate on the Republican line or they can vote for the candidate on the geek night's party line.

451
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:22,969
Speaker 1: Yeah Now the benefit of this is in America.

452
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,499
Speaker 1: if you get a certain percentage of the vote Then you are eligible for money from the government in the next set of elections.

453
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:34,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's say also basically get recognized as a real political party.

454
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:40,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let's say Joe Blow is running for governor and we don't have a candidate for governor in our shitty little party.

455
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:51,920
Speaker 0: So we endorse Joe Blow and Joe Blow wins because enough people vote for him But 25% of the people who voted for Joe Blow voted for him as a geek night's party member and not as a Republican.

456
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:53,271
Speaker 0: We get mad moneys.

457
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,420
Speaker 0: Yo, it's awesome.

458
00:30:54,922 --> 00:31:00,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Elliot Spitzer and David Patterson are running on the Democratic Party and the Independence Party.

459
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:04,878
Speaker 1: So I officially endorse voting for these two men on the Independence Party.

460
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:08,552
Speaker 1: line State is column C on the ballot.

461
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:10,600
Speaker 0: I just want to talk about Elliot Spitzer for like a minute.

462
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,280
Speaker 0: All right Is that basically Elliot Spitzer was until recent?

463
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,220
Speaker 0: Well, he still is the Attorney General of New York State and as Attorney General he has done many things that are awesome.

464
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:27,640
Speaker 0: He basically goes after all the people I think are assholes and tries to sue them as the state.

465
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:30,113
Speaker 0: He sued a bunch of evil insurance guys.

466
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:31,380
Speaker 0: He sued spammers.

467
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:38,444
Speaker 0: He sued spyware guys all sorts of awesomeness and it you know, that's how I found out about him and he's way cool for it.

468
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:42,379
Speaker 0: and I look at what he stands for and most of it's awesome.

469
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,820
Speaker 0: and You know a lot of people say, uh, he's just doing that kind of stuff to get people to like him.

470
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,363
Speaker 1: You know what if someone does good things because they want to be liked and then they keep doing good things because they keep wanting To be liked.

471
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm saying is it doesn't matter his intent.

472
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,700
Speaker 0: He's doing what I want and he's probably going to continue to do what I want.

473
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:04,338
Speaker 0: I don't care if his intent is because the result will be pleasing to me.

474
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:10,739
Speaker 0: and The only thing I disagree with Elliot Spitzer on is he is anti, you know, violent video game.

475
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:22,495
Speaker 0: and While I don't want to vote for someone who's anti violent video game I think it'll be enough to just write him a letter because I if I agree with him on almost everything else I can let one thing slide.

476
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:25,633
Speaker 0: Yeah This will be banned.

477
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:26,720
Speaker 1: that's not gonna happen.

478
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,479
Speaker 0: It's not like the other if the other candidate isn't exactly pro violent video game.

479
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,600
Speaker 1: So we really need a pro violent video game candidate.

480
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:37,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, dude The candidate goes up and he's like.

481
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:43,700
Speaker 0: I think video games need to be gorier and bloodier with more sex and more guts.

482
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:47,896
Speaker 0: This I got the name of the party already the not enough Gibbs.

483
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:50,989
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, I gotta say this right now.

484
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,100
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the list of parties in New York State.

485
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:54,810
Speaker 1: Now what I just wanted.

486
00:32:55,112 --> 00:33:04,143
Speaker 1: I'll I know what Scott's gonna say But I want to jump in real quick and point out that in America the name of your political party usually has Absolutely.

487
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,672
Speaker 1: Fuck all to do with what your party stands for.

488
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,558
Speaker 0: for example, the Constitution Party.

489
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:09,782
Speaker 1: Oh God Don't God.

490
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:13,292
Speaker 0: the Constitution Party has nothing to do with the Constitution.

491
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:18,268
Speaker 1: the Constitution Party wants quote To their conservative blah blah blah.

492
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:22,060
Speaker 1: They want to bring the quote biblical foundations of American jurisprudence.

493
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:27,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should be the Bible Party, but no they are the Constitution Party.

494
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,979
Speaker 0: why they call themselves that I don't know.

495
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:38,229
Speaker 0: But anyway You know looking at the list of New York State parties this Republican Democratic Independence working families working families make sense.

496
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,120
Speaker 0: libertarian green socialist workers socialist equality.

497
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:43,745
Speaker 0: alright, alright, alright.

498
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,936
Speaker 0: hit this one party that catches my eye.

499
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:54,787
Speaker 0: and The abbreviation for the party is our th And it says here on the right side.

500
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,051
Speaker 0: What does our th stand for?

501
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:58,520
Speaker 0: it stands for rent is too high.

502
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:06,160
Speaker 0: Ha if you think rent is too high you can vote for Jimmy McMillan for a New York State governor.

503
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:10,196
Speaker 0: I don't think he's gonna win because you know what my rent isn't too high.

504
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,464
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll vote for him Maybe I don't know.

505
00:34:12,524 --> 00:34:14,290
Speaker 0: No, I think that spitzer is better.

506
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:22,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I would love to have lower rent But I'm not gonna vote for a guy whose only political stance is rent is too high.

507
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:30,280
Speaker 1: Now the sad truth is I hate to say it but there's other than maybe kinky Friedman in Texas just because he's hilarious.

508
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,027
Speaker 1: There's no one I support Anywhere, there's no one else I could endorse.

509
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:38,000
Speaker 1: I could anti endorse a bunch of people but that list is long.

510
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:45,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's only one person I want to specifically anti endorse and this is our person who is the representative of.

511
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:52,757
Speaker 0: you Know us in New York where we live in New York State in the federal House of Representatives and that is Sue Kelly.

512
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:05,986
Speaker 0: I looked back in the day when I moved to Beacon at you know, the voting record of all my congress people and senators and Sue Kelly everything she voted on like Every single thing.

513
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:10,580
Speaker 0: I went looking at all the bills in the House of Representatives at the federal government in the United States.

514
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:16,387
Speaker 0: She voted the opposite of what I would have voted on every single bill Every single one.

515
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,739
Speaker 0: I would look at it and I would say yes, Sue Kelly voted.

516
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,889
Speaker 0: No No, Sue Kelly voted.

517
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:22,499
Speaker 0: Yes, every last one.

518
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:27,980
Speaker 0: Now the Independence Party is supporting her and so is the Conservative Party in the Republican Party.

519
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,820
Speaker 0: But god damn there's no way I'm voting for someone who votes the opposite of the way I do.

520
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Democrat running is John Hall and I'll probably end up voting for him because he's the only other choice.

521
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:47,760
Speaker 0: but even if I disagree with him on a lot of things which I'm sure I do I Know that he'll vote differently from the Republican Sue Kelly.

522
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,089
Speaker 0: Well, I mean even he votes differently.

523
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:53,160
Speaker 0: just once I'll agree with him more than I agree with Sue Kelly.

524
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,469
Speaker 1: I spoke with John Hall very briefly a while ago really as he was around and I ran.

525
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:13,080
Speaker 1: actually I Ran into a whole bunch of candidates over the past month just around New York City and in various places doing things Mm-hmm, and I ran into John Hall up here when he was doing something one day and he seems like an unassuming guy.

526
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:24,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's one of his platform seems to be I was something to the effect of make the Bush administration accountable for what it's done, which is Definitely vague and not actually going to happen.

527
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,420
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is definitely a lesser of two evils situation.

528
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know about John Hall.

529
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:32,845
Speaker 0: Slowly on her vote.

530
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:39,411
Speaker 1: John Hall votes for one thing Differently from the way Sue Kelly would if I consider it a victory.

531
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:43,526
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying is is suke, you know, he Every single thing?

532
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:44,209
Speaker 0: she voted the way.

533
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,838
Speaker 0: I disagree with every last one.

534
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:52,079
Speaker 1: So for all of you foreign listeners American elections are really kind of silly.

535
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't have but we don't have or anything good We don't have.

536
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:57,606
Speaker 1: it's just a winner.

537
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:06,891
Speaker 0: take the big elections aren't so silly because they get a lot of attention But everything that's not big in the public eye The big elections is all really silly and kind of fun.

538
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:09,160
Speaker 0: and that's where the democratic process actually works.

539
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:10,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, except that no one votes.

540
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,460
Speaker 0: I know if more people voted it would work but but no cuz no one cares.

541
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:16,930
Speaker 0: Oh, there's 29 districts in New York.

542
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,673
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

543
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:19,380
Speaker 1: That is interesting.

544
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:28,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in general we could talk a bit about our actual political leanings I guess or we could just go to bed and start fresh next week.

545
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,699
Speaker 1: cuz once again, we got a crazy weekend coming up.

546
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:36,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know who I'm gonna vote for for our senator though You know what I had to say it.

547
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:51,420
Speaker 1: but I'm pretty much not going to vote at all on Many of the positions that I can vote on because I simply don't agree with any of the candidates or can't find enough actual Information about him or I really don't care because none of them stand for me at all.

548
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,866
Speaker 1: So it doesn't matter which one gets elected.

549
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:54,432
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna endorse one with a vote.

550
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not going to lend legitimacy.

551
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,515
Speaker 0: I think there's like three positions where I'm just not gonna vote.

552
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,500
Speaker 1: cuz here's the cool thing.

553
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:17,440
Speaker 1: One of the things that a lot of members of the Independence Party are really pushing is that they want there to be very literally a none-of-the-above option where if you go and vote you can say I Do not want any of these people and if that wins then you have to do something to the election

554
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:21,536
Speaker 0: But you to make a new election where none of the existing candidates can run again.

555
00:38:21,837 --> 00:38:22,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

556
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,486
Speaker 0: That would be the way.

557
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,520
Speaker 1: I mean you'd have to think out all the details of that.

558
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:33,708
Speaker 1: But in general a lot of people say, you know You should vote no matter what but I say if you really don't agree with any of the candidates Don't vote for the lesser of two evils.

559
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:36,800
Speaker 1: Just don't vote because not voting does say something.

560
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:47,140
Speaker 1: It says you either don't care or aren't represented and the less people vote the less Legitimacy there is around the voting process which might force some people to take action.

561
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:56,214
Speaker 0: Yes That's what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in and the people I want I'm gonna vote for and when there's no one To choose from I just won't vote in that column for any of those people.

562
00:38:56,636 --> 00:39:00,756
Speaker 0: and then you know They'll see that though They'll freakin see that.

563
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:11,698
Speaker 0: you know there was someone who went in and specifically voted for X Y & Z but didn't vote for any of the people for the position of Comptroller because they all suck unless we use d-bold machines.

564
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,839
Speaker 0: Oh Pund yeah.

565
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:22,166
Speaker 0: The other thing is that in the United States when you go into vote at the top of the voting machine on the ballot There are questions you can vote for.

566
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:26,500
Speaker 1: well referendum reference got a little while ago was like we should talk about the questions.

567
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,592
Speaker 1: I was like what the fuck are you talking about?

568
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:30,040
Speaker 0: They phrase them as questions.

569
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,595
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, do you want you know this to go into effect?

570
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,200
Speaker 0: or do you think that you know?

571
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,950
Speaker 0: This is right.

572
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:37,458
Speaker 0: Yes or no?

573
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,664
Speaker 0: And they're all yes or no.

574
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:42,075
Speaker 1: the problem it varies state by state and city by city.

575
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,952
Speaker 1: how these things work is in a lot Of places referendums are non-binding.

576
00:39:44,972 --> 00:39:45,979
Speaker 1: They're basically just a poll.

577
00:39:46,502 --> 00:40:03,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I always even if there's no one on the ballot I want to vote for I will go always go in and answer the questions Because you know if you get there's a little piece of paper you can pick up that gives you the full details of what you're Exactly doing with the questions and I will always have an opinion yes or no.

578
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:07,583
Speaker 0: and that's where I can vote directly representing myself without Between.

579
00:40:07,703 --> 00:40:13,540
Speaker 1: I'm generally in more in favor of a more representative government and I generally dislike the idea of referendum.

580
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,316
Speaker 1: Don't move to Oregon except on issue.

581
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:22,300
Speaker 1: I know about Oregon Yeah, except on issues where it really matters or it really should be that way which aren't many.

582
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:32,213
Speaker 1: I mean I'm of the mind that people should work with their state legislature for local issues or their local government and Vote and however in that and the local government represents them.

583
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:38,453
Speaker 1: They elect Representatives to the United States federal House of Representatives, which represent them.

584
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:50,339
Speaker 1: the people to the federal government the House of Representatives The door the state legislature or someone should then choose a senator though It could be okay if states have people choose them like they do now.

585
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:55,740
Speaker 1: But the senators should be the representatives of the state to the federal government.

586
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:58,920
Speaker 1: The senator should not be accountable to the people of the state.

587
00:40:59,221 --> 00:41:01,711
Speaker 1: They should be accountable to the state legislature like they used to be.

588
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is a little bit that way.

589
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,900
Speaker 0: I mean if you send a letter to your senator, you're almost always gonna get some crap form letter back.

590
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is you send a letter to your representative.

591
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,272
Speaker 0: It's a good chance.

592
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:14,300
Speaker 0: They'll actually reply to you kind of.

593
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,040
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is senators are a little more high-profile.

594
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:20,319
Speaker 1: So as a result, there's a slightly lower incumbency rate there.

595
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:34,020
Speaker 1: So as a result, you have a lot of senators who do things in their home states that don't need to be done Just to generate awareness to get votes when they should be working on actual real government business that doesn't involve their home state so much.

596
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:42,579
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean my view is actually a lot more complicated than that But I would need a whole show just to lay the basics of what I believe.

597
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,914
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's who geek nights is voting for if you live where we live.
