1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,145
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 18th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:10,366
Speaker 0: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:14,138
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,648
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,560
Speaker 0: Tonight, we're talking about drugs.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:33,401
Speaker 0: So, last year around this time, when PAX Badges pretty much sold out right away, we said something to the effect of, "You gotta be

8
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:33,743
Speaker 0: quicker.".

9
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:38,159
Speaker 0: But now it's at the point where quickness basically is trumped by randomness.

10
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,366
Speaker 1: No, it's still quickness.

11
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:44,256
Speaker 1: It's, "You have to follow and be on the internet, connected,

12
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:45,681
Speaker 1: 24/7.".

13
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,200
Speaker 1: And you know what time of year it's gonna be.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:03,180
Speaker 0: Ah, but Scott, even then, it doesn't matter because, from what I can gather, four-day badges sold out within about ten minutes, but that was because there was an eight-minute window between when you got through the queue and you had to type in all your stuff before you lost your reservation.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

16
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:11,420
Speaker 0: I hear a few people who are fairly reliable who said that they were actually sold out within a minute, maybe two.

17
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:13,859
Speaker 0: And that it was just a matter of people typing stuff in.

18
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:20,360
Speaker 0: And because of the queue, the queue was set in stone probably within ten or fifteen seconds.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:28,640
Speaker 0: I know someone who literally saw the tweet, had been constantly hitting F5 on the page, went in, and they were sold out by the time they got through the queue.

20
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,920
Speaker 1: Someone else was faster than that.

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,947
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying being fast only gets you so far.

22
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:41,480
Speaker 0: Of all the people who are effectively equivalently fast, that still is not a guarantee of getting a badge anymore.

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,526
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's not just how fast you are, right?

24
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:47,858
Speaker 1: It was the tweet delayed getting to your Twitter client by three seconds.

25
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:48,440
Speaker 1: How often is it?

26
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:49,004
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

27
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:49,770
Speaker 0: There's people hitting F5.

28
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:50,960
Speaker 0: I'm saying it doesn't matter.

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:59,400
Speaker 0: I'm saying the spread between the first person who bought a four-day badge and the last person in terms of when they entered the site is probably negligible.

30
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:00,708
Speaker 1: It's a few seconds.

31
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:02,320
Speaker 1: Every second counts.

32
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:06,320
Speaker 0: No, in the real world, Scott, for a human's reaction time, that is negligible.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,158
Speaker 1: Be connected to the Internet.

34
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,098
Speaker 0: Even then, that does not guarantee.

35
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,055
Speaker 1: You can see the difference between me at work.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,387
Speaker 0: You didn't get any badge.

37
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:17,640
Speaker 0: You got to hope we get accepted for lectures again this year.

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,446
Speaker 1: I didn't try.

39
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:19,474
Speaker 1: I saw the tweet.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,380
Speaker 0: Are you sure you didn't try?

41
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,138
Speaker 1: I didn't click on it.

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,873
Speaker 0: Because I clicked on it immediately and it took me about fifteen minutes to get through the queue.

43
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:28,840
Speaker 0: And even then, four days were already sold out.

44
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:29,765
Speaker 0: I did not attempt.

45
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:31,637
Speaker 1: I said, "Oh, there it

46
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:31,738
Speaker 1: is.".

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:41,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's also all moot because while the four days sold out immediately, the one days lasted long enough to where if you wanted one and you were quick, you could have gotten one.

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:57,540
Speaker 0: So you could have guaranteed yourself four days at PAX for next to $25, but I don't think it's reasonable to say that there is any measure you can take short of being a good presenter, an enforcer, or an exhibitor to guarantee yourself a four-day badge at this point anymore.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,979
Speaker 1: You could be a convention center employee.

50
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:01,969
Speaker 0: Then you don't get to do the events.

51
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,740
Speaker 0: You're just in the building.

52
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,125
Speaker 1: For Penny Arcade Corporation.

53
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:08,479
Speaker 1: You could work for a game company that is exhibiting.

54
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,440
Speaker 0: Like I said, Scott, exhibitor.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,671
Speaker 1: Well, you aren't the exhibitor.

56
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,620
Speaker 1: You work for an exhibitor.

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,631
Speaker 0: That means you get an exhibitor badge.

58
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,100
Speaker 0: You're an exhibitor for all intents and purposes.

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Speaker 1: You could work for a company that buys a panel, like if you work for Nvidia and you're on the Nvidia panel.

60
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's basically being part of the presentation and/or exhibition part.

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,819
Speaker 1: You could be some sort of press person.

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
Speaker 0: In fact, Scott, most of those people have exhibitor badges, not speaker badges.

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,540
Speaker 0: You could be a press person.

64
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,540
Speaker 0: Press doesn't give you a free badge, from what I read.

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,830
Speaker 0: I've never applied for a press badge.

66
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:38,240
Speaker 0: I don't know the full policy.

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,769
Speaker 0: Did that noise mean the Mets lost?

68
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,040
Speaker 0: I guess it's raining because they're not playing.

69
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,039
Speaker 1: No, they're in Colorado.

70
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:42,732
Speaker 0: Did they lose?

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,470
Speaker 1: I don't know if the game's over yet.

72
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,860
Speaker 1: I watched part of it when I was at work.

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,078
Speaker 0: Because I'm pretty sure that sound on your phone, just based on statistical evidence...

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,619
Speaker 1: Well, based on the month of the year.

75
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,290
Speaker 0: Based on statistical evidence of myself hearing that sound and then you saying what it was, that sound means one thing.

76
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,719
Speaker 0: It means the Mets have just lost.

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,244
Speaker 1: The Mets lost 11 to 3.

78
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,996
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, PAX badges are sold out.

79
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:08,540
Speaker 0: That sucks.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,935
Speaker 0: PAX Australia badges are also sold out.

81
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:11,500
Speaker 0: That sucks.

82
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,619
Speaker 1: PAX Australia badges took a while to sell out.

83
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,855
Speaker 1: It's really only PAX Prime that sells out instantly.

84
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:17,720
Speaker 0: The other ones do not.

85
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 0: So I would argue the reason for that is pretty simple.

86
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,060
Speaker 0: With PAX East, the three days sell out immediately.

87
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:31,117
Speaker 0: But then as soon as all the hotels that aren't awful sell out, suddenly people stop buying badges while they look for a hotel.

88
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:32,280
Speaker 0: that isn't just awful.

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,851
Speaker 1: I think it's that PAX has been in Seattle longer.

90
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:38,917
Speaker 1: It's just bigger there.

91
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:39,880
Speaker 1: More people know it.

92
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,807
Speaker 1: They have more influence in that area.

93
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:45,000
Speaker 1: There's a greater density of people who know it and want to go to it.

94
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:57,560
Speaker 0: But there are more people total, statistically, who know about PAX, are into gaming, and are nearby with Boston because transit is so much better and the city is so much closer.

95
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,340
Speaker 0: I think the primary factor is that there are the number of hotels that aren't literally bullshit.

96
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:09,760
Speaker 0: As in there are piles of shit that came out of a cow or a bull of some kind.

97
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,243
Speaker 0: It's too small.

98
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:18,100
Speaker 0: Because look, the hotels that you don't have to take a bus to get to sell out as fast as the badges.

99
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,900
Speaker 0: And then the badges stop selling because no one can find a good hotel.

100
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,015
Speaker 0: And it takes people a while to resign themselves to staying in a hotel that's so far away.

101
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,440
Speaker 0: they have to take a shuttle bus every day.

102
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,498
Speaker 0: And that's when the rest of the badges sell out.

103
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,806
Speaker 1: Anyway, things sell out.

104
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,150
Speaker 1: This is how big events go.

105
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:33,896
Speaker 0: Try to get Super Bowl tickets, genius.

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,640
Speaker 0: The whole reason I brought that up is just because a lot of nerds are complaining that it's sold out.

107
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,426
Speaker 0: And yeah, I get you.

108
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:40,971
Speaker 0: It sucks.

109
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:41,899
Speaker 0: I feel you.

110
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, thousands of people who want to go to PAX can't go.

111
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,293
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say it doesn't suck that there's some badges being scalped.

112
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,740
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say it doesn't suck that it sells out.

113
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,619
Speaker 1: But there's such a small number of them.

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,216
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say this doesn't suck in any way.

115
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:54,800
Speaker 0: It sucks.

116
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Speaker 0: But I feel like most of you who are complaining, this is why I'm talking about this on Thursday instead of Tuesday, have never tried to buy tickets to a popular concert or sporting event in your life.

117
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:07,959
Speaker 1: That is true.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,780
Speaker 0: Do you know how many times I sat like as a kid F-fiving to try to get tickets to like a local metal concert or something and still didn't get them?

119
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:17,799
Speaker 1: It happens.

120
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,193
Speaker 1: Yeah.

121
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:20,406
Speaker 1: And it could be worse, right?

122
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:24,060
Speaker 1: Think about like the Ticketmaster stuff where they sell you as many tickets as you want to buy.

123
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:35,820
Speaker 1: And one guy, some ticket broker, goes and waits in line all night, wakes up in the morning for some Madison Square Garden concert, buys three hundred tickets and then goes and sells them through his brokerage.

124
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,979
Speaker 1: You know, it's like it happens.

125
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,199
Speaker 1: But I guess the moral is Pax only lets people buy a few.

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:49,620
Speaker 0: There's not much you can do about it because of the fact that even the nerdy conventions that are in the biggest convention centers have problems with this.

127
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,540
Speaker 1: San Diego Comic-Con sells out in a fraction of a second or whatever.

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,067
Speaker 0: There's basically.

129
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:56,160
Speaker 0: it's an intractable problem for the short term.

130
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:09,060
Speaker 0: Now, in the long term, I think convention culture is going to become a serious force just for the fact that Internet culture is starting to trump physical culture among punk kids in North America.

131
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:10,020
Speaker 1: Whatever.

132
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,120
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's going to be a cool thing.

133
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:22,720
Speaker 0: I think there's going to be more and more conventions just because the one thing you can't get from Internet culture is the physical socialization and actually getting laid.

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,820
Speaker 1: No one gets laid at conventions.

135
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,099
Speaker 0: That is not true.

136
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,900
Speaker 1: Who got laid at a convention?

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,140
Speaker 0: People get laid at conventions.

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:30,536
Speaker 1: Like?

139
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,980
Speaker 0: What, you want me to name names of people I know who got laid at conventions?

140
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,800
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that it seems like conventions, these nerd conventions, are people trying to get laid and failing.

141
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,060
Speaker 1: People who already come with a significant other and get laid, but they get laid anyway.

142
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,019
Speaker 1: And people trying to get laid and then getting kicked out for sexually harassing people because they're creepy dudes.

143
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,200
Speaker 0: I would say that the people who you see trying to get laid are the ones who are never going to get laid.

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,419
Speaker 0: You don't see the people who are trying to get laid actually get laid because they're off getting laid.

145
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,159
Speaker 1: Are they at the convention then?

146
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,079
Speaker 0: You can tell.

147
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,060
Speaker 0: There's certain groups of kids and you can see the way they interact.

148
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,260
Speaker 0: You know that half of them are getting laid at some anime con.

149
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,959
Speaker 0: That's just how it works.

150
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,500
Speaker 0: That's how kids, and when I say kids, I mean people under 20.

151
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,578
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure most of them, right?

152
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,480
Speaker 1: I think it's one of those things where it's like- Involving penetration.

153
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:28,556
Speaker 0: The kids who show up at a con, and again, when I say kids, I mean people under 20, and make out.

154
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,520
Speaker 0: You can't do that on the internet yet, effectively, unless you invest in a lot of teledildonics.

155
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,080
Speaker 0: So as a result- We should start a teledildonics company.

156
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,840
Speaker 1: We probably should.

157
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,738
Speaker 1: Our shit would be so much better than everyone else's.

158
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:58,400
Speaker 0: So basically it's just that the flash mob convention is going to be an increasing force of society because culture among kids today is less and less tied to the physical place they were born or live and more and more tied to the people they hang out with on the internet.

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,040
Speaker 1: Well, anyone who's getting laid isn't going to be paying attention to Twitter to buy tickets, so.

160
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,856
Speaker 0: Uh, depends.

161
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 1: They're probably RP- Oh shit, we gotta buy tickets!

162
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,146
Speaker 0: They might be RP-ing.

163
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:12,300
Speaker 0: they're getting laid over the internet, even though they're in the same room.

164
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:13,779
Speaker 0: Ahem, someone we knew.

165
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,219
Speaker 1: So, news.

166
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:15,853
Speaker 1: News?

167
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:17,211
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

168
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:17,920
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to be news.

169
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,119
Speaker 0: Your mom, it's your mom.

170
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:26,578
Speaker 1: So, everybody knows, who's anybody, that there's a new Daft Punk album coming out May 21st.

171
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,420
Speaker 0: I was listening to Human After All.

172
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:31,299
Speaker 1: Okay.

173
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:32,278
Speaker 0: All day.

174
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:32,914
Speaker 1: Yep.

175
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,280
Speaker 1: But basically, this thing is crazy.

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:36,663
Speaker 1: Why?

177
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,180
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure out.

178
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Speaker 1: I mean, clearly Daft Punk is the best and the awesomest.

179
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,999
Speaker 1: No one's arguing that shit, right?

180
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,840
Speaker 1: But it's like, how come no other musical group of the present time can make this happen?

181
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,920
Speaker 1: Has it happened since, like, The Beatles or Elvis?

182
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,050
Speaker 1: Like, who since then?

183
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:53,800
Speaker 1: Michael Jackson.

184
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,756
Speaker 1: What else?

185
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 1: Not quite on the same level of people, like, anticipating and going crazy.

186
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,520
Speaker 0: I think it's partly regional.

187
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:10,900
Speaker 0: Like, if you go to South Korea right now, Psy is a bigger deal than in the US.

188
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,999
Speaker 1: He's a big deal, but he's not a Daft Punk deal.

189
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,139
Speaker 0: But Daft Punk, I think it's because- Daft Punk is also a worldwide deal.

190
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:23,140
Speaker 1: True, but it's worldwide in a sense that I, at least, I don't run into- It's like The Beatles and Elvis are worldwide deals.

191
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,571
Speaker 0: I don't, it's, the people don't go,

192
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:24,672
Speaker 0: "Eeee!"

193
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:27,800
Speaker 0: They have a different, similar reaction.

194
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:37,520
Speaker 1: The point is people are so highly anticipating and desiring and expecting and chomping at their bits, as if it was, say, a new Apple device.

195
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,078
Speaker 0: I think this is primarily because of the circles and company you keep on.

196
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:45,700
Speaker 0: the internet is heavily overlapping with Daft Punk fans.

197
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,740
Speaker 1: But it is not just that.

198
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,920
Speaker 1: If you look on the general internets, right, this is basically showing up everywhere.

199
00:10:53,281 --> 00:11:01,160
Speaker 1: All over, there's people are making, like, fake videos and trying to, you know, put together the song based on bits and pieces of teasers.

200
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,520
Speaker 0: I think it's also that internet people are grossly over-representing Daft Punk fans.

201
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,880
Speaker 0: Okay, but this thing is also- Non-internet people, non-Daft Punk fans.

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,979
Speaker 1: This thing is also all over the TV.

203
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:17,840
Speaker 1: I mean, they bought ads for this thing, like, fucking during SNL, right?

204
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,760
Speaker 1: How many albums buy ads to promote themselves during SNL that aren't, say, Lonely Island?

205
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,920
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Scott.

206
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Speaker 0: So, I'm going to pretend to be a current punk kid from today's era.

207
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,020
Speaker 0: Scott, Scott, what's an album?

208
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:29,738
Speaker 1: I know.

209
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,480
Speaker 1: How many, you know, albums these days have, like, ads in the subway trying to sell them?

210
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:35,367
Speaker 0: I don't know.

211
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:36,100
Speaker 0: I don't really pay attention to ads.

212
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,374
Speaker 1: I see more video games in the subway ads than I've ever seen an album down there.

213
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,297
Speaker 0: Video games and skin clearing up Dr.

214
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:44,960
Speaker 0: Zizemore's.

215
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

216
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:46,285
Speaker 1: Exactly.

217
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,000
Speaker 1: So, this thing is off the hook.

218
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:50,499
Speaker 0: I'm pretty excited.

219
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not saying I'm not excited.

220
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:57,120
Speaker 1: I'm saying, why am I and everyone else excited for an album?

221
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,439
Speaker 1: We haven't been excited for an album since forever ago.

222
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,280
Speaker 0: I think it, well, when was the last Daft Punk album?

223
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,758
Speaker 0: That was a long time ago.

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

225
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,515
Speaker 1: Long time ago.

226
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,015
Speaker 1: I don't count Tron, which I don't count.

227
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:12,802
Speaker 1: Eh.

228
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

229
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:23,837
Speaker 1: But, yeah, so, even though a whole bunch of fakes and supposed leaks and everything, tonight at midnight, at least, the single is going to be made available, right?

230
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,830
Speaker 1: At midnight or 1

231
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,133
Speaker 1: a.m.,

232
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,060
Speaker 1: I guess, tomorrow.

233
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,719
Speaker 1: So, basically, by the time you listen to this.

234
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:33,180
Speaker 1: And I'm going to download it at that exact time because they got me.

235
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:34,516
Speaker 1: They got me.

236
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,959
Speaker 0: Well, it's good to be gotten sometimes.

237
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:39,140
Speaker 0: Some people deserve my money.

238
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,418
Speaker 0: It's a, you know what it is?

239
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,060
Speaker 1: Unless this is yet another false rumor.

240
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't matter because all that matters is that this is one of a few situations we've had in recent memory of shut up and take my money.

241
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

242
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:51,677
Speaker 1: And then, you know what?

243
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:52,940
Speaker 1: They already took my money.

244
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,320
Speaker 1: I pre-ordered that shit on Amazon.

245
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,318
Speaker 1: I paid real monies.

246
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,580
Speaker 0: All right, so I want to talk a little bit about an issue that primarily only exists in New York.

247
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,999
Speaker 0: Now, this exists in other cities.

248
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:05,939
Speaker 0: This happens in other places.

249
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,059
Speaker 0: But New York is a place that this is endemic to the point that there are competing versions of them.

250
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:13,219
Speaker 0: What?

251
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,280
Speaker 0: Basically, it's hobos who dress up as Disney characters or the like.

252
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,800
Speaker 1: I'm an expert on this because they do this outside my office where I work.

253
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:26,960
Speaker 1: And when I go to play Netrunner, in the deli we play Netrunner, they also eat dinner there.

254
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,720
Speaker 1: And they'll come in, take their costumes off, eat dinner and go back out.

255
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,460
Speaker 1: I'm an expert in these people.

256
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:32,339
Speaker 0: So, here's the deal.

257
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,600
Speaker 0: If you live in New York, New York is just an awesome city.

258
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:38,299
Speaker 0: But it's also a place that tourists come to.

259
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,380
Speaker 1: It's like if Disney World was like, you know, in your living room.

260
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,100
Speaker 1: It's like, "Get the fuck out of here, assholes.

261
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:46,479
Speaker 1: I'm trying to friggin' watch TV and you guys are like riding Space

262
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:46,660
Speaker 1: Mountain.".

263
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,160
Speaker 0: Now, tourism, in the general sense, doesn't bother me.

264
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,720
Speaker 0: Because that really just means people visiting places.

265
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm technically a tourist when I'm in Munich.

266
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,500
Speaker 1: And they give us money to pay for our things, which is less taxes I have to pay, which is nice.

267
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,840
Speaker 0: But the difference is when I run into people who are in a city, and it's not just in New York.

268
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,500
Speaker 0: I mean, when I was in Munich, I saw tourists from other places who were doing this.

269
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:15,920
Speaker 0: They go to a city and they're not used to cities, so they treat the city itself like an amusement park.

270
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:17,880
Speaker 0: Like it exists to entertain them.

271
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,080
Speaker 1: And many businesses taking advantage of them accommodate their behavior.

272
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,500
Speaker 1: And take advantage of their behavior to fleece them of money.

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,979
Speaker 0: Now, luckily, New York is smart.

274
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,040
Speaker 1: Only to bother the rest of us.

275
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,520
Speaker 0: We've basically made ghettos for this activity.

276
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,680
Speaker 1: Yes, tourist ghettos.

277
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:36,259
Speaker 0: Times Square, South Street Seaport, Battery Park.

278
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,380
Speaker 1: Not even Battery Park that much.

279
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:43,499
Speaker 0: The bottom left, the bottom right, like south and east corner of Central Park.

280
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,979
Speaker 1: The World Trade Center, inside the major museums.

281
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:47,248
Speaker 0: Yep.

282
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:48,220
Speaker 0: Empire State Building.

283
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:50,960
Speaker 0: So basically, the tourists only go to these places.

284
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:55,820
Speaker 0: And these places are kind of set up like amusement parks.

285
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,600
Speaker 0: So thus the problem.

286
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:03,160
Speaker 0: If some hobo buys an Elmo costume and puts it on and walks around.

287
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,007
Speaker 1: No, it's not an Elmo costume.

288
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,780
Speaker 1: It's a generic red monster costume.

289
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,356
Speaker 0: It's Elmo.

290
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,019
Speaker 0: I mean, here's a picture of a dude dressed up as Woody taking a leak.

291
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,715
Speaker 1: The Woody costume is a Woody costume.

292
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:15,380
Speaker 1: I've seen that guy.

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,530
Speaker 0: Here's some Hello Kitty.

294
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:17,360
Speaker 0: Here's some Mario.

295
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,540
Speaker 1: Yes, those are clearly.

296
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,700
Speaker 0: Dora the Explorer.

297
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,220
Speaker 1: Yes, many of them are undeniably specific characters.

298
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,620
Speaker 1: But the Cookie Monster and Elmo, you could.

299
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,880
Speaker 0: Scott, that is Cookie Monster.

300
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,979
Speaker 0: You could argue.

301
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,140
Speaker 0: Oh yes, you could.

302
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,270
Speaker 1: That it's Blue Monster.

303
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,160
Speaker 0: You can't argue the Woody.

304
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,739
Speaker 0: Yes, you can.

305
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:33,260
Speaker 1: The Woody cannot be argued.

306
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,280
Speaker 0: That is Cowboy.

307
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:35,099
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

308
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,420
Speaker 1: There is no argument because on the bottom of his shoe it says Andy.

309
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,900
Speaker 1: There is no argument that it's generic Cowboy.

310
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,440
Speaker 0: Depending on the canon, there is a point at which it does not say Andy.

311
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,660
Speaker 1: But the Cookie Monster is so.

312
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,580
Speaker 0: So Scott, if his canon takes place between when it gets painted and the end of the second movie, then there is no Andy there.

313
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:02,040
Speaker 1: If I owned a costume shop, I might be able to sell the Cookie Monster costume with the words Blue Monster on it without the permission of Sesame Street and get away with it.

314
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,820
Speaker 1: I could not legally sell that costume, write Cowboy on it, and get away with it without being sued by Disney.

315
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,520
Speaker 0: Ah, but Scott.

316
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,300
Speaker 1: You wouldn't get away with it.

317
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,922
Speaker 1: It wouldn't matter.

318
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:14,300
Speaker 0: I could buy a straight up Elmo costume because you can buy that.

319
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,460
Speaker 0: There are licensed costumes.

320
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,377
Speaker 1: Yes, but you could not walk around and ask for donations with it without being sued.

321
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,935
Speaker 1: It's not against the law.

322
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,080
Speaker 0: Um, actually, actually.

323
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,145
Speaker 1: There are certain laws.

324
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,339
Speaker 1: There's aggressive panhandling against the law.

325
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,583
Speaker 0: No, no.

326
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:27,200
Speaker 0: So here's what I'm getting at.

327
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:34,580
Speaker 0: It's likely that many of these people can't actually be sued even for that because it's not a crime to wear a costume in public.

328
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:39,360
Speaker 0: It's not even a violation of copyright in many cases unless you're doing a specific performance.

329
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:40,720
Speaker 0: It's really complicated.

330
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,520
Speaker 1: They're using somebody's intellectual property to make money.

331
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:45,860
Speaker 1: They're asking for donations.

332
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,340
Speaker 0: Ah, but if they don't actually ask and it is unsolicited donations.

333
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:50,963
Speaker 1: It's not.

334
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:51,726
Speaker 1: It's solicited.

335
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:54,337
Speaker 1: They have little, like, socks that say donations.

336
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:54,920
Speaker 1: Give me money.

337
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,724
Speaker 0: Ah, but this gets complicated.

338
00:16:56,744 --> 00:17:02,500
Speaker 0: Basically, it's effectively completely unenforceable because technically what these people are doing is they're wearing a costume.

339
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:10,180
Speaker 0: And they're walking around a perfectly public street in a city that actually encourages and allows street performance anyway.

340
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:17,339
Speaker 1: It allows performance, but there's a law, as I said, against aggressive panhandling/begging, right?

341
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,980
Speaker 1: You can stand there and say, give me money.

342
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,137
Speaker 0: Scott, have you read that law?

343
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:21,720
Speaker 0: It is so vague.

344
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,212
Speaker 1: But I can't be like, hey, man, give me some money.

345
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:24,997
Speaker 1: Grab someone.

346
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:25,560
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

347
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,560
Speaker 1: You can't, like, follow someone and keep asking that one person.

348
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,233
Speaker 0: There's a line that is crossed where the police can- Oh, Scott, yeah, but a one, almost impossible to enforce.

349
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,340
Speaker 0: Two, the law's too vague.

350
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,099
Speaker 0: That's not the issue I want to get into.

351
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,760
Speaker 1: If I was a cop, I would just stand there and wait for the guy to do something clearly bad and then get him.

352
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:48,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott, and all the stories indicate that basically unless they do something really bad, which most of them are smart enough not to- Which most of them do.

353
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,570
Speaker 0: No, actually, most of them don't.

354
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,900
Speaker 0: You just see the news about the ones that do.

355
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:52,780
Speaker 0: There's so many of these guys.

356
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, the reason I bring this up, because I think people outside of New York don't really know what happens here.

357
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:02,499
Speaker 0: I don't care about the technicality of the law or how to get rid of them.

358
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,480
Speaker 0: The thing is, people come to New York City thinking it's basically a big amusement park.

359
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:12,480
Speaker 0: They go to the amusement park area, and they see costumed characters.

360
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:22,279
Speaker 0: And because they've never been to a city, and they have no level of common sense or basic cynicism in their fellow human beings, they think these people work for New York City.

361
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:23,820
Speaker 1: For New York City?

362
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:30,120
Speaker 0: These people literally think, these tourists see these costumed characters and think that it is just like Disney World.

363
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:33,560
Speaker 0: They literally do not realize it's hobos.

364
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,071
Speaker 1: Okay.

365
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:39,900
Speaker 1: I know they don't realize it's hobos, but I didn't think that they would believe it's someone working for the city.

366
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,860
Speaker 1: I thought that they would just think it was someone working for Sesame Street or something like that.

367
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,280
Speaker 0: No, they think it's either working for the city, licensed by the city.

368
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,160
Speaker 0: It is an attraction in the city, just like if they go to Bubba Gump Shrimp, or they go to a Broadway show.

369
00:18:54,661 --> 00:19:00,880
Speaker 0: They think it is an actual, licensed, official, blessed part of the city.

370
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:03,860
Speaker 0: And this is why it's a problem.

371
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:06,540
Speaker 0: The problem isn't that there's the laws and all this stuff.

372
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:18,520
Speaker 0: The problem is just the fact that there's a lot of people who basically don't live in cities, don't understand cities, go to cities, and are just rubes waiting to have their money taken from them.

373
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,400
Speaker 1: This is not new in Times Square.

374
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,440
Speaker 1: In the 80s, when we didn't come here, you would play Three Card Monty in Times Square.

375
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:26,380
Speaker 0: We should bring that back.

376
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,196
Speaker 1: Elmo is the new Three Card... If you set up a Three Card Monty, you will be in jail that night.

377
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,120
Speaker 1: I guarantee you.

378
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,920
Speaker 0: I'll bet I could get away with Three Card Monty.

379
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,720
Speaker 1: Where are you going to set up your Three Card Monty?

380
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,340
Speaker 1: Maybe if you set it up in the night market, you can get away with it.

381
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,000
Speaker 0: I would set it up at the 125th Street subway station.

382
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,880
Speaker 1: You would spend the night in jail.

383
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,067
Speaker 0: It would be pretty easy.

384
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,940
Speaker 0: I'd make some money and then I'd disappear.

385
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,700
Speaker 1: At the very least, you would take a ride in the back of a police car.

386
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,000
Speaker 0: I don't think I would get arrested.

387
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,780
Speaker 1: There are cops standing right there all the time.

388
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,620
Speaker 0: Not all the time.

389
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,599
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically Elmo is the new Three Card Monty.

390
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:58,626
Speaker 0: But this is a problem.

391
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,800
Speaker 0: In technology, in a lot of social areas, this problem remains.

392
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,580
Speaker 0: There is a problem that people don't know how to solve.

393
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,439
Speaker 0: They want to solve it by regulating the thing.

394
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:16,620
Speaker 0: I hate to blame victims, but there's a point at which the victims are themselves the problem.

395
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:20,158
Speaker 0: And this exact thing is a perfect example of that.

396
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:26,960
Speaker 1: People wouldn't send spam if no one fucking read it and bought Viagra from it.

397
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,039
Speaker 0: But the fact is, spam is profitable and that's why it exists.

398
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,860
Speaker 1: So if you buy Viagra from spam, you're part of the problem.

399
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,560
Speaker 1: If you give Elmo money, you're part of the problem.

400
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,860
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

401
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,555
Speaker 0: This might be a comedy sketch video.

402
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,620
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

403
00:20:50,542 --> 00:21:00,020
Speaker 0: But I have witnessed this happening legitimately in my life enough times just because I was kind of a musician when I was younger, that this is a phenomenon that does happen.

404
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,439
Speaker 0: There's someone who does know all the lyrics to a song and is going to perform it.

405
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:19,060
Speaker 0: However, due to stage fright, nervousness, or just lack of professionalism, they will blank and forget pretty much all the lyrics to the song the moment they start performing.

406
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,876
Speaker 1: It can happen.

407
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,339
Speaker 0: This is amazing, not just because of...

408
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,820
Speaker 1: Now, if that happens though, why do they continue?

409
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,300
Speaker 1: Why don't they just apologize and leave with dignity?

410
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:38,300
Speaker 0: Because stopping a performance and saying "I forgot the lyrics" and walking off stage has about equal dignity to failing all the way through.

411
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,059
Speaker 1: You could do it with dignity, rather than giving people three minutes of your song to murmur and go...

412
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,080
Speaker 0: Also, Scott, someone who is able to be on top of that is also the kind of person who won't forget the lyrics in the first place.

413
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,558
Speaker 1: This is true.

414
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:55,275
Speaker 0: And there's a separate phenomenon, and you'll notice.

415
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,240
Speaker 0: this happens the most when people are singing the national anthem.

416
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,140
Speaker 0: People will think they know the lyrics to the song, but they don't really.

417
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:13,325
Speaker 0: Or they will think they'll start to murmur words, and their brain tells them that they are singing the words, but really they're going.

418
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:19,148
Speaker 1: "And the rocket's red glare, and it bursting in...".

419
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,660
Speaker 0: They think that other people don't notice.

420
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,125
Speaker 0: I'm so 100% not joking, Scott.

421
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,298
Speaker 1: I think they're trying to hide it and hoping they're getting away with it, and since no one reacted, they think they got away with it.

422
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:42,414
Speaker 0: Afterward, they probably know they didn't get away with it, but while they're singing, they will go murmur, and they do not realize...

423
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,920
Speaker 1: If you do the tiniest bit for a couple syllables, you can get away with it, right?

424
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,819
Speaker 1: Especially if it's, you know, a lot of classic rock guys, you have no idea what the fuck they're saying in those songs, anyway.

425
00:22:57,606 --> 00:23:00,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, the song is originally that way anyway, right?

426
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:03,277
Speaker 1: You can get away with a lot like that, but...

427
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,897
Speaker 0: I feel like you could write one of those...

428
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,657
Speaker 1: Only so much.

429
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:20,641
Speaker 0: We could write a comedy sketch, like Key and Peele style, in the far future, a guy's singing the national anthem, and the official lyrics are... ♪ In the room, in room care ♪ ♪ A member's singing air ♪.

430
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:23,880
Speaker 1: Or a lot of people, they might get a word off.

431
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,939
Speaker 0: Well, watch this video.

432
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:29,381
Speaker 0: ♪ Re-re-re-amore ♪.

433
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:32,560
Speaker 1: No, but they'll get a word off, like, you know, national anthem.

434
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:38,338
Speaker 1: People might not know one sentence, and it's like, "Oh, I thought it was this and

435
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:38,540
Speaker 1: this.".

436
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,538
Speaker 1: No, it's that and that.

437
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,959
Speaker 0: It was close.

438
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:42,760
Speaker 0: I would have that problem.

439
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,839
Speaker 1: And they'll say the wrong word.

440
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:54,180
Speaker 0: I would actually have that problem occasionally in high school, like performing like Macbeth or Hamlet, where I'd be in the middle of a soliloquy, and suddenly I would just forget if I'd already said one of the stanzas.

441
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,298
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Do I just say it again or just skip

442
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:57,399
Speaker 0: it?".

443
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,958
Speaker 0: And I learned from my stagecoach that the answer is always, "Skip

444
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:02,059
Speaker 0: it.".

445
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,680
Speaker 0: Because...

446
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,640
Speaker 1: Saying something twice is worse than missing something.

447
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,540
Speaker 0: Because it stands out way more, except to people who know better.

448
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:08,940
Speaker 0: Exactly.

449
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,339
Speaker 1: And the people who know better already hate you.

450
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,380
Speaker 1: Right, it's Shakespeare, right?

451
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,260
Speaker 1: So, you know, no one understands what you're saying anyway.

452
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,220
Speaker 0: Half the audience is glossing over it anyway.

453
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:18,960
Speaker 1: Exactly, right?

454
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,740
Speaker 1: The people who know it know you fucked up either way.

455
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:22,518
Speaker 1: If you double it...

456
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,058
Speaker 0: Now you fucked up.

457
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,357
Speaker 0: Right.

458
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,120
Speaker 0: Now you fucked up.

459
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:25,680
Speaker 1: They know you fucked up either way.

460
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,879
Speaker 1: They're going to be mad no matter what.

461
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,400
Speaker 1: So if you skip it, it might be noticeable to a person who doesn't know the Shakespeare that you repeated.

462
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:39,879
Speaker 1: But if you skip, they won't know something's missing, just as long as you skip two lines to maintain the pentameter, so it doesn't sound weird.

463
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:45,500
Speaker 0: But anyway, I think for a lot of audiences, you can just make up every other sentence.

464
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,817
Speaker 1: In a Shakespeare, yes.

465
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,859
Speaker 0: And people just wouldn't even know.

466
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,040
Speaker 0: It's like, "Prithee, forsooth, thou art the Romeo to my...".

467
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:51,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

468
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:53,780
Speaker 1: Half the audience, the smart people would leave.

469
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,912
Speaker 0: Smart people would be like, "What the

470
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:55,439
Speaker 0: fuck?".

471
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,436
Speaker 1: And the other half... Everyone else is like, "Why is everyone leaving?

472
00:24:59,456 --> 00:24:59,698
Speaker 1: This is

473
00:24:59,758 --> 00:24:59,980
Speaker 1: great.".

474
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,931
Speaker 0: No, everyone else is nodding like, "Ah,

475
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:04,477
Speaker 0: Shakespeare.".

476
00:25:05,722 --> 00:25:09,080
Speaker 0: But two, this video is great because of the way it's subtitled.

477
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:10,399
Speaker 1: Okay.

478
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:12,358
Speaker 0: So what do you got for me?

479
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:13,640
Speaker 1: Oh, it's your Thing of the Day?

480
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,420
Speaker 0: That was my Thing of the Day.

481
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,638
Speaker 1: We're already Thing of the Day'd, whoa.

482
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,519
Speaker 1: We're already 25 minutes and 20 seconds.

483
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:26,231
Speaker 1: All right, so Harrison Ford, lately that guy, I'm not sure if he's 100% all-ins, but he's still doing some movies, so he's not 100% all-out either.

484
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:32,879
Speaker 0: Well, he's definitely... This might be kind of mean to say, but him, Sean Connery... Connerysey?

485
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,654
Speaker 1: Connerysey?

486
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,580
Speaker 1: Sean Connery.

487
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,979
Speaker 1: Who's that?

488
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,280
Speaker 0: So Harrison Ford, Sean Connery.

489
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,020
Speaker 1: Is that the guy who played James Cookie?

490
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:41,800
Speaker 0: And Tom Cruise?

491
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,900
Speaker 0: And there's some other actors too, but those are three that I've noticed.

492
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:57,118
Speaker 0: In interviews where they're doing a bit, they're spot on, but interviews where they're actually being interviewed, they always seem kind of spacey, like there's no... I don't know if it's just because they do that in interviews or if they're just...

493
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:02,700
Speaker 1: And it's not an on-purpose, like sometimes a person like a Bill Murray might try to pull...

494
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,780
Speaker 0: Are they such a good actor that they lost their real personality?

495
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:08,140
Speaker 0: Is it because they're being interviewed?

496
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:16,800
Speaker 0: I don't know, but they have this sort of like blank expression and thousand yard stare and these really sort of vacuous answers to questions.

497
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,940
Speaker 0: But yet when they're in a character, they're spot on.

498
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,700
Speaker 0: Sean Connery, watching him perform is like... You forget that he's using the same accent no matter who he's playing.

499
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,722
Speaker 0: But then you watch an interview with him and you're like, "Really?

500
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:31,833
Speaker 0: That's the guy that I'm so invested in as an actor?

501
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:32,516
Speaker 0: This

502
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:32,857
Speaker 0: guy?".

503
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:34,939
Speaker 1: Take they, and I'll rape this.

504
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:43,200
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Harrison Ford appears here on the Jimmy Kimmel show, I guess.

505
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,434
Speaker 1: And at first it seems like that awkward thousand yard stare, "Uh oh, this interview is awkward and

506
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:49,838
Speaker 1: weird.".

507
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:57,820
Speaker 1: And he's usually like, if you're going to interview someone like that, you don't want to ask him about... You interview Sean Connery, you don't want to ask him about James Bond.

508
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,480
Speaker 1: You ask him about whatever he's doing now, right?

509
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,880
Speaker 0: Or like we've interviewed people where there's a list, like here's the list of things that I can't talk about, so please don't ask.

510
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,800
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things they can't talk about.

511
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,920
Speaker 1: It's like if someone is super known for one thing, right?

512
00:27:10,123 --> 00:27:12,900
Speaker 1: But they haven't done that thing, that thing is so far in the past.

513
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,260
Speaker 0: So you were in a great work known as Crystal Triangle.

514
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,720
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

515
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:23,679
Speaker 1: If you're talking to Mamuroshi, pretty much any time he talks to anyone, they're asking him about Ghost in the Shell.

516
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:25,800
Speaker 0: But he only wants to talk about the red spectacles.

517
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,560
Speaker 1: Right, he wants to talk about the red spectacles.

518
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,472
Speaker 1: He wants to talk about fucking Pat LeBourne, right?

519
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:34,060
Speaker 1: That's what you should ask him about.

520
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,620
Speaker 1: If you ask him about Ghost in the Shell, everyone has already asked him every possible question there is to ask about Ghost in the Shell.

521
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:43,978
Speaker 1: Everyone has already asked Harrison Ford every question it's possible to ask about Star Wars.

522
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,160
Speaker 0: Mamuroshi, what is the one question no one has ever asked you about Ghost in the Shell?

523
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,480
Speaker 0: That's a good question, but anyway... I will ask him that if I ever have the opportunity to ask him a question.

524
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,794
Speaker 1: He'll say, "No, speak

525
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:54,077
Speaker 1: English.".

526
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:03,740
Speaker 1: Okay, so here they start asking Harrison Ford some Star Wars questions, and then you can see they start making a joke with Star Wars people in the audience that get to ask him questions.

527
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Speaker 0: It's a good joke, the crestfallen look on the first guy.

528
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,315
Speaker 1: Right, it's like there's a guy dressed up as a Jedi, they're like, "No Star Wars

529
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:08,600
Speaker 1: questions.".

530
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,535
Speaker 1: He's like, "Uh...".

531
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,940
Speaker 1: Right, so you can see where they're going with this joke, but still, Harrison Ford is awkward.

532
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:15,713
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Uh, what are they

533
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:16,076
Speaker 1: doing?".

534
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,340
Speaker 1: And then, stick with it through the awkwardness.

535
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,139
Speaker 1: I guarantee there is a payoff.

536
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,332
Speaker 0: This is A+ payoff.

537
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:24,080
Speaker 0: A+ payoff, guaranteed.

538
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:27,699
Speaker 0: This is like one step below Captain Pellew.

539
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:29,780
Speaker 1: It's not quite Captain Pellew.

540
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:30,897
Speaker 0: I said one step below.

541
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,058
Speaker 1: Eh, two steps below.

542
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:34,320
Speaker 0: Eh, well then what would be one step below?

543
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,540
Speaker 1: It's thing-of-the-day worthy.

544
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,480
Speaker 1: It's not all time, we're ever going to remember this again, thing-of-the-day worthy.

545
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 0: No, but it is a particular kind of payoff that is worth it.

546
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:42,300
Speaker 0: Yes.

547
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,699
Speaker 0: Metamoment, which you go through quickly, because we went kind of long on it a couple days ago.

548
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:47,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

549
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,100
Speaker 0: We're going to be at PAX Australia doing some panels.

550
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,580
Speaker 0: We're going to be at Anime Boston doing five panels.

551
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,018
Speaker 1: Kineticon.

552
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,020
Speaker 0: Emily's going to be at Anime Boston doing a panel.

553
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,080
Speaker 0: We're going to be at Kineticon, running the panels department with our friend Kristen, and also doing some panels.

554
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,119
Speaker 0: We're going to be at PAX Prime.

555
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:03,839
Speaker 1: Hell or high water.

556
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:06,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully we're going to be at PAX Dev.

557
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:08,438
Speaker 0: A lot of conventions coming up.

558
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,720
Speaker 1: It's convention season this summer, and we have internets wherever you internet.

559
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,118
Speaker 1: Twitter, Facebook, et cetera.

560
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,180
Speaker 1: Come visit us on the internet, and the Book Club book is The Player of Games by Ian M. Banks.

561
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:19,740
Speaker 1: Read that shit.

562
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,180
Speaker 1: I picked it up again, and I'm tearing through it so fast.

563
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,080
Speaker 1: Book Club episode will probably be, I don't know, next month.

564
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,980
Speaker 0: And specifically, follow both of our YouTube channels.

565
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,340
Speaker 0: Scott's YouTube channel is Netrunner, Netrunner, Netrunner.

566
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,959
Speaker 1: At least for now.

567
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,260
Speaker 1: I also put other stuff in there.

568
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's got good stuff in there.

569
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,880
Speaker 0: He has a time lapse that he has to finish putting together of that game we played at Burning Con.

570
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,039
Speaker 1: Do I?

571
00:29:45,524 --> 00:29:46,199
Speaker 0: You forgot this?

572
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,618
Speaker 0: You said of the time lapse of the Viking thing.

573
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:51,079
Speaker 1: I guess I have that.

574
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,460
Speaker 1: Inheritance?

575
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,819
Speaker 0: People have been asking me when you were going to put that up for months now.

576
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:56,540
Speaker 1: I forgot all about it.

577
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,536
Speaker 1: I'll go look.

578
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:58,039
Speaker 1: I don't know.

579
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,958
Speaker 1: I'll look at my video full here.

580
00:29:59,081 --> 00:29:59,639
Speaker 0: You asked me.

581
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,819
Speaker 0: You made me set up your stupid GoPro in the room.

582
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,878
Speaker 0: You gave me your GoPro for the express purpose of doing this.

583
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:06,799
Speaker 1: I forgot all about that.

584
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:10,359
Speaker 0: Anyway, Scott's YouTube channel has stuff like that.

585
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,079
Speaker 0: My YouTube channel has every panel and lecture we do that we have the time and energy to video.

586
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:19,340
Speaker 0: Also, all of our ongoing shows, like Ignite Presents.

587
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:20,856
Speaker 0: Yeah.

588
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,019
Speaker 1: Watch Utana because he's totally shit.

589
00:30:23,602 --> 00:30:23,713
Speaker 0: Yep.

590
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:27,498
Speaker 0: And after we finish that, we're going to do Ignite Presents something else.

591
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,697
Speaker 1: Break the world show.

592
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:30,920
Speaker 0: For the sake of world revolution.

593
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:31,840
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

594
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,820
Speaker 0: I want to watch more of that shows.

595
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,638
Speaker 0: Let's get on with that.

596
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:37,120
Speaker 0: So anyway, we decided tonight to talk about drugs.

597
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,440
Speaker 1: I feel like this is a show we planned to do on a Thursday a long time ago, but when I searched the site, it wasn't on there.

598
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,060
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm wrong and we did do it, but it wasn't on the site.

599
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,280
Speaker 0: So as an experiment.

600
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,379
Speaker 1: I figure, you know, we're not big drug doers.

601
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:49,494
Speaker 0: I kind of am.

602
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,111
Speaker 1: Yeah.

603
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,299
Speaker 1: What kind of big drugs are you doing?

604
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:52,540
Speaker 0: I take some loratadine.

605
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,180
Speaker 1: You got a table of white powder out in the living room.

606
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,579
Speaker 0: I got loratadine and chromelain sodium on a regular basis, though the latter is non-systemic.

607
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,260
Speaker 1: I want to talk about all, every possible thing.

608
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,120
Speaker 0: I used to have a pretty.

609
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,280
Speaker 1: That would fit under the word drug by any definition.

610
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,980
Speaker 1: The illegal drugs, the medicinal drugs, the everything.

611
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,580
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft.

612
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,226
Speaker 0: Yeah.

613
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:14,740
Speaker 0: I used to have a pretty ratchet addiction to Dymatab.

614
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:15,254
Speaker 1: Ratchet.

615
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,199
Speaker 0: Forumites know what I'm referring to.

616
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,531
Speaker 0: Maybe.

617
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,340
Speaker 0: So do people who follow me on Twitter.

618
00:31:22,312 --> 00:31:22,500
Speaker 0: All right.

619
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,339
Speaker 1: So why don't we start with the cough syrup, right?

620
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,879
Speaker 0: Cough syrup doesn't do shit.

621
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:26,700
Speaker 1: Well, we know.

622
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,720
Speaker 1: So recent studies have shown cough syrup, right?

623
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,599
Speaker 1: Doesn't do shit.

624
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,480
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, I used to get cough syrup all the time, and now I'm pissed because that shit mostly tasted bad, except Dymatab, which tastes awesome.

625
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,560
Speaker 0: When I was a little kid.

626
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,679
Speaker 1: You drink too much Dymatab, you get fucked the fuck up.

627
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,700
Speaker 0: I have on good authority from my parents that I was obsessed with it.

628
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,040
Speaker 0: I love the taste of it so much that when I was sick.

629
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,300
Speaker 1: I didn't love it that much, but it was like, yeah, shit's good.

630
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:53,799
Speaker 0: At least once I found the bottle of Dymatab and would just take it because I like the taste of it.

631
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:54,497
Speaker 1: Whoa.

632
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:54,968
Speaker 1: Whoa.

633
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,060
Speaker 0: It tasted like the strongest, most concentrated grape juice in the world.

634
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,399
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, I actually preferred one thing to Dymatab in the cough syrup category, which is the sort of orange-ish flavored Triaminic.

635
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:08,159
Speaker 0: I never had Triaminic.

636
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,000
Speaker 1: It had citrusy action going on.

637
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,859
Speaker 1: You know I like orange juice.

638
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,139
Speaker 1: This is closer to orange drank though.

639
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,220
Speaker 0: I was all about the Dymatab.

640
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,500
Speaker 1: Much closer to orange drank.

641
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:25,119
Speaker 0: And when I was a little bit older than Nyquil, because my parents learned that if I was really sick, dosing me with Nyquil was the best way to get me to stop bothering them long enough for them to sleep.

642
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:25,712
Speaker 1: Yup.

643
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:29,619
Speaker 1: I used Nyquil more in the high school and college days.

644
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,679
Speaker 0: I was pretty much Dymatab was the go-to drug that my parents would give me when I was sick.

645
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:45,600
Speaker 1: Yup, so anyway, but Nyquil contains decongestants which actually fucking work and do something, as opposed to say, depending on the variety of Robitussin you get, that most likely does nothing.

646
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,280
Speaker 1: At least in terms of cough alleviation.

647
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,360
Speaker 0: Now for much of my life, because I've had allergies, I actually did take allergy drugs.

648
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,599
Speaker 0: I also got allergy shots.

649
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,358
Speaker 1: Never had allergies except for poison ivy.

650
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is an allergy.

651
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,599
Speaker 1: Which I took steroids to get rid of.

652
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,880
Speaker 0: I am currently, to the best of my knowledge, still immune to poison ivy.

653
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,780
Speaker 0: I'm not allergic to it.

654
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:05,919
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

655
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:07,340
Speaker 1: Is it even possible?

656
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,738
Speaker 0: Yes, so here's the deal.

657
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:16,179
Speaker 0: From what I gather, there are some, basically, once you're exposed to it, you're likely to have an extreme sensitivity to it.

658
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,859
Speaker 0: But there are some people who do not react to it the first time or second time or third time they're exposed to it.

659
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,060
Speaker 0: But repeated exposure pretty much guarantees an eventual reaction.

660
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,517
Speaker 0: So there are numerous times as a kid when I was jerk-ass and I would lead my friends in games of tag or hide-and-seek through poison ivy because it didn't affect me.

661
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:44,380
Speaker 0: And apparently, if I keep doing that, basically any time I'm exposed to poison ivy, there's a pretty good chance I will have a reaction.

662
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,240
Speaker 0: But up to this point, every time I've been exposed, I've had zero reaction.

663
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,800
Speaker 1: I am reading a Snopes about poison ivy immunity, but it is a Snopes forum thread and not a Snopes post.

664
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:54,858
Speaker 0: Oh, the Snopes post?

665
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,779
Speaker 1: I will research this off the show.

666
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,361
Speaker 0: All right.

667
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:15,699
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I took allergy medicine pretty much every day for most of my childhood because that was the only way to be able to not be horribly congested 100% of the time because I was allergic mostly to things that were in the air year-round, like mold spores in buildings.

668
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,500
Speaker 0: And a ragweed, so in the spring that was awesome.

669
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,699
Speaker 0: But I took this thing called, what was it called?

670
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,527
Speaker 0: Rhinocort?

671
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:24,279
Speaker 0: Not Rhinocort.

672
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,440
Speaker 0: I don't remember the name of the drug anymore, but they discontinued it because of its somewhat egregious side effects.

673
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:31,859
Speaker 0: and now I take loratadine.

674
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,099
Speaker 1: I thought you were using Nasalcrom.

675
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,300
Speaker 0: Nasalcrom is a completely separate drug that I take in conjunction with loratadine.

676
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,699
Speaker 1: Why don't you talk about Nasalcrom?

677
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,920
Speaker 0: All right, so Nasalcrom is chromolyne sodium, I believe?

678
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,598
Speaker 1: Something like that.

679
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,560
Speaker 0: It's a non-systemic drug, meaning it doesn't really have any systemic effects in the body.

680
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:55,400
Speaker 0: It literally just binds to the mast cells that allow the allergic reaction to happen.

681
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,980
Speaker 1: So it's almost like using a physical thing, like instead of spraying something in your ear that would chemically affect, right?

682
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,978
Speaker 1: It's just like plugging your ear.

683
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,480
Speaker 1: It's like a physical thing of block the nose allergy part physically.

684
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:15,560
Speaker 0: From what I have read, it prevents the cells in the nose that will cause the allergic reaction from sort of firing or exploding or releasing the histamine.

685
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:23,020
Speaker 0: And it has a few other effects too, but because it's non-systemic you can just take a ton of it and you basically spray it in your nose like four times a day.

686
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,707
Speaker 0: Smells the worst.

687
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:27,980
Speaker 0: The worst.

688
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,260
Speaker 0: Good God, does it smell like a butt.

689
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,599
Speaker 1: So why is it hard to get?

690
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:39,439
Speaker 0: Because apparently it's not popular in the United States because you have to take it four times a day and because it smells like shit.

691
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,560
Speaker 0: So more people would rather take other allergy drugs that aren't as effective and have more side effects because they don't have to take them as often.

692
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,620
Speaker 1: Or maybe they just don't know about Nasalcom because it's not in the store and it's not marketed.

693
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,120
Speaker 0: I order my Nasalcom on Amazon because I've never found a pharmacy in New York that carries it.

694
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,720
Speaker 1: I mean, there's freaking commercials for like, you know, whatever, all those, you know, loratadines all over the place, right?

695
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,860
Speaker 1: But you never see a commercial for Nasalcom.

696
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:09,640
Speaker 0: Well, I don't want to get into the like drug patent name brand versus generic.

697
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,460
Speaker 1: No, that's not.

698
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,617
Speaker 0: That's like a, that's an issue I would want to get someone else on the show with us to talk about because I only know so much.

699
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:21,820
Speaker 0: But at least in terms of this exact drug, it is super effective.

700
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,274
Speaker 1: All right, so my favorite...

701
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,420
Speaker 0: And because it's non systemic, I can take it at the same time as taking an antihistamine.

702
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,740
Speaker 1: So my favorite over the counter medicines are, number one, I'll just start at the best one.

703
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,240
Speaker 1: Sephacol.

704
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,020
Speaker 0: Sephacol is bullshit.

705
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,899
Speaker 1: Sephacol is awesome.

706
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,500
Speaker 0: Fuck Sephacol.

707
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,740
Speaker 1: Sephacol is so sweet.

708
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 0: I have never had a good experience with Sephacol.

709
00:36:42,964 --> 00:36:43,218
Speaker 1: Awesome.

710
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,460
Speaker 0: When I have a sore throat, it doesn't make me feel any better.

711
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,980
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't make you feel better.

712
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,480
Speaker 1: It just completely numbs your fucking throat.

713
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,220
Speaker 1: It's like that shit...

714
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, that feels way worse than just having a sore throat.

715
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,100
Speaker 1: Oh no, it's like the stuff that Dennis gives you before giving you the Novocain shot.

716
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,880
Speaker 1: So the Novocain shot itself hurts less.

717
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:58,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, shit sucks.

718
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:03,559
Speaker 1: And it just like numbs your whole throat and makes it tingle instead of feeling...

719
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,660
Speaker 0: In fact, my game master in high school for Dungeons and Dragons was kind of addicted to Sephacol because...

720
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:09,523
Speaker 1: What?

721
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:10,560
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

722
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:11,537
Speaker 0: So here's why.

723
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:15,600
Speaker 0: It wasn't like us playing D&D now or Burning Wheel now.

724
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,440
Speaker 0: We have like a three hour, four hour session.

725
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,560
Speaker 0: We would play D&D all day every Sunday.

726
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:20,980
Speaker 1: Okay.

727
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,939
Speaker 0: He'd start to lose his voice by like the seventh hour.

728
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:26,860
Speaker 0: So he'd start Sephacol in to keep going.

729
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:27,484
Speaker 0: Wrong.

730
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:27,927
Speaker 0: Bad move.

731
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:28,712
Speaker 1: Bad move.

732
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,482
Speaker 0: You know what?

733
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,198
Speaker 0: Good move because I was a player and I didn't want the game to end.

734
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Sephacol... You're not supposed to take that much of it.

735
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:36,800
Speaker 1: It could fuck you up.

736
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:38,920
Speaker 1: And two, I will only use a Sephacol.

737
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,740
Speaker 1: Sephacol is like the nuke, right?

738
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:44,120
Speaker 1: It's like the strongest possible cough drop you can buy.

739
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,680
Speaker 1: I will use one if like a sore throat keeps me from going to sleep.

740
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,993
Speaker 1: During the day, I will use Ricola.

741
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:58,220
Speaker 0: So I have not had since childhood a sore throat that was not caused by some form of post nasal drip.

742
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,640
Speaker 0: Flu's and colds, the sore throat is almost always post nasal drip and not a direct thing in the throat.

743
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,060
Speaker 1: I've had a few directs in the throat because the throat will hurt, will be the first symptom before the nose or anything else is even bothering.

744
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,239
Speaker 0: In my experience, that's usually an unnoticed thick post nasal drip.

745
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:15,220
Speaker 0: Possible.

746
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:23,719
Speaker 0: Because I've found that if I ever get even the slightest hint of a sore throat, I immediately that night take a Mucinex-D.

747
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,164
Speaker 1: Mucinex-D.

748
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:27,733
Speaker 1: Ignore those other Mucinex letters.

749
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:29,660
Speaker 1: Mucinex-D is the real deal.

750
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,920
Speaker 1: Those other letters are useful for certain situations.

751
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,380
Speaker 1: Babies.

752
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,360
Speaker 0: No, so here's the situation.

753
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,120
Speaker 1: They don't make meth.

754
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:48,640
Speaker 0: If you have an actual cough, in fact, like something that causes coughing, the Mucinex that is a cough suppressant, a real one, and a demuculent is pretty boss.

755
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,916
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that's D.

756
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:54,220
Speaker 0: No, the D is pseudofedrine and a demuculent.

757
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,018
Speaker 1: All right, let me look.

758
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,459
Speaker 0: Pseudofedrine and guaifenesin.

759
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,322
Speaker 1: Right.

760
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,440
Speaker 1: So the one without pseudofedrine.

761
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,024
Speaker 0: No, that's BS.

762
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:03,215
Speaker 0: You don't want the one that's just guaifenesin.

763
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:04,099
Speaker 0: Guaifenesin.

764
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:07,388
Speaker 1: Okay, so they've got Mucinex, which is multisymptom cold.

765
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:10,155
Speaker 1: They've got Mucinex Sinus Max, which is new.

766
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:11,820
Speaker 1: Pressure and pain.

767
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,830
Speaker 1: Mucinex-D, which is the awesome one.

768
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:15,240
Speaker 1: Mucinex-DM, which is Team Mucus.

769
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,606
Speaker 0: All right, let's see what's in the Sinus Max.

770
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:17,812
Speaker 0: Whoa.

771
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:17,993
Speaker 0: Whoa.

772
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:20,460
Speaker 1: What's in that shit?

773
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,312
Speaker 0: So, Mucinex Sinus Max, I've been taking already when I get sick.

774
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,379
Speaker 0: All it is, is the old Mucinex-D.

775
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,408
Speaker 0: So it's guaifenesin and, nope, it's bullshit.

776
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,254
Speaker 0: It doesn't have real pseudofedrine in it.

777
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:33,300
Speaker 0: It has that fake new one that doesn't work as well.

778
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:36,260
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's basically Mucinex-D with fake pseudofedrine.

779
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,978
Speaker 0: And with Tylenol in it.

780
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,363
Speaker 1: Oh.

781
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:45,757
Speaker 0: So when I get super sick, I take the Mucinex that is guaifenesin, which is an expectorant.

782
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:46,920
Speaker 0: It thins your mucus.

783
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,938
Speaker 1: I think it's guaifenesin.

784
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:51,627
Speaker 0: I've heard doctors say it so many different ways.

785
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:52,369
Speaker 0: I don't care.

786
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:55,457
Speaker 0: It is G-U-A-I-F-E-N-E-S-I-N.

787
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,209
Speaker 0: So you take that, it thins your mucus.

788
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,080
Speaker 0: The way it does that is pretty cool, but I don't want to get into that.

789
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:03,590
Speaker 0: It has something to do with it.

790
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:04,798
Speaker 0: It irritates your body.

791
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,300
Speaker 1: You have to drink a lot of fucking water if you take that, because it basically thins your mucus with water, so you will dehydrate the fuck.

792
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,719
Speaker 1: It even says in the instructions, "Drink a glass of water with

793
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:13,860
Speaker 1: this.".

794
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,732
Speaker 0: Now kids, many times you've read a drug, it's like, "Drink with a glass of

795
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:17,953
Speaker 0: water."

796
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,598
Speaker 0: And you're like, "Whatevs, you drink it with soda or

797
00:40:19,638 --> 00:40:19,899
Speaker 0: something.".

798
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:22,779
Speaker 0: No, don't fuck around with guaifenesin.

799
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:31,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, drink water, because it's going to use all this water from your body to thin out the mucus, and so it won't be all thick and globby, and you can cough it up more easily.

800
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:35,788
Speaker 1: But the key- If you drink just a ton of water with it, drink three glasses- -is it's coupled with pseudofedrine.

801
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:38,340
Speaker 0: Now, I'm going to look up- Great for meth.

802
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:38,881
Speaker 0: Yes.

803
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:45,520
Speaker 0: Pseudofedrine is, as far as I can tell, one of the most effective decongestants humans have ever discovered.

804
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:46,077
Speaker 1: Yes.

805
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:53,040
Speaker 0: The fact that we have all these troubles with pseudofedrine is a separate show that we've probably talked about a lot.

806
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,829
Speaker 0: But pseudofedrine is the real deal.

807
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,760
Speaker 0: Don't let anyone give you that phenylephrine bullshit.

808
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:00,840
Speaker 1: Are you sure that stuff's no good?

809
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,487
Speaker 0: I will look it up again to be sure while we talk about other drugs.

810
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:10,000
Speaker 0: But Sinus Max is just that plus Tylenol, which is what I already do when I'm super sick.

811
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:16,060
Speaker 0: Because I know enough about the drugs from the doctors that I'll take the guaifenesin and pseudofedrine together.

812
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,240
Speaker 0: Separately, I take the Benadryl, and then separately, I take the aspirin, because none of those interact directly.

813
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,660
Speaker 1: See, Rim is the kind where if he is sick, we'll take tons of drugs.

814
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,949
Speaker 0: Because if I'm sick anyway, I'm not stupid.

815
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:34,118
Speaker 0: I don't need my body to keep saying, "Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain.

816
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:34,479
Speaker 0: Don't go

817
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:34,800
Speaker 0: anywhere.".

818
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,750
Speaker 1: I take as few drugs as possible, right?

819
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,860
Speaker 1: So if I have a headache, I will only take a Tylenol if it's so bad.

820
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,880
Speaker 0: If I have a headache, I take an aspirin immediately.

821
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,722
Speaker 1: I do not.

822
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:50,160
Speaker 1: In fact, I don't take aspirin ever, because my liver is in much better shape than my stomach.

823
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,500
Speaker 0: Oh, Scott, aspirin does not hurt your liver.

824
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,300
Speaker 1: It hurts your stomach.

825
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, not your liver.

826
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,020
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, is that my liver is in better shape than my stomach.

827
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:00,400
Speaker 1: So I don't want to take an aspirin, I'll take a Tylenol, because Tylenol hurts liver.

828
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,600
Speaker 0: Your stomach is very powerful, but if it gets past that point, it is no longer happy.

829
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,720
Speaker 1: So I would rather risk liver damage, because I don't drink any alcohols, than risk stomach damage.

830
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,740
Speaker 0: Well, I've been drinking alcohol continuously over the course of this show, partly because we're talking about drugs.

831
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:26,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually just finished a big glass of, basically it's a sort of pear liqueur, or a pear wine, and now I'm drinking Applejack.

832
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,403
Speaker 1: Okay.

833
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:28,960
Speaker 1: So you can drink two alcohols.

834
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:30,505
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:31,374
Speaker 0: Applejack's pretty boss.

836
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:32,632
Speaker 1: Hobo.

837
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:34,919
Speaker 0: Hobos don't drink Applejack.

838
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:36,660
Speaker 1: Anyway.

839
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:37,683
Speaker 0: Anyway.

840
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,140
Speaker 0: But, what were we talking about?

841
00:42:40,702 --> 00:42:42,280
Speaker 1: How I take as few drugs as possible.

842
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, I take a lot of drugs.

843
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,320
Speaker 0: Because I'm already sick, I know I'm sick.

844
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,740
Speaker 0: The point of all that pain is so I don't go ride my bike, or box anybody.

845
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,445
Speaker 0: Or run around.

846
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:55,660
Speaker 0: Or start yelling at people, or doing karaoke.

847
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,700
Speaker 0: So I already know I'm sick, why continue to feel bad?

848
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,564
Speaker 1: I don't continue to feel bad.

849
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:06,280
Speaker 1: It is such a, you know, the suffering of being sick is so slight, and the drugs help so little.

850
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,984
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

851
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:09,240
Speaker 0: The drugs have a huge effect if you're actually sick.

852
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:09,676
Speaker 1: No.

853
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:19,118
Speaker 0: If I'm sick and I have a gross, like a terrible headache, as a result of some sickness, and I take some Tylenol or some aspirin, that headache literally disappears.

854
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:19,960
Speaker 0: It is gone.

855
00:43:20,103 --> 00:43:20,578
Speaker 1: Not so.

856
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:21,487
Speaker 0: 100% gone.

857
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,744
Speaker 1: Not for me.

858
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:25,100
Speaker 1: It disappears at about the same rate as if I did nothing.

859
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:26,824
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

860
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:31,644
Speaker 0: Maybe, I don't know if it's physiology or pain tolerance, but if I have a headache- I haven't exactly measured this, right?

861
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:38,760
Speaker 1: But it's not like, I don't, like, if I take a Tylenol, I don't suddenly, you know, feel like this magical pain go away experience.

862
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:40,143
Speaker 0: See, I do.

863
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:43,013
Speaker 0: If I take Tylenol, my pain within an hour is literally gone.

864
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,340
Speaker 1: Is there like a moment where you feel like, whoosh, like the headache goes away?

865
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,680
Speaker 0: No, it's a slow, sort of like slowly goes away.

866
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,339
Speaker 1: But can you feel it and notice it?

867
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:53,039
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

868
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:53,978
Speaker 1: I can't notice it.

869
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,900
Speaker 0: Because I also notice when it wears off.

870
00:43:57,121 --> 00:43:57,598
Speaker 1: I don't notice.

871
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:04,680
Speaker 0: The last time I was sick, you know, I took Tylenol partly because I was vomiting so much I didn't want to bother my stomach.

872
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:05,338
Speaker 0: Yeah.

873
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:08,275
Speaker 0: Also, I was drinking no alcohol at the time because I was taking Sudafed.

874
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,640
Speaker 0: So I figured, all right, I'll take Aspirin and I'll take Tylenol.

875
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,699
Speaker 0: I'm doing the Tylenol thing.

876
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,420
Speaker 0: And right about when it's time to take the next dose of Tylenol is right about when I would wake up with the splitting headache having returned.

877
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:22,865
Speaker 1: See, I don't, I just don't like.

878
00:44:22,905 --> 00:44:27,040
Speaker 1: if I have a headache and I don't take anything, it goes away and I just don't notice when it went away.

879
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:30,960
Speaker 1: If I take a Tylenol, it goes away and I don't notice when it went away.

880
00:44:31,122 --> 00:44:32,139
Speaker 1: So what's the difference?

881
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:33,640
Speaker 1: I don't notice when it went away.

882
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,340
Speaker 1: Either way, I survive.

883
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,720
Speaker 1: I have pain for a period and then it goes away.

884
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,319
Speaker 1: So what's the difference if I take the drug or don't?

885
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:47,000
Speaker 1: If I took the drug and like in a short span of time felt like it's a short span of time, it's usually like I noticed it working.

886
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,959
Speaker 1: I might take it more.

887
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,479
Speaker 0: It seems to be about 15 to 20 minutes tops before the significant effect.

888
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,480
Speaker 1: If it works, I don't notice it working.

889
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:54,999
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

890
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:56,438
Speaker 1: So there you go.

891
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:00,420
Speaker 1: That's why, you know, and even if it did work, you know, I wouldn't take it.

892
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,440
Speaker 1: I still, you know, would take as few drugs as possible.

893
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:05,079
Speaker 0: I'm a transhumanist.

894
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,420
Speaker 0: I've decided that I would like to modify my body to suit my needs.

895
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:11,340
Speaker 0: I would rather not experience superfluous pain.

896
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:21,240
Speaker 1: I also would rather not experience pain, but I also do not really want to, you know, chemically modify myself as little as possible.

897
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,940
Speaker 0: But also I've read numerous studies saying that regular intake of aspirin specifically.

898
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,118
Speaker 1: Good for hearts.

899
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:35,300
Speaker 0: Not just hearts, but in general may actually decrease some of the effects of aging because it reduces stress on your body overall.

900
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,300
Speaker 1: You know, people always talk about this stress, right?

901
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:40,840
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, OK, how do you measure this stress?

902
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,079
Speaker 1: What does stress mean?

903
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,380
Speaker 0: A release of stress hormones that causes low levels of inflammation.

904
00:45:45,881 --> 00:45:48,219
Speaker 1: Like which ones, you know, released where, how much?

905
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,960
Speaker 1: You know, everyone just always says, oh, you've got a lot of stress.

906
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,620
Speaker 1: You're going to die.

907
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,257
Speaker 1: It's not good.

908
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,320
Speaker 0: Scott, there are studies that show specific stress hormones.

909
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:04,880
Speaker 0: Increases in low level, widespread systemic inflammation, which itself is correlated with early death and cancer.

910
00:46:05,705 --> 00:46:06,658
Speaker 1: But do I have this?

911
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:08,295
Speaker 0: I don't know.

912
00:46:09,624 --> 00:46:10,980
Speaker 1: I certainly don't feel like I do.

913
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,860
Speaker 1: I'm pretty chilled out most of the time.

914
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:18,380
Speaker 1: So, yeah, don't really need to be chilled out anymore.

915
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:24,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are tons of studies questioning whether or not phenylephrine has any significant decongestant effect.

916
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,700
Speaker 1: And there it is, a Wikipedia substitute for pseudofedrine.

917
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:29,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are.

918
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:30,404
Speaker 0: there are.

919
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,433
Speaker 0: there are tons of pretty legit articles.

920
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:34,120
Speaker 0: I'm clicking through now about this.

921
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:41,999
Speaker 0: But basically, there seems to be a consensus that phenylephrine has almost no effect as a decongestant.

922
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:44,899
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, pseudofedrine has an extreme effect.

923
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:46,940
Speaker 1: Pseudofedrine 100 percent works.

924
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:48,259
Speaker 1: Like I noticed that shit working.

925
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you're sucked up, you take pseudofed.

926
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,320
Speaker 1: Like I'll be full of phlegms.

927
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,400
Speaker 0: Your nose is like stopped, like just done, like the faucet just shuts off.

928
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:55,838
Speaker 1: Yep.

929
00:46:56,241 --> 00:47:00,119
Speaker 0: And you feel awesome because it's kind of a stimulant and you have awesome dreams when you take it.

930
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:01,399
Speaker 1: I don't really know what it is.

931
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:01,675
Speaker 1: Really?

932
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:03,240
Speaker 1: I have awesome dreams.

933
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,560
Speaker 1: I can't really figure out what causes me to have awesome dreams.

934
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,479
Speaker 1: I've had some lately.

935
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,139
Speaker 1: They're sort of going away now.

936
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:09,600
Speaker 1: But I don't know what they correlate with.

937
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,302
Speaker 1: Oh, what was?

938
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:17,000
Speaker 0: I just read a study kind of randomly about a certain kind of cheese that people who eat it.

939
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,980
Speaker 0: There is a statistically significant increase in vivid remembered dreams.

940
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:22,940
Speaker 1: Let's get that cheese.

941
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll try to find it.

942
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,819
Speaker 0: I'll click around the cheese shop.

943
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:26,819
Speaker 1: And you know what?

944
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,430
Speaker 1: They won't have it.

945
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:29,960
Speaker 0: What do they have?

946
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:30,860
Speaker 0: Have you got cheddar?

947
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:31,536
Speaker 1: No.

948
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,520
Speaker 0: Remember when we wanted we were trying to come up with a cheese shop bit to do with that failed late show of PAX?

949
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:38,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

950
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:39,539
Speaker 0: I'm glad we didn't attempt that.

951
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:42,020
Speaker 1: I wish you would have just not attempted anything.

952
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think if we had we attempted that bit, that would have been yet another nail in the coffin.

953
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,480
Speaker 1: That shit was so bad.

954
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,780
Speaker 0: That was our worst public failure.

955
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,200
Speaker 1: If I could forget something in my life, I would forget that.

956
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:53,799
Speaker 0: We learned from it, though.

957
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:55,180
Speaker 1: I learned a lot.

958
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:55,998
Speaker 1: Don't do that again.

959
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:58,559
Speaker 0: No, I learned things beyond that.

960
00:47:58,843 --> 00:47:59,499
Speaker 1: Don't do that again.

961
00:47:59,580 --> 00:47:59,879
Speaker 1: Again.

962
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:01,179
Speaker 0: Have a backup plan.

963
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:02,898
Speaker 0: Have an escape hatch.

964
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:05,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

965
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:05,599
Speaker 1: All right.

966
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:06,240
Speaker 0: Anyway.

967
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:06,822
Speaker 1: Let's.

968
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:11,300
Speaker 1: I think people want us to talk at least a little bit about the illegal drugs because that's what they like.

969
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,240
Speaker 1: Well, so I know some of our listeners do the illegal drugs and some do not to varying degrees.

970
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,180
Speaker 0: I know a number of our friends do illegal drugs on a semi-regular basis.

971
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:21,035
Speaker 1: Many do.

972
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, many do.

973
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:22,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, many do.

974
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,900
Speaker 0: Many of them might not mention it to you just because they know that you don't do at all.

975
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,120
Speaker 1: What do they care if I know or don't know?

976
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,640
Speaker 1: What am I going to do?

977
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,399
Speaker 1: Call the cops on them?

978
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:30,800
Speaker 1: I don't know.

979
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,375
Speaker 0: There's a perception that you're kind of judgmental.

980
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,900
Speaker 1: If someone had cocaine in the house, yeah, maybe I would call the cops on you.

981
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,920
Speaker 1: But if you told me, yeah, I smoke weed once in a while, it'd be like, so?

982
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,079
Speaker 1: I don't care what you do.

983
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,659
Speaker 0: I haven't had weed in a long time, but I have smoked marijuana on a few occasions at RIT.

984
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:54,120
Speaker 0: And it was an overall pleasant experience, not unlike drinking alcohol in terms of the gravity of the effect.

985
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:55,718
Speaker 1: I have not done that.

986
00:48:56,661 --> 00:48:58,480
Speaker 0: Well, you've never had really alcohol either.

987
00:48:59,006 --> 00:48:59,215
Speaker 1: No.

988
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,960
Speaker 1: I'm philosophically opposed.

989
00:49:02,646 --> 00:49:03,979
Speaker 1: I don't care what someone else does.

990
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:11,380
Speaker 0: Now, I'm curious why, like, why philosophically are you opposed to controlled modification of one's own body?

991
00:49:12,322 --> 00:49:18,360
Speaker 1: I do not view it as controlled altercation, altering whatever of your body.

992
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,920
Speaker 1: I view it as artificial mind altering and artificial feeling modification.

993
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,281
Speaker 1: Yeah.

994
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:33,640
Speaker 0: So what if we developed a technology, a chip you can implant into like the base of your skull that would have a button that you could hit.

995
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:37,920
Speaker 0: And for the next hour, it would give you preternatural powers of concentration.

996
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:46,040
Speaker 1: It depends on the specific workings, but most likely I would be equally philosophically opposed.

997
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:48,079
Speaker 1: And I wouldn't care if anyone else did that shit.

998
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:50,320
Speaker 0: Now, it's interesting because I would not do that shit.

999
00:49:50,461 --> 00:49:53,220
Speaker 0: I am literally the opposite of philosophically opposed.

1000
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:54,980
Speaker 0: I seek that out.

1001
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:56,778
Speaker 0: I am a transhumanist to the end.

1002
00:49:57,801 --> 00:50:06,400
Speaker 1: I would like a robot body, but I would not want to have any sort of mind alteration that is artificial in any way.

1003
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,640
Speaker 0: But what is artificial versus natural?

1004
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,460
Speaker 0: Your body releases all sorts of dopamine and serotonin all over the place based on your activities.

1005
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,039
Speaker 0: You masturbate on occasion and/or have sex.

1006
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:23,020
Speaker 0: And if you do that thing, you're just telling your body to release a bunch of dopamine.

1007
00:50:23,882 --> 00:50:32,440
Speaker 1: It does, but it is doing that in reaction to activities that I am doing and not, say, chemicals that I am inducing.

1008
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,182
Speaker 0: Activities that I'm doing.

1009
00:50:33,222 --> 00:50:40,340
Speaker 0: I'm consuming a chemical rather than moving my hand up and down across my penis repeatedly for one to twenty minutes.

1010
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:47,118
Speaker 1: I understand that, for example, even food that is not alcoholic in nature can have an effect.

1011
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,420
Speaker 0: So Scott, if that cheese that I was just talking about is legit.

1012
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,440
Speaker 0: That has a blurry line.

1013
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:52,424
Speaker 0: So Scott, that cheese.

1014
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:54,613
Speaker 0: If this is legit, I'll try to Google for it.

1015
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,420
Speaker 0: Will you continue to eat that cheese?

1016
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:57,620
Speaker 1: It depends.

1017
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,179
Speaker 0: Depends on what?

1018
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,800
Speaker 1: It's mostly a subjective judgment of strength.

1019
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:04,264
Speaker 1: Strength?

1020
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:06,160
Speaker 0: So it's just the degree of modification?

1021
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:09,676
Speaker 1: I mean, everything has degrees at which it is...

1022
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,616
Speaker 0: Oh wow, there is a lot of data on this.

1023
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:15,740
Speaker 0: I'll continue to research.

1024
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,639
Speaker 1: It's pretty interesting, yeah.

1025
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,240
Speaker 0: It appears to be Stilton is the cheese.

1026
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:29,920
Speaker 1: But really, what it is, if you're trying to discuss the semantic difference, and I'll admit, it's kind of a blurry, non-exact, sort of bullshit line.

1027
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:47,680
Speaker 0: Thus, I say philosophically, I, as a nominally conscious being with some nominal sense that I have agency, am willing to modify my own consciousness in order to achieve ends that I believe are desirable.

1028
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:56,520
Speaker 1: I view it from farther away, and I see that there are some people in this world, you know, who are crazy drug people.

1029
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,240
Speaker 1: And clearly there are many responsible drug people who are not crazy and there's nothing wrong.

1030
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,920
Speaker 1: Well, I mean... And if they do that...

1031
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,140
Speaker 0: We've seen the two complete ends of that spectrum at RIT.

1032
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,520
Speaker 1: I have seen all of those spectrums in my entire life.

1033
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,078
Speaker 0: From the Dammit Duane to our friend who's...

1034
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,400
Speaker 1: From the hobo lying in the street looking for heroin...

1035
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:22,840
Speaker 0: To the guy who's experimenting with drugs on himself and keeping logs of it, trying to design designer drugs, getting an MBA from RIT to run his drug business.

1036
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:28,020
Speaker 1: To someone who smokes weed once in a while because, perfectly acceptable reason, they just like it, whatever, right?

1037
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:35,117
Speaker 1: And the way I see it is that you are getting enjoyment, but you are not doing anything.

1038
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:36,360
Speaker 1: that is in itself.

1039
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:41,720
Speaker 1: Basically, you are getting a feeling that does not match up with anything.

1040
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,745
Speaker 1: It matches up with what?

1041
00:52:42,765 --> 00:52:43,891
Speaker 1: Setting a plant on fire?

1042
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:45,440
Speaker 1: That makes no sense, right?

1043
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:51,120
Speaker 1: I can get so much enjoyment from, say, playing board game, right?

1044
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:58,340
Speaker 1: Or going to convention, or going to concert, or watching movie, or any of those kinds of activities.

1045
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,400
Speaker 1: And there is seemingly... That's awesome.

1046
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:13,060
Speaker 1: There is an actual, you know, correlation there between... Yes, there is an enjoyable activity that I am doing, as opposed to... It's almost cheating to go and get the feeling without the activity.

1047
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:19,720
Speaker 0: So cheating activity, you're putting a lot of really personal projected values out here.

1048
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,900
Speaker 1: It's a personal philosophy, that's why I don't tell... I don't get mad if someone else doesn't follow it.

1049
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,458
Speaker 0: Oh, I know, but I'm saying... That's just how I do.

1050
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,260
Speaker 0: But I'm just pointing out...

1051
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:27,660
Speaker 1: I don't care what anyone else do.

1052
00:53:28,062 --> 00:53:28,698
Speaker 0: Like, for example...

1053
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,719
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say you're a bad person, you're drugged up.

1054
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:36,740
Speaker 0: Without a robot body, without a robot brain, you're gonna have this prone to failure organic blob in your robot body?

1055
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,100
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, even Ghost in the Shell, you have a real brain in your cyborg body.

1056
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,479
Speaker 0: Real brain, only for now.

1057
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:48,880
Speaker 0: That real brain... Notice one of the underlying themes of Ghost in the Shell is that that real brain is a huge problem.

1058
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:51,440
Speaker 0: That's the cause of all the failures.

1059
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,220
Speaker 0: All those... There's that sclerosis that happens, that disease they talk about.

1060
00:53:55,561 --> 00:54:00,600
Speaker 0: It's all because that brain is the weakest link in a modern human with cybernetics.

1061
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:08,898
Speaker 1: To counter your anime with another anime, I will bring in the Galaxy Express 3-9, where the people are immortal with their 100% robot bodies.

1062
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,460
Speaker 0: And it's awesome to be the immortal robots.

1063
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,304
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

1064
00:54:12,324 --> 00:54:14,741
Speaker 1: It's because their robot bodies are 100%.

1065
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:15,920
Speaker 0: Count Mecha was having an awesome time.

1066
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,080
Speaker 1: And because life has no value when there is an infinite supply of it, right?

1067
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:23,280
Speaker 0: I would argue that that is probably not actually true.

1068
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:24,518
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1069
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,660
Speaker 0: Because now you're saying that life had value to begin with.

1070
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,199
Speaker 0: It does.

1071
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,720
Speaker 1: If I don't value life, why am I not just gonna kill myself?

1072
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,820
Speaker 0: But what is life?

1073
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,400
Speaker 0: Are you saying that... Why is life actually valued less if you're immortal?

1074
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,740
Speaker 1: Because anything with greater supply has less value per unit.

1075
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:50,400
Speaker 0: Because the loss of an immortal life is a far greater loss of agency than a loss of a limited life.

1076
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,100
Speaker 1: But if you can't die, then you won't... Now, I know I'm gonna die, so I'm in a hurry.

1077
00:54:55,623 --> 00:54:58,160
Speaker 1: I'm trying to do as much as I can with what little I've got.

1078
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:03,499
Speaker 0: Maybe being in a hurry is why humans keep fucking things up.

1079
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,139
Speaker 0: If we had that long perspective...

1080
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,079
Speaker 1: Then we wouldn't even give a shit, though.

1081
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,319
Speaker 1: We only give a shit.

1082
00:55:10,162 --> 00:55:12,760
Speaker 1: And you can only fuck up because it's limited.

1083
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,340
Speaker 1: If it was unlimited, there would be no such thing as fucking up.

1084
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,799
Speaker 1: Because you have all the time in the world.

1085
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,360
Speaker 0: Also, did Count Mecha not appear to be having an awesome time until he was murdered by that kid?

1086
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:27,620
Speaker 1: Count Mecha was an asshole who friggin' murdered his mom like a deer and hung her on the wall.

1087
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,420
Speaker 0: Yes, he was an asshole, but look at it from his perspective.

1088
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,312
Speaker 0: He's having an awesome time.

1089
00:55:32,373 --> 00:55:33,180
Speaker 0: It's great for him.

1090
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,300
Speaker 1: And he became such an evil fucker because he put no value on life.

1091
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,480
Speaker 0: How do you know he wasn't like that when he was a human?

1092
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,537
Speaker 1: Because if his life was limited...

1093
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,200
Speaker 0: There's lots of humans... Scott, there are lots of humans...

1094
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:45,319
Speaker 1: If he wasn't immortal, he would've, you know, whatever.

1095
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,459
Speaker 0: There are lots of humans who have no compunctions about killing their fellow humans.

1096
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,680
Speaker 1: Yes, that is true.

1097
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,599
Speaker 1: But at least we can threaten them.

1098
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,720
Speaker 1: They're afraid of dying themselves, I hope.

1099
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,278
Speaker 1: Unless they're really fucked up.

1100
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,740
Speaker 0: Anyway, at this point in the episode, I've had the equivalent of three drinks of alcohol.

1101
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,371
Speaker 1: I also...

1102
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,720
Speaker 0: I'm an empty stomach, to be fair.

1103
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,600
Speaker 1: There is a second aspect to the philosophy.

1104
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,260
Speaker 1: Which is, you know, the only way I have of seeing this universe that I believe is for real and not the Matrix.

1105
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:14,989
Speaker 1: And solipsism out the window.

1106
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:20,460
Speaker 0: A subjective, organic bag of bullshit that's mostly random.

1107
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,060
Speaker 1: I don't want to fuck up that bag any more than it's already fucked up.

1108
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,940
Speaker 1: Because then, who knows what kind of shit I'll...

1109
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,300
Speaker 0: But what if you can modify it in a controlled fashion to make it better?

1110
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:38,440
Speaker 0: What about that drug in the military that continues to be tested that theoretically could let us forego sleep for weeks at a time with no detrimental side effects?

1111
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,960
Speaker 1: It had to be super controlled, right?

1112
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,500
Speaker 1: It's like, if you take LSD, you don't know what the fuck you're gonna see, man.

1113
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you realize we were...

1114
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,758
Speaker 1: But if I could be like...

1115
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:51,080
Speaker 0: We as humans, Scott, were studying LSD and found that it could be very useful therapeutically in controlled environments.

1116
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:59,620
Speaker 1: It could be, but could I, for example, take an LSD and dictate beforehand, I'm gonna see dinosaurs and I'm gonna go and...

1117
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,839
Speaker 0: That's not quite how it works.

1118
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,417
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1119
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:10,920
Speaker 0: To express the sentiment that numerous people I know who have used LSD on one or more occasions have said, it takes your sort of core personality and amplifies it.

1120
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:25,400
Speaker 0: Everyone I've ever known who has taken LSD has basically said the same thing, that who you are becomes sort of unfiltered and the visions or the visualizations or whatever it is you see tend to be what's sort of deep down inside of you.

1121
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,580
Speaker 0: Like what you are without any veneer.

1122
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:32,760
Speaker 1: And that's why I'm saving that shit, you know, because obviously there's the counter philosophy, which is...

1123
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:38,800
Speaker 0: Because I will say right now, I am actually and have always been very interested in taking LSD and seeing what that would be like.

1124
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:45,700
Speaker 0: The only reason I have not is because I have never met anyone who I would trust to give me actual LSD.

1125
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,652
Speaker 1: There's a second philosophy, which is I have a short life, as we discussed.

1126
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,080
Speaker 1: I want to experience many things in it.

1127
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:54,900
Speaker 0: And that is one of the things you could experience.

1128
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,968
Speaker 1: So I am going to save those things until I am very old and almost dead.

1129
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:04,580
Speaker 1: That way I will not be, you know, possibly accidentally fucking up my body when I'm young.

1130
00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:14,039
Speaker 1: And three, of course, is that all drugs, right, even ones like weed, which, you know, aren't really going to hurt you at all, but, you know, you never know, right?

1131
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,054
Speaker 0: Well, Scott...

1132
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,319
Speaker 1: It is hot fire smoke in your lungs that damages you.

1133
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,640
Speaker 0: Well, one, if I were to smoke weed again, which may happen at PAX...

1134
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,639
Speaker 1: Probably use some other form.

1135
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:26,096
Speaker 0: I would probably use...

1136
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,020
Speaker 1: The brownie form, perhaps.

1137
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,600
Speaker 0: So brownie form is good, but that has a different kind of effect.

1138
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,499
Speaker 1: The vaporizer form.

1139
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,640
Speaker 0: The brownie form gives you a different kind of high because of the way it's metabolized.

1140
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,740
Speaker 1: There are also different varieties of weed that give you different kinds, I hear.

1141
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:47,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I would probably, I mean, depending on what is available, I would not be opposed to the traditional means because I'm not going to do it on a regular basis.

1142
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:58,800
Speaker 0: But in the long run, if I were to consume it at all, at any amount of regularity, I would probably use, at minimum, a water bong, most likely some sort of advanced vaporizer.

1143
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:00,578
Speaker 1: Yes, the vaporizer is key, but...

1144
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:07,059
Speaker 0: I am looking to invest, actually, personally, in the companies that make e-cigarettes because I think when marijuana is eventually widely legal...

1145
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:09,560
Speaker 1: E-cigarettes are getting popular.

1146
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,220
Speaker 0: I think e-cigarette marijuana delivery is going to cause a huge boom in that industry.

1147
00:59:15,482 --> 00:59:16,537
Speaker 1: I would be okay with that.

1148
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:17,231
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1149
00:59:18,003 --> 00:59:19,419
Speaker 1: But I wouldn't use it, but anyway...

1150
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,400
Speaker 0: Now, why wouldn't you if there are no demonstrable, physical, harmful side effects?

1151
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,414
Speaker 1: Because I have three philosophies, and that is only one of the three.

1152
00:59:27,454 --> 00:59:29,120
Speaker 1: You have to knock off all three.

1153
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,760
Speaker 1: So, obviously, the third one is I don't want to fuck myself up, so I'm not going to be doing cocaine and shit.

1154
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,900
Speaker 0: I have no plan to take cocaine or methamphetamine or heroin.

1155
00:59:41,063 --> 00:59:42,719
Speaker 1: Or, yeah, heroin, nope, not doing it.

1156
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's just an argument of degrees and extremes.

1157
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,097
Speaker 1: Opium, nope.

1158
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:52,600
Speaker 0: I mean, marijuana is probably less harmful and safer than alcohol or tobacco.

1159
00:59:52,902 --> 00:59:55,380
Speaker 1: Alcohol is actually probably worse than tobacco, even.

1160
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:01,680
Speaker 0: But at the same time, every study constantly seems to correlate that people who consume low and moderate amounts of alcohol over the course of their lives live longer.

1161
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,000
Speaker 1: But there's also tons of studies saying people who drink a lot of alcohol get cancer.

1162
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,411
Speaker 0: Or drink a lot of alcohol, yeah.

1163
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:07,380
Speaker 0: I don't drink a lot of alcohol.

1164
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,700
Speaker 1: You just drank three alcohols.

1165
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:10,138
Speaker 0: I'm working on four.

1166
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,771
Speaker 1: Okay, so I drug zero alcohols.

1167
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:14,460
Speaker 1: You're four closer to cancer than I am.

1168
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but according to...

1169
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,039
Speaker 1: Have fun with that cancer.

1170
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:18,660
Speaker 0: On average, I'm considered a light drinker.

1171
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:22,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, people are alcoholics.

1172
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,840
Speaker 1: I'll be doing that LSD, I guess, after you're dead.

1173
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:35,800
Speaker 0: But, Scott, what I'm saying is it is possible, you realize, to consume substances that alter your mind in a controlled fashion that does not make you addicted to them.

1174
01:00:36,121 --> 01:00:42,780
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm not worried about being addicted to them because I can't even get addicted to things that other people get addicted to, like video games and shit.

1175
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so would you consider attempting marijuana in a controlled fashion?

1176
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,609
Speaker 1: Because I can't control what it's going to do.

1177
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,919
Speaker 1: I can just control the amount, pretty much.

1178
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,150
Speaker 0: But, Scott, you'll take pseudoephedrine.

1179
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:55,820
Speaker 0: You can't 100% control what it'll do.

1180
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,220
Speaker 1: Which is why I do it as little as humanly possible.

1181
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,340
Speaker 0: But yet you do do it when you think the situation works.

1182
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,500
Speaker 1: And extremely rarely.

1183
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:03,099
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1184
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,720
Speaker 1: So what sickness do I have that I absolutely have this pressing need to do weed?

1185
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,559
Speaker 0: Being a curmudgeon?

1186
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:09,954
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I don't.

1187
01:01:09,974 --> 01:01:10,420
Speaker 1: I don't have any.

1188
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,480
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying, but it would be an interesting experience.

1189
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:17,320
Speaker 1: I'll save it for when I'm an old man after I've done all these other experiences.

1190
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:24,220
Speaker 0: So, Scott, what it is like, in my experience, which is somewhat limited, is that it basically just makes everything feel very chill.

1191
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:26,080
Speaker 1: Everything's already pretty chill.

1192
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,120
Speaker 0: So it'd feel a little bit chiller than it feels now.

1193
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,020
Speaker 1: It'd be more chill.

1194
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,798
Speaker 0: It'd be more chill.

1195
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:30,339
Speaker 1: Okay.

1196
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,959
Speaker 0: You're perfectly content to relax.

1197
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:32,818
Speaker 1: Don't need that.

1198
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,100
Speaker 0: And jokes, on average, are just funnier.

1199
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,740
Speaker 1: So you'll laugh at jokes that aren't actually funny.

1200
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:39,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1201
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,540
Speaker 1: So you'll be stupid.

1202
01:01:42,124 --> 01:01:43,340
Speaker 1: Why would I want to be stupid?

1203
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,320
Speaker 0: So is it that you're stupid or that you have a different perspective temporarily?

1204
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,560
Speaker 0: Because the thing is, it's reversible.

1205
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:48,499
Speaker 0: It goes away.

1206
01:01:48,863 --> 01:01:49,800
Speaker 1: Sure, it goes away.

1207
01:01:49,901 --> 01:01:52,580
Speaker 1: But why would I even want to make myself stupider even temporarily?

1208
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,780
Speaker 1: When I could just be smart all the time.

1209
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,640
Speaker 0: So is it stupider?

1210
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:00,299
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not talking about smoking so much weed that your eyes turn red.

1211
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:06,480
Speaker 1: So pretend no one in the room is smoking weed and I tell a stupid joke and it's a dumb joke objectively.

1212
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,680
Speaker 0: I'll probably laugh at it because I laugh at dumb jokes.

1213
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:11,340
Speaker 1: And I say, like, why did you cross the road to get the other side?

1214
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,919
Speaker 1: And a person honestly laughs.

1215
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:13,819
Speaker 1: Honestly.

1216
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:14,818
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1217
01:02:16,964 --> 01:02:18,399
Speaker 1: Is that person a dumb person?

1218
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,900
Speaker 0: Not necessarily, because I often laugh at dumb jokes and I make dumb jokes.

1219
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,060
Speaker 1: What will you think of that person if they are laughing?

1220
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,160
Speaker 0: I'll think that they're a candidate for puns at a later date.

1221
01:02:28,008 --> 01:02:28,240
Speaker 1: Right.

1222
01:02:28,421 --> 01:02:30,420
Speaker 1: So you're looking at that person differently.

1223
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,260
Speaker 1: You're judging that person in some way based on that laughter.

1224
01:02:34,701 --> 01:02:41,860
Speaker 0: So, Scott, you, when you are sick, laugh at dumb jokes and react very differently to things that you would react to when you're not sick.

1225
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,740
Speaker 0: If I could, I would also not alter my body with diseases.

1226
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,354
Speaker 0: Are you saying drugs are diseases?

1227
01:02:47,374 --> 01:02:47,899
Speaker 0: I agree.

1228
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,213
Speaker 0: No, I'm going to let you in on something.

1229
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:49,820
Speaker 0: It's a little secret.

1230
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,499
Speaker 0: Emily and I and many of the crew will agree.

1231
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:55,200
Speaker 0: When you are sick, it's kind of adorable.

1232
01:02:55,747 --> 01:02:55,958
Speaker 1: So?

1233
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,740
Speaker 0: The way you act and the way you speak is just ridiculously cute and adorable and funny.

1234
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,420
Speaker 1: I should do drugs for your entertainment and my detriment.

1235
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:06,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

1236
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,340
Speaker 0: No, I'm simply saying that I don't...

1237
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,387
Speaker 1: That's another philosophy I have.

1238
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:11,340
Speaker 1: Don't hurt myself for the benefit of others.

1239
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,300
Speaker 0: I would argue that the occasional use of marijuana...

1240
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:15,816
Speaker 1: I should do drugs as a charity?

1241
01:03:15,897 --> 01:03:16,119
Speaker 0: No.

1242
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:23,780
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying the occasional use of marijuana is probably less overall dangerous than biking in New York on a regular basis.

1243
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,979
Speaker 1: Maybe, but biking is way more fun.

1244
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,560
Speaker 0: But, Scott, part of the reason you enjoy it is because your body...

1245
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,139
Speaker 1: Biking is entertaining for me and not for you.

1246
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:35,640
Speaker 0: Your body is releasing substances that make you feel good because you exercised.

1247
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,351
Speaker 1: But I am getting those chemicals, honestly.

1248
01:03:38,412 --> 01:03:39,859
Speaker 1: I'm working for those chemicals.

1249
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:41,659
Speaker 0: You're getting those chemicals due to...

1250
01:03:42,062 --> 01:03:45,860
Speaker 1: By moving my legs and not by setting a plant on fire.

1251
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,334
Speaker 0: Beyond an arbitrary, 100% subjective line.

1252
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,479
Speaker 1: It is my line.

1253
01:03:51,741 --> 01:03:54,040
Speaker 0: I know it's your line, but I'm saying that line doesn't exist.

1254
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,480
Speaker 1: And it's not based on some falsehood, like an imaginary man.

1255
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:00,672
Speaker 0: No, it's not falsehood, but it is arbitrary.

1256
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:01,980
Speaker 0: You cannot say it's not arbitrary.

1257
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,908
Speaker 1: Everyone has arbitrary lines.

1258
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:06,340
Speaker 1: You have many arbitrary lines as well.

1259
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:06,882
Speaker 0: I do.

1260
01:04:06,902 --> 01:04:07,927
Speaker 0: I do.

1261
01:04:07,947 --> 01:04:10,340
Speaker 0: The word ginormous is a terrible word.

1262
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:12,120
Speaker 0: If you use it, you're a terrible person.

1263
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:18,220
Speaker 1: And as long as you do not apply or try to force your arbitrary lines on others, no one gives a shit, right?

1264
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,240
Speaker 1: Like, if that guy wants to be kosher, you know, charm.

1265
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:24,190
Speaker 1: Doesn't try to make me be kosher.

1266
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,960
Speaker 1: Doesn't come into my house and take my bacon.

1267
01:04:26,502 --> 01:04:28,300
Speaker 1: I'm not coming to your house taking your weed.

1268
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,433
Speaker 0: Well, of course he's not coming to your house and taking your bacon.

1269
01:04:30,453 --> 01:04:31,420
Speaker 0: He doesn't want to touch your bacon.

1270
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,022
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1271
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:35,220
Speaker 1: So, he doesn't try to make the government take him away with bacon either.

1272
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:35,878
Speaker 0: Well, some of them do.

1273
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,340
Speaker 1: Not in this country.

1274
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,097
Speaker 0: Not in this country, no.

1275
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:46,740
Speaker 1: If I don't want to smoke weed, as long as you don't try to force your weed on me, and I don't try to take your weed away from you, it's all good.

1276
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

1277
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:49,530
Speaker 1: And that just shows you how chill I am.

1278
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:51,020
Speaker 1: without weed, that I don't give a shit.

1279
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:52,480
Speaker 0: You'd be more chill, though.

1280
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:55,860
Speaker 1: I think I'm already at the plenty of chillness level.

1281
01:04:56,062 --> 01:04:57,400
Speaker 0: It would go up to 11.

1282
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,500
Speaker 1: More chillness would sort of go over the point to where it's, like, too much, and I would be danger zone.

1283
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:07,200
Speaker 0: Plus, I also consume caffeine on a regular basis as a performance enhancer.

1284
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:07,742
Speaker 1: I also avoid that.

1285
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:09,066
Speaker 1: I don't avoid it entirely.

1286
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:13,180
Speaker 1: I mean, it's in chocolate, it's in things, but I do not go after it.

1287
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,738
Speaker 1: I don't do, like, Altoids.

1288
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,779
Speaker 0: But it's got caffeine.

1289
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,632
Speaker 1: I don't do Penguin Mints.

1290
01:05:16,672 --> 01:05:17,180
Speaker 1: I don't do Red Bull.

1291
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,840
Speaker 0: Caffeine and coffee are both correlated with longer life.

1292
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:20,658
Speaker 0: Don't do coffee.

1293
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:22,559
Speaker 0: Pretty much almost all positive effects.

1294
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,979
Speaker 1: Let's see who will live longer.

1295
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:30,560
Speaker 0: I am confident that I'm going to outlive you unless I die in a skiing accident.

1296
01:05:32,746 --> 01:05:34,340
Speaker 1: I was hoping on the skiing accident.

1297
01:05:35,663 --> 01:05:40,980
Speaker 0: I think if I'm going to die before you, it is going to be due to some accident related to me in a sporting event.

1298
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:45,960
Speaker 1: Alright, I was going to say, let's make some sort of wager where whoever dies second has to do something embarrassing.

1299
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:48,578
Speaker 1: But instead, I have decided...

1300
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:52,640
Speaker 0: Wait, if I win, I don't want to have to do something embarrassing because you died.

1301
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,899
Speaker 1: I instead have decided, instead of making a bet, we shall make a pact.

1302
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,300
Speaker 1: And the pact shall be, we must die in a Jeffersonian, Adams-like fashion.

1303
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,339
Speaker 0: Alright, I get to be Adams.

1304
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,154
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter which one you are.

1305
01:06:07,174 --> 01:06:07,940
Speaker 1: That's the point.

1306
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:08,904
Speaker 0: You know what's funny?

1307
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:12,040
Speaker 0: One of my friends from high school, we had the same shtick.

1308
01:06:12,741 --> 01:06:17,400
Speaker 0: Where basically I was Jefferson, he was Adams, and we had the exact same pact that you brought up just now.

1309
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:18,319
Speaker 1: It's a through way.

1310
01:06:18,862 --> 01:06:20,933
Speaker 0: I think we've all seen 1776 too many times.

1311
01:06:22,682 --> 01:06:22,793
Speaker 1: Sure.

1312
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:25,640
Speaker 1: Are we done?

1313
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,219
Speaker 0: Scott still lives.

1314
01:06:29,382 --> 01:06:30,339
Speaker 1: Without drugs to help.

1315
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:44,700
Speaker 0: But seriously, Scott, caffeine, in the very least, what I will say is that while it's okay that you don't use caffeine, I respect that, but what it does for me, the feeling caffeine gives me, is that if I'm awake and I have caffeine, it doesn't do anything.

1316
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:47,500
Speaker 0: I enjoy coffee, but it doesn't do anything.

1317
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:54,160
Speaker 0: If I'm tired and I consume some caffeine, for an hour or two, I am no longer tired.

1318
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:57,329
Speaker 1: I have never tried it while tired.

1319
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:00,500
Speaker 1: I usually eat chocolate and things during the day.

1320
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,820
Speaker 0: If you consume caffeine when you are tired, it will make you not tired for an amount of time.

1321
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:14,340
Speaker 0: Now if you try to go too far, like say you're up two hours later, you were tired but you wanted to stay up for those last two hours of pacts on Saturday.

1322
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:22,000
Speaker 0: If you keep trying to take caffeine to go further, the effect is less and less and less and less and less.

1323
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:23,360
Speaker 0: So there's still a limit.

1324
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,500
Speaker 1: Right, but here, taking an example, my body on its own, remember at MAGFest?

1325
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,024
Speaker 1: We were open until like 5 a.m.

1326
01:07:29,084 --> 01:07:32,417
Speaker 1: and I felt super awake with no chemical help whatsoever.

1327
01:07:32,437 --> 01:07:33,320
Speaker 1: where you were Red Bulling.

1328
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:37,060
Speaker 0: I was Red Bulling partly because I'd stayed up later the previous night.

1329
01:07:37,321 --> 01:07:39,148
Speaker 1: I did as well, but I was up at 5 a.m.

1330
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:41,840
Speaker 1: and felt like I had just woken up and I was ready to rock and roll.

1331
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,357
Speaker 1: I was not tired in any way.

1332
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:45,440
Speaker 1: Without any chemical aid whatsoever.

1333
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't always Red Bull at night, but I'm saying the point at which you get tired...

1334
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,037
Speaker 1: You don't always Red Bull at night, but when you do...

1335
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,540
Speaker 0: When you do, Chase makes out with a furry.

1336
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,099
Speaker 1: That's right.

1337
01:07:56,521 --> 01:08:05,700
Speaker 0: But if you get to the point where you are tired and you consume a small amount of caffeine, you will magically not be tired for an extra hour or two.

1338
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:06,579
Speaker 1: You know what I do instead?

1339
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,791
Speaker 0: And then at the end of that time, you know what you'll do?

1340
01:08:08,115 --> 01:08:08,680
Speaker 0: You'll be tired.

1341
01:08:09,142 --> 01:08:10,567
Speaker 1: You know what I do when I am tired?

1342
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:14,200
Speaker 1: I sleep for 8 hours and then I wake up and I'm no longer tired.

1343
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:23,559
Speaker 0: So what about the situation, like at that dreaded Katsucon where we were sick and we did that late show which actually went okay, where you're tired... Yeah, you were also tired.

1344
01:08:24,206 --> 01:08:24,519
Speaker 0: I was sick.

1345
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:30,560
Speaker 0: You could have taken enough drugs and caffeine to not be tired and feel great for those two hours.

1346
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:30,962
Speaker 1: I did.

1347
01:08:31,002 --> 01:08:32,319
Speaker 1: I had orange juice and it worked great.

1348
01:08:33,661 --> 01:08:37,080
Speaker 0: I remember that moment where we shared the orange juice with our guest because he was also kind of sick.

1349
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:40,760
Speaker 0: We had our moment of commiserating over orange juice and the audience seemed to really dig in.

1350
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:42,698
Speaker 1: Why couldn't our late show at PAX be like that late show?

1351
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:49,859
Speaker 0: Because the standards at that venue were much lower than the standards at PAX.

1352
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one wasn't like, you know, it was better but it still wasn't that good.

1353
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,540
Speaker 0: But it was good enough for the venue and I think that's all I'll say about it.

1354
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,658
Speaker 1: It was better than the PAX one.

1355
01:08:58,925 --> 01:08:59,078
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1356
01:08:59,365 --> 01:08:59,560
Speaker 1: Alright.

1357
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,120
Speaker 0: It was partly because the first guest was chiller than our other first guest.

1358
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:03,606
Speaker 1: Yes.

1359
01:09:04,076 --> 01:09:04,260
Speaker 1: Alright.

1360
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:04,810
Speaker 1: Yeah?

1361
01:09:05,102 --> 01:09:05,738
Speaker 1: Are we done with the show?

1362
01:09:05,943 --> 01:09:06,799
Speaker 0: I think we're done with the show.

1363
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:07,343
Speaker 1: Okay.

1364
01:09:07,363 --> 01:09:08,319
Speaker 1: You liking the show to end?

1365
01:09:08,902 --> 01:09:10,600
Speaker 0: I like the show to end because I'm really freaking hungry.

1366
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,819
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1367
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,939
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1370
