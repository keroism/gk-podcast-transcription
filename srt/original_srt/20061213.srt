10
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:47,675
Speaker 2: What's?

11
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:48,417
Speaker 0: yes, that's me.

12
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:49,480
Speaker 0: Hey, how's it going guys?

13
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,569
Speaker 0: I guess I should establish my geek credentials to begin with.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,866
Speaker 0: I've been doing anime music videos since 1989 Which is right on.

15
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:10,071
Speaker 0: the birth of the entire movement Was a fan right about that period in time as well, so I'm firmly entrenched in the Voltron Transor Z Robotech stage of fandom.

16
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:18,829
Speaker 0: I Have because I've been doing it since 1989 It's what my college degree is in mass communication broadcasting.

17
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:32,811
Speaker 0: So and I've got like 10 years experience professionally editing for TV news stations and at the local affiliate level I'm still active in video production duplication these days.

18
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:41,360
Speaker 0: So as far as the technical aspects go I got it down And I've been doing this longer than I think most people have doing them these days.

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,620
Speaker 0: They've actually been alive, which is a frightening thing.

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:52,138
Speaker 0: I started saying I was old school when you were in kindergarten and I think with each passing year that becomes Sadly more and more true.

21
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:55,007
Speaker 2: Let's see, we were born.

22
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,780
Speaker 1: I was seven when you were making music videos.

23
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:59,647
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's right.

24
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,234
Speaker 2: Cuz we were born in 82, right?

25
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:01,555
Speaker 2: Yeah.

26
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:09,364
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm the other 16 years old.

27
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:17,837
Speaker 0: Wow, there are people 15 16 years old who are making videos now and consider anything from 2000 to be old school, which is painful.

28
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:21,408
Speaker 2: Wow Yeah, well at least we were both watching Voltron at the same time.

29
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:28,375
Speaker 2: I Didn't even know there was a vehicle team Voltron.

30
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:34,655
Speaker 0: until college I didn't know what the hell about with you vehicle team all the way could mainly because the Lead pilot was named Jeff.

31
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:38,525
Speaker 1: So that's See I had to admit it.

32
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:42,139
Speaker 1: I was more of a mask fan and I regret that to this day.

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, you saw oh don't regret that mask was good.

34
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:46,712
Speaker 1: Hey, I have all.

35
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:47,955
Speaker 1: I have all the toys.

36
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,540
Speaker 2: go try go try and watch mask.

37
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,605
Speaker 2: It's not good anymore.

38
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,395
Speaker 2: It's like go back and try to watch he-man.

39
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:54,223
Speaker 2: not good anymore It does.

40
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:55,406
Speaker 0: he was good to make fun of?

41
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:59,359
Speaker 2: I guess true, you know, but that's not the thing to brag about.

42
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, so anime music videos.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:13,240
Speaker 1: I mean we have often complained that we hate all current anime music videos and we like to think oh well back in the day It was good, but your back in the day is long before our back in the day.

44
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:25,870
Speaker 1: so I guess yes, we're not too up on exactly how the anime music video scene started or what it was like before YouTube and Computers that could just edit video on the fly and all that stuff.

45
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,330
Speaker 2: digital video cameras that were readily available in stores And of course Naruto.

46
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:30,612
Speaker 1: Yeah.

47
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:36,449
Speaker 0: and an internet capable of Distributing the videos or FTP or BitTorrent.

48
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:43,800
Speaker 1: the first AMV I ever downloaded was literally an AVI That was like a hundred by a hundred and fifty pixels to Sailor Moon.

49
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:47,352
Speaker 2: The first AMV I saw was at the first anime club.

50
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:47,974
Speaker 1: Really?

51
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:48,716
Speaker 1: Yeah Wow.

52
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:49,840
Speaker 2: I didn't even know they existed.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,844
Speaker 2: I was I was confused.

54
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:53,656
Speaker 2: I thought they were showing real music videos cuz they showed white reflection.

55
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:54,439
Speaker 2: They threw me all off.

56
00:03:56,642 --> 00:04:06,819
Speaker 0: The first AMV I saw was back in 1988 or 1989 the camera which and one of the first conventions I went to Called Dixie Trek in Atlanta, Georgia.

57
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:12,518
Speaker 0: It was done by a guy that I became fast friends with ever since.

58
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:13,280
Speaker 0: name is Matt Murray.

59
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:18,889
Speaker 0: He's with corn pone flex, which is a fan run Parody film site.

60
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:23,258
Speaker 0: they do a lot of live-action Fake trailers for movies that will never be made.

61
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:25,586
Speaker 0: They also made anime.

62
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:33,159
Speaker 0: one of the first anime parodies called star dip lots, which is sort of a retarded retelling of star blazers.

63
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:52,119
Speaker 0: Matt is good friends with Dave Merrill who a lot of fans will know is the man who gave birth to anime weekend Atlanta, which is now ironically one of the Largest if not the largest Convention that has anime music video programming in it.

64
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,188
Speaker 0: Matt had a room party.

65
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,978
Speaker 0: He was showing started watts and he also had some music videos.

66
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:58,360
Speaker 0: He's done.

67
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:02,605
Speaker 0: Try to remember the exact Things that he did.

68
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:03,990
Speaker 0: he had a couple of weird out videos.

69
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:07,435
Speaker 0: one was to Christmas at ground zero with a whole bunch of hot collective footage.

70
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:13,119
Speaker 0: the other one was slime creatures from outer space with you know, a lot of monsters.

71
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:31,874
Speaker 0: and The last one I remember seeing was the bird by The trash man, you know everybody, you know, the bird is the word that's not using footage of the Dory bird which is this sort of Black bird with a tiny little neck that sits on the shoulder of Captain

72
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:32,095
Speaker 2: Harlow.

73
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:33,018
Speaker 2: Oh, I know that bird.

74
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:35,439
Speaker 2: Yeah Now I know the name of it.

75
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,759
Speaker 1: We're slowly working our way through all that is Harlock and it is both joyous and horrible at the same time.

76
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,680
Speaker 0: So, I guess you've seen the dubs.

77
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:50,599
Speaker 2: Well, I mean one of the first anime I saw was galaxy three nine on sci-fi channel.

78
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:53,148
Speaker 0: So, oh, so is that?

79
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,079
Speaker 0: was that the new dub or the old that worries called Captain Warlock and he sounds like John Wayne.

80
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:00,132
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure it was Captain Harlock when I saw it.

81
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:01,659
Speaker 0: Oh, you were lucky.

82
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:03,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not that old.

83
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,756
Speaker 1: We never actually saw things like warriors of the wind.

84
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:09,746
Speaker 0: Yeah That is good that Scott.

85
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:18,935
Speaker 0: that's the subject of one of my best music videos really really yeah If anyone wants to check out my profile on anime music videos not of work.

86
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:28,672
Speaker 0: It's you can go to shrinkster comm CHI Charlie hotel indigo and video in question is called.

87
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,225
Speaker 0: I Think it's now sugar.

00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:32,169
Speaker 0: They reluctant warrior.

89
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,716
Speaker 0: It's set to Mike and the mechanics.

90
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:34,258
Speaker 0: Why me?

91
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,228
Speaker 0: It's a fairly long video.

92
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:50,027
Speaker 0: by today's standards, it's over five minutes long But back in the day my day which should be I guess around 1993 or 1992 You guys are familiar with New York City, of course.

93
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:54,260
Speaker 0: So have you ever heard of a convention called icon on Long Island?

94
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,925
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard of it, but I don't.

95
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:56,889
Speaker 2: I don't know much about it.

96
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,853
Speaker 2: People keep mentioning.

97
00:06:57,873 --> 00:07:23,879
Speaker 0: Yeah a good while back There was an icon that had a mini convention within it called chibi con And they had one of the first music video contests and they only had one prize which was best video of the year and the why me video took that prize and it still hold held as Favorite for a lot of people who've grown up with music videos for longer than the mid 90s.

98
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:29,880
Speaker 0: Trying to get back to I'll give him back to where I started with talking with Matt Murray.

99
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,729
Speaker 0: I saw his stuff really liked.

100
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:47,108
Speaker 0: it came close friends with him because his stuff was tight it matched the beat it went on the lyrics and This is still when he's just using two consumer grade VCRs to edit this thing, you know, you have the tape pause Press record.

101
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,054
Speaker 0: Oh wait, it didn't work.

102
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:48,598
Speaker 0: There's a rainbow.

103
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,645
Speaker 0: Recue both the tapes.

104
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,773
Speaker 0: try it again on pause.

105
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:53,818
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a flash ring.

106
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:54,300
Speaker 0: Can't use that?

107
00:07:54,741 --> 00:08:02,891
Speaker 0: So if you imagine doing that process trial and error over and over again without trying to bust your VCR Turn out something that looked as good as what he had.

108
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:15,247
Speaker 0: It really inspired me and Got back home started college that that same year where they had a JVC Professional grade VHS editing deck.

109
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:16,712
Speaker 0: It's just two decks.

110
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:21,828
Speaker 0: They could do assemble at it and Video insert and two tracks of audio insert.

111
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,533
Speaker 0: and that's all it was.

112
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:30,028
Speaker 0: and I had my first music video Done within a couple of months after I started college.

113
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:34,039
Speaker 0: It took like two days to edit and that was on my profile.

114
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:38,400
Speaker 0: It's the one that is the Akira music video set to twisted sisters.

115
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,400
Speaker 0: The kids are back and I recently remastered it with DVD footage, which is amazing.

116
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:54,577
Speaker 0: It's like it's so easy to do it on the computer at home without having to you know Sneak into the TV studio at the university and make sure no one's using it for something.

117
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:55,500
Speaker 0: It's actually worthwhile.

118
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:05,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, that really seems to be kind of the biggest I guess complaint or anything about people who talk about AMVs that as it's gotten Easier to make them there have been more of them

119
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:18,088
Speaker 0: There have been more people doing them there are considerably more videos and there are considerably more people who should have no music videos Because it is so easy.

120
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:25,220
Speaker 0: I mean with great power it comes great responsibility And I don't think a lot of people understand that they stay to see is the new hot thing.

121
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,283
Speaker 0: They see a lot of people doing it.

122
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:29,695
Speaker 0: They wander past a contest going on a convention.

123
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,849
Speaker 0: seeing that seeing all these people Laughing and cheering at what they're seeing on screen.

124
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:36,460
Speaker 0: They think hey, there's a little thing on my computer.

125
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,906
Speaker 0: It's called Windows Movie Maker.

126
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,432
Speaker 0: I wonder if I can do something with that.

127
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:47,025
Speaker 0: So they'll download and hover however many crappy encodes they can get off Kazaa or Lime wire or whatever.

128
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,051
Speaker 0: and it's got like it's all chunky.

129
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:53,680
Speaker 0: It's probably in real media format and It just looks terrible anything.

130
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:58,119
Speaker 0: Hey, I can just take any music I want and slam three minutes worth of stuff on top of it.

131
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,879
Speaker 0: And hey, I got a music video and it couldn't be more wrong in my estimation.

132
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,880
Speaker 1: Well, then kind of a two-part question here.

133
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,570
Speaker 1: But what would you think was kind of the Golden Age?

134
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,980
Speaker 1: or when did the best AMVs overall come out?

135
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,840
Speaker 1: And I guess in pursuant to that what makes an AMV good in your opinion?

136
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,827
Speaker 1: Like what is it that makes one click versus one?

137
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:16,510
Speaker 1: that just doesn't.

138
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:28,984
Speaker 0: I would say the Golden Age is any time between Just more or less arbitrarily between 1989 and 1993 or 1994 because that is the point where it would.

139
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:32,904
Speaker 0: if you wanted to make an AMV music video you were stuck with videotape and only Videotape.

140
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:53,639
Speaker 0: and if you had the patience to sit there Whether it in a university setting with a professional deck or at home with two VCRs to high-five forehead flying a race VCRs Then you probably wanted to do it in some professional capacity or else You're just really obsessive and willing to take the time to do it.

141
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:55,327
Speaker 0: And I think as a result there was.

142
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,151
Speaker 0: there was some crap.

143
00:10:56,171 --> 00:11:01,911
Speaker 0: sure there were some crappy videos back then But by and large the community was much smaller.

144
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:18,480
Speaker 0: It was made of more dedicated people and Fandom was still small enough that I think It got more appreciation just by the number of people that were around I. They didn't get lost in the shuffle of the big conventions of today.

145
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:21,678
Speaker 0: They didn't get lost in the shuffle of everyone else's music video.

146
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:25,860
Speaker 0: There weren't contests in the first few years that I started doing them.

147
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:34,597
Speaker 0: It was simply something that you might show a couple at opening ceremonies or you might try to sneak one in during some dead space between stuff that was shown in the video room.

148
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,584
Speaker 0: it wasn't really something meant to be made as a Competitive video.

149
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,900
Speaker 0: it was something you did for fun that you just want to say hey take a look what I did.

150
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,031
Speaker 0: This is pretty good for anything.

151
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:57,027
Speaker 0: Yeah My first music video premiered at a Christmas party with maybe You know five or ten people and had no aspirations of trying to get into our contest Just to see if I can win something.

152
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,455
Speaker 0: It was just like I did this.

153
00:11:58,556 --> 00:11:59,119
Speaker 0: It looks pretty cool.

154
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,236
Speaker 0: Tell me what you think.

155
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:08,720
Speaker 1: Yeah definitely compare that to today where Every con has the AMV contest just like they have the cosplay and people go from con to con and it's this huge deal.

156
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,695
Speaker 1: You know who won what where and I've won this many awards.

157
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:15,860
Speaker 0: therefore blah And therefore I'm excellent, you know, maybe not.

158
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,568
Speaker 0: What was the second part of your question?

159
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:20,352
Speaker 0: again, what makes it?

160
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:22,120
Speaker 0: what do I think makes a good music video?

161
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess tell some of our listeners the videos you think.

162
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:33,667
Speaker 1: like a couple of them three or four Maybe that are really really good and what you like or at least what would make a video that good to where you'd remember it And it wouldn't get lost in the shuffle.

163
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:49,293
Speaker 0: Yeah right now something my very favorites I have to go with failed experiments in video editing by EK Simply because she's a really good artist and Took some of her actual failed attempts at trying to make a music video They like.

164
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:55,720
Speaker 0: yet She had a good concept but couldn't really get into the editing past the first part or had a really good song.

165
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,606
Speaker 0: But the editing didn't really work.

166
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:02,420
Speaker 0: and then she linked all these together with cartoons that she had done about the process.

167
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:04,511
Speaker 0: editing on premiere.

168
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:10,540
Speaker 0: and you know the the edit edit edit beer edit edit beer and Render.

169
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:14,994
Speaker 0: That one's is really good because it's genuinely funny.

170
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:30,328
Speaker 0: It's well paced and the effort shows another one of your shameless rock video by Absolute destiny which uses footage from foodie foodie flcl And a cut down song.

171
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,459
Speaker 0: I can't remember the name of the song now, but it's a really good song.

172
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:37,676
Speaker 0: A lot of good digital effects in there that don't overwhelm the video.

173
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:38,780
Speaker 0: They fit in very nicely.

174
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:40,713
Speaker 0: It's very tightly edited.

175
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:47,809
Speaker 0: It's It's just a beautiful thing to behold Tainted donuts, which is one of the first videos.

176
00:13:47,849 --> 00:14:08,469
Speaker 0: I think that really took compositing to a new level taking two dissimilar titles try gun and cowboy bebop and managing to stick a character from one into a scene with the others like spike and jet are looking at It's Vash the stampede and it looks pretty good.

177
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:13,068
Speaker 0: I think that one set a new standard that everyone tried to eight from then on out.

178
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:18,190
Speaker 1: it did I remember right at like right before it came out or at least right before everyone started to be aware of it.

179
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,007
Speaker 1: I remember seeing a similar video someone tried to do to the same two anime and it was.

180
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,969
Speaker 1: I Won't mention who did if it was god-awful.

181
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:39,856
Speaker 2: I don't think I remember who did it but I do remember a time when everyone you know had the idea That you could make a music video where you combine different shows together But no one had actually been able to do it technologically speaking Until wasn't aside.

182
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,501
Speaker 0: as an aside one thing.

183
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:50,970
Speaker 0: one other thing that I did in addition to music videos is I was Among the pioneers of fan parody films along with Matt Murray CP Smith and the rest of guys with corn bone flicks.

184
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:53,488
Speaker 0: I did animation versus live-action.

185
00:14:54,252 --> 00:14:59,090
Speaker 0: Granted it was cutting back and forth between the two sources, but it was without any kind of real compositing.

186
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:16,384
Speaker 0: But it was my homage to the great flame Wars that happened on BBS systems across the country in the early days of using that who'd win in the fight the Space battleship Yamato versus a Star Destroyer Captain Harlock versus the Enterprise who would win?

187
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:19,933
Speaker 0: and my films X23 and x20.

188
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:29,582
Speaker 0: now the full titles super hyper mega bloody ultra cosmo death extravaganza x23 And it's its sequel x23 to electric boogaloo.

189
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:38,068
Speaker 0: just the co-production with Matt Murray Ended up being two and a half hours long, but man we told so many jokes in there was impossible It literally impossible to edit it down.

190
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:43,309
Speaker 0: Yes, so yeah, I look at the but so that was.

191
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:48,950
Speaker 0: you know I was able to cut back and forth between animation and live-action sources there and still able to tell a good story.

192
00:15:49,952 --> 00:16:02,402
Speaker 0: but then along comes tainted donuts and Maybe there's one or two things ahead of that, but everyone remembers tainted donuts where it's composited very nicely and people hold that as a Good standard.

193
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:08,630
Speaker 0: One of what else do I think makes a good music video being able to appreciate?

194
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:12,070
Speaker 0: Your source material both your audio and your video.

195
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,810
Speaker 0: Take a song that Has lyrics that you can match a video to being able to edit on the beat.

196
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:24,189
Speaker 0: There's a video that got a lot of hype on the west coast.

197
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:36,870
Speaker 0: It was footage from X or one set to Metallica's enter Sandman and Mostly real listeners and you guys have probably heard the song where there's that there's a guitar solo.

198
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:47,222
Speaker 0: And then right in the middle of a James Hetfield cells boom and in that music video the editor Completely failed to put anything at that very natural sync point.

199
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:48,807
Speaker 0: and that bothered me everyone.

200
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:52,280
Speaker 0: and it bothered me more That people thought this was a fantastic video.

201
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:53,767
Speaker 0: and here I am pointing out.

202
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:54,349
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no.

203
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:58,289
Speaker 0: look He missed this very crucial point did actually nothing with it.

204
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,290
Speaker 0: So that's something I look for as well.

205
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:06,829
Speaker 2: I do have to agree that when videos don't match up like with the beats that gets on my nerves more than anything.

206
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:16,329
Speaker 1: Actually, what bothers me even more than that is when they try when they match up the lyrics to what's going on to the video in a direct non metaphoric stupid way.

207
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:22,152
Speaker 2: Yeah, well sometimes they do it in a way that really takes you out of the video and they go and you're like wow That's dumb.

208
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,661
Speaker 2: But sometimes they do it in a way that's you know, it's alright.

209
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking about like.

210
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:26,930
Speaker 1: they said the word hand.

211
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,516
Speaker 1: Oh, but here's a picture of someone holding their hand up.

212
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:30,001
Speaker 1: Oh, they said the word TV.

213
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:30,764
Speaker 1: Look there's a TV.

214
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:31,567
Speaker 1: I'll candidate.

215
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:40,910
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it works if the little stuff like that works if it flows If the stuff they're showing ends up flowing together.

216
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,401
Speaker 0: They're showing random shots like ooh TV ooh hand ooh face ooh eyes.

217
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,905
Speaker 0: then no not so much.

218
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:53,910
Speaker 0: I mean they're showing some technical Acumen by doing that but they haven't polished it.

219
00:17:54,071 --> 00:18:01,010
Speaker 0: I think that's a complaint that I have a lot about a lot of Music videos these days and their editors is that they've got the technical expertise.

220
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:13,165
Speaker 0: They've moved beyond just a basic say a basic Lincoln ball video which for some of your listeners who don't know Fusion You're sleep.

221
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:22,125
Speaker 0: I Lincoln Park set to Random fight footage from Dragon Ball Z and there are literally thousands about.

222
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,729
Speaker 2: why there are thousands of those.

223
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:31,945
Speaker 2: Didn't the 999th guy say hey, there are 998 of these.

224
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,470
Speaker 2: maybe I should make something else.

225
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:38,329
Speaker 1: No, he thought I'm gonna make it so much better than all of those fools who don't understand Goku's true pain.

226
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:41,817
Speaker 0: Perhaps They're probably both thinking also.

227
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:42,742
Speaker 0: I want to be number 1,000.

228
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,129
Speaker 0: That'll mean something.

229
00:18:44,930 --> 00:19:02,230
Speaker 1: Actually at RIT anime for April Fool's showing we because we always showed a bunch of anime music videos before the show or before The you know the showing every week Which honestly as the years went on got harder and harder because we just couldn't find New good ones that hadn't already been shown in past years and they were probably out there.

230
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:02,889
Speaker 1: We couldn't find them.

231
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:08,767
Speaker 1: But what we did is we showed I think five or six videos and they were all to Dragon Ball Z Linkin Park in the end.

232
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:19,486
Speaker 1: And then to top it off we bring out the last video and I promise you guys this isn't to Dragon Ball Z and then Linkin Park in the end starts.

233
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:23,989
Speaker 0: It was like Gundam wing And then you woke up in the hospital.

234
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,169
Speaker 2: No, you would be surprised how?

235
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:29,739
Speaker 2: Not angry.

236
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,426
Speaker 2: the club was.

237
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:35,426
Speaker 1: yeah I mean 150 200 people in the room and they'll pretty much sit there until the lights come on.

238
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,450
Speaker 1: then they'll kill you.

239
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,428
Speaker 1: Stay until the lights come on.

240
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:52,926
Speaker 2: So before you mentioned that the Golden Age was like way in like the early 90s But a lot of videos you mentioned as your favorites came way later.

241
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,215
Speaker 2: So Yeah

242
00:19:55,871 --> 00:20:15,707
Speaker 0: Mostly because that's the ones that I mentioned are ones that actually be downloaded these days Some of the ones that I remember as being really good in the Golden Age stuff done by Matt Murray by the Seiko beaver Derek Jackson goes by the name Jenga row and there are others that I can't but I can't remember

243
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:16,189
Speaker 1: off the bat.

244
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,136
Speaker 0: They simply aren't available for download.

245
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:23,510
Speaker 0: They exist maybe on VHS and the corner of someone's closet and that's about it.

246
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,598
Speaker 2: Why they were never uploaded and why doesn't someone do that?

247
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:31,070
Speaker 2: Is it just laziness forgetfulness not caring or not knowing?

248
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,668
Speaker 0: Not not knowing be the main thing.

249
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:35,897
Speaker 0: They're animated music videos.

250
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,463
Speaker 0: org does to have a proxy service.

251
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:41,135
Speaker 0: some stuff has been at least Documented if not uploaded.

252
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:45,169
Speaker 0: In fact, I've probably got a lot of Matt's music videos hanging around here.

253
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:53,710
Speaker 0: He's at the point in his life where he doesn't really care much about Anime anymore and he cares even less about what fandom has become.

254
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:56,580
Speaker 0: So he doesn't care about his music videos anymore.

255
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:02,170
Speaker 0: So I might have to take him up and Upload them to the org as a proxy because this stuff needs to be shown.

256
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:09,790
Speaker 1: I would say in addition to that How would what if say you got together a panel at a con or a showing room at a con and it was the old?

257
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,537
Speaker 1: School anime music videos.

258
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:19,045
Speaker 1: There's no way you could have ever seen before thing unless you're real Or actually did them.

259
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:25,529
Speaker 0: Respect your elders just because I don't think that it.

260
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:35,830
Speaker 0: In a way it's a handicap because You know The Internet is the monster that it is now and anything before then has been left and by the wayside it clearly forgotten.

261
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:36,649
Speaker 1: See, I don't know.

262
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:50,146
Speaker 1: I do see a lot of people on the internet now who if they find out there's something out there That they could have seen that isn't on the internet like an anime that no one ever even Got from TV onto a digital medium a lot of them will.

263
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:57,472
Speaker 1: they have this collector Compulsion and they'll freak out and do anything they can to get it and watch it and distribute it just to say that they could Any.

264
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:57,934
Speaker 2: just today?

265
00:21:57,954 --> 00:22:02,790
Speaker 2: I saw a website full of 80s commercials all on YouTube and it was the most fantastic thing ever.

266
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,809
Speaker 0: Throw some most into the mix and anime hell.

267
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,833
Speaker 0: That's perfect.

268
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:13,184
Speaker 0: I I think that and I'm gonna be mean here.

269
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:37,426
Speaker 0: So I'm speaking in I. I Think that the anime music videos community is split into The hopeless consumers and the hapless creators people who are too busy making their next world beating anime music video that may or may not be that great and the people who Exist to do nothing but consume it.

270
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:50,250
Speaker 0: And then you've got the subset of on both sides the the people who come on to the anime music videos Forums and For all intents and purposes Blair through a megaphone.

271
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,610
Speaker 0: How do I download these videos?

272
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:02,298
Speaker 0: How do I watch them despite the fact that there are stickies right above their heads on the forums that say hey How do I download this?

273
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,890
Speaker 0: or how do I get a single player?

274
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:21,746
Speaker 0: So the people who say the people who have obviously by the little date next to their name have registered that very day and Probably haven't done any kind of lurking or looking around on the forums or the main site that has all sorts of informative guides and post.

275
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:27,485
Speaker 0: How do I make a music video despite the fact again that there's a sticky above their heads.

276
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:28,789
Speaker 0: It says how do I do this?

277
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:32,665
Speaker 0: More often than not they're gonna get flamed to hell and back.

278
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:41,682
Speaker 0: Some people are Helpful and try to help but I think these people are pretty hopeless to be in with And maybe maybe this is a role I can fill.

279
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:44,312
Speaker 0: there really needs to be Someone.

280
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,625
Speaker 0: who's the combination of American idols?

281
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:47,610
Speaker 0: Simon Cowell?

282
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,836
Speaker 2: We don't know about that.

283
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:53,329
Speaker 1: I know I'm not totally divorced from pop culture unlike you Scott, right?

284
00:23:54,471 --> 00:24:02,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's the really caustic British judge who if someone sucks will come straight out and say you suck and you should never sing ever ever again.

285
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:07,610
Speaker 0: Simon Cowell crossed with Al Square engine from Deadwood.

286
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:16,350
Speaker 0: I Someone who's not again not afraid to tell someone that they suck and probably stick a knife in the back at the same time.

287
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:18,430
Speaker 1: See to us you're preaching to the choir.

288
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:26,690
Speaker 1: we've always wanted a site kind of the way OC remixes is for AMVs where They look at him and they only put up the ones that they think are good like kind of a filter.

289
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:32,390
Speaker 1: Because I mean, I guess I'll ask you this question, but the technology is better now It's so much easier to make music videos.

290
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,070
Speaker 1: So you'd think that the people who are good could be making just even more amazing videos.

291
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,584
Speaker 1: So are people making amazing videos and we just can't find them in the chaff?

292
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,570
Speaker 1: or did the good people just disappear?

293
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:52,650
Speaker 0: Some of the good people disappeared some of the other good people do nothing But work all year on the music video the single music video that they're gonna put into the contest at AWA.

294
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:55,529
Speaker 0: I think those are the big things.

295
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:01,730
Speaker 0: There's no one person who's turning out several good music videos a year or even several people doing that.

296
00:25:02,113 --> 00:25:02,396
Speaker 0: I think it.

297
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:23,081
Speaker 0: I think it really falls into The people who just churn out garbage and have all this amazing Technology at their disposal and and just throw stuff up randomly because hey, it looks good you know doesn't really fit and as I said the people who are in fact really really good and Really are just working on their next killer

298
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,227
Speaker 1: app no matter how long

299
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:24,589
Speaker 2: it takes.

300
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:30,630
Speaker 2: I mean the technology though must enable the people who are really really good to make, you know more better videos.

301
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,970
Speaker 2: I mean if they made you know ten good videos with the old tech you can't make ten good.

302
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,290
Speaker 2: They should be able to make you know, twenty even better videos with the new technology.

303
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,764
Speaker 2: So while you know, you've added, you know, this giant mountain of crap.

304
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:57,490
Speaker 2: There must be you know, the Total sum of good stuff must have increased or as it not Yeah, the good stuff has increased but the crappy stuff has increased exponentially more.

305
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:03,690
Speaker 0: There's just a lot of stuff out there that should never have been made or at least never released to the public.

306
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:10,893
Speaker 0: It's it's one thing to make a music video just to practice and see if you're any good at it and show to your friends And they say hey, that's really good.

307
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:11,455
Speaker 0: That's really good.

308
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:21,250
Speaker 0: And then they release it to the org and it is lost amongst Hundreds of literally hundreds of other videos that are almost just like it.

309
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:24,657
Speaker 1: Well, I get but I've got.

310
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:34,156
Speaker 1: I've got kind of two ideas that I've been bad around for a long time as to Why it's so hard for the good videos to get Distributed versus the crowd.

311
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:35,361
Speaker 2: I know what your two ideas are.

312
00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:37,390
Speaker 2: Yeah, because we pretty much agree with third idea.

313
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:40,170
Speaker 1: All right, but just we'd like to hear your thoughts on this one.

314
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:51,845
Speaker 1: It seems like most cons now will show any video you send them and they'll have a room where they'll just show Anime music videos and anime music videos and anime music videos and anime music videos forever.

315
00:26:51,965 --> 00:27:04,650
Speaker 1: or even if it's not all dedicated room They'll still have you know, two hours worth of a MVs to show even if there were only 40 minutes worth of Not not saying great music videos but videos that are above the line of being being worth showing.

316
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:10,686
Speaker 1: Like it seems like they feel so bad about telling someone they're not going to show something that they show everything.

317
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:18,508
Speaker 1: and right along with that Most cons now have rules that if your video is already won an award anywhere They don't want you to enter it.

318
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:26,450
Speaker 1: so it seems like once a video succeeds it immediately disappears and Then people at Otacon never see it because it already won an award at AWA.

319
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:29,486
Speaker 1: And I guess Scott's got a third thing.

320
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:29,910
Speaker 0: I think you're right?

321
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:41,830
Speaker 2: Yeah, well my thing is, you know I remember his time back at RIT that some guy Was watching an AMV on his laptop that his friend was in the process of making and it was a really good macross video.

322
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,008
Speaker 2: But you know, I was like, hey, can you can you send me that?

323
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:45,370
Speaker 2: or you know?

324
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:59,859
Speaker 2: when is that, you know, because I wanted to see it because it was really good and The attitude of the guy who was making it and the guy who was showing it to me were both, you know Like no, we're gonna show it once at a convention and we're never gonna put it on the internet or anything because we're all you know assholes.

325
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:13,927
Speaker 2: so And I remember looking for anime music videos to show at anime club and I often found that you know Not everything was out on the internet to download even stuff that was you know already out.

326
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:18,620
Speaker 1: and yeah I mean not stuff like oh It's an awesome video from the early 90s.

327
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,570
Speaker 1: that's on a VHS tape and no one bothered to put it up But people who have the digital format and specifically refuse to distribute it.

328
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,723
Speaker 1: Yeah

329
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:39,216
Speaker 2: I mean I get the feeling that The part of the reason why the good stuff doesn't come out is because the people who put so much time are less willing to Freely distribute them while the people who whipped up some crap, you know, Lincoln Ball in five minutes They want all their friends to see it.

330
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:41,989
Speaker 2: So they put it up on BitTorrent and everything for everyone in the whole world.

331
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:47,070
Speaker 0: I guess I haven't really run into many too many people who feel so possessive of their work.

332
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:53,070
Speaker 0: They want to keep it to themselves and make love to it and that might really be a northern thing.

333
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:59,450
Speaker 1: It might be cuz Daryl and Gerald is also to a degree said that they don't see that so much and we've seen it a lot.

334
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:09,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm totally going on anecdotal evidence here, which is why I'm asking Yeah, cuz to to your to your credit the guy we're talking about at anime club was kind of a scary fanboy in and of himself indeed.

335
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:27,133
Speaker 0: But Yeah, going back to one of your other points About how there are rules that say if your anime music video has already won an award you can't enter it in this contest and I agree that I think a lot of good stuff doesn't get shown because People are.

336
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:39,169
Speaker 0: some people are just simply chasing the next contest and probably aren't willing to send their stuff to a general As willing to send something to a general showing and I agree that you know.

337
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:45,827
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's it comes down to the stuff that makes the cut and the rest that could get shown in a general showing.

338
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:59,149
Speaker 0: and I think that's where you see a lot of junk Going to think now Yeah, that yeah that pretty much covers it as far as I can tell unless I think of something else.

339
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:08,910
Speaker 2: What would you think if there was a convention that wouldn't show a music video unless it had already won something in the previous year?

340
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:11,074
Speaker 0: I would probably go for that.

341
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:18,904
Speaker 0: I think it would probably bring a lot of good competition into it sort of a you know a royal rumble of enemies music videos.

342
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:35,585
Speaker 0: not to steal a thunder of Iron editor which is doing a royal rumble type thing at Ohio con which I just found out I'm a part of Yeah, but I'd like to see that sort of like, you know the best of the best and maybe hold it at AWA as opposed to simply the AWA contest.

343
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:57,210
Speaker 0: have like gather all or We probably wouldn't be able to do all because there's so many conventions now, but a relative sampling of maybe the winning music videos from what I guess what you consider be the major conventions Otacon and Anime Expo and Akon and Anime Central AWA, etc, etc, and then pit those against each other?

344
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, that'd be a good idea.

345
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:14,276
Speaker 1: I'm just for anything that'll make it easy for people to see good videos and recognize that They're good videos because then maybe people will I don't know either not make crap videos or at least the crap videos will kind of Exist, but they'll be static.

346
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:17,890
Speaker 1: They won't be out on the forefront like they are now because it's so hard to find good.

347
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,403
Speaker 1: And these I've seen maybe two that were new that I've liked in the past.

348
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:23,346
Speaker 1: what seven years.

349
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:33,590
Speaker 2: Yeah How do you find new good music videos short of going to all the conventions and looking at the winners?

350
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:36,610
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, I've been to enemy music videos at org not recently.

351
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,609
Speaker 2: I'm sure you use that site a lot more than I do.

352
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:42,070
Speaker 0: But well, I usually when it's like an I can stand to use it.

353
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,359
Speaker 0: Sometimes it just becomes a cesspool and I have to step away from.

354
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,067
Speaker 2: it's exactly what I'm trying to get at.

355
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:56,267
Speaker 2: is when I used It you know in years past it was always very very difficult to search and there was no way to say Show me the most popular video right now, you know, give it to me.

356
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:56,850
Speaker 2: Show me something.

357
00:31:57,031 --> 00:32:03,152
Speaker 1: I can honestly say that whenever I went to an V's org and I was looking for music a specific music video It was great.

358
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:09,523
Speaker 1: But if I was just browsing by song or by anime or by whatever I don't think I ever found anything by accident.

359
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:10,790
Speaker 1: That wasn't horrible.

360
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,075
Speaker 0: That's that's the sad thing.

361
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:21,376
Speaker 0: we're using the quick search or using the super powerful super Nice.

362
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,310
Speaker 1: I was searching because I was looking for stuff to show to clubs.

363
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:30,266
Speaker 1: I remember I would search like very specifically like I want this anime without Spoilers and I'd pick like different genres of music.

364
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:38,029
Speaker 1: I'd poke around Just looking for something we always had to pick like something high-energy something slow something sappy maybe something funny.

365
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:58,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I'm looking at the main page for the org right now and on the right hand side There's the top list the top 10% videos the top star scale the top favorite videos the most commented videos The most used anime the most used music most underrated which I'm not sure how they figure that out.

366
00:32:58,671 --> 00:32:59,856
Speaker 0: Maybe it's the one that's got the.

367
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,749
Speaker 2: maybe it's well, you're the simple watch but no one votes on or anything.

368
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:04,435
Speaker 0: I know that's exactly right here.

369
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:08,030
Speaker 0: here are the 50 most downloaded videos with the fewest opinions left for them.

370
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,710
Speaker 0: No, I would suggest giving that another shot if you haven't been there in a while.

371
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:18,990
Speaker 1: It has been four years since I went to anime music videos org on purpose.

372
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:30,326
Speaker 2: Well, I went to it to look at your profile and that way Smart man Alright.

373
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:34,067
Speaker 2: so why don't we talk about Like the process of making a music video?

374
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:40,888
Speaker 1: because without technical detail technical details that will put everyone to sleep Just like what I guess to break it down.

375
00:33:40,928 --> 00:33:43,920
Speaker 1: What's what's the core things you need to do to make a music video?

376
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,256
Speaker 1: That isn't just utter ass.

377
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:50,690
Speaker 0: Well, I try to just go through the process in which I do it.

378
00:33:51,673 --> 00:34:03,144
Speaker 0: I'll usually hear a song that I really like and Think that hey this might go with a particular anime that I've got or I can get a hold of And then just start.

379
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:08,340
Speaker 0: my process is probably different than other people, but I start story about storyboarding it out in my head.

380
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:16,154
Speaker 0: I'll take specific lyrics and then think that this particular scene from episode three would work really well here.

381
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:21,165
Speaker 0: and Well see Nowadays I'll just open a premiere.

382
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:22,710
Speaker 0: have the timeline.

383
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,034
Speaker 0: sting that right in front of you blank.

384
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:25,399
Speaker 0: lay the music down.

385
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:43,766
Speaker 0: Get all of my footage converted from DVD to a format that is easier to edit with and then just starts plunking down scenes in Maybe about two second increments or so until I've and then just Preview it and play it.

386
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:46,940
Speaker 0: preview and play and then fix it and then preview it and play it again.

387
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:52,080
Speaker 0: And that's why nonlinear editing on the computer is so much more fun than doing it on videotape.

388
00:34:54,042 --> 00:35:02,739
Speaker 0: And then just and I don't consider putting effects in until I get everything More or less laid down unless I know specifically I want to have a dissolve.

389
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:04,043
Speaker 0: here I want to go from.

390
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:16,340
Speaker 0: I want to transition nice and slow from this two shot of The two students in love to a close-up of the guy and then dissolve again to the close-up of the girl.

391
00:35:17,522 --> 00:35:41,645
Speaker 0: If I don't have anything like this specifically in mind, and I'll just lay everything down cut to cut to cut and once you get all that laid down if I can make my yardstick is if I can get the whole thing finished and rendered and Play it out if I can sit there, and I'm smiling by the end just by like Thinking that yeah that that went really well together, then I know it's a pretty decent video But you gotta have the.

392
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:43,052
Speaker 0: I'll just go back to it.

393
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:44,740
Speaker 0: You gotta have respect for your sources.

394
00:35:45,122 --> 00:36:03,739
Speaker 0: You got to know what it is you're editing with what video it is And that's why it's so dangerous to tackle big TV series sometimes that unless you've watched it several times I know it inside and out then You're gonna be strapped for footage And then you start grabbing random stuff and throwing it in just to fill this little one second told you got.

395
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:06,640
Speaker 1: Well, I actually never thought of that.

396
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:17,614
Speaker 1: But it makes sense because I think a half the videos I see at cons now And they only cover like the first nine episodes of a show because someone seemed like they wanted to Get the video out as soon as the show finished, and they didn't actually pay attention.

397
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:22,050
Speaker 2: I've also noticed a lot more Various videos whereas back in the day.

398
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,739
Speaker 2: There were usually a lot more single show videos.

399
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:33,527
Speaker 0: I think that for me anyway, that's that speaks to the shortening attention span of people these days.

400
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 0: one of the things that I was taught in College was that it's called a four-second rule and this probably applies more towards general video production.

401
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:50,199
Speaker 0: But you never hold a shot for more than four seconds unless it's really justified because by that time you're going It's getting bored and what wants you to move on?

402
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:59,786
Speaker 0: I find that nowadays for general editing That's which one like a two-second rule and when you get down to the nitty-gritty with enemy music videos It's even smaller than that.

403
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:10,540
Speaker 0: you gotta have cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut and keep moving on to the next new thing And I think that's why there are more various videos is that People can't hold an idea for two and a half to three minutes or three and a half minutes.

404
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:18,745
Speaker 0: They've just come up with a bunch of short gags and short things that they can string together to One song.

405
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:29,300
Speaker 0: or in the case of the AMV hello projects Dozens of little snippets that are unconnected and unrelated and put together into one monstrous video and those are good.

406
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:34,473
Speaker 0: But I think that speaks to why there aren't as many good music videos these days.

407
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:38,207
Speaker 0: is because people just can't hold their attention Long enough to edit it.

408
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,717
Speaker 1: I agree with you so much.

409
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:40,180
Speaker 1: It hurts.

410
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:49,464
Speaker 1: Well, not just lazy time we won't get into that but just in the four years I was RIT in the anime club when I was a freshman I wasn't running the club or anything.

411
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:51,731
Speaker 1: Just watching it the average music video.

412
00:37:51,752 --> 00:38:06,518
Speaker 1: They showed was between three and five minutes long and some of the I mean there were literally ones I remember where it would just show a character kind of sitting there or like one Shot of a character walking for eight nine ten seconds, and they were good videos but they were just long and sentimental.

413
00:38:06,538 --> 00:38:18,282
Speaker 1: and In the four years until when I was eventually president of the club The videos that people hated those videos they boo if a video went on for more than two minutes and they bored They want it.

414
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:23,156
Speaker 1: The only videos they liked were robots fighting very quickly with effects or something.

415
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,400
Speaker 2: That was incredibly hilarious.

416
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:25,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, like.

417
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:29,680
Speaker 0: yeah funny funny is good, but action and well not actually effects.

418
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:37,149
Speaker 0: Overuse of effects for simply effects sake is another one of the downfalls of modern music videos in my estimation.

419
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:37,570
Speaker 0: Is that it?

420
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,428
Speaker 0: The getting back to the technology that human you guys mentioned know.

421
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:50,359
Speaker 0: there's so much of it out there now between premiere after effects Photoshop Sony Vegas and all the other professional stuff that's out there.

422
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,970
Speaker 0: It puts so much power at your disposal.

423
00:38:53,990 --> 00:39:11,758
Speaker 0: There's someone you can literally just throw an effect down Every second and of your entire song and probably not exhaust all the permutations that are available to you not and I'd be willing to bet that some people have actually tried that given the way things are these days, but Effects for effects sake are not good.

424
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:17,296
Speaker 0: Even if you're making a dance video, that's okay because you want to have something flashy and upbeat.

425
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:21,451
Speaker 1: that is yeah like Mambalayo, which is one of my favorite videos.

426
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a tight video.

427
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,780
Speaker 0: I like that one a lot because it's it's it's so tight.

428
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:29,058
Speaker 2: It seems like I think he used flash to make that a lot of it.

429
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,589
Speaker 2: Really, at least that's what it seems like.

430
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:33,680
Speaker 2: with like the I'd like the little stars going across.

431
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:38,784
Speaker 2: That's what someone told me.

432
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:41,594
Speaker 1: yeah, are you sure it wasn't no one.

433
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:43,200
Speaker 2: I'm sure someone told me that they use.

434
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,316
Speaker 0: Now you're gonna make me go to.

435
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:50,500
Speaker 2: It's not necessary?

436
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,782
Speaker 0: No, it isn't really.

437
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:55,468
Speaker 0: it was made in 2001.

438
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:58,840
Speaker 0: So I don't know flash was really that powerful at that point.

439
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,359
Speaker 1: Oh, well, no, I mean, I know it was around because I used it in classes at our IT.

440
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:03,923
Speaker 1: But

441
00:40:04,627 --> 00:40:04,829
Speaker 2: yeah,

442
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:16,500
Speaker 1: but at least in terms of you know People booing the five-minute videos in anime club by the time I was ready to leave I can tell you there's a glimmer of hope because even though the crowd got really uneasy and kind of restless during the long videos.

443
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:22,800
Speaker 1: They always stayed and watched him anyway, and a lot of times they would say things later to the effect of man.

444
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,087
Speaker 1: I started to realize that some of those things were good or they'd start to Recognize what a good video was.

445
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:35,799
Speaker 1: as long as we force them to watch them whether they wanted to or not It's like you give them the bad medicine and then they realize that the bad medicine makes them feel real good.

446
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:40,437
Speaker 2: And we always put whatever AMVs we showed on an FTP for people to download.

447
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,320
Speaker 2: if they came to the meeting.

448
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,694
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would always download them.

449
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:44,961
Speaker 1: they bitchin bitchin bitch Like.

450
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,780
Speaker 1: why'd you show that ten minute long full not ten minutes long?

451
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,648
Speaker 1: But the five-minute thing to kimigiri orange road.

452
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:52,133
Speaker 1: that was totally sentimental and lame.

453
00:40:52,554 --> 00:41:00,080
Speaker 0: and then they download that one more than anything Because they've had a chance to think about it and watch it again and digest it instead of simply trying to bolt it down.

454
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:07,700
Speaker 2: Or they're just crazy fans who like to collect every single possible video on their hard drives And then they have a stack of CDs or DVDs next to their computer.

455
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,496
Speaker 1: Hey anything that tricks them into watching good stuff and appreciating it is fine by me.

456
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:18,994
Speaker 2: Yeah Yeah, I just remember all those guys who would just they'd be like, oh I have seven bajillion music videos Am I in hard drive?

457
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:19,439
Speaker 2: Ha ha ha.

458
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:20,720
Speaker 1: Well, it's the same thing.

459
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,103
Speaker 1: We'd always trick people who didn't want to watch an old show to come into club by showing them flashy music videos and giving them Prizes and crap.

460
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:35,158
Speaker 1: but then we'd show them this old old old show that they'd talk about how much they thought they'd hate and then They'd love it and then they'd want to see more and a new anime fan would be born.

461
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,057
Speaker 0: Yes, but then you got to be a good parent.

462
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:46,886
Speaker 0: You've done it now Honestly, yeah, it does.

463
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:50,400
Speaker 1: it did get annoying what eventually people would keep asking the people who ran the club.

464
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:51,630
Speaker 1: Well, what should I watch now?

465
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:52,720
Speaker 1: I just watched all the Harlock.

466
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:55,428
Speaker 1: It wasn't it awesome when Captain Harlock did the block.

467
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:56,170
Speaker 2: Oh my god.

468
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:59,099
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's rather annoying fanboy people.

469
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,138
Speaker 0: If you saw him on Harlock, that's that's a pretty good start.

470
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,592
Speaker 2: I Think what the biggest showing ever was like the Macross Plus movie, right?

471
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:14,179
Speaker 2: Yeah, but then we showed that in 2000 So it wasn't too new back then it was still.

472
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:20,076
Speaker 1: There wasn't the biggest showing ever but it was definitely the biggest showing for many years in both directions at the club.

473
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:26,175
Speaker 0: Yeah There are a few there not too many things you can go wrong with.

474
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:31,332
Speaker 0: as far as Macross Plus is concerned I thought was Macross - Then you got a problem.

475
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:39,229
Speaker 2: I Took a tape of Macross - out of the club library.

476
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,919
Speaker 2: why I had to see what it was.

477
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:43,619
Speaker 1: I could have told you what it was.

478
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:47,456
Speaker 1: No, cuz Scott Johnson told me not to get it when I picked it up one day.

479
00:42:47,516 --> 00:42:48,460
Speaker 1: I didn't know what it was either.

480
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:51,712
Speaker 2: Oh, hey, you know, no one told me that was before.

481
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:52,675
Speaker 2: it must have been before.

482
00:42:52,716 --> 00:42:54,322
Speaker 2: so it was like one of the first things I took.

483
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:58,020
Speaker 0: so all right the opening theme kicks in is yeah, this is pretty good.

484
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,349
Speaker 0: And then you get to the dubbing and they speak.

485
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:01,675
Speaker 2: Oh, this was with something.

486
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,880
Speaker 2: This is a. this is a fan.

487
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:04,105
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

488
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,179
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you're lucky that the dub the dub is a no terror notoriously bad.

489
00:43:07,723 --> 00:43:10,179
Speaker 2: It was bad even with the fans up.

490
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:16,460
Speaker 1: Yes, true Alright, I think we can pretty much wrap up the AMV discussion.

491
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,965
Speaker 1: It was wonderful to have you on the show.

492
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:24,418
Speaker 1: God and to all you listeners out there who disagree with us suck it This guy's an expert and we agree on a lot of things.

493
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:30,815
Speaker 2: So anyone who comes back your elders kids comes on the forums and says blah blah blah.

494
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:34,803
Speaker 2: you guys are wrong about X Y or Z. well Sorry, we win.

495
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,610
Speaker 0: So I guess I'm on the forums too.

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,894
Speaker 0: So I'll know that he will.

Speaker 1: watch out though I guess for fun.

499
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:41,299
Speaker 1: We always like to do this.

500
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:44,480
Speaker 1: We'd like to ask one final question not related to anime music videos.

501
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,995
Speaker 1: But what would name your top three favorite anime?

502
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:53,276

503
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:55,947
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, it's a question.

504
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:58,820
Speaker 1: The whole internet is going to judge you based on this.

505
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,514
Speaker 2: You don't have to give a particular order or anything, you know, just okay.

506
00:44:02,835 --> 00:44:03,337
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll leave it.

Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

519
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:41,690
Speaker 0: I am a big fan of giant robot shows, but if I had to narrow it down to one I would probably have to say Mazinger's D because it is so over-the-top.

520
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,419
Speaker 1: you want to know something real special.

521
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:46,360
Speaker 1: Mazinger's D is the logo of the RIT anime club.

522
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,761
Speaker 1: No, it's.

Speaker 2: Oh great messenger, even though it's as poorly drawn as D version of them people know what it is.

Speaker 2: live or no rim doesn't pass.

534
00:45:16,302 --> 00:45:17,306
Speaker 1: It's not that I don't like it.

535
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,491
Speaker 1: Is that I don't love it.

536
00:45:18,512 --> 00:45:20,119
Speaker 2: I love it a lot.

537
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:25,340
Speaker 1: I definitely respect those movies for being all ten sides of awesome.

538
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:40,195
Speaker 2: I got screwed watching it though Cuz I tried to watch it in club on the tapes and the way they had the tapes at club was the first episode of the tape would be like OAV episode 1 and Then the other three episodes in the tape would be TV 1 2 3 and then tape - oh, yeah

539
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:42,363
Speaker 0: Tape

540
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:46,602
Speaker 2: 2 was OAV episode 2 TV 4 5 6.

541
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:47,304
Speaker 2: So I have.

542
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:52,239
Speaker 2: I didn't watch all the tapes cuz the year was over by the time, you know, I got halfway through.

543
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:56,839
Speaker 2: and So now I've seen like half of the OAV and half of the TV series.

Speaker 0: Akira Miyazaki films the whole gamut of Miyazaki films I love.

593
00:47:54,403 --> 00:48:05,120
Speaker 0: one of the very first scenes I ever saw as a budding anime fan was the car chase from the beginning of Castle Cali Ostro and it remains one of my favorite scenes of all time.

594
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:12,180
Speaker 0: Second maybe to the other car chase that takes place in one of the other lupin films.

595
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:16,980
Speaker 2: Conspiracy is by far the best.

596
00:48:17,842 --> 00:48:21,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, that in Cagliostro are neck and neck for the best Lupin in my eyes.

597
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:21,580
Speaker 2: That's right.

598
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,256
Speaker 2: We gotta buy that box that house the Lupin movies in it that just came out.

602
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:50,417

603
00:48:51,161 --> 00:49:02,919
Speaker 0: And this probably has nothing to do with the fact that two of my friends from long ago the Forester sisters Were one of the first to one of the first in the United States to do dirty pair cosplay.

604
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,047
Speaker 0: and Let me throw out an old fart memory for you.

605
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:15,275
Speaker 0: I think in project a project a con three or four They did a panel on how they built their how they constructed their costumes and so them.

606
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:17,040
Speaker 0: it was held in one of the hotel rooms.

607
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:29,360
Speaker 0: It was packed to the gills with sweaty fanboys and you could literally Feel the temperature in that room at least 10 degrees hotter than it wasn't.
