1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,675
Speaker 0: It's Thursday February 9th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,060
Speaker 0: We talk about Legos.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,136
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:21,799
Speaker 1: Guess who sat through hours and hours of meetings instead of actually doing work today?

5
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,199
Speaker 0: Guess who sat through hours and hours of not doing work today?

6
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:32,530
Speaker 1: I'd rather just be sitting in front of my computer at work doing nothing than sitting in a meeting having to pretend I care about what someone's saying to me.

7
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:34,400
Speaker 0: I'd rather be doing something.

8
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:39,959
Speaker 1: It was a meeting that didn't really involve me in any way other than the fact that I was there.

9
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,184
Speaker 0: Then why did you go?

10
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:42,268
Speaker 1: cuz I had to?

11
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,496
Speaker 0: they make you go to a meeting that doesn't involve you.

12
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:48,273
Speaker 1: most meetings involve me And I have to go to him and I really do have a reason to be there.

13
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,346
Speaker 1: this meeting was just kind of Pointless oh my god.

14
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:52,130
Speaker 1: Yeah,

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:58,801
Speaker 0: see I complained about not having to do anything But I really don't like meetings, and I'm very glad I have a job with no meetings And

16
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:04,422
Speaker 1: I don't get people who say they don't like meetings because I meet with people at work all the time to figure out What we're doing.

17
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,853
Speaker 1: I mean meetings are an integral part of what I do.

18
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:07,676
Speaker 0: I like doing.

19
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:08,620
Speaker 1: you know what I don't like.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,951
Speaker 1: I don't like stupid meetings.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,484
Speaker 0: I Just don't.

22
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,212
Speaker 0: I don't like jobs.

23
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:17,991
Speaker 1: with lots of meetings CS major coder you just sit there and type all day.

24
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,396
Speaker 1: I walk around and talk to people.

25
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:25,340
Speaker 0: as most of my job I'd like to walk around and talk to people, but I just don't want to have you know meetings in quotes.

26
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:27,367
Speaker 1: What do you mean meetings in quotes?

27
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,174
Speaker 1: all a meeting is is you talk to people?

28
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:30,218
Speaker 0: we have like an appointment.

29
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:30,760
Speaker 0: you go to the?

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,280
Speaker 1: Conference room and y'all sit down, and you know sometimes you got to talk to more than one person at the same time.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,043
Speaker 1: So you schedule it.

32
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:38,709
Speaker 1: yeah most meetings.

33
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,532
Speaker 1: I go to our.

34
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:43,434
Speaker 1: I sit there with all the people who are working on the same stuff I'm working on and we talk about what we're gonna do.

35
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:46,959
Speaker 0: I just talk about what we're doing while we're doing it.

36
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually we have to plan things out a little bit ahead of time.

37
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:54,529
Speaker 0: Someone writes a plan and then say hey everyone follows plan.

38
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,735
Speaker 1: no because it doesn't work that way.

39
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,848
Speaker 1: especially our person makes the plan Now because they need input from all the experts.

40
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,537
Speaker 1: I mean the one person doesn't know everything makes the plan.

41
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,605
Speaker 1: There's no expert who knows everything about everything.

42
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:08,425
Speaker 0: That's not good.

43
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:14,200
Speaker 1: I'll point out Scott that How many thousands and thousands of people work at the place I work?

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,751
Speaker 1: It's not a simple place to manage at all.

45
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:18,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I couldn't work at any place that big.

46
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:23,898
Speaker 1: I mean there's benefits while you don't really stand out in a company like that.

47
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:31,229
Speaker 1: You don't really stand out, and I'm fairly convinced that if I just stopped doing work entirely No one would notice for at least a month.

48
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,279
Speaker 0: No one's been noticing that I don't do work.

49
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,650
Speaker 1: No one notices when I do work, so they wouldn't notice if I did.

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,360
Speaker 0: and I'm in an office all alone one person.

51
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:43,140
Speaker 1: They only notice when they want something that they haven't assigned me yet.

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,579
Speaker 1: And then they they decide they need it and they stop noticing after I give it to them.

53
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,349
Speaker 0: hmm Yeah, let's escape work and do something else.

54
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,980
Speaker 1: all right, let's uh do that barge idea.

55
00:02:54,081 --> 00:03:04,005
Speaker 1: We'll have fights to the death on a barge in international waters And then publish the videos of the fights to the death on the internet and sell them not to mention allow rich people to fly Out to our helicopter thing.

56
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:13,170
Speaker 1: fly out to our helicopter pad on top of the barge and watch the fights and bet on the fights And then we kidnap the rich people Mmm, and we keep all their helicopters.

57
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:18,139
Speaker 1: nah, so anyway Halo 2 is coming out on the PC.

58
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:22,142
Speaker 0: Isn't Halo 2 been out for the Xbox like a zillion years I guess.

59
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:26,960
Speaker 0: didn't halo 1 come out on the PC like just about the same time it came out for the original Xbox?

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,177
Speaker 1: See the fact that Halo 2 is gonna be on the PC is not particularly interesting news.

61
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:35,237
Speaker 0: no The question why did it take so long is what I'm asking.

62
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:38,005
Speaker 0: I don't know I'm just pointing it out.

63
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,900
Speaker 1: I don't want to offend anyone out there, but Halo and Halo 2 are terrible games.

64
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I've played both of them.

65
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,138
Speaker 1: They're good for a console game as in a console FPS.

66
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:48,720
Speaker 1: They're all right.

67
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,909
Speaker 0: No, they're just goldeneye with updated graphics.

68
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is pretty good for a console game.

69
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,044
Speaker 1: FPS I guess.

70
00:03:55,425 --> 00:04:03,439
Speaker 1: but I mean what as you can do all the people out there who seem to like love Halo 2 never really played The golden age FPS is on the computer.

71
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:06,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, I used to think it was young punk kids You know.

72
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:12,553
Speaker 0: but my brother who has played much counter-strike and still plays counter-strike and whatever He doesn't like halo so much.

73
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,500
Speaker 0: He's like yeah, halo crap.

74
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:22,386
Speaker 1: I've never met anyone who played quake 2 and all the mods of quake 2 and play just all even the modern one.

75
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:27,866
Speaker 1: like tribes 2 tribes 1 any of those FPS's and Actually liked halo.

76
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:30,639
Speaker 1: the only people who like halo seem to be people who have never played a real FPS.

77
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:32,630
Speaker 0: People suck at real FPS's.

78
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:34,379
Speaker 1: no no those people play UT.

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,500
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but the news here is that halo 2 will only run in Windows Vista.

80
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:57,153
Speaker 1: alright I'm not sure if this is due to because they haven't said if it's going to be due to a technical specific limitation of Non-vista windows which seems highly unlikely unless maybe you know DirectX 10 considering.

81
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:02,849
Speaker 0: It's an Xbox one game or They're just gonna put some arbitrary.

82
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,693
Speaker 1: Oh, we've detected.

83
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:04,658
Speaker 1: You're not running Vista.

84
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,045
Speaker 1: therefore No, halo for you.

85
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:10,300
Speaker 0: This is just messed up because first of all who wants to play halo 2 on the PC?

86
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,384
Speaker 0: It's been out on the original Xbox for months and months and months and months and months and honestly That's where it shines.

87
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:19,340
Speaker 1: You can't really play a game like that with keyboard and mouse and expect it to be good.

88
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,164
Speaker 0: Oh, you can.

89
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:23,080
Speaker 0: actually you can play halo 1 with the keyboard mouse, and I've done it.

90
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,040
Speaker 0: The problem is is you just basically kick the shit out of everything.

91
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,291
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like it was the easiest thing ever played.

92
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:29,015
Speaker 0: it played the demo.

93
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:29,920
Speaker 0: It was so easy.

94
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:30,903
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

95
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:36,540
Speaker 1: It really only works when everyone's on equal footing with the handheld controller instead of a mouse and keyboard.

96
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:49,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even know why they release it for the PC But maybe you can play it with the Xbox 360 controller that plugs into the PC or maybe Microsoft has an evil evil evil stupid conspiracy plot where they'll put it out on the PC.

97
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:55,259
Speaker 1: It'll sell like crap because it's also on Vista and then they'll just be able to say yeah PC gaming is dead.

98
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:56,554
Speaker 1: Xbox is the way to go.

99
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:02,560
Speaker 0: No, I think what they're gonna try to do is they're gonna try to sell copies of Vista by this way.

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Speaker 0: Is that people who want halo 2 for the PC and are ultra super gamers who spend zillion dollars in video cards anyway?

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,793
Speaker 0: Putting halo 2 on the PC for Vista only will make all those people upgrade to Vista.

102
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:21,979
Speaker 1: see they may think that but honestly Anyone who wants halo already has an Xbox and is already playing the game as well as they're ever gonna play it.

103
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:35,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, but from the thing that makes me disagree with that is what I heard on the PC gamer podcast today, which was scary is They were talking about upgrading PCs, which we've talked about like a thousand times and he's like is it worth it for me to upgrade?

104
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:46,130
Speaker 0: My you know PC to play this game and they did some math, which is the same math I would have done which is price of video card plus price a game Divided by hours of gameplay.

105
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:53,345
Speaker 0: and they were like, oh, okay so you play that if you played that for 125 hours, which is There are very few games.

106
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:55,293
Speaker 0: I've played for over 125 hours.

107
00:06:55,534 --> 00:07:00,508
Speaker 1: Maybe like counter-strike I'd submit that natural selection is natural selection.

108
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:02,569
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah Not many.

109
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,908
Speaker 0: is the point That it would still be about three dollars an hour?

110
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,679
Speaker 0: and then they said that's a great deal.

111
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,624
Speaker 0: now $3 an hour.

112
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,855
Speaker 0: The only thing that costs more than three dollars an hour is playing games in the arcade.

113
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:16,360
Speaker 0: That's just insane.

114
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even MMOs.

115
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:19,358
Speaker 1: don't cost you that much.

116
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:29,530
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean an MMO of 20 bucks a month if you play an hour a day, that's less than the dollar an hour you know, so three dollars an hour is insane for a game to cost.

117
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:42,008
Speaker 0: so Paying if you add the cost of Vista to the cost of halo 2 for the PC to the cost of the PC required to run that and Then divide by the number of hours.

118
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,358
Speaker 0: You're gonna play games that require all of that.

119
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:46,228
Speaker 0: You're not gonna.

120
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:47,579
Speaker 0: it's not gonna be good.

121
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:52,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of not even just the cost of all that.

122
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:58,474
Speaker 1: but Windows Vista is in many ways a step backward From current versions of Windows that you can already buy.

123
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,744
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I mean we've talked about it before.

124
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:05,879
Speaker 1: but Vista you can't install drivers unless Microsoft approves them and it's not like.

125
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,142
Speaker 1: oh It'll warn you.

126
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:08,566
Speaker 1: Hey, this driver's unsigned.

127
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:09,349
Speaker 1: don't install it.

128
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,853
Speaker 1: It really won't let you.

129
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:13,140
Speaker 1: you don't have root access to your own machine anymore.

130
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:17,940
Speaker 0: At least it'll really Bring down PC game cheating.

131
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:19,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:25,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it'll also bring down playing my items of dubious copyright.

133
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:28,821
Speaker 1: job status Absolutely.

134
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,732
Speaker 1: I mean I want to be able to play all my mp3s.

135
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,679
Speaker 1: I want to be able to download all my devices.

136
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,650
Speaker 0: That's why I run Linux or a Windows XP.

137
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a firewall.

138
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:40,359
Speaker 0: You know what?

139
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:46,739
Speaker 0: Um Somehow I don't think halo 2 for the PC is gonna be this giant draw that they think it is.

140
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,736
Speaker 0: I mean how well did halo 1 for the PC do?

141
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,460
Speaker 0: I don't think it did that.

142
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,920
Speaker 1: Well, well, I consider look at the list of the top games last year and they were all sims games and World of Warcraft.

143
00:08:56,783 --> 00:09:05,313
Speaker 0: so for a while now They've been planning on getting rid of analog television, you know when you stick the antenna on your roof and you just watch channel 3 4 & 5 with an old TV.

144
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:13,760
Speaker 0: and And There's been fights and they keep changing the date when they're gonna cut it off and all kinds of crap.

145
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:18,468
Speaker 0: today the President Bush signed a law.

146
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,994
Speaker 0: So this is set in stone.

147
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:27,810
Speaker 0: It's a law for real on February 17 So far into the future.

148
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,118
Speaker 1: I don't even give a shit.

149
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:32,470
Speaker 0: They're gonna turn off all the analog television.

150
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,240
Speaker 1: that that information is almost useless to anyone.

151
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:37,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one cares.

152
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:44,179
Speaker 0: Well, all the people who plan on using antennas in 2009 do know cuz they don't even know and they won't know.

153
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:46,932
Speaker 0: They won't know until their TV stops working.

154
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:47,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

155
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:48,440
Speaker 1: That's fine.

156
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:51,379
Speaker 1: This is I mean, this is an issue that I really don't care about at all.

157
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:52,898
Speaker 0: That could be because we don't watch TV.

158
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:54,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

159
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,942
Speaker 1: But think about it.

160
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:59,240
Speaker 1: most people who watch TV in this country have cable because there's really nothing or satellite.

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,700
Speaker 1: Yeah They have some sort of pay service that will continue to work no matter what.

162
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:07,779
Speaker 1: This only screws the poorest of the poor who probably shouldn't be watching TV anyway.

163
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:09,404
Speaker 0: But that's the problem.

164
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:14,000
Speaker 0: is the people who watch the most TV or the poorest of the poor because they have no jobs And they sit at home all day?

165
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,677
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised because all that a lot of people who work or have jobs or just most people in this country Just watch a lot of TV.

166
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:22,885
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah they sure do.

167
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:29,060
Speaker 0: but the point is is that The those people watch TV when they get home from work when they wake up in the morning and on the weekend.

168
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,260
Speaker 0: The poor people watch TV all day.

169
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:41,735
Speaker 0: That's why you see all those, you know cheap really low-class talk shows on during the you know Late morning afternoon times because that's when all the poor people are watching.

170
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:50,594
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Yeah, yeah way to uh paint poor people with a broad brush a little a little bit of a broad brush there You know painting them with it.

171
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:54,612
Speaker 0: It's mostly accurate then in America.

172
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,200
Speaker 1: See the thing is I'd be I'm all for this.

173
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,240
Speaker 1: I wish it happened sooner because maybe it'll force people when they can't watch the TV anymore to do something else for a little while.

174
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'd have to get a job in order to buy digital television.

175
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:12,019
Speaker 1: Well, no because you know, the government's gonna subsidize upgrades for everyone doesn't say that here.

176
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,165
Speaker 1: Yeah But the government's already said they will.

177
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,912
Speaker 1: they've earmarked a whole ton of money.

178
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:28,800
Speaker 1: a lot of the money that's gonna come from the sale Of the spectrum that TV is currently on is going to go towards subsidizing Digital converter boxes for everyone in the country who needs them so that people will still be able to watch TV.

179
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:30,999
Speaker 0: We'll see about that because you know what?

180
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,737
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go get me a digital converter box and do some nice hacks with it because it's a free electronics.

181
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:37,138
Speaker 0: I'll take it.

182
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:39,285
Speaker 1: They're gonna subsidize it.

183
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,068
Speaker 1: It won't be free.

184
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,635
Speaker 1: You'll just get like a rebate if you buy it.

185
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,343
Speaker 0: There's fine cheap electronics Great.

186
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,228
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do with that?

187
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:45,416
Speaker 1: You'll be able to watch TV.

188
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:45,798
Speaker 1: whoo.

189
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,806
Speaker 0: I'll be able to do some other stuff with it.

190
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,893
Speaker 1: Like what you can barely solder.

191
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:51,940
Speaker 0: It's a digital analog converter.

192
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:57,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are you gonna do with this specific piece of technology that is made to do one specific thing?

193
00:11:57,762 --> 00:12:06,900
Speaker 1: I don't know but make magazine will tell me Yeah, I don't think I've seen you in the history of me knowing you so much as touch of soldering iron.

194
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:08,257
Speaker 0: I know how to use them.

195
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:16,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, I made a burglar alarm like a few years ago a few years ago Yeah, a few years ago.

196
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,329
Speaker 1: You were still living with me.

197
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:20,778
Speaker 0: I didn't see any burglar alarm more than more than a few.

198
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,543
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, we're talking.

199
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,406
Speaker 1: what high school?

200
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,996
Speaker 0: No, no, no talking always a me middle school.

201
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,993
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe high school Maybe high school.

202
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,385
Speaker 0: Yeah So I know what I'm doing.

203
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:33,628
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

204
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,370
Speaker 1: yeah do plus.

205
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,162
Speaker 1: you realize that these boxes are not going to be simple pieces of Electronics.

206
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,445
Speaker 1: they're going to be mostly digital.

207
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:44,219
Speaker 0: It's not like the project is gonna be totally worth the low price plus the.

208
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:53,420
Speaker 1: It's not like the projects you do in school where you know You make an oscillator and there's a giant resistor and a giant capacitor and big wires between them.

209
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,706
Speaker 1: You can see where everything's going.

210
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,940
Speaker 1: It's probably mostly pre-printed boards and pre-printed chips.

211
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:04,783
Speaker 0: There'll be some sort of firmware hack and then I'll get my computer to do something and then name anything.

212
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:06,992
Speaker 1: you think you could use a DAC for?

213
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:09,963
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

214
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,773
Speaker 0: some sort of awesome myth TV hackers.

215
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:23,880
Speaker 0: No, you don't need that that I'd be able to pick up the digital tee the HD TV out of the sky and write it to my hard drive With an analog, you know, there's not get one.

216
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,780
Speaker 1: There's not going to be so much HD TV in the sky to begin with especially not where we live.

217
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:30,028
Speaker 0: Why not there?

218
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:39,727
Speaker 1: you realize I we don't have an antenna But I talk to people at work and because of the mountains where we live there are maybe Two channels that you can get over the air.

219
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,956
Speaker 0: currently aren't there any a TV station.

220
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:46,124
Speaker 0: local TV stations now Like a Poughkeepsie TV station.

221
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:47,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't get it.

222
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:48,029
Speaker 0: Wow.

223
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,599
Speaker 1: Apparently there's almost no watchable television over the airwaves here.

224
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:55,634
Speaker 0: Well, even in Rochester, there was a TV station like right there.

225
00:13:55,654 --> 00:14:00,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, but your grand total Even if we had an antenna in Rochester, there were only a few channels.

226
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:06,880
Speaker 0: I guess I kind of spoiled because where I'm from we got you know, two whole states worth of TV channels.

227
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was from in Michigan.

228
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,939
Speaker 1: We got about 20 channels just over the air.

229
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:13,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we had like a zillion over-the-air channels.

230
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,811
Speaker 0: We didn't switch the cable for the longest time because they didn't need to thing.

231
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,964
Speaker 1: is I remember as a kid watching more Canadian TV Than American TV.

232
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need Canadian TV, but I watched mostly New York TV.

233
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,620
Speaker 1: Canadian TV was frickin awesome.

234
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,688
Speaker 1: There was two kinetic you realize instead of Saturday morning cartoons.

235
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,995
Speaker 1: There's this one Canadian channel channel 9.

236
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:29,977
Speaker 1: It was Saturday morning.

237
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,121
Speaker 1: learn science Mm-hmm.

238
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,107
Speaker 1: I remember watching all these just shows.

239
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,151
Speaker 1: that like remember mr.

240
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:35,572
Speaker 1: Wizard.

241
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:36,033
Speaker 1: Yep.

242
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:37,116
Speaker 1: These shows make mr.

243
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,220
Speaker 1: Wizard look like crap.

244
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,883
Speaker 1: These shows were like Like.

245
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:42,488
Speaker 1: I remember one specifically.

246
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:52,352
Speaker 1: it was this guy and he was just lecturing on Bernoulli's principle and how it worked and how airfoils work And it was an hour long and I was like six and I just ate that crap up Alrighty.

247
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:56,914
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe that's why Canadians have fewer issues than we do down here.

248
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:58,600
Speaker 0: They still have their issues.

249
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,672
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they have their issues, but you know what.

250
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:07,279
Speaker 1: at least they debate their issues I guess in open forums, they may not come to good solutions, but at least they try.

251
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,513
Speaker 0: Supposedly at least they have a facade of trying and anything.

252
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:13,039
Speaker 0: we don't even have that.

253
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,666
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

254
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:28,600
Speaker 1: you all know and love spider-man from his various movie comic and book appearances in the u.s.

255
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:36,640
Speaker 1: spider-man, but spider-man has another incarnation a giant robot fighting incarnation.

256
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,099
Speaker 0: See you can only be Japanese.

257
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, Japan made its own spider-man and here it is our friend.

258
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,900
Speaker 1: Kate pointed us to this and oh my god.

259
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:54,000
Speaker 0: At first I thought it was just the 1960s live-action American spider-man TV show dubbed in Japanese and made funny.

260
00:15:54,341 --> 00:16:01,865
Speaker 1: See, I don't know because it starts immediately with you know, various Japanese things that are obviously Japanese.

261
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:03,620
Speaker 0: I didn't I wasn't paying attention so much.

262
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,896
Speaker 0: I just saw a live-action spider-man dancing around.

263
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:18,520
Speaker 0: but then When you get to the giant robots and stuff and the plot doesn't match the plot of spider-man in any way whatsoever Well, there's a scene where the giant robot has got spider-man from a web and he's swinging him around.

264
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,243
Speaker 0: It's not even a web.

265
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:21,994
Speaker 1: It's a rope and then he just whaps him into a tree.

266
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,078
Speaker 0: is how he can.

267
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:23,600
Speaker 0: it's a mountain.

268
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,366
Speaker 0: He smacks him into a mountain.

269
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:26,089
Speaker 0: It's insane.

270
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,394
Speaker 0: And then spider-man just gets up.

271
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,905
Speaker 1: It's it's oh my god This is worth watching.

272
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,915
Speaker 1: The subtitles are all fake as far as we can tell.

273
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:38,100
Speaker 1: Yeah Like but many parts of the subtitles seem very inaccurate.

274
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:44,919
Speaker 0: Well, it seems like some parts were relatively accurate or at least kind of make sense, even if they're not accurate.

275
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:52,717
Speaker 0: But other parts are just made silly on purpose Which is I say it's better because you don't really want to know what they're saying.

276
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:53,340
Speaker 0: It might be painful.

277
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:56,939
Speaker 0: Actually reminds me of a story.

278
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:01,740
Speaker 0: My brother's friend had a job dressing up a spider-man and going to kids birthday parties.

279
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,660
Speaker 1: Wow, that sounds kind of creepy and shady.

280
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:09,339
Speaker 0: It's actually apparently like spider-man was like the number one thing to have at your birthday party or something.

281
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think it was like that but then he got fired for not showing up.

282
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,079
Speaker 1: Well getting fired from a job like that is yeah, yeah.

283
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,619
Speaker 0: There's another story about a guy who had the same job and a bunch of dreadlocks.

284
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:31,702
Speaker 0: But then you know He would go to get the money from the parents and you take the mask off and all these dreadlocks would come out and they'd Be like, whoa Whatever that's it.

285
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,408
Speaker 1: Yeah story didn't go anywhere.

286
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,956
Speaker 0: No, it was just the dreadlocks didn't kill anyone.

287
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:37,240
Speaker 1: The dreadlocks really didn't matter.

288
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,248
Speaker 1: No, why even tell that story cuz they're hit?

289
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:48,699
Speaker 0: it doesn't look like he has them when he puts the spider-man mask on and then And you go They just kind of go rip and disappear if you don't want them out.

290
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:51,954
Speaker 0: It's kind of like a little secret identity thing going on, you know, yeah.

291
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:52,235
Speaker 0: Yeah.

00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:30,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, they took a whole bunch of them and they made this giant scene.

305
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,753
Speaker 0: That is all Call of Cthulhu action.

306
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,480
Speaker 0: They've got little like a biplane.

307

309
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:43,530
Speaker 1: It is definitely Playing the Cthulhu game.

310
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely Call of Cthulhu the RPG action.

311
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:55,370
Speaker 1: a bunch of guys from the 30s with various crap pistols and Tommy guns going after Treasure on an island and Cthulhu comes and eats them.

Speaker 0: This is Zeppelin.

317
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:16,954
Speaker 0: It's like you look at this and you could use this as like your representation for when you play the game You know with your friends word.

318
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:29,399
Speaker 0: I Just really enjoy looking at all the different like parts of it like there's the one people picking mushrooms and You know the people near the phone booth or whatever the hell it is.

319
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:35,962
Speaker 0: there's the one guy who was like the tentacle going into him with this like these the red bush and The.

320
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:39,220
Speaker 0: the red bush actually looks like blood because they stuck it on his chest.

321
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:44,200
Speaker 0: So it looks like the blood is just exploding out of his stomach because the tentacle hit him in the back here.

322
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,745
Speaker 1: Look, I can see.

00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:50,300
Speaker 0: They make it great.

327
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:54,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, peruse it in detail much like the pictures of Mexico City.

328
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,975
Speaker 0: So yeah, I wasn't lying.

329
00:19:56,055 --> 00:20:08,159
Speaker 1: our show today is about Lego because basically we were doing that show on the toys of our geeky, you know nerd fest lives of children and We realized there's much more to that topic than we could do in one show.

330
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:13,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Lego which is like this major toy in everyone's life at least every geeky kids life.

331
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:17,036
Speaker 1: There were a lot of kids where I grew up who didn't have any Lego or thought they were stupid.

332
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:17,639
Speaker 0: none.

333
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:21,834
Speaker 0: Well, everyone I knew at least had some Lego if not much.

334
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,540
Speaker 1: I had an extensive collection.

335
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,893
Speaker 0: See I was big into the castle Lego and whenever we went to Toys R Us.

336
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:41,136
Speaker 0: We either got an NES game or Lego Start I started out real big with the real life sets like the race car type stuff like Race car set that came with two little race cars in the track.

337
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:41,799
Speaker 0: That was a good one.

338
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:51,653
Speaker 1: Yep that or any just like normal buildings and stuff and of course just big blocks and boxes like the houses and the Trees and yeah, yeah little town people.

339
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, we weren't big into those sets.

340
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,484
Speaker 0: I think we had two of them.

341
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,350
Speaker 0: mostly I had castle sets.

342
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,420
Speaker 0: can they gets wizards dragons?

343
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,204
Speaker 0: castles Castles catapults.

344
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:10,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, I only had one castle and then I had some knockoff not Lego but kind of compatible with Lego castle And I had mostly the space stuff.

345
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:13,060
Speaker 1: I remember when the ice planet came out I got all that.

346
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ice planet was wicked cool cuz they had those orange chainsaws and stuff.

347
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:18,140
Speaker 1: You know the orange jemmies?

348
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:20,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I only got actually one.

349
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:22,640
Speaker 1: Oh, I got the frickin bass.

350
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:28,700
Speaker 0: I got only one snow planet thing which was this one guy who had a chainsaw and like a snowmobile.

351
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,765
Speaker 0: It was actually really fun But I had that guy.

352
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:36,460
Speaker 1: but I also had the full-on bass and like the big Magnetic thing and my brother had all this space stuff.

353
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Speaker 0: He had like two snow bases in the snow a spaceship and whatever, but I was mostly into the castle.

354
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:47,818
Speaker 1: I think the best part of the the ice planet stuff was that all the little sleddy things had.

355
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,524
Speaker 1: the little sleds They worked really well on carpet.

356
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:52,613
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but I got the bright idea one day.

357
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,720
Speaker 0: This is who all the guys had skis do.

358
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:59,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went outside into the snow in our front yard with my brother.

359
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:04,613
Speaker 1: Let me tell you that was one of the best days of playing with Lego I ever had until you lost all your white Legos in the snow.

360
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:06,080
Speaker 1: Actually, I lost almost nothing.

361
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,452
Speaker 1: I was real careful almost nothing and you know what?

362
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:12,826
Speaker 1: I found the rest in the spring Before the lawnmower got him.

363
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:16,100
Speaker 1: you don't mow the lawn for quite some time after the snow melts.

364
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:30,540
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, actually when I got castle stuff, we I mostly got they had in those days It was the Knights which are like actual guys with black castles and armor and swords and things.

365
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:35,260
Speaker 0: Yep, and then you had this Robin Hood set which was like these guys who are all elfish.

366
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,869
Speaker 0: They weren't elves, but they were like forest Rangers.

367
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:41,040
Speaker 1: There was definitely some animosity between these two groups.

368
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:41,741
Speaker 0: Yeah They had.

369
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:54,525
Speaker 0: they already were all green and they had hats and you could change the feathers in the hats and I had feathers of Every color and I would you could tell the rank of the guy based on how big his feather was and what color it was.

370
00:22:54,946 --> 00:23:06,560
Speaker 0: so the guy with like the triple white feather was like Robin Hood and Every like little John had like the triple red feather and the people with like this single tiny little white You know like blue feathers.

371
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:12,399
Speaker 0: Those were normal schmucks and they had bows and arrows and quivers and you know all kinds of great stuff.

372
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:18,960
Speaker 0: They even had this giant castle with a trap with a with a portcullis that opened and closed with a rope.

373
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,427
Speaker 1: I never had their castle.

374
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,452
Speaker 1: I just had all their guys.

375
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:22,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had all.

376
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,000
Speaker 0: I had that castle.

377
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:24,223
Speaker 0: I had their.

378
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:31,131
Speaker 0: the best set was the one where there's a river and this bridge that went over the river and they were like Little towers in either end of it.

379
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:32,178
Speaker 0: Ooh, that was a good one.

380
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:41,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I would set that up and then I would sit the castles up on the other side and then the horses marched At each other and shoot arrows and yeah, you know that sort of thing.

381
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:59,844
Speaker 1: Yep I had kind of epic battles with my little brother and me and we build each of us had it like pretty much identical sets of Legos and we build giant like Giant giant freaking complex bases for all our guys and every now and then we'd agree and we just kind of this ongoing kind of war.

382
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:03,022
Speaker 1: I Mean.

383
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:03,947
Speaker 1: we came up with a little.

384
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:06,120
Speaker 1: you know little kids like Calvin ball type rules.

385
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,300
Speaker 1: We're like he put a door in the front.

386
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,431
Speaker 1: So I was like I walk in and then he put a thing is like that.

387
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:12,040
Speaker 1: now it's locked and it really was locked.

388
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:13,436
Speaker 1: So crap now my guy can't get in.

389
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:15,758
Speaker 1: You know stuff like that.

390
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:22,798
Speaker 1: We had this whole currency system where various pieces were worth more or less money or value depending how rare they were.

391
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:26,269
Speaker 0: Story of the space shuttle.

392
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,937
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can tell the story of the space shuttle But you know like there were the little gold pieces from the pirate set.

393
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:31,238
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

394
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:34,119
Speaker 1: I had one tiny set of the gold between us.

395
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:38,820
Speaker 1: So those are like the rarest like a piece of gold was worth like a million normal pieces.

396
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,566
Speaker 0: Yeah The Pirates are some of the best ones.

397
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:45,264
Speaker 0: actually I had one pirate tower that was like this island with a tower on it And some guys with guns.

398
00:24:45,324 --> 00:24:46,328
Speaker 0: they weren't actually pirates.

399
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:52,271
Speaker 0: They were the anti pirates and I planned to get pirates But I always just bought castles instead.

400
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:52,692
Speaker 0: I don't know.

401
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:54,440
Speaker 0: I like the pirates.

402
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,968
Speaker 0: I'd go to the store and he said like a pirate ship and then I'd be like ooh a pirate ship But then I would see a giant castle.

403
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:01,115
Speaker 0: I'm like a giant castle.

404
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:01,920
Speaker 1: one thing I had though.

405
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,854
Speaker 1: I didn't have the pirate ship But there was a big red boat that was like a barge and you could.

406
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:09,979
Speaker 1: it was a Lego thing and you could put Legos In it and make various types of boats.

407
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:12,491
Speaker 1: It also actually floated.

408
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:17,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a white Speed boat that was like six inches long and four inches tall.

409
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:19,560
Speaker 1: I always wanted that but I never had it.

410
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,729
Speaker 1: I had the giant red boat.

411
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:28,076
Speaker 0: There was like a foot and a half long Yeah and you could just put Build any kind of boat on top of it and then it actually had a little slot.

412
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,160
Speaker 0: if you got the motor.

413
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,052
Speaker 1: I got the motor that no one I knew ever had.

414
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,240
Speaker 0: I don't know how you got the motor.

415
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:40,270
Speaker 0: I didn't see it for sale anywhere But if you got it You could attach it to this boat and it would go around but as long as you didn't weigh this down with a piece of Metal it would float.

416
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:41,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did it Once.

417
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:45,999
Speaker 1: I made a boat that had a big tower in it and then it tipped over and filled with water and sank.

418
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:50,980
Speaker 1: But I we used to play in the pool actually had an above-ground pool in our backyard.

419
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:55,658
Speaker 1: I'd take that thing out there and we'd have guys swimming around in the water and fighting with each other.

420
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:56,260
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

421
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,464
Speaker 0: yeah, we put it in the pool once but Didn't last very long.

422
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:04,519
Speaker 1: when I was real real little we used to take it to the bathtub with me constantly.

423
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:10,120
Speaker 0: It was one of my first Legos, oh man, I could talk forever about my bathtub toys and I was a little kid.

00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay Well, I consider my DS a bathroom toy.

439
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:48,146
Speaker 1: I'll often play the DS while I'm sitting in there doing my various Leanings of my body.

440
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,291
Speaker 0: so Lego.

441
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:50,416
Speaker 0: Yeah Lego.

442
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,320
Speaker 0: All right.

443
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:55,839
Speaker 1: So this current like my brother like the gold pieces were rare and we had.

444
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,194
Speaker 1: you know There's a briefcase that came with one set that snapped open.

445
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:00,519
Speaker 1: You could fit some gold pieces in it.

446
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:04,180
Speaker 1: That was like the most powerful rare awesome thing because there was only one.

447
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,373
Speaker 1: We always figured that there were like the nuclear secrets in it or whatever.

448
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,140
Speaker 0: All right, I never saw that.

449
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:10,571
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what said.

450
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:10,955
Speaker 1: it came in.

451
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:11,479
Speaker 1: We had one.

452
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:14,348
Speaker 1: Okay and the best thing is you know the little jammie pieces like.

453
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:19,892
Speaker 1: there's the like the yellow ones and what the clear ones for headlights and Like the various different ones.

454
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:20,680
Speaker 1: you used them for various.

455
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:20,921
Speaker 1: yeah,

456
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:34,160
Speaker 0: cuz originally the yellow ones were used as gold and I would take a treasure chest and I would just dump a bunch of Those in there and then eventually when the pirate sets came out They actually had these little flat gold pieces with numbers on them, which is different.

457
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:39,620
Speaker 1: Yep All I remember is that we we'd assign various because the gems were also energy.

458
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:48,640
Speaker 1: Like if you want to make a laser gun, you had to have the jammie things on it Or if you wanted to have whatever I mean, but I had various laser security systems being a geeky little kid.

459
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:57,688
Speaker 1: But the orange ones from the ice planet set were the most powerful because they were the rarest because we had the fewest of them Mm-hmm, and I remember I took the freaking.

460
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,837
Speaker 1: you know, the ice planet had that giant orange shield thing over it.

461
00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:02,705
Speaker 1: Yeah I used that.

462
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:06,601
Speaker 1: I put it around my base and oh man, that was just nuts Mm-hmm.

463
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:10,033
Speaker 0: I remember my brother had a space set with a giant blue shield.

464
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:11,800
Speaker 1: Oh, I never had that set.

465
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,086
Speaker 1: There was also a set with because there was.

466
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:14,452
Speaker 1: there were three space sets.

467
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,160
Speaker 1: the ice planet set came much later.

468
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:25,560
Speaker 0: Yeah This is like a research dome that had this thing had came with the two vehicles that would drive around Picking stuff up and it came with a ship like oh, yeah a separate set.

469
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,450
Speaker 0: There was a robot but its head would fly off as a ship.

470
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:30,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never had that idea.

471
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:31,540
Speaker 0: and shuttle type of ship?

472
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,160
Speaker 1: See, I remember there were two different sets of space guys.

473
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,306
Speaker 1: There were the guys who were like all.

474
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:38,705
Speaker 1: they were all like blackish and they had the yellow shields And oh, this wasn't it.

475
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,820
Speaker 1: and there were the other guys that had the bluish jammies and the bluish shields.

476
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the bluish guys with.

477
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:44,191
Speaker 1: I think those were the good.

478
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:47,978
Speaker 0: they were all white ships with blue translucent stuff.

479
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:51,228
Speaker 0: That was those I think were the main space guys.

480
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forget what they actually called this stuff.

481
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:54,760
Speaker 0: They actually had names for it.

482
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,368
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I never knew it even as a kid.

483
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just kind of mish-mashed everything together.

484
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:02,829
Speaker 1: I mean when our guys would fight, you know They'd run into each other and my brother and I would do a battle.

485
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:08,143
Speaker 1: some guys have sword some guys have musket Some guys have laser guns Whatever.

486
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:09,226
Speaker 0: What's up Lego?

487
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:18,540
Speaker 0: all of the different Lego sets seem to have this plot in this universe, you know Sort of like a campaign setting but they never explain any of it to you and there's no way to find out about it.

488
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:18,942
Speaker 1: You know what?

489
00:29:18,962 --> 00:29:21,657
Speaker 1: That's good because there's just enough there kids.

490
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:30,915
Speaker 1: as kids We were cognizant of the fact that there were these different clans of Lego guys and that there was some sort of conflict between them And our fertile minds created the rest of it.

491
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:37,019
Speaker 0: even today They have what like the bionicle or whatever and there's something to it, but I have no idea what the hell it is.

492
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:38,869
Speaker 0: You know, what's the story of bionicle?

493
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:39,673
Speaker 0: does these guys?

494
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,000
Speaker 0: they're bionicles?

495
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,519
Speaker 1: See I remember I had the story of the ice planet was a harsh and unforgiving place and my Lego men were trying to survive in the face of adversity.

496
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:50,870
Speaker 1: The reactor would break and then they always let.

497
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:57,300
Speaker 0: the story of the ice planet was that Normal space guys wanted to do some research there and but it was very harsh.

498
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:02,856
Speaker 0: So they had to you know build bases and do terrible things like sort of like Antarctica.

499
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:04,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

500
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:18,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played different things all the time and the story of the castles was that the Robin Hood guys were fighting against the evil monarchy which is all dark and evil had wizards and witches and things and the Robin Hood guys were all Valiant and such.

501
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,113
Speaker 1: I remember the glow-in-the-dark ghost.

502
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:21,780
Speaker 0: Oh my god the glow-in-the-dark ghost.

503
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:27,409
Speaker 0: I had like two or three glow-in-the-dark ghosts because I got the Tiny $5 glow-in-the-dark ghost set.

504
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:33,197
Speaker 0: then I got a big castle with a glow-in-the-dark ghost in it And I got something else at the ghost but he was awesome.

505
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:49,280
Speaker 1: now It seems that Lego was very defined like things click in in very rigid ways but I seem to recall that almost every kid came upon a number of Innovations or discoveries regarding Lego pieces and it seems that these discoveries are universal among children who are geeks.

506
00:30:50,361 --> 00:31:01,820
Speaker 1: The first I remember is that if men were fighting with swords or Spears or whatnot you could always kind of crack the guy's Abdomen open a little bit and stick the sword in him and then leave him there dead with the sword sticking out of his back.

507
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:06,200
Speaker 1: Yep, every kid did that or you know, you'd have the guy laying there dead.

508
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,715
Speaker 1: You'd pull his hand out still clutching the sword and put it in front of him.

509
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:10,318
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

510
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:18,016
Speaker 1: the one thing I remember really big was I captured one of my little brother's guys once and He wouldn't pay the ransom.

511
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:22,751
Speaker 1: so what I did is I executed him, you know the whip the green whip Mm-hmm.

512
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:28,354
Speaker 1: I used that as a hangman's noose and I made a gallows and I put it around the guy's neck and I hung him From my battlements.

513
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:29,138
Speaker 0: Yes.

514
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:35,262
Speaker 0: He I usually use those whips not as whips but The forest men the Robin Hood type of guys.

515
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:47,070
Speaker 0: They always had this green greenery in all their Buildings to make it look like trees and stuff And I would put these as vines hang from the trees and guys would do sort of a Tarzan thing with them.

516
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:48,759
Speaker 0: Ah get around.

517
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,064
Speaker 1: I really only used him as hangman's nooses, though I remember when I was young my mother yelling at me for doing something so horrible.

518
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:57,030
Speaker 0: Yeah My mom didn't really pay attention.

519
00:31:58,072 --> 00:31:58,975
Speaker 1: Well, she did cuz my.

520
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:02,587
Speaker 1: we were real young and I remember my brother crying that I killed one of his guys.

521
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:09,075
Speaker 0: Yeah So Legos today really aren't the same as they were when we were Playing with them.

522
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:12,050
Speaker 1: No, there seem to be so many specialized pieces.

523
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:15,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like back in the day when I made these castles and things.

524
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,770
Speaker 0: I made a mostly like 90% out of just Lego bricks.

525
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,449
Speaker 0: Occasionally, there'd be a weird piece like the things that a little window in them.

526
00:32:24,912 --> 00:32:28,730
Speaker 0: But you get a whole bunch of those that became like a standard piece for castles.

527
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:29,915
Speaker 0: It was like a castle piece.

528
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:32,766
Speaker 1: Like I remember getting airplanes and they were just.

529
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:33,830
Speaker 1: it was all just normal pieces.

530
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,182
Speaker 1: There was nothing special to him at all.

531
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:40,930
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Eventually all the sets I'd bought became cannibalized into this giant mishmash of pieces.

532
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:45,102
Speaker 0: Yeah nowadays and you buy a set it's like it's all there's like.

533
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:53,390
Speaker 0: there's like barely any normal Lego bricks in there And it's all like specialized pieces that are used to make specifically that thing.

534
00:32:53,711 --> 00:32:57,603
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the problem is that Legos last forever.

535
00:32:58,004 --> 00:32:59,609
Speaker 1: You can't freaking destroy the things.

536
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:08,778
Speaker 1: I mean, I think maybe of all the Lego pieces I've ever had one got destroyed because our dog ate it And then when he pooped it out, no one wanted to touch it.

537
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:16,870
Speaker 1: I think we definitely destroyed one Lego piece Or two Like some of the little things like a sword would break or a spear.

538
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,523
Speaker 0: Sometimes in some piece got stuck somewhere and you couldn't separate it.

539
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,610
Speaker 0: We would like hammer at it or something.

540
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,276
Speaker 1: Oh, didn't you have the separate II thing?

541
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:27,790
Speaker 1: We got the separate II thing, but I never was unable to separate two pieces.

542
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:32,084
Speaker 0: Sometimes you're unable to separate something from like the baseboard if there's some.

543
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,475
Speaker 0: if there was some hot and cold involved Baseboard that was cake.

544
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,184
Speaker 1: I never had I never ruined a baseboard.

545
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,350
Speaker 0: No, we didn't ruin the base.

546
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,747
Speaker 0: We're in the piece attached to it.

547
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,603
Speaker 1: But even so 99% of Lego pieces last forever.

548
00:33:43,764 --> 00:33:44,527
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

549
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,270
Speaker 0: I still got all mine.

550
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,538
Speaker 0: I should bring them here for fun.

551
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:47,424
Speaker 1: I want mine here.

552
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:48,792
Speaker 1: as soon as I go to Arizona I'm have.

553
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:50,059
Speaker 1: I'm shipping them all back to my son.

554
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,810
Speaker 0: next time I go to my house and put them on my car.

555
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:53,858
Speaker 1: Oh, you know you realize we get Lego.

556
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:57,050
Speaker 1: That's the end of the podcast cuz that's the end of video games.

557
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,915
Speaker 1: That's the end of everything.

558
00:33:58,217 --> 00:33:59,425
Speaker 1: There's gonna be at least a week of us.

559
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:00,290
Speaker 1: Just playing with Legos.

560
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,790
Speaker 0: I'll have to get the instructions how to build on my castle sets again.

561
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:07,010
Speaker 1: I'm totally gonna build the most gigantic empire of death you could imagine.

562
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:09,377
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go buy a new Lego.

563
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:10,100
Speaker 0: Of course.

564
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,449
Speaker 0: I can't buy a castle real castle Legos anymore.

565
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:24,730
Speaker 1: But because they're so enduring it seems like in order to maintain the market of selling more Lego because parents can just keep passing their Legos on to their kids forever They keep coming out with these new sets with more and more specialized pieces that you can't get any other way.

566
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:26,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do like.

567
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,706
Speaker 0: some of the new sets though like the Star Wars ones are always good.

568
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:29,770
Speaker 1: yeah, they're alright.

569
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,583
Speaker 1: They still have a lot of pieces that just really only work in those one specific guys.

570
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:36,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like that at all.

571
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,449
Speaker 0: like You know what to call like the front of a spaceship will be like this pointy bit.

572
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,920
Speaker 0: It's like come on that point even it's not useful for anything.

573
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,829
Speaker 0: It's only useful there for the fronts of spaceships.

574
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, all that is I mean even because in the war between me and my brother.

575
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:54,908
Speaker 1: it finally ended when one day I put together $70 and bought the US Space Shuttle set.

576
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:56,860
Speaker 0: Was it the Columbia or the?

577
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:56,981
Speaker 0: what?

578
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:57,545
Speaker 0: What was it?

579
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:58,310
Speaker 1: I don't know.

580
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,274
Speaker 1: all I know is it was huge and Like it had it wasn't.

581
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:09,756
Speaker 1: it was the Space Shuttle and all the pieces like all the part bits of it the solid rocket boosters and the liquid tank Mm-hmm, and it was a baseboard.

582
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:16,294
Speaker 1: and it was the entire like Tower and the thing that held it up and all these little Wiry rope.

583
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,829
Speaker 0: things damn rules up to it the the launch pad that drives around like a tank.

584
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,120
Speaker 1: That's the only thing it didn't have.

585
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,569
Speaker 1: it had everything else.

586
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:25,434
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

587
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:25,955
Speaker 1: And you know what?

588
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,640
Speaker 1: There was not a single specialized piece in that whole thing.

589
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:33,510
Speaker 1: The entire Space Shuttle and everything was created entirely with normal Lego bricks.

590
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:37,187
Speaker 0: It didn't have like just you know, a solid rocket booster.

591
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:37,890
Speaker 0: That was one piece.

592
00:35:38,265 --> 00:35:45,697
Speaker 1: No The solid rocket booster was made with you know, this the fort the four by one the two by two by one Lego pieces that were cylinders.

593
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:47,063
Speaker 0: Oh my god, that's awesome.

594
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:54,075
Speaker 1: It was made with just a whole ton of them Yeah, and then at the top there was one of the coney ones that goes into a one at the top and then you stuck a normal.

595
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:56,633
Speaker 1: I Don't know what to call it.

596
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:57,778
Speaker 1: They're little cone things.

597
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know not the cylinders, but it was a cylinder, but it combed out.

598
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,814
Speaker 0: I know what you're talking about.

599
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, those went in the top great.

600
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:05,370
Speaker 1: The whole thing was just normal pieces.

601
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:09,630
Speaker 0: So the what about the middle liquid fuel tank thing?

602
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,950
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure if I recall correctly was just a bigger cylinder thing that you still had to put together.

603
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:15,819
Speaker 0: Oh, I never seen a cylinder that big.

604
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:16,502
Speaker 0: that'd be interesting.

605
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,070
Speaker 1: I forget exactly how it was made.

606
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,876
Speaker 1: I've got the pieces.

607
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd like to see those pieces.

608
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:28,189
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the only close thing is that's in the big red tower that held it up There were a few like, you know, the castle pieces with the window in them.

609
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,697
Speaker 1: you know, there are some pieces that were.

610
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:36,336
Speaker 1: there were of that type, but they were more like buttressing or like just Fortification type stuff.

611
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:36,879
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

612
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,426
Speaker 1: But other than that, it was just regular pieces.

613
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:48,033
Speaker 0: Wow See nowadays you would get a solid rocket booster piece and a fuel tank piece and like shuttle door pieces You know what?

614
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,886
Speaker 1: If I got something like that, why don't I just buy a model of a space shuttle?

615
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:51,610
Speaker 1: It's not Legos.

616
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I mean friggin.

617
00:36:53,893 --> 00:37:00,025
Speaker 1: the doors on the shuttle were normal Lego pieces that you could even find in other sets with the little hinges and everything.

618
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:02,735
Speaker 0: Like my brother has a Lego x-wing right.

619
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:05,322
Speaker 0: the four wings are like these wing pieces.

620
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:10,169
Speaker 0: Ah, it's just like these big triangular flat Legos And it's like that's so terrible.

621
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:11,694
Speaker 0: Couldn't they make some sort of?

622
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:13,079
Speaker 0: you know something if they?

623
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:21,057
Speaker 0: I think the problem is that if you don't make a piece like that You have to make it bigger and thus more expensive with more plastic Yeah, which I was fine with.

624
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:23,910
Speaker 1: I remember Lego caused more than Nintendo games most of the time.

625
00:37:24,171 --> 00:37:25,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the giant.

626
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:29,110
Speaker 0: I never had the biggest castle of them all even though I wanted it cuz there's a hundred bucks.

627
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:32,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted the monorail more than anything when I was a little kid.

628
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,690
Speaker 0: No one ever got the monorail.

629
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,917
Speaker 0: Little Lego catalog Lego catalog.

630
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:38,141
Speaker 0: whenever you bought Legos you got it.

631
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:42,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you'd always stare at that monorail like oh my god I'd be the coolest kid ever.

632
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,209
Speaker 1: This would be the most awesome thing in the world.

633
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,203
Speaker 0: You'd always look through there, and you'd be like all.

634
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:49,719
Speaker 0: look at set number 6 4 2 1 that's the greatest ever.

635
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:55,062
Speaker 0: oh look you can buy a set of guys And they come with all those extra items that I don't have.

636
00:37:55,083 --> 00:38:00,250
Speaker 1: I remember on Christmas time time I'd always take the catalog and circle all the things I wanted and give it to my parents.

637
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:06,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember my circle almost everything I remember doing that, but I remember not getting really anything from the catalog ever.

638
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:16,719
Speaker 0: yeah Once I wrote a letter to Lego, and I told them to they should make a set that was army guys like tanks and stuff And they said yeah, it's great.

639
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,628
Speaker 0: They sent me a letter back and that that was it.

640
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:24,533
Speaker 0: But I'm surprised they don't make army guys Lego You know what.

641
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:29,130
Speaker 1: definitely let's get our Lego and play with them, and then put pictures online of what we've done.

642
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:32,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, we definitely got to make cool cthulus with them.

643
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:33,289
Speaker 1: cuz just imagining it.

644
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,301
Speaker 1: now I really have this urge to play with some Lego.

645
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:38,977
Speaker 1: yeah me too like badly I. I have an urge to play with Lego.

646
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:44,748
Speaker 1: that's stronger than my urge to play with any piece of entertainment or video game or anything that I currently own.

647
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:47,618
Speaker 0: I Really hope that all that we've.

648
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,938
Speaker 0: I think this podcast will be considered successful If all our listeners have the same.

649
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:55,130
Speaker 0: I want to play with Lego urge and have no Legos available.

650
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:55,994
Speaker 1: So you know what?

651
00:38:56,074 --> 00:39:02,293
Speaker 1: once we get our Lego shipped out here if any of you live nearby We'll totally hang out and play with Lego Mm-hmm.

652
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:05,990
Speaker 0: I got dibs on all the horses horses whatever.

653
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,457
Speaker 1: They don't need no stinking horses.

654
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:10,969
Speaker 1: I'll shoot them with my laser guns and my lightsabers.

655
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:13,845
Speaker 0: ah Good thing my horses are made of plastic.

656
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:14,370
Speaker 0: They won't die.

657
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so that's probably enough about Lego.

658
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:22,601
Speaker 1: if I talk about him anymore I'm just gonna go nuts because I don't have any to play with.

659
00:39:22,802 --> 00:39:23,164
Speaker 0: I agree.

660
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:27,759
Speaker 0: so in Podcast news yeah some meta bits.

661
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,290
Speaker 0: yet the the podcast reviewer.

662
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,581
Speaker 0: Who's this guy who I guess has a podcast of reviewing podcasts?

663
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,407
Speaker 0: I've listened to him a couple times.

664
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:35,849
Speaker 0: He's all right.

665
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:44,621
Speaker 0: I found out about him, and I asked him to review us and To my surprise he actually reviewed us which was kind of amazing.

666
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:47,730
Speaker 0: yeah, he didn't really say that much about us.

667
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,519
Speaker 0: I think he was a little sick and a little tired.

668
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,550
Speaker 0: You know recently in his life, so I can't really blame him.

669
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:59,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been tired for the last couple weeks, so I've been a little off and your banter hasn't been the greatest lately But we're just tired.

670
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:03,723
Speaker 0: Yeah, our lives are busy very busy, but he reviewed us.

671
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:11,330
Speaker 0: He said what I considered be mostly compliments But one thing he wanted was there to be separate feeds for separate days.

672
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,817
Speaker 0: You know people were only interested in anime only want to listen on Wednesday and people only interested in games want to listen on Tuesday only.

673
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:24,609
Speaker 0: so Little did he know that WordPress, which is what our site runs on already has this set up.

674
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:31,130
Speaker 0: But I just didn't make nice easy links for everyone to use because I was gonna wait until we had the new theme ready.

675
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:35,210
Speaker 1: Yep, because we're working on that yeah, and we'd actually come up with the idea way back.

676
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,216
Speaker 1: We were gonna just do it for the anime one.

677
00:40:37,598 --> 00:40:44,423
Speaker 1: when we realized that I mean we do four podcasts a week Which the more we're learning is that that's insane.

678
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,970
Speaker 0: it is very bad people.

679
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,221
Speaker 1: That's fucking insane and no one does that.

680
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:49,890
Speaker 1: like once a week is even a lot.

681
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:59,267
Speaker 1: Yeah Most people record much much less podcasts than we do so our one day a week of anime is more anime Podcasting than most anime podcasts out there.

682
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:07,980
Speaker 1: So we were thinking we were gonna make a separate feed burner feed and everything for a geek nights anime and market it Separately even though we haven't done any marketing at all.

683
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,750
Speaker 1: yet everyone listens is just all word-of-mouth, which is cool.

684
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway.

685
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:17,528
Speaker 0: I made a post on you know front row crew calm You can see it right up there at the top.

686
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:28,381
Speaker 0: well I guess now it'll if once he posts this podcast they'll be the second one down and it has links to the raw Not so clean, but fully functional.

687
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:32,596
Speaker 0: Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday Separate podcast feeds.

688
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:39,507
Speaker 1: I'd hold off on subscribing to him since sometime soon We're gonna set up real feed burner nice feeds for him.

689
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:42,254
Speaker 0: well They'll work, and they'll work forever.

690
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:50,446
Speaker 0: just fine, but they won't have all the meta information properly like The name of the episode the name of the show what track?

691
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:54,385
Speaker 0: well I love the track numbers some of it some of it will be there and some of it won't be.

692
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:58,863
Speaker 0: I just I can't tell You what will be there and what won't be but it won't be clean.

693
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:00,530
Speaker 1: use these at your own peril.

694
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:01,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll work.

695
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:03,201
Speaker 0: I guarantee it'll work.

696
00:42:03,241 --> 00:42:03,723
Speaker 0: Just fine.

697
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,470
Speaker 0: You'll download the mp3s and listen to them.

698
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:14,542
Speaker 1: You just won't have all the correct information surrounding them though the thing is I think all the people who currently listen Probably just I mean if they're not interested in anime.

699
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:19,069
Speaker 1: they probably listen to the first half of anime day And then they tune out when we start talking about the anime mm-hmm.

700
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:24,750
Speaker 1: I mean we really we strive to have some sort of common geekery every day.

701
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,908
Speaker 1: That's why we do the news and things of the day And then we delve into the specifics so people who aren't interested in one topic can just tune out whenever they want.

702
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,728
Speaker 1: yeah But it seems like everyone is listening really wants to listen to every one of them.

703
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:44,544
Speaker 0: Some people have expressed a desire to only listen one day, so I'll let those people they can do as they wish.

704
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:54,330
Speaker 1: and plus the nice If I set up the feed burners, that's why I want to do that I'll get nice statistics on how many people and who are listening to what so we'll know what bits are popular.

705
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:58,070
Speaker 1: It'll give us a lot of good data to figure out how we can make the show better.

706
00:42:58,332 --> 00:43:00,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is a one important thing.

707
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:07,269
Speaker 0: But for now if you really really just want to listen to one of the days of the week or a couple of them There are separate feeds.

708
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:08,132
Speaker 0: I made links.

709
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:15,054
Speaker 1: you can use those until later when we have them more official now of course if you listen to most or all Of them or anything.

710
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:16,258
Speaker 1: just subscribe to the main one.

711
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:18,025
Speaker 1: don't bother subscribing to all of these.

712
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:19,290
Speaker 0: it won't help you silly.

713
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:27,756
Speaker 1: This is really only for someone who really only wants to listen to our Monday podcast Tuesday or Wednesday or Friday.

714
00:43:27,996 --> 00:43:28,759
Speaker 0: we don't do Friday.

715
00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:33,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah if we did Friday if we did full five days a week We probably die.

716
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:35,186
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be here right now.

717
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:35,588
Speaker 0: I'd be dead.

718
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:40,430
Speaker 0: They'd be like this tombstone and a picture of it, and that's all that would be on the website.

719
00:43:40,854 --> 00:43:42,690
Speaker 1: Though I gotta say we're getting a lot better at this.

720
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:49,475
Speaker 1: I mean we've pretty much gotten down all our ways of interviewing people online or over the phone whatever though We're trying out some more software.

721
00:43:49,676 --> 00:43:52,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could use a little more interviewing experience.

722
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:52,806
Speaker 0: I think.

723
00:43:53,127 --> 00:44:00,810

730
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:31,078

Speaker 0: those are the days.

734
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,550
Speaker 1: half of it is us arguing with each other about what to say.

735
00:44:53,990 --> 00:45:05,250
Speaker 1: Awesome, but once we really I like once we actually started doing episodes after we got the mixer and the microphones and everything It took about an hour and a half to do post-production on a given episode.

736
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:13,830
Speaker 1: now It takes about a half hour and most of that time is waiting for my crap ass slow computer to finish processing my filters.
