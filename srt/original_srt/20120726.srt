1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,656
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, July 26th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:16,149
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,810
Speaker 0: The book club, we bring you Haruki Murakami's Q-Teen 84.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,726
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,150
Speaker 0: Or 1Q84, as you know, I alternate the pronunciation depending on what I said last.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,049
Speaker 1: Or Ichi-Q-Hachi-On.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,683
Speaker 0: Yup.

8
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:36,499
Speaker 0: It is a trilogy.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,330
Speaker 0: Well, it's three books, but anyway.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,999
Speaker 1: But, yeah, in Japan, that's how they publish novels.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,550
Speaker 1: Like here, when you buy a novel, you get the novel, right?

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,890
Speaker 1: In Japan, like a novel that you'll buy here that's like a lot of pages, in Japan will be like multiple small volumes.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,477
Speaker 1: You can buy little tiny books all separately.

14
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:57,270
Speaker 1: They break things apart, whereas here, we like to collect things together to get like the omnibus edition.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,100
Speaker 0: Ah, but at the same time, look at Books Like Prince of Nothing.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,109
Speaker 0: It has big parts that are broken up.

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:12,210
Speaker 1: Right, but the thing is, in Japan, I think the reason they do that is that when you go to the bookstore, you get a whole bunch of books that are all the same size and shape, and they all just line up.

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,649
Speaker 1: So it's like they just, you know, break your book apart that way.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,290
Speaker 0: You realize some of our younger listeners might be asking what you mean by a bookstore.

20
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:31,890
Speaker 1: It is true, but I mean, even having, even in the days of internet, right, having all the books be relatively the same size and shape is really good for robots to pick the books out to send them to you.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:40,850
Speaker 0: Well, remember a time before the industry fixed itself, when you went to buy a PC game, there was an arms race of the sizes and shapes of boxes.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like, who can make the biggest box to stand out on the shelf?

23
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,270
Speaker 1: And then they're like, all right, guys, look, all PC games will be in the same size box.

24
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,890
Speaker 1: And now PC games don't even have boxes anymore.

25
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,787
Speaker 0: Yep, but there was a time when you could not fit.

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,029
Speaker 1: I did get Starcraft 2 in a box, and it was a standard Starcraft box.

27
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:05,430
Speaker 0: But I mean, I have old game boxes that literally you cannot put any of them on a shelf next to any other one of them without using up the entire shelf, basically.

28
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now you just download the books and the games.

29
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,356
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what's crazy?

30
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,262
Speaker 0: I was cleaning up stuff.

31
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,369
Speaker 0: You know what I found the other day?

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,273
Speaker 0: I was in my bin of stuff to get rid of.

33
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:23,112
Speaker 0: I found a VHS tape and an empty beta tape case because we had a beta VCR at 1.2.

34
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:27,850
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, those beta cases were gigantic and had like this weird foam around them.

35
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,229
Speaker 0: Kind of like remember the old Disney movie clamshells for VHS tapes?

36
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:31,666
Speaker 1: Yeah.

37
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,890
Speaker 0: They had like that soft cover with the plastic like ridges coming out.

38
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:36,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

39
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:37,507
Speaker 0: Good times.

40
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:38,164
Speaker 1: OK.

41
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,230
Speaker 0: I feel like anyway.

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,461
Speaker 1: Let's hurry this up.

43
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,310
Speaker 1: So Google.

44
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,416
Speaker 1: It's been a long time coming.

45
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:47,430
Speaker 1: They promised they were going to bring awesome Google ISP to some city.

46
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,677
Speaker 0: Never mind that we speculated as nerds.

47
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,790
Speaker 0: What, like eight years ago when they started buying up dark fiber.

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,822
Speaker 1: But anyway, they're going to do it in Kansas City.

49
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,010
Speaker 1: We knew this is old news.

50
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,998
Speaker 1: But the news is that they actually.

51
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,970
Speaker 1: you can now pre-register for it if you live in Kansas City.

52
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,020
Speaker 1: And they even posted the plans.

53
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,508
Speaker 1: So check out these plans.

54
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:05,830
Speaker 1: You ready?

55
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,795
Speaker 1: These are unbelievable plans.

56
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:12,550
Speaker 1: If this is available in every city, all the other ISPs and cable providers would be fucked.

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,032
Speaker 1: Here we go.

58
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:13,274
Speaker 1: Ready?

59
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,910
Speaker 1: The middle plan, the least exciting plan.

60
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,254
Speaker 1: Seventy dollars a month.

61
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:19,096
Speaker 1: Right.

62
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,019
Speaker 1: For Internet only.

63
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:23,810
Speaker 1: However, it's gigabit ethernet.

64
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,990
Speaker 1: That's the least exciting plan is fucking gigabit ethernet.

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,880
Speaker 0: Now, now we know that's a trillion.

66
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,310
Speaker 1: That's a billion bits a second.

67
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,490
Speaker 0: We know that net neutrality is already a problem in the rest of the world.

68
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,638
Speaker 0: But regardless of how that shakes down, I'm on Google.

69
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,310
Speaker 0: Ninety nine percent of my downloading bandwidth usage is actually not Pirate Bay anymore.

70
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,072
Speaker 0: It's YouTube.

71
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:47,454
Speaker 1: Right.

72
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,097
Speaker 1: But here's the thing.

73
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:51,110
Speaker 1: So, Ram, you have files, right, which is pretty much the awesomest.

74
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,901
Speaker 1: How what's the speed on that right now?

75
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,790
Speaker 0: I got twenty five, twenty five.

76
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:56,894
Speaker 1: So twenty five.

77
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,346
Speaker 0: There's a new deal for almost the same money.

78
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,270
Speaker 0: I could get fifty fifty.

79
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:01,835
Speaker 1: So fifty.

80
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,380
Speaker 1: So let's say you get fifty fifty.

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,690
Speaker 1: That's fifty megabits of fifty million bits.

82
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:12,570
Speaker 1: How many fifty million bits are there in a billion bits?

83
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,838
Speaker 0: Well, how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

84
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,244
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, Kansas.

85
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,769
Speaker 0: Why can't you be New York?

86
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:18,250
Speaker 1: Right.

87
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,334
Speaker 1: So, wait, that's plan.

88
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,019
Speaker 1: That's the boringest plan.

89
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,830
Speaker 1: Here's the is the next plan that is more exciting.

90
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,263
Speaker 1: The free Internet plan.

91
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,209
Speaker 1: It's not totally free.

92
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,989
Speaker 1: You have to pay three hundred dollar installation fee, construction fee.

93
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:31,270
Speaker 1: Right.

94
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:34,197
Speaker 1: So, but it's zero dollars a month.

95
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:38,610
Speaker 1: You can also finance the three hundred dollar construction fee and pay twenty five dollars a month for twelve months.

96
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,950
Speaker 1: And then it's free from then on forward or pay three hundred lump sum and it's free forever.

97
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,197
Speaker 1: And you get normal.

98
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,510
Speaker 1: It doesn't say exactly what the speed is, but you get normal Internet speeds.

99
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,370
Speaker 1: Basically what I get now for nothing.

100
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,190
Speaker 1: That's pretty crazy, especially for poor people can get awesome Internet.

101
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,426
Speaker 0: Now, what's interesting is I don't see this reflecting in Google stock or like any.

102
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,830
Speaker 0: I don't think it's only in one city.

103
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:10,009
Speaker 0: But the plans for this, like the industry of cable provision and ISPs.

104
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,830
Speaker 1: And I feel it's only one city and it's not a super major city.

105
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:24,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, for now, it's not the smallest city now, but I note that the rest of the industry doesn't appear to be doing anything to prepare for this nuclear bomb that's about to drop.

106
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,090
Speaker 1: Well, it's only going to hurt them if this actually branches out to places.

107
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:35,430
Speaker 1: And if Google can actually it's costing Google, it took them a long time and a lot of infrastructure and a lot of pain in the ass to get this to even work.

108
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,710
Speaker 1: So the difficulty of even getting this in New York will take many, many years.

109
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:43,550
Speaker 1: And our market cares about the short term, so they're not worried yet.

110
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:44,358
Speaker 1: All right.

111
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,530
Speaker 1: Now, here's the crazy plan.

112
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,512
Speaker 1: Are you ready?

113
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:54,830
Speaker 1: Gigabit Internet and television, which is all, by the way, HD television with a fuck ton of channels, including the all important NFL network.

114
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:55,715
Speaker 1: All right.

115
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,889
Speaker 1: One hundred and twenty dollars a month.

116
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,135
Speaker 1: But here's the craziness.

117
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:07,230
Speaker 1: Not only do you get the TV and the gigabit Ethernet, they also give behind door number three.

118
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:11,210
Speaker 1: You get to your contract because you're locked into this thing, right?

119
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,640
Speaker 1: There's no data cap whatsoever.

120
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:14,364
Speaker 1: You can just go nuts.

121
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:15,710
Speaker 1: I don't use a data cap on any of this.

122
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,217
Speaker 1: You get a Nexus seven tablet.

123
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,150
Speaker 1: You get a TV box, which is like the cable box for the TV.

124
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:24,655
Speaker 1: You get a storage box, which is basically.

125
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:30,750
Speaker 1: they give you a free NAS, a Google branded NAS, which is also sort of like an Apple time machine thing.

126
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,415
Speaker 1: The network box, which is the router.

127
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:34,057
Speaker 1: Right.

128
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:39,530
Speaker 1: And they give you one terabyte of space for your Google drive in the cloud.

129
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,473
Speaker 1: So you don't have to pay for that either.

130
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:50,670
Speaker 1: So it's even though it's one hundred twenty dollars and you're paying for TV and Internet, you get all these crazy bonuses to go with your other action.

131
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,810
Speaker 1: You actually if you get the seventy dollar plan, that also includes the no data caps and the Google drive, but not any out of the stuff.

132
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:00,117
Speaker 0: So, Scott, I'm a reasonable man.

133
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,080
Speaker 0: This seems ludicrous.

134
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,870
Speaker 0: Like there's no way I could possibly be a true thing.

135
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,021
Speaker 0: Sounds like a scam.

136
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:05,869
Speaker 0: Is there any downside?

137
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,416
Speaker 1: It's a pre-registration right now.

138
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,922
Speaker 1: So when they're actually going to set it up, who knows?

139
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,090
Speaker 1: It's you know, you're basically like, do they get all my info?

140
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,302
Speaker 1: You're basically they get to watch me basically in the beta test for this.

141
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,770
Speaker 1: So who knows how well it will actually work.

142
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,598
Speaker 1: But yeah, I would sign up for this.

143
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:24,581
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

144
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,350
Speaker 0: Yes, I've already sold my soul to Google.

145
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,025
Speaker 1: Let's leave New York and move to Kansas City and start a nerd town there.

146
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,090
Speaker 1: And yeah.

147
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,935
Speaker 1: It's really cheap to live there.

148
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:38,529
Speaker 0: All right, so I might.

149
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:42,910
Speaker 0: Well, no, I will, because I just booked plane tickets, be in Sao Paulo next week.

150
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,330
Speaker 0: So geek nights between all the stuff that's going on might come or go.

151
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,830
Speaker 0: But, you know, I'm going to Sao Paulo for work and I work in the stock market, everything else.

152
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,550
Speaker 0: Pay attention to the stock market, but I don't work for a broker dealer so I can talk about stock stuff.

153
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,690
Speaker 1: SCC doesn't give a shit about you without getting in trouble.

154
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,837
Speaker 0: SCC doesn't care.

155
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,247
Speaker 1: SCC says you can say whatever you want.

156
00:07:59,267 --> 00:07:59,690
Speaker 1: We don't care.

157
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,050
Speaker 0: You know, I have to follow the regulations of, you know, anyone talking about stocks, obviously.

158
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:16,710
Speaker 0: So way back, I posited that perhaps Facebook was a crass cash grab, that the IPO was ridiculous, that Facebook was peaking and that it was a poor investment.

159
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:21,529
Speaker 0: Well, Facebook stock has basically done nothing but go down since it IPO'd.

160
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:28,830
Speaker 0: And today earnings came out and Facebook dropped another like eight and a half percent.

161
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,070
Speaker 0: And it's down even further in aftermarket trading.

162
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:32,688
Speaker 1: All right.

163
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:37,429
Speaker 0: And as far as I can tell, that was on the news that they beat some expectations.

164
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:40,254
Speaker 1: Okay.

165
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:42,169
Speaker 1: So what did the market do today?

166
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,761
Speaker 0: The market was up, actually.

167
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:46,310
Speaker 0: The market was fine.

168
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,689
Speaker 1: See, when a stock does the same thing the market did, then that means nothing.

169
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the market was down eight and a half percent, Scott, that would be huge news.

170
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,750
Speaker 0: The stock market dropping three percent is a pretty big deal.

171
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:58,192
Speaker 0: Yeah.

172
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:01,550
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Facebook, I've said it before, I'll say it again.

173
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:06,210
Speaker 0: I think Facebook has peaked or is peaking in the current, like, three year window.

174
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,270
Speaker 0: Like, it's pretty much going to be all downhill from here.

175
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,469
Speaker 0: Facebook is going to go the way of Myspace.

176
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:17,090
Speaker 0: It's just going to take longer than it took Myspace to collapse.

177
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,850
Speaker 1: None of these things have any staying power.

178
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:20,987
Speaker 1: All Internet things come and go.

179
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:21,310
Speaker 1: Right.

180
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,930
Speaker 1: You know, one minute, you know, in our lifetimes, we've seen things.

181
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,790
Speaker 1: We've seen many, many things that look journal.

182
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,452
Speaker 0: Right.

183
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:29,366
Speaker 0: America Online.

184
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,351
Speaker 1: Right.

185
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:30,915
Speaker 0: It's America.

186
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,309
Speaker 0: Remember, AOL, Time Warner.

187
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:34,072
Speaker 1: Yeah.

188
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:34,614
Speaker 1: It's like you.

189
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:38,050
Speaker 1: let you go back in time and it's like, wow, Windows rules the world today.

190
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,089
Speaker 1: No one says that, even though they still sort of do.

191
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:40,956
Speaker 1: AOL.

192
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,220
Speaker 1: Wow.

193
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:41,849
Speaker 1: They're the kings.

194
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,041
Speaker 1: No one can stop them.

195
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:43,930
Speaker 1: They run everything.

196
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:44,956
Speaker 1: They're gone now.

197
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,910
Speaker 1: Effectively, you know, mostly right.

198
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,593
Speaker 1: Yahoo.

199
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:47,836
Speaker 1: Wow.

200
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,249
Speaker 1: That's the search engine, guys.

201
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,257
Speaker 1: No one get up.

202
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:51,328
Speaker 1: Oh, Google.

203
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:51,550
Speaker 1: Right.

204
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:53,637
Speaker 1: All just in need.

205
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,030
Speaker 1: And it's only been like 20 years ish of Internet.

206
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:02,750
Speaker 0: So my question is, how come no one who is not a technologist ever sees this coming?

207
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:03,293
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:04,910
Speaker 1: Every nothing is permanent.

209
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,679
Speaker 1: Whatever feels like it's the unbeatable monopoly that runs.

210
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,689
Speaker 1: everything is going to go away in less than 10 years.

211
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:13,530
Speaker 1: That has been the way of the Internet and the technology.

212
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,990
Speaker 0: Well, if we if we widen a little bit, there was one exception.

213
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,950
Speaker 0: Nintendo pretty much was number one for a long, goddamn time.

214
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,251
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,477
Speaker 1: Everything comes and goes.

216
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,990
Speaker 1: Sometimes you make a comeback, even Apple made a comeback.

217
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

218
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,968
Speaker 1: Nintendo sort of went away, came back when they came back.

219
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:28,150
Speaker 1: Right.

220
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:28,933
Speaker 1: It happens.

221
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:32,490
Speaker 1: But nothing is in the technology sector.

222
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,930
Speaker 1: You cannot get a lock even when you were a seeming monopoly.

223
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,291
Speaker 1: All right.

224
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,707
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

225
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,216
Speaker 0: Well, yes.

226
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:46,930
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

227
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:55,250
Speaker 0: So if I had to rate jokers that I like, but if I had to rate them solely on their laugh.

228
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:56,214
Speaker 1: Mark Hamill.

229
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,770
Speaker 0: Mark Hamill is the undisputed champion.

230
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,850
Speaker 1: I mean, Jack Nicholson was not too bad.

231
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,969
Speaker 0: Jack Nicholson had a better crazy face.

232
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:06,113
Speaker 1: Yeah.

233
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:07,710
Speaker 1: But I mean, his laugh wasn't bad.

234
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,469
Speaker 0: He was more like the old Batman Joker style.

235
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:14,561
Speaker 1: Why didn't they include the 1960s Batman laugh?

236
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,241
Speaker 1: What's his name?

237
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:17,890
Speaker 0: Cesar Romero.

238
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,352
Speaker 1: Yeah.

239
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,149
Speaker 1: I knew it was like Romeo something.

240
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,629
Speaker 1: How come he wasn't included in this video?

241
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,474
Speaker 1: I don't know.

242
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:28,070
Speaker 0: Basically, we've got Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Mark Hamill.

243
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,030
Speaker 0: And it is basically a compilation of different laughs that they have done.

244
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,270
Speaker 0: And if you watch this, it's just going to remind you that the Joker is pretty much one of the best villains ever.

245
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:41,045
Speaker 1: Kind of.

246
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:42,556
Speaker 0: All right.

247
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,929
Speaker 0: Superhero comics.

248
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:49,709
Speaker 0: Name better villains that are actually better that you want to go watch stuff with them in it.

249
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:51,343
Speaker 1: Kind of like Magneto.

250
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:51,789
Speaker 1: He's pretty cool.

251
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,598
Speaker 0: Magneto is pretty good.

252
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:53,063
Speaker 0: He's up there.

253
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:55,535
Speaker 0: All right, Scott.

254
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,201
Speaker 0: All right, Scott.

255
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,309
Speaker 0: DC villains.

256
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,070
Speaker 1: A DC villain.

257
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,150
Speaker 0: A DC villain that's even remotely cool.

258
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,813
Speaker 1: DC villains.

259
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,209
Speaker 1: They don't have cool villains in DC so much.

260
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,488
Speaker 0: And yet they've got the Joker, who is almost as good as Magneto.

261
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:17,190
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is just cool because it reminded me of how absolutely goddamn crazy Mark Hamill sounds when he plays the Joker.

262
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,015
Speaker 1: All right, so check this out.

263
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:23,090
Speaker 1: This is a short history of death on the New York City subway.

264
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,090
Speaker 1: So it's basically a whole bunch of stories about ways people died because of the subway and such.

265
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,173
Speaker 1: It's pretty fascinating.

266
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:35,510
Speaker 1: But it's also cool because this design of this web page, this little track that runs all the way down the page.

267
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,469
Speaker 1: And as you scroll, this little train car drives down the web page and it's really cute.

268
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,910
Speaker 1: But it's also rereading stories by people dying.

269
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,730
Speaker 0: Does it talk about the 70s when hobos were pushing people out of the tracks?

270
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, this starts talking about things as old as 1900 when they were drilling the IRT and people were getting killed during the drilling.

271
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:55,853
Speaker 0: Wow.

272
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:56,634
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

273
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:05,390
Speaker 0: New York's structures are powerful both economically and physically in direct proportion to the amount of blood of workers that is integrated into the foundation.

274
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,993
Speaker 1: Here, I'll read that section for you.

275
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:15,930
Speaker 1: When drilling began for the original Interboro Rapid Transit System in 1900, the IRT company recruited miners as skilled laborers useful for their underground experience.

276
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,430
Speaker 1: The miners made $3.50 a day, which in 1900 was a lot actually, and put up with a working environment that held all the terrors of an actual mine.

277
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:30,721
Speaker 1: Rock slides, patches of loose gravel, and sudden encounters with underground ponds like dwarfs.

278
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:37,550
Speaker 1: There was a reported 16 deaths to drill the IRT in 1900.

279
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:47,830
Speaker 1: So when you're riding on a train that's got a number on it, that's an IRT train, if it's underground, just remember that that tunnel you're in, 16 people died so that tunnel could exist.

280
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,530
Speaker 1: And that's only the beginning of this article.

281
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:52,050
Speaker 0: That sounds fascinating.

282
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,088
Speaker 1: About 26 people killed themselves using the train a year.

283
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:57,730
Speaker 0: That's less than I expected.

284
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,230
Speaker 1: But it claims around 200 victims total.

285
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:07,940
Speaker 0: So back to my Joker thing, the top comment says this, "Mark Hamill sounds like a cartoon villain.

286
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:09,944
Speaker 0: Jack Nicholson sounds like a movie villain.

287
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:12,068
Speaker 0: He's ledger sounds like an actually scary

288
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:12,769
Speaker 0: psychopath.".

289
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, because he's not doing something that's unrealistic.

290
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,243
Speaker 0: I think my favorite of this video, my favorite bit, is him in the actual movie where he's basically fake laughing.

291
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:22,704
Speaker 0: He's like, "Ha.

292
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:23,165
Speaker 0: Ha.

293
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:23,586
Speaker 0: Ho.

294
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:23,946
Speaker 0: Hee.

295
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:24,327
Speaker 0: Hoo.

296
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:24,929
Speaker 0: Ha.

297
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:25,390
Speaker 0: Ho.".

298
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:27,990
Speaker 0: Have you even seen that movie?

299
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:36,790
Speaker 0: So in the metamoment, Otacon is this weekend and we are not there after almost a decade of going to Otacon.

300
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,730
Speaker 1: So follow it on Twitter or be there and follow it in person.

301
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:48,770
Speaker 0: Yes, our friend Dave Riley, who you may know from Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, is going to be there doing the same video game journalism academic panel.

302
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,449
Speaker 1: Otacon, why are you doing video game stuff?

303
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,310
Speaker 0: Hey, our biggest panel at Otacon ever in the eight years we did panels at Otacon was Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

304
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:02,550
Speaker 0: But he is there doing the same panel that he ran at Kinetacon and I'm going to try to get him to come to MAGFest and do it there too.

305
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,930
Speaker 1: He's got to go to MAGFest.

306
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,153
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

307
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:08,422
Speaker 0: Dave, Joel, I told you Kinetacon was fun, right?

308
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,230
Speaker 0: You realize there's an audience, you will enjoy MAGFest.

309
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,970
Speaker 0: In fact, all of you will enjoy MAGFest.

310
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,488
Speaker 1: MAGFest is the number one for them.

311
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,290
Speaker 0: But I've got to admit, around noon, you know, because Daryl Surratt's at Otacon, none of our front row crew is there though.

312
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,490
Speaker 0: Like, no one from the old, you know, our crew that would go to Otacon is going this year.

313
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,550
Speaker 1: We're done waiting in line.

314
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:34,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, the rest of the crew bailed on Otacon way before we did and I think PAX actually caused them all to bail on it.

315
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:34,862
Speaker 1: Maybe.

316
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,070
Speaker 0: Because remember, it was that first year all our friends went to PAX East and then none of them went to any anime con after that.

317
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:52,750
Speaker 0: But anyway, around noon, I remembered that for almost a decade of my life, noon on Thursday was when we'd arrive in Baltimore for our weekend of craziness and I got a little nostalgic.

318
00:15:53,411 --> 00:16:02,890
Speaker 0: I have good memories of the Otterbean lobby and I have good memories of not waiting in line because we actually scammed our way out of waiting in that line almost every year we went.

319
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,527
Speaker 1: A few times.

320
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,390
Speaker 0: And I don't think I paid for more than one Otacon.

321
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:14,890
Speaker 0: The last time we skipped the line was because we got tickets to that concert outside of Otacon and they let everyone who had tickets to that skip the line.

322
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,750
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people bought tickets just to skip the line.

323
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,057
Speaker 0: But anyway, Otacon's this weekend.

324
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:23,730
Speaker 0: If you want to get reports, Daryl Surratt is there and he's already put out the Twitter call.

325
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:33,690
Speaker 0: He wants everyone who is there or who's on the internet and cares to find the creepiest missed connections from Otacon on Craigslist and forward them to him.

326
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:34,390
Speaker 1: Okay.

327
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,729
Speaker 0: That is where the truth will be found.

328
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,070
Speaker 1: Go to the Baltimore Craigslist.

329
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:38,591
Speaker 1: Yes.

330
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:46,210
Speaker 0: Also, we will be at PAX Dev doing academia versus reality games, game design, game mechanics, psychology, all that stuff.

331
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:51,170
Speaker 0: And we will be at PAX Prime doing three short mini panels.

332
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,485
Speaker 0: It'll be called short subjects in gaming.

333
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:55,330
Speaker 0: It'll be on Friday.

334
00:16:55,751 --> 00:17:01,610
Speaker 1: And after PAX, I'm probably going to DjangoCon in DC, which means even less geek.

335
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:05,569
Speaker 0: And after PAX, I may be in Warsaw for a week or two.

336
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,269
Speaker 1: Things are getting crazy up in here.

337
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:15,510
Speaker 0: Remember, geek nights always had pseudo hiatus-i around this time between us going outside and us going to places.

338
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,950
Speaker 0: Once winter comes, basically after magfest, it'll be back to normal.

339
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,432
Speaker 1: I don't know.

340
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:24,929
Speaker 1: Historically, it's pretty much spotty the past few years.

341
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,298
Speaker 1: The New York City era.

342
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:28,910
Speaker 1: You'll get an episode once in a while.

343
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're coming.

344
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:30,010
Speaker 0: They're coming.

345
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,050
Speaker 0: But yeah, like I said, I'm flying to Sao Paulo like Tuesday next week, so we'll see how many shows we do.

346
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:41,690
Speaker 1: Oh, and the next book club, obviously not this one, is The Man Who Was Thursday.

347
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,588
Speaker 1: I started reading it.

348
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,229
Speaker 0: It's my choice.

349
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,330
Speaker 1: But it's not because the book is boring, but I start reading it whenever I get in bed, and I just sort of fall asleep immediately because I'm tired.

350
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:52,670
Speaker 1: So I haven't read more than like three pages just because I fell asleep.

351
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:58,330
Speaker 0: But The Man Who Was Thursday, now that we're doing 1Q84, I'm going to talk a little more about it.

352
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,581
Speaker 0: The Man Who Was Thursday is a pretty old book.

353
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,189
Speaker 0: It's from a hundred years ago.

354
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:06,271
Speaker 0: Actually, more than that, 1908.

355
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:12,910
Speaker 0: And it's a thriller set in Edwardian London back when anarchists were a big deal.

356
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:25,170
Speaker 0: And the basic plot is that there's a cop who has to infiltrate the anarchists, and it turns out that he's a better anarchist rabble-rouser pretending to be one than any of the actual anarchists.

357
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:32,969
Speaker 0: And then he starts to discover that maybe other people are running, other anarchist groups are cops like him, and then it just gets crazy from there.

358
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,635
Speaker 1: The cover is pretty awesome.

359
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:38,710
Speaker 1: I got the Penguin book edition just because the cover was so awesome.

360
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,990
Speaker 0: I got the 295 Kindle edition because I don't like having physical media.

361
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,899
Speaker 1: I don't like to pay for a DRM ebook.

362
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:47,150
Speaker 1: I would have pirated it if I was going to get the ebook version.

363
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,410
Speaker 0: But this book is mentioned in Deus Ex, so there's a little bit of a nerdy tie.

364
00:18:51,831 --> 00:19:03,566
Speaker 0: Also, when I mentioned that I was choosing between this and The Great Gatsby, a number of not-Geeknights-listener kids, but adults, mostly fathers, were like, "Yes!

365
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:05,228
Speaker 0: I had to read that in school.

366
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,210
Speaker 0: You should totally do

367
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,290
Speaker 0: it.".

368
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:10,787
Speaker 0: And also one kid who was like, "No, if you do it, my dad's been trying to get me to read this

369
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:11,289
Speaker 0: forever.".

370
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,816
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I'm doing it.

371
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,510
Speaker 0: I started reading it too, and I'm liking it so far.

372
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,166
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Qteen '84.

373
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:19,114
Speaker 0: Alright, 1Q84.

374
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:21,689
Speaker 0: So, again... It was my pick.

375
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,291
Speaker 0: It was.

376
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,075
Speaker 0: This is the Geeknights book club.

377
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:29,507
Speaker 0: Spoilers be warned beyond this line because we're talking about it as though you've already read it.

378
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:30,770
Speaker 0: We're not going to explain the plot.

379
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,477
Speaker 1: So, I chose this book for a few reasons.

380
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:44,030
Speaker 1: Reason number one, Haruki Murakami is uber-famous and pretty much every... A whole bunch of nerdy people, especially anime creators and manga artists, all cited Murakami as a major influence.

381
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:51,590
Speaker 1: Two, he is like the number one best-selling, oh my god, Japanese novelist of late.

382
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,342
Speaker 1: And three, I saw everyone on the subway reading this frickin' book, so I'm like, "Whoa, this keeps showing up everywhere.

383
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,926
Speaker 1: This must be important.

384
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:00,129
Speaker 1: Let's read

385
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:00,189
Speaker 1: it.".

386
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:01,729
Speaker 0: So, we did.

387
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,867
Speaker 0: Yep, and I point out that I read 1Q84 literally knowing nothing about it.

388
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:07,890
Speaker 0: I didn't even read the book jacket.

389
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:08,659
Speaker 0: I knew nothing.

390
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,409
Speaker 0: I opened it to page one and started reading.

391
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,663
Speaker 1: So, it was 900 pages plus until someone told me.

392
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,190
Speaker 1: I just knew what the cover looked like.

393
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,690
Speaker 0: When I started reading it, I still didn't know it was 900 pages because I was reading the Kindle edition.

394
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:28,349
Speaker 1: I looked at the bottom of the percentage area and someone had told me already and I clicked next page and the percentage didn't move and I was like,

395
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:28,510
Speaker 1: "Ah.".

396
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,240
Speaker 0: I did not notice until I got several chapters in.

397
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,103
Speaker 0: I was like, "Wait a minute.

398
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:32,464
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

399
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,512
Speaker 0: 1%?".

400
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,157
Speaker 0: So, I didn't know.

401
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:40,170
Speaker 0: it was about murder with needles or crazy sex.

402
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:40,868
Speaker 0: Or two moons.

403
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:41,809
Speaker 0: Or little people.

404
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,363
Speaker 1: Yeah.

405
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,634
Speaker 0: And the thing is, it didn't matter.

406
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:48,181
Speaker 0: I was drawn in the second.

407
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,230
Speaker 0: that cab driver in the opening scene said his line.

408
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,851
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing.

409
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:55,718
Speaker 1: That first chapter is the only reason.

410
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,330
Speaker 1: If the second chapter was the first chapter, the book would not have happened.

411
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:00,630
Speaker 1: Nope.

412
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:01,092
Speaker 1: Right?

413
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,296
Speaker 1: That first chapter.

414
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:05,085
Speaker 1: And you could see how all the anime creators reciting that.

415
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:05,728
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh my

416
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:06,009
Speaker 1: God.".

417
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,650
Speaker 1: Even though this came, you know, this is pretty recent, right?

418
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,729
Speaker 0: Because you don't know what's going on.

419
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,681
Speaker 1: It's so typical of a thing I see in animes and mangas all the time.

420
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,410
Speaker 1: Somebody, a girl, you know, is in a weird situation.

421
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,619
Speaker 1: She's transferred to another world.

422
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:23,050
Speaker 1: That might as well have been the start of Escablone right there.

423
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,090
Speaker 0: She's in a normal situation and then things take a turn.

424
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:37,970
Speaker 1: And you can already see that even though, you know, all those animes, like the very beginning of the show, there's something normal but there's also something weird.

425
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:43,665
Speaker 1: Then you go to another world where the plot happens and at the end there's the terrible secret of space.

426
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:45,590
Speaker 1: that brings you back around to that stuff at the beginning.

427
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,430
Speaker 0: But I noticed that the weird thing happened, but you don't know it happened until much later.

428
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,190
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it was so blatant right there at the beginning.

429
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,510
Speaker 0: No, because I didn't know it was magical realism or fantasy.

430
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,670
Speaker 1: I didn't either, but as soon as that cab driver says, what did he say?

431
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,974
Speaker 0: Oh, he basically said, "Be careful.

432
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:11,030
Speaker 0: Once you do something like that, once you see the world from a perspective of doing something like that, things can

433
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,210
Speaker 0: change.".

434
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,916
Speaker 1: Yeah.

435
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,110
Speaker 0: Things aren't ever the same again.

436
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,530
Speaker 1: I forget his exact language and I have the Kindle edition so it's hard to bring it up.

437
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:16,691
Speaker 0: I know.

438
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:20,230
Speaker 0: I gotta get those exact words because that is what he said there.

439
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:22,490
Speaker 1: Let me teleport to the beginning of the book here.

440
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:30,310
Speaker 0: Let me try to find it because what he said there is probably my favorite moment in the book and I think it's on my list of favorite lines in books ever.

441
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:31,408
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

442
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:43,650
Speaker 0: Because when I read him saying that, one, the whole time the description of the cab up to that point, the Janicek Symphony, like just all- Dude, I went and I listened to that Janicek Symphony because it's on Spotify.

443
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:45,530
Speaker 1: Oh, it was really good.

444
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:53,149
Speaker 0: I knew Janicek because of my music theory classes at both RIT and high school, but I didn't know that particular sinfonietta.

445
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:05,790
Speaker 0: But the description of that cab and everything, it might sound odd, but it basically reminded me very strongly of the cab driver and the surreal cab scene in Beautiful Dreamer.

446
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:06,265
Speaker 1: Here we go.

447
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,616
Speaker 0: The Ursa Yatsura movie.

448
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:10,070
Speaker 0: Remember when they're in the cab and the cab driver's weird?

449
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,310
Speaker 1: It does have a lot of the Ursa Yatsura weirdness.

450
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:16,350
Speaker 0: But no, not Ursa Yatsura weirdness, Beautiful Dreamer OG weirdness.

451
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,190
Speaker 1: That's what I'm talking about.

452
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,730
Speaker 0: That's like saying Lupin weirdness, but you're talking about Cagliostro.

453
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,241
Speaker 1: I found the thing here.

454
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,707
Speaker 0: Okay, read it.

455
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,730
Speaker 1: I suppose you're right.

456
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:26,410
Speaker 1: Okay, right.

457
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,330
Speaker 1: And after you do something like that, the everyday look of things might seem to change a little.

458
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,770
Speaker 1: Things may look different to you than they did before.

459
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,389
Speaker 1: I've had that experience myself.

460
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,969
Speaker 1: But don't let appearances fool you.

461
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,330
Speaker 1: There's always only one reality.

462
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,908
Speaker 1: When the guy says there's always only one reality, I'm like, oh, snap.

463
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:44,770
Speaker 1: You basically just told me she's going into another world.

464
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,398
Speaker 1: But it's not.

465
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:45,823
Speaker 1: But it is.

466
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:46,370
Speaker 1: But it's not.

467
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:48,168
Speaker 1: And that's exactly what happens.

468
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,130
Speaker 0: And I was like, this is great.

469
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,150
Speaker 0: And then I follow her and I'm not really sure what's going on.

470
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,190
Speaker 0: And then she murders that guy out of nowhere.

471
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:56,334
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:05,930
Speaker 1: It's like, well, you know, because it's that typical thing where it's sort of the, you know, it's funny to bring this up, the concealed Chekhov's gun.

473
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:06,573
Speaker 0: Right.

474
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:06,976
Speaker 1: Where it's?

475
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:09,370
Speaker 1: they keep something hidden from you.

476
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,656
Speaker 1: What is her job?

477
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:13,130
Speaker 1: Where does she have to get to in such a hurry?

478
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,350
Speaker 0: But yet it's portrayed in such a mundane way that you think it's like a business meeting.

479
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:18,115
Speaker 0: Right.

480
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,730
Speaker 1: But I mean, it's that same trick.

481
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,310
Speaker 1: It's like you, you, you let you make it really obvious that you're hiding something.

482
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,150
Speaker 1: It's like you put a curtain right there in the middle of the room and there's something behind it.

483
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,369
Speaker 1: And you're like, you know, there is a curtain here with something hidden behind it.

484
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,649
Speaker 1: And behind it is whatever she's her job is.

485
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,910
Speaker 0: But the thing is, I looked at the curtain.

486
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,910
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, it's some bullshit business meeting.

487
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,390
Speaker 0: I wanted to know why that cab driver said what he said.

488
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,638
Speaker 0: Why?

489
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:45,209
Speaker 1: Why did that?

490
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,410
Speaker 1: You still don't know what the cab driver knows.

491
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,749
Speaker 0: When she saw the cop and she was like, wait a minute, cops don't.

492
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,445
Speaker 1: That was after she went through.

493
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:53,768
Speaker 1: Right.

494
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,394
Speaker 0: Yeah.

495
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,689
Speaker 0: But even then, it was before the murder.

496
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:59,270
Speaker 0: So I see that and I'm like, I'm focused on that and the cab driver.

497
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:03,430
Speaker 0: And as I'm reading, I'm thinking back to that and the cab driver, that and the cab driver.

498
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,769
Speaker 0: And then the needle comes out.

499
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:10,290
Speaker 0: And I had my first Murakami moment, meaning you read a sentence and you stop and go, wait, what?

500
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,250
Speaker 0: And you back up and read the sentence again.

501
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,781
Speaker 0: You're like, oh, really?

502
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:13,881
Speaker 0: Whoa.

503
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,089
Speaker 0: So anyway, that happens like a hundred times in this book.

504
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:19,169
Speaker 1: A zillion times.

505
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,910
Speaker 0: Like you read like way toward the end, even when I was expecting stuff like that.

506
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,556
Speaker 0: I was still like toward the end.

507
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:28,090
Speaker 0: when they're when they're explaining why she has to kill the leader of the cult.

508
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:29,608
Speaker 0: I guess that's in the middle.

509
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,970
Speaker 0: And I'm reading, I'm like, destroyed uterus, like what?

510
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,670
Speaker 1: So anyway, so, you know, you get the story of Aomame and she enters this crazy other world and she's an assassin.

511
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:41,212
Speaker 1: Right.

512
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:44,510
Speaker 1: And then it flips over to Tango's story.

513
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,949
Speaker 0: As soon as I hit Tango, I'm like, I don't care about this.

514
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:48,542
Speaker 0: Well, I cared a lot.

515
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,767
Speaker 1: So here's the thing with Tango.

516
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:50,950
Speaker 1: Right.

517
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,759
Speaker 1: So it does that trick where it's.

518
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,970
Speaker 1: every other chapter is about the two characters.

519
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,348
Speaker 1: It goes back and forth between the two.

520
00:25:56,892 --> 00:26:00,890
Speaker 1: So I'm reading the Tango chapters and it's like, oh, so he's a writer.

521
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,028
Speaker 1: So is that always book within a book?

522
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:05,449
Speaker 0: Straight up, we're going to analyze this book.

523
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:16,110
Speaker 0: 1Q84 is straight up allegory of the relationship between the creator and the created, and that no one can create a work like a creative work, a drawing, a novel, anything in a vacuum.

524
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,570
Speaker 0: Everything they do is influenced by the things around them.

525
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:21,410
Speaker 0: And all those things together are the creator, not any one person.

526
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:21,992
Speaker 1: Yeah.

527
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,865
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the whole thing where they're talking about how.

528
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:26,488
Speaker 1: like, you know, because Tango has to rewrite the book.

529
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:34,289
Speaker 0: And then the indirect conception, what was the phrase for the indirect sex?

530
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,290
Speaker 0: Ambiguous Congress.

531
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,149
Speaker 1: That's right.

532
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,030
Speaker 0: Like he has sex with the one girl, but really he's having sex with the other girl.

533
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:49,910
Speaker 0: And how that is the act of the creation of the new universe and how two people having sex and making a baby is the same as two people collaborating on a work.

534
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,030
Speaker 0: The work is both of them, but yet it's distinct.

535
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,150
Speaker 0: That's the allegory.

536
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:53,693
Speaker 0: Yeah.

537
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:56,310
Speaker 1: It's like Fuka Eri wrote it, but Tango rewrote it.

538
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,696
Speaker 1: So who's the real author?

539
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:03,010
Speaker 1: The both are, but even more than them, you know, the little people are also sort of the author if they exist.

540
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:16,410
Speaker 1: Anyway, so you get this Tango story and I was convinced to like halfway through the book that the Aomame chapters were actually air chrysalis.

541
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:29,850
Speaker 1: And there was, you know, the doubt that that was the case increased, but there was, it was always a reasonable doubt that those Aomame chapters were actually the rewritten air chrysalis.

542
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:44,490
Speaker 1: And I was convinced that they were so because the supernatural weird things like little people and traveling to another world and taxi drivers and such only occurred in the Aomame chapters up until very deep into the book.

543
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:51,188
Speaker 1: And then at some point, the weird, like, you know, I think it was before the cat town, but still pretty close to it.

544
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:56,150
Speaker 0: I found myself using the term cat town to refer to things like that.

545
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:03,170
Speaker 1: It was very late in the book, like almost halfway through, that supernatural things were occurring in the Tango chapters.

546
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:17,270
Speaker 1: And also there were connections between the Aomame chapters and the Tango chapters that confirmed they were in the same world, like encountering the same people or knowing about each other and such and such.

547
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:18,073
Speaker 1: Right.

548
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:29,290
Speaker 1: But it was also it was around the time that, you know, Tango talked about, you know, the the, you know, knowing Aomame from when he was in school and she was like the scary religious.

549
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,769
Speaker 0: I want to back up a little bit because Emily showed me this when we first started reading the book.

550
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,294
Speaker 0: OK.

551
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,250
Speaker 0: And it's Haruki Murakami Bingo.

552
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:41,453
Speaker 0: And then after looking at this, I realized that many of the things like there's well, here.

553
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:42,438
Speaker 0: I'll go through them first.

554
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,350
Speaker 0: Here is Haruki Murakami Bingo.

555
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,256
Speaker 0: Mysterious woman.

556
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:46,598
Speaker 0: Check.

557
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:46,879
Speaker 0: Check.

558
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:48,268
Speaker 0: Ear fetish.

559
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:48,570
Speaker 0: Check.

560
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,750
Speaker 0: So that's the point, because in this book, you know, there were some cute moments with ears related to sex.

561
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:00,350
Speaker 1: And I basically talked a lot about Fukuiri's ears and how they were covered with hair or then she could see them.

562
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,020
Speaker 0: They'd poke out like little Alvin things.

563
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,066
Speaker 0: You just wanted to lick them.

564
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:03,630
Speaker 1: Exactly.

565
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,430
Speaker 0: But I thought that was a nice touch, like it was an interesting like fleshing out of this scene.

566
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:12,649
Speaker 0: But now looking at this bingo and seeing ear fetish as number two on the list.

567
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:14,233
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,170
Speaker 1: And the thing is, pretty much all of these things are in Qteen Eighty-Four.

569
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,869
Speaker 1: I wonder, I haven't read any of other Murakami's books, but based on this bingo card.

570
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,410
Speaker 0: This guy read twelve of them and three short stories and one memoir.

571
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,550
Speaker 0: I have to assume this bingo is legit.

572
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,810
Speaker 1: I have to assume that these items on this bingo are in his other books.

573
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,470
Speaker 1: So I'm going to, you know, I think I'm going to read that Kafka on the Shore next because it's the most famous.

574
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,890
Speaker 0: Emily read that when she said it was weird.

575
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,050
Speaker 1: I'll read it eventually, but I'm pretty sure it's going to have a lot of these bingo card items.

576
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:41,575
Speaker 0: So let's see.

577
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,909
Speaker 0: Dried up well, we didn't have.

578
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,612
Speaker 1: Was there a dried up?

579
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:50,730
Speaker 1: well, maybe in the crazy town that was locked up where the little people were from that Fukari escaped from?

580
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,355
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't remember.

581
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,286
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

582
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:52,570
Speaker 1: Anyway.

583
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,803
Speaker 0: Something vanishing.

584
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:54,006
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,363
Speaker 0: Feeling of being followed.

586
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:56,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the time.

587
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,925
Speaker 0: Unexpected phone call.

588
00:29:59,107 --> 00:29:59,370
Speaker 0: Yes.

589
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,232
Speaker 1: Cats.

590
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:02,850
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, they did the whole thing with the phone and how he could tell.

591
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,204
Speaker 1: He could tell who was calling based on the ring.

592
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:05,990
Speaker 1: What was the guy's name?

593
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:06,715
Speaker 1: The editor?

594
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:08,130
Speaker 1: It's been so long since I read it already.

595
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,653
Speaker 0: Really?

596
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:09,869
Speaker 0: It was Komatsu.

597
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:10,554
Speaker 1: Komatsu.

598
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:13,250
Speaker 1: He could tell when Komatsu was calling because it sounded like his ring.

599
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:13,674
Speaker 1: Yeah.

600
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,210
Speaker 1: Or it was like he'd be like a ring.

601
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:15,716
Speaker 1: But there's no way.

602
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:16,505
Speaker 1: that's Komatsu.

603
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:16,950
Speaker 1: Cats.

604
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:17,554
Speaker 1: Yeah.

605
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:18,850
Speaker 0: Old jazz record.

606
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:19,175
Speaker 1: Yeah.

607
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:19,407
Speaker 1: They would.

608
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:23,650
Speaker 0: His lover is his clearly murdered by her husband.

609
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,275
Speaker 0: Exactly.

610
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:25,850
Speaker 0: I like how you never found out.

611
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,592
Speaker 0: But you can assume.

612
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:33,110
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it was sort of that matched up with the story of our mommy's childhood friend who was killed by her husband.

613
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:33,511
Speaker 0: Yes.

614
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:38,610
Speaker 0: And also our mommy's newer friend who was murdered randomly by strangulation.

615
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:43,090
Speaker 0: And then the girl he met in the cat town had a similar situation in her past.

616
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she wasn't dead.

617
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:47,966
Speaker 0: It didn't matter because she had the vision that she knew.

618
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:48,950
Speaker 0: that's how she was going to die.

619
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:59,230
Speaker 0: The thing is, all those things are like the writer has an experience like that and then uses that element like the core of that idea in a story they write.

620
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,470
Speaker 0: You can see the allegory coming back.

621
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,470
Speaker 1: I also want to point out something just sort of meta.

622
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,071
Speaker 1: Right.

623
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:08,310
Speaker 1: I'm usually pretty bad at remembering stuff and I forgot Komatsu's name.

624
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:13,470
Speaker 1: But look how much I remember from this book, even though I read it, you know, like a month or two ago.

625
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,089
Speaker 1: Usually I would not remember this much.

626
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,650
Speaker 1: I think that is a consequence of a few things.

627
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,728
Speaker 1: Number one, it's really good.

628
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,089
Speaker 1: And number two, the length of it.

629
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,109
Speaker 1: Things are repeated so much.

630
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:24,874
Speaker 1: Right.

631
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,830
Speaker 1: You keep seeing the same things over and over again.

632
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,828
Speaker 1: So you're not going to forget them.

633
00:31:28,273 --> 00:31:30,030
Speaker 1: Even though I forgot to take notes and I probably shouldn't.

634
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,709
Speaker 0: Alright, Scott, what was the first town that Kellis gets to after he gets out of the scary place in the beginning?

635
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:36,110
Speaker 0: First book.

636
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,554
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck.

637
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,610
Speaker 1: I know where it is on the map.

638
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:38,064
Speaker 1: I know.

639
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:43,770
Speaker 1: And they barely even mention that he's there, but he like meets all these people there and then they all die.

640
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:50,130
Speaker 1: He creates the Aldo and Yanni and then they all die in order for him to get to the woodsman guy.

641
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:50,507
Speaker 1: Yup.

642
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,569
Speaker 1: Who is much closer to where they're at.

643
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,106
Speaker 0: Atrathow.

644
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,389
Speaker 1: Atrathow, that's it.

645
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:54,731
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,430
Speaker 0: Anyway, urban ennui.

647
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,477
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

648
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,049
Speaker 0: I mean, urban ennui.

649
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,910
Speaker 0: The picture is someone looking out at the windows that are lighted in the evening from a balcony.

650
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,190
Speaker 1: And looking at a playground.

651
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,710
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the last urban ennui, but there's plenty of other urban ennui.

652
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,226
Speaker 1: Tango sitting in his apartment, bored, going to work.

653
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:14,830
Speaker 0: That poor rubber plant.

654
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,830
Speaker 1: I want to get a rubber plant.

655
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,450
Speaker 1: There's also, what's his name on the stakeout?

656
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,699
Speaker 0: Oh, Ishikawa.

657
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,225
Speaker 0: Uchikawa.

658
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,770
Speaker 0: Uchikawa on the stakeout has got urban ennui.

659
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:31,330
Speaker 1: I mean, pretty much everyone is sitting around in apartments, bored, thinking and talking a whole lot.

660
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,028
Speaker 0: And looking at the other people around them going, "Oh, I wonder how sad their lives

661
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:35,228
Speaker 0: are.".

662
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:36,910
Speaker 0: All right, supernatural powers.

663
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:38,310
Speaker 0: Running.

664
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:38,788
Speaker 0: Check.

665
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,030
Speaker 0: Secret passages.

666
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:41,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, staircase.

667
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:42,569
Speaker 0: Free space.

668
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,990
Speaker 1: And it's a picture of a moon and another moon.

669
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,581
Speaker 1: Another moon.

670
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:48,210
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the two moons.

671
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:48,850
Speaker 0: Let's get there.

672
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:52,330
Speaker 0: You mean how those are allegories for Aomame's breasts?

673
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:52,747
Speaker 1: Yes.

674
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:53,969
Speaker 0: Train station.

675
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:55,290
Speaker 0: Yep.

676
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,070
Speaker 0: They focus on the train stations a lot.

677
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,121
Speaker 0: And he goes to that bar.

678
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,369
Speaker 1: He uses the train to go to the cat town?

679
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:01,770
Speaker 0: You know what was crazy?

680
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,590
Speaker 1: Reading this book.

681
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,710
Speaker 1: Anyhow, you can't miss the last train out of the cat town?

682
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:07,830
Speaker 0: I was in Tokyo for a while with Emily, like two weeks.

683
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,550
Speaker 0: Well, you know, in Japan and Tokyo.

684
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,710
Speaker 0: And actually, the descriptions made a lot more sense because I'd been there.

685
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,530
Speaker 0: Because train stations in Tokyo and around Japan have a particular feel to them.

686
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,689
Speaker 0: And this book captured that.

687
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:23,549
Speaker 0: To a ridiculous degree.

688
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:24,788
Speaker 1: I know that feel, bro.

689
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,010
Speaker 0: Historical flashbacks?

690
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:27,810
Speaker 0: We did get that.

691
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,690
Speaker 0: Remember the student protests and the whole Professor Ebisu thing?

692
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:32,269
Speaker 1: I guess that sort of counts.

693
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,169
Speaker 0: Because you get the historical flashback of...

694
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,187
Speaker 1: It's a fake history, but it is sort of a...

695
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:37,989
Speaker 0: No, but it's tied to a real history.

696
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:38,342
Speaker 0: It is.

697
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,030
Speaker 0: A precocious teenager.

698
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,048
Speaker 1: I don't know.

699
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,389
Speaker 1: Is Fukari precocious?

700
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:44,505
Speaker 1: It depends on, you know...

701
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:46,510
Speaker 0: I liked her as a character a lot.

702
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:46,883
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

703
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,307
Speaker 1: I mean, she was pretty much, you know, that sort of Aomame Rei situation.

704
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:55,648
Speaker 1: Like, as soon as she showed up, I'm like, "Oh, that's the magical girl who's the powerful

705
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:55,869
Speaker 1: one."

706
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,149
Speaker 1: Like Nadia or, you know, Nausicaa or whoever you want it to be.

707
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:01,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, lots of cooking.

708
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,229
Speaker 0: Speaking to cats?

709
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:03,609
Speaker 1: Did he speak?

710
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,889
Speaker 1: Did anyone speak to a cat?

711
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:06,369
Speaker 0: The cat town, the cats talk to him.

712
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:07,350
Speaker 1: Oh, that's true.

713
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,408
Speaker 1: But no one was actually talking to cat cats.

714
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,289
Speaker 0: The owl talked to him instead.

715
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,047
Speaker 0: Parallel worlds.

716
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what the book's about.

717
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,726
Speaker 0: Weird sex.

718
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:17,379
Speaker 1: Yep.

719
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,728
Speaker 0: Chip kid cover.

720
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:19,509
Speaker 1: Yep.

721
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,085
Speaker 0: Tokyo at night.

722
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,449
Speaker 0: Unusual name, and it has a name tag.

723
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,428
Speaker 0: This is Aomame.

724
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,570
Speaker 0: And the only last two, faceless villain we didn't really get.

725
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,870
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we kind of saw the little people.

726
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could stretch and say that they were faceless villains.

727
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,168
Speaker 0: And vanishing cats, which we didn't get.

728
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,889
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's any vanishing cats.

729
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,850
Speaker 1: Someone might, you know... So precocious means unusually advanced or mature in development.

730
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,710
Speaker 1: Especially mental development.

731
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:53,250
Speaker 1: So yes, Fuka Eri is incredibly precocious because she's way smarter mentally than her age, even though she's not socially developed.

732
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:56,330
Speaker 1: And she's also physically developed well beyond her age.

733
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,748
Speaker 1: And they mention that often.

734
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,830
Speaker 1: Like, you know, whoa, she's got like a woman's body, even though she's like a teenager.

735
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:06,750
Speaker 0: So we win this bingo like 11 times over.

736
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:11,989
Speaker 0: You wanted to talk about breasts.

737
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,170
Speaker 1: Right, so, you know, they talk about, you know, the two moons, right?

738
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,890
Speaker 1: And you only see the two moons if you're sort of in the other world, right?

739
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,750
Speaker 1: And that's how you know.

740
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,490
Speaker 1: But only certain people see the two moons.

741
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:22,989
Speaker 1: But they're always afraid to ask.

742
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,230
Speaker 1: And they never ask anyone about the two moons, right?

743
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,049
Speaker 1: No one ever asks.

744
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,470
Speaker 0: And everyone thinks, "Should I ask?

745
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,429
Speaker 0: No, that'd be crazy.

746
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:36,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, are these other people in this world, you know, like, you know, the dowager, for example, does she see the two moons?

747
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,809
Speaker 1: And that would confirm that they are all in another world.

748
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:44,648
Speaker 0: Well, obviously it's all allegory that people don't pay attention to the greater existential world around them.

749
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,309
Speaker 0: And it's possible that everyone notices them but doesn't think about it.

750
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,139
Speaker 0: But we know that's not true.

751
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:52,930
Speaker 0: because look at the meta plot.

752
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:58,929
Speaker 0: The book that they wrote inoculated people against the little people because it described these things.

753
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,090
Speaker 0: It's zebra storyteller.

754
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,790
Speaker 1: Oh, you're bringing your zebra storyteller into it?

755
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,989
Speaker 0: Because it's literal here.

756
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,230
Speaker 0: That book was a literal zebra storyteller that prevented the little people from doing their bullshit.

757
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, the little people were very upset that the book was being distributed talking about them, you know?

758
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,028
Speaker 1: So it very well could be what you what you say.

759
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:26,247
Speaker 1: But anyway, you had the two moons and one was smaller than the other, you know, but they it's like one, you know, and then you also had the with the air chrysalis, you know, the maza and the dota.

760
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, maza and dota.

761
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,290
Speaker 1: It's like really you could have done better than that.

762
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,250
Speaker 1: But I guess in Japanese, if you don't know English, that maybe works.

763
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:33,766
Speaker 1: I don't know.

764
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,810
Speaker 1: It didn't work very well as an English reader.

765
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,730
Speaker 0: Well, I was like maza and I was like, what?

766
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:38,370
Speaker 0: OK, cool.

767
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,547
Speaker 0: Then like dota.

768
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:41,769
Speaker 1: And I'm like defense of the ancients, what?

769
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:46,770
Speaker 1: But yeah, she had the maza and the dota with the air chrysalis.

770
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:55,670
Speaker 1: And then you have our mom constantly, you know, going back to the fact that, you know, she doesn't like her boobs and one is different than the other.

771
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:59,050
Speaker 1: So you get the boobs, the moon, the maza and the dota.

772
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:05,450
Speaker 1: It's that same repeating thing of there is a main thing and there is a second smaller offspring.

773
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:06,170
Speaker 1: Right.

774
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,570
Speaker 1: The offspring, the creation of the thing that ties back to the writing of the book.

775
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:11,390
Speaker 1: Right.

776
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,950
Speaker 1: It's it's that same thing repeated over and over again.

777
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,549
Speaker 1: The same imagery in different forms all over the place.

778
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,750
Speaker 0: Now, I want to take an aside.

779
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:27,050
Speaker 0: You know, it flipped back and forth between two characters pretty much the entire time until we got Ushikawa.

780
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:27,739
Speaker 1: Yep.

781
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:33,628
Speaker 1: That was so weird because he's like this side character who when you first introduce him, you hate him.

782
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,990
Speaker 1: Oh, he's like the worst guy.

783
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:36,450
Speaker 0: Like this is the sleaziest.

784
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:36,700
Speaker 1: Yeah.

785
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:48,190
Speaker 1: You're like finally there's a bad guy with a name that we can see who's actually doing stuff and not sort of like this mysterious little people or, you know, the mysterious leader or any of those kind of groups.

786
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:48,470
Speaker 1: Right.

787
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,989
Speaker 1: There is a bad guy with a name and he's right there in front of you.

788
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:56,030
Speaker 1: And he's portrayed as like the most disgusting person.

789
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:56,910
Speaker 1: You don't want to be near him.

790
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,209
Speaker 1: You don't want to talk to me or look at him.

791
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,450
Speaker 1: Like I really felt like he was a slimy otaku fan boy, even though he wasn't a nerd.

792
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,430
Speaker 1: But you know, that kind of personality.

793
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,168
Speaker 0: I pictured someone we won't name from RIT.

794
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

795
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,069
Speaker 0: In fact, I pictured him looking exactly like that guy.

796
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,430
Speaker 1: I figured him having like a little slightly longer, greasier, nasty hair.

797
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:14,808
Speaker 1: Yeah.

798
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,302
Speaker 0: Anyway.

799
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:21,268
Speaker 0: But then we got him his perspective and he basically became a main character up until he was killed.

800
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,027
Speaker 1: It's like book three.

801
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,669
Speaker 1: It's like chapter one, Ushikawa.

802
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,108
Speaker 1: I'm like wah wah wah.

803
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:25,646
Speaker 0: Yeah.

804
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,990
Speaker 0: Again, the Murakami backs like double take.

805
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:29,470
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:42,770
Speaker 1: And he's portrayed in a way that is, you know, he's still a disgusting bad person, but it's like suddenly they tell, he gives you all this information about him and shows you the side of him that you don't completely hate him.

807
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,390
Speaker 1: You can sort of empathize with this aspect of him in a weird way.

808
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,150
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, you made me hate this guy.

809
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,869
Speaker 1: And now you make me like part of this guy.

810
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:50,568
Speaker 1: Why you do this?

811
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,268
Speaker 0: It's got to remember.

812
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:51,837
Speaker 0: Borado.

813
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,094
Speaker 1: Yeah.

814
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:54,870
Speaker 1: Right.

815
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:00,450
Speaker 0: But I really like Ushikawa as a character, as a person, still don't like him that much.

816
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:07,228
Speaker 0: But again, I like the fact that they really make a point about how he was ugly and this was basically the only thing he could do.

817
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,228
Speaker 0: And how he did it well.

818
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,750
Speaker 0: But he was not a professional.

819
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:19,410
Speaker 0: And that whole plot about Tamaru was a professional in the master Keaton sense.

820
00:39:19,697 --> 00:39:20,006
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

821
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,410
Speaker 0: And I really like that.

822
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,849
Speaker 1: Tamaru is definitely like the king Cosmo of the book, that character that's just, oh, he's the awesomest dude.

823
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,610
Speaker 0: But at the same time, he's a professional.

824
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,250
Speaker 0: You feel bad for him in the sense that he is a master Keaton professional.

825
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,730
Speaker 0: That is, that is his life.

826
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:35,730
Speaker 0: He has nothing else.

827
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,710
Speaker 1: He's definitely not the happiest character, but he's just the most badass character.

828
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:46,229
Speaker 0: Well, the fact that he pulls Astro Boy Batman, as in when Aomame calls him, he's like, yeah, I found the guy who's spying on us.

829
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:52,429
Speaker 0: He fucking murders the guy like straight away, just like bam, and he murders him in a super professional way.

830
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:55,450
Speaker 0: But yet he feels like detached and a little bad about it.

831
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,330
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, sorry, I got to kill you, but that's how it goes.

832
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,148
Speaker 1: That's how it goes.

833
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:06,808
Speaker 0: It's also cool that like, oh, when he calls Sakagaki and he's like, you should come and pick up your package.

834
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:08,465
Speaker 0: I left it here.

835
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, doors unlocked.

836
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,910
Speaker 1: Well, and then, you know, he's he's shown in contrast to a tall guy and ponytail.

837
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,715
Speaker 1: And yep.

838
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:16,930
Speaker 1: Who were the other guy?

839
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:24,456
Speaker 0: Ponytail and and buzz cut buzz for dangerous and smart and, you know, masters, but not professional.

840
00:40:24,476 --> 00:40:25,430
Speaker 0: They were not professionals.

841
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,650
Speaker 1: I don't know if they were masters either.

842
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,696
Speaker 0: They were just well, they were.

843
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:29,810
Speaker 0: no, they were masters, but they were not masters of life.

844
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:38,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder they were more like Bebop and Rocksteady, but I've seen a lot of Japanese works that have this idea of.

845
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,769
Speaker 0: there are skilled people and then there are professionals.

846
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:51,890
Speaker 0: and there are these stereotypes of the, quote, professional like when that term like the sushi master, the sword master, you know, the what's the guy from Killville.

847
00:40:52,250 --> 00:41:01,829
Speaker 0: But so once you wait for and master Keaton, both Hattori Hanzo, that professional character as being also a little sad.

848
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:09,290
Speaker 0: And I got to find out what the actual Japanese word that was used in both of those and see if this is a trope of Japanese stuff.

849
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,710
Speaker 0: I almost want to see if I can turn that into a panel.

850
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,654
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the thing, right?

851
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:16,093
Speaker 1: It's like we've watched so much anime and read so much mangas, right?

852
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,790
Speaker 1: I haven't read that many Japanese novels, even translated ones.

853
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,330
Speaker 1: Maybe this is might even be the first one novel I've read by a Japanese author.

854
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,770
Speaker 1: Maybe I've read a light novel or visual or something.

855
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,131
Speaker 1: I don't know.

856
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:32,548
Speaker 1: But it's like you see, oh, it's, you know, this really.

857
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,168
Speaker 1: I've seen Japanese live action movies, too.

858
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,330
Speaker 1: And you see these tropes.

859
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:40,170
Speaker 1: And now I begin to see those the things that I liked in anime.

860
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,770
Speaker 1: A lot of those weren't necessarily things from anime.

861
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:50,115
Speaker 1: They were, you know, there were things that are common to Japanese fiction, you know, across the board.

862
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:54,087
Speaker 1: And that's why you get so much of the influence going in all the different directions.

863
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:06,650
Speaker 1: So I really now my question is, like, what is it about Japanese society and Japanese culture that has put these tropes into Japanese fiction works across all mediums?

864
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,930
Speaker 1: Why are there so many stories about traveling to another world?

865
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:14,110
Speaker 1: Why are there so many stories about, you know, some weird supernatural thing?

866
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,510
Speaker 1: You know, why is there always some magical, mysterious, quiet girl?

867
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,212
Speaker 1: Why is there?

868
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:24,830
Speaker 1: you know, what is it about the Japanese people and their society that makes them really like stories like this?

869
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,710
Speaker 1: And why do I always like stories like that, even though I'm not from Japan?

870
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,001
Speaker 1: You know, these are questions I don't have answers to.

871
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,450
Speaker 1: that would require some research.

872
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,850
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, Tamaru gets mad points because he and, you know, the Chekhov's gun.

873
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:43,116
Speaker 0: I like how they when Aoname asked for the gun, he gets it to her and he's like, it's Chekhov's gun.

874
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:44,590
Speaker 0: If I give you this is going to be fired.

875
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,890
Speaker 0: Oh, I love how meta that is.

876
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:53,088
Speaker 0: I love how it was never actually fired and how there was a forward flash to events that don't actually take place.

877
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:53,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

878
00:42:53,951 --> 00:43:01,609
Speaker 0: Like when there was that forward flash to her being held by Sakagaki and like, like being forced to give birth to the baby and all those things.

879
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,190
Speaker 0: I basically expected that to happen.

880
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:08,995
Speaker 0: And I was like, like when she went out to trail Ushikau, I was like, fuck, this is when she's going to get kidnapped.

881
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,428
Speaker 0: And then when Tamaru just fucking kills him and they get away, I was like, what?

882
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:21,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fact that Chekhov's gun and Chekhov's like foreshadowing were both wrong and yet were pointed at.

883
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,510
Speaker 0: I feel like every time this novel pointed me at something, it wasn't going to happen.

884
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:33,690
Speaker 1: Well, it's weird because in a way that Chekhov's gun right was and what was fired and was not fired at the same time.

885
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:33,992
Speaker 1: Right.

886
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:35,823
Speaker 1: Because, you know, a gun appears.

887
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:37,732
Speaker 1: Right.

888
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:42,050
Speaker 1: And he says in the book, a character says, you know, Chekhov, right?

889
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,910
Speaker 1: He Chekhov said when a gun is in a story, it has to be fired.

890
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,990
Speaker 0: But Aoname in the end, she basically said not all stories have to follow conventions.

891
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,572
Speaker 1: Exactly.

892
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:56,631
Speaker 1: So in a way, the the item, the physical item of the gun was not the Chekhov's gun.

893
00:43:56,691 --> 00:44:03,070
Speaker 1: The Chekhov's gun was the meta of the characters saying Chekhov's gun.

894
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,650
Speaker 1: So in a way, the gun not being fired was the Chekhov's gun.

895
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:13,710
Speaker 1: And having it an end without being fired was it being fired.

896
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,149
Speaker 1: They fired the non firing gun.

897
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:19,209
Speaker 1: When the book ended and it wasn't used.

898
00:44:19,714 --> 00:44:21,368
Speaker 0: I also like to at the end, they escape.

899
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,716
Speaker 0: I like how she tried to escape by just walking, you know, doing the same thing you did before.

900
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:26,570
Speaker 1: Well, OK, so.

901
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,189
Speaker 0: And then later she's like, duh.

902
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,012
Speaker 0: Right.

903
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,329
Speaker 1: Well, when she went down the first time.

904
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,074
Speaker 1: Right.

905
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:34,829
Speaker 1: She tried to go down and it didn't work.

906
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:41,409
Speaker 1: I immediately I was already thinking like 10 pages before that when she started thinking about the staircase, I was like, yeah, go up.

907
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:44,529
Speaker 1: And then when she went down, I was like, why didn't you go up?

908
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:45,654
Speaker 0: I expect.

909
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:48,006
Speaker 1: And then when later she went to go up, I was like, snap.

910
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:51,790
Speaker 0: I expected them to get into that same cab.

911
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,269
Speaker 1: I was I was looking for the cab, too.

912
00:44:54,891 --> 00:45:04,090
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh, let the cab be at the top of the staircase, especially if the cab driver, when they got into the car, was just like, I figured you'd be back.

913
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:04,797
Speaker 0: Yeah.

914
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:05,489
Speaker 0: Or something like that.

915
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:13,912
Speaker 1: Remember, there was also these other cars on the road, like the old lady in the car, like the old rich lady in the limo or whatever, or driving the, I guess, Benz or something.

916
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:20,970
Speaker 1: And I was trying to make a connection between that old lady driving the car on the highway and the Dowager from the other world.

917
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,535
Speaker 1: And I couldn't really.

918
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,930
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, there wasn't really much to go on there.

919
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:35,690
Speaker 1: But it's like when they started talking about that old lady driving on the highway, I thought of the Dowager, but I couldn't really find any specific thing that says, you know, that puts them together.

920
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,627
Speaker 0: But I liked how when she they escaped and they're on the highway in the new world again, and then she looks at the S.O.

921
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,250
Speaker 0: Tiger and she's like, oh, he's reversed.

922
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,008
Speaker 0: We're in yet another different world.

923
00:45:46,391 --> 00:45:49,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there are a lot of ideas in this book that you can't go back.

924
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,870
Speaker 0: Well, you can't set things back.

925
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,450
Speaker 0: Of course they were ever.

926
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,597
Speaker 0: You're always moving forward.

927
00:45:54,657 --> 00:45:56,489
Speaker 0: Everything you do changes reality around you.

928
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,110
Speaker 0: And it was that was just kind of ever present.

929
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,929
Speaker 0: It wasn't the core of the book, but it was there.

930
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,570
Speaker 0: And I'm glad that that continued.

931
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:03,151
Speaker 0: Yep.

932
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:11,894
Speaker 0: Granted, all I thought of was that episode of The Simpsons where Homer goes back in time and keeps fucking up the future and eventually he finds the world that's close enough places.

933
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:15,029
Speaker 1: Things may look different to you like the S.O.

934
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,046
Speaker 1: Tiger being backwards.

935
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:16,310
Speaker 1: Right.

936
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's only one day before I've had that experience myself.

937
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:23,350
Speaker 1: So the cab driver has seen this happen.

938
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,770
Speaker 1: But don't let appearances fool you.

939
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,874
Speaker 1: There's only one reality.

940
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:32,310
Speaker 1: And when he says only one reality, I wonder, is he saying that there's only one reality?

941
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:38,989
Speaker 1: And when you think you're changing realities, you're really just seeing the world from a new perspective because of the things that have happened to you.

942
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,115
Speaker 0: That's one way to look at it.

943
00:46:40,155 --> 00:46:42,730
Speaker 0: Here are these things that some people might think.

944
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,693
Speaker 0: Yes.

945
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:52,190
Speaker 1: Or the way I was seeing it is that there is one reality that contains these different universes and you're traveling between them.

946
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,824
Speaker 1: So even though it's like that other universe you were in still exists.

947
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:59,009
Speaker 1: right in this same reality, you were there.

948
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:02,592
Speaker 1: Now you are here in a different in QT and 84.

949
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:02,854
Speaker 1: Right.

950
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,569
Speaker 1: But you can't go back.

951
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:06,490
Speaker 1: It's a one way street to go to the next.

952
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:08,770
Speaker 0: That means that the other reality might as well not exist.

953
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:10,270
Speaker 0: So there still is only one reality.

954
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:10,693
Speaker 1: Right.

955
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:13,070
Speaker 1: But it does still exist somewhere.

956
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:16,109
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if it exists, though, if you can't interact with it.

957
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:16,954
Speaker 1: Yeah.

958
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:20,331
Speaker 0: That's just, you know, you know what, you know, where it exists in your memory and nothing more.

959
00:47:20,372 --> 00:47:25,312
Speaker 0: The only way you even know that there was another one because things look different.

960
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:25,453
Speaker 1: Yes.

961
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:28,230
Speaker 1: You remember there's a backwards thing.

962
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:28,493
Speaker 1: Right.

963
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,650
Speaker 1: And how do you even know your memory?

964
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,891
Speaker 1: Right.

965
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:33,493
Speaker 1: It's not like, well, they took a picture of the two moons and brought it with them.

966
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:34,950
Speaker 0: Well, and two brilliant things.

967
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,473
Speaker 0: One, this was set in 1984.

968
00:47:37,473 --> 00:47:39,988
Speaker 0: So there weren't smartphones and Internet to just have.

969
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:40,289
Speaker 1: that was.

970
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is a very clear.

971
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:47,690
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that, because, you know, the level of technology that's going on in 1984 is pretty much perfect.

972
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:48,414
Speaker 1: Right.

973
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,530
Speaker 1: It's like you don't have the advanced technology.

974
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:59,770
Speaker 1: So there's not a lot of plot holes because basically advanced technology, even modern technology, which is highly advanced, is like superpowers.

975
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:04,830
Speaker 1: We can travel around the world so fast we can communicate with anyone anywhere.

976
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,096
Speaker 0: Dude, I got it so easily.

977
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:12,910
Speaker 0: I got a direct flight not that long ago from an airport that's really close to my house to Istanbul.

978
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:18,936
Speaker 1: It was a nine stop nine hour 19 before they had planes, but it wasn't, you know, like it is today.

979
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was.

980
00:48:20,204 --> 00:48:21,050
Speaker 1: there were less flight.

981
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,810
Speaker 0: You'd have to go home and call someone on the phone.

982
00:48:23,294 --> 00:48:23,900
Speaker 0: All the description.

983
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:24,810
Speaker 1: How do you get the plane ticket?

984
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:25,915
Speaker 1: You just buy them on the Internet.

985
00:48:26,297 --> 00:48:32,992
Speaker 0: All the descriptions of Uchikawa having a film camera and getting his pictures developed and having the rapid fire shutter and everything.

986
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:33,495
Speaker 0: Yep.

987
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:41,310
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it wasn't so old fashioned like a Hitchcock movie, you know, where you're like stranded.

988
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:43,889
Speaker 1: It's like the characters could do things.

989
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:44,632
Speaker 1: And it was.

990
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:51,029
Speaker 1: it was exactly right for this story to where you wouldn't have like these superpower loopholes, like, why didn't Superman just do this?

991
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:58,970
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you weren't so limited that it was boring, like, oh, he just said it in like 1910, you know, before there were cars.

992
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:01,650
Speaker 1: So they had to have a foot race and he get caught.

993
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,890
Speaker 0: And I liked how mommy, when she saw the moon, she's like, was it always that way?

994
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,740
Speaker 0: Am I just crazy?

995
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:05,841
Speaker 0: Yeah.

996
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:10,553
Speaker 0: Which is a very and then she's like, no, if I even consider that I'm crazy, then I'm probably not.

997
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:19,330
Speaker 0: But that moment where Tango is looking up at the moon and Uchikawa was watching him and Uchikawa was like, what the fuck is he doing?

998
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:29,452
Speaker 0: And then Uchikawa looks up and sees the two moons like, oh, like that moment where he shows that he was a person who had never looked up.

999
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:32,250
Speaker 0: Almost everyone in the world had never looked up.

1000
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,070
Speaker 0: Looking up is clearly a metaphor.

1001
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:38,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, but but it's you know, but it's it's just, you know, it's an aspect of him.

1002
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:47,110
Speaker 1: that's like, you know, what happens when a person who is probably, you know, sure, no, hardly anyone has looked up, but the person who has really never looked up as Uchikawa.

1003
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:47,672
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1004
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:56,230
Speaker 1: So when a person who has never looked up, the person farthest from the up lookers looks up, it's like, look what happened there.

1005
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:56,935
Speaker 1: Right.

1006
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:58,450
Speaker 1: Just totally blown away.

1007
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:02,432
Speaker 0: So let's get back to a little bit what the cab driver said, because we both experienced this.

1008
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:04,690
Speaker 0: How many didn't we just talked about it?

1009
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,489
Speaker 0: How many years did we go to Otacon and love it?

1010
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:16,929
Speaker 0: And we were like panelists, but joining the staff, working the artist alley, going to PAX as a guest speaker instead of an attendee.

1011
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:25,230
Speaker 0: Once you see conventions from those perspectives, if you go to a normal convention as an attendee again, everything you see, everything completely differently.

1012
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:25,833
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1013
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:28,990
Speaker 0: I mean, you can never see it any other way again.

1014
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,316
Speaker 1: I really think that was like.

1015
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:42,910
Speaker 1: the part of the book I enjoyed more than anything else is even though he's describing these supernatural experiences that would never happen to any real person, somehow they relate to things that really happened to me, at least in my real life.

1016
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,110
Speaker 1: Well, that can be something in a different way.

1017
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:47,590
Speaker 1: And now I can't see it the old way ever again.

1018
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:52,410
Speaker 0: That I had some sort of just had he went to an anime con and then he helped run it.

1019
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:58,310
Speaker 1: I had some sort of surreal experience that might as well have been little people, but it wasn't actually little people.

1020
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,256
Speaker 1: It was just dream.

1021
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:01,090
Speaker 0: I like how they were actually Asian.

1022
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:04,770
Speaker 0: I really liked how they were actually literally just little people.

1023
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was kind of weird.

1024
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:07,233
Speaker 1: Right.

1025
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:15,250
Speaker 1: You know, the air chrysalis where, you know, you work hard on creating something, you know, with with, you know, your hard work night after night.

1026
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:22,310
Speaker 1: And then when it forms, you know, not only have you created a new thing, but now you're also seeing things differently and you're a new person.

1027
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:29,490
Speaker 1: You know, it's it's like, oh, you know, every one of those things, even though I did not literally make an air chrysalis or whatever.

1028
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:30,312
Speaker 1: Right.

1029
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:36,529
Speaker 1: I'm sure all of you listening as well, you have done all the things that have happened in this book, you know, including not shoot someone.

1030
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:38,630
Speaker 1: Right.

1031
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:43,269
Speaker 1: You know, being paranoid about people watching you, you know, all this stuff.

1032
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,810
Speaker 0: You know, I haven't said I really like this book.

1033
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:47,557
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

1034
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:48,549
Speaker 1: You don't say.

1035
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,787
Speaker 0: I really, really enjoyed it.

1036
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1037
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:54,090
Speaker 1: Scott, picking the books that people enjoy.

1038
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:54,962
Speaker 1: That was a good book.

1039
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:55,409
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1040
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:57,179
Speaker 1: Do you want to say anything else?

1041
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:58,590
Speaker 1: Oh, I do want to say one thing.

1042
00:51:58,871 --> 00:51:59,542
Speaker 1: Right.

1043
00:51:59,725 --> 00:51:59,949
Speaker 1: In this.

1044
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,410
Speaker 0: OK, because I have one like big thing I want to say.

1045
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,639
Speaker 0: It's the only thing I dislike.

1046
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,910
Speaker 1: Mine's meta so you can go.

1047
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:12,490
Speaker 0: OK, so the one thing that pissed me off is that the plot to kill the leader of Sakigake was bullshit.

1048
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,209
Speaker 0: That was a stupid plot.

1049
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,649
Speaker 1: Wasn't the dumbest plot.

1050
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:17,156
Speaker 0: No, no.

1051
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:18,129
Speaker 0: Here's why it was dumb.

1052
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:32,709
Speaker 0: The whole point of her killing him, as opposed to someone else or some other way, was that she can kill people in a way to where no autopsy can possibly figure it out, that it appears to be a natural death.

1053
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:42,310
Speaker 0: Had she not disappeared and emptied her apartment and made it obvious that she had killed him, there is no way they would have known.

1054
00:52:42,672 --> 00:52:47,176
Speaker 0: And she was a public enough figure because of her work where they couldn't have just disappeared her.

1055
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,270
Speaker 0: That's sort of true.

1056
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:53,670
Speaker 0: Unlike Komatsu, who was such a recluse, it was trivial to disappear him.

1057
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:54,814
Speaker 1: That's sort of true.

1058
00:52:54,855 --> 00:53:03,605
Speaker 1: But at the same time, right, if you're the last person to see a dead person and you killed the leader of a crazy cult, they're probably going to come after you anyway.

1059
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:08,006
Speaker 1: So your best bet is to run away and hide, even if it gives you away.

1060
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:14,947
Speaker 0: She had blackmail on them in that she knew the leader was dead.

1061
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:15,649
Speaker 0: if they go to her.

1062
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:17,528
Speaker 1: That crazy storm is here.

1063
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,173
Speaker 0: That's meta.

1064
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:22,270
Speaker 0: We're watching a crazy thunderstorm roll over New York City.

1065
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,568
Speaker 0: We've been waiting for this all day.

1066
00:53:25,251 --> 00:53:30,910
Speaker 1: OK, so the meta I want to talk about is in the back of this edition I have on my Kindle that I illegally acquired.

1067
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,510
Speaker 1: There's questions for discussion.

1068
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:34,508
Speaker 0: I had that, too.

1069
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,110
Speaker 1: And some of these are the lamest book club questions.

1070
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:38,772
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1071
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,256
Speaker 0: I looked at that.

1072
00:53:39,297 --> 00:53:40,810
Speaker 0: I was like, what is this third grade?

1073
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,930
Speaker 1: I was like, when I saw that, I was like, OK, I saw it said questions for discussion.

1074
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:49,207
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, there's a chance that these a very small chance.

1075
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:49,950
Speaker 1: these could be good.

1076
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,630
Speaker 1: And maybe we'll use them on the book club episode.

1077
00:53:52,211 --> 00:53:55,629
Speaker 1: They're pretty much universally bad book club questions like the first one.

1078
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,110
Speaker 1: 1Q84 is a vast and intricate novel.

1079
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:02,589
Speaker 1: What are the pleasures of reading such a long work of staying with the same characters over such a long period of time?

1080
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:03,373
Speaker 1: Really?

1081
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:05,190
Speaker 1: That's that's your book club question.

1082
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,210
Speaker 1: These are questions for the old lady Barnes and Noble book club.

1083
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,244
Speaker 0: You know, so a few people.

1084
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:13,570
Speaker 0: I was reading some reviews of it.

1085
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,330
Speaker 0: There were a few like literary people, most pretty much everyone.

1086
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,509
Speaker 0: The critical reviews of this were just like, this is the best book.

1087
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:21,509
Speaker 0: But some people hated it.

1088
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:32,333
Speaker 0: And pretty much the people who hated it all said that it was tone deaf, dialog, unyielding plot that goes nowhere, lazy and cliched, and that the little people were not menacing.

1089
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,310
Speaker 1: That last one, little people are supposed to be men.

1090
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,509
Speaker 0: Those little people were menacing as well.

1091
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:43,857
Speaker 1: The thing is, on the one hand, they weren't supposed to be directly menacing, like you think they're going to come out and kill.

1092
00:54:43,877 --> 00:54:53,170
Speaker 0: you read when you get the actual story of air chrysalis of her sitting there with the little people and they're making the thing and ho ho, said the keeper of the beat.

1093
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:57,750
Speaker 0: They just oozed something bad about to happen.

1094
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:58,332
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1095
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:00,070
Speaker 1: It's like, what the hell are they up to?

1096
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,470
Speaker 1: And it's like everyone was always, always on their guard.

1097
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,330
Speaker 1: Like you don't want to upset the little people.

1098
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:06,076
Speaker 1: You know why?

1099
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:07,630
Speaker 1: It's like the eye of Sauron.

1100
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,498
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, is it?

1101
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:11,446
Speaker 1: can it really do anything directly besides?

1102
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:12,129
Speaker 1: look at you?

1103
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:13,254
Speaker 1: Not so much.

1104
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:16,833
Speaker 1: But if it sees you, the Nazgul will come and I do not want his baleful gaze upon.

1105
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:17,195
Speaker 1: Right.

1106
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:20,755
Speaker 1: So but it's like the little people, it's like you didn't want them to see you.

1107
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:22,006
Speaker 1: They were up to something.

1108
00:55:22,046 --> 00:55:22,450
Speaker 1: no good.

1109
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,334
Speaker 1: They were mysterious.

1110
00:55:23,374 --> 00:55:30,970
Speaker 1: You couldn't reach them, but it felt like they could always reach you, you know, and especially since the way they behaved was so creepy.

1111
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:36,830
Speaker 1: It's it's like, you know, one of those aliens or horror movies where just there's an alien doing weird stuff.

1112
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:42,739
Speaker 1: He's not directly attacking or biting or shooting or, you know, whatever, but they're doing weird stuff.

1113
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:43,889
Speaker 1: What the hell are they up to?

1114
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:44,712
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1115
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:49,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, not not would not want to have some little people hanging out.

1116
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:58,168
Speaker 1: And it was also menacing because once, you know, like the little people that crawl out of someone's body any time, like someone was going to sleep, I was like, oh, my God, little people are going to come out.

1117
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:01,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, they exploded that day in the room and see the little people come out.

1118
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:03,928
Speaker 0: When they exploded that dog.

1119
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:05,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

1120
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,030
Speaker 0: That was crazy.

1121
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:06,692
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1122
00:56:06,712 --> 00:56:09,550
Speaker 1: Anyone who explodes a dog from the inside is menacing.

1123
00:56:09,731 --> 00:56:11,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was expecting a person to explode after that.

1124
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:12,575
Speaker 1: I know.

1125
00:56:12,657 --> 00:56:12,860
Speaker 1: Right.

1126
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:13,329
Speaker 1: Never happened.

1127
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,097
Speaker 1: I was worried.

1128
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:15,109
Speaker 0: I was waiting for it.

1129
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:18,317
Speaker 1: All right.

1130
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:20,105
Speaker 1: Is there anything else we can?

1131
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,491
Speaker 1: I mean, we could talk about this for a long time.

1132
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:22,234
Speaker 0: I could I could.

1133
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:30,610
Speaker 0: I could basically spend about a half hour outlining my whole like all the evidence for the allegory of the relationship between creator and created.

1134
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:32,630
Speaker 0: But I think it's self-evident.

1135
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,470
Speaker 1: It's pretty it's extremely self-evident.

1136
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:41,229
Speaker 1: It's even one of the stupid questions which says, in what ways does Qteen eighty four question and complicate conventional ideas of authorship?

1137
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:44,370
Speaker 1: How does it blur the line between fictional reality and ordinary reality?

1138
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,550
Speaker 1: Those two questions are unrelated.

1139
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:51,656
Speaker 1: But the first question is conventional ideas of authorship, which is yeah, that's one of the primary things about them.

1140
00:56:51,676 --> 00:57:00,412
Speaker 1: But the other thing is, you know, a lot of books, you know, great books sort of have a main point, you know, like Lord of the Flies, main point.

1141
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:06,429
Speaker 1: Look how people behave when they're left to their own devices, you know, in a animal farm, communism.

1142
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:07,352
Speaker 1: Right.

1143
00:57:07,432 --> 00:57:12,030
Speaker 1: When you have a book like this, there's actually multiple main points.

1144
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,309
Speaker 1: He's got so many pages to work with and so much going on.

1145
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,310
Speaker 1: You know, there isn't just one main point.

1146
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:26,773
Speaker 1: It's like, here are all these points coming from the same story, you know, and look how these points tie into each other, sort of, you know, and there is no one simple thing saying.

1147
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:28,510
Speaker 1: the book is saying this.

1148
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:40,110
Speaker 1: It's like the book is saying all these things and all those things create together, create a mosaic or tapestry that becomes the message of the book that you can't necessarily say in one sentence.

1149
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,949
Speaker 0: And there are just so many great scenes that just pound those ideas in.

1150
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:49,630
Speaker 0: And the scenes themselves are great, almost like though it didn't tie them together.

1151
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:51,510
Speaker 0: Well, think about Boondock Saints as a movie.

1152
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:57,850
Speaker 0: Every individual scene was amazing, but the thread through them was pretty weak.

1153
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:04,312
Speaker 0: This book had scenes like that, but the threads through them were so numerous and so strong.

1154
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:10,130
Speaker 0: Like, remember when the NHK collector started knocking on all the doors?

1155
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,939
Speaker 1: Oh, when he's not.

1156
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,490
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

1157
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:12,850
Speaker 0: Every one of those scenes was great.

1158
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:21,849
Speaker 0: And when the one moment when Uchika was there and the guy knocks on his door, I was like, yes, Uchika was going to get a picture of this fucker.

1159
00:58:22,214 --> 00:58:22,904
Speaker 0: And then he didn't.

1160
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, no.

1161
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:29,570
Speaker 1: Oh, that was that whole sequence with the knocking that the dad.

1162
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:30,650
Speaker 1: I know you're in there.

1163
00:58:31,192 --> 00:58:33,950
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, my God, that was genius.

1164
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,950
Speaker 0: Everything about this book is just great.

1165
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:36,592
Speaker 1: All right.

1166
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:38,790
Speaker 1: If you didn't read it already.

1167
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you didn't read it, you should read it, even though we just spoiled everything.

1168
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:43,097
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1169
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:43,910
Speaker 1: All right.

1170
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,150
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to get home before I get lightning or whatever.

1171
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:47,631
Speaker 0: All right.

1172
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:51,150
Speaker 0: So we out there may or may not be shows next week.

1173
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:53,469
Speaker 0: They'll probably at best be a Monday show.

1174
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:55,150
Speaker 0: And then I'll be in Sao Paulo.

1175
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:06,180
Speaker 0: And yeah, this has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1176
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,318
