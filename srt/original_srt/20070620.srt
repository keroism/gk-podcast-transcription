1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,168
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday June 20th.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,172
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:14,480
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:22,364
Speaker 0: Tonight we have the audacity to review neon Genesis Evangelion.

5
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:39,714
Speaker 0: Let's do this This weekend and this weekend only for at least another about 365 days in other words on July.

6
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,565
Speaker 0: no, it's June June.

7
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:51,482
Speaker 0: I think 23 and 24 possibly also the 22 I don't remember is The museum of comic and cartoon art arts festival.

8
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:58,447
Speaker 0: and no that is not redundant saying arts twice Because art is in the name of the museum, and it's also the museum's art festival.

9
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:00,915
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it Just call it mocha and be done with it.

10
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:04,025
Speaker 0: Yes, even though mocha is the name of the museum, but regardless.

11
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:08,179
Speaker 0: This is the perhaps only Only Comic convention.

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,747
Speaker 0: that doesn't suck.

13
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:16,990
Speaker 1: yeah I mean we went last year and not only was I pleasantly surprised and somewhat overwhelmed, but it was downright awesome.

14
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:22,250
Speaker 0: basically what the mocha arts festival is is Imagine an artist's alley.

15
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:31,390
Speaker 0: But the artist's alley is all comic creators and everyone sits at their own little table And they sell their comic wares whatever sort of comic related business.

16
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,198
Speaker 0: They've got you know some podcasters artists writers.

17
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:37,046
Speaker 0: Whoever some retailers publishers.

18
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:37,949
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:52,321
Speaker 0: and It's in this many ballrooms in the puck building in New York City And you just walk around and you go to a table and you see a comic there and the person sitting behind the table Is the person who makes the comic and they're like hi?

20
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:52,963
Speaker 0: How you doing.

21
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,170
Speaker 0: and the best part about mocha?

22
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,449
Speaker 0: I think what really sets it apart from all the other comic conventions is that?

23
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:09,570
Speaker 0: You go there, and you see like this big-name guy like the guy who makes DMZ right he's gonna be there Yep, or the only guy the only guy he's pretty big or he eyes no award-winning alley guy.

24
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:19,889
Speaker 0: And they're standing there, and you could talk to them and sitting next to them at the next table is some kid who printed out his comic at Kinko's this morning, and it's still stapling it together.

25
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:34,950
Speaker 0: and When you have like these top of the like these professional people sitting next to these complete amateurs on an equal playing field It's super awesome because it's all about the arts and not about the business or the collecting or any other bullshit.

26
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:40,890
Speaker 1: That's the best part about mocha aside from the fact that everyone there was really friendly and there really weren't any scary fanboys around.

27
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:48,250
Speaker 1: But yeah Everyone's cool Indie comic type most of all was the fact that when I walked up to a table and just like started looking at a comic.

28
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:53,030
Speaker 1: They didn't immediately try the hard sell or try to force me to buy their comic.

29
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,830
Speaker 1: They just kind of sat there and let me browse and didn't pester me every comic con.

30
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,270
Speaker 1: I've gone to the comic artists practically demand that I buy a comic and they're really pushy.

31
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,313
Speaker 1: I really hate that.

32
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:09,189
Speaker 0: yeah when you go to comic cons like a wizard world or you know any other type of place I walked away from tables at wizard world.

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,780
Speaker 1: Yes I'd pick something up and they'd be like hey you're gonna buy that.

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,656
Speaker 0: you can buy all these - a lot of those places Are very business II.

35
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,182
Speaker 0: they have dealers rooms.

36
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:22,688
Speaker 0: They have you know all these other things Whereas mocha is just artists who want to hang out.

37
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:25,445
Speaker 0: mostly They're more there to see each other than they are to see you.

38
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:33,346
Speaker 0: a lot of them and There's like a whole bunch of awesome Like after parties, but I don't know if we can go to any cuz then we won't be able to get home.

39
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:37,050
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, granted we could just sleep on the streets of New York City.

40
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 1: It's not like we haven't done that or not sleep?

41
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,027
Speaker 0: stay at the after party till 5 a.m.

42
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:41,690
Speaker 0: Then take the train.

43
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:43,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we'll wait one more year.

44
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:46,870
Speaker 1: We've got enough crap to deal with regarding cons this year.

45
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,670
Speaker 1: I know I mean Oh - con I'm not gonna say much.

46
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:56,150
Speaker 1: It's still not all set in stone and it's getting down to the wire, yep, so this Saturday pretty much all day.

47
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,007
Speaker 0: Well, I'll send I'll put a link to the to the website about the arts festivals.

48
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:08,687
Speaker 0: not even a convention It's an arts festival in the the front with the website and the show note whatever thing where we usually put the news and things of the day.

49
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:19,290
Speaker 0: and If you are anywhere new in New York City, and you like comic books even a little bit It's worth your time to go especially because it's really cheap really cheap.

50
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:24,245
Speaker 1: also I would like to know cuz I'm holding in my hand that I think the highlight of the con was.

51
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:32,790
Speaker 1: there was one table with these Artists and they made a bunch of pac-man s ghosts and each one was entirely unique from all the others and they were just free.

52
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:37,450
Speaker 0: So we both picked one up dutifully and I suppose people better be there so I could find out who the hell that is.

53
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,497
Speaker 1: It was brilliant cuz.

54
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:40,270
Speaker 1: I remembered them very clearly.

55
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,615
Speaker 1: I was very excited about.

56
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:52,918
Speaker 0: they was like the best business card ever except that I forgot who they were Their name or their website on the back or something and the ghost isn't saying or at least like a word That I could search on Google and find them.

57
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,910
Speaker 1: the ghost just stares at me with his kind of vacant ghost eyes.

58
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,563
Speaker 0: My ghost does the same thing.

59
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:58,390
Speaker 0: He's just as useless.

60
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,365
Speaker 1: I love him, but I wish I knew who it was so I could give them some props on the show.

61
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:03,690
Speaker 0: little necrophilia for him.

62
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,725
Speaker 0: They hey ghosts can be hot.

63
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:08,535
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, news time.

64
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:12,310
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if I talked about this last week or not.

65
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,637
Speaker 0: I felt like I talked about on the show and if I did talk about it on the show That's just tough shit.

66
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:27,056
Speaker 0: I'm talking about the show twice, but Because I've talked about this is like everyone here like ten times and I didn't see it linked to on our website So I assume I did not talk.

67
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:38,368
Speaker 1: we have this problem more and more where we'll talk about something independent of the show and then we'll do the show and we won't remember if we talked about that on the show or not because as Much as you might not believe it

68
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:39,193
Speaker 0: The way

69
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,890
Speaker 1: we talk on the show is almost exactly the same as the way we talk to each other in person.

70
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,995
Speaker 0: Yes, so this is show.

71
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:49,366
Speaker 0: it's a new anime that's on TV called bokurano and it's hot it's.

72
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:50,810
Speaker 0: it's like our favorite show.

73
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,090
Speaker 0: now I think we talked about the show in a previous episode.

74
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,050
Speaker 0: In fact, I know we talked about the show to to use the Dave and Joel is the business.

75
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,610
Speaker 0: So if you want to know about the show, we did a previous episode and you can go look it up or whatever.

76
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:10,950
Speaker 0: But the story is the original Manga ka mohiro Akito who also made shadow star narutaru and vendor mayor no Tsubasa.

77
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,577
Speaker 0: By the way shadow stars pretty cool.

78
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:16,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like shadow star, but we'll talk a little bit about that in a minute.

79
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:26,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is a manga car who makes manga We like made the manga for bokurano, which I don't think is in English yet But when it is I'm gonna buy it now until bokurano and until this news.

80
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,782
Speaker 1: and when I took our friend Alex is really into shadow star and I didn't know much about.

81
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:41,175
Speaker 1: I didn't realize but I kind of guessed that Shadowstar was the same guy as this and now that I've seen three independent things that this person has done Little bit of a dark streak.

82
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:47,996
Speaker 1: Yeah little bit that these things really all start out not so dark Relative to how dark they guys.

83
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:52,650
Speaker 0: the guys formula seems to be that you have sort of normal characters.

84
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:56,070
Speaker 0: They're not like super super cute, but they're also not super super dark.

85
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:05,867
Speaker 0: They're you know typical anime very human realistic characters But anime style with some bright colors and not stupidly bright colors like moe but just regular bright.

86
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:06,870
Speaker 1: I really like the style.

87
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,305
Speaker 0: Yep, then he throws in like one cute thing like some like star.

88
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:13,649
Speaker 0: or what's the guys?

89
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:14,130
Speaker 0: dung beetle?

90
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah dung beetle, right some weird creature.

91
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:18,500
Speaker 0: That's pretty cute and strange.

92
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:22,370
Speaker 0: and then he throws in some incredibly dark actual plot.

93
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,500
Speaker 0: That's like a big dark evil robot.

94
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,850
Speaker 0: Oh, it's actually freaking scary and it's a little worse.

95
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,690
Speaker 1: I mean Sailor Moon starts out light and gets kind of dark as it goes on and darker and darker.

96
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,334
Speaker 1: This starts darker than Sailor Moon ends.

97
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:44,370
Speaker 1: and you think all right, I'm comfortable with this level of darkness and Much like now and then here and there it's just a rocket straight down.

98
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:54,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the reason that his his darkness works really well is because other shows in manga They're just dark likes from the bat off the bat and it's just like black all the way across.

99
00:07:54,791 --> 00:08:05,785
Speaker 0: This guy maintains this contrast between the cute creature the normal looking characters Who you can relate to and this dark backdrop and the contrast is very unsettling.

100
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,247
Speaker 1: Yes.

101
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:07,090
Speaker 1: Plus it's just.

102
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,372
Speaker 1: It's so.

103
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:17,762
Speaker 1: the characters are generally so realistic and normal with normal problems and they have normal emotions and they react to things Kind of the way you would expect people to react and it's just.

104
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:24,532
Speaker 1: really you don't feel like it should be as dark as it Is and it even though even if you know, it's coming it takes you off guard a little bit Yep.

105
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:25,155
Speaker 0: All right.

106
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:28,030
Speaker 0: So this got the mangaka, right?

107
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:35,710
Speaker 0: He wrote this manga and a guy named Horiyuki Morita who is the director of the cat returns, so he's not a bad director.

108
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:45,049
Speaker 0: He is directing the bokurano anime which we were enjoying as we were watching it And I guess we're still watching it which is coming from Gonzo which you know.

109
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:48,749
Speaker 1: So we know that at least the first half is gonna be awesome.

110
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,529
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, it's been awesome so far.

111
00:08:50,691 --> 00:09:06,848
Speaker 0: But this news story is that the director of the anime Does not like the direction the manga went into and he asked permission from the manga Creator if he could change it and if you know the plot of bokurano You could pretty much guess what's being changed and whatnot and it's

112
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:07,370
Speaker 1: yeah.

113
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,330
Speaker 1: Apparently the guy making the anime has somewhat of a problem with just killing children indiscriminately.

114
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, who would have guessed who would've guessed?

115
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:23,750
Speaker 0: so while this doesn't necessarily like a bunch I know a bunch of people are gonna be screaming like blah blah blah now that my anime sucks not gonna watch it.

116
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,780
Speaker 0: Actually, I got two things two feelings on it.

117
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,484
Speaker 0: one feeling is that this is kind of good because now You know when the anime and the manga are exactly the same.

118
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:34,570
Speaker 0: There's no point in doing both.

119
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,470
Speaker 0: That's why I didn't really watch the Death Note anime, even though I really like the Death Note anime.

120
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,087
Speaker 1: It's just I know the story unless it deviates all I'm gonna watch.

121
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:42,810
Speaker 1: you're like the fight.

122
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:50,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna watch the scene where someone shoots at someone with the sniper rifle from the helicopter Yep, and it's like, you know in in the Death Note anime.

123
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,410
Speaker 0: It's I know I've heard it's exactly the manga.

124
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,420
Speaker 0: So what am I missing if I read the manga?

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,741
Speaker 0: nothing.

126
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,590
Speaker 0: I have better things to do with my time.

127
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,006
Speaker 1: It would have been kind of cool if I hadn't.

128
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:01,502
Speaker 1: you know If I hadn't read the manga Death Note would probably my favorite anime right now.

129
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:12,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time I know the story of the manga at least the general premise and if that premise is sort of what drives the show and if That premise is gone.

130
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,909
Speaker 0: I really wonder what they're gonna do and I wonder if it's gonna be good or not.

131
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:26,390
Speaker 1: I really like the condition that the mangaka put on the anime person in terms of if they're allowed to do What they want to do and he says you can do it as long as you don't use magic.

132
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,444
Speaker 1: So he can't just kind of deus ex machina.

133
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:30,850
Speaker 1: Oh and everything's great.

134
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:48,400
Speaker 1: He has to kind of figure a way out and if anything we've talked a lot about how oftentimes the most creativity comes out of constraints and limitations and I have a hope that the director of the anime might go in a really interesting direction and That now I'll be able to read the manga and enjoy it.

135
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,917
Speaker 1: and I actually really want to read it now that I know Looking for it.

136
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, as soon as it comes out.

137
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:53,969
Speaker 0: I'll be on it.

138
00:10:54,422 --> 00:11:08,167
Speaker 1: Yeah Sadly the narutaru anime or manga at least kind of got cut off when everyone realized just how dark it gets If we had enough money, and if you got if anyone would don't ask enough money, we'd probably buy it and then translate it.

139
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:09,734
Speaker 0: Oh Probably.

140
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:09,996
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:10,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

142
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:10,904
Speaker 0: Yeah.

143
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:26,221
Speaker 0: anyway It's gonna be interesting to see if the anime Starts to suck as a result of the director not liking what the story is yeah, or if The anime is actually good but different from the manga.

144
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,530
Speaker 1: All I know is what I've seen to the anime so far.

145
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,937
Speaker 0: I really like yep, me too.

146
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:36,255
Speaker 1: I mean that and claymore are the only things I'm watching and even claymore is starting to fall off Even though I love it.

147
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:36,958
Speaker 1: I just don't have time.

148
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,828
Speaker 0: I'm watching the two terrors on the train.

149
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,250
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm gonna have to catch up on that later.

150
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,677
Speaker 0: It's actually good because it doesn't really deviate.

151
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:44,963
Speaker 0: it does but it's it's sort of just.

152
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:49,640
Speaker 0: they add a whole bunch and they really flesh out because they only had three volumes of manga to work with.

153
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:55,820
Speaker 0: so they make up a whole bunch of stuff to fill in the Gaps, but it's not meaningless stuff, but it's not.

154
00:11:56,001 --> 00:12:01,037
Speaker 0: it doesn't change like the main happenings of the plot really Yeah, plus I'm spending all my time.

155
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,804
Speaker 1: Finally watching the rest of gunkutsu.

156
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:05,417
Speaker 1: Oh, no, which I mean I'm a big fan of.

157
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,070
Speaker 0: tell me when you get to like the last two DVDs.

158
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,126
Speaker 0: All right, I just watched like 23 episodes.

159
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:10,590
Speaker 1: Here's how sad it is.

160
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:19,270
Speaker 1: I just got up to the point at which I stopped watching the fan subs when they were coming out Which is when Haiti almost falls off the ledge in the balcony.

161
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:23,423
Speaker 1: Like that was the last episode I'd seen and I just watched it again.

162
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,130
Speaker 1: So now I'm really pumped to watch the rest.

163
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:27,441
Speaker 0: Alright, yeah, tell me when you get to the robots.

164
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:27,824
Speaker 0: Yes.

165
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:37,150
Speaker 1: So anyway now there has been some talk about this golden ticket going on at Anime Expo and Frankly, I want to wait until there's a lot more information.

166
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:43,929
Speaker 1: I might even wait until after Anime Expo to talk about that Because I'd like to be able to say how it went in addition to how I feel about it.

167
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:46,550
Speaker 1: But I did notice this interesting story.

168
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,729
Speaker 1: I just want to bring it up because it's kind of related to us a little bit.

169
00:12:50,191 --> 00:13:03,425
Speaker 1: but here on anime news network, it turns out that Lionsgate is reanimating speed racer, which a lot of people knew and apparently they're doing it with Animation collective a New York animation studio and it just so happens that Emily worked there for a while.

170
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,229
Speaker 0: I think that's it Yeah, and they're pretty cool.

171
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:16,757
Speaker 1: Also, I was reading this news and I find it interesting that they very pointedly say I'm just gonna quote this here this 2008 Reincarnation features the original speed racers son.

172
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:17,359
Speaker 1: Now.

173
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:23,693
Speaker 1: Here's the part that bothers me who drives a non gas-guzzling Mach 6?

174
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:28,790
Speaker 1: Now why would you bring that up in a news article for one that has nothing to do with the story at all?

175
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:33,283
Speaker 1: Because the story here is the animation studio and everyone that's doing it not.

176
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,308
Speaker 1: Hey, it's a hybrid car or whatever.

177
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:42,450
Speaker 1: and - is This really just like water world where the bad guys happen to be smokers and they smoked cigarettes?

178
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,073
Speaker 1: Oh, no, is?

179
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:43,836
Speaker 1: they smoke cigarettes.

180
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,599
Speaker 1: They're bad guys.

181
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:46,990
Speaker 1: Is this some sort of heavy-handed?

182
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:53,010
Speaker 1: Unsubtle environmental message as opposed to the much more subtle and awesome way that say Miyazaki would do that?

183
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:55,572
Speaker 0: It's?

184
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:56,196
Speaker 0: I just don't.

185
00:13:56,276 --> 00:13:57,001
Speaker 0: it's stupid.

186
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:05,250
Speaker 1: yeah regardless I'm kind of interested in this because I kind of like speed racer But I like the idea of speed racer more than I actually like watching speed race.

187
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,462
Speaker 0: Yes, actually reading this news story reminded me.

188
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:18,340
Speaker 0: So when I got home, I watched the English speed racer opener and I watched the original Japanese speed racer opener, which I had never realized I had never seen.

189
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:27,590
Speaker 0: and first of all The the Japanese speed racer opener is much longer and includes a lot more stuff like this big scene of driving through the wilderness.

190
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,794
Speaker 0: So these animals and elephants how much longer?

191
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,657
Speaker 1: what it's like 20 minutes like a whole minute longer.

192
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:32,920
Speaker 0: Ah, it's crazy.

193
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:39,090
Speaker 0: and The song you can tell how they derive the English song from the Japanese one.

194
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:42,127
Speaker 0: but the Japanese lyrics and singing is.

195
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:47,910
Speaker 0: I Enjoy that more because it's you know, got those Japanese guys singing in there.

196
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:50,330
Speaker 0: You know the way they sing for old giant robot shows and stuff.

197
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,828
Speaker 1: I I really like that kind of me too.

198
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:59,188
Speaker 1: But even though I know in my heart that it's kind of lame, but that almost intensifies my like for it.

199
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:06,625
Speaker 0: Yep But the thing is the American opener starts out with that And I really like that noise.

200
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:07,369
Speaker 0: that's good noise.

201
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:14,170
Speaker 0: But the Japanese opener starts with like this cool jazz riff action and it's hard to pick one.

202
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:15,536
Speaker 0: So, I don't know.

203
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,410
Speaker 0: I guess the Japanese version is better overall.

204
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:29,222
Speaker 0: But the American opener is not without merit, but the court the singing in the American opener while that song, you know Here he comes Right while that song is, you know a classic.

205
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,350
Speaker 0: It's really corny.

206
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,714
Speaker 1: I just remember.

207
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:34,398
Speaker 1: listen to that just reminded me.

208
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:38,630
Speaker 1: remember that speed racer initial D music video.

209
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:40,197
Speaker 1: Yeah to that song.

210
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:40,619
Speaker 0: Yep.

211
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,347
Speaker 1: I was suddenly reminded to that.

212
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:52,936
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright sure Things of the day.

213
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:58,892
Speaker 1: All I got to say is balls of steel balls balls Steel.

214
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:03,549
Speaker 1: it's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum and I'm all out of gum.

215
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,062
Speaker 0: I will tear off your head and fuck down your.

216
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:08,106
Speaker 1: I believe it was shit.

217
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:09,190
Speaker 0: Oh shit, whatever.

218
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,742
Speaker 1: That's just kind of creepy where you went with that.

219
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, but there's one.

220
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:20,090
Speaker 1: It's one thing to degrade your opponent after you know beating them much like the classic stand over your opponent and repeatedly hit crouch.

221
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:30,581
Speaker 1: yeah, I Remember thinking I was so clever when I did that once way back in the day and like action quake I was like man, I'm totally humiliating him.

222
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,550
Speaker 1: No one else ever thought to do this before.

223
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:35,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one ever thought to shoot the guy after he's dead.

224
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:38,461
Speaker 1: That was a big deal in action quake.

225
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,969
Speaker 1: He's only had like four bullets anyway.

226
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,439
Speaker 1: but now Basically the point of my thing of the day is that there are some people Who might otherwise be good.

227
00:16:48,479 --> 00:17:04,857
Speaker 1: people might be intelligent might lead normal lives but when confronted with the Internet a world in which people can be anonymous and we all know from John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad theory that anonymity on The internet is a dangerous quantity.

228
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:10,075
Speaker 0: It usually just turns the internet into a shitcock generator Yeah, something like that.

229
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:15,757
Speaker 1: I remember our old CS server shit cock list and That was the best CS server ever.

230
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:19,630
Speaker 1: I was I mean we could only have like six people on it or it was too slow.

231
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,270
Speaker 1: So we'd start getting packet loss and the only map we could run without it crashing was icy world.

232
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was full 24/7 all the time.

233
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,623
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

234
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,430
Speaker 0: We'd kick because the ping was so low.

235
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,926
Speaker 1: Yep, we'd kick people off every time we wanted to play.

236
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:35,485
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, and for some reason we never set the limit to six.

237
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:36,470
Speaker 1: the limit was always like ten.

238
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,839
Speaker 1: So we had to keep kicking people to keep the ping down.

239
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,670
Speaker 0: No, I set the limit lower eventually not right away.

240
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:45,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember constantly kicking people to keep the packet loss from coming.

241
00:17:45,263 --> 00:18:01,336
Speaker 1: But anyway, there are some people You know normally normal people but when confronted with a shit cocker on the internet Aren't quite aware of the fact that the the reach of their power does not extend through the wires Into that other person's physical space.

242
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:14,330
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of like I don't know Star Wars and Someone's making trouble way out in the Outer Rim and the Empire is like yeah We'll get you but it's gonna take the Empire like months to get a fleet out there.

243
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:22,830
Speaker 0: They can't do anything to the guy making trouble in the Outer Rim Especially if that guy has the Millennium Falcon, which is so fast that they'll be gone by the time the Empire gets course.

244
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,670
Speaker 1: That was probably a bad example because we all know that Vice Admiral Thrawn was out there kicking ass left and right.

245
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:29,175
Speaker 0: We that we do.

246
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:31,021
Speaker 0: I gotta read those books someday.

247
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:35,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of what I know about Admiral Thrawn I learned from Wikipedia and TIE fighter.

248
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:42,064
Speaker 1: Yep, but there are people out there who just when confronted with someone who is Are you saying it for the third time?

249
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:42,510
Speaker 1: I don't know.

250
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:43,478
Speaker 1: I'm going more specific.

251
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:49,585
Speaker 1: when someone's griefing them on the internet They just can't take it and it breaks down their AT field and they just lose it.

252
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,210
Speaker 1: Yeah now this video.

253
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,421
Speaker 1: Basically, someone makes a soundboard of Duke Nukem.

254
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:56,970
Speaker 1: And if you might remember Duke Nukem doesn't have many things to say.

255
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:12,040
Speaker 1: Balls of steel And in ventrilo at least this ventrilo server, which is obviously being run by some mother for like her son's clan somewhere You can't seem to really tell who's saying what.

256
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:15,774
Speaker 1: so someone is logged in and basically Being Duke Nukem.

257
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:20,910
Speaker 1: and he only says Duke Nukem things when this mother says anything and it starts out kind of lame.

258
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:26,370
Speaker 1: But just bear with it because once you realize how insane this woman is getting it's quite entertaining.

259
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:31,848
Speaker 0: Why first of all, what kind of piece of shit is ventrilo that you can't tell who's saying what?

260
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:33,619
Speaker 0: TeamSpeak You can tell who's saying what.

261
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,294
Speaker 1: so ventrilo- Counter-strike I can tell who's saying what.

262
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:41,149
Speaker 1: not that it matters because they're all saying the same thing as shut the fuck up you faggot noob.

263
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:46,006
Speaker 0: But you can't tell who's saying what in ventrilo or I don't know.

264
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,010
Speaker 0: I've never used ventrilo.

265
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,216
Speaker 0: So maybe you can tell who's saying what.

266
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:53,548
Speaker 0: and this lady is just so stupid that she can't tell who's saying what.

267
00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:02,090
Speaker 1: this lady Exemplifies the Set of steps that a person on the internet who doesn't realize that they are impotent against a griefer goes through.

268
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:08,082
Speaker 1: Because at one point right away, she basically says yeah, I know who you are You're banned and the guy keeps talking.

269
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:09,489
Speaker 1: so obviously she was lying.

270
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:25,609
Speaker 1: Yep, and the best part is I am reasonably certain that the person doing this was either her son himself I think it was the son or someone closely involved to all of this and I think it was a staged Attempt to drive his mother over the edge.

271
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:33,709
Speaker 0: I think it was indeed and actually it's pretty funny when the mother leaves for a minute and the other guy is like yeah That was pretty hilarious until she freaked out.

272
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:37,774
Speaker 1: So balls of steel.

273
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:40,141
Speaker 0: yes, just just I guess listen to this.

274
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:46,289
Speaker 1: and no you got to watch it because every time Duke Nukem speaks It cuts to this smarmy looking picture of Duke Nukem.

275
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:49,579
Speaker 0: This is why I've been waiting for Duke Nukem forever.

276
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,990
Speaker 0: if you haven't if you've never experienced Duke Nukem before this will be your first.

277
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:54,358
Speaker 1: Duke Nukem is quiet.

278
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,510
Speaker 1: I mean Duke Nukem 3d was a really good game.

279
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:08,309
Speaker 0: I gotta say it was if the big news if people don't remember when quake one and Duke Nukem 3d They both came out and it was a hotly contested debate as to which one was the game.

280
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,717
Speaker 1: Duke Nukem was hot shit, and I played it.

281
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,309
Speaker 0: all the many video game magazines are like quake is crap.

282
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:18,468
Speaker 0: sure It looks a little better, but it's a crap game compared to the awesomeness that is Duke 3d.

283
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:26,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, Duke 3d was a lot more in the doom line in terms of how gameplay progressed And there was a lot of really sick humor in it.

284
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:27,233
Speaker 0: It was a good game.

285
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:30,244
Speaker 1: granted the humor was all aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 12.5.

286
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:33,556
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, maybe 13.

287
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:34,480
Speaker 1: Maybe 13

288
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:51,829
Speaker 0: all right, so if you're an a nine or manga readers watcher Yeah, if you're an experiencer and enjoyer of Japanese Culture and artistic works that are delivered over here to the United States or to whatever country you may live in

289
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:52,613
Speaker 1: You

290
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:56,050
Speaker 0: might notice that Japanese people they like to apologize.

291
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:59,557
Speaker 0: They apologize just about everything.

292
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,162
Speaker 0: They're like oh my god.

293
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:02,787
Speaker 0: I'm sorry got in a car accident.

294
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,152
Speaker 0: Oh my god I'm sorry.

295
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:05,578
Speaker 0: I did better than you on the test.

296
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,362
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

297
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:06,743
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

298
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,386
Speaker 0: You're stupid.

299
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sorry I bought the last DS in the store here.

300
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:12,310
Speaker 1: You can have I guess except for the rape of Nanking.

301
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:19,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, except for that everything else everything else they apologize profusely and often with varying levels of apology.

302
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:23,846
Speaker 0: This video here is quite awesome because it's dual purpose.

303
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:33,487
Speaker 0: on the one hand It shows you all the different styles of Japanese apology all the different degrees of apology from the simple You know who I bumped into you to the ooh.

304
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:37,789
Speaker 0: I failed the the hit and now you please don't cut off my finger.

305
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:43,730
Speaker 0: And it shows you how to correctly bow and apologize in the different ways.

306
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:49,296
Speaker 0: But it is also humorous if you zoom in on it cuz in YouTube It's kind of zoomed out.

307
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:51,630
Speaker 0: you need to zoom in on it somehow go full screen or something.

308
00:22:52,151 --> 00:23:03,870
Speaker 0: they explain the situations in which you would use the different types of bow and how to execute them correctly and It's pretty funny, especially the the ninja apology.

309
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:07,674
Speaker 0: And So this is worth watching.

310
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:12,990
Speaker 0: whether you are confused about Japanese apologizing or whether you are familiar with it and want to laugh.

311
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:19,590
Speaker 0: They also give the correct Japanese names for all the different types of apologies so you can learn them.

312
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,750
Speaker 0: Maybe if you're trying to learn Japanese might be really useful.

313
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:29,791
Speaker 0: I've ever go to Japan because or if you're watching an anime and someone does one of the Apologies and then you just yell out the name of it and see who laughs I don't know.

314
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:43,053
Speaker 1: just somehow I get the impression that when I do finally visit Japan while I'm going to have a great time And while I'm going to try to be very culturally aware I am pretty much a hundred percent sure that I'm going to offend a fair number of people at some point depending on how long I am there.

315
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:44,443
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm gonna offend people.

316
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:45,027
Speaker 0: Just see me.

317
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:48,338
Speaker 0: They're gonna come say you and be like that guy.

318
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:50,064
Speaker 1: that guy's not a team player.

319
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,207
Speaker 1: Not at all.

320
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:52,657
Speaker 1: Look at him Look at him go.

321
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:56,576
Speaker 0: Yeah Apparently, I heard that there was.

322
00:23:56,857 --> 00:24:02,134
Speaker 0: I was reading actually a story today about how Akihabara is getting all this tourists going on from other Countries, right?

323
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,810
Speaker 1: They're probably all anime fans from America.

324
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:10,010
Speaker 0: They showed like a picture of a French guy who visited there and he was looking at some perverted statues.

325
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:27,286
Speaker 0: But basically they set up some sort of like cultural center there or something that was designed by the Pokemon guy you know to sort of have tourists go to and Apparently like 7% of its traffic is from tourists, which is a big deal.

326
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:28,770
Speaker 0: apparently like that's a lot.

327
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,920
Speaker 1: Alright, I think we've delayed long enough.

328
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:55,344
Speaker 1: every now and then on a show like this There's an episode that you'd expect us to do a thing You'd expect us to talk about and yet much like the other podcasts or reviewers or whatever We know you can't we kind of hold out and wait to do these things Because you don't want to screw it up and there's a lot to say and a lot of people are waiting Waiting, I know of you personally to jump all over us about anything.

329
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,310
Speaker 1: We may or may not say over the course of it.

330
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:10,429
Speaker 0: Yep, and if you haven't noticed, I mean, there's probably some podcasts out there and that have you know, God and done Certain shows, you know that or manga that are super important and super popular.

331
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:14,582
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember Daryl Surratt's gushing love fest before we talked about.

332
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:15,545
Speaker 1: do you remember love?

333
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,047
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,862
Speaker 1: Yeah And not a good movie.

335
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:20,210
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan.

336
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:26,710
Speaker 0: I mean, I would like macross almost more than anything but I'd like the TV show and I'm not a fan of compilation movies.

337
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,417
Speaker 0: No, which is what do you remember?

338
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:31,430
Speaker 0: love is but if you like macross just watch the TV show.

339
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,314
Speaker 0: What's the point of that move?

340
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:35,770
Speaker 0: You don't have time I guess but it's worth your time.

341
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:38,386
Speaker 1: I skipped most of the middle of the TV show.

342
00:25:38,426 --> 00:25:39,010
Speaker 0: you suck.

343
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:41,390
Speaker 1: Well, mostly because you watch it when I wasn't home and I gave up.

344
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:46,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna watch it again soon someday, but no tonight and I can't wait for the argument.

345
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:51,270
Speaker 1: I think our friend Conrad in particular is gonna jump down our throats in a second.

346
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:53,903
Speaker 1: He's been waiting for this forever because we have different.

347
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:54,566
Speaker 0: is he really?

348
00:25:54,606 --> 00:26:01,087
Speaker 1: I didn't think he was Has the exact opposite opinion of the show that we do pretty much step for step.

349
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:14,870
Speaker 1: Uh-huh tonight We are going to talk about Shin Seiki Evangelion aka Neon Genesis Evangelion one of the most popular anime one of the iconic anime in America.

350
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:22,404
Speaker 0: This thing's like 12 or 13 years old One of the most important anime ever in terms of anime histories and modern animes.

351
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:25,092
Speaker 1: now before we continue no spoilers Don't worry.

352
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:26,859
Speaker 1: We're reviewing this like we review anything else.

353
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,024
Speaker 1: We're not gonna spoil anything.

354
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,410
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about what happens.

355
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:42,430
Speaker 0: We're just gonna you know Talk about what this show is why we like it what we didn't like about it all those normal things and maybe a lot of information about the show because It's kind of hard to set the record straight on things granted not related things.

356
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,975
Speaker 0: But like what episodes do you watch?

357
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:44,477
Speaker 0: kind of things?

358
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,043
Speaker 1: Yes, particularly in the end.

359
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:48,090
Speaker 0: Yes, we have a confusing end.

360
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:58,402
Speaker 1: We have to mention something about the movies and the other movies and the re-releases of the movies and the manga and the potential Live-action video game the potential live-action.

361
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,209
Speaker 1: There's been potential for like a decade.

362
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:06,090
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, and two part of the reason we're reviewing this now is that way back way back.

363
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:21,528
Speaker 1: Well after we did our final thoughts episode on Big O to a lot of people were clamoring for us to do more final thoughts episodes and Our thinking was we really don't want to spoil the show That a lot of people haven't seen because then they either can't listen to our episode or they have to just let the show Be ruined.

364
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:29,416
Speaker 1: So as a result, we're reviewing Ava partly so that in a month or so when everyone who wants to see it has had a chance We can do our final thoughts

365
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:35,803
Speaker 0: and also because I haven't seen the show in like I don't know four years And I have to watch it again to do a final.

366
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:36,165
Speaker 0: Yes.

367
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:47,610
Speaker 1: Yes but actually it's good because we know a lot of people who haven't seen Ava and Also by not having seen it just now It's not gonna be easy to go off on specific plot tangents that we really don't

368
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:52,726
Speaker 0: Worry about me spoiling anything because I haven't seen this show since college in college.

369
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:57,448
Speaker 0: I think freshman year I watched it all the way through on VHS and then we marathoned it again later.

370
00:27:58,412 --> 00:27:59,095
Speaker 0: And that's all.

371
00:27:59,115 --> 00:27:59,377
Speaker 0: that's the.

372
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,269
Speaker 0: I've only ever seen the whole thing twice on VHS and that's it.

373
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:11,527
Speaker 1: Well, you can spoil Ava but in the same way that you can spoil any show that has Something so unbelievable happened at the end.

374
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:16,970
Speaker 0: Yeah It'd be difficult for me to spoil it, you know, if I wasn't trying to it's what I'm saying.

375
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like I could slip up and be like, oops.

376
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:21,368
Speaker 0: I forgot that that was a secret.

377
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,221
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway, I probably just forgot it.

378
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:28,722
Speaker 1: period Ava Whether or not you like it or you hate it.

379
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:29,687
Speaker 1: You think it's brilliant.

380
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,390
Speaker 1: You think it's crap.

381
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:38,130
Speaker 1: I just want to keep in mind while we talk about it that one This came out a long time ago and it set a lot of precedent.

382
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,440
Speaker 0: Yeah a long time ago as in less than 20 years.

383
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,068
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean ancient times like the 90s.

384
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:47,688
Speaker 1: I mean back then there were dragons as far as we knew in most of the world.

385
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:52,630
Speaker 1: But back, I mean a lot of the things that people say Oh Ava's so cliche.

386
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,286
Speaker 1: It really set a lot of precedents.

387
00:28:55,407 --> 00:29:02,913
Speaker 1: and well Even if you don't like Ava you at least have to admit that Ava is a very important anime in terms of how anime has Evolved now.

388
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:08,290
Speaker 1: Ava was directed by an interesting fellow named Hideaki Anno.

389
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:11,249
Speaker 1: We're not going to talk about the story behind him.

390
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,230
Speaker 1: If you want to know more about that check out anime world order.

391
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,136
Speaker 1: They'll go into great detail about that sort of thing.

392
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:20,930
Speaker 1: suffice to say the man is either brilliant or insane or both probably both.

393
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:23,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of those evil mad genius kind of guys.

394
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:37,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, and despite his nuttiness I think I think that he is one of the main reasons that Ava is what it is Regardless of how you take that like any others evil genius, you know They invent some crazy evil robot or something and the robot is really cool.

395
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,729
Speaker 0: But the actual evil genius is someone you never want to talk to.

396
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,090
Speaker 1: So very briefly because I think a lot of people have seen Ava.

397
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:53,350
Speaker 1: But just in case you haven't the story is actually fairly simple in terms of what's going on on the face value.

398
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:55,898
Speaker 1: What is the plot the seed of the plot?

399
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:56,158
Speaker 0: Okay.

400
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,182
Speaker 0: Here's the story already.

401
00:29:57,603 --> 00:30:04,019
Speaker 0: You have this earth and you have this city and On earth, there's some people living in this city.

402
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:07,068
Speaker 1: I think you can start a little bit less broad.

403
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:12,618
Speaker 1: Okay, okay I think I. basically I think you're gonna explain this really badly So I'm gonna stand by to re-explain it.

404
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,970
Speaker 0: these people have some robots And the reason they have robots is because they're under attack by these angels.

405
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:23,810
Speaker 0: But they're not angels with wing-a-lings and you know cupid bows and arrows.

406
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:30,890
Speaker 0: they're just giant horrible monsters that come from the sky sort of randomly and In each episode or in most of the episodes.

407
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:39,253
Speaker 0: And my angel comes down So they get in their robots and they have to fight it off or else it's gonna destroy their city and it's not gonna be good,

408
00:30:39,758 --> 00:31:02,677
Speaker 1: okay, so basically normal earth fast forward a little bit, you know technology is advancing about modern times is when it's really set and the Dead Sea Scrolls have Prophesized that God will send the angels down to destroy mankind and all sorts of other things and a semi shadow Organization of governments has gotten together Basically believing this to be somewhat true

409
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:03,640
Speaker 0: trying

410
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,709
Speaker 1: to deal with it prepare for it and prevent it.

411
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:13,850
Speaker 1: One thing leads to another and at some point there is a catastrophe on the earth known as the second impact.

412
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:18,973
Speaker 1: No I forgot about the first impact being when God created mankind Adam and Eve.

413
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:55,928
Speaker 1: all that as far as you know, the second impact is basically God Giving forth the harbinger of the end of the world saying now it begins you best be prepared now humanity having the prophecies and the Dead Sea Scrolls had been preparing and under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations had created an organization that with scientists and these prophecies had been preparing from that day forward for the day when the angels came and The anime picks up pretty much when that day comes and they're no longer crazy an Angel has come the military tries to deal with it.

414
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,433
Speaker 1: The military cannot.

415
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:12,870
Speaker 1: they finally relent agree that these people were not crazy and they hand over control of basically the combined economic output of the world to this organization to Basically try to fight off God and prevent the apocalypse.

416
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:16,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't find that out until well you kind of do it.

417
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:20,499
Speaker 1: they pretty much you know That's what the plot is and you know what's going on.

418
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,430
Speaker 1: It's actually a lot more complicated than that.

419
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:30,969
Speaker 1: There's actually like ten different organizations and there's all sorts of politics and it turns out that the Jews were behind it.

420
00:32:31,712 --> 00:32:45,219
Speaker 0: Not really, but kinda the thing in the show is that they hardly ever say anything right out, you know things are always alluded to and implied and Symbolized and Sometimes you think something's alluded to but it's not.

421
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:48,670
Speaker 0: they lied and it's that's why a lot of people are like whoa.

422
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,910
Speaker 0: It's a total mind-fucking show because you can't tell what's going on But

423
00:32:51,950 --> 00:33:01,990
Speaker 1: at the same time you can especially when you've watched it and you kind of know like the seed of the plot You really know what's going on and then you watch it again and you pick up a lot more.

424
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,409
Speaker 1: There seem to be a lot of shows like that.

425
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:03,631
Speaker 1: I

426
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:23,604
Speaker 0: think part of the reason that is is I remember there's a couple scenes in the show where they'll show you something visually without any words for like two seconds and that's if you see that in whatever place in time that it appears that Tells you a whole bunch of stuff that you didn't know otherwise And like you miss that you miss out on a whole bunch of information.

427
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:25,130
Speaker 0: that shines a lot of light.

428
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:28,625
Speaker 1: So like that one scene, this isn't a spoiler or anything on the aircraft carrier.

429
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:33,242
Speaker 0: Yeah with the suitcase Yeah, and they show you what's in the suitcase for like two seconds.

430
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:43,070
Speaker 0: And if you see it you go But if you don't see those two seconds if you blink You just missed out on like a whole thing and now you're not gonna understand stuff that happens later.

431
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,330
Speaker 1: I mean basically the way the show seems to work in terms in in terms of that sort of thing.

432
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,641
Speaker 1: Is that all the information is there?

433
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:51,490
Speaker 1: nothing actually comes out of nowhere?

434
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,261
Speaker 1: It's not like there's deus ex machina or just suddenly.

435
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:56,329
Speaker 1: Oh, well, it turns out that blah blah blah.

436
00:33:56,791 --> 00:34:02,610
Speaker 1: It's all there, but they show it to you kind of in the sense that the characters involved wouldn't have noticed.

437
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,934
Speaker 1: These are things that wouldn't have been easy to spot in the heat of the moment but they're just.

438
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:09,629
Speaker 1: they're kind of setting you up so that these things don't come out of nowhere.

439
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:16,108
Speaker 1: and Also, it's not like you see it and you think oh, I know what's going on It's more you see it and you think why would he have that?

440
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,047
Speaker 1: What what's going on?

441
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:25,329
Speaker 1: I don't like this one bit or like that scene when Ray's got the spear of long a noose and then stabs that thing that Was crucified somewhere?

442
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you don't find out what that was about for a long time.

443
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:34,429
Speaker 1: But once you do cuz that's the thing later on in the show something big will happen and you'll think back.

444
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,025
Speaker 1: You'll be like wait a minute, but I saw her stab that thing with the spear of law.

445
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,697
Speaker 1: Oh That's what that was.

446
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:44,340
Speaker 1: Whoa And there's a lot of that.

447
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:48,275
Speaker 1: now we've given you the backdrop of the show the way the show actually progresses.

448
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:55,386
Speaker 1: the story within this plot is that there is a young boy named Shinji Ikari and He is a loser.

449
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,121
Speaker 1: He's I mean he's not a loser.

450
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,910
Speaker 0: no one likes him you don't even like him.

451
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:00,495
Speaker 1: I don't like.

452
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,564
Speaker 1: I like him a lot more in the manga.

453
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,449
Speaker 1: I'll be honest I was I really don't like it.

454
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,616
Speaker 1: But the thing is you're not supposed to like him.

455
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:10,070
Speaker 1: because the thing about Ava is that all the characters are very human and they?

456
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,730
Speaker 1: All have very real psychological issues that they really can't deal with.

457
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:20,309
Speaker 0: It's kind of hard to not have psychological issues when giant monsters are coming out of the sky true.

458
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:28,910
Speaker 1: But even then the fact is that all these people have fairly simple Psychological issues, but they're very difficult to deal with and they're all very isolated from each other.

459
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:41,945
Speaker 1: And I think part of what makes Ava great is that there's all these characters and if at any point Anyone had talked to anyone else about their problems or opened up at all almost every problem that happened in the show could have been averted.

460
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:53,190
Speaker 1: but no Someone walks in on someone to see some crying and just kind of freaks out doesn't know what to do runs away and cries on Their own and then no one vents anything and everyone keeps everything bottled up and no one really trusts anyone.

461
00:35:54,012 --> 00:36:04,933
Speaker 1: It's really a fairly No, I don't want to say accurate but a fairly poignant and kind of biting commentary on what's wrong with humanity on a very Fundamental level.

462
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:08,869
Speaker 0: if you think that people have that kind of problem then yeah, I a lot of people do.

463
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:10,177
Speaker 1: I mean I part of it.

464
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:12,050
Speaker 1: I mean there are people in the show who don't have problems.

465
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:15,184
Speaker 1: It's just that many of the main characters you mean the cool people.

466
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:15,586
Speaker 1: Yeah.

467
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:23,590
Speaker 0: Yeah the cool people Yeah, well actually there's some cool people who have problems But they're better at like keeping their problems hidden away.

468
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,840
Speaker 0: Yeah They don't let their problems get in the way of getting shit done.

469
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,965
Speaker 1: like my man my favorite character in the show That guy is probably one of my favorite characters in anime ever.

470
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:33,889
Speaker 0: He's alright.

471
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:36,136
Speaker 1: Akaji is just the man.

472
00:36:36,356 --> 00:36:38,081
Speaker 0: He's got some nice watermelons.

473
00:36:38,382 --> 00:36:38,923
Speaker 0: He does.

474
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,450
Speaker 1: I was once mistaken as a kaji cosplayer.

475
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:43,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they even took a picture of me.

476
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,930
Speaker 1: I'm in fans view somewhere cuz I just happened to have not shaved at some Otakon.

477
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:54,104
Speaker 1: So I was all scruffy and I had my hair tied back in a ponytail And I was dressed in like a collared shirt and a tie and pants.

478
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:56,070
Speaker 1: and I was hot because it was summer.

479
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:59,410
Speaker 1: So I had my tie kind of losing the top button on button and some guy walk.

480
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,249
Speaker 1: Somebody's like hey nice kaji cosplay and he takes a picture and I'm like what?

481
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,706
Speaker 1: But yeah, but the story is Shinji kari.

482
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:39,195
Speaker 1: this kid is the son of one of the men who is running this organization and For reasons I don't really want to get into the nitty-gritty of it but basically he gets embroiled in all this along with a lot of other children because it just so happens that the children the people who are able to Pilot these devices these Ava's these robots Have to have been born Pretty much like at a certain time like there's this window where kids were born and these people are the only people who have the capacity To pilot the robots.

483
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can't just like put soldiers in them and they can't put babies in them.

484
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:44,979
Speaker 0: They can't put nothing in them.

485
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,050
Speaker 0: They gotta put these kids in there.

486
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,658
Speaker 1: I mean another nice thing about the show is that at least as far as you can see It's not like they don't try.

487
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:53,849
Speaker 1: you think why don't they just have a military guy do it?

488
00:37:54,151 --> 00:38:00,208
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the characters are like military scientist people who are trying to figure out as much as they possibly can.

489
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:02,597
Speaker 0: of course Everything always goes wrong.

490
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:05,950
Speaker 0: Oh God goes more and more wrong every episode.

491
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,171
Speaker 0: My

492
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:20,549
Speaker 1: favorite thing is that the one thing that always bothered me about the show a little bit was that they have the kind of like Emergency cut the ties between the pilot and the robot in case something bad happens and eject the pilot and I guess it worked in training or whatever.

493
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:23,460
Speaker 1: But in the course of the show it never works.

494
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:28,217
Speaker 1: once and every time they try to do it It just doesn't work and there's some sort of catastrophe.

495
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:29,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like every single time.

496
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:34,450
Speaker 0: There's a robot fight with robot and an angel Right, they'll be sitting in the bridge.

497
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:42,604
Speaker 0: I guess it's not really a bridge because not a ship but it's like the war room where all the you know displays and controls Are forever know what it's the baby war room ever.

498
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:43,570
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good war.

499
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:44,719
Speaker 1: I mean, I've been to NASA.

500
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:49,379
Speaker 0: NASA looks really small anyway But they've got all these freaking lights and things.

501
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:53,210
Speaker 0: and every time there's a fight right always the worst possible thing happens.

502
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,594
Speaker 0: It's like warning warning warning.

503
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:58,645
Speaker 0: Oh my god extreme system failure system failure over there.

504
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,174
Speaker 0: Oh, everything's exploding It's overheating.

505
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,098
Speaker 0: God knows what's going on.

506
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:03,103
Speaker 0: We're running out of power.

507
00:39:03,163 --> 00:39:04,550
Speaker 0: Well, God does know what's going on.

508
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:12,759
Speaker 0: I know he's kind of behind it all but it's everything goes as wrong as it can every single time and Whatever they try to do to fix it never works.

509
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:15,910
Speaker 0: And it's why I didn't even bother with these computers.

510
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:17,130
Speaker 0: They just don't do anything.

511
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:39,452
Speaker 1: however while you might think that I do want to point out that Part of the reason that seems so strange through part of much of the show is that you don't know what's really going on Too much and you kind of take a lot of things at face value And you find out later in the show that you can't really trust what characters in the show have been telling you because either they're misinformed or they're lying or Something.

512
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:45,090
Speaker 1: and you start to find out that all the things that happen throughout the show happen for a reason.

513
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:58,643
Speaker 1: it's one of those shows where kind of like big O and big O - where Everything that happens happens for a reason there aren't really many loose pot plot threads and it all does come together in the end And I think a fairy fairly elegant way.

514
00:39:58,663 --> 00:39:59,850
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm gonna come back straight out.

515
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,530
Speaker 1: I don't think we said it Despite what a lot of you might say.

516
00:40:02,852 --> 00:40:19,070
Speaker 1: I really like and I really respect Evangelion and I think it has a lot to say and I think a lot of the people who are naysayers are just jaded By modern anime or I don't want to sound pretentious But I don't think a lot of people got it or they at most and I will respect this opinion and we'll get to this.

517
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:28,770
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people feel a little bit insulted at how Ava presented the message Because you know the story is this kid gets embroiled in all this and politics and one thing leads to another.

518
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:33,510
Speaker 1: What the show really is is the first four or five episodes are check it out.

519
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,573
Speaker 1: We got a robot show.

520
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:38,968
Speaker 1: God send angels to kill the world giant robots robot fights action show.

521
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:39,570
Speaker 1: Check it out.

522
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only that but a lot of these episodes they like.

523
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:48,104
Speaker 0: for half the episode They won't even have any God or robots or anything going on.

524
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:49,550
Speaker 1: It's Misato with her pet penguin.

525
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:54,889
Speaker 0: It's like people getting drunk hanging out with pet penguins and having all kinds of fun playing DDR.

526
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,839
Speaker 0: And who knows what else man Misato with.

527
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:01,070
Speaker 1: she has two fridges in her house one for food and one for beer.

528
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:05,180
Speaker 0: It is definitely still plenty of that classic anime

529
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:21,364
Speaker 1: comedy going on and there's actually at least in the first half of the show a More fan service than you would expect mostly about Misato who is probably iconic as one of the most idolized and I guess sexy anime characters at least in a first American except

530
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:27,974
Speaker 0: it seems like everyone likes the Younger characters because they're all perverted Hot if it hit him on the head

531
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:33,370
Speaker 1: in Scott and mine's old man generation Misato was hot because Misato was an adult.

532
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:35,675
Speaker 0: But I got.

533
00:41:36,096 --> 00:41:36,358
Speaker 0: yes.

534
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,250
Speaker 1: In fact, my first wall screw ever was a slightly.

535
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:41,010
Speaker 1: It's a little bit edgy.

536
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,569
Speaker 1: I don't really hang it up anymore because I was given to me by the anime club as a gift.

537
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,627
Speaker 0: But I have this what you want it at a rap.

538
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:47,952
Speaker 1: No Remember I?

539
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:54,433
Speaker 1: I won the raffle and then they gave that to me and they gave me all of Ava to rent because it happened To be my birthday.

540
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:55,858
Speaker 0: I thought they didn't know.

541
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:56,862
Speaker 0: we asked for it.

542
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:59,973
Speaker 1: Like well, we asked for all of Ava and they said well It's your birthday.

543
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:00,977
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and it was.

544
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:03,045
Speaker 1: they even made me show my driver's license.

545
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,250
Speaker 1: They didn't believe it was my birthday.

546
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:04,954
Speaker 0: whatever.

547
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:12,790
Speaker 1: yeah, the things falling apart and filthy but The problem with a. well not the problem, but the first five episodes and all this stuff It's like a typical anime.

548
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:22,829
Speaker 1: So the show was designed and I think it was very purposeful to trick the average anime fan or just the robot fighting fan Whatever to watch this show.

549
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:33,390
Speaker 0: It goes in the shell does a lot of the same thing where they try to trick you into watching the show with their Violences and their boobies, but really then they bait and switch and they show you something else that they wanted you to see.

550
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:33,712
Speaker 0: Yeah,

551
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:49,272
Speaker 1: but with Ava, it's so calculated It's it's just enough robot show to get people going and actually all the people I know who like Ava a lot Are actually kind of turned off by the first few episodes and you got to kind of get them to watch until the point when the Switches.

552
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:59,070
Speaker 0: not only that but it's also so little robot show the people who are like super anti robot Will still be able to watch it because they like oh, it's not really a robot show.

553
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,585
Speaker 0: They don't really talk about the robot so much and they're barely even there.

554
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:09,770
Speaker 0: and you know Well fighting is just sort of like actual punching and kicking and not so much like, you know mechanical robot fighting.

555
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:21,314
Speaker 1: well plus I mean not to spoil but there is there's a point at which you find out just what these robots really are and I will admit that when I first saw Ava and you find out more about what's going on I had a chill.

556
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:29,110
Speaker 1: It was a very well executed scene and basically the show does the bait-and-switch and The show is not about the robot fighting at all.

557
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:45,998
Speaker 1: In fact at the end of the show and this is probably one of the biggest controversies ever in anime is that the show kind of stops right at the climax of everything that's going on and Doesn't really show you what happened.

558
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,570
Speaker 1: He doesn't show you the resolution to the plot.

559
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:51,040
Speaker 1: He basically says all right kids.

560
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,570
Speaker 1: I tricked you into watching my robot show.

561
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:57,686
Speaker 1: I slowly turned it into my commentary on the human condition.

562
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:11,187
Speaker 1: now I'm going to because I've already got you watching this far Tell you what I think and I'm going to do it in a very surreal very heavy-handed very straight-up way and People didn't like that so much.

563
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:14,580
Speaker 0: now people wanted to see their giant robot climax.

564
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:20,238
Speaker 0: Yes, so of course what I know did is stop taking his antidepressants.

565
00:44:20,479 --> 00:44:30,440
Speaker 0: Yes Well, basically, it's a 26 episode TV series and the final two episodes 25 and 26 are I knows message to you and there's not so much robotic going on now.

566
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:32,406
Speaker 1: I really want to avoid talking about the message.

567
00:44:32,446 --> 00:44:43,983
Speaker 1: that's for our other show on a device to say and I'm very open about this I cried at the final scene of Ava in the original TV show and I still think it is one of the best endings to An anime ever made.

568
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:46,793
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's fantastic as far as I'm concerned.

569
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:51,874
Speaker 0: Well, basically people Unlike rim really didn't go for that.

570
00:44:51,914 --> 00:44:53,120
Speaker 0: They wanted to see their robots.

571
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,910
Speaker 0: So he said he said no fuck you.

572
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,355
Speaker 0: and then he said no fuck you.

573
00:44:57,676 --> 00:44:58,880
Speaker 0: and then he said no fuck you.

574
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,490
Speaker 0: But then one day someone said what about money?

575
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:05,700
Speaker 0: money exists and he says fuck I need that.

576
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:08,879
Speaker 0: How can I eat if I don't have that yen over there?

577
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, because Ava did so poorly before the move.

578
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,415
Speaker 1: I know right got every money.

579
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:14,238
Speaker 0: So what he did?

580
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,004
Speaker 0: he said fine I need some yen's.

581
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:20,139
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go and I'm gonna make the end that you fuckers wanted to see.

582
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:47,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he went and he made episode 25 and 26 Again, he made replacement episodes and he passed them off as the event end to Evangelion the Evangelion movie You know and the episode the remake of episode 25 is called air and the remake of episode 26 is called a pure heart for you And that's why we refer to it as air and a pure heart for you Because it's the two episode titles with the word and in the middle.

583
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:49,513
Speaker 1: now funny little story.

584
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:52,300
Speaker 1: way back before there were internet fan subs.

585
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:54,954
Speaker 1: I there's a fan server called V kill.

586
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:58,928
Speaker 1: I really like that but VK ll yes, not VK I ll.

587
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,593
Speaker 1: yeah, I guess there might be.

588
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:03,000
Speaker 0: I failed that searching for him on the internet many times.

589
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:09,056
Speaker 1: I did not realize he lacked the eye and I got all the Sailor Moon and a bunch of other stuff from these people and They were really good.

590
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:16,500
Speaker 1: But I didn't know about Ava and he had this thing called end of Evangelion and I. it looked like a standalone movie.

591
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:22,620
Speaker 1: So I got it and I watched it and I didn't know what it was and it was really weird and it disturbed me.

592
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:24,589
Speaker 1: So I showed it to all my friends.

593
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,700
Speaker 1: they were like wow what's with all the religious?

594
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:27,952
Speaker 1: this is just really creepy.

595
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:36,433
Speaker 1: and Then we all found out that there was a show and that basically ruined the whole show for us and to this day None of them will forgive me for that.

596
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:39,428
Speaker 1: Yeah I also have to say it's watching that first.

597
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,680
Speaker 1: really put the rest of the show in this totally different perspective.

598
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, the the air and a pure heart for you is is kind of fucked up.

599
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:49,542
Speaker 0: It's all.

600
00:46:49,663 --> 00:47:00,220
Speaker 0: in some ways it's even more fucked up than the crazy ending he made in the first place I think but in other ways is less fucked up because it has it shows you quite literally what's going on.

601
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,345
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, there it is.

602
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:04,600
Speaker 0: I mean here except for the part where he shows the empty real-life movie theater.

603
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, that gets weird.

604
00:47:05,685 --> 00:47:09,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then that's that swing that just keeps swinging back and forth for like 20 minutes.

605
00:47:09,683 --> 00:47:11,559
Speaker 1: It's actually like a minute, but it feels like forever.

606
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:33,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean the difference between the original ending in the movies in terms of plot is that you know the show stops at episode 24 and then 25 and 26 basically are Like what's going on in the final care like in one of the main characters heads at the end of the show and even shows you Flashes of stills from what happened in the real world.

607
00:47:34,512 --> 00:47:37,079
Speaker 1: and the message is basically, you know, what?

608
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,680
Speaker 1: Yes Look, here's what happened.

609
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:46,393
Speaker 1: It shows shots of you know, certain people dead or things happening and the message is basically by now You should realize that you shouldn't care what happened.

610
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:54,520
Speaker 1: what actually physically happens Doesn't matter if you care about seeing what actually happened in the real world and what the end of this plot was.

611
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:56,496
Speaker 1: Then you miss the point of my anime.

612
00:47:56,758 --> 00:48:01,081
Speaker 1: granted I can't fault many people for missing the point of the anime because it's a little bit obtuse But

613
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:03,308
Speaker 0: a little bit up to a little bit little bit quite

614
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:12,560
Speaker 1: obtuse, but and it's really I like it the movies Show physically while this character is in his head, you know kind of exploring.

615
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:13,624
Speaker 1: Well, what am I?

616
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:15,229
Speaker 1: and what does it mean to be a human?

617
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:18,560
Speaker 1: and why is there this pain of separation from other humans?

618
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,906
Speaker 1: But is it better to be all that stuff?

619
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:32,356
Speaker 1: The movie is here's what happened when the giant robots fought the other giant robot yeah, and all the physical stuff and whether or not the Armageddon happens and what happens as a result of that.

620
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:42,811
Speaker 1: but the real Answers to what the movies were was Anno basically standing there with his two middle fingers in the air saying Alright assholes you wanted to see what happened.

621
00:48:43,112 --> 00:48:45,460
Speaker 1: I didn't want to show you but you asked for it.

622
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,555
Speaker 0: So here it is fuck you and not only fuck you but uh-huh.

623
00:48:49,675 --> 00:48:50,558
Speaker 0: I got your yen.

624
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:52,849
Speaker 1: Yes It's like you like those characters.

625
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,000
Speaker 1: Well, wait till you see what I do to them all.

626
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's other.

627
00:48:56,604 --> 00:48:57,748
Speaker 0: there's uh the movie.

628
00:48:57,788 --> 00:49:00,437
Speaker 0: when we say the movie we mean the replacement episodes.

629
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:01,340
Speaker 0: Aaron a pure heart for you.

630
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:13,958
Speaker 0: there are other things like Evangelion death in her birth and revival of Evangelion and all this other Movies different that remakes with added scenes and stuff like that and I really can't tell them apart.

631
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,079
Speaker 0: and Honestly, you don't really need to watch any of those.

632
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:24,982
Speaker 0: All you need to watch is the 26 episode TV series and then the two replacement episodes for 25 and 26.

633
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:26,067
Speaker 0: Don't watch anything else.

634
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:28,880
Speaker 0: It's probably just a waste of your time now my recommendation.

635
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:33,499
Speaker 1: But this is entirely just my recommendation and you don't have to follow it at all.

636
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:40,040
Speaker 1: But if you have never seen Evangelion before I would recommend that you watch the first 24 episodes and then stop.

637
00:49:40,642 --> 00:50:05,255
Speaker 1: Watch the movies now see what happens in the like in the end of the show and watch that ending and then Watch the last two episodes from the TV series because they kind of both say similar things But they kind of take two different tacks on it And I think that the real ending well not the real ending the first ending the original show Will leave a much better taste in your mouth and it'll

638
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:06,360
Speaker 0: also make more sense.

639
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:12,880
Speaker 1: Yes It's kind of tears of joy at understanding what the show is all about versus just sitting there with your mouth open going.

640
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:14,599
Speaker 1: What the fuck was that?

641
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:24,211
Speaker 1: Yeah now in terms of the show itself It's animated pretty well Especially considering when it came out and there are some extremely beautiful scenes in this.

642
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,735
Speaker 1: the soundtrack is fantastic.

643
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:27,300
Speaker 1: The voice acting is really good.

644
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,737
Speaker 1: There's a lot of big names in this.

645
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:33,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I've heard that the dub is actually not so bad but I still wouldn't watch it.

646
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,262
Speaker 1: It's not.

647
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:38,720
Speaker 1: it's about as good as all the dubs back then were which means kind of better than the dubs now.

648
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it was done by the.

649
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:42,298
Speaker 0: you know is day 80 V in the 90s.

650
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,619
Speaker 0: So whatever a TV was like in the 90s, that's what this was like.

651
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,880
Speaker 1: yep, and I gotta say they're the sit like the symbolism and the scenes and the way a lot of the.

652
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:53,860
Speaker 1: There's so much symbolism in the show.

653
00:50:53,860 --> 00:51:06,458
Speaker 1: It's kind of love Gutena where it just hits you over the head constantly, but I guess unlike Gutena It doesn't get crazy to the point of there's a flashing hand with the finger Pointing at the symbolic thing on the screen to make sure you don't miss it.

654
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:26,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of weird cuz it's not like, you know, they tell a completely normal story but there is a hidden meaning that is hidden but doesn't interfere because the symbolism does sort of interfere and they do a lot of scenes which are just Symbolic and not literal and you know, they are and sometimes you can decipher them and sometimes you can't.

655
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:32,531
Speaker 1: there's a lot of allegories Evangelion and a lot of the symbolism I think is very like.

656
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:40,320
Speaker 1: it doesn't say it doesn't hit you over the head so much It's more that it it kind of enhances the scene or adds a little something to your perception like there's a scene.

657
00:51:40,801 --> 00:52:16,700
Speaker 1: I think this is the best example where Gen Dao kind of the leader of all this business is sitting at his desk and It pans out to him at his desk and the way he's sitting at it with the shadow behind him His desk and him cast a shadow on the floor that is pretty much straight-up a Star of David and Simultaneously, there is this shadow from the cross beams of the window and as the camera moves the cross beams form across over his shoulder And coupled with what he is saying and kind of his Force or what he is doing or his what he does in the plot and why he is important.

658
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:21,180
Speaker 1: It actually adds a lot especially if you know anything about Judeo-Christian mythology.

659
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:27,140
Speaker 1: In fact, I would recommend that you read up a little bit on Judeo-Christian mythology and the Dead Sea Scrolls.

660
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:29,429
Speaker 1: The show will make a lot more sense if you do.

661
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll show you a lot of things and you might say Oh, it's the tree of life.

662
00:52:33,405 --> 00:52:34,369
Speaker 0: Oh, it's the Star of David.

663
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:37,120
Speaker 0: But what that means, I mean you'll be like God.

664
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,939
Speaker 0: It's the Jew symbol.

665
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:39,738
Speaker 0: But yeah, but you don't know any more than that.

666
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:43,320
Speaker 0: Then a lot of things will be completely lost on you that they're trying to say.

667
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:55,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean if you read about especially the Kabbalah which while it's obviously not true It's really interesting stuff and it's it's kind of neat and you'll get Ava a lot more if you've read about that at all Yeah, I guess that's you know.

668
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:11,040
Speaker 0: another reason why a lot of people are sort of you know say they don't like Ava so much because even if they're the kind of people who like symbolic meaningful existential kind of stuff this sort of requires like this base knowledge and You're a lot of attention.

669
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:20,779
Speaker 0: You had to pay attention to everything and every second and every single thing on the screen In order to get all the pieces and it's hard work, it's not like easy to watch and get it.

670
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:29,098
Speaker 1: It's very difficult, but unlike some shows like utenna no matter how hard you try You're not gonna figure out what's going on until the very end.

671
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:41,600
Speaker 1: with Ava you can get a very good idea if you just pay attention and if you watch the show with the mission of I Want to know what's actually going on You'll have a pretty good sense of what's going on near the like as it goes on.

672
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:50,265
Speaker 0: Because even even though everyone talks about how crazy it is most of the show is pretty straightforward like There's an angel coming.

673
00:53:50,305 --> 00:53:51,309
Speaker 0: Hey, we're in school.

674
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:53,075
Speaker 0: Hey, there's a robot.

675
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:54,560
Speaker 0: Hey, should I go in the robot?

676
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:54,981
Speaker 0: I don't know.

677
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:56,666
Speaker 0: you go in the robot instead this time.

678
00:53:56,686 --> 00:53:59,776
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not doing so well in this robot fight.

679
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:00,699
Speaker 0: Oh, she's hot.

680
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:02,923
Speaker 0: It's.

681
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:04,472
Speaker 0: most of it is straightforward.

682
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:13,876
Speaker 0: during the you know First half of the TV series for like 16 episodes everything will make sense complete sense like oh he's doing that now All right.

683
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:40,510
Speaker 1: Now I'd like to talk more about the show But honestly, I really don't want to spoil anything and I don't want to any more so than we already have kind of poison the well of how you're going to take Ava because much like all the shows like this there are a lot of ways to take it a lot of ways to interpret it and I really don't want anyone to watch this show having some sort of preconceived notion as to what the show is trying to say Because I'd like you to at least come to your own conclusion before you hear what we have to say about it.

684
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:47,572
Speaker 0: Yeah I think what it comes down to is whether you like this show or if you hate the show and you think it's the worst Show ever.

685
00:54:47,592 --> 00:54:53,930
Speaker 0: It's such a significant show at least in its influence on current animes and animes.

686
00:54:54,212 --> 00:55:05,265
Speaker 0: You know since you know in the later half of the 90s to today That if you are in any sort of anime fan whatsoever Even if you're only like shoujo and you hate robots and you hate all this kind of stuff.

687
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:06,510
Speaker 0: You should watch it.

688
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:12,430
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's it's sort of like a must watch Like if you watch movies you have to see citizen Kane, even if you don't like it you have to see it.

689
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:17,770
Speaker 1: It's like a law somewhere and luckily Ava is really easy to come by.

690
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:22,228
Speaker 1: There's a platinum thin pack and you want that you can get it for like 20 to 40 dollars.

691
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:23,419
Speaker 1: There's the whole show.

692
00:55:23,764 --> 00:55:30,450
Speaker 0: back in the day You had to buy a pile of VHS's or a pile of DVDs and ATV keeps re-releasing Ava in different formats.

693
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,633
Speaker 1: forget all of those.

694
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:40,164
Speaker 1: buy the platinum complete thin pack because one the platinum complete has it's totally Remastered and with this show it really matters.

695
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:41,128
Speaker 1: It's like night and day.

696
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:41,711
Speaker 0: Yep,

697
00:55:42,193 --> 00:56:04,810
Speaker 1: and two and this is one thing that bothers me about Ava in the platinum thin pack there are the directors cuts or the original cuts of like five or six episodes from the show and I watched all of those and I discovered something really it seems like all the things they cut out of the show Were the things that explained exactly what was going on in excruciating detail.

698
00:56:05,512 --> 00:56:15,558
Speaker 1: I watched this one episode and there's this organization called Garen that you kind of get the sense that they're important But they don't really explain exactly what that is And when they do it's really roundabout.

699
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:17,770
Speaker 1: in the director's cut version of that episode.

700
00:56:18,131 --> 00:56:18,673
Speaker 1: They're pretty much.

701
00:56:19,015 --> 00:56:22,488
Speaker 1: Garen was founded by this government to do this and this and this by these people.

702
00:56:22,548 --> 00:56:24,639
Speaker 1: on this date I was like, oh great.

703
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,569
Speaker 1: I really could have used that when I watched the real show.

704
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:29,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you get the platinum thin pack, it's cheap.

705
00:56:30,151 --> 00:56:35,730
Speaker 0: It's the whole show in a one tiny little box and it's really cheap and that's what you should buy.

706
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,722
Speaker 0: Don't bother buying any other DVD box sets.

707
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:40,510
Speaker 0: this probably, you know, you'll go to the store.

708
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:45,430
Speaker 0: There'll be some crazy expensive one for like three hundred dollars that comes with probably robots and things in there.

709
00:56:45,711 --> 00:56:46,373
Speaker 0: You don't want that.

710
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,458
Speaker 0: you could buy the real.

711
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,690
Speaker 0: I guess if you could find the old DVDs on eBay that might be cheap.

712
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:53,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, but make sure you don't get a bootleg if it's at a TV.

713
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,197
Speaker 0: It's not a bootleg if it's not from a TV.

714
00:56:56,819 --> 00:56:57,481
Speaker 0: It is a bootleg.

715
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:01,770
Speaker 1: and don't get VHS tapes for the love of God Yeah Yeah.

716
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,269
Speaker 0: VHS tapes kind of useless.

717
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:10,394
Speaker 0: plus if you get the probably main problem with getting this on VHS is you want the subtitles and it's probably harder to find the Subtitled VHS.

718
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:10,535
Speaker 0: is?

719
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:16,279
Speaker 0: I mean we had them all at RIT, but that's probably the only place Yeah, but I mean we really like the show.

720
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,810
Speaker 1: it's in our top ten possibly our top five easily.

721
00:57:19,473 --> 00:57:25,229
Speaker 1: Uh, I think the show has a lot to say and I think everyone out there Who is it all a fan of anime should at least give it a chance in?

722
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,283
Speaker 1: The future probably in a month or two.

723
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:29,230
Speaker 1: We want to give everyone time.

724
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:37,136
Speaker 1: We're gonna review the show for people who have already seen the show meaning spoilers and commentary Which means we have to watch it.

725
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:40,790
Speaker 0: So which I imagine we'll probably watch it in like August some point.

726
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, because well part of it we are ting this weekend.

727
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:44,568
Speaker 0: it's cons.

728
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:44,950
Speaker 0: cons.

729
00:57:45,372 --> 00:57:59,910
Speaker 1: We actually have several friends who have never seen Ava and one thing that one of my favorite things to do And I haven't been able to do this much since our IT is I love to watch one of those amazing shows With people who have never seen it because it's more fun to watch their reactions to certain scenes than to watch the show again.

730
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:02,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's cuz I've seen the show.

731
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,705
Speaker 0: Well, I haven't seen this in a while.

732
00:58:03,745 --> 00:58:04,950
Speaker 0: So I'm actually gonna be paying more attention.

733
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,757
Speaker 1: I've seen Ava about four times.

734
00:58:06,797 --> 00:58:07,660
Speaker 0: I've only seen it twice.

735
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:13,620
Speaker 0: But yeah it when guys if there's something I've seen 100 times like attack the gas station God, I can.

736
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,386
Speaker 0: I can't attack the gas station.

737
00:58:16,008 --> 00:58:16,570
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

738
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:20,426
Speaker 0: But if I just watch it, it doesn't do it for me because I've seen it like 20 times.

739
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:24,269
Speaker 0: but if there's even one person who hasn't seen it before.

740
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:31,427
Speaker 0: I Want to show it to them so badly and I'll sit there through the whole movie with them just to see if you know They attack only one seat.

741
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:38,345
Speaker 1: now at least for us that seems to be the mark of a good show like some shows are just So important to us or transcendent or whatever.

742
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:39,190
Speaker 1: that I mean.

743
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:43,205
Speaker 1: You know our the way we talk about Netflix and fan subs and whatever most things we watch.

744
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:46,030
Speaker 1: we watch him once we throw them Away, we never want to see him again.

745
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,307
Speaker 1: We already got what we're getting out of it.

746
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:53,750
Speaker 1: But there's a few shows and a few things and movies that we end up just periodically watching like every now and then.

747
00:58:54,091 --> 00:58:54,532
Speaker 1: You know what?

748
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:55,878
Speaker 1: It's been about that time.

749
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,026
Speaker 1: We've got to watch eska flown a again.

750
00:58:58,046 --> 00:59:01,699
Speaker 1: It's the matrix Yeah, and Ava's one of those things.

751
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:09,210
Speaker 1: we perennially watch Ava again and again And I imagine that I'm going to watch Ava every few years off and on for much of my life.

752
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:10,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm an old man.

753
00:59:10,642 --> 00:59:16,070
Speaker 0: I'll be sitting there I've read everything and seen every anime and whatever and I'll be like up seeing everything.

754
00:59:17,272 --> 00:59:18,180
Speaker 0: Watch that Ava again.

755
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,168
Speaker 0: All right.

756
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,656
Speaker 1: Sure Yeah, plus I mean Ava.

757
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:22,625
Speaker 1: really it stands up to the test of time.

758
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,854
Speaker 1: if Ava came out today I think it would do well.

759
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:26,259
Speaker 0: Oh, it'd do crazy.

760
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:28,587
Speaker 1: Well, especially considering a lot of what's out there now.

761
00:59:29,049 --> 00:59:33,190
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, the thing is it's definitely from you know, that older school of anime.

762
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,788
Speaker 0: They don't make anime in this genre anymore.

763
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:36,110
Speaker 0: Really?

764
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,430
Speaker 1: Well, they've tried and a lot of people say that Raza fon does what Ava tried to do better.

765
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:41,915
Speaker 0: I watch Raza fon.

766
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:48,857
Speaker 0: it is definitely in the same genre, but it's also definitely different even though at times They're directly poking fun at Ava.

767
00:59:49,238 --> 00:59:52,589
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we could actually do a whole episode in Raza fon slash Ava.

768
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:57,789
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, you know we could do a whole episode on just all the shows that pay homage to or otherwise make fun of Ava.

769
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:11,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, if you if you like Raza Ava Ava, you should probably watch Raza fon Yeah and also if you like both of those shows watch big-o solely so that you can watch big-o - and You might think what are you crazy?

770
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:15,630
Speaker 1: because big-o is about a giant robot who punches other giant robots in the face.

771
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:16,880
Speaker 0: That's why big-o is awesome.

772
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:24,928
Speaker 1: Big-o is one of my favorite anime But seriously big-o much like Ava takes a turn and goes the direction you wouldn't expect Ava with Batman.

773
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:29,009
Speaker 1: Yes All Right, I think we're done.

774
