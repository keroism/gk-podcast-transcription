1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,468
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday August 8th.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,431
Speaker 1: I'm Ren.

3
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:15,160
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,620
Speaker 0: Tonight we preview a brand new anime bakano.

5
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:25,388
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:32,232
Speaker 0: So it uh rained overnight.

7
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:34,280
Speaker 1: It didn't even rain that much.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,307
Speaker 1: I mean it just rained well up here.

9
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,230
Speaker 0: didn't rain that much?

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,725
Speaker 0: down further south of us it rained quite a bit Yeah But it wasn't like.

11
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:53,035
Speaker 1: you know OMG this water All the cars are like swimming around and you know you're up to your neck in water And this is the sewage is coming up out of the sewer or anything like that.

12
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:56,320
Speaker 0: so apparently according to you There's no sliding scale of it rained a lot.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,760
Speaker 0: It's either torrential floods or nothing pretty much as far as I'm concerned.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:11,144
Speaker 1: Okay, well I can walk around and with my umbrella and be like doo doo doo doo That's rain, and then if I can walk around without an umbrella Then it.

15
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,391
Speaker 0: well I find out rain.

16
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:20,120
Speaker 0: when it rained you weren't up And you didn't have an umbrella But it must have rained pretty hard because uh all the subways in New York City got completely fucked.

17
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:24,367
Speaker 1: That's not because it rained too much That's because the subways really suck at handling rain.

18
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:29,264
Speaker 0: the thing is while the subways generally do suck at handling rain usually no matter How bad it rains.

19
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:32,940
Speaker 0: only the Lexington Avenue line goes out and everything else is usually okay?

20
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:42,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean I got to the city today and I go down into the subway not knowing and there were portents of doom well before.

21
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:44,700
Speaker 0: Because I remember I get to the train station.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,337
Speaker 0: I left early because it was wet outside from the rain and because my bike is broken.

23
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:59,480
Speaker 0: and by broken I just mean I have a hole in a tube and my patch kit is so old that the adhesive doesn't work anymore and No store anywhere near our house sells bicycle tubes.

24
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,280
Speaker 0: So I was gonna order it on Amazon.

25
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:05,555
Speaker 0: But for all that I'll just wait for the weekend and drive to the other bike shop.

26
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:15,055
Speaker 0: because last weekend We tried to go to the bike shop to learn that in the time between the last time I had gone and Going this time it had gone out of business and emptied.

27
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:16,080
Speaker 1: It's what happens.

28
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that is what happens businesses.

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,416
Speaker 0: Just suddenly go out of business and disappear without warning.

30
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:22,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what they do.

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,469
Speaker 1: I mean you don't go out of business with warning.

32
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,096
Speaker 0: You know yeah, you do a lot of places.

33
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:27,517
Speaker 0: when they go out of business They're like all right.

34
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,660
Speaker 0: We're going out of business time for that.

35
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:34,663
Speaker 1: Go out of business on purpose and not out of business because you sucked I don't know.

36
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:36,513
Speaker 0: maybe someone at leprosy or something and

37
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:37,337
Speaker 1: I don't know

38
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:49,696
Speaker 0: yeah But suffice to say I had to rollerblade to work which usually is kind of awesome because I really like rollerblading despite the fact that Unlike the Midwest where I grew up there as far as I'm concerned there are no sidewalks.

39
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:52,910
Speaker 0: in most of New York There are things that look like sidewalks.

40
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:56,449
Speaker 0: you can walk on them pretty well But they're not really sidewalks.

41
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,560
Speaker 0: if you try to rollerblade on them you just fall on your face.

42
00:02:58,841 --> 00:02:59,262
Speaker 1: Well, that's cuz.

43
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,446
Speaker 1: they're digga digga digga digga digga.

44
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,957
Speaker 1: They're not like these big wide smooth concrete things.

45
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:04,158
Speaker 0: Well.

46
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:04,700
Speaker 0: They're concrete.

47
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,010
Speaker 0: They're just narrow cracked and dirty.

48
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're meant for walking.

49
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,420
Speaker 1: They're not meant for anything else.

50
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:12,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the other problem is that I don't know what the laws are here.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,834
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if rollerbladers are pedestrians or vehicles.

52
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 1: Why don't you look it up on the Internet?

53
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,908
Speaker 0: I didn't get a chance to.

54
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:23,335
Speaker 0: I thought about it while I was rollerblading home And then we came home to find that the website was down.

55
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:24,382
Speaker 0: and now here We are.

56
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:30,188
Speaker 1: yeah apparently someone DDoS not our website But the machine that our website is on.

57
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,620
Speaker 0: my guess is that someone else on sharing our machine?

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,843
Speaker 0: Did something.

59
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,209
Speaker 1: it might not even been our machine.

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,094
Speaker 1: It could have been anyone.

61
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:46,889
Speaker 0: in the whole data center there I get the impression that someone did something untoward to draw the ire of someone else and that person was summarily removed from Linode.

62
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,080
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much Yeah.

63
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:57,475
Speaker 0: So I left really early because I had to rollerblade and if anyone of you out there is never Rollerbladed rollerblading on wet terrain is pretty much a death sentence.

64
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:02,252
Speaker 0: unless you have special wheels You're just gonna die especially if there's hills or grit or anything.

65
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:04,722
Speaker 1: really I wouldn't think that it would be so bad You lose.

66
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:09,280
Speaker 0: travel thing is the more traction you get with rollerblade wheels the more they wear out.

67
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:23,447
Speaker 0: And I have long run wheels that are really really hard, and they're great for speed skating, but When it's wet they just kind of slide left and right and if you're going too fast You'll just kind of fall over suddenly And you can't prevent it.

68
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:29,040
Speaker 0: because when you try to stick a foot out to kind of catch yourself and go in a different direction It just doesn't catch and you just slide.

69
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:31,166
Speaker 0: It's kind of awesome alright.

70
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,993
Speaker 1: Can you grab onto a tree or anything.

71
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:34,880
Speaker 0: not really you're going too fast.

72
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,234
Speaker 0: It's more a matter of you can't regain control because you can't grip the ground with your wheels in order to turn Because you have to turn to change your momentum.

73
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,059
Speaker 0: You're just gonna fall over.

74
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's complicated.

75
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:49,287
Speaker 0: rollerblading is not as easy as a lot of people make it out to be But it's not as difficult as people anyway.

76
00:04:49,749 --> 00:05:01,960
Speaker 0: the point is I ended up at the train station earlier than I expected and There was all these warnings like warning trains will not be delayed here But may run into substantial delays in the Bronx due to flood conditions.

77
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:11,120
Speaker 1: I didn't hear any such message when I got to the train station Which was not much later after you, but later they announced it three times pretty spaced apart.

78
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got there later than you, but not much later, and then they announced it on the train that I wrote.

79
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,251
Speaker 0: I don't know were you on the same train as me.

80
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:17,694
Speaker 0: No.

81
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:18,137
Speaker 1: I was on.

82
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:21,060
Speaker 1: I said I was on a later train, but not much later train.

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
Speaker 1: I was on that like thinking in bag for eight.

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,633
Speaker 0: I was on the tree out like the Krazy Express that leaves before us.

85
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:39,359
Speaker 0: like before the train we usually take Was actually there until almost right before the other train left because there were delays further down the road Uh-huh, but luckily they must have fixed all that stuff well before Scott got into the city and Emily got into the city.

86
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,380
Speaker 1: like Maybe a half hour later.

87
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,380
Speaker 0: I think all the ass early trains that the Krazy Commuters take got held up who knows.

88
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:50,660
Speaker 0: But luckily my train gets off well before there's any chance of flooding so I never really have a problem.

89
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:57,709
Speaker 0: But yeah the subways were totally fucked and the buses were then fucked as everyone tried to take them and a bunch of streets in Midtown were closed.

90
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,640
Speaker 0: and Randomly unrelated to all that one subway station was closed due to a police investigation.

91
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,480
Speaker 1: And yeah, I mean I got to the city on the train which is perfectly normal.

92
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,288
Speaker 1: I didn't hear any about any trouble.

93
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,156
Speaker 1: It wasn't you know out.

94
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,180
Speaker 1: I'd been outside.

95
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,926
Speaker 1: It wasn't really that wet.

96
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:16,339
Speaker 1: it looked like it rained last night, and the Sun was out, and it was hot.

97
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,255
Speaker 1: But it didn't look like there was a flood or anything.

98
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,046
Speaker 1: there was some puddles And that's about it.

99
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,454
Speaker 1: and then down in the subway They're like there are no trains going in either direction.

100
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,357
Speaker 0: It was great.

101
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:38,255
Speaker 0: I saw on notices They were like the Lexington Avenue for line is not running between like Brooklyn Bridge and 86th Street Which is pretty much the entirety of its useful length for us.

102
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:49,439
Speaker 1: no the message I heard was like between the in the Bronx and in Brooklyn And I was like okay, there are no stops anywhere because the train goes from the Bronx.

103
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,185
Speaker 1: So and you know so it's not stopping.

104
00:06:53,245 --> 00:07:01,834
Speaker 1: It's not even in Manhattan, so I Basically, I'm like okay I will take the s to Times Square, and then I will take the NQ RW to work.

105
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,565
Speaker 0: Yeah Because the four five six they like.

106
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:13,172
Speaker 0: you know the the green train as a lot of people who aren't from New York College It tends to flood in a few places pretty often when it rains.

107
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,804
Speaker 0: so if it's down people just kind of alright Whatever and take another subway.

108
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:22,724
Speaker 1: Yep, so I was gonna take the NQ RW, so I went over there, and I took the s Was not running.

109
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:25,392
Speaker 1: there was the three s trains were just sitting there.

110
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,180
Speaker 1: now the s train is a train that goes Maybe a couple miles.

111
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:29,883
Speaker 1: It's like the.

112
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:34,200
Speaker 0: not even it goes a distance that I routinely walk because it's not worth the hassle.

113
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,532
Speaker 1: It's like the shortest train ride ever.

114
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:39,600
Speaker 1: it goes from Grand Central to Times Square.

115
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,415
Speaker 1: It's like a five block train.

116
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,060
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of them.

117
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,649
Speaker 0: They just go back and forth 24/7 just back and forth.

118
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,972
Speaker 1: not even it's like it's like a two or three Avenue block train.

119
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:49,919
Speaker 1: it's really short.

120
00:07:50,382 --> 00:08:01,100
Speaker 1: But if you want to go from Times Central Times Square to Grand Central Yes, if you want to go to either of those two places from the other place in a hurry There's the s train and it's actually kind of crowded.

121
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,472
Speaker 1: They have three of them that just go back and forth all the time and they were just sitting there not moving And I was like whoa.

122
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,260
Speaker 1: that's amazing.

123
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:12,476
Speaker 1: They can't even like suck up the water or drain the water out of this little tiny train track.

124
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:13,640
Speaker 1: That's very short.

125
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,196
Speaker 1: What the hell?

126
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,656
Speaker 1: So I took the seven train which makes the same trip and that wasn't too bad.

127
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:23,196
Speaker 1: taking the seven train I get the Times Square, so I'm looking for the NQ RW.

128
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:23,939
Speaker 1: I get over there.

129
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:32,404
Speaker 1: It's pretty crowded this NQ RW and an N train comes and people are like squeezing into the N train and I'm like I will wait for the next train

130
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:33,768
Speaker 0: and I wait

131
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:40,919
Speaker 1: and I wait and I wait anyway anyway and an N train comes And I try to get into it, but that's not happening.

132
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:44,680
Speaker 0: See, it's one thing when you see a train in this crowded and you think you know what?

133
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,580
Speaker 0: I'll wait for the next one or I'll wait and take the local or something.

134
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:55,654
Speaker 0: But every now and then you run into a situation where there's a train That even if you wanted to get onto it you could not physically push your way past the door.

135
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,571
Speaker 1: Yep, so I'm like, okay I know what I'll do.

136
00:08:58,692 --> 00:08:59,360
Speaker 1: I'll be all clever.

137
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:02,317
Speaker 1: I'll take the queue because they're all these people trying to get NRWs.

138
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:09,668
Speaker 1: I was gonna get the queue right so I'm waiting over by the queue and it's it's nice You know on the other side of the platform, it's pretty quiet.

139
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,959
Speaker 1: Everyone's wants the NRWs and I wait and I wait anyway.

140
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:13,280
Speaker 1: anyway.

141
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,609
Speaker 1: Anyway a long time.

142
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:23,540
Speaker 1: I wait so long That there's people lining up the stairs like the platform is full and people are lined up up above the platform elsewhere.

143
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,530
Speaker 0: No, one of those people thinking obviously there's a problem.

144
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,557
Speaker 0: They might as well go take a cab.

145
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:32,629
Speaker 1: So No, Q comes no R's come no W's come.

146
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:36,464
Speaker 0: eventually another N comes, you know in a situation like that You kind of wait.

147
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,000
Speaker 0: you figure like maybe this is the apocalypse in the end.

148
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:48,620
Speaker 0: No, no, no, cuz you're sitting there and eventually a train just gonna go by full of skeletons or something But no kind of like those creepy-ass garbage trains that go by every now and then at night.

149
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,095
Speaker 1: Yes, anyway one of those no.

150
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:55,655
Speaker 1: So what happens is this end comes and of course people get off the end.

151
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:56,758
Speaker 1: so I go aha.

152
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:57,520
Speaker 1: Here's my chance.

153
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:08,081
Speaker 1: I got with the people who were getting off the end and use their momentum to get the hell out of there and I went up and I got a cab and I went to work for $15.

154
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:11,320
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah, cuz I wasn't gonna walk all that way in that deathly heat.

155
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:16,015
Speaker 0: Meanwhile because I was in I had my own adventure because I avoided all transit problems.

156
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:27,620
Speaker 0: now had I driven to work I would have been fucked because New York City regardless of the subway problems There are you know highways and freeways and then there are these things called parkways.

157
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:32,867
Speaker 0: Now in New York a parkway means that you can't have any commercial traffic on it So it means pretty much in all the Northeast.

158
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,800
Speaker 0: it was probably made a hundred fucking years ago.

159
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:39,660
Speaker 0: It's probably windy with dangerous old rusty guardrails.

160
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:45,700
Speaker 0: It's probably nothing like a real freeway and almost all of them followed a river of some kind.

161
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:54,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, parkways are generally like these highways that are just for cars and they're used a lot for Commuting and such even though they shouldn't be like the taconic.

162
00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:08,792
Speaker 0: one of the biggest commuter roads around here was made back in the day So that people who have owned cars who happen to own a car in New York City Could have a nice place to drive like a fun windy Mountain road to drive on to go up and picnic in the upstate parts.

163
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:10,800
Speaker 0: and now it's a commuter road.

164
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,572
Speaker 0: So it's still windy and now it.

165
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:13,680
Speaker 0: that just makes it deadly.

166
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:18,280
Speaker 0: Yep, but they all follow these rivers that theoretically are supposed to take the water away.

167
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,779
Speaker 0: But those rivers over the years have clogged up to the point that they're basically just trickles.

168
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 0: I mean I can spit more than these things have water in them and when it rains the parkways just turn into the rivers.

169
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:34,780
Speaker 0: And every time it rains at all my commute turns into like this four-hour nightmare.

170
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,749
Speaker 0: So now that I take the train, I just got to work.

171
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,234
Speaker 0: No problem.

172
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:39,997
Speaker 0: I get off the train.

173
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:40,900
Speaker 0: weather's fine.

174
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:48,900
Speaker 0: I start walking up the mile to the to run my work up this mountain and Suddenly starts pouring rain and I realized that I don't have an umbrella pun.

175
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,110
Speaker 0: So I hid in the woods for 10 minutes.

176
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,260
Speaker 0: the rain stopped and then I continued on my quest.

177
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:54,004
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

178
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,160
Speaker 0: I got to work and no one was fucking there because they were all stuck in traffic.

179
00:11:57,381 --> 00:12:03,720
Speaker 1: Apparently if I would have gotten to work on time Someone said that there was basically no one there and it was a ghost town.

180
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:09,391
Speaker 1: So I guess it's kind of okay that I got to work late and then I was gonna go home from work And I was.

181
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:13,472
Speaker 1: you know I went to the website and they said the subway still isn't working and I'm like, what the fuck.

182
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:19,015
Speaker 1: so I go and I'm like Okay, let's see what the bus is like and I could take this bus.

183
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,020
Speaker 0: Did you take the bus?

184
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,048
Speaker 0: No, I've never taken a bus in the city.

185
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:28,276
Speaker 1: subway started working again, and there was no one down there And I just took the subway back to the train station.

186
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:28,718
Speaker 1: it went home.

187
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:37,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, the subway just suddenly started working and I got on it before it became stupidly crowded full of people who realized it was working Again, right?

188
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:40,319
Speaker 0: So technically that wasn't a tangent because it's Dave and Joe like to make fun of.

189
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,669
Speaker 0: I guess That was the opening kind of free flows.

190
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,614
Speaker 0: Talk about our day.

191
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:58,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is As bad as it is in New York City when shit goes wrong when everything works It's not so bad, which is honestly 99% of the time Yeah, but it's like the system just can't handle anything going wrong at all.

192
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:04,270
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of the problem Lee at capacity is just the fact that you know New York City is a big place.

193
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:11,957
Speaker 0: A lot of people live there and People keep moving there, but most of the subways were made, you know, 50 60 years ago.

194
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:16,759
Speaker 0: Well more than that Mm-hmm, and a lot of them haven't changed very much over the years.

195
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:25,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there's there's this running gag in the city of the Second Avenue subway that is never gonna get built But they're actually working on building it now and it'll be done and I think 2013.

196
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,215
Speaker 1: the thing that.

197
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,344
Speaker 0: so if Quetzalcoatl doesn't come We'll get a new subway.

198
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:39,299
Speaker 1: The thing that just bothers me is it seems like there are some extreme measures that could be taken to fix a situation like this and then no one bothers to take them or that they're.

199
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,180
Speaker 1: you know, It's logistically impossible.

200
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:50,140
Speaker 0: There was a vote that we actually voted on in this area a while ago Whether or not to spend a whole bunch of money to make transit like a million times better and fix all the current problems.

201
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:54,460
Speaker 0: I voted yes, and most New Yorkers voted no because they're dumbasses.

202
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:02,257
Speaker 0: Good job thing is though that we can't complain because honestly New York City has some of the best public transit in the world like hands-down.

203
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:04,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty sad.

204
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,580
Speaker 1: Actually, I would if public transit was awesome.

205
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,360
Speaker 1: They'd be like whoosh whoosh whoosh and you'd have to be riding these nice comfortable.

206
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,517
Speaker 0: Hey for me public transit's awesome because I get to ride the nice new fancy mature North trains.

207
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:16,200
Speaker 0: I take the local.

208
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:20,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still you know, it's this nice air-conditioned car, it's all clean.

209
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:22,749
Speaker 0: the seats are big They got nice dividers by the heads.

210
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,559
Speaker 0: They don't have to smell or see the person next to me.

211
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:26,893
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's you know, it's not every.

212
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:38,680
Speaker 0: I also learned recently It is against the rules of New York City to occupy more than one seat on a subway no matter the circumstances Uh-huh, and I've seen some people who merely by their girth took up two or three seats.

213
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:41,280
Speaker 0: So technically those people can be kicked off the subway.

214
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,285
Speaker 0: I find that hilarious.

215
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:43,209
Speaker 1: that isn't enforced.

216
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,660
Speaker 1: like you're not allowed to walk between the subway cars people do it.

217
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:49,014
Speaker 0: Thing is I've never seen someone who wasn't a shady person do that.

218
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:50,520
Speaker 1: I seen punk kids do it.

219
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always punk kids doing something shady or causing trouble.

220
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:56,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, or it's those DVD sellers.

221
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know those those bootleg sellers that wander around the subway trying like DVD DVD.

222
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:01,260
Speaker 0: you want DVD?

223
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,956
Speaker 1: Yep, those guys those guys are all right, though.

224
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:15,260
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so if you couldn't tell we're stalling for time because there's just no goddamn anime news worth talking about Anime manga or comic news at all kind of sucks.

225
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,960
Speaker 0: Well, nothing we care about at all and nothing any of you would care about.

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,630
Speaker 0: I mean Otakon officially released their numbers But a lot of people went to Otakon.

227
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:24,658
Speaker 0: Otakon counts differently from other cons.

228
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,068
Speaker 0: We talked about this last year and the year before.

229
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:28,729
Speaker 1: Yeah.

230
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:29,692
Speaker 1: All right.

231
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:31,937
Speaker 1: So here's my crap-ass news.

232
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:32,298
Speaker 1: You ready?

233
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:32,940
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

234
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:38,880
Speaker 1: So, okay My news isn't the news itself because the news itself is not what I care about.

235
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,520
Speaker 1: Right, and in fact the news is that I don't care about the news.

236
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:44,931
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's news because that's there would be old news, whatever.

237
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:45,753
Speaker 0: It's not news.

238
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,496
Speaker 0: It's geek nights.

239
00:15:47,078 --> 00:16:03,300
Speaker 1: So apparently All over all the nerds are getting excited because someone named Gugino Gugino is gonna be in the Watchmen movie is some character and I just I want to say that you know, I don't know who this person is or whatever.

240
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:14,560
Speaker 1: But I keep seeing lately a lot of these film news's and it seems like anytime There's even the slightest thing to say about a movie especially a movie that has anything to do with nerdiness, right?

241
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,666
Speaker 1: Everyone's just like OMG.

242
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:19,097
Speaker 1: Here's a possible cast.

243
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,614
Speaker 1: OMG Someone so is directing.

244
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:25,349
Speaker 0: such as you know that is a common pastime among nerds and geeks.

245
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,527
Speaker 0: whenever you think about what if they made a movie about I don't know Forgotten realms.

246
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:33,320
Speaker 0: the first thing people think is well who would play Elminster?

247
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,020
Speaker 0: And then they talk about it and the answer is obviously Ian McClellan.

248
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:50,207
Speaker 1: But yeah, but I mean this this explosive news about even the tiniest changes to movies especially when 90% of these things are it verified or or Confirmed or in a press release or and oh

249
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:50,468
Speaker 0: I can

250
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:54,843
Speaker 1: add something some nerd either came up with or dug up or some Tabloid person.

251
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:56,869
Speaker 0: I can answer why this happens pretty easily.

252
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:57,511
Speaker 0: one.

253
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:03,431
Speaker 0: The blogosphere is more reactionary than the Royalist during the French Revolution.

254
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:04,800
Speaker 1: It's not the blogosphere at all.

255
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,359
Speaker 1: It's like these non blog sort of movie website.

256
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,685
Speaker 0: well, no, that was just the first point.

257
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:16,400
Speaker 0: just in general why things like this happen - is the fact that because Generally muggles are not on the internet in force.

258
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,740
Speaker 0: I mean normal people non geeks not nerds people who aren't terribly motivated about the things that all of us care about.

259
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:32,520
Speaker 0: They use Google and Yahoo and whatever to find the website about Britney Spears and look at it and check their email and then Check the news in the weather and they don't really care about anything else on the internet.

260
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:40,793
Speaker 0: So the primary force of voice on the internet is People like us who care about these things a lot, but I know that's the thing.

261
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,760
Speaker 1: I who the fuck cares about this?

262
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:49,425
Speaker 1: I mean, oh, this is God who cares about your stupid video game news, but I'm saying like, okay Maybe I don't even know.

263
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,932
Speaker 1: is there gonna be a watch from the movie.

264
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:51,735
Speaker 1: There's no guarantee.

265
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:55,070
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a watch probably Probably right there.

266
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,158
Speaker 1: They're deciding a cast.

267
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:57,684
Speaker 1: You don't know.

268
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:58,792
Speaker 1: this is gonna be the final cast.

269
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,080
Speaker 1: this could change at any moment.

270
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,507
Speaker 1: We made the movie.

271
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:02,551
Speaker 1: is it on the screen?

272
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:04,400
Speaker 1: if not everything is just bullshit.

273
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:07,633
Speaker 1: It's bullshit until there's a movie in the movie theater.

274
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,200
Speaker 1: Wow posters on the walls.

275
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:11,488
Speaker 1: It's just bullshit crap to sort of.

276
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,632
Speaker 1: I don't know it.

277
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,880
Speaker 1: God what the fuck do you care?

278
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,014
Speaker 1: And why are you wasting your time paying attention to it?

279
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,360
Speaker 0: I pretty much disagree with you.

280
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,630
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a problem at all.

281
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,900
Speaker 0: I don't doesn't bother me people.

282
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,695
Speaker 1: It's a bullshit waste of time to pay attention to all these.

283
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:28,716
Speaker 1: you don't have to pay Rumors and crap, you don't have to pay attention to a fan.

284
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:29,380
Speaker 1: attention to it.

285
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,020
Speaker 1: The problem is I keep seeing it filling up my RSS another crap and I'm like get this shit out of here.

286
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:42,427
Speaker 1: I don't want to see stuff if it's not true a hundred percent final thing and it's not something important that matters Get it the fuck out here.

287
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:43,833
Speaker 1: I got care Scott.

288
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:44,716
Speaker 1: I shouldn't care either.

289
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:47,208
Speaker 0: I Think you're full of shit.

290
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,160
Speaker 1: You're full of shit cuz Michael is shit.

291
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,872
Speaker 0: Well, frankly one if you don't like what's in an RSS feed don't subscribe to it.

292
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:53,494
Speaker 1: I don't.

293
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,140
Speaker 1: I got some filters going on.

294
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:04,560
Speaker 0: Okay, and - I mean it's no different than what happens when a video game comes out, you know people bullshit - okay So what you're basically saying is people should never speculate on anything ever.

295
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,368
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying is that you shouldn't be.

296
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,720
Speaker 1: you know, there's nothing wrong with speculating.

297
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,094
Speaker 1: All right, you can sit around in your forum and say ooh, wouldn't this be cool.

298
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:13,400
Speaker 1: or ooh, wouldn't that this be cool?

299
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,966
Speaker 1: That's fine.

300
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:25,012
Speaker 1: You can I am with your friends You can sit down and have a discussion and you know, imagine things and have fun, but don't go posting news articles like People can post whatever they want freedom of speech.

301
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:27,360
Speaker 1: You can't don't be passing it off as news.

302
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:29,430
Speaker 0: How are they passing it off as news?

303
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,280
Speaker 0: I mean is what was the news Scott?

304
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,824
Speaker 0: What article is it that's bothering you?

305
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:36,375
Speaker 1: this particular seems like it is actually news.

306
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:41,174
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, oh But a lot of them aren't like what cuz.

307
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,380
Speaker 0: apparently this is news.

308
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,559
Speaker 0: They are in fact working on selecting a cast and if people are excited about that because they're interested in movies There's nothing wrong with that.

309
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:58,680
Speaker 0: I mean think about all the speculation that went on about what characters they're gonna be in Smash Brothers brawl and that filled up millions of RSS feeds and websites and people arguing about and I was tired of that shit.

310
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,894
Speaker 1: The only ones I care about are the ones that say, you know, I don't.

311
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:03,360
Speaker 1: actually I don't even care at all.

312
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,048
Speaker 0: I don't want to know who the characters are.

313
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:05,913
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter to me.

314
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,360
Speaker 1: I know the characters are gonna be good.

315
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,963
Speaker 1: What does it matter?

316
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:09,431
Speaker 0: which ones they are, you know what Scott?

317
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,139
Speaker 0: then those websites just aren't for you.

318
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,607
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying And I don't understand the people that the websites are for.

319
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:18,560
Speaker 1: why are you so interested in scrounging up all these useless tidbits?

320
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:24,600
Speaker 1: Information about something that doesn't exist yet and you have no control over that information.

321
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:26,445
Speaker 1: It's like what do you?

322
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:29,374
Speaker 1: I don't understand the point of it because it's interesting.

323
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:30,858
Speaker 0: people like to find out about things.

324
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:38,079
Speaker 0: if I'm looking forward to a movie or video game or something and there's news about that video game like some details about when it's gonna come out or

325
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,572
Speaker 1: When it's gonna come out as important or

326
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:49,308
Speaker 0: who's working on it What art they might have or maybe oh it's gonna be a rehash of this or there's gonna be extra levels or it's gonna have Online player all those rumors and stuff.

327
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,252
Speaker 0: I like that.

328
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,140
Speaker 0: I find it interesting and I write it upside.

329
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,649
Speaker 1: Well, what's the point in knowing that?

330
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,280
Speaker 1: I mean you're not gonna be able to change it.

331
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,819
Speaker 1: You're gonna find out when it comes out.

332
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,879
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's you're not gonna be able to make a decision about it until it actually comes out.

333
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:04,160
Speaker 1: So if I what's the point in knowing that information?

334
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,494
Speaker 1: So far in advance and collecting it bit by bit and I don't understand.

335
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,100
Speaker 0: What if you just got what if you just find it?

336
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,762
Speaker 0: Interesting.

337
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:12,106
Speaker 1: Why is it interesting?

338
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,470
Speaker 0: Why is anything interesting?

339
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:19,320
Speaker 0: if someone likes something and they want to seek out information about it Then that's their prerogative and I've had nothing wrong with that at all.

340
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:20,667
Speaker 1: I think it's guy.

341
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,900
Speaker 1: I just don't like all this stuff of like, you know.

342
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:33,145
Speaker 1: Hyping stuff up with these tidbits of information crap Rick in The only reason I would want to know about something like a video game or a movie is to make a decision as to whether To buy it or see it.

343
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,698
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sorry that the rest of the world is not as simple as you.

344
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,842
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

345
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:40,252
Speaker 1: rest of the world is frickin stupid following this shit?

346
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,880
Speaker 1: Like it's so important wasting their goddamn time Scott.

347
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,013
Speaker 0: I'm just absolutely surprised at these sheer amount of venom use that was.

348
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,683
Speaker 0: that was kind of a crazy rant You went on just now.

349
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:51,453
Speaker 1: is it really bothers me these people who?

350
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:53,180
Speaker 0: why would it bother you what other people like?

351
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,588
Speaker 1: It's not that it's what other people like.

352
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:58,080
Speaker 1: is that these people are like so crazed?

353
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,420
Speaker 1: How about things that aren't like substantial or real about this?

354
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:12,460
Speaker 1: It's like completely superficial useless pieces of information and they're like hanging on to it Like it's you know, actually like this humongous amazing news of some sort.

355
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:14,025
Speaker 0: How are they crazed?

356
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:15,531
Speaker 0: and is there any example of that?

357
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,618
Speaker 0: because you're just kind of saying stuff.

358
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:19,285
Speaker 1: right now I see these people.

359
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:22,700
Speaker 1: what people where nerds on forums and places.

360
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,514
Speaker 0: So it's no different than when we get excited about something.

361
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:26,780
Speaker 1: What do I get excited about?

362
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:37,124
Speaker 1: Well, maybe you just don't get excited about anything, but normal people I don't get excited about things until they're real until they exist until their final until it's something that actually matters Scott till it's.

363
00:22:37,244 --> 00:22:41,620
Speaker 0: I'll say that I got excited about the Firefly movie when it was not even a rumor.

364
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:46,036
Speaker 0: It was just a. they should make a Firefly movie and no one had said anything yet.

365
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:49,969
Speaker 0: and I was already excited Yeah, and I thought what our politics?

366
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,016
Speaker 0: the Democratic and the Republican primaries.

367
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:53,420
Speaker 0: I can't make any decisions yet.

368
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,940
Speaker 0: The primaries are a long long way off and nothing I do right now matters, but I'm still paying attention to the field.

369
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,487
Speaker 0: I'm still interested in what's going on.

370
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:03,080
Speaker 1: Notice how I don't pay attention to that at all until it matters.

371
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:10,587
Speaker 0: Yeah and what I'm saying is People can be interested in different things and people have different tastes and things and I think it's a waste of time to pay attention To shit.

372
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:11,199
Speaker 1: that don't matter.

373
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:12,931
Speaker 0: You mean shit.

374
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,220
Speaker 0: that doesn't matter, right?

375
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,970
Speaker 0: Unless you were using the word shit without an S on the end.

376
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,160
Speaker 0: somehow in the plural also that see.

377
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:21,374
Speaker 0: Uh, the only thing that bothers me is bad grammar.

378
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:27,576
Speaker 0: Yeah Either way, I don't know why this bothers you so much and that was kind of a crazy rant.

379
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:28,840
Speaker 1: It's bothering me.

380
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:31,325
Speaker 0: Okay I pretty much disagree with me.

381
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:32,568
Speaker 1: what movie?

382
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:38,946
Speaker 1: tell me only if something is real and when it's coming out and how much it'll cost And what it's got.

383
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:54,000
Speaker 0: I'll even say that I'm excited about the fact that I learned a while ago that That series of novels the Temeraire books about the Napoleonic Wars with dragons that I found so wonderful and delicious and great Peter Jackson likes him and he's option the rights to make the movies and I'm already excited about that.

384
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,893
Speaker 0: I'm kind of following it to see what he's gonna actually make.

385
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,560
Speaker 1: the movie doesn't mean shit?

386
00:23:58,941 --> 00:23:59,463
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

387
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:03,699
Speaker 0: but I know that he says that if things go the way he'd like him to he'd like to.

388
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,482
Speaker 1: so Why do you?

389
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:06,128
Speaker 1: even so you're getting excited.

390
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:08,317
Speaker 1: you could be getting your hopes up for nothing.

391
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:08,979
Speaker 0: You know what?

392
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,147
Speaker 0: Nothing is certain in this world.

393
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:16,180
Speaker 0: So just about anything I could get my hopes up for there's a chance It might not come through but you know what I get excited.

394
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:25,107
Speaker 0: Anyway, this whole idea of keep expectations low and never hope or never dream for anything is really just kind of Banal and silly.

395
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:33,300
Speaker 1: Well, you know while I don't actually Like consciously say you shouldn't have hopes or expectations for anything Well, that's pretty much what you explicitly are saying.

396
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:41,078
Speaker 0: But I think what it is is that from being on the internet so much and from oh So you're the lord of the internet you get to say what goes on the internet?

397
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:48,566
Speaker 1: No From Swimming in this information for so long.

398
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,870
Speaker 1: I just don't.

399
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,835
Speaker 1: I don't expect anything.

400
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:52,717
Speaker 1: I don't care.

401
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:53,840
Speaker 1: I don't hope for anything.

402
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:04,411
Speaker 1: I only care about what is now and all these, you know There's just so much rumors and bullshit on the net that anything that isn't Substantiated right now fact.

403
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:05,880
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit like these Apple people.

404
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,093
Speaker 1: They're like an iPhones coming until they until the iPhone was in the store.

405
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:12,140
Speaker 1: I just completely ignored every iPhone story.

406
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,479
Speaker 1: I didn't give a shit until you know, they were like who knew IMAX and new IMAX are coming.

407
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:16,820
Speaker 1: They're coming.

408
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,068
Speaker 1: They're coming until they said here's the picture of it.

409
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:23,904
Speaker 1: I didn't click on a single goddamn link, you know, and it's just I guess from experience.

410
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:29,630
Speaker 1: I sort of been trained to be that way and The stuff that goes against my training I filter it out.

411
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:36,036
Speaker 1: and because I filter it out it sort of has, you know It's like associated negatively in my mind as negative.

412
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:36,839
Speaker 1: get that out of here.

413
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:48,553
Speaker 0: Okay, all I really have to say and this is definitely a somewhat inside joke, but like I reviewed on our last geek bite I really like these prints of nothing books and a few people compared me to Kellis.

414
00:25:48,673 --> 00:26:00,987
Speaker 0: in the books a character and Scott is reminding me more and more of K Nair or however you pronounce that guy's name And I think this argument just kind of illustrated that in a funny way to me But that's not gonna mean anything to the rest of you.

415
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:04,558
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think our friend Alex is probably laughing right now, but that's about it.

416
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:07,220
Speaker 1: Yes Anyway, are you guys?

417
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,875
Speaker 1: Don't give a shit if someone has been cast in a movie.

418
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:18,747
Speaker 1: That's not important Especially if you don't a hundred percent sure they've been cast in the movie or if you're not even a hundred percent sure the movie Is gonna even be in the theater.

419
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:19,592
Speaker 0: Okay, Scott.

420
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,020
Speaker 1: Tell me when there's a camera rolling.

421
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,043
Speaker 0: Well, if you're swimming in the pool then the pool of the Internet and what you perceive as the turd floats by just get out Of the pool.

422
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,432
Speaker 0: don't complain about the pool.

423
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:29,700
Speaker 0: You're like the people who get on dig.

424
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:35,220
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's cuz I'm swimming in the pool and I'm having a good time And I got all these people shitting in the pool and I got to kick their asses out.

425
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,560
Speaker 0: But you don't own dig and the masses own dig and whatever they want goes up.

426
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,736
Speaker 0: So if you don't like what's on dig don't go there and I just filter it out.

427
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:45,647
Speaker 1: I'm alright, but the point Oh you filter it out.

428
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,090
Speaker 0: You're right.

429
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,211
Speaker 0: Then.

430
00:26:46,252 --> 00:26:46,978
Speaker 0: Why does it bother you?

431
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:53,849
Speaker 1: Still it gets, you know, not all the turds can you know, you got a no So you're not filtering it fully you don't have.

432
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:56,137
Speaker 1: you can't filter proper can't make a perfect filter.

433
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:59,932
Speaker 0: Just doesn't happen Alright, well Scott's crazy ranting aside.

434
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,020
Speaker 0: I couldn't find any anime news.

435
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,340
Speaker 0: I cared about it all and I'm just gonna talk about this briefly, but there's a story here.

436
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:07,699
Speaker 0: It looks like it happened in New Zealand.

437
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,266
Speaker 0: There was a funeral procession.

438
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:15,920
Speaker 0: now the laws about funeral processions differ all around the world and even in different states in the US.

439
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:28,710
Speaker 0: But there are places in the United States where if someone dies They will put the body in a casket and put it in a hearse and then that hearse will drive from the church where the Ceremony or whatever happened or the funeral home or whatever.

440
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,400
Speaker 0: Yeah to the cemetery where they're gonna bury the person.

441
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:36,760
Speaker 1: Yep, because I mean old churches and stuff They have cemeteries right next to the church like on the church land.

442
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:40,020
Speaker 1: So then they just carry the casket out of the church and put it in the ground.

443
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:41,000
Speaker 0: But that's not the point.

444
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,862
Speaker 0: The point is that there will often be a funeral procession which dates back to a lot of old and I think Stupid customs, but

445
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:51,034
Speaker 1: except for the New Orleans ones watch James Bond movie

446
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:58,165
Speaker 0: only if there are international sexy Super-spies fighting it out secretly within the parade Otherwise not cool.

447
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:02,498
Speaker 1: now the per as long as it's a parade down the street with awesome jazz music.

448
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:03,160
Speaker 1: Well, it's cool.

449
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:15,700
Speaker 0: I have a somewhat controversial opinion that in general I mean I know that respect for the dead was one of the early signs among a lot of people who study civilization of The dawning of civilization and culture and that sort of thing.

450
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:21,380
Speaker 0: I'm of the mind that society and culture should move beyond respect for the dead and I don't think that it serves any more purpose.

451
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:23,589
Speaker 0: But that is neither here nor there.

452
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:31,313
Speaker 1: I think you should respect the dead, but I don't associate that with respect the dead body because a body is just a lump of flesh.

453
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:35,127
Speaker 1: but the person and who they were and the Memory of who they were should be respect.

454
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,493
Speaker 0: That's respect for the former living.

455
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:37,900
Speaker 0: That's different from respect for the day.

456
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,568
Speaker 1: I see you're saying dead as in corpse.

457
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:44,800
Speaker 0: Well, and it's very complicated I don't want to get into it suffice to say specifically the corpses.

458
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,230
Speaker 0: I think cemeteries are perhaps the stupidest idea ever.

459
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,520
Speaker 1: I think cemeteries are pretty impractical.

460
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:50,885
Speaker 1: What they'll do.

461
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:51,507
Speaker 1: Well, I agree.

462
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:52,310
Speaker 1: They are impractical.

463
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,614
Speaker 1: I kind of want a mausoleum.

464
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:55,160
Speaker 1: Well, you're like mausoleums.

465
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:55,882
Speaker 1: What

466
00:28:56,384 --> 00:29:15,778
Speaker 0: they'll often do is the first will go and then all the relatives and people who are going to the stupid funeral Will put little flags on their car and follow the thing and depending on the laws They now have full perfect right-of-way over stop signs traffic lights anything and they go straight to the funeral and cause all sorts of shit terrible traffic everywhere they go.

467
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:18,600
Speaker 0: and I hate funeral processions.

468
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:26,800
Speaker 0: I ran into them a lot as a kid driving around where I grew up and They just suddenly one would come around and it was illegal to get in their way or to cut him off.

469
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:33,520
Speaker 0: And even if you had a green light and they had a red light you had to let him go and they block traffic forever And you weren't allowed to pass him or cut through him or anything.

470
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:38,758
Speaker 0: And I just think the whole idea of it is stupid and I think that these customs should be utterly annihilated.

471
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:46,888
Speaker 1: I agree I mean if you have people who want to drive from place A to place B, even if there are a lot of them Why can't everyone just drive from place A to place B?

472
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:50,720
Speaker 1: Why do you have to go in sort of this line of unbreakableness?

473
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,280
Speaker 0: Well, apparently everyone go apparently a funeral procession here and I read more that this happens a lot.

474
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,860
Speaker 0: They were going and the guy at the front driving the hearse was speeding.

475
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:03,750
Speaker 0: So a cop pulled the funeral procession over.

476
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:13,360
Speaker 0: good during the course of being pulled over which was done in a very early manner There were a whole bunch of accidents because everyone in this procession was a moron who doesn't know how to hit up to hit the brakes.

477
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:16,740
Speaker 1: They got what they deserved and they're mad.

478
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:21,299
Speaker 0: there's their bloody furious quote with the police and they thought it was absolutely disgusting.

479
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,911
Speaker 0: and All I have to say is while I disagree with speeding you were speeding.

480
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:31,620
Speaker 0: cop pulled you over apparently to the funeral director Has been caught before doing this sort of thing.

481
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:37,140
Speaker 1: I guess he thinks because he's in the funeral procession thing he can speed and he probably likes speeding in his hearse.

482
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:42,980
Speaker 0: However, I'm on the mind that everyone who was involved in an accident in the funeral procession deserved exactly what they got.

483
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:48,459
Speaker 0: I hope they all get tickets for following too closely or something and I generally don't like funeral processions.

484
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:53,159
Speaker 0: I'm sorry, that wasn't anime related, but there's just nothing to talk about.

485
00:30:53,601 --> 00:31:00,365
Speaker 1: I mean basically the problem is is that all the news that would be anime manga or comics with stuff that came out of the San Diego comic-con.

486
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:06,435
Speaker 1: but all of that news is along the lines of OMG, here's a pilot for a new TV show.

487
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:07,119
Speaker 1: We don't watch TV.

488
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:11,315
Speaker 1: OMG, these two people are gonna be writing and drawing this comic book.

489
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,620
Speaker 1: We don't read those comic books.

490
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,344
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't help.

491
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:15,054
Speaker 0: that the few news is I cared about.

492
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:15,918
Speaker 0: I already talked about.

493
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:20,775
Speaker 1: yes And none of the news is that we're there are anything big or earth-shattering.

494
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:25,248
Speaker 1: They're all the sort of Superficial who gives a shit stuff that I was just complaining about.

495
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:27,554
Speaker 1: So there's nothing to say about them.

496
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:33,770
Speaker 1: It's just flat information and There's no comment to make unless you're really into that thing.

497
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,563
Speaker 1: in which case the only comment you can make is I approve or I Disapprove.

498
00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:42,927
Speaker 1: and here's why and since we're so indifferent on any of that stuff It's not it's not.

499
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,940
Speaker 0: it's not that I'm indifferent so much as I don't have anything interesting to say about these.

500
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:55,660
Speaker 1: Well, you know you have anything interesting to say about say the fact that I don't know So and so and so and so have been moved from one superhero comic to a different superhero comic.

501
00:31:55,961 --> 00:32:01,080
Speaker 0: I could talk about how the fact that they shuffle artists around is probably one of the problems with superhero comics.

502
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,047
Speaker 0: I could go on this whole sort of tangent about that.

503
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:06,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not you know, that's not related to the specific news.

504
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,380
Speaker 1: That's just in you know, and in general kind of thing about superhero.

505
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:11,508
Speaker 0: Yeah and the news is just a catalyst like now.

506
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:16,191
Speaker 0: my news was just a catalyst to get a tiny and Somewhat less insane than your rant.

507
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:17,900
Speaker 0: rant about funeral procession.

508
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,638
Speaker 0: I think the only difference between the sanity of our rants was that we agree on yours and you see well, I think the other difference is I You were spreading the obscenity around a little bit and I didn't so much.

509
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's wrong with the obscenity?

510
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:41,020
Speaker 0: cuz while I just like funeral processions, I don't care I'm kind of indifferent if I see what I don't suddenly go into a blind fury I don't go into a blind for either but I do go grumble-grumble anyway.

511
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:55,230
Speaker 1: It's time for things of the day, you know, I'm thinking that you know, I mean yesterday We had that whole crazy argument that got cut out of the show, right?

512
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,422
Speaker 1: Yeah, and today we sort of just kind of went a little bit crazy there.

513
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:02,110
Speaker 1: you think maybe the weather is affecting the show.

514
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:12,497
Speaker 0: I don't think so at all because uh use well you started the first argument pretty much straight up and The second one that we had just now It was for at least 50/50.

515
00:33:12,497 --> 00:33:18,444
Speaker 0: I think your crazy rant was crazy and I said so we didn't really argue so much Yeah, but I do feel like I don't know.

516
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:19,550
Speaker 0: I don't think it's the weather.

517
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:26,550
Speaker 0: I think it's just that there hasn't been a lot of interesting news to talk about and When I filled out the schedule for like the next two months of geek nights.

518
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:30,749
Speaker 0: I guess I'm more excited about some of the shows in the future than I am about the ones coming up right now.

519
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, well, we'll try to.

520
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:34,387
Speaker 1: next week.

521
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:49,157
Speaker 1: maybe We're giving you guys what you want because we get more requests for arguments than we do for I think we get those mostly from longtime listeners and our friends and I'm not so I'm not convinced that a lot of the The the more.

522
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:53,399
Speaker 1: I don't know the field, you know how they say in golf It's like Tiger Woods or the field.

523
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,510
Speaker 1: I think the field of listeners.

524
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,441
Speaker 0: I think it's just what's ever happening recently.

525
00:33:57,481 --> 00:34:02,797
Speaker 0: because whenever we argue a lot We get a lot of people saying wow You guys need to lay off and not argue.

526
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:06,714
Speaker 0: and whenever we don't argue we get a bunch of people saying man Bring back the arguments.

527
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,422
Speaker 1: Oh, well, whatever.

528
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:13,409
Speaker 0: It's kind of like whenever we change anything It's like half the people say they want it the old way and after people want it the new way.

529
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:14,938
Speaker 1: What's your thing of the day?

530
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,779
Speaker 0: All right, I'll be real quick about this In Russia in Siberia, I don't know.

531
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,245
Speaker 0: I don't think this was found recently.

532
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:22,610
Speaker 0: I think it's just there's pictures of it down.

533
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:29,449
Speaker 0: There's this old old they call it ancient fortress that's built in the middle of an island deep inside Siberia.

534
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,315
Speaker 0: Okay, and it's really cool.

535
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:36,290
Speaker 1: However, I saw that link, but I think the the picture was dead so I didn't get to see it.

536
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:36,591
Speaker 1: Show me.

537
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,734
Speaker 0: No, the pictures are really better.

538
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:39,359
Speaker 0: the way then I can't talk.

539
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,690
Speaker 1: I'm not I want to see the Fiberian fortress.

540
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:46,989
Speaker 0: But the thing I found really interesting about this is that you know, it's ancient ancient ancient.

541
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:47,873
Speaker 1: How ancient is it?

542
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:51,609
Speaker 0: and then they give the date which is dated more than?

543
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:52,614
Speaker 0: 1,500 years ago.

544
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:57,885
Speaker 0: now 1,500 years ago Rome was in.

545
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,190
Speaker 0: it was Rome had already fallen.

546
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,457
Speaker 1: It's not too old then.

547
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:04,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, oh, it's ancient.

548
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,210
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just because I'm really really studying Roman history now like more so than I have been ever before.

549
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:13,645
Speaker 0: I'm even kind of done with the Byzantine history because I've learned a lot of it.

550
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:14,630
Speaker 0: I'm moving further back.

551
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:19,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if it's not pre Rome, I can't really consider it to be ancient.

552
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:23,850
Speaker 0: Well, it seems like the more you study something like Roman It's set in a hyperbolic fashion the less ancient.

553
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:31,144
Speaker 0: It seems like the Middle Ages and like the Renaissance seems like it happened yesterday and the Middle Ages are like the day before yesterday And then there was Rome.

554
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:39,850
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so it's weird how this doesn't feel old to me But before I was really into Roman and Byzantine history this probably would have seemed really old and really cool.

555
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,842
Speaker 1: this reminds me of something I learned when I was a kid.

556
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:46,759
Speaker 1: something I didn't learn in school is You know, I like castles.

557
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,350
Speaker 1: I like I like castles, you know buildings made of rock.

558
00:35:52,536 --> 00:35:56,363
Speaker 0: So this These pictures are on this like English Russia blog.

559
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:57,930
Speaker 0: It's like a blog about Russia in English.

560
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:06,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I just scrolled down randomly while Scott was talking and you can comment on the site, but there's an anti-spam capture And it's in Cyrillic.

561
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:10,590
Speaker 0: no the picture is the word Soviet in red.

562
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:16,773
Speaker 1: All right, so anyway, so I like castles and you know I never got.

563
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:28,590
Speaker 1: I didn't get to see too many castles when I was a kid, you know I think we went to this one castle Called like Gillette castle in Connecticut and I have actually a snow globe from there Which is supposed supposedly really rare because they stopped making them.

564
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,989
Speaker 1: Well, there's Bannerman castle, which is our house is Bannerman castle and they're those cloisters in the city, right?

565
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:41,269
Speaker 1: And you know when I was a kid, you know I didn't I wasn't so much thinking and you know how mean that the history in the years, right?

566
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,370
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, what was the that are that argument?

567
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,730
Speaker 0: We had way back in the day that the Romans learned about armor and swords from the Knights of the Middle Ages.

568
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, so whatever.

569
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,638
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna bring that up for the rest of your life.

570
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:52,281
Speaker 0: Probably.

571
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:59,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so when I was a kid I would like drive by and you know, I saw like, you know The cloisters and I was like, ooh castles were there.

572
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:01,350
Speaker 1: can it gets in those castles, you know?

573
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,980
Speaker 1: Because I think castles can it gets right.

574
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:08,622
Speaker 1: and my parents were like You know, this castle is on this side is in the Western Hemisphere.

575
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:21,894
Speaker 1: This castle can't possibly be older than like 1600 something and I was like Oh snaps and it totally realized that every castle in the Western Hemisphere sucks unless it's like an Aztec pyramid Which isn't really a castle.

576
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:41,921
Speaker 0: it is pretty interesting when you think about the state of the natives of North America When the West eventually discovered them and started, you know, the raping pillage exploitation Colonization whatever and compare that to the civilizations that existed in Europe or in China, you know Thousand years before two thousand years before.

577
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:43,607
Speaker 0: I find that fascinating.

578
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:44,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is pretty fast.

579
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:59,077
Speaker 0: It's kind of like in Civ - when you're playing the game and you get your infantry and you get your gunpowder And I got my boats and I'm going around and I got iron and then I stumble upon some guy with some cataphracts And he's trying to take over my city.

580
00:37:59,097 --> 00:38:04,672
Speaker 0: Haha, or I find like this gigantic civilization that never found the wheel All right.

581
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:10,730
Speaker 0: The thing is I've never in the course of playing Civ - not immediately conquered those people without regret.

582
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:15,560
Speaker 1: Okay, are you ready?

583
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:16,262
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

584
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,470
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give you the reveal of why I had the crazy red.

585
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,638
Speaker 1: Okay, you ready for this thing of the day?

586
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:21,241
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

587
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:28,742
Speaker 1: There's a rumor going around that There's gonna be a new Toyota AE 86 and there's a picture of it.

588
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:32,069
Speaker 1: That's kind of old news I know but what else did I have?

589
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,996
Speaker 1: And also the point.

590
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:37,410
Speaker 1: the reason I chose this is I put it with the pre crazy, right?

591
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,375
Speaker 1: You see what I just did.

592
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:39,059
Speaker 0: they see what you did.

593
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,804
Speaker 0: I see what you did.

594
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:40,750
Speaker 1: They see what I did there.

595
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,076
Speaker 1: Check this shit out.

596
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:43,926
Speaker 1: It's basically it's not.

597
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:44,790
Speaker 1: it doesn't look anything.

598
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,662
Speaker 1: Well, I won't say it doesn't look anything like the original 86.

599
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:53,909
Speaker 0: the only thing that was special I mean the AE 86 was just a chassis pretty much but the only it.

600
00:38:54,915 --> 00:39:03,007
Speaker 1: Basically, it's the same car in spirit But it's a new car and it's gonna be really light really small really low to the ground and it's gonna have like 120 horsepower.

601
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:07,816
Speaker 1: That's not so bad According to this here man.

602
00:39:07,936 --> 00:39:09,080
Speaker 0: That's the same horsepower.

603
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,023
Speaker 0: My current car has.

604
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:14,310
Speaker 1: yeah, if I was buying cars now I'd actually consider this car greatly.

605
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,616
Speaker 0: Now the thing is I existed.

606
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:22,130
Speaker 0: I think that this is brilliant because The rice out culture is actually really kind of popular in the US.

607
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:34,170
Speaker 0: Yeah and a lot of those people even though they're not really anime fans at all a lot of them know about initial D a Lot of them not only that but in Japan, I mean this picture here is from Japan with Japanese riding on it.

608
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,554
Speaker 1: They're all into the initial D.

609
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,477
Speaker 0: still they'll buy it.

610
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:37,039
Speaker 0: Yep.

611
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:54,710
Speaker 0: Kind of I really think that if companies Released cars that were from initial D only Affordable and like if someone remade the celady somehow like made a this is a celady that we've made now Just like the old celady they make a lot of money.

612
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,492
Speaker 0: well I mean

613
00:39:55,652 --> 00:40:15,810
Speaker 1: look at how cars like the Honda Civic just sell insanely because it's so riceable and The other company is like they don't have very many cars that are very riceable At least not as riceable as some of the others, you know Toyota releasing a new 86 would pretty much be making a car that's riceable on purpose to make a lot of money.

614
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:21,779
Speaker 1: I mean way the the Corolla not so riceable, you know I mean any car is riceable to a point.

615
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,462
Speaker 1: but this car will be like the rice Money-making machine if they put it out here and they should right.

616
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,369
Speaker 0: So let's talk about anime at least a little bit.

617
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:31,230
Speaker 0: Luckily, it's gonna be kind of short.

618
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,194
Speaker 0: You see we had a bun.

619
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:41,130
Speaker 0: I had the whole schedule filled out about what we were gonna talk about in the shows and the comics Whatever, but then we watched the first episode of one of the new anime coming out.

620
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:45,448
Speaker 1: Well, actually I knew this anime was coming cuz Emily said something about it.

621
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:55,863
Speaker 1: I mean basically all I heard was there's a show called this and it's a mafia show which Tells Scott good show coming mafia good by default no matter what pretty much.

622
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean we didn't have any expectations about it.

623
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,715
Speaker 0: It was just alright.

624
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,910
Speaker 0: This is a show that has some potential and a lot of shows had potential.

625
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,680
Speaker 0: I mean ergo proxy, I think still has but I haven't watched it all.

626
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:11,490
Speaker 0: No, but when I saw that I was excited and all Bocorano, I'm really excited about still and all that.

627
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:12,968
Speaker 0: But this is just a show like that.

628
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:17,070
Speaker 0: The show looks like it might be better than the majority of the dross that we've been seeing lately.

629
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:29,789
Speaker 1: Yep, so the first episode finally comes out and the show is called baccano b a c c a n o Exclamation point and I think in Italian that means noise or something like that.

630
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:48,057
Speaker 0: And it's a show that is not translated as stupid commotion, uh-huh, and It's a show that is about Mafias, I guess and a whole cast of characters and other things see regardless of what it's about because I actually went into it Not knowing anything at all about.

631
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,080
Speaker 1: all I knew was mafias.

632
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,763
Speaker 1: That was all I knew.

633
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:56,263
Speaker 0: all I knew was the title and From that I think and then Scott Emily like yeah mafia something.

634
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:58,833
Speaker 0: so I think alright show about mafia this is gonna be great.

635
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:06,443
Speaker 0: and Scott accidentally pulled up the like preview trailer instead of the episode and It was all weird and music.

636
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:15,842
Speaker 0: people on a train killing each other like murders on a train in a kid with a weird scar tattoo something on his face and Kind of surreal almost supernatural.

637
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:17,390
Speaker 0: It didn't look anything like what I expected.

638
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,274
Speaker 1: No It looked like.

639
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:24,790
Speaker 1: it looked to me like a dark Sort of weird murder on the Orient Express kind of deal and the in the trailer.

640
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:26,735
Speaker 1: So then we watch the actual show.

641
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,062
Speaker 1: all right the show opens up right.

642
00:42:29,523 --> 00:42:31,730
Speaker 1: first they give you that old sponsor.

643
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,337
Speaker 1: well No first they give you the opener.

644
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:33,578
Speaker 1: right.

645
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:35,145
Speaker 1: the opener has a pretty cool song.

646
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,290
Speaker 1: can we get the opener in the show?

647
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:36,894
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

648
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:37,661
Speaker 0: I don't want to bother.

649
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:43,290
Speaker 1: we could but The opener is a lot like the opener to snatch or one of those movies.

650
00:42:43,531 --> 00:42:44,735
Speaker 0: That's that's the thing.

651
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:49,110
Speaker 0: as soon as we saw the actual opener all I could think was this is snatched the anime.

652
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:52,369
Speaker 1: yeah, they had all these really cool this really cool music.

653
00:42:52,389 --> 00:43:06,721
Speaker 1: and What they would do in the opener is they would show you a character doing something then they would freeze-frame the character Put their name on the screen in English right English letters And then have a cool Transition to do the next character.

654
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:11,960
Speaker 1: and there were a whole lot of characters And they took the entire opener just going through all these characters.

655
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:14,788
Speaker 1: show a character show their name smooth transition.

656
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:16,613
Speaker 1: show a character show A name smooth transition.

657
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:18,600
Speaker 0: now the thing is every single character.

658
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,202
Speaker 0: They showed.

659
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:21,570
Speaker 0: you think wow that's obviously the main character.

660
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:24,883
Speaker 0: Oh wow that's obviously the main character and every one of them.

661
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:33,070
Speaker 0: just from what little you see You probably already like them as a character, and you think wow there could probably be a show just about this one person.

662
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:40,700
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that I didn't really feel that but I did feel that None of the characters really put above or below the others.

663
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,065
Speaker 1: usually you feel like some characters are more important and some are less important And some are main and some are supporting, but it really felt like every character.

664
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:57,444
Speaker 1: They showed was Equal like they are all Equally important and equally in the plot and none of them are minor or more major than others.

665
00:43:57,524 --> 00:44:06,332
Speaker 1: most importantly for these two characters Because they had the most time in the opener and they're the last characters you see and also the first characters you see and the Opener.

666
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:09,010
Speaker 1: so I think they might be slightly more important than the others.

667
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,018
Speaker 0: They all just reeked of main character.

668
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,997
Speaker 0: like if anyone if you saw any one of them and some other anime you think oh They're a main character.

669
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:17,470
Speaker 0: They're some somewhat important to the plot.

670
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,499
Speaker 0: They're not just gonna get killed off randomly or anything.

671
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:20,725
Speaker 0: They'll have a name.

672
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:21,910
Speaker 1: They all have a name.

673
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:33,496
Speaker 1: They should have a name in the opener All right, so after that they give you the sponsor screen right, but the sponsor screen You know like where they usually say you know oh take your day Oh get it she must you know

674
00:44:33,516 --> 00:44:33,556
Speaker 0: by

675
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:38,135
Speaker 1: look go you know it's brought to you by our sponsor Consume right.

676
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,008
Speaker 1: the guy said in English.

677
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:46,695
Speaker 0: now I don't know if they did that in English or if the fansubbers just being funny because that is possible I think they did in English.

678
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:49,005
Speaker 1: I mean the openers the characters names were in English.

679
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

680
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:54,133
Speaker 0: I mean English is still pretty hip yes So I don't know it.

681
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:58,810
Speaker 1: does that mean that this show is meant for us in America more than it's meant for the Japan's?

682
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:01,724
Speaker 0: I don't know, but regardless of all that all right.

683
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,010
Speaker 0: so that opener happens now.

684
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,364
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what this show is about because it still looks like it's about.

685
00:45:06,444 --> 00:45:13,310
Speaker 0: it's about mafia something and Other than the weird trailer we saw a few snippets of I don't see anything weird about it right.

686
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:21,639
Speaker 1: So it opens up with this guy with a monocle and this is girl this little girl But she's not super little or stupid.

687
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:22,503
Speaker 1: She's just I don't know.

688
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:23,226
Speaker 1: is she a teenager.

689
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:23,829
Speaker 1: I can't really tell.

690
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,153
Speaker 0: no She's not a teenager.

691
00:45:25,174 --> 00:45:28,564
Speaker 0: She's a really young little girl, but she she acts smart.

692
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,450
Speaker 1: She just doesn't look very old at all.

693
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,020
Speaker 1: She looks like she's maybe 12 at the most.

694
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,325
Speaker 0: well the thing is but she talks.

695
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:39,723
Speaker 0: the show opens with a conversation between these two characters, and you don't know anything about them at all.

696
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:45,409
Speaker 0: you don't really know anything about what the show's about and Nothing from the opener really told you what to expect.

697
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:47,819
Speaker 1: They just said here are the characters here are their names because

698
00:45:47,859 --> 00:46:04,510
Speaker 0: it was all over the place and these characters Proceed they talk in a really cryptic way for a while But it actually all kind of makes sense and you kind of follow what's going on And it's kind of interesting and then you realize that they start arguing as to who are the main characters of the story?

699
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,148
Speaker 1: Huh gee I don't know.

700
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:16,065
Speaker 1: At the one hand it was really clever and awesome, but on the other hand it was Slightly sort of forced and obvious and not subtle,

701
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:22,663
Speaker 0: but it seats to me It wasn't really that force because then they also start arguing about When the story started and that

702
00:46:22,703 --> 00:46:23,930
Speaker 1: part was actually pretty cool

703
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,129
Speaker 0: Yes, and they basically it keeps cutting back to them.

704
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:34,172
Speaker 0: But between them talking and arguing about when the story started who the main character is who's moving it What's going on?

705
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:45,190
Speaker 0: it cuts to these flashbacks from all throughout time from it seems like almost everything They showed is a scene from the show that we haven't gotten to yet either from the future or the past.

706
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:57,650
Speaker 1: Yep And you learn from the people talking that these two people that the old guy is like the vice Director of a newspaper of some sort and the girl it guesses his assistant I think and I think that's what they say.

707
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:07,490
Speaker 0: I think there's a funny bit where whenever she says something insightful the guy always says like you get 384 points and she's like out of how many and she says it's really funny.

708
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:09,968
Speaker 0: Look, I just keeps talking and he doesn't say anything.

709
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:20,130
Speaker 0: now The point I really want to make is that they they do this interesting thing that in any other anime would have been forced and Stupid, you know a bunch of care to characters arguing about who the main characters of the show are.

710
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:28,126
Speaker 0: it's really kind of meta breaking the fourth wall and all that sort of thing, but The show pulled it off to the point that I feel like it.

711
00:47:28,648 --> 00:47:32,549
Speaker 0: it was done Well that this could be a really good mechanic or device in the show.

712
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:33,256
Speaker 0: It was.

713
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:34,410
Speaker 1: it was done pretty well.

714
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,698
Speaker 1: I mean it didn't you?

715
00:47:35,738 --> 00:47:43,071
Speaker 1: normally if like you had that kind of thing It might be the sort of thing you'd put it like the end of your show and it'd be like an end of Ava kind Of thing.

716
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:43,854
Speaker 1: that would be all we.

717
00:47:43,934 --> 00:47:45,661
Speaker 0: it reminds me a little bit.

718
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,870
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna compare the show to cowboy bebop.

719
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's no way you can know.

720
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:57,222
Speaker 0: but cowboy bebop was a show that basically came out and had the sheer testicular fortitude to Say we are making a new genre.

721
00:47:57,262 --> 00:48:03,250
Speaker 0: We are going into uncharted waters We are doing something amazing and different and then it backed that up a hundred percent.

722
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:14,410
Speaker 0: Yeah this show is treading into those waters a little bit a little bit a little bit in the sense that they're going balls out and Saying we're doing something that if we don't do it right is gonna make our show really stupid in force.

723
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:19,950
Speaker 0: It'll make it so stupid if they don't do it, right and thus far they haven't fallen on their faces yet.

724
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:20,949
Speaker 0: That means a lot to me.

725
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:39,710
Speaker 1: The only negative thing I can say about the show so far is that it's a little bit hard to follow What's going on because of the crazy stuff that they're doing cutting all over the place in Chronology showing all these different characters without formally and introducing them slowly but sort of just throwing them in in your face.

726
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:46,070
Speaker 0: Yes, when we say cutting around it's not like you expect you'll have to watch it to see but literally there's no transition.

727
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:55,165
Speaker 0: It's like guy doing something cut to a different angle of guy doing something cut to what feels like a different angle But it's actually a different scene at a different time with different characters.

728
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:59,341
Speaker 1: Yep, and I gotta say as can be as confusing as it was.

729
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:01,650
Speaker 1: It wasn't stupidly confusing, but it was pretty confusing.

730
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:06,864
Speaker 1: I watched the first episode a second time and now I got a really good handle on.

731
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:08,588
Speaker 0: I gotta say it felt confusing.

732
00:49:08,689 --> 00:49:13,611
Speaker 0: and there's It's a lot of books do this to not a lot but books that I think are good if you do it Right.

733
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:40,630
Speaker 0: It's a really nice thing if you introduce concepts or proper nouns or anything that is Specific to the world of the arts the world of that you're creating in the work and you don't explain it But you use it in the proper context and if you do it in the right way People will start to learn on their own how everything works without Realizing it and they'll learn a lot more about the world without having to have lengthy lengthy stupid boring exposition about the world.

734
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:45,850
Speaker 0: Yep, but the only problem with that if done poorly if you just get proper noun gobbledygook.

735
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:50,830
Speaker 1: Also, if the problem is is that you can't get someone into the world quickly.

736
00:49:51,252 --> 00:50:03,939
Speaker 1: So if you've only got like one issue of a comic book or one episode of an anime It's sort of difficult for people to get all the way there and reach understanding in that You know one unit of the work also some people.

737
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:18,176
Speaker 0: I'll say this if you're one of those people who tries to figure out what's going On like really hard when you're watching a show I think that will hinder your understanding of what happens in the first episode because you'll spend too much time worried about Who's who and the names the side.

738
00:50:18,236 --> 00:50:25,010
Speaker 0: already the scene will change and all this business and honestly if you just roll with it You'll learn you'll figure out a lot more real quick.

739
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,680
Speaker 0: Just don't don't try to remember the names of all the people.

740
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:29,809
Speaker 0: just pay attention to what's going on and just go with it.

741
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:32,510
Speaker 1: if you Really want to understand it just watch it twice.

742
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:36,970
Speaker 1: I watched the first episode two times and the second time I completely understood everything that was going down.

743
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:38,002
Speaker 0: I was like, oh I get it.

744
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:39,754
Speaker 1: Oh duh It's not that complicated now.

745
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:48,850
Speaker 0: the second moment that really stood out is the show went along and it's kind of interesting and you get All these glimpses of the future in the past and you see scenes that I'm sure we're gonna forget about.

746
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,005
Speaker 0: And then we'll get to like episode 12, I love that shit.

747
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:52,930
Speaker 1: Utena did that shit.

748
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:58,107
Speaker 0: Oh god Utena was like the king queen and they show you a really short like clip like.

749
00:50:58,147 --> 00:51:03,545
Speaker 1: they'll show you like I don't know a rock flying across the sky or they'll show you like a bird standing.

750
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:05,070
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll give you a specific scene.

751
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:22,062
Speaker 0: There's a scene in Utena kind of early on when Auntie He met me other, you know The Rose bride girl the weird girl the Indian girl and she's just sitting in a classroom Doing something weird and it lingers on this scene for all and you think all right That scene just showed me that Auntie's a little weird something I knew.

752
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,570
Speaker 0: I'll bet they just needed to fill out this episode.

753
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,916
Speaker 0: That was kind of bland and short.

754
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,555
Speaker 0: and then you see the whole show and you go back and watch that again And it's like whoa.

755
00:51:31,056 --> 00:51:32,480
Speaker 1: I know what she's doing now.

756
00:51:32,581 --> 00:51:33,965
Speaker 1: Damn dams.

757
00:51:34,286 --> 00:51:35,670
Speaker 0: This show can definitely pull that off.

758
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:44,473
Speaker 0: I love that when a movie shows you something and it's all right there You're just too stupid and uninformed to figure it out yet, but theoretically you could have within the first episode They do that.

759
00:51:44,493 --> 00:51:47,330
Speaker 1: I'll actually give you a specific example from the first episode of Baccano.

760
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:48,850
Speaker 0: I think I know which one you're gonna get.

761
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,614
Speaker 1: Well, no They show you really quickly.

762
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:51,376
Speaker 1: at some point.

763
00:51:51,738 --> 00:52:04,323
Speaker 1: one of the characters that you probably only remember from the opener getting like There's like some girl with like a spear that has like a cross of blades at the end of it Like she cuts his ear and then it's like a two-second clip.

764
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:06,030
Speaker 1: like cuts his ear and you're just like, huh?

765
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,459
Speaker 1: And then it goes away and deals with something else instead.

766
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:12,795
Speaker 1: and then like really close to the end of the episode You see the guy like.

767
00:52:12,815 --> 00:52:17,412
Speaker 1: they go back to the guy suddenly like just cut to him and he's like, oh my ear something's.

768
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:22,326
Speaker 1: and then he says something else after that and I didn't notice that those two like.

769
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:29,309
Speaker 1: it's like they took a scene and they Just caught like the first five seconds of it and put it way early in the episode instead of putting them together.

770
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:33,149
Speaker 0: now I really don't want to ruin more about what's going on because I don't want to poison the.

771
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:38,530
Speaker 0: well I really want all of you to watch the show and figure out and just experience the revelations as you will.

772
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:39,460
Speaker 1: I also don't.

773
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:40,270
Speaker 0: but there's a moment.

774
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:44,690
Speaker 0: They were the moment other than when they start arguing about who the main characters are.

775
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:48,546
Speaker 0: There's a point at which a hobo tries to stab some dude

776
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:49,771
Speaker 1: and a good moment the

777
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:58,178
Speaker 0: scene does not play out the way you think it's going to play out and then when you think you know what's going on like You think oh, so it's going in that direction.

778
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,370
Speaker 0: No, it's not and it's great.

779
00:53:01,952 --> 00:53:02,995
Speaker 1: It is pretty damn awesome.

780
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:04,159
Speaker 0: Of course related to that.

781
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,730
Speaker 0: This is one of those shows where there isn't a lot of violence.

782
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:12,710
Speaker 0: It's not like there's uncharacteristic or just violence without purpose or people getting blown up.

783
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,926
Speaker 0: It's none of those each of the killer things.

784
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:21,950
Speaker 0: but When there is violence, they do not dick around and it is brutal and it's not really graphic.

785
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:26,005
Speaker 1: It's like God except for that one since it's a lot like the violence and the Godfather.

786
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:30,326
Speaker 1: when this violence OMG It's it's sort of real they go out of their way to make obvious.

787
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:31,029
Speaker 1: That's what there is.

788
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:37,107
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not super bloody and gory But it has that hint of realism to the point that you wince a little bit.

789
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:40,689
Speaker 0: and even me I mean I watch he the killer and laughed all the way through it.

790
00:53:41,111 --> 00:53:56,182
Speaker 1: But I look at each of the killer is a lot of that sort of zipper on the back of the monster costume true Roast violence and not the sort of it's like you can have a lot less quantity of blood a lot less You know quantity of bullets and guts all over.

791
00:53:56,222 --> 00:53:57,085
Speaker 0: this is the violence.

792
00:53:57,106 --> 00:54:07,060
Speaker 1: but be more effective in making people wince or feel uncomfortable because your violence is more realistic and less sort of you know, Fake zipper on the back of the monster.

793
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,350
Speaker 0: I think the reason is this is the violence of permanence.

794
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:17,290
Speaker 0: I mean take a scene where a guy in an anime Punches another guy straight up in the face and then a scene change covers all the damage.

795
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,667
Speaker 0: Maybe he has a bandage on or a little scratch or something, but the character is otherwise fine.

796
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:27,890
Speaker 0: now Imagine the same scene only he punches the guy and you see very clearly blood and a tooth fly out of his mouth.

797
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:30,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then in the next scene his jaw is swollen.

798
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:32,524
Speaker 1: That's why slow-mo boxing.

799
00:54:32,665 --> 00:54:34,109
Speaker 1: it is really painful to watch.

800
00:54:35,914 --> 00:54:44,998
Speaker 0: All right, and I gotta say there is one kind of gross scene near the end where the guy is talking to the police Yeah, where that was pretty gross.

801
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:49,037
Speaker 0: It's a scene where I'm looking at it and Emily's looking at it and Scott Look, it's so quick.

802
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,749
Speaker 1: You might not even catch the grossness.

803
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,179
Speaker 0: So we're all thinking is that what I think it is?

804
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:54,022
Speaker 0: and it was.

805
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:57,299
Speaker 1: I watched it a second time on the train today And it was totally what you think it.

806
00:54:57,319 --> 00:55:03,330
Speaker 0: by the time you realize what it is You've already missed the next scene because you forgot about the fact that the show is gonna cut away.

807
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:08,790
Speaker 1: Yep, and while it's grow basically shows you something really gross for like a half a second and then cuts away.

808
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:13,770
Speaker 0: I got to admit I found that scene hilarious just because of the delayed reaction of the police officers.

809
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:13,930
Speaker 0: I

810
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:23,501
Speaker 1: think it was sort of like this weird scene because the top half of the frame was funny where all the police were but the Bottom half where the gross part was was gross and also the fact

811
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:23,661
Speaker 0: that

812
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,190
Speaker 1: the top was good and the bottom was not so good.

813
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:34,250
Speaker 0: Right before that happens There is a little bit of dialogue between him and another character on the screen and you suddenly Really hate him as a character.

814
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:40,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz he says some pretty crazy and bad stuff and then it's gross and then now Lisa funny.

815
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:42,150
Speaker 0: I think the reason I'm excited.

816
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,690
Speaker 0: I'm more excited about this show than I've been about any anime in a long time.

817
00:55:46,293 --> 00:55:49,030
Speaker 0: And even though the show might not I mean I was the same way about noir.

818
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:53,064
Speaker 0: The first episode of noir had all this potential and I thought it was gonna be great.

819
00:55:53,145 --> 00:56:00,710
Speaker 0: and it's a noir Ended up being if you compare how much how good the first episode was to how stupid the last.

820
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:05,650
Speaker 1: I think the problem with noir is that they used awesome music to make their show seem better than it was.

821
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,155
Speaker 0: Yes, kind of like a die heck.

822
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,403
Speaker 1: Yes, same same compose same composer.

823
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:11,170
Speaker 0: Yes, or what was that other one?

824
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,917
Speaker 0: The one we reviewed the stupid one.

825
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:22,314
Speaker 0: I don't remember that was the same as noir or But this show is Whether or not it's good.

826
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:24,422
Speaker 0: They've decided to do something different.

827
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:26,690
Speaker 0: It's not like any anime I've seen in a long time.

828
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:33,426
Speaker 0: It's a breath of fresh air and if they pull it off It's gonna be one of those shows that stands out as you know, what all the anime right now is?

829
00:56:33,446 --> 00:56:34,410
Speaker 0: the same moe crap.

830
00:56:34,752 --> 00:56:35,497
Speaker 0: We're gonna fix that.

831
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:39,950
Speaker 1: All right, there's only two other things I got to say about the show before we end this business.

832
00:56:40,652 --> 00:56:45,770
Speaker 1: The guy the guy who's the director of the newspaper something the assistant newspaper director, whatever.

833
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:47,479
Speaker 0: Oh, I totally forgot about that.

834
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:49,610
Speaker 1: the guy that guy he has the monocle.

835
00:56:49,671 --> 00:56:55,001
Speaker 1: He's talking to the young girl for like, you know There's sort of the central characters at least of this episode.

836
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:58,614
Speaker 1: now think about once you talk about the main character I think you might know him.

837
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:09,036
Speaker 1: He the voice actor in Japanese for that guy is the same voice actor for Chiyo's dad and as a manga dial and also Mikazawa.

838
00:57:09,056 --> 00:57:13,826
Speaker 1: and I gotta say I really like the way that guy says Dorshte.

839
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,885
Speaker 1: It just says it like so slow.

840
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:17,689
Speaker 0: I can't do it.

841
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:24,389
Speaker 1: I can't do it But the guy says Dorshte in a really awesome way and that's how I knew it was him as soon as he said that.

842
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:28,715
Speaker 0: now It was funny because I was thinking that voice sounds familiar But I couldn't quite pay.

843
00:57:28,755 --> 00:57:30,324
Speaker 1: I said that's I think it's Chiyo's dad.

844
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:32,294
Speaker 1: and then when he said Dorshte I'm like it's Chiyo's dad.

845
00:57:32,394 --> 00:57:35,247
Speaker 0: I was 50/50 but Scott was like, I'm sure I'm sure sure enough.

846
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:35,810
Speaker 0: Scott was right.

847
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,514
Speaker 1: I was right now.

848
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:37,882
Speaker 1: There's another character.

849
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:39,833
Speaker 0: Now my name is mr Luck is.

850
00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:47,150
Speaker 1: his name is like luck and he's part of one of the mafia families I think the one that begins with a G. I'm not sure but his first name is luck.

851
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:48,098
Speaker 1: So he's like luck.

852
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:52,382
Speaker 1: and then his last name is Mafia family name that begins with G and I think he's like.

853
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:56,590
Speaker 1: I don't think he's the head of that mafia family But he's like maybe like one of the upper guys.

854
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,333
Speaker 1: He's pretty important.

855
00:57:57,634 --> 00:58:02,651
Speaker 0: now both of us the guy said pretty much two words and Scott and I were like, it's him It's him.

856
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:13,817
Speaker 1: the guy the voice actor they got for this character who I think is pretty awesome is our man the Takehito Koyasu, I gotta say that guy still This is a lot.

857
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:15,770
Speaker 0: character is the same as every other character.

858
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:24,988
Speaker 0: He voice acts as he always plays the same character the cool suave guy They really like who's just too cool for school and really smooth and a badass.

859
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:25,490
Speaker 1: and he's gonna.

860
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,417
Speaker 1: He can't be touched cuz he's so awesome.

861
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,130
Speaker 0: The guy who's always underestimated by his opponents yet always wins in the end.

862
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, except against.

863
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:33,357
Speaker 0: well, I can't spoil.

864
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:39,657
Speaker 1: Yes, but yeah, the same voice actor is Toga and utenna and Takahashi ryoseki and initial D.

865
00:58:39,797 --> 00:58:41,363
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a hori and fushigi Yugi.

866
00:58:41,423 --> 00:58:45,357
Speaker 0: Yes, bud mint and KO century beast He's my favorite voice actor ever probably.

867
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:51,830
Speaker 1: and so you got these two amazing voice actors in the show not to mention I think I recognize some other voice actors in there.

868
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:52,412
Speaker 1: I just wasn't.

869
00:58:52,753 --> 00:58:57,710
Speaker 1: I'm not super fans of them nor did I a hundred percent recognize them because I don't know that much about voice.

870
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:01,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't look through super much, but I feel like this show might have an all-star cast.

871
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:17,914
Speaker 1: I think it does have Basically an all-star cast of anime voice actors and it's not an all-star cast of like, you know Japanese movie stars or anything, but you know, it's not like I do with the Mononoke game The Ghibli movies.

872
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:21,609
Speaker 1: when Disney does it they get like Hollywood real actors always like Billy Crystal.

873
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:27,619
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, Billy Crystal was a really good job as the Billy Crystal is a fantastic voice actor And I like him as a person quite a bit.

874
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,464
Speaker 0: I find him hilarious.

875
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:40,338
Speaker 1: He's pretty funny guy especially in Princess Bride, but yeah, so This is a show that if you like anime and you watch the fan subs Probably a good idea to watch this show.

876
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:44,270
Speaker 1: if you don't I recommend you watch this first episode two times.

877
00:59:44,531 --> 00:59:49,876
Speaker 0: I'll say this the less you like the average anime that's come out recently I think the more you're gonna like this show.

878
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:54,010
Speaker 1: and if you don't like weird stuff is the probably just weird you out.

879
00:59:54,573 --> 01:00:03,947
Speaker 0: I do want to say give it a chance because there's something very Very important that we did not spoil and at least learn that before you decide.

880
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:10,870
Speaker 0: if you think you'll like this show Because it's kind of you won't guess what it is, but you should be able to figure it out during the course of the episode.

881
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:22,890
Speaker 0: There's there's another element to this show that is not expected in a mafia show And that'll that aspect I think is going to make a lot of people who would otherwise brush this show off.

882
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:26,748
Speaker 1: I think that I think how that aspect is handled is going to make or break the show.

883
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:35,952
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
