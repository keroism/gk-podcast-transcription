1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,061
Speaker 0: It's Monday, January 10th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:11,322
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:14,070
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,752
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,454
Speaker 0: Tonight, the death of the PC.

6
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:18,875
Speaker 0: Again, let's do this.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,230
Speaker 0: I'm sorry that your listeners missed the last five minutes of our conversation before we started this shindig.

8
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:32,549
Speaker 1: Why would they want to hear that?

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,729
Speaker 0: Because it was pretty awesome.

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,973
Speaker 0: But, uh, sound day.

11
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:37,638
Speaker 0: Yesterday was a very important day.

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,150
Speaker 0: The annual, the tenth annual No Pants Day in New York City.

13
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:43,499
Speaker 1: Oh, we've only gone to two, though.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,285
Speaker 1: So it's, for us, it's number two.

15
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:46,550
Speaker 1: Even though there was ten.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,710
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, we didn't live here, so what can you expect?

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,830
Speaker 1: We could have gone on any other subway.

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,097
Speaker 0: It would have been too much of a pain in the ass.

19
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,790
Speaker 0: Plus, I did not know it happened until the year before we did it.

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is one thing I think Improv Everywhere needs to do, is they, it's like, you gotta check their website, or they have RSS.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,982
Speaker 1: But I don't think they have, like, email reminders or anything.

22
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,990
Speaker 1: We need to, I need to figure out that whole thing.

23
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we totally missed the, uh, MP3 experiments.

24
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,530
Speaker 1: That happened, that basically blinked us.

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, we happened to be doing a panel in the Kinokuniya, and then suddenly- Well, there's an episode of that, right?

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the entire crowd stands up and they're like,

27
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:22,660
Speaker 0: "What?".

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,189
Speaker 0: And they're looking behind us, we're like, "God damn it, turn

29
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:25,330
Speaker 0: around.".

30
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:26,710
Speaker 1: We've already, we've already discussed this.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, on a show that Monday listeners probably don't listen to.

32
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:30,573
Speaker 1: Yeah.

33
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:31,036
Speaker 1: I don't know.

34
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,230
Speaker 1: No Pants is pretty much the same as the previous No Pants.

35
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,255
Speaker 1: I was kind of disappointed.

36
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:36,889
Speaker 0: It was, like, the first time it was fun, like, "Oh my God, we're doing

37
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:36,950
Speaker 0: it.".

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,766
Speaker 0: At this time, it was like, "Alright, I did

39
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:38,827
Speaker 0: it.".

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:48,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think part of the problem was that, at least on my particular subway car, there were some people who were just, like, not- There were less people who were following instructions strictly.

41
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, my whole team was just talking about it on the subway platform before we got on the car.

42
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:54,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, and- I'm like, "Dudes, shut up.

43
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,346
Speaker 0: We don't know each

44
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:55,568
Speaker 0: other.".

45
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:03,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then, it's like, you know, not only that, but it's like one person not following instructions basically ruins one whole car, right?

46
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,950
Speaker 1: Even, you know, no matter how many other people do follow the instructions.

47
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,449
Speaker 0: The trouble is, to make it more complex would just introduce more people fucking it up.

48
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can't really, you know, it's the law of nature, right?

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:22,710
Speaker 1: Is that if you want to get a group of people to do something, the bigger the group, the less they can do in unison without extreme practice, right?

50
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,590
Speaker 0: That's why it's the wave and not, I don't know.

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:35,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the only times that they can, you know, you get more complicated things, such as the soccer stadium singing a song, is because they all individually practiced and prepared the song.

52
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,077
Speaker 0: Practice and dedication.

53
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:42,490
Speaker 1: I mean, I practiced- Or when you see like, you know, people doing the card flips that are like animations, you know?

54
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:46,170
Speaker 0: I practiced taking my pants off to make sure I could do it quickly enough.

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,170
Speaker 1: It's because they coordinated and practiced a lot beforehand.

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,630
Speaker 1: So, with the No Pants Day, it's pretty much show up, ten minutes of getting talked at, and then doing it.

57
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,390
Speaker 0: Ah, but I think I identified the real problem.

58
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:02,310
Speaker 0: Last year, they gave much better and more detailed instruction at the individual group level.

59
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:04,570
Speaker 1: Well, at least at our particular group.

60
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,330
Speaker 0: This year, at our station, many of the group leaders did not really tell anyone what to do, and I kind of took over my group.

61
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think one thing is.

62
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:21,870
Speaker 1: the one difference, I think, that made that happen, at least at our station, was that last year, the group leaders were given a piece of paper with instructions.

63
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:24,410
Speaker 1: This year, they were just sort of told instructions.

64
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:28,950
Speaker 0: I feel like next year, I'm gonna participate, but I'm not- Show up early and be the leader.

65
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:31,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I just won't participate with the group.

66
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,749
Speaker 0: We'll make our own group and do something more complex.

67
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,309
Speaker 1: What could you do that's more complex?

68
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,590
Speaker 0: I'll ride the seven fucking train.

69
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,930
Speaker 1: They already do ride the seven train.

70
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:41,609
Speaker 0: Ooh, I didn't say any seven train plan.

71
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:45,190
Speaker 1: If you go and start at the Unisphere, they ride the seven train.

72
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,150
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, Unisphere.

73
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:49,530
Speaker 1: It's like, they already do all the trains.

74
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,620
Speaker 0: You know what they don't do?

75
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,045
Speaker 0: They don't do the G. No one's on the G.

76
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,170
Speaker 1: There's no one on the G.

77
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,608
Speaker 0: With no pants.

78
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,410
Speaker 1: You'll be on the G with no pants alone.

79
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, scare the conductor.

80
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:58,505
Speaker 1: Okay.

81
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:07,670
Speaker 1: You could take the G with no pants to the Brooklyn Williamsburg starting point, and then go with them, the hipsters.

82
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,729
Speaker 1: I think what would be better if I just- The hipsters are probably more eccentric with their no pants.

83
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,099
Speaker 0: If I just, the next time I'm going to Manhattan for something like a Saturday, I just do it on my own.

84
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,470
Speaker 1: I just take my pants off.

85
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,495
Speaker 1: That's all you.

86
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,224
Speaker 1: Someone might come up to you and be like, "Hey, you're

87
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:19,425
Speaker 1: late.".

88
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:28,850
Speaker 0: The other trouble is that too many people, not on my car, but I saw a lot of other cars where the general public knew what was going on right away.

89
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,359
Speaker 0: They're like, "It's that fucking pants thing

90
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:30,560
Speaker 0: again.".

91
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:31,513
Speaker 1: Yeah.

92
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:41,830
Speaker 1: They're also, I think the police were alerted, because there were police on my subway car and in Astoria and Union Square and in Times Square.

93
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,590
Speaker 1: It's like the police were alerted and they weren't making any trouble.

94
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,196
Speaker 1: They were just about.

95
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:48,769
Speaker 1: They had their eyes open.

96
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,430
Speaker 0: If you want a real flash mob, you've got to have a group.

97
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,050
Speaker 0: 4chan, Anonymous, they do it well.

98
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,990
Speaker 0: You announce something like today to do tomorrow, and regular world people cannot react fast enough.

99
00:04:59,153 --> 00:04:59,530
Speaker 1: Exactly.

100
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,529
Speaker 0: No pants day has been scheduled for months.

101
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:14,850
Speaker 1: It's like because you said it the day before, only people who check the internet every day will see it, or people who are on the Twitter or something like that will see it and be able to react in time, and local people only also.

102
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:23,970
Speaker 1: As a result, the people will be more willing and more able to execute the instructions properly and more dedicated.

103
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:37,830
Speaker 0: Of course, at the same time, despite all that, I was very happy that I am totally seriously sure that I convinced the nice old lady who offered me a seat next to her that I did in fact lose my pants and I don't know what all these other people are doing.

104
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:38,564
Speaker 1: Is she senile?

105
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:40,528
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

106
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,252
Speaker 1: She's

107
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:51,888
Speaker 0: asking me where I work and I was like, "Yeah, I just left my pants at work and I'm just trying to get home and I think there's this thing, all these other people, She's like, "Yeah, there's some kind of no pants thing, but you just got lucky I

108
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:52,109
Speaker 0: guess.".

109
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,929
Speaker 0: She was totally, I'm pretty sure I got her.

110
00:05:56,693 --> 00:06:01,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, the one funny thing I saw was, well, first of all, in the Astoria train, one guy was freaking out.

111
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,010
Speaker 1: He was just laughing hysterically.

112
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:05,469
Speaker 0: Was he one of us or just some guy?

113
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:05,927
Speaker 1: Just some guy.

114
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:06,549
Speaker 0: Okay, that's good.

115
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,330
Speaker 1: Then in the train, once we got... Oh, I forget.

116
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:13,230
Speaker 1: No, whatever.

117
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,130
Speaker 1: There was a guy sitting in the corner of the subway car.

118
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,370
Speaker 1: He was sleeping and snoring.

119
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:20,150
Speaker 1: He was not a no pants guy.

120
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,768
Speaker 0: So he woke up and then no pants?

121
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,608
Speaker 1: He was just sleeping the entire time.

122
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:25,809
Speaker 1: I did not see him wake up.

123
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,190
Speaker 1: He slept past Union Square.

124
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:34,549
Speaker 0: What I was at least happy with, I got off at 30th Avenue and where I happened to get off was right at the top of the stairs.

125
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:41,750
Speaker 0: So I just stood there kind of pantsless and that was where I got all the kind of interesting reactions.

126
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:46,390
Speaker 0: On the cars, I really didn't get anyone because everyone was like, "All right, there's a bunch of people with no pants.

127
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:48,505
Speaker 0: There's something going

128
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:48,769
Speaker 0: on.".

129
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,270
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll reformulate.

130
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:58,450
Speaker 1: The thing is the formula they have is still so good because you get multiple, you get two platforms and you get two cars.

131
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:05,310
Speaker 0: And you get this kind of quick, like it's too fast for most people to figure it out and react with other people.

132
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,270
Speaker 1: It's like you get all these platforms and you get multiple trains.

133
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:12,481
Speaker 1: Basically, you have the effect on two trains of this gradual.

134
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:13,230
Speaker 1: what the fuck, right?

135
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,970
Speaker 1: Because one guy does it weird.

136
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,390
Speaker 1: Two guys, four guys, eight guys.

137
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,927
Speaker 1: And then the second train comes in and it's one, two, four.

138
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,290
Speaker 1: So you get the build up on two different trains.

139
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,766
Speaker 0: And then people getting off in Union Square are just like, "What the

140
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:27,269
Speaker 0: fuck?".

141
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:31,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at that point, I think it's kind of silly because it's just like everybody has no pants.

142
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, well at that point, what's most fun is, I mean, we got away right away and we walked north and we kept the pants off.

143
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,870
Speaker 0: The reactions were much better when it's just four-pantsless people walking into a bakery to get some hot chocolate because it's cold.

144
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:48,410
Speaker 1: The thing is in New York, the people who are employees of a retail place never freak out about anything.

145
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,710
Speaker 0: Nah, because they're like, "Oh, you're not wearing pants?

146
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:55,570
Speaker 0: A homeless guy came in and pooped all over the table four minutes ago.

147
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,544
Speaker 0: You're not phasing

148
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:56,707
Speaker 0: me.".

149
00:07:57,112 --> 00:08:01,270
Speaker 1: I went to the bank and got two-dollar bills and so far, I've had no trouble whatsoever using them.

150
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,170
Speaker 0: You had to go way upstate and find a Taco Bell.

151
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:04,537
Speaker 1: There's a Wikipedia.

152
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:08,029
Speaker 1: If you look up two-dollar bills on the internet, this is one story about a guy.

153
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,870
Speaker 0: The Park one, yeah, the Taco Bell, two dollars.

154
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,582
Speaker 1: No, this is the Best Buy one.

155
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,548
Speaker 0: Basically, a guy- Oh, separate story.

156
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically the story, I found it in like ten different places on the internet.

157
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,189
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was just copied from one source, though.

158
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,769
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it's true, either.

159
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:32,489
Speaker 1: But basically, a guy had a car stereo installation at Best Buy and they decided that it wasn't a free installation, even though it was supposed to be a free installation.

160
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,570
Speaker 1: He wanted to protest the fact that they were trying to charge him for the supposedly free installation.

161
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,517
Speaker 1: He went and it was $158 or something like that.

162
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,549
Speaker 1: He paid it with 57 two-dollar bills or whatever it comes out to, right?

163
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:48,990
Speaker 1: As a protest, because he worked for some tour group that had two-dollar bills.

164
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,470
Speaker 1: because he used the two-dollar bills so that the people on tours could use them to buy lunch because it was fun.

165
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:56,730
Speaker 1: So he had so many of them and they were sequential or whatever.

166
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,209
Speaker 0: I was going to say he had to have a reason because otherwise- Because he got them from the bank all the time.

167
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,209
Speaker 0: If you're doing the protest payment, it's pennies.

168
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, he got it from the bank all the time because he used them at his job.

169
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,730
Speaker 0: You've got to be like Kramer with that sack of change.

170
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,830
Speaker 1: So as a protest, he paid with these 50 pile of two-dollar bills he got from the bank.

171
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,090
Speaker 0: I take it this ends with police?

172
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,358
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, he was arrested.

173
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:16,326
Speaker 1: Well, he wasn't arrested.

174
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,730
Speaker 1: I don't know if maybe he was arrested.

175
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,628
Speaker 1: He was handcuffed to a pole in the police station, right?

176
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:22,800
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Are you

177
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:23,246
Speaker 1: serious?".

178
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,306
Speaker 1: And then the Secret Service, of course, came and was like, "No, these are

179
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:26,648
Speaker 1: fine.".

180
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:27,910
Speaker 0: You guys are dumbasses.

181
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,863
Speaker 1: You guys are dumbasses.

182
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:29,329
Speaker 1: Let him go.

183
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,850
Speaker 0: So you're unfamiliar then with the most famous two-dollar bill story of all.

184
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,250
Speaker 0: The Fark two dollars.

185
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:40,110
Speaker 1: I'm not going to tell it- If this Best Buy story was ever in the news, I'm pretty sure it would have been posted to Fark.

186
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:47,690
Speaker 0: It probably has been, but it's usually a footnote to the Fark story of a guy who uses a two-dollar bill at a Taco Bell.

187
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:49,381
Speaker 0: I'm not going to tell it.

188
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,008
Speaker 0: Just Google it.

189
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,130
Speaker 0: There's an internet.

190
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,369
Speaker 0: You can get the original story, not my bastardization of it.

191
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,488
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's move on.

192
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,370
Speaker 1: Last year, when there was CES, we didn't have any Monday ideas.

193
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,424
Speaker 1: We did a Monday CES news show.

194
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:05,202
Speaker 0: This year- Wait, wait, my whole news is CES.

195
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:05,806
Speaker 0: Let's see.

196
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,530
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of boring tablets, 3D TVs, and a bunch of phones that no one cares about.

197
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,450
Speaker 1: Anything else?

198
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:15,689
Speaker 1: That's it?

199
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:18,290
Speaker 0: No one is really talking about it.

200
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,190
Speaker 0: I haven't seen anything that really stands out.

201
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,390
Speaker 1: Well, you've got to read Engadget.com.

202
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:29,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm on Engadget, and everything looks- Everything is tablet, tablet, tablet, tablet, phone, tablet, phone, phone, car- It's all like, "Hey, we made an Android tablet.

203
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,407
Speaker 0: It's different from all the other ones in no way

204
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:32,089
Speaker 0: whatsoever.".

205
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:33,490
Speaker 1: No meaningful way, at least.

206
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,270
Speaker 1: I mean, basically, what's really upsetting is that I know for a fact that the CES is gigantic, right?

207
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:48,810
Speaker 1: And that I'm sure while the vast majority of things that would get traffic to a site like Engadget are things like Android tablets and other things that have very good search terms in them, right?

208
00:10:49,430 --> 00:11:02,470
Speaker 1: But I'm also confident that if I was actually at the CES, there'd be a bunch of weird booths of things that no one thinks about that no one cares about, so they're not going to be posted to Engadget, but are probably interesting, and we will not see them.

209
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,250
Speaker 0: You've got to find some nerd blogger and read whatever he writes, some guy who went.

210
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we- you know, the thing is- Trivial amounts of journalism would figure this out.

211
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:19,269
Speaker 1: The thing is all the tech journalists talk about how they hate going to CES, so I'm like, "Huh, do I really want to go to it, or not, you know, if I

212
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:19,330
Speaker 1: go?".

213
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,013
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:24,290
Speaker 0: So you're a tech journalist, and you hate doing your job.

215
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,067
Speaker 1: Well, they talk about how, like, "Why should I, you know-".

216
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,100
Speaker 0: "Why should I

217
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,790
Speaker 0: journalize?".

218
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,528
Speaker 1: Well, these are not the journalists that go- That I'm looking for?

219
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,435
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Engadget guys go because they're taking pictures and saying, "Look at this thing.

220
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:37,162
Speaker 1: Look at this thing.

221
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:37,950
Speaker 1: Look at this thing," right?

222
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,110
Speaker 1: But really, most of what they're doing amounts to regurgitating the press releases to the masses, right?

223
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,850
Speaker 1: They're taking this message that is being broadcast in a very small place and broadcasting it to the internet.

224
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,490
Speaker 1: A lot of the other- the tech journalists that hate going are the kind of guys who opine, you know?

225
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,588
Speaker 1: They say, "Oh, the iPhone, it is- will do

226
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:56,990
Speaker 1: badly.".

227
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,899
Speaker 1: You know, they don't need to actually be there.

228
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,309
Speaker 1: They can just read Engadget and then opine, like us!

229
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,763
Speaker 1: They basically do what we're doing right now for a living.

230
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:04,689
Speaker 1: They don't want to go.

231
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,776
Speaker 1: But anyway- I'll go.

232
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:07,849
Speaker 0: I'll take your job.

233
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll go at least once to see what it's about, and if it's good, I'll go again.

234
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,089
Speaker 1: And if it sucks, I won't go again, you know?

235
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,450
Speaker 0: I don't know how much fun we'd actually have there when I think about it, though.

236
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

237
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,870
Speaker 0: I've hated pretty much every trade convention I've ever been to.

238
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just a- it's not-.

239
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:30,770
Speaker 1: the thing is, the only thing I think that saves CES from being just a room full of boobs is that it's like 10 rooms and 30 hotels full of boobs.

240
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:36,810
Speaker 1: At the very least, you can always go to a new place with new boobs and maybe meet somebody, you know?

241
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,210
Speaker 0: But it seems like 3D TVs and tablets are, like, the big thing, and every tablet looks like an iPad.

242
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,753
Speaker 1: Really?

243
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,950
Speaker 1: Have you noticed all these, like, phones that look like the iPhone?

244
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,787
Speaker 0: Except they don't work like the iPhone.

245
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,610
Speaker 1: No kidding.

246
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,405
Speaker 0: If only the iPhone were on some other carrier, I'd probably have one.

247
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:56,410
Speaker 0: But that'll never happen.

248
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:57,267
Speaker 1: Oh, sure?

249
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,215
Speaker 1: Never.

250
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,290
Speaker 1: It'll never happen.

251
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:00,016
Speaker 1: We'll see.

252
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,850
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that in a couple weeks.

253
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,950
Speaker 0: That thing that won't happen?

254
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,030
Speaker 1: Tomorrow, actually.

255
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:05,610
Speaker 0: That won't happen tomorrow?

256
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,550
Speaker 1: Or today, if you're listening to this tomorrow.

257
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,790
Speaker 0: If you're listening to it tomorrow, you can't- by definition, if you're listening to it, it's today.

258
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:16,247
Speaker 1: No, because today is the day that I am saying this, not the day you're listening to it.

259
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,386
Speaker 0: Scott, this is much like the bar that has the clever sign in the window that says "Free Beer

260
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:20,869
Speaker 0: Tomorrow.".

261
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

262
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,930
Speaker 0: So, is there any news to talk about at all?

263
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, this news is not related to the CES.

264
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:38,610
Speaker 1: So, whether or not you knew this or not, or not, or not, VLC is a program that allows you to watch videos and also listen to audios.

265
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,130
Speaker 1: And it actually does a whole bunch of other video audio related stuff, too, if you can figure out how to make it do that.

266
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:48,370
Speaker 1: And the one thing about VLC is that, you know, it can play pretty much anything.

267
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,930
Speaker 0: It's very popular among Mac users, and it's very popular in general among people who can't get MPlayer to work.

268
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,670
Speaker 0: Because it's slower, but it just works.

269
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like it has a GUI, right?

270
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,890
Speaker 0: That GUI's like half there.

271
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,897
Speaker 1: It's a bad GUI.

272
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:06,580
Speaker 0: So, it's like people who- Granted, there is that GUI- Well, there's that GUI for MPlayer.

273
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,069
Speaker 0: that's way worse than the VLC GUI.

274
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,337
Speaker 1: Well, actually, there's one good GUI for MPlayer.

275
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:13,610
Speaker 1: is the MPlayer OS X Extended, right?

276
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:14,429
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah.

277
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,930
Speaker 1: It's like the MPlayer++ that's on the Mac.

278
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:20,510
Speaker 1: But there's no good MPlayer GUIs for Windows or Linux or anything.

279
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:29,710
Speaker 1: Anyway, so VLC was actually released for iTunes in the iTunes store for the iPhone and iPad, I guess.

280
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,470
Speaker 1: I don't know for the iPad, but definitely for the iPhone.

281
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:34,314
Speaker 1: And people were like, "What?

282
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,236
Speaker 1: It's GPL.

283
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:41,450
Speaker 1: That means you have to be open with the source and you can't add DRMs because it's GPL 3 and how is it-" you know.

284
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:49,450
Speaker 1: So, basically, they added it to the store and it was accepted, but they did it mostly as an experiment to then challenge.

285
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:51,681
Speaker 1: To be like, "Okay, there's a GPL thing in the store.

286
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,168
Speaker 1: Now, Apple, obey the

287
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:53,410
Speaker 1: GPL.".

288
00:14:56,055 --> 00:15:01,869
Speaker 0: So, a bunch of nerds were like, "Let's make some trouble and then complain about the trouble we

289
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:02,150
Speaker 0: made.".

290
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,451
Speaker 1: Well, no.

291
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:08,610
Speaker 1: I think what it was is more like they knew that pretty much what was going to happen is they were going to remove VLC from the store.

292
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,575
Speaker 1: And that is the news.

293
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:10,439
Speaker 1: That is what happened.

294
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,450
Speaker 1: Apple removed VLC from the store and that's that.

295
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:19,330
Speaker 0: But all the news I see of people talking about it is saying, "Evil Apple removed VLC when everyone watched

296
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,390
Speaker 0: it.".

297
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,530
Speaker 1: That's because people don't know the whole story.

298
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, because really the story is- Right.

299
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,874
Speaker 1: The real story is basically what they did.

300
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,196
Speaker 1: is they said, "Okay, Apple, look.

301
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:32,390
Speaker 1: We're going to give you- here's a chance for you to be awesome to the open source, cool people, right?

302
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,835
Speaker 1: Here is your opportunity to make good.

303
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:41,970
Speaker 1: We know that odds are you're just going to make bad because that's how you do and that's what everything of history of your behavior has told us.

304
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,763
Speaker 1: But look, we're going to give you a chance to make good.

305
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:45,948
Speaker 1: Here's your chance to make

306
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:46,149
Speaker 1: good.".

307
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,104
Speaker 1: And they didn't make good, so it's like,

308
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:48,165
Speaker 1: "Ah.".

309
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,077
Speaker 0: What's funny is that they accepted the app.

310
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,026
Speaker 0: They were like, "All right, let's

311
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:52,448
Speaker 0: play.".

312
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:56,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then- Now you must obey the GPL.

313
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,267
Speaker 1: No, we're going to remove the app rather than obey the GPL.

314
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:00,916
Speaker 1: So?

315
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,268
Speaker 0: Effectively obeying the GPL.

316
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,070
Speaker 1: I know, but the thing is it's so weird because there's a lot of people out there who say things.

317
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:11,356
Speaker 1: They try to praise Apple for its open source-ness, right?

318
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,118
Speaker 1: They'd be like, "Oh, look.

319
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:18,349
Speaker 1: Apple open sourced Darwin kernel and Apple open sourced the- what's it

320
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:18,650
Speaker 1: called?".

321
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,382
Speaker 0: Well, Apple is very good at open sourcing the things- The LLVM, right?

322
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,870
Speaker 0: That don't matter.

323
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:34,986
Speaker 1: Apple open sourced- well, the LLVM kind of matters, but the point is they try to praise Apple for being so open source friendly compared to the evil closed source Microsoft, but it's like, "Well, look.

324
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,589
Speaker 1: Here was their chance to be open source friendly and they were

325
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:38,010
Speaker 1: dickheads.".

326
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,404
Speaker 0: But at the same time, that's their proprietary DRM distribution system.

327
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:47,050
Speaker 0: You can just download and install VLC.

328
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:47,550
Speaker 1: You know.

329
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:55,026
Speaker 1: what they could have done though is all they really could have done to make this work is they could have just kept VLC in the store with no DRM on it.

330
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,110
Speaker 1: That would have sufficed.

331
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, why bother?

332
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,590
Speaker 0: People who want VLC will just know where to get it anyway.

333
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not for your iPhone.

334
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, but do you need it on your iPhone?

335
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:08,329
Speaker 0: What can your iPhone not play?

336
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,969
Speaker 1: The iPhone can only play two video codecs.

337
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, and for people who use iPhones?

338
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,040
Speaker 1: It can only play flash videos if they're from YouTube.

339
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:22,170
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it can only play H.264s and that's pretty much it.

340
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,433
Speaker 0: So, what percentage?

341
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:24,435
Speaker 0: Here's the operative question.

342
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:26,741
Speaker 0: We care because we're people who care about this sort of thing.

343
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:30,070
Speaker 0: How many people out there would ever even realize this is a problem?

344
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:40,670
Speaker 1: I think there are actually quite a few people who they do handbrakes or they have videos that they've made that they want to watch on their iPhones or iPads.

345
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,130
Speaker 0: I see most of the people I see complaining online.

346
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,703
Speaker 1: What happens is these people are now currently, they're not complaining because they're re-encoding the videos.

347
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:51,730
Speaker 1: They're converting them and it takes a while, but they don't mind because they don't know any better.

348
00:17:52,171 --> 00:18:01,810
Speaker 1: But if they realized, "Aha, there was a way to do this without spending all this time re-encoding," they would be very happy, but they don't know that, so they just re-encode not knowing there's a better world.

349
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,739
Speaker 0: But most of the people I see complaining about this sort of thing are basically, they're one step before that.

350
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,367
Speaker 0: They're much less technical and they're people who basically say, "Yeah, these videos just are broken.

351
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:13,469
Speaker 0: They won't play on my Apple

352
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:13,729
Speaker 0: stuff.".

353
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,810
Speaker 0: And they don't even get past that point.

354
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,143
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you could tell them, "If you use the VLC, then they work," they'd be like, "Oh, all right," and they'd be good.

355
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,728
Speaker 0: But now you can't tell them that.

356
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:30,710
Speaker 0: This kind of segues right into the main topic because there's two, the diametric worlds of, and it's weird because Linux, for most people who use it...

357
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,113
Speaker 1: Don't segue to the main topic when you've got a piece of the day.

358
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:57,060
Speaker 0: Well, we'll get to that in the next half of the show because it's time for things of the day.

359
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,443
Speaker 0: So we were watching these.

360
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:05,960
Speaker 0: Chie, our good friend, told us about these a while ago, and we were reminded of them over the crazy front row crew New Year's party.

361
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:07,109
Speaker 1: I don't know why you're saying we.

362
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:07,895
Speaker 1: I never saw this before.

363
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:08,520
Speaker 1: you just showed it to me.

364
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:09,599
Speaker 1: You were in the room.

365
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,140
Speaker 1: I was probably playing a game in a different room.

366
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,569
Speaker 0: We were all watching these.

367
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,060
Speaker 0: You were definitely in the room.

368
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:15,780
Speaker 1: I did not watch.

369
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,860
Speaker 0: You definitely were there.

370
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:17,499
Speaker 1: I did not see.

371
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,127
Speaker 0: I'll agree.

372
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:18,920
Speaker 0: You did not see.

373
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:21,520
Speaker 1: I was in a different room or I was in a different apartment.

374
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,307
Speaker 0: But we watched them multiple times, in fact.

375
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,979
Speaker 0: But this is Sundance, some videos, green porno.

376
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,579
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

377
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:39,120
Speaker 0: Isabella Rossellini basically tells you how different animals have sex in hilarious paper mache cardboard cutout form.

378
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:39,913
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

379
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:45,040
Speaker 0: The B one is the best one, at least for getting an introduction to what this sort of thing is like.

380
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,530
Speaker 1: Oh, why did you show me the best one first?

381
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,819
Speaker 1: Because now the other one's going to be meh.

382
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:48,944
Speaker 0: Uh, no.

383
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,214
Speaker 0: They're all pretty much like 99% as good as the B one.

384
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,968
Speaker 1: I'm going to tell you something, though.

385
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,499
Speaker 1: I'm glad I'm not a B.

386
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,653
Speaker 0: Just for the line at the end where he's like, "Now I will die without my

387
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:01,175
Speaker 0: penis.".

388
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:02,379
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

389
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:04,425
Speaker 1: Who does that?

390
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:06,059
Speaker 1: It sounds like someone I know.

391
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:08,579
Speaker 0: You may know him.

392
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:09,739
Speaker 1: I think you might know him.

393
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,223
Speaker 0: So, that's it.

394
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,689
Speaker 0: There's like a million videos.

395
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,694
Speaker 0: They're all short.

396
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,100
Speaker 0: They're incredibly worth watching.

397
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,106
Speaker 0: The show is called Seduce Me.

398
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:18,190
Speaker 0: You might have seen this.

399
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,260
Speaker 0: I think one Daily Show way back showed one about bedbugs.

400
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,500
Speaker 0: And one of the worst words, well, combination of words I've ever heard in my life, traumatic insemination.

401
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

402
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,463
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, how about ducks with their friggin'- Ducks.

403
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:34,695
Speaker 0: Ducks are motherfucking rapists.

404
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,540
Speaker 0: Let me tell you what.

405
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,144
Speaker 1: That's right.

406
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:37,031
Speaker 1: Watch out.

407
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:38,060
Speaker 1: Donald's coming to get you.

408
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:42,951
Speaker 1: All right.

409
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,180
Speaker 1: So, check this out, right?

410
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:44,620
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

411
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,260
Speaker 1: If you take someone to a big open field or perhaps, I don't know, salt flats- And what, rape them like a duck?

412
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,721
Speaker 1: Sure.

413
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,432
Speaker 1: And then you put a blindfold on them and you just say, "All right, listen.

414
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,899
Speaker 1: You can't see anything, but walk in a straight

415
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,100
Speaker 1: line.".

416
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,803
Speaker 1: And they're not cheating.

417
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,110
Speaker 1: They're not peeking out of the blindfold.

418
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,220
Speaker 1: Maybe just put a sack over their heads so they really can't see.

419
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:03,132
Speaker 1: And you say, "All right, you're blindfolded.

420
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,079
Speaker 1: Walk in a straight

421
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:04,220
Speaker 1: line.".

422
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:14,196
Speaker 1: People think they're walking in a straight line, but really, no matter how many times you do this experiment, people always walk in sort of like a corkscrew circle.

423
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:14,960
Speaker 1: They veer to the right.

424
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,174
Speaker 0: It seems to always be to the right.

425
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,100
Speaker 0: That's the weirdest part.

426
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,709
Speaker 1: And people have tried it swimming.

427
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,541
Speaker 1: They've tried it with different- Driving.

428
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,347
Speaker 1: They've tried it with different genders.

429
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,530
Speaker 1: They've tried it with different heights.

430
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,900
Speaker 1: They've tried it with left-handed, right-handed, ambidextrous people.

431
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:32,140
Speaker 0: What about wheelchairs?

432
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,980
Speaker 1: I don't know, but they've tried just about everything.

433
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:45,620
Speaker 1: Because if I just hold forward on my motorized wheelchair- They're still trying, and they still can't figure it out, but what they do know is that if you have some sort of point of reference, you can walk straight.

434
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,497
Speaker 1: But if you don't have one, people cannot walk straight, no matter how much they think they're walking straight.

435
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,440
Speaker 1: They'll start to walk in a circle.

436
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,720
Speaker 1: It does make sense, because I remember as a kid, one of the things you learn- We know that this is what happens, but we don't know why.

437
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:03,100
Speaker 0: One of the things you learn when you're camping, and if you've ever spent a lot of time in the outdoors, is that you cannot trust your own sense of direction in a forest.

438
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,860
Speaker 0: You will go in circles if you try to just walk straight.

439
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:08,860
Speaker 1: Imagine the path or something.

440
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then, you'll lose the path, and then you'll go in a circle, and you'll find the path again, and then you'll go in the same circle.

441
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:24,260
Speaker 0: In fact, the path often makes it worse, because you'll be on the path, veer off the path onto a deer trail, come full circle, you'll find the path again like, "Yes, I got

442
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,340
Speaker 0: it!"

443
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:25,840
Speaker 0: And you'll be right back where you started.

444
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:28,160
Speaker 1: This is why you need a compass.

445
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:41,120
Speaker 0: The thing is, I feel like, with the knowledge of how this study worked, if I did this myself ten times and figured out how much I tend to veer, I would stop every hundred steps, turn a little bit to the left, and then continue.

446
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:49,520
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I don't know why the car one failed, because if I had a car in the salt flats, I'd basically just step on the gas and not touch the wheel.

447
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,030
Speaker 0: It's got alignment shifts.

448
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,000
Speaker 0: You hit any bump, and now you're going a different direction.

449
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:54,800
Speaker 1: It's a salt flat.

450
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,680
Speaker 0: It's not perfectly flat, Scott.

451
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,049
Speaker 1: The salt flat is perfectly flat.

452
00:22:58,089 --> 00:22:59,720
Speaker 1: That's why they do the test drives there.

453
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,020
Speaker 0: It's pretty flat, but there are imperfections you are likely to run into.

454
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,514
Speaker 1: Alright, I would hold the wheel and not move my hand.

455
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,560
Speaker 1: Right in the middle.

456
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,799
Speaker 0: I'll bet you would subconsciously move it a little bit.

457
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:09,357
Speaker 0: No.

458
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,219
Speaker 0: And not realize it.

459
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,220
Speaker 1: I can hold it right in the middle.

460
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,200
Speaker 0: Scott, try to hold your hand perfectly straight and not move it at all.

461
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,540
Speaker 1: Alright.

462
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,111
Speaker 0: Alright, on something that can move.

463
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:19,096
Speaker 0: A wheel of some kind.

464
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:19,880
Speaker 0: Just in the air.

465
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,171
Speaker 1: My knee can move, but...

466
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,780
Speaker 0: Your knee has more resistance, and I see you moving.

467
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,419
Speaker 1: I can just put my knee up against the wheel.

468
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,114
Speaker 1: I do not move it.

469
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,400
Speaker 1: I think it will.

470
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:32,520
Speaker 0: So you think that all these studies... total bullshit, because no one's smarter than you.

471
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:33,619
Speaker 1: I think I could do it.

472
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:34,640
Speaker 0: You think you could do it.

473
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:35,100
Speaker 1: I could do it.

474
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,663
Speaker 0: Tell you what.

475
00:23:35,723 --> 00:23:36,447
Speaker 0: You rent a car.

476
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:38,600
Speaker 0: Let's get out on the Queensborough Bridge.

477
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,459
Speaker 0: Let's try this.

478
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,958
Speaker 1: Why don't we do it somewhere safe?

479
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:43,060
Speaker 1: Where there's a lot of straightness.

480
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,887
Speaker 0: But I thought you could do it.

481
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,260
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a straight road.

482
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,660
Speaker 1: Because then I would be blindfolded, so I wouldn't see the cars in front of me stopping.

483
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,891
Speaker 0: So we'll go like 2 a.m.

484
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:51,660
Speaker 0: when there's no cars.

485
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,179
Speaker 1: There are cars at 2 a.m.

486
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,780
Speaker 0: Not so much on the Queensborough Bridge.

487
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,000
Speaker 0: There's plenty of cars at 2 a.m If you go at 5 miles an hour, you won't run into anyone.

488
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Speaker 1: Instead, they'll come up and smash into my ass and honk like hell.

489
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,838
Speaker 1: And then I'll know what direction I'm going in for sure.

490
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,754
Speaker 1: Because we'll be honking, which is a point of reference.

491
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:09,540
Speaker 1: It needs to be quiet.

492
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
Speaker 0: So very briefly, the meta moment.

493
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,660
Speaker 0: This weekend, we will be at MAGFest.

494
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:15,936
Speaker 1: MAGFest.

495
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,612
Speaker 1: What?

496
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,564
Speaker 1: What?

497
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,166
Speaker 1: What?

498
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:20,260
Speaker 1: I don't think you're very good at it.

499
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,133
Speaker 0: I'm not very good at it.

500
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:21,539
Speaker 0: Neither are you.

501
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:22,248
Speaker 0: Me too.

502
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:22,535
Speaker 1: I'm great.

503
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,217
Speaker 0: We'll wait until we get there and hear other people doing it.

504
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:29,080
Speaker 0: It's more like a... Like he charges up.

505
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,759
Speaker 1: You're trying too hard.

506
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,760
Speaker 1: That's better.

507
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:35,420
Speaker 1: You're enunciating too much.

508
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,499
Speaker 0: Anyway, we'll be at MAGFest doing 3 panels.

509
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,810
Speaker 0: We got the schedule.

510
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,620
Speaker 0: I put it in the link.

511
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,340
Speaker 0: So if you want to know when our panels are, if you're going to be at MAGFest, outside of those, we'll just be chilling, hanging out.

512
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,219
Speaker 1: There are some panels in the schedule that look like they would be our panels, but they're someone else's panels.

513
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm curious.

514
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:50,800
Speaker 0: I might go to some of these panels.

515
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,740
Speaker 1: There's a match game.

516
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,019
Speaker 1: There's like a storytelling and tabletop role-playing game.

517
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,620
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone else do a match game at the cons we've ever been to.

518
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,340
Speaker 0: I'm curious to see if they do it well.

519
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:04,980
Speaker 1: Actually, some of the events are pretty creative, like the Iron Chef, where they're actually going to cook with a George Foreman in a microwave.

520
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:09,419
Speaker 0: I wonder how they're getting away with that, because there's no way we could get away with that at like Kinetic Con.

521
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,999
Speaker 1: Where would we get enough George Foremans in enough microwaves?

522
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,356
Speaker 0: Where are we going to get the hotel to say, "Yeah, you can plug 10 George Foremans into this

523
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:16,658
Speaker 0: room.".

524
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:18,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can plug in 10 microwaves.

525
00:25:18,242 --> 00:25:18,920
Speaker 1: No trouble here.

526
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,339
Speaker 1: Run them all simultaneously.

527
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,140
Speaker 0: MAGFest seems like a con that gets in vague trouble with a hotel every year.

528
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:26,820
Speaker 0: I'm just getting that impression.

529
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,020
Speaker 1: Maybe they found a hotel that like loves that shit.

530
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,325
Speaker 0: It's possible.

531
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,320
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a hotel that no one else uses.

532
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,080
Speaker 0: They're just desperate.

533
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:33,633
Speaker 1: Maybe.

534
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,719
Speaker 0: They hate them, but they have nothing they can do about it.

535
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:36,354
Speaker 1: I don't know.

536
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,800
Speaker 0: We'll see, but MAGFest is going to be pretty awesome.

537
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,100
Speaker 0: We got other cons coming up, like PAX East and everything.

538
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,120
Speaker 0: Book Club book is Michio Kaku's Hyperspace.

539
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,248
Speaker 1: I started reading.

540
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:45,220
Speaker 1: I read the introduction.

541
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:45,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good book.

542
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:46,976
Speaker 0: Yeah?

543
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,740
Speaker 0: You're saying it's not?

544
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,360
Speaker 0: Are you going to prejudge this amazing book?

545
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,780
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying I read the introduction.

546
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,019
Speaker 1: I can't really say either way.

547
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,619
Speaker 0: How was the introduction on a scale of 1 to 10 of introductions?

548
00:25:57,121 --> 00:26:02,979
Speaker 1: It wasn't really a good introduction because it wasn't Neil Gaiman, who is the greatest introduction writer of all time.

549
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,020
Speaker 0: I would love to see a book that is a coffee table book, just introductions by Neil Gaiman.

550
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,837
Speaker 1: That was my idea.

551
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,220
Speaker 0: In fact, he should write the introduction to his own book.

552
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,340
Speaker 1: That was my idea for that to happen, but I tried to tell him that idea.

553
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,978
Speaker 1: He didn't say anything.

554
00:26:15,962 --> 00:26:16,778
Speaker 1: He wasn't reading his tweets.

555
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:17,740
Speaker 1: That day.

556
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,900
Speaker 0: You should have told him at PenguinCon 2.

557
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,837
Speaker 1: I didn't have the idea then.

558
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,539
Speaker 1: I had the idea more recently.

559
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,174
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll write him a letter on paper.

560
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:25,619
Speaker 1: He'll read that.

561
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,869
Speaker 0: I remember back in, I don't know, 1996, give or take?

562
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,643
Speaker 1: '97 or '98.

563
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:32,759
Speaker 0: If I may.

564
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,920
Speaker 0: That was a different time, you understand.

565
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:49,560
Speaker 0: That Oracle was one of many companies saying that the desktop was dead and that it was going to be a short span of time before everyone is using thin clients, proprietary thin clients, everything is going to be up in a cluster, going to be up in a cloud of some kind, and PCs are going to be dead.

566
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:53,040
Speaker 0: Part of this was to lock down the experience.

567
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:56,773
Speaker 1: DRM, Oracle was way ahead of its time for being evil.

568
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:01,238
Speaker 1: They weren't thinking about the evil DRMs at that point, right?

569
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,180
Speaker 0: They were thinking about the lockdown, the support, verified code.

570
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:09,000
Speaker 0: You don't need any local data store because trust us, we've got it.

571
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:17,995
Speaker 1: What they were thinking about was mostly, "Look, you had to keep giving us money even after you bought the computer because we actually have the computer and you

572
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:18,237
Speaker 1: don't.".

573
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:21,240
Speaker 1: That's mostly the core of what they were thinking about.

574
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there was a lot of talk about protected data streams.

575
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,321
Speaker 1: Right.

576
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:34,898
Speaker 1: Well, part of the reason for that was they wanted to be, it was like, "Well, look, this benefits the customer because their computer will just always work and it will be cheaper to buy the computer even though they'll have to pay us

577
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:35,300
Speaker 1: monthly.".

578
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,520
Speaker 0: Now, the nerds said no.

579
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,539
Speaker 1: And it'll be so secure.

580
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:46,000
Speaker 0: The nerds said, "I want the power to run whatever code I want and have whatever data I want with no one else having access to it.

581
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:47,050
Speaker 0: I can handle

582
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,272
Speaker 0: that.".

583
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,380
Speaker 0: And things went around for a while.

584
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,288
Speaker 0: When I was at IBM, I--.

585
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,680
Speaker 1: Well, I think mostly the reason that that didn't work at the time wasn't due to lack of trying.

586
00:27:58,522 --> 00:28:06,119
Speaker 1: It was that the desktops had caught on mostly because of the Apple II and what came after it and the IBM PC and what came after it.

587
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,379
Speaker 1: It had caught on already.

588
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:12,580
Speaker 1: There was an existing base of software and things that people did with computers and that was the platform.

589
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,751
Speaker 1: It was the PC platform.

590
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,419
Speaker 1: It was locked in.

591
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,200
Speaker 1: Games are coming out for it, right?

592
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:23,520
Speaker 1: So you couldn't really compete with it because you didn't have the network bandwidth to the house to compete with it.

593
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:28,860
Speaker 0: Well, see, for the home user, I don't think that was on the horizon yet because where this was expected to happen was in business.

594
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:44,939
Speaker 0: If you hadn't interrupted my anecdote, when I worked at IBM, which was 2003, give or take, I came into possession of several thousand thin clients that were designed to connect to a thin client server and do all that stuff.

595
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:46,440
Speaker 0: They had RAM.

596
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:59,800
Speaker 0: They had a little CPU that was just strong enough to get the data and do whatever it needed to do, a little bit of local processing power, and a network card, and almost nothing else, an output for a serial port and keyboard inputs and everything.

597
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:06,799
Speaker 1: There's a place on the fourth floor of the building I work in and the whole middle of the room is just all these thin clients.

598
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,699
Speaker 0: So you know why we got these?

599
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,539
Speaker 0: Because nobody wanted them because they were completely useless.

600
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,200
Speaker 0: They were so slow and so obsolete, so fast.

601
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:18,940
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

602
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Speaker 0: This was in enterprise environments where we did have the bandwidth.

603
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,220
Speaker 0: We had plenty of bandwidth.

604
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,800
Speaker 0: Bandwidth was not the limiting factor.

605
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,100
Speaker 0: The limiting factor ended up being that, one, the servers weren't fast enough to deal with all these clients.

606
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,939
Speaker 0: Two, the local clients were slow as balls.

607
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:36,240
Speaker 1: Thin clients are a little better now for business purposes.

608
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:43,600
Speaker 1: There's actually plenty of businesses, mostly where they have a bunch of workers doing the same exact task with a simple interface.

609
00:29:44,902 --> 00:29:47,680
Speaker 1: For example, the place on the fourth floor of my building is an apartment place.

610
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:52,120
Speaker 1: All anyone does in any of those computers is search for apartments in a little browser.

611
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:54,720
Speaker 1: They have just a field of thin clients.

612
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,159
Speaker 1: People just search and that's all they do.

613
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,767
Speaker 0: But what brand?

614
00:29:56,787 --> 00:29:57,920
Speaker 0: Are they actually thin clients?

615
00:29:58,445 --> 00:29:59,700
Speaker 0: Or are they data-less clients?

616
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,239
Speaker 1: No, they're those YA's things.

617
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:06,400
Speaker 0: But most people use, when they call thin clients, they're actually data-less clients.

618
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,300
Speaker 0: They're usually a Linux box with a hard drive and a CPU.

619
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:14,040
Speaker 1: These are one of those things where you turn it on and you get ghetto windows.

620
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,240
Speaker 1: All it has in the ghetto windows is some sort of Windows remote desktop kind of client thing.

621
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:25,400
Speaker 0: Most thin clients in the older days used Citrix-like things and would even get the desktop from afar.

622
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:27,052
Speaker 0: They had nothing locally.

623
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:31,340
Speaker 0: If there's anything local, it's not technically a thin client.

624
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:42,940
Speaker 0: It's a data-less client in that it has a minimal system to do what you need locally and has local processing power, but all the application logic and all the data is stored somewhere else.

625
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:59,339
Speaker 1: This is basically a situation where you have either a VMware server or a Windows server, whatever, and all the actual computing happens on this server or cluster of servers and people just remote into it with remote desktop kind of situations, and that's how it works.

626
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,920
Speaker 0: I got rid of those thin clients, and you know what I replaced them with?

627
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:09,400
Speaker 0: Linux PCs, because they were cheaper and easier to maintain and a thousand times more powerful.

628
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:17,898
Speaker 0: And the best part is, what a lot of people didn't foresee that I think was really the death of that old south thin client was web apps.

629
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,280
Speaker 0: Web apps meant that it didn't matter what was on the end, because when you had these thin clients, you had to have all this kind of specialized software.

630
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,380
Speaker 0: There was no open, general framework.

631
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,420
Speaker 0: Everyone had their own proprietary bullshit solution.

632
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,240
Speaker 0: With a web app, you really literally didn't care.

633
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,520
Speaker 0: As long as they had IE3 or up, it just worked.

634
00:31:36,443 --> 00:31:37,009
Speaker 1: Yeah.

635
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,900
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the one thing.

636
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:42,540
Speaker 1: The web started out as just sort of like mostly an information thing.

637
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:46,315
Speaker 1: It was almost like an encyclopedia where anyone could make a page or edit pages.

638
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:53,119
Speaker 1: People weren't thinking of it being an application platform, so other things like the Citrix.

639
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,700
Speaker 1: It's like, well, an application runs in the desktop, and if you need to serve an application over the network, you need something like exporting or remote desktop.

640
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:01,599
Speaker 1: You need something.

641
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,660
Speaker 1: But only because the browsers and the JavaScript and everything became more powerful did web apps actually happen.

642
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:12,499
Speaker 1: It's like, no, shit, everything's in the browser now.

643
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,300
Speaker 1: So we got to the same place they were thinking.

644
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:17,940
Speaker 1: We just didn't take the route that they were expecting to get there.

645
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,480
Speaker 0: But there was definitely this aspect of the media.

646
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,420
Speaker 0: People talked a lot about how eventually no one will have a local PC anymore.

647
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:35,139
Speaker 0: They will just have some sort of client that gets them to the data that we host, and no one will run their own applications, no one will write their own applications, no one will have local storage.

648
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,740
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, people are also thinking about this general idea.

649
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:41,440
Speaker 1: It's like the idea of the appliance computer.

650
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,760
Speaker 1: That's what they wanted back in the day, at least.

651
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,240
Speaker 1: They were like, why are we giving normal people these computers that are actually full-on computers?

652
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,610
Speaker 1: Normal people want a toaster.

653
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,180
Speaker 1: They should have an appliance that's as easy to use as a microwave.

654
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:01,880
Speaker 1: You know, push a button that says play game, and push a button that says, you know, read encyclopedia, and push a button that says, you know, whatever.

655
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,440
Speaker 0: And there were a ton of attempts at things like that.

656
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,080
Speaker 1: They all failed until the iPhone.

657
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:09,498
Speaker 0: Well, there were some early -- remember the original iMacs?

658
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:11,360
Speaker 1: That was not an appliance.

659
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,720
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't, but it was close.

660
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:16,380
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it ran OS X. It was not an appliance in any way.

661
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,752
Speaker 0: But the way they were presented to people -- In fact, it didn't run OS X.

662
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:19,520
Speaker 1: It ran OS 9.

663
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,220
Speaker 0: But the way they were presented to people, and the way they were bundled, they were bought by people with the expectation that they would work mostly like an appliance.

664
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,780
Speaker 0: They had their big buttons, and they do very simple, focused things.

665
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,240
Speaker 1: It was -- no, it didn't have these soft -- you know, I mean, it was -- hardware-wise, it was all-in-one, you know, thing, but that was nothing new.

666
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:38,060
Speaker 1: The original Mac was all-in-one, right?

667
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:39,120
Speaker 1: It'd be appliance --.

668
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was like lost precursor technology to most computer users by then.

669
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:54,189
Speaker 1: But the true idea of an appliance computer that actually succeeded, that people actually bought in any number was, you know, the first iPhone, which, you know -- Well, that's way later.

670
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:55,300
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm talking about the old days.

671
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,639
Speaker 0: This was basically a first step.

672
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:08,699
Speaker 0: It was a move in that direction, not to the data-less PC or the thin client, but to the appliance PC, which was a very different direction from what Oracle and a lot of people really wanted to push the industry.

673
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,550
Speaker 0: But nerds from the start were like, "Fuck you.

674
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:13,975
Speaker 0: I'm not letting you touch my data.

675
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:14,516
Speaker 0: It's mine.

676
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:15,099
Speaker 1: Damn

677
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:15,179
Speaker 1: it.".

678
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:15,759
Speaker 1: That's right.

679
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,456
Speaker 0: And they pretty much lost, and PCs really took over.

680
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:20,059
Speaker 0: Everyone had PCs.

681
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,900
Speaker 0: There was a whole era where the whole thing was like every nerd was building their own PC.

682
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,239
Speaker 0: There was like Renaissance of PC building.

683
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there was Dell and Gateway and all those things.

684
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:31,440
Speaker 0: Remember, like, CompUSA?

685
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

686
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:40,159
Speaker 0: And basically, everyone forgot about this argument, and suddenly it's coming back again, and I don't think anyone forgot about it.

687
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,460
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people forgot about it.

688
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,739
Speaker 1: No, I think it's just that it's finally -- you know, a big movement came much too quickly, right?

689
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:52,896
Speaker 1: It was like the App Store, and then it exploded before people realized, "Aw, shit, the appliance appeared when we were least

690
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:53,277
Speaker 1: looking.".

691
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:54,119
Speaker 0: There it is.

692
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,380
Speaker 0: See, outside of tech circles, no one was even thinking about that.

693
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,873
Speaker 0: They'd already forgotten about the whole movement.

694
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:58,579
Speaker 0: They had their PC.

695
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,199
Speaker 0: They upgraded it every few years, and they just never thought about it.

696
00:35:02,882 --> 00:35:05,040
Speaker 0: And then suddenly, iPads and iPhones.

697
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:12,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that, you know, the main problem here is you get this argument that goes on, and the argument goes something like this, right?

698
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:21,476
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, this is so great because now my computer is easy to use, and it never breaks, and it's secure, and my grandma can even use it.

699
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:21,818
Speaker 1: It's so

700
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,080
Speaker 1: easy.".

701
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,859
Speaker 1: But then the nerd says -- And it does everything that I want it to do.

702
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,379
Speaker 0: The nerd, you know, like me, says, "But I want to do this particular thing, and I don't want to have anyone else control whether or not I do that

703
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:31,500
Speaker 0: thing.".

704
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,560
Speaker 1: Well, you can still use your hard-to-use computer, but no one else needs to use that hard-to-use computer.

705
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,060
Speaker 1: Everyone else can live happy with their managed computer experience.

706
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:55,579
Speaker 0: Of course, one interesting way to look at this is look at the difference between a Windows PC, where if I want an application, I go to, you know, thisismalware.ru, and I download an .exe file, and I run it, and it installs it on my PC.

707
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:56,380
Speaker 0: Because you're a moron.

708
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,998
Speaker 0: But in Linux, when I wanted something, I'm just like, "App get install this thing," and I have this repository that just handles it.

709
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,240
Speaker 0: And yet, with the iPad model, it's a very similar thing.

710
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:15,000
Speaker 0: I want an application that does X. I go into the "repository" -- I'm making quote marks -- and I just get it.

711
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:22,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the problem -- the key differences are, number one, that repository, not everything in there is free.

712
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:22,860
Speaker 0: Yep.

713
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,500
Speaker 1: Number two, when you get something from that repository, you can get the source code to it also.

714
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:30,260
Speaker 1: And three, you can just put things in the repository.

715
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:30,535
Speaker 1: Yep.

716
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:31,918
Speaker 1: No matter what it is.

717
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,140
Speaker 0: But then again, there are the quote-unquote "approved" repositories.

718
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,400
Speaker 0: Like, if you just install an Ubuntu or CentOS or something, you get a kind of certified, vetted, you-trust-these-people repository.

719
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they only check to make sure something works.

720
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,240
Speaker 1: They don't check to make sure they like it or not.

721
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:48,340
Speaker 1: And also, you can just add any repository you want.

722
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,760
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but that's the fundamental difference, that the iTunes repository is it.

723
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:57,320
Speaker 0: I can't add the iTunes.ru repository.

724
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:06,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, and the main thing is, you know, the first argument that, like, you know -- I try to argue that these things are bad, and people say, "Ah, they're not bad,

725
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:06,860
Speaker 1: blah.".

726
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:08,220
Speaker 0: We can do this pretty simply.

727
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,400
Speaker 0: You make the argument that it's bad, and I'll make the argument that it's good.

728
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,120
Speaker 0: It's pretty easy to take turns on this.

729
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:29,780
Speaker 1: All right, so the first reason that it's bad, right, is if people, you know, have a computer that is too easy to use, there will be much less incentive for them to learn how to actually use a computer, and basically, there will be this tyranny of the people who are programming over the people who are just using iPads.

730
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:34,310
Speaker 0: Ah, but Scott, do we not have a tyranny of mechanics and a tyranny of civil engineers?

731
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:42,020
Speaker 0: that people only need to know the specialized tools for their specialized jobs, and for every other realm of their life, they really just need an appliance?

732
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,160
Speaker 0: Shouldn't we trust the experts to take care of the expert work?

733
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:52,320
Speaker 1: We do indeed have a tyranny of mechanics, and I wish more people would know how their car works so they wouldn't be getting ripped off and such.

734
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,339
Speaker 1: But here's the problem, right?

735
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,459
Speaker 1: Even more so than the car, the computer is integrated into every part of life.

736
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,540
Speaker 1: You use your car for transportation, which is a major part of life, which is why I think you should know how your car works, even if you're not personally capable of fixing it, right?

737
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,239
Speaker 1: You should at least know more than most people know.

738
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,180
Speaker 1: But a computer is everything.

739
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:24,679
Speaker 1: If you don't know how to handle your computer, basically, as the world progresses to where more and more things are handled by computers, the computers will now own your life, and thus the people who control the computers now control you.

740
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,400
Speaker 1: But at the same time, do you not-- As opposed to just controlling your transportation.

741
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,059
Speaker 0: Even with the car, do you not need a license to drive?

742
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:40,140
Speaker 0: And if someone is incapable of driving safely without harming themselves and others, do we not force them to not drive and have someone else drive them around?

743
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:43,592
Speaker 0: Is the iPad/iPhone model not an expert?

744
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:51,919
Speaker 0: makes the people who can never figure it out drive themselves in this controlled, safe environment on these rails, and the smart people will just use something else?

745
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:53,233
Speaker 1: That is true.

746
00:38:54,621 --> 00:39:01,860
Speaker 1: The people who are incapable of driving, it's basically a car that drives itself for those people who cannot drive themselves.

747
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:06,360
Speaker 1: And now it enables those people to get around, and that is a good thing.

748
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:14,980
Speaker 1: However, think about the harm-- At least, it's not necessarily harm, but opportunity cost of this happening.

749
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:24,600
Speaker 1: And the opportunity cost is, think about how the world has-- We have been able to change the world because of our control over our own computers, right?

750
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:31,040
Speaker 1: The fact that the web exists at all is because people all had computers that they could control.

751
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,620
Speaker 0: Ah, so Scott, so Scott, but this was a tyranny of the ultra-elite technorati.

752
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,360
Speaker 0: The vast majority of people are not contributing to the internet in that regard.

753
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:43,692
Speaker 0: They are contributing information.

754
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,440
Speaker 0: They are contributing on a meta-high level, like they're contributing way above.

755
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:50,631
Speaker 0: They're adding to Facebook.

756
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:51,460
Speaker 0: They're writing content.

757
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,600
Speaker 0: But below the level of putting words and videos into the stream, they are not doing anything.

758
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,373
Speaker 1: You need to think farther into the past.

759
00:39:58,433 --> 00:39:59,320
Speaker 1: Think of this, right?

760
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:04,360
Speaker 1: In the '90s, there was AOL, and AOL was dominating, right?

761
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,038
Speaker 1: And why were we able to escape AOL?

762
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:19,359
Speaker 1: Yes, there were technorati and programmers who were able to make up the Apache web server and to make Netscape Navigator and to make these tools for escaping AOL.

763
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,518
Speaker 1: That made people want to leave AOL.

764
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:29,415
Speaker 1: But it was because people were able to control the software on their own machines that even-- You think, "Oh, everyone's

765
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:29,780
Speaker 1: ignorant.".

766
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,999
Speaker 1: Well, they somehow managed to install Netscape and then get out of AOL.

767
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:38,240
Speaker 1: They managed to do it, no matter how ignorant they were, because they had control over their computers.

768
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,099
Speaker 1: They had this choice.

769
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:45,932
Speaker 1: But at the same time-- And if they had all had iPads or AOL pads in the late '90s, AOL would still be conquering the world today.

770
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:46,920
Speaker 1: There would have been no change.

771
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:57,120
Speaker 0: But then at the same time, will there not simply be a dichotomy between the people who don't understand how any of the technology they use works, who just use the appliance, and the technorati who live in a different internet world?

772
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:58,860
Speaker 1: There will be that dichotomy.

773
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:16,920
Speaker 1: But what I'm saying is that if these people who are ignorant and don't know how their stuff works, if they lose their ability to have choice, then that takes power to change the world away from open-source people like us, because we can't get anything into their hands.

774
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,920
Speaker 1: And the only power to change the world through technology will be in the hands of technology companies with money who can get their software onto these closed platforms.

775
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:30,779
Speaker 0: Ah, but at the same time, despite the openness of the PC platform, people were very resistant to even leaving AOL.

776
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:45,260
Speaker 0: And much of what caused this shift was industries very much pushing and promoting their own agendas to get people away from AOL into an open marketplace where they could then compete, and in the end, they win due to the fact that people still didn't really have any choice.

777
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:54,320
Speaker 1: Well, all companies, right, they seem to follow this model of where when they're falling behind, they push for the open way, because when it's open, then they can compete.

778
00:41:54,681 --> 00:42:01,120
Speaker 1: But then once you're ahead, you want to close it up, because you've got the most people, and then you lock them all into you, right?

779
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,080
Speaker 1: That seems to be the business model that flows back and forth, right?

780
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:16,339
Speaker 1: If you're winning in some department, right, you want that department to be closed, so nobody leaves you because you have the most customers right now, you have the most market share, and if you close it down, all those people have to stick with you.

781
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,100
Speaker 1: If everyone's got iPods, you want to lock that shit down so they can't go switch to Zunes that easily.

782
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,420
Speaker 1: It's very hard to switch to Zune because you're locked in the iTunes library.

783
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:30,560
Speaker 1: But, what do you do if everybody's using Windows, right, that's the majority winner.

784
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:38,880
Speaker 1: You need people to switch to Mac, which means you need to make stuff like Safari, and all this other stuff so that it's, you know, make it as compatible as possible.

785
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,333
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we can open up Microsoft Word documents.

786
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:46,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can do, you know, you want everything opened up so that people can easily transfer over to you.

787
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:55,059
Speaker 1: But you know, one day, OS X is on top of Windows and market share, they're going to close that shit down, and it's going to be much harder to switch back the other direction.

788
00:42:55,361 --> 00:42:58,060
Speaker 0: Let's look at the AOL days versus the current days.

789
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:06,140
Speaker 0: Most people who are using their computers, they recognize that the iPad, at least to them, is just better.

790
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,660
Speaker 0: It just has a much better and more intuitive interface.

791
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:18,420
Speaker 0: And unlike the AOL days, back then, they started to move from AOL when they realized they'd see people outside of AOL doing things that they themselves could not do.

792
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,240
Speaker 1: That is true.

793
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:28,151
Speaker 0: What is there that open source is doing better right now that normal people care about than the iPad and the iPhone?

794
00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:30,600
Speaker 0: Name a phone that is better than the iPhone.

795
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,520
Speaker 1: Right now, there is nothing.

796
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,500
Speaker 0: Name anything related to media that is better than iTunes doing what people want it to do.

797
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,551
Speaker 1: Right now, there is nothing, right?

798
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:42,140
Speaker 1: Not at this very moment.

799
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,926
Speaker 1: And that is the reason why the iPad and the iPhone and such are winning at this very moment because there is no such thing.

800
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:56,860
Speaker 1: However, if they win too much, if they get too far ahead, then the potential for there to be such a thing in the future will disappear.

801
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,980
Speaker 1: In the olden days, that thing was Napster that appeared, that everyone installed.

802
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:12,459
Speaker 1: Now, if you invented Napster today, it could not take foothold because there are not enough... If too many people had these lockdown devices, Napster would never get on those devices.

803
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,180
Speaker 0: The industry has a vested interest in locking these things down to prevent anything like Napster from ever happening again.

804
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:19,635
Speaker 1: That is true.

805
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,059
Speaker 0: In fact, there is probably a great...

806
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,900
Speaker 1: But that is horrible as the worst thing for the world and the progress of human society.

807
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,040
Speaker 0: But it is a good thing for grandma who will never get a virus again.

808
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,745
Speaker 1: It is not good for grandma.

809
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:35,320
Speaker 1: You think it is good for grandma when you are only looking at that one grandma and her personal experience.

810
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:41,900
Speaker 1: But I think the future, the progress of technology in the world as a whole is better for grandma.

811
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,039
Speaker 1: Even though she does not know it.

812
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,960
Speaker 0: Are you saying that it is bad that old grandmas now have easy to use computers?

813
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,880
Speaker 1: I am saying there is more to it than that.

814
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,420
Speaker 1: There is a good part and a bad part to everything.

815
00:44:54,261 --> 00:45:01,980
Speaker 0: Why do we have to choose, Scott, between computers that are easy to use and just work and computers that are impossible to use but are open?

816
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:03,419
Speaker 1: We do not have to choose.

817
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:06,120
Speaker 1: I have a very simple solution to this problem.

818
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,616
Speaker 1: Oh, do you?

819
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,298
Speaker 1: Yes.

820
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,279
Speaker 1: Solution number one.

821
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,680
Speaker 1: Somebody needs to hire a good designer that is not going to work at Apple.

822
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:23,060
Speaker 0: Can you honestly argue to me that Google, which has effectively infinite resources, is unable to do so?

823
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,820
Speaker 1: They have hired tons of designers and apparently they are all sucking if you have not looked at Google shit lately.

824
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:30,300
Speaker 0: So are there good designers?

825
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,820
Speaker 1: That is a problem.

826
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:33,900
Speaker 1: Get to design school kids.

827
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,380
Speaker 1: Stop going to work at magazines and fashion and work on industrial design.

828
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:39,560
Speaker 0: But how come it has not happened?

829
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,520
Speaker 0: How come there is no one?

830
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:41,438
Speaker 1: I do not know.

831
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,100
Speaker 1: It is frightening.

832
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,099
Speaker 0: And of course, open source.

833
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:46,120
Speaker 0: X windows is fantastic.

834
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,000
Speaker 1: Actually, X windows is going out the door but it is another episode.

835
00:45:50,805 --> 00:45:51,760
Speaker 1: I have an argument actually.

836
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,420
Speaker 0: I am going to make a separate argument.

837
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,360
Speaker 1: Here is a second part of the solution.

838
00:45:57,241 --> 00:46:02,940
Speaker 1: We just need to make a law that says, look, if you buy it, you own it, you can do whatever you want to it.

839
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,520
Speaker 1: You have to include -- you cannot completely lock it down.

840
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,180
Speaker 1: Grandma would get the iPad, she would not know the difference.

841
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:17,560
Speaker 1: But if I get an iPad, there has got to be an option somewhere for me to -- remember in the olden days, you would buy stereo and it would come with a schematic?

842
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,280
Speaker 1: You just need to put that in law so that a computer comes with a nerd document with it.

843
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,220
Speaker 1: Your car has to come with a service manual.

844
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,920
Speaker 0: In the modern world, cars do not come with a service manual.

845
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,779
Speaker 1: I know, it is bullshit.

846
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:29,880
Speaker 1: I buy the car, you should give me the fucking layout.

847
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:33,580
Speaker 0: The only realms -- and this is where I think we are going with the PC.

848
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,599
Speaker 0: I was playing the devil's advocate the whole way.

849
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,132
Speaker 0: I point out, Scott, that it was increasingly difficult to make an argument that did not boil down to.

850
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:45,180
Speaker 0: I am evil and have the power to do what I want so you are fucked anyway.

851
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:52,020
Speaker 1: If you have a car, you worry, if I give up the service manual, some other company can make the same car.

852
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,970
Speaker 1: They can just take apart your car.

853
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,596
Speaker 1: There are no secrets in the car.

854
00:46:56,636 --> 00:46:57,820
Speaker 1: There are no secrets in anything.

855
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,420
Speaker 0: But no, Scott, you are not letting me finish.

856
00:47:00,282 --> 00:47:06,140
Speaker 0: The PC is going to move into a realm, the actual physical PC that many other things have moved into.

857
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,560
Speaker 0: When I buy a Radio Shack whatever, like a Radio Shack microphone or something, it is just a shitty microphone that just works.

858
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:23,540
Speaker 0: If I buy a real compressor or a real mixer or a real microphone, it comes with a schematic, it comes with diagrams, full technical documentation, a warranty, and support.

859
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:28,800
Speaker 0: If I buy a regular car, just some Ford car or whatever, I do not get the real service manual.

860
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,720
Speaker 0: And I have to go to the dealer and all that stuff.

861
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,900
Speaker 1: I am sure if you buy a Ferrari, you get the real deal.

862
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:39,720
Speaker 0: The PC is going the way of every other thing that has ever come out in the history of the world.

863
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:49,680
Speaker 0: If you are a professional or a contractor or an expert, you will get the hardware that gives you the freedom, openness, and documentation that you need.

864
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,586
Speaker 0: The future is going to be computer.

865
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:55,740
Speaker 0: experts will have actual PCs that they run whatever the hell they want on.

866
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,260
Speaker 0: And everybody else is going to be using an appliance.

867
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,640
Speaker 1: But those people with PCs because computers have infiltrated every part of our society?

868
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,019
Speaker 0: Yes, we are going to be mechanic wizards.

869
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,160
Speaker 1: And the thing is, but we are benevolent.

870
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,233
Speaker 1: I am saying, "Look, you people, I do not want to rule you like an evil god.

871
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:11,557
Speaker 1: Do not let me.

872
00:48:11,698 --> 00:48:12,079
Speaker 1: Learn to use a

873
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:12,340
Speaker 1: computer.".

874
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,498
Speaker 0: Scott, and they will look up at you and say, "Do you have

875
00:48:14,538 --> 00:48:14,760
Speaker 0: circuses?".

876
00:48:15,741 --> 00:48:18,737
Speaker 1: And I will say, "Yes, watch all these video games I can play that you

877
00:48:18,777 --> 00:48:19,099
Speaker 1: can't.".

878
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:22,119
Speaker 0: And they will say, "Those video games are difficult and I do not want to play

879
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:22,260
Speaker 0: them.".

880
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,600
Speaker 0: I will continue playing Farm-Iville-Pad-Frontier-Town.

881
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,817
Speaker 1: And I will say, "No, people are stupid and I could not save

882
00:48:28,857 --> 00:48:29,118
Speaker 1: them.".

883
00:48:29,581 --> 00:48:31,356
Speaker 0: And they will say, "Look ye mighty upon my

884
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:31,699
Speaker 0: farm.".

885
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,440
Speaker 1: I will say, "Look ye mighty...".

886
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,800
Speaker 1: See, what would really... Upon my penis.

887
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,740
Speaker 0: The only way to fix this is we have to hack into Zynga's servers, right?

888
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:42,500
Speaker 0: And corrupt Farmville.

889
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,179
Speaker 1: Farmville teaches you to... Teaches you to see?

890
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,396
Speaker 0: Teaches you to be like, "Look, Farmville broke because of

891
00:48:48,456 --> 00:48:49,039
Speaker 0: DRM.".

892
00:48:49,401 --> 00:48:51,240
Speaker 0: Just lie, straight up.

893
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,576
Speaker 1: Whatever.

894
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,195
Speaker 1: I do not know.

895
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:00,437
Speaker 0: But really, I think the future of the PC is that the majority of people, like it or not, are not going to have PCs in the next 20 years.

896
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,379
Speaker 0: They will have phones, tablets, screens, devices that...

897
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:06,919
Speaker 1: TVs with computers built into them.

898
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,540
Speaker 0: And they will have data in the cloud and they will use this in their day-to-day lives.

899
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,820
Speaker 0: The only people who will need processing power and stuff are the experts.

900
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,456
Speaker 1: I mean, look at me.

901
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,540
Speaker 1: If I didn't... I could even see people...

902
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,060
Speaker 0: If I didn't play games and I didn't do podcasts and video, I would not need a desktop PC.

903
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:33,780
Speaker 1: The thing is, I even see... Right now, we're looking mostly at multimedia people, media creators, and programmers, right?

904
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,820
Speaker 1: I could even see the multimedia creators being shut out to where there's some sort of... Right?

905
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:47,420
Speaker 1: But then, instead of the iMac or the Mac Pro, it'll just be the art machine.

906
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,159
Speaker 1: And all it does is run the art programs and that's it.

907
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,480
Speaker 1: And it doesn't do anything else.

908
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,920
Speaker 1: And all the art people will buy it.

909
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,780
Speaker 1: It has a Wacom built into it or whatever.

910
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:02,975
Speaker 0: Now, that's a dangerous future for me because way back in the Napster days, and many of the people who actually understood what was going on... I remember people were saying, "Yeah,

911
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:03,420
Speaker 0: Napster.".

912
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,839
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Napster?

913
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,200
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

914
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,665
Speaker 0: Just go to MP3

915
00:50:06,726 --> 00:50:06,848
Speaker 0: sites."

916
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:08,157
Speaker 0: Sites.

917
00:50:08,683 --> 00:50:11,017
Speaker 0: And then, that night, I was like, "Oh, what's

918
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:11,380
Speaker 0: Napster?".

919
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,298
Speaker 0: And actually, once I realized what it was...

920
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:13,826
Speaker 1: I was like, "Oh,

921
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:14,295
Speaker 1: shit.".

922
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:24,719
Speaker 0: I realized that the danger is not that we will event... The law will come down on people who violate intellectual property and they'll stop people who pirate stuff.

923
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,600
Speaker 0: Piracy is not the danger to all the people out there who want control.

924
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,159
Speaker 0: Piracy is just awesome.

925
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:37,258
Speaker 0: The danger to them is that people who have control over their own hardware can make their own stuff.

926
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:46,700
Speaker 0: That they can make their own movie and distribute it, and nobody can stop them, and nobody can compete with them, and there's no barrier to entry anymore to anything.

927
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,320
Speaker 0: And the lockdown world is going to try to prevent that.

928
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, because not only...

929
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:52,818
Speaker 0: Look at iTunes.

930
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,180
Speaker 0: People like to use iTunes to get geek nights.

931
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:01,220
Speaker 0: Even iTunes dropped all of our individual episode feeds, and they only kept our main feed.

932
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:02,839
Speaker 0: We have no way to contest that.

933
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,919
Speaker 0: We have no control over that.

934
00:51:04,212 --> 00:51:04,340
Speaker 1: Nope.

935
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:10,039
Speaker 0: You have to go side routes to say, "I want to use this URL for a particular RSS

936
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:10,300
Speaker 0: feed.".

937
00:51:10,602 --> 00:51:11,654
Speaker 0: They basically said, "Fuck you

938
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:11,998
Speaker 0: guys.".

939
00:51:12,326 --> 00:51:12,518
Speaker 1: Yep.

940
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,620
Speaker 0: That's dangerous, I think, to the future of media distribution.

941
00:51:15,882 --> 00:51:16,660
Speaker 1: It's very dangerous.

942
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:25,620
Speaker 1: What's even more dangerous is that when you have a closed platform, the tools of production are also controlled, right?

943
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:30,220
Speaker 0: Well, they're controlled now by the fact that Adobe sucks.

944
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:31,620
Speaker 1: It's like, "Look, you got an iPad.

945
00:51:31,741 --> 00:51:34,680
Speaker 1: Well, look, you can take photos and you can draw doodles and you can write.

946
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,786
Speaker 1: It's like you can create these

947
00:51:35,806 --> 00:51:35,987
Speaker 1: things.".

948
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,920
Speaker 1: But really, you don't have the full tools of production, right?

949
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,340
Speaker 1: That's why people always... There's this old argument that why you can't have freedom if you have communism, right?

950
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,672
Speaker 1: It's like, "I want to go and

951
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:48,257
Speaker 1: protest.".

952
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:50,000
Speaker 1: "All right, we'll let you protest.

953
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:50,265
Speaker 1: Go

954
00:51:50,326 --> 00:51:50,552
Speaker 1: ahead.".

955
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,013
Speaker 1: "All right, let's go make some

956
00:51:52,073 --> 00:51:52,538
Speaker 1: signs.".

957
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,038
Speaker 1: "All right, we got to go to paper to make all the

958
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:55,320
Speaker 1: signs.".

959
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,792
Speaker 1: "All right, let's go to the paper

960
00:51:56,832 --> 00:51:57,276
Speaker 1: factory.".

961
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,380
Speaker 1: The state-run paper factory, right?

962
00:52:01,762 --> 00:52:11,120
Speaker 1: "All right, I want to complain and I'm going to make a piece of software that's going to put Apple out of business using my Apple computer with Apple tools because it's the only computer.

963
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,760
Speaker 1: Shit, I can't make this thing on this Apple device because it's not possible.

964
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,018
Speaker 1: They would not make a tool that allowed me to put them out of business with their own

965
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:19,320
Speaker 1: tool.".

966
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,260
Speaker 0: We also have the argument that's much more tricky.

967
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:32,481
Speaker 0: Like with video games, I learned most of what I know about computers today because when I was a kid, I wanted to play computer games and that was goddamn impossible and I had to learn

968
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:33,404
Speaker 1: IRQs

969
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:46,400
Speaker 0: and DMAs and I would go into DOS and load drivers and futz with stuff and boot disks and that taught me like I'm a better person and a better gamer because of that and I'm a computer professional.

970
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:54,000
Speaker 0: I make boatloads of money, but at the same time, I could never justify going back to that shitty old medieval world of computing.

971
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,126
Speaker 1: No, but I think the thing is.

972
00:52:56,568 --> 00:53:08,440
Speaker 1: I think that it is necessary for people to learn and that is the way that I learn, but I think there needs to be a way for new people to learn and perhaps intentionally suffering by choice or simulated suffering or something.

973
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:08,902
Speaker 1: Well, what

974
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:22,180
Speaker 0: I always say, and I think we've talked about this on Geek Nights, I don't want to get into a lot of detail, is that what we need is one, computer science and coding should be as important as math and reading and social studies in all levels of primary education.

975
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,200
Speaker 1: K through 12, fifth subject, every day, you know, every day you have math class.

976
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:26,820
Speaker 1: Kids should just learn C++.

977
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,077
Speaker 0: They should learn object-oriented programming alongside algebra.

978
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,540
Speaker 1: No, they should learn starting at the bottom.

979
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,319
Speaker 1: You should learn how a computer works.

980
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,640
Speaker 1: Then you got to learn how to program a computer.

981
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,660
Speaker 1: You know, you got to learn every possible level.

982
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,058
Speaker 1: You should know everything there is to know.

983
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:47,860
Speaker 1: K through 12, if you're going to computer class every day, you can learn everything from, you know, the electron on up to the C code.

984
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,459
Speaker 0: People don't necessarily, you know, there are people who are not good at math, but you know what, they still have to take math in high school and maybe they get C's.

985
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,620
Speaker 1: And they're not going to be mathematicians.

986
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,720
Speaker 0: And they don't take calculus.

987
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,879
Speaker 1: And they're just going to be a writer and they're never going to use math except to pay their bills.

988
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,520
Speaker 0: But at least they got as high in math as they were willing and capable of getting.

989
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:04,158
Speaker 1: That's right.

990
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,700
Speaker 0: But we don't give any kid the opportunity to do that in technology.

991
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:09,020
Speaker 0: The only people who learn technology.

992
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,280
Speaker 1: They can't even afford to pay teachers.

993
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,020
Speaker 1: How are they going to pay us to be teachers?

994
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,900
Speaker 1: The only people in this modern world.

995
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,560
Speaker 1: Our salary, they had to pay us as much as three teachers.

996
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:22,459
Speaker 0: Scott, do you agree that the only people who learn technology to any degree in the modern world are the people who are self-motivated and do it on their own?

997
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it's also people who have some external motivation.

998
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:31,819
Speaker 1: For example, you know, I care mostly about gaming, but I have to learn technology to do the gaming, so I do it.

999
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,620
Speaker 1: But as if computers get too easy, then that motivator goes away.

1000
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:37,640
Speaker 1: I want to do art.

1001
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,820
Speaker 1: I don't have to learn computers to do art because it's so easy.

1002
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,128
Speaker 1: Ta-da!

1003
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:47,060
Speaker 1: Now that person who would have learned computers and become a great person at computers 10, 20 years ago will not any longer.

1004
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:55,980
Speaker 1: So the, you know, the number of people who have the possibility to, you know, control and manipulate technology is going to have a decreasing return as time goes on.

1005
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,080
Speaker 0: Well, I think for one, the future is, just as I- It's already decreased pretty heavily.

1006
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,220
Speaker 0: Just as I described, PCs are going to be an expert tool, much like an audio compressor is.

1007
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:04,460
Speaker 0: Right.

1008
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,792
Speaker 1: So at CES, there was this one news which brought this episode on.

1009
00:55:07,812 --> 00:55:10,856
Speaker 1: that makes the situation more dire, right?

1010
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,380
Speaker 1: And ooh, dire.

1011
00:55:12,761 --> 00:55:12,928
Speaker 1: Ooh.

1012
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,177
Speaker 1: Dire bear.

1013
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:15,180
Speaker 1: Gar.

1014
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:16,135
Speaker 1: Okay, so.

1015
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:25,199
Speaker 1: Basically what the new- the biggest news at CES, I think, right, was that they announced that Windows 8 will run on an ARM CPU, right?

1016
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:32,758
Speaker 1: I don't know how much technical detail I want to explain about this right now, but there is a big difference, you know, Intel CPUs are all x86.

1017
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,118
Speaker 1: So are the AMDs.

1018
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,220
Speaker 1: That's the CPU architecture.

1019
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,800
Speaker 1: Didn't we do a CPU architecture episode?

1020
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:37,377
Speaker 0: I think so.

1021
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,299
Speaker 1: Go listen to that episode.

1022
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:46,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, ARM CPUs, right, follow a completely different business model than the Intel x86 CPUs, right?

1023
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:51,719
Speaker 1: You know, obviously the architecture of ARM, it's a better instruction set, it's all these other things, right?

1024
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:55,500
Speaker 1: But here's the most important thing that matters to this discussion.

1025
00:55:56,121 --> 00:56:16,220
Speaker 1: The way Intel's business model works is that they pack in the transistors as tight as they can with the maximum density Moore's law, and they crank out the exact same CPU as much as they possibly can in high quantity, and they keep making it more and more powerful, and they charge a lot of money for the CPU itself, right?

1026
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,940
Speaker 1: But all that CPU does is CPU.

1027
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,438
Speaker 1: It doesn't really do anything else.

1028
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,800
Speaker 1: So you build, when you make systems using these CPUs, you build everything around them.

1029
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,900
Speaker 1: That's why you have a sound card.

1030
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,100
Speaker 1: That's why you have a video card, right?

1031
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,139
Speaker 1: Because it's not in there.

1032
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,480
Speaker 1: I mean, some of them have video cards in them now, but it's not a good video.

1033
00:56:32,843 --> 00:56:33,919
Speaker 1: I'm not going to get into it, right?

1034
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:35,640
Speaker 1: But that's the Intel business model.

1035
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,700
Speaker 1: The ARM business model is completely different.

1036
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,080
Speaker 1: They make what is called the system on a chip, right?

1037
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,880
Speaker 1: If you're making a device, let's say me and Rem decide we want to make a tablet.

1038
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,180
Speaker 1: Okay, Rem, we're going to make a tablet tomorrow.

1039
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,500
Speaker 1: What do we want this tablet to have?

1040
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,220
Speaker 1: We want it to have a 12-inch touch screen.

1041
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,613
Speaker 1: We want it to be able to play MP3s.

1042
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:54,520
Speaker 1: We want it to be able to have some wireless networking.

1043
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,940
Speaker 1: We don't need any wired networking, and we're going to have a USB port, but we're not going to have any firewall, right?

1044
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,608
Speaker 1: We make the list of all the things we're going to have, and then you go out, and you get someone to make you an ARM CPU.

1045
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,800
Speaker 1: that has just those things and no other things.

1046
00:57:10,341 --> 00:57:11,540
Speaker 1: It's not about Moore's law.

1047
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:19,240
Speaker 1: They can pack in so many transistors that they've got plenty of space, so they don't even pack it in as tight as they could to make it as fast as they could.

1048
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,319
Speaker 0: So here's the TL;DR of that.

1049
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:24,920
Speaker 1: They just make the custom system for that one device into that.

1050
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:32,299
Speaker 0: The TL;DR of that is that it takes the power out of the programmers who have... I mean, it doesn't take resources to write code.

1051
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:37,860
Speaker 0: It takes resources to make a chip to figure out a proprietary chip to do something on it.

1052
00:57:38,102 --> 00:57:40,000
Speaker 1: An ARM chip isn't proprietary.

1053
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:41,920
Speaker 1: Linux runs on ARM.

1054
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:45,960
Speaker 0: But a phone device has the particular limitations of what that phone can do.

1055
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:47,940
Speaker 1: That is the problem, right?

1056
00:57:48,462 --> 00:57:51,360
Speaker 1: With an Intel CPU, all it does is CPU.

1057
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:52,597
Speaker 1: That's it.

1058
00:57:53,080 --> 00:58:01,620
Speaker 1: So you put it in this motherboard, and you can add features, and you can do anything that is possible with computer technology by adding onto it.

1059
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:18,360
Speaker 1: When you have the system-on-a-chip model, where this CPU, although it is ARM, and although you can program it easily enough, it is still unique to this one piece of hardware, or this line of hardware, and it only has these limited features.

1060
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,000
Speaker 1: You really can't add to it that easily.

1061
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:22,360
Speaker 1: The system is on the chip.

1062
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,239
Speaker 1: It's not a system around the chip.

1063
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,280
Speaker 1: So you can't be going like, "Oh shit, this thing doesn't play.

1064
00:58:28,002 --> 00:58:30,438
Speaker 1: It's got an MP3 decoder in it, and that's how it plays

1065
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:30,620
Speaker 1: MP3s.".

1066
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:38,020
Speaker 1: So I can't suddenly, if I try to make it play a different codec, I'll have to do that with the CPU.

1067
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,899
Speaker 1: It doesn't have a hardware decoder, and it's not powerful enough that it drains the battery life, and that's that.

1068
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:54,279
Speaker 1: So when you have a PC, even if it's not Intel x86 architecture, but your ability to do new things is limitless.

1069
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,860
Speaker 1: When you have a system-on-a-chip, you are far more constrained just with the hardware.

1070
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:01,920
Speaker 1: Even if it was open, you could put any code on there you wanted.

1071
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,019
Speaker 1: You really couldn't do everything that you could think of, because you can't go adding stuff to it.

1072
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,597
Speaker 1: You can't go, "Oh man, I should do

1073
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:09,839
Speaker 1: this.".

1074
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:12,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing on the chip to help you with that.

1075
00:59:15,342 --> 00:59:23,820
Speaker 0: So I think this is just part of the divergence between the expert system, the tool of the master, and the generic commodity appliance.

1076
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:28,258
Speaker 1: And the thing is, I think that what you're going to see, you see Windows 8 is going to be on ARM.

1077
00:59:30,063 --> 00:59:32,500
Speaker 1: ARM is already number one, whether you realize it or not.

1078
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:38,960
Speaker 1: It's going to become even more number one, and Intel and AMD are going to be hurting big, big time in the next year.

1079
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:46,258
Speaker 1: Huge hurting, because the benefits of ARM, you'll see every DS has an ARM, by the way, two arms.

1080
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,679
Speaker 0: Well, what's really going to end this?

1081
00:59:47,740 --> 01:00:00,700
Speaker 1: The main benefit is that you have incredible battery life, all these things that matter to the end user when they're on a closed system, just everything is better as far as they can tell.

1082
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:10,880
Speaker 0: What's really going to end this, the big next step will be, because right now, one driver, it's a surprisingly large industry in terms of money, even though it's a relatively small segment of the population.

1083
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:31,860
Speaker 0: PC gamers are going to eventually converge on Xbox between the two, and once all the things that PC, either PC gamers disappear, or the things that PC gamers like to do are done on more specialized hardware away from the generic PC, that's one of the last nails in the PC coffin for anyone who isn't a super computer expert.

1084
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, it's kind of a murky gray area.

1085
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,839
Speaker 1: It's like, well, are they going to make Xbox things run on the PC?

1086
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,720
Speaker 1: Are they going to make on Xbox PC?

1087
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,820
Speaker 0: I don't think Microsoft has decided what direction they're going.

1088
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,020
Speaker 1: It's like, that's what Microsoft used to be pushing for.

1089
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:49,460
Speaker 0: They were pushing forever for commodity hardware, and then you just run games on whichever console.

1090
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:50,780
Speaker 1: A lot of people have tried that.

1091
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,960
Speaker 1: Atari, well, I don't know if Atari did it on purpose.

1092
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:01,560
Speaker 1: But 3DO was like, anyone who wants to can make a 3DO, and you just have to pay us money, and then people who make 3DO games did not work, did not work well at all.

1093
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,660
Speaker 1: But Microsoft wanted that.

1094
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:09,100
Speaker 1: They wanted to be like, all right, look, let's make a common gaming platform that anyone can make games for, and let it be one.

1095
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:09,920
Speaker 0: That is the future.

1096
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,559
Speaker 0: It's just, they tried to do it, at least they tried to push for it too soon.

1097
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I can see them now coming out with the Xbox PC.

1098
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,940
Speaker 0: The Xbox is basically just a Windows PC, kind of specialized.

1099
01:01:22,063 --> 01:01:22,186
Speaker 0: Yep.

1100
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,992
Speaker 1: It could be scary if you want to play computer games.

1101
01:01:27,072 --> 01:01:29,130
Speaker 1: and basically, what's Steam going to do?

1102
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:35,020
Speaker 1: If Windows 8 is basically just an Xbox on your desk.

1103
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:35,699
Speaker 0: It depends.

1104
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:44,021
Speaker 0: Were I Steam, I would be talking to Microsoft and keeping negotiation channels open 24/7.

1105
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:46,920
Speaker 1: If I were Microsoft, I would buy Valve.

1106
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:48,620
Speaker 0: Oh, in a heartbeat.

1107
01:01:48,841 --> 01:01:52,580
Speaker 1: And then I would mix it all together, and then I would be the king.

1108
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,400
Speaker 0: I would sell the gaming box.

1109
01:01:55,021 --> 01:02:02,980
Speaker 1: I would merge the Steam and Xbox networks together, and then because I was the king, I wouldn't need to charge for Xbox Live Gold.

1110
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,220
Speaker 1: I'd just give everyone the free gold.

1111
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,280
Speaker 0: That would basically shut PlayStation out, because then what would happen- PlayStation isn't shut out already?

1112
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:09,700
Speaker 0: They're still there.

1113
01:02:10,282 --> 01:02:13,140
Speaker 0: I think the PlayStation line would die if that happened.

1114
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,560
Speaker 0: I think Nintendo would continue on, but Nintendo is basically making the gaming appliance.

1115
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:24,013
Speaker 1: I'm wary about Nintendo, because there's news that the 3DS is going to have five hours of battery life.

1116
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,934
Speaker 1: Because it's basically running three screens, because you need two screens for the top, which is 3D.

1117
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:29,375
Speaker 0: Yep.

1118
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:30,580
Speaker 1: It's going to be rough.

1119
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,180
Speaker 0: At the same time, their demographic has shifted quite a bit in the last few years.

1120
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:35,840
Speaker 1: I'm also worried.

1121
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,280
Speaker 1: It comes with a charging dock.

1122
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:37,800
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1123
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,240
Speaker 1: Do you have to hold the dock if you want to play it while charging?

1124
01:02:40,643 --> 01:02:41,018
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1125
01:02:41,321 --> 01:02:41,860
Speaker 0: I'm holding off.

1126
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:44,860
Speaker 0: I'm basically not a Nintendo gamer anymore.

1127
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:45,327
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1128
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:46,235
Speaker 1: We'll see.

1129
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:48,660
Speaker 0: But that's a whole separate discussion.

1130
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:50,779
Speaker 1: Oh, and if you're still thinking, "Oh, no.

1131
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:51,774
Speaker 1: ARM's not going to take

1132
01:02:51,876 --> 01:02:52,019
Speaker 1: over."

1133
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:52,419
Speaker 1: Well, look.

1134
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:57,700
Speaker 1: Apple switched to Intel, but now they're switching to making their own CPUs.

1135
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,500
Speaker 0: Well, look at the laptop market.

1136
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,700
Speaker 0: How much the laptop market changed when the netbook appeared.

1137
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,640
Speaker 0: Most people said, "I just need to get on the internet.

1138
01:03:06,644 --> 01:03:07,814
Speaker 0: I need the cheapest possible

1139
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:08,218
Speaker 0: computer.".

1140
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:15,858
Speaker 0: And now the netbook market is being destroyed by tablets and phones, because people realize they don't even need to type that much.

1141
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,354
Speaker 1: Chrome OS is interesting.

1142
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,839
Speaker 1: I got one of those Chrome laptops, but it's- It's not there.

1143
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:23,747
Speaker 1: Well, it is.

1144
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,880
Speaker 1: It's that managed experience.

1145
01:03:26,244 --> 01:03:26,554
Speaker 1: Here you go.

1146
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,700
Speaker 1: It's a browser, but it's open.

1147
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Speaker 1: You can do anything as long as it's in the browser.

1148
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,320
Speaker 1: And anyone can write a Chrome extension.

1149
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,760
Speaker 1: You just can't write a Chrome extension on a Chrome laptop.

1150
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:38,140
Speaker 1: You need a different one, unless there's something I don't know about.

1151
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,740
Speaker 1: Maybe some sort of in-browser coder text editor program.

1152
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:42,273
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1153
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:47,000
Speaker 1: I guess you can find an in-browser SSH client to another machine somewhere.

1154
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:54,578
Speaker 1: But basically, it's a web browser, so it's as easy to use as Chrome, because it's just Chrome.

1155
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:57,120
Speaker 1: You log in with your Google account.

1156
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,560
Speaker 1: All your data is stored safely, no matter what, in the clouds.

1157
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:06,220
Speaker 1: It's not a thin client you're processing locally that actually has storage locally.

1158
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:18,381
Speaker 1: It explodes, you can pick up another one just like it, and it'll look like exactly where you left off, 100%.

1159
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:28,737
Speaker 1: It's completely secure, and it's actually architected software-wise, basically perfectly, in terms of being safe and secure, and not going to crash, and booting quickly, and all these things.

1160
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,060
Speaker 1: But that's all it does, is browse the web.

1161
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not going to be editing my video on it.

1162
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:39,000
Speaker 1: You can't install Napster on it unless you can get, as in a Chrome extension, Napster.

1163
01:04:40,302 --> 01:04:44,980
Speaker 1: Even if you could, you'd get some music onto it, and then it doesn't have much space.

1164
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:52,040
Speaker 1: You have to store all your music on Google servers, and then if you want to listen to your music, you have to stream it down to listen.

1165
01:04:53,541 --> 01:05:01,000
Speaker 1: It can only do a codec if Chrome has the decoder, or you can get a... I don't know, I haven't found a way to install plugins.

1166
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:06,279
Speaker 1: You can install Chrome extensions, and it comes with a Flash plugin already, but I can't find a way to add more plugins.

1167
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:12,400
Speaker 1: You couldn't add more codecs unless you could add more plugins, or you could find a way to get that in extension.

1168
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,780
Speaker 0: I think because we've gone on long enough, the short version of all this, is the PC dying?

1169
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:17,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of.

1170
01:05:18,601 --> 01:05:21,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's not so good in some ways.

1171
01:05:21,981 --> 01:05:25,620
Speaker 1: A lot of people might, in their small, narrow view, think it's great.

1172
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:26,716
Speaker 1: "Oh, these appliance PCs.

1173
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:27,860
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so great.

1174
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,410
Speaker 1: Everyone can use

1175
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:28,838
Speaker 1: computers.".

1176
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:34,240
Speaker 1: But in the wide world view, it may bring... there are some dystopian possibilities.

1177
01:05:34,521 --> 01:05:37,040
Speaker 0: Or it will make people like us God Kings.

1178
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:37,838
Speaker 1: That's dystopian!

1179
01:05:45,393 --> 01:05:47,530
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1180
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:52,650
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1182
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:01,010
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1183
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:05,730
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1186
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:16,690
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1187
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:44,150
Speaker 0: Well, Scott, because phallic is a cylinder, anything vaguely cylindrical is a phallic.

1188
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,250
Speaker 1: Exactly my point.

1189
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:48,819
Speaker 0: There are holes everywhere.

1190
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,271
Speaker 1: Where are there holes?

1191
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:55,279
Speaker 1: I don't see any holes.

1192
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:05,960
Speaker 1: It's a rectangle.

1193
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,440
Speaker 0: In fact, Scott, your computer has more vaginas than penises.

1194
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,511
Speaker 0: Look at all those vaginas.

1195
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:21,000
Speaker 1: If you find me a vagina that's a rectangle with sharp edges, I don't want to go near that vagina.
