1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,158
Speaker 1: It's Monday, March 13th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:09,460
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:12,806
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,495
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:18,448
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about e-waste and old tech and what to do about it.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,568
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,350
Speaker 1: So yeah, there wasn't Geek Nights last week because I was in London for work doing a bunch of stuff.

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:26,989
Speaker 0: Going to London.

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:35,648
Speaker 1: It's, uh, I do post that Snatch GIF in the internal chat every time I have to go to London.

10
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:36,390
Speaker 1: It's kind of a thing.

11
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:39,850
Speaker 0: I mean, if I went to London, I would post it also.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:47,630
Speaker 1: And every time, nobody has any idea what it's referencing and I have to explain it over and over again.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,699
Speaker 1: Nobody's seen Snatch.

14
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:49,850
Speaker 1: Nobody knows that movie.

15
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:52,966
Speaker 1: I don't know how, but that's how it is.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,703
Speaker 1: But it's an interesting time in London.

17
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:56,910
Speaker 1: I went to a conference.

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,518
Speaker 1: The con was as big as pre-COVID times.

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,129
Speaker 1: It was just completely packed and business as usual in London.

20
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,310
Speaker 0: Compared to New York.

21
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,557
Speaker 1: So far I seem good.

22
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,410
Speaker 1: I seem fine despite spending a week.

23
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,669
Speaker 0: I'm feeling a little like I want to go outside because I see the number is in the hundreds instead of the thousands it's been in.

24
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,510
Speaker 1: For a couple of months we've been doing indoor dining, but we avoid places that are crowded.

25
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:26,245
Speaker 0: But I feel like I could just go wherever now.

26
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:36,350
Speaker 1: I went to a multi-thousand person conference and literally zero people masked at this thing at any point.

27
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:43,089
Speaker 1: I gave some talks and so far I seem fine and we have no word of anyone getting COVID from it.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,930
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

29
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,440
Speaker 0: It's clearly far from eliminated.

30
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,930
Speaker 0: There's immunocompromised people out there.

31
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,430
Speaker 0: There's just one more thing for them to worry about in addition to all the other things.

32
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,090
Speaker 1: Indoor dining you can't wear a mask because you're taking it off to eat.

33
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:07,410
Speaker 1: But I do still wear my mask specifically when I'm on public transport or when I'm in the public areas of an airport.

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,530
Speaker 1: Because the airport feels like there's so many people from so many places the odds are just higher.

35
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,030
Speaker 1: And on the subway the air is actually really shitty down there anyway.

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,530
Speaker 1: So wearing an N95 on the New York subway is probably good for you even if you're not worried about COVID.

37
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,950
Speaker 0: It's not like it doesn't cost you anything to wear.

38
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,390
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm talking to strangers on the subway anyway.

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,570
Speaker 1: If anything it makes me feel more likely not to talk to me though.

40
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,410
Speaker 0: I've been wearing it outside just because it keeps my face warm when it's cold.

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,870
Speaker 1: I actually never wore them outside unless I was in a dense crowd at any point.

42
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,449
Speaker 0: Sometimes my face is cold.

43
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:42,880
Speaker 1: I got a beard.

44
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,689
Speaker 1: My face never gets cold.

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,970
Speaker 0: My face is cold.

46
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,330
Speaker 1: You have the cold sensitivity of a 90 year old and you've had that for as long as I've known you.

47
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,249
Speaker 1: And that has not changed.

48
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:53,630
Speaker 0: It's cold.

49
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,760
Speaker 1: So yeah there's a bunch of news.

50
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,147
Speaker 1: We're not doing a tech news roundup.

51
00:02:59,247 --> 00:02:59,870
Speaker 1: Sorry listener.

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,430
Speaker 1: If you have any complaints about the low frequency of our tech news roundups.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,950
Speaker 1: Well Scott is the dire taskmaster who says I can only do one a year.

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,068
Speaker 1: So take it up with him.

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,930
Speaker 0: You did two in 2021 which means you took a low nap in 2022.

56
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,670
Speaker 1: That's not the fault of me doing the tech news roundup.

57
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,610
Speaker 1: That is the fault of you the regulator failing to enforce our policies.

58
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,630
Speaker 0: If anything I might not be your fault that you didn't come into work that day.

59
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,268
Speaker 0: But I'm still going to charge you a PTO.

60
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,669
Speaker 0: So you accrued.

61
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,330
Speaker 0: It's been a year since 2022.

62
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,409
Speaker 0: So there is now one roundup accrued.

63
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,406
Speaker 1: We'll do a tech news roundup in April.

64
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:36,890
Speaker 1: It's coming.

65
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,059
Speaker 0: You can just accrue if you just wait until 20, 30 something.

66
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,550
Speaker 0: You'll be able to do a roundup the whole year long if you accrue enough roundups.

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,243
Speaker 1: Is Twit even still podcasting?

68
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:52,950
Speaker 1: Did we outlast them?

69
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:53,577
Speaker 0: I think it is.

70
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:54,509
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know.

71
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:55,074
Speaker 1: Let's see.

72
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:55,969
Speaker 1: I'm going to look it up right now.

73
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,220
Speaker 1: Tech podcast from people you trust.

74
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,065
Speaker 1: This Week in Tech.

75
00:03:59,146 --> 00:03:59,387
Speaker 1: Twit.tv.

76
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,210
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's still around, right?

77
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,190
Speaker 1: What if it even has the same people on it?

78
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,331
Speaker 0: Yeah.

79
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,625
Speaker 0: Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.

80
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:05,150
Speaker 0: It's still going.

81
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:09,531
Speaker 1: They started April 17, 2005.

82
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,270
Speaker 1: And they're still going at their same rate.

83
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,890
Speaker 1: They only started a couple months before we went public.

84
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,149
Speaker 1: And actually they went public after we started doing Geek Nights.

85
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:19,658
Speaker 0: Anyway.

86
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:21,249
Speaker 1: Anyway.

87
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,410
Speaker 1: So a little news before we get into the news.

88
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:29,770
Speaker 1: In New York City, as you know, we have one of the oldest subway networks on Earth.

89
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,770
Speaker 1: We also have the best subway network on Earth.

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,510
Speaker 1: And I say this having used the subways in a lot of countries around the world.

91
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,670
Speaker 0: It's like if you look at your scoring rubric, they're not first.

92
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,110
Speaker 0: New York isn't first in every category.

93
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:43,112
Speaker 1: Oh no.

94
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,730
Speaker 1: Cleanliness, we are like near the bottom.

95
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,375
Speaker 0: Train technology.

96
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:51,050
Speaker 0: We are in bad situations in a lot of the places on the scorecard.

97
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,350
Speaker 0: But the total score, we're in first place.

98
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,410
Speaker 1: Because you've got to understand, I've got to remind people.

99
00:04:56,811 --> 00:05:00,010
Speaker 1: Because even in London, people just don't realize this.

100
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,789
Speaker 1: And they think it's insane that we do this.

101
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,190
Speaker 1: The New York City subway never stops.

102
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,710
Speaker 1: It runs 24/7.

103
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,272
Speaker 1: And it could be 3

104
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:07,312
Speaker 1: a.m.,

105
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:07,392
Speaker 1: 45 a.m.

106
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:08,376
Speaker 1: on like Christmas Day.

107
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:16,450
Speaker 1: On the least used, shittiest subway line in the city.

108
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,869
Speaker 1: And within 15 minutes, a train's going to come and get you.

109
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you might say, well, Tokyo's got to be the number one.

110
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,040
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, it's up there.

111
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:25,009
Speaker 0: It's up there.

112
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,210
Speaker 0: But they've got like five different train companies.

113
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,009
Speaker 0: And you never know which one to use.

114
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,710
Speaker 0: I'm sure the people who live there, it's fine, right?

115
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:34,868
Speaker 1: No, the people who live there complain, too.

116
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,850
Speaker 1: And also, the last time we were there, we had a pass to ride a city-run bus.

117
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,110
Speaker 1: And we got on a bus that showed up at the city bus stop around the time we expected the bus.

118
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,870
Speaker 1: But it was some private bus, and then we had to pay because it wasn't covered by the city pass.

119
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:58,590
Speaker 1: So New York City has for a long time been working on new subway cars.

120
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,470
Speaker 1: We talked about it on Geek Nights a bunch of times.

121
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,750
Speaker 1: The first of them are on the A train, like the A train in New York.

122
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,890
Speaker 1: If you're lucky, you will be on one of the brand new subway cars in New York City subway.

123
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,789
Speaker 1: We have not had new subway cars like this in a long time.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,770
Speaker 0: Well, I think we have had them.

125
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,290
Speaker 0: But what happens is basically, when the MTA gets money, they put an order for subway cars, right?

126
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:30,130
Speaker 0: The subway cars show up, but they don't order enough cars to replace every train in the whole subway system.

127
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:37,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, that alone would cost more than the 10-year budget of most of the rest of the cities in America.

128
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,430
Speaker 0: One train car is over a million dollars, and a train is several of those, right?

129
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:44,606
Speaker 0: It depends on which line it is.

130
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,130
Speaker 0: But what they do is they'll order enough for one line.

131
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:55,790
Speaker 0: And then whichever line has the oldest trains, which right now is the 1 and the A, I think.

132
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:59,950
Speaker 1: The C, I think, actually has the worst trains in the subway.

133
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,999
Speaker 0: Well, A, C, E is all sort of the same.

134
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,149
Speaker 0: The blue ones.

135
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,550
Speaker 0: But yeah, they basically replaced, they took the oldest trains out of the blue lines, and they put the newest train in on the blue lines.

136
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:13,009
Speaker 0: And now there'll be a new line that has the oldest train.

137
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,790
Speaker 0: And that one will get the next upgrades whenever that is.

138
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,568
Speaker 0: The coolest part.

139
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:27,810
Speaker 0: The thing is, because of this rolling system, you always have a mix of, like, there's always a line with the oldest trains, there's the lines with the middle-aged trains, and the lines with the new trains.

140
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:43,170
Speaker 1: Also, depending on whether or not which of the ancient subway companies ran the line when it was built, numbers versus letters, with a few weird exceptions, they upgrade on different cycles because their tracks actually have different specifications for what the car's gonna be.

141
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:49,990
Speaker 0: Well, it's like, you know, we talked about Tokyo has different train companies, like New York used to have different train companies, now it has one.

142
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

143
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:55,690
Speaker 1: One company run by the government way better than a bunch of private companies!

144
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:04,341
Speaker 1: So anyway, these new trains, the biggest deal about them is they reflect the modern needs of New York City.

145
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:10,230
Speaker 1: in that one, they have an open gangway format, meaning they are just one long open train.

146
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:15,710
Speaker 1: There's no more, like, doors between cars, it's just a long train, you can walk anywhere.

147
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:25,190
Speaker 0: Now in the showtime in a car, you can't really avoid it, well you can, you can get away immediately, but the showtime was gonna sort of come through the little gangway.

148
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:40,610
Speaker 1: Now, even worse, in New York, there's a common knowledge, if there is a packed subway, and a train rolls in, and you see that the car that you can get into is pretty empty, there is a reason it is pretty empty.

149
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,729
Speaker 1: There is some dire shit going on in that car.

150
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,250
Speaker 0: Possibly some bardle, or something.

151
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:53,150
Speaker 1: Now, it'll be a dire train, a train's gonna roll in empty, and you're gonna wonder what's up with that train.

152
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:58,889
Speaker 0: I think even in those cases, you could just be in a car far enough away from the direness to...

153
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:13,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, depending on the direness, but the other thing, they've gotten rid of a lot of seats in the format that I like that a lot of the London Underground has, where they have seats that'll come down if you want to sit in them, but they're up by default, which is good for two reasons.

154
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:22,870
Speaker 1: One, this makes way better areas for people in wheelchairs and with other accessibility accommodations to be able to get into the car, like they have a space that's better for them.

155
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:40,250
Speaker 1: And two, the reality is, in most of the subway lines in New York, during a rush hour or a crowded time, you can't really sit anyway, and actually, studies showed if they got rid of those seats, they could cram so many more people in the train than those seats could accommodate.

156
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:44,890
Speaker 0: I think it matters less on the A, but the 6 is the one where they gotta rip the seats out, right?

157
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,432
Speaker 1: Oh, the 7!

158
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:49,669
Speaker 1: The 7 should not have a single seat, except one special car that is for...

159
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:57,350
Speaker 0: The 7 needs seats, maybe not on the Express 7, but the local 7 needs seats, because that shit is long, and there's a lot of old people riding that, right?

160
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,209
Speaker 0: The 7 almost needs... The Express 7, you could take the seats out.

161
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,890
Speaker 1: The 7 could do a thing, you know what, India has, a lot of the trains in India, what they do is they have, one, they have woman-only cars.

162
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,373
Speaker 0: Isn't that?

163
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:07,890
Speaker 0: where people ride on the outside of the train?

164
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:26,190
Speaker 1: Depending on where you are, but in Mumbai and some of the cities, while that will happen, they'll have woman-only cars, but it's for people who identify as women, and it's mostly because of systemic, extreme assault and harassment issues, but sometimes they will also have cars dedicated for old people only.

165
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,789
Speaker 1: Whole car of old people.

166
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,870
Speaker 1: We could have the old person car with the seats, and everybody else, you don't get a seat.

167
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,249
Speaker 0: We should have a bike car.

168
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,608
Speaker 1: We should have a bike car.

169
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,096
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you live in New York, you can try one of these on the A train.

170
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:49,049
Speaker 1: I will, if I have an opportunity to take the A train, because it would be equivalent to something else, I'm going to try to check out one of these cars, because...

171
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, but where do you go that the A goes?

172
00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:00,950
Speaker 1: Nowhere, I guess, coming home from a Rangers game, sometimes the E doesn't run, and then the A to 42nd street is actually the fastest way home.

173
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,590
Speaker 0: And then you would have to swap, though.

174
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,931
Speaker 0: I'm going

175
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:13,890
Speaker 1: to swap to the 7, which I got to walk on the ground, which is a pro in the early part of the hockey season, but is a con in the late part of the hockey season, because it's warm out, and usually I'll take a city bike, so we'll see.

176
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,148
Speaker 0: Why don't you just do what I do and take the F to, you know...

177
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,862
Speaker 1: Well, usually what I do is take the E, which takes me directly home.

178
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,630
Speaker 1: It's the literal fastest possible way.

179
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,148
Speaker 0: I feel like the Queensbridge is closer than the...

180
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,930
Speaker 1: Nope, nope, nope, the E. Queensbridge is slightly further away than E, and also the E is so much faster.

181
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,510
Speaker 0: The F is pretty fast.

182
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,532
Speaker 1: The F is pretty fast.

183
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,257
Speaker 1: E is faster, believe me.

184
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,730
Speaker 1: I am 100% sure I would bet my life and my fortune on that.

185
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:42,840
Speaker 0: Anyway...

186
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,694
Speaker 1: Anyway, the big news.

187
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:49,344
Speaker 1: Two banks collapsed for completely unrelated reasons.

188
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,589
Speaker 1: One of those banks that collapsed was...

189
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:52,569
Speaker 0: Three banks.

190
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:54,390
Speaker 0: Well, maybe more.

191
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,730
Speaker 0: Only the second one is one that we have to spend time talking about.

192
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there might be more collapses coming.

193
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,169
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on here, but...

194
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,008
Speaker 0: But it's really just the second one that's a meaningful...

195
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the first bank that collapsed was some bullshit crypto bank.

196
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:08,450
Speaker 1: Fuck them and fuck everyone who worked with them.

197
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,579
Speaker 1: Like, I just do not care.

198
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:10,748
Speaker 1: The funniest thing...

199
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,043
Speaker 0: They failed because crypto was bad, and they were bad.

200
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:13,708
Speaker 0: It's not really complicated.

201
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,864
Speaker 1: So, crypto is up on this news, like, by a lot, and I'm not giving financial advice.

202
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:22,110
Speaker 1: I'm not a registered investment advisor.

203
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,246
Speaker 1: One, I firmly personally believe that Bitcoin and every e-cryptocurrency will go to zero.

204
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,370
Speaker 1: It's a matter of when, not if.

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,712
Speaker 1: That's a personal opinion.

206
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:54,750
Speaker 1: But two, they're up partly because people who are, in my personal opinion, extremely stupid... ...are believing that the collapse of these banks means putting your money in crypto would be safer, which is hilarious to a degree that I can't wait for them to lose their money.

207
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,590
Speaker 1: Like, I actively want to cyberbully them when they lose their money.

208
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,565
Speaker 0: It's like, these banks... The story here is that the banks are insured, and the crypto is not.

209
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,069
Speaker 0: So, it's like, what?

210
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,058
Speaker 1: Nobody who has money in the bank we're about to talk about is losing their money.

211
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,170
Speaker 1: The only people losing anything are the people who invested in the bank itself or were senior executives at the bank.

212
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,350
Speaker 0: So, effectively, the people who owned the bank are the people who are losing.

213
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,120
Speaker 1: So, Silicon Valley Bank.

214
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,270
Speaker 1: If you're not aware of this bank, which funnily enough...

215
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:39,130
Speaker 0: I was not aware of this bank until I got to my current job, and I learned that basically, not only my employer, but many, many, many tech startups, and I was even told Apple uses this bank...

216
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,062
Speaker 1: Probably, honestly, the majority.

217
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,670
Speaker 1: Like, the actual majority.

218
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,374
Speaker 0: A very large number.

219
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:51,047
Speaker 0: So, this bank started in the 80s, it's as old as we are, for Silicon Valley tech companies.

220
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,590
Speaker 0: Like, that was what they were about.

221
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,894
Speaker 0: It's just a regional bank.

222
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:58,670
Speaker 0: Like, whatever... You know, not like the big national banks, like your Chase's and your Banks of America's, right?

223
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,850
Speaker 0: But, like, those regional banks that, no matter where you go in the country, you'll always see some kind of bank that's, like, only in that town.

224
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:05,350
Speaker 0: Yup.

225
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,957
Speaker 0: You know, I used that kind of bank.

226
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,349
Speaker 0: There was some Connecticut bank I used until I moved out.

227
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:13,749
Speaker 1: The Hudson Valley Credit Union, and when I closed my account... Perfect example.

228
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,295
Speaker 1: So, fun fact, this is a while ago.

229
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:21,029
Speaker 1: Scott messaged me, and he was like, "Yeah, apparently the government owes you some

230
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:21,230
Speaker 1: money.".

231
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,030
Speaker 1: Because he was looking at that website, and I looked, and sure enough, the government owed me some money.

232
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,110
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a completely unrelated thing.

233
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:33,130
Speaker 1: Yup, because I used this local bank, and I closed my account, and I guess something went wrong, and they had a bunch of money of mine, so I got that money back.

234
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:39,710
Speaker 0: Right, so Silicon Valley Bank was a completely normal bank of that nature, just a regional bank.

235
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,270
Speaker 0: You can make a checking account there, you can get an ATM card from there, you can get a credit card from there, right?

236
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,410
Speaker 0: But, the vast majority of their customers were two kinds of people.

237
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:58,330
Speaker 0: Number one, there were Silicon Valley startup companies with business checking accounts, right, and money market accounts, and those sorts of things.

238
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:09,610
Speaker 0: And, the VC funds that invested in those startup companies, and often a lot of times you would even have the funding people tell the startups they were funding.

239
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,828
Speaker 0: Like, "Yeah, if we're going to fund you, it's going to be conditional on you using this

240
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:14,109
Speaker 0: bank.".

241
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,228
Speaker 1: Now, why would they do this?

242
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:16,370
Speaker 1: Convenience.

243
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,373
Speaker 1: It's just convenience.

244
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:29,930
Speaker 1: Imagine you have a bank where the people who work at that bank, they just really are used to and know the deal with how startups operate, and how the money gets transferred.

245
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:42,530
Speaker 1: They have specialist knowledge that makes them better at doing this, whereas a standard, generic bank might ask questions that are easily answered, or not understand, or be surprised by you cashing a $10 million check.

246
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,490
Speaker 0: If you were a startup, and you tried to go use some normal old bank, right?

247
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,789
Speaker 0: You know, your cash flow is going to be, you get funded, and millions and millions of dollars enter your account very quickly, right?

248
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,170
Speaker 1: And then no more money goes into your account for possibly years.

249
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:05,141
Speaker 0: And then money does not enter your account at all, barely, because you have almost no revenues, but you're spending like mad, and it's like, someone looks at that, and they're like, "Money laundering?

250
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:05,762
Speaker 0: Fraud?

251
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:06,482
Speaker 1: What's happening

252
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:06,743
Speaker 1: here?".

253
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:20,610
Speaker 1: And you just proceeded to spend like a million dollars every few months, just constantly, just grinding that down to zero as fast as possible.

254
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:31,070
Speaker 0: You know, normal small businesses, when they have a business account at a bank, their local bank or whatever, it's like, you know, they might get financing from that bank for various things here and there, right?

255
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,946
Speaker 0: If a startup tried to go get financing from one of those normal banks, they'd be like,

256
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:35,167
Speaker 0: "What?".

257
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:44,190
Speaker 0: No, no, this isn't, you know, it's like, normally, it would be like, I don't know, a deli wants to renovate or something, and they want to finance it, right?

258
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,870
Speaker 0: And that would be, a normal bank would figure that one out really easily, right?

259
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,147
Speaker 0: Now, the other thing is- A startup was like, "Yeah, we're going to need to, we need some financing

260
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:52,550
Speaker 0: person.".

261
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,175
Speaker 0: They'd be like, "What?

262
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:54,770
Speaker 0: No, we're not going to give you that," right?

263
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,457
Speaker 0: So, Silicon Valley Bank specialized in helping out these companies.

264
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:05,190
Speaker 0: They would also, another one of their side businesses, I guess, it's not a side business, but another thing they specialized in was mortgages.

265
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:10,490
Speaker 0: For wealthy, you know, startup people who were buying expensive houses in Silicon Valley.

266
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,250
Speaker 1: Which makes sense, because that's probably the same person they're talking to, cash, that's a million dollar check.

267
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:27,010
Speaker 0: Exactly, so this bank existed and operated as a completely normal, above the table bank, just a US bank, nothing weird about it for as long as we've lived, basically.

268
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,319
Speaker 1: And to be clear, the bank was not investing in dodgy startups.

269
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:40,470
Speaker 1: The bank was taking the money from other people who invested in dodgy startups and just managing that money for the dodgy startups.

270
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,130
Speaker 1: So, if a dodgy startup goes under, that doesn't cost the bank anything.

271
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:57,550
Speaker 0: So, you know, just the sheer basics of banking, right, is people put in money, people take out money, like you're just a mattress, but you need to make more money, because like, how do you pay your employees?

272
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:06,930
Speaker 0: It's like, the only ways a bank can make more money to pay its employees, to buy buildings, to do all, you know, to make the executives at the bank wealthy, right?

273
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:09,650
Speaker 0: They had to get money, more money than was deposited.

274
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:21,850
Speaker 1: Short of having a nationalized banking system, even if a bank was a non-profit, it still needs money to operate, and banking employees are not cheap bank tellers and people who do banking stuff.

275
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,128
Speaker 0: That's a good job, it pays well.

276
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,530
Speaker 1: It pays real well, and it's real hard.

277
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,833
Speaker 0: So, where does the bank get more money from?

278
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,779
Speaker 0: There's really two ways a bank gets more money.

279
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,587
Speaker 0: Number one, fees to customers, right?

280
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:32,650
Speaker 0: That's one way.

281
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:42,730
Speaker 0: What's the other way is, well, people deposited the money, but people aren't gonna like withdraw all their money immediately, they're gonna let most of the money just sit in the bank.

282
00:18:43,410 --> 00:19:02,230
Speaker 0: So you take people's money and you invest it in whatever, right, as long as it's not too shady, and you get interest, or you get dividends, or you buy and sell low and sell high, or you get bonds and then they mature, and you get more money by investing all the money that's just sitting in the bank doing nothing.

283
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,476
Speaker 0: And that's the revenues of the bank.

284
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:09,670
Speaker 0: is that extra on top, and if you get a whole bunch extra, you can share it with your customers, right?

285
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:18,110
Speaker 0: And the other way, which is also technically investing, is to give out loans to people with interest, and they pay back the loans, right?

286
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:27,670
Speaker 0: You've invested in someone's house when you give out a mortgage, you invested in someone's car when you give a car a loan, and then they pay it back with interest, and the interest is where the bank gets money from.

287
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,933
Speaker 1: Now one of the superpowers of the United

288
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:31,434
Speaker 0: States

289
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:37,299
Speaker 1: and a few other countries is that our banks really don't fail, like you can assume,

290
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,380
Speaker 0: regardless

291
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:48,149
Speaker 1: of everything else going on in the world, that if you've got money in a bank account, that money is there in that bank account and you can get it at any time if you want to.

292
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:58,643
Speaker 1: That is like, even as an extreme, radical communist who hates the idea of capitalism, that is a really important function for society.

293
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:02,488
Speaker 1: That is table stakes for a functioning society.

294
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,270
Speaker 1: Even communist countries need banks.

295
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:17,750
Speaker 0: Now being a bank, there's one other superpower that a bank has, which is that it can go to the Federal Reserve, the big bank, and borrow money from it at an interest rate that they had to pay back.

296
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:23,310
Speaker 1: You know when you hear the news like, "Ah, the Fed raised the rate by 50 basis points," or something, that's what they're talking about.

297
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:32,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you are a bank, and it's like, yeah, people deposited money with you, but you want even more money, you can go and borrow some, right?

298
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:33,844
Speaker 0: And then you could use that.

299
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:38,230
Speaker 0: Let's say RIM wanted to buy a house, and I'm a brand new bank, I just started, right?

300
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,277
Speaker 0: I don't have any deposits, but RIM comes in and my first customer wants a mortgage.

301
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:47,005
Speaker 0: It's like, shit, no one deposited a million dollars for the RIM house yet.

302
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:48,889
Speaker 0: How am I going to give RIM a loan?

303
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:53,410
Speaker 0: I borrow money from the Federal government, from the Federal Reserve, right?

304
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,790
Speaker 1: I just charge me more interest than the Fed charges you.

305
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:05,090
Speaker 0: I charge you more interest on the mortgage than they charge me to pay that back, and boom, I'm making money at the bank, the government's making money, RIM's getting a house, it's gonna work out, right?

306
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:13,280
Speaker 1: I want to point out, right-wing nut jobs have a weird thing about the Federal Reserve, and they say that this is evil in some way, they often put religion into it.

307
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:21,130
Speaker 1: This is actually an extremely important and foundational lever on all economic interactions of any kind.

308
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:35,347
Speaker 1: The idea that the Federal government can set this minimum interest rate, and that is a guaranteed rate that banks can borrow money, that is how the government can control the economy and prevent extremely bad things from happening.

309
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:37,790
Speaker 1: Without that lever, we are so screwed.

310
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:48,921
Speaker 0: Right, so when we want to make lots, we want to put money into the economy, we want people to spend money on things, the government lowers the interest rate, and banks go, "Ooh, a low interest rate?

311
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:57,129
Speaker 0: That means I could give money to people who want loans to go buy houses and cars and start small

312
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:57,810
Speaker 0: businesses.".

313
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,018
Speaker 0: We pump money into the economy, and people start spending it and doing stuff, right?

314
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:10,210
Speaker 0: Because the bank is getting money really cheaply at a low interest rate, and then they can charge a moderate interest rate to the customers, and it's good.

315
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:19,985
Speaker 0: Now when the interest rate goes up at the Fed, the bank's like, "Well, listen, you know, RIM wants this house, but I can't be giving RIM a loan because I've got to pay back the

316
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:20,366
Speaker 0: government.".

317
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:23,030
Speaker 0: Well, like, how many percent interest now, right?

318
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:38,350
Speaker 0: So that means I need to charge RIM a really high interest rate, and I've got to be sure that RIM is even more sure than usual that RIM has good credit and is actually going to pay, because otherwise I'm fucked because I won't be able to pay back the interest to the Federal Reserve, right?

319
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:42,081
Speaker 0: So they wanted to slow down the economy, because there's inflation.

320
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:45,010
Speaker 0: They've raised the rates recently, and they're still raising them.

321
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,833
Speaker 1: Yup, because inflation is a big problem right now globally, not just in the U.S Yup, there's too much money out there.

322
00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:51,734
Speaker 0: Money's worth less.

323
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:56,784
Speaker 0: Okay, we raise interest rates, and then there'll be less loans and less money going out.

324
00:22:57,224 --> 00:23:00,330
Speaker 0: Pretty, you know, that's the absolute most basic thing.

325
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, take, like, economic 101 in college, and this is what you learn.

326
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,816
Speaker 0: Right, so Silicon Valley Bank, what happened there?

327
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:14,230
Speaker 0: Well, all the money that comes into Silicon Valley Bank is VC funds, right, funding startups.

328
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,680
Speaker 0: That activity has slowed down, right?

329
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,110
Speaker 0: Not a lot of funding of startups going on in this economy.

330
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,579
Speaker 1: I would say not even slowed down.

331
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,450
Speaker 1: It is mostly ground to a halt.

332
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,574
Speaker 0: It's really slow, right?

333
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:27,678
Speaker 0: Dramatically slow.

334
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,166
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the startups still have accounts there, and they still exist, right?

335
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,990
Speaker 0: That is the ones that exist now.

336
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:38,237
Speaker 0: New ones aren't appearing, but there's the ones that already existed, right?

337
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:44,309
Speaker 0: And those startups were still spending like mad, because that's what they do.

338
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:44,970
Speaker 0: They're startups.

339
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:52,350
Speaker 0: They buy, they pay Amazon bills and Slack bills, and they pay employees hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to make software.

340
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not putting any money back into that bank right now.

341
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, and the startups don't have revenues, right?

342
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:00,297
Speaker 0: It's like, they're not bringing in money.

343
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:01,859
Speaker 0: They're just spending the money.

344
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:10,230
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, so, you know, the bank, you know, at some point in time, right, all the money that came in, came in, right?

345
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,154
Speaker 0: But how could the bank go under?

346
00:24:12,254 --> 00:24:19,250
Speaker 0: Well, the bank, as we said at the beginning, needs to make more money than that somehow, and it does that by investing.

347
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,899
Speaker 1: Now, that is perfectly fine.

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,570
Speaker 1: There's nothing actually wrong with this.

349
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,673
Speaker 0: That's how it's supposed to work, right?

350
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,737
Speaker 0: And what the bank did, right?

351
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:32,266
Speaker 0: What the bank did is they bought treasury bonds, 10-year treasury bonds.

352
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,368
Speaker 0: That was their investment.

353
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,710
Speaker 0: It's a very safe investment.

354
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:38,378
Speaker 0: It's a guarantee in 10 years that you buy one.

355
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,530
Speaker 0: It'll be worth more than it was when you bought it in 10 years from now, and you sell it, and you give it back to the government.

356
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,882
Speaker 0: The government gives you the money, and you have more money than you bought it for, and you even beat inflation.

357
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:50,664
Speaker 0: It's like, it's great.

358
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,227
Speaker 0: It's congratulations.

359
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,790
Speaker 0: You bought a bond and gave it back, right?

360
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,490
Speaker 0: It's, you know, it's like a savings bond, only way bigger.

361
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:05,961
Speaker 1: And the rules are basically, banks have to, they can invest some percentage of their money, and they have to keep some percentage of it in directly liquid cash to cover just day-to-day operations.

362
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:14,170
Speaker 1: Those regulations mostly came out of the '20s, and then the '30s, and the economic collapse, and Great Depression, and we regulated the banks a little bit.

363
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:16,494
Speaker 0: So really basic math, right?

364
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:21,583
Speaker 0: Investor Rim puts a million dollars into the bank, right?

365
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,607
Speaker 0: He's going to invest in some startups, right?

366
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:25,170
Speaker 0: A startup comes along.

367
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,573
Speaker 0: Rim says, "I like that

368
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:27,035
Speaker 0: startup.".

369
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:29,344
Speaker 0: He gives that startup the million dollars.

370
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:30,910
Speaker 0: It's now in the million-dollar checking account.

371
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,850
Speaker 1: Scottco, make me a social media app that's going to make me billions of dollars.

372
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:35,675
Speaker 0: All right, I'll do that.

373
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:39,170
Speaker 0: So I got a million dollars in my checking account that I'm spending at a good clip.

374
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:42,475
Speaker 0: The bank is like, "All right, the million came in.

375
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:43,556
Speaker 0: We got the million.

376
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:45,059
Speaker 0: It's going out, right?

377
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:45,780
Speaker 0: But we're a bank.

378
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,801
Speaker 0: We need to make more money.

379
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,705
Speaker 0: Let's take, I don't know, 250K of that

380
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:50,166
Speaker 0: million.".

381
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,890
Speaker 0: Scott's not going to get down to 250K that fast, right?

382
00:25:53,871 --> 00:26:13,490
Speaker 0: And we'll buy a 10-year bond, and in 10 years, by the time Scott needs that 250K at the bottom of his account, we'll sell this bond, and we'll have the 250K, and unless Scott goes to the ATM and closes his account right now, we're going to be good.

383
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:14,711
Speaker 0: And

384
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:28,630
Speaker 1: if somehow, Scott and a bunch of other people that close the account or pull all the money out of some shenanigans happen, they can borrow money from the Fed, or they can do other things like sell more stock in their own bank, because banks are often public companies you can invest in.

385
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:29,571
Speaker 0: Yep.

386
00:26:29,852 --> 00:26:31,895
Speaker 0: So that's what the bank did.

387
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:39,810
Speaker 0: And what happened was the interest rate went up, which means, you know, and then people started withdrawing money and weren't depositing money.

388
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,089
Speaker 1: Now, this is the backdrop of nobody's putting new money into the bank because nobody's investing in tech right now.

389
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:46,931
Speaker 0: Yep.

390
00:26:47,391 --> 00:27:04,430
Speaker 0: So what happened was, even though the total assets of the bank were enough to cover all the accounts that people had, right, what happened was people were drawing so much that the liquid assets of the bank, the cash they had that they could immediately use, was running out.

391
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:17,949
Speaker 0: And all their assets were these bonds, their own shares of the own stock in the company, I guess the assets of the company, like, you know, the chairs and the buildings and real estate, whatever the bank owned, right, it's still a company, right?

392
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:24,390
Speaker 0: And it couldn't really get more money from the Federal Reserve easily because the interest rate was really high.

393
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:40,410
Speaker 0: So when people started withdrawing and then creating a panic about withdrawing and their stock value went down, which meant even less cash for them, right, it was like, oh, shit, people want to withdraw money, we don't have enough.

394
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:46,130
Speaker 0: And then as soon as you're underwater, it takes about like the government comes in overnight and shuts you down.

395
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,630
Speaker 1: You ever see the movie It's a Wonderful Life out there?

396
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:49,747
Speaker 0: Yep.

397
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:51,240
Speaker 1: It's called our bank run.

398
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:52,710
Speaker 1: It's not uncommon.

399
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,210
Speaker 0: Or Mary Poppins, you see that one?

400
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

401
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:55,272
Speaker 1: And you know what?

402
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:59,057
Speaker 1: The reason this isn't a problem generally in the U.S.

403
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:07,430
Speaker 1: and in fact, still isn't a problem, because honestly, the government stepped in and did exactly what they needed to do, basically perfectly within the bounds of what Democrats are allowed to do.

404
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:20,870
Speaker 0: All of the bad things, all of the bad things that happened here happened before the bank run and then all the actions basically taken in response were the best actions that could have been taken given the circumstances.

405
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,750
Speaker 0: I don't know what you could have done better, government.

406
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,412
Speaker 0: Yep.

407
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:28,370
Speaker 1: This wasn't a bailout, like a lot of people are saying, even people who should know better on the left.

408
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:29,890
Speaker 0: No, this was not a bailout.

409
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:36,150
Speaker 1: I've seen multiple people complaining that, oh, government can't forgive student debt, but they're bailing out this bank, one.

410
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,749
Speaker 0: That has nothing to do with this whatsoever.

411
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:38,751
Speaker 1: Yep.

412
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,598
Speaker 1: So the government already insures banks.

413
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:41,400
Speaker 1: The U.S.

414
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,630
Speaker 1: government already says up to what, like $250,000.

415
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,811
Speaker 1: Right.

416
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:49,150
Speaker 0: There is a company called the FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Company.

417
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,638
Speaker 0: You see every single bank in the

418
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:50,940
Speaker 0: U.S.,

419
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,548
Speaker 0: you're going to see this thing like FDIC insured.

420
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,410
Speaker 1: Pro tip, do not put your money in a bank that is not FDIC insured.

421
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,186
Speaker 0: No, never do that.

422
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,514
Speaker 0: But the FDIC, even though it's part of the U.S.

423
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:12,450
Speaker 0: government, it's a government agency, is just an insurance company like Lloyd's of London or Geico or Allstate or, you know, Master Keaton.

424
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,050
Speaker 0: I think he was at Lloyd's of London.

425
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:17,570
Speaker 1: He was an insurance underwriter, I want to say.

426
00:29:17,732 --> 00:29:18,301
Speaker 0: Inspector.

427
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:18,830
Speaker 0: He was an inspector.

428
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,750
Speaker 0: But the point is, it's just an insurance company, right?

429
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:31,610
Speaker 0: So you're a bank and you pay insurance premiums to the FDIC the same way you pay insurance premiums on your car or your, you know, renders insurance.

430
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:43,090
Speaker 1: So that if a bank gets fucked or something bad happens, the FDIC will just cover not the bank employees, not the investors in the bank, but the regular ass people who have money in that bank.

431
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,790
Speaker 1: The FDIC will make sure that their money still exists.

432
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:46,532
Speaker 0: Right.

433
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:51,545
Speaker 0: So if a customer of the bank, you know, you go to the bank, you deposit 250K, right?

434
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:52,908
Speaker 0: At least up to 250K.

435
00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:01,670
Speaker 0: If you deposit a million in the bank in your one checking account and the bank fails utterly, there's a chance you might lose 750K.

436
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:07,244
Speaker 1: Now, that 250K is an obsolete number that was created a long time ago.

437
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:09,390
Speaker 0: And really, it should be a million.

438
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:11,258
Speaker 1: It should be maybe 10 million.

439
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:13,870
Speaker 1: I would say that banks are at least one.

440
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,738
Speaker 0: But yeah, I agree that 250K could be changed.

441
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:20,750
Speaker 0: I don't know if changing it is just a policy or needs a law to change.

442
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:21,591
Speaker 1: Yeah.

443
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:31,310
Speaker 1: Well, a big sort of side problem is that in the United States, there are some politicians like Elizabeth Warren who tried to run for president who have been pointing at the current system.

444
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,110
Speaker 0: This is definitely Elizabeth Warren's like the exact center of her wheelhouse.

445
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:41,466
Speaker 1: Elizabeth Warren has been basically saying this exact thing is going to happen a hundred percent.

446
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:42,910
Speaker 1: It is trivial to prevent.

447
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,019
Speaker 1: We just have to pass some basic modernization of banking law.

448
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,650
Speaker 1: And the fascist side of the American government said, no, that's just not right.

449
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,458
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the point is, if you deposit money in an FDIC insured U.S.

450
00:30:56,518 --> 00:31:14,630
Speaker 0: bank as a normal old customer, no matter what happens, the FDIC, because it's an insurance company, they will come in and guarantee that 250,000 of your dollars are safe, even if the bank turns out to be the worst criminal, garbage, fuck-up bank that ever fucked up.

451
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,190
Speaker 1: And then they will deal with, via the government, how to fuck over the bank that fucked over its customers.

452
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,654
Speaker 0: So what about the rest?

453
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:26,347
Speaker 0: If I put a million in the bank, I get the 250K, what happens to the rest of my 750K?

454
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:30,339
Speaker 0: Well, what happens is the FDIC will sort of give you a note.

455
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,669
Speaker 0: It's like a promissory note, kind of like, you know, sort of.

456
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,670
Speaker 0: And it basically says, it's a note that's like, you used to have 750K in this bank that wasn't insured.

457
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:47,850
Speaker 0: And the FDIC will then take all the assets the bank has left, right, whatever is left, and it will say, all right, what can we sell this for?

458
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:55,110
Speaker 0: And it will try to sell everything the bank has, usually to another bigger bank or, you know, whoever.

459
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,320
Speaker 0: It'll find ways to just turn the bank's remaining assets into money.

460
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:07,241
Speaker 0: And at the end, it'll look at that pool of money, and it'll divide it up, and everyone can cash in their note for whatever that amount of money is.

461
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:08,926
Speaker 0: That might take a while.

462
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:10,210
Speaker 0: That won't happen quickly.

463
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:15,439
Speaker 0: You could try to sell your note to someone else, usually at like a discount.

464
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,450
Speaker 0: So it's like, I got a note for 750K, it probably won't even be worth 750K if I wait a long time.

465
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:33,885
Speaker 0: Maybe someone will give me 500K for it right now, and that person can afford to wait for the 600, and they're happy to make free money, and I need money immediately because I have a business and I got to pay my employees.

466
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,149
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

467
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,453
Speaker 0: What happened here?

468
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:39,617
Speaker 0: The FDIC did its normal deal.

469
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:40,218
Speaker 0: It came in.

470
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:49,956
Speaker 0: It's like, they operate so fast, and it's like people talk about bureaucracy and the government sucks, and it's like, yeah, a lot of agencies in the government suck, whatever, right?

471
00:32:50,457 --> 00:33:01,821
Speaker 0: The FDIC is like the example that shows if you fund and well train and support a government agency, it can operate like, you know, like German trains.

472
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,450
Speaker 0: Like the FDIC is the German train of the US.

473
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,823
Speaker 1: Imagine if FEMA was funded properly when we had Hurricane Katrina.

474
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:11,330
Speaker 1: There would have been a literal army of people helping.

475
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,117
Speaker 0: Just put FDIC in charge of FEMA.

476
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,385
Speaker 0: But they come in to the bank, right?

477
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:19,430
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it literally is like a movie.

478
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,564
Speaker 1: They do it like they show up at the bank store and they're just like, yeah, we fucking, we're taking over.

479
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:24,487
Speaker 1: Fuck all of you.

480
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:25,310
Speaker 1: Let us in.

481
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,975
Speaker 0: They go through all the computers.

482
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,279
Speaker 0: They talk to all the employees.

483
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,144
Speaker 0: They go to all the, they find all the cash.

484
00:33:30,164 --> 00:33:31,950
Speaker 0: They, you know, bag it up and count it.

485
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,900
Speaker 0: And it's like, they're, they, they basically raid the bank and take everything and sell it.

486
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,865
Speaker 0: And it's like this shit, right?

487
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,050
Speaker 0: We're, we're talking on the show on Monday, right?

488
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,134
Speaker 0: These banks failed what, Thursday?

489
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,377
Speaker 1: Thursday, Friday, right?

490
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:48,424
Speaker 0: By Sunday night, they were auctioning the banks, right?

491
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:51,790
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they come in and it's like, they work around the clock.

492
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:53,672
Speaker 0: They fly in.

493
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:59,722
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, on Monday morning at the start of business, right?

494
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,685
Speaker 0: We, you know, my company, right?

495
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:04,970
Speaker 0: Just, you know, they, our money was in that Silicon Valley bank.

496
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,976
Speaker 0: They couldn't get the money out because the bank was closed.

497
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:11,924
Speaker 0: Sure enough on Monday morning, there's the money.

498
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,987
Speaker 0: It's like, there it goes.

499
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:14,630
Speaker 0: They made it work.

500
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,030
Speaker 0: I'm going to get paid, I guess, which is good because I wasn't going to work if I wasn't going to get paid.

501
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,536
Speaker 1: So the government basically did everything right here.

502
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaker 1: The bank will see exactly the situation that happened.

503
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:38,389
Speaker 1: But regardless of if any of the executives foresaw this or sold their stock early or anything that we'll see in the coming, those are separate, those are separate issues.

504
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:38,811
Speaker 1: Yeah.

505
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:47,389
Speaker 1: The real buried lead here to turn this back into a tech story is that nobody's fucking investing in dodgy tech startups anymore.

506
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:56,449
Speaker 1: Like that ship just hit a reef and that is the actual, I'm not going to say problem.

507
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:08,990
Speaker 1: That is a big deal because a huge part of the modern American world relies terrifyingly too much on tech startups that have no revenue.

508
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:18,561
Speaker 1: And the only reason those companies exist is because they either always expected like Amazon or Google would buy them, which guess who's not doing that anymore.

509
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:24,450
Speaker 1: or VCs will come in with more rounds of money or new VCs will fund new companies that replace them.

510
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:26,213
Speaker 1: None of that's happening anymore.

511
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:34,610
Speaker 1: There is way more rot in American capitalism and this is a symptom of a far more wide reaching problem.

512
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:43,169
Speaker 1: And as a secondary point, this would have been trivially presented by basic modernization of banking regulation, which our government is incapable of right now.

513
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:55,170
Speaker 0: So the end result is the FDIC treasury and federal reserve came in and they did something, I guess, slightly exceptional, but at no cost to taxpayers whatsoever.

514
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:56,171
Speaker 0: Right.

515
00:35:56,492 --> 00:36:07,710
Speaker 0: They're basically guaranteeing that everyone who had deposits, even above the 250K, right, your whole deposit, if you were at this bank or, or also the signature bank, which went down today.

516
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,151
Speaker 0: Right.

517
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:15,843
Speaker 0: Um, but basically all your money that was in that bank, even above the 250K, it's there, you didn't lose anything.

518
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:19,529
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry about the promissory note, whatever they call it.

519
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:19,830
Speaker 0: Right.

520
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,932
Speaker 0: You know, you're, you're.

521
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,014
Speaker 0: all the money is there.

522
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,077
Speaker 0: You're good to go.

523
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,727
Speaker 0: And the people who's, you know, it's like, well, someone lost on this deal, right?

524
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:28,950
Speaker 0: Who lost money?

525
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:32,758
Speaker 0: The owners of the bank, the shareholders in the banks got fucked.

526
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,261
Speaker 0: No one's bailing them out.

527
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:34,883
Speaker 0: Right.

528
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:38,250
Speaker 0: If you own shares in Silicon Valley bank, they are now worthless.

529
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,396
Speaker 0: There are some people who claim that they sold short cause they saw it coming.

530
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:45,562
Speaker 0: And those people, I guess, are very wealthy now.

531
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:46,464
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,930
Speaker 0: And whoever let them borrow shares is in the shit now.

533
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,990
Speaker 1: Just to make sure they didn't know anything that wasn't public and allowed to be used to make that kind of decision.

534
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,090
Speaker 0: Yep.

535
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:05,086
Speaker 0: And you know, they think on the one hand that's good because, you know, some of those shareholders were evil capitalist people who deserve to get fucked.

536
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:05,607
Speaker 0: Right.

537
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:07,210
Speaker 0: And that's good news that they got fucked.

538
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:16,530
Speaker 0: They found out, but in bad news, you know, some of those investors were like, Hey, Ed's retirement plan and Ed got his retirement plan is losing value.

539
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:29,127
Speaker 1: Of course, I would say that predicating retirement on investing in capitalist structures via markets feels like a extremely fucked up way to do that.

540
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:30,429
Speaker 1: But that's a separate topic.

541
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,677
Speaker 0: But yeah, this rocked the world.

542
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:38,870
Speaker 0: If this hadn't gone this way, it might have been a truly devastating news.

543
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:44,759
Speaker 1: If they had not stepped in on this, this could have turned into, you'll hear a lot of finance.

544
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,141
Speaker 1: people would call it a contagion.

545
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:52,470
Speaker 1: There's still a low key contagion happening, but we would have seen more banks fail like by today.

546
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,331
Speaker 0: Yeah.

547
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:59,903
Speaker 0: But not even that, but like literally every startup would not have been able to make payroll and all the software engineers wouldn't have gone to work.

548
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:04,070
Speaker 0: And then there would all those, like all these websites to just shut down overnight.

549
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:15,070
Speaker 1: Imagine if I'm going to make up, cause I don't know who uses the bank and how much exposure they have, but imagine if like square payment processing and Grubhub and Uber just stopped working today.

550
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:15,850
Speaker 0: Right.

551
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,734
Speaker 0: Well, to give you two examples, right.

552
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:23,565
Speaker 0: Etsy had to like basically stop making payments out to people who sold stuff on Etsy.

553
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,829
Speaker 0: And I guess they were able to probably continue them now.

554
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,150
Speaker 0: Right.

555
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:36,450
Speaker 0: But Etsy had a lot of money in that bank, their bank, and they couldn't like, if you sold your shit on Etsy and then, you know, whoever bought your shit paid Etsy and Etsy then was going to pay you the craft person.

556
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:39,694
Speaker 0: They had to delay those payments until I presume today.

557
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:46,945
Speaker 0: Also, I saw a report that said Roblox, the child labor company, right.

558
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:49,890
Speaker 0: Had like a hundred million plus in the, in that bank.

559
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:58,685
Speaker 0: And so Roblox would just could have, if they, if they lost all but two 50 K Roblox would just disappear off the face of the earth.

560
00:38:59,186 --> 00:38:59,948
Speaker 0: If they lost $999 million.

561
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,637
Speaker 1: Imagine what would happen if Roblox disappeared right now, like overnight.

562
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,059
Speaker 0: Roblox is there last week.

563
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:13,030
Speaker 1: in this today, they just got millions of parents who are not terminally online.

564
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,830
Speaker 0: All the people who have Robux, they're worthless now, you can't use them.

565
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:28,590
Speaker 1: Millions of parents who don't know about how the internet works would suddenly be confronted with children who are screaming and crying and having an existential crisis that they one do not understand and two have no way to fix.

566
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,913
Speaker 0: That could have happened.

567
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:37,289
Speaker 0: We could, it could have been if the, if the government of the United States in this one area was not as competent as it is.

568
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:38,532
Speaker 1: The moral of this.

569
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:48,930
Speaker 1: large, large, competent governments that are actually beholden to the people are very effective at solving large, difficult problems.

570
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,371
Speaker 1: Contrary to the popular belief of people who don't know better.

571
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,876
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

572
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:08,180
Speaker 1: So I grew up, Scott grew up, many of you probably are too young to remember an era when every car didn't have air conditioning.

573
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,366
Speaker 1: Like now, like pretty much any car has air conditioning.

574
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,050
Speaker 0: In the US.

575
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,535
Speaker 0: In my early life we had cars that had air conditioning.

576
00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:19,320
Speaker 1: We had the good car with air conditioning and the other cars that didn't.

577
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:29,320
Speaker 1: At RIT, my first car didn't have air conditioning, my second car did and then it didn't when it broke at one point as we discovered driving a Wildwood one time together.

578
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:41,939
Speaker 1: But air conditioning actually makes cars more efficient because the reality is you're driving a car, let's skip the whole, like we actually have to ban cars fundamentally, but assuming they're here.

579
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,026
Speaker 1: Cars get extremely hot in the sun, like dangerously hot.

580
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:48,248
Speaker 1: They have to be cooled.

581
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:55,900
Speaker 1: Rolling down the windows and just like doing things like that don't actually cool cars that much and actually make them even less efficient.

582
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,900
Speaker 0: Aerodynamically speaking.

583
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, air conditioning, modern air conditioning is extremely efficient at keeping cars cool and reasonable, but that didn't exist a long time ago in the way we have today.

584
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,822
Speaker 1: So this video was making the rounds.

585
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,084
Speaker 1: It's a short TikTok.

586
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:12,205
Speaker 1: It's less than a minute long.

587
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:23,440
Speaker 1: that explains one of the ways you could cool a car in the 1950s and actually it's a pretty effective way of cooling a car with an asterisk.

588
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,883
Speaker 1: It only works in places that have low humidity.

589
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:30,990
Speaker 1: It's basically a swamp cooler that hangs out your window and it's a pretty cool thing.

590
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:38,040
Speaker 1: My grandpa had a truck from the 50s that he kept until near the end of his life and he kept it functional.

591
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,842
Speaker 1: It had two notable things going on.

592
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:56,556
Speaker 1: One, it had two gas tanks and you could flip a switch to flip between the two gas tanks and two, it had vents in the front of the car that you could open that would funnel air from intakes in the front of the car into the cabin directly and had exhaust in the back.

593
00:41:56,776 --> 00:41:59,859
Speaker 1: because it was designed, this car was actually from the 40s.

594
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:05,199
Speaker 1: So this is just a pretty cool thing that I don't think any of you have ever seen.

595
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Speaker 0: My favorite old school way to cool a motor vehicle that doesn't have its own cooling is still the super old school butcher delivery truck where they would go to the slaughterhouse, they would get all the meats, hang them up in a truck and just throw a bucket of dry ice in there and close the door.

596
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,267
Speaker 1: That only works for the back of the car where the dead meat is.

597
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:28,680
Speaker 1: If you put that in the front of the car with the live meat, you'll have two compartments full of dead meat.

598
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,762
Speaker 0: That's correct.

599
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:33,633
Speaker 0: But it's great for the back of the truck.

600
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,177
Speaker 0: Just a bucket of dry ice, close the door.

601
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,792
Speaker 1: Even when we were in college and there was no air conditioning in our shitty apartment and then we were like, "Why don't we just get a bucket of dry ice?

602
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:43,353
Speaker 1: That would solve

603
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:43,634
Speaker 1: things.".

604
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:46,680
Speaker 1: And then it took us about 10 seconds to realize that was a terrible idea.

605
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,441
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:48,161
Speaker 0: All right.

607
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:51,343
Speaker 0: My thing of the day, thanks to the listener for this excellent thing of the day.

608
00:42:52,364 --> 00:43:13,800
Speaker 0: If you are old enough to have used cassette players, CD players, DVD players, these sorts of things in the 80s and 90s, maybe even 2000s before, I guess, basically the pre-LCD era, before iPods, basically, all those devices typically had what's known as a VFD display, a vacuum fluorescent display.

609
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:16,803
Speaker 0: Once you see one, you'll say, "Oh, that kind of

610
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:17,324
Speaker 0: display.".

611
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:22,951
Speaker 0: And this person on YouTube named Posey made a great video about VFDs.

612
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:26,915
Speaker 0: And I really like this video because it's a combo video.

613
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:30,900
Speaker 0: On the one hand, it's educational about VFDs.

614
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:50,756
Speaker 0: How they worked, zooming in on them with a microscope, looking at how different filters and colors and different designs and all sorts of educational things, but also is an aesthetic video with music playing and showing you them in a very nostalgic feel.

615
00:43:56,461 --> 00:44:04,140
Speaker 1: The style of VFDs, like the kinds of displays you can make with that tech is a style that speaks to me personally and viscerally.

616
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:12,188
Speaker 0: I want to make like, you know, it's like, hey, these were designed that way because of the technology, but it's like, it's a great design.

617
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:13,609
Speaker 0: I would love to have user interface.

618
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:16,051
Speaker 0: You know, people have done, Winamp skins have done this, right?

619
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:24,400
Speaker 0: But it's like, what if your whole, you know, the, you know, Star Trek, actually, all the Star Trek user interfaces are the same aesthetic as this.

620
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

621
00:44:25,141 --> 00:44:28,286
Speaker 1: Even the newer, we're watching a lot of the newer Star Treks and same kind of thing.

622
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:31,411
Speaker 1: And also there was an era when LCDs got good enough.

623
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:37,240
Speaker 1: There were a bunch of LCDs that would be designed to try to look like VFD styling.

624
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:41,753
Speaker 0: You know, like how cool would it be if your whole computer operating system had this aesthetic?

625
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:42,415
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

626
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:42,997
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

627
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:43,820
Speaker 0: Anyway.

628
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:45,718
Speaker 1: Vaporwave me up, Danny.

629
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,590
Speaker 0: It's an S tier video.

630
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:48,660
Speaker 0: Thank you, the listener.

631
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:55,038
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the geek nights book club book is the satanic versus by Sam and Rushdie.

632
00:44:55,098 --> 00:44:55,780
Speaker 1: I read the beginning.

633
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,930
Speaker 0: The fact that this didn't even get the book yet.

634
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,220
Speaker 1: So what I'll say is I've never read anything from Sam and Rushdie other than some essays.

635
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,039
Speaker 0: Me either.

636
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,205
Speaker 1: His prose is, this is S tier prose.

637
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:14,107
Speaker 1: I'm just going to say it right now.

638
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:27,860
Speaker 1: Read the first chapter, read the first paragraph and you, anyone who would try to kill this man for having written this prose is, is just vile and dangerous to society.

639
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:42,040
Speaker 1: But also, uh, you know, the, the trope of a good angel and a bad angel, but they're also kind of buddies and they're kind of like the evil ones, not actually that good or not that bad.

640
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,323
Speaker 1: And the good ones not actually that good.

641
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:44,305
Speaker 1: Like, yes.

642
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:50,518
Speaker 0: Uh, this is also that, uh, this, uh, I go, I haven't read one of those in a while, but I know the type.

643
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:51,260
Speaker 1: I like that type.

644
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:52,463
Speaker 1: I like that type a lot.

645
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:55,532
Speaker 1: That's a trope that, uh, I've enjoyed my whole life.

646
00:45:55,893 --> 00:45:58,500
Speaker 1: And, uh, yeah, this book is, uh, right in that.

647
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,320
Speaker 0: Neil Gaiman is good at those, right?

648
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:10,754
Speaker 1: Uh, the first chapter is one of the best opening acts of a long novel I've read in a long time because it hits you hard.

649
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,660
Speaker 1: It doesn't give you time to process what you're reading the pros.

650
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,024
Speaker 1: It's just going to pull you along.

651
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:20,737
Speaker 1: I am already deeply invested in this book, having read 18 paragraphs.

652
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:23,580
Speaker 0: Okay.

653
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,367
Speaker 0: Uh, the final metamoment bit is the website is progressing, uh, rapidly.

654
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:37,400
Speaker 0: It is still, there's still some work to do, but we are nearing the end of getting the things done we need to do to replace the current website.

655
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:42,720
Speaker 0: Um, and then there's still many other things to do after that, but we may hit that time.

656
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,035
Speaker 0: Yup.

657
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,326
Speaker 1: So, so we went on long as we do when we skip shows.

658
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:50,434
Speaker 1: So to get right into the main bit, e-waste is a big problem.

659
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,460
Speaker 1: One of the biggest problems in society right now.

660
00:46:54,081 --> 00:47:00,960
Speaker 1: Uh, mostly e-waste, the burden of e-waste is borne by the poorest people on earth in the least supported places on earth.

661
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Speaker 1: Uh, and we're going to try to talk about what you in an industrialized society where you are insulated from the consequences of not dealing with it.

662
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:22,780
Speaker 1: Well, kind of how to deal with it, because if you're listening to Geek Nights, you're probably, I imagine, you have at least one of every kind of cable you have ever owned in your entire life, just in case.

663
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:35,320
Speaker 1: I imagine you've got a box or a bag or a bin somewhere filled with a whole bunch of shit that you have collected through the years of owning and building computers that you keep around because you might need it.

664
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,284
Speaker 1: And you might have like a monitor.

665
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:44,640
Speaker 1: that's kind of shitty, but no one wants it and you don't want to throw it away because you feel bad, but literally no one on earth wants this monitor.

666
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, for example, I'm currently was doing a lot of cleaning of electronic stuff, right?

667
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,833
Speaker 0: And I had a bunch of hard drives and it's like, you know, I got an S.A.T.A.

668
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:57,657
Speaker 0: six gigabit per second magnetic hard drive.

669
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:58,579
Speaker 0: that's 500 gigabytes.

670
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,517
Speaker 1: I've got a three gigabit per second 500 gigabyte hard drive.

671
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,291
Speaker 0: I'm just saying like it's 500 gigabyte hard drive, a big three and a half inch magnetic hard drive.

672
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:10,700
Speaker 0: And it's like you could get terabyte hard drives for like nothing.

673
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

674
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:12,905
Speaker 0: These days, very low prices.

675
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:18,720
Speaker 0: And it's like even if I try to give it away for free, it's like, why would someone at least in New York City want it?

676
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:30,920
Speaker 0: It's like they would have to be extremely desperate for like any amount of storage because like you could get vastly much more storage in much smaller like an SSD for less money.

677
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,461
Speaker 0: Right.

678
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:32,282
Speaker 0: And it's even worse.

679
00:48:32,302 --> 00:48:43,120
Speaker 1: Like if you there are people in the world, if you look globally, who could definitely use that hard drive, but the cost of getting it to someone, not even just not even the transportation.

680
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,266
Speaker 0: Find me finding that person, making a connection with them.

681
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:48,147
Speaker 0: Right.

682
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:57,020
Speaker 0: And agreeing to it is the harder even than the transport, which would which would still be extreme for the cost to send them the hard drive.

683
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:04,212
Speaker 1: And not even the dollar cost, but the external cost, like the carbon cost of that shipping is worth talking about the total cost.

684
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:09,400
Speaker 1: that is probably worse than just giving them money so they can buy a modern hard drive.

685
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,901
Speaker 0: Exactly.

686
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:21,720
Speaker 0: It would be cheaper for me to wire them money to buy a better brand new hard drive where they live in most places on earth than for me to somehow package this hard drive and deliver it to them.

687
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:31,820
Speaker 1: Now, I will say, too, while it is not illegal in many parts of the US because America has a fucked up system to throw things like that away, it is illegal here to just throw that away.

688
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,860
Speaker 1: Like in New York, it is illegal to put that in the regular garbage as it should.

689
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,281
Speaker 1: Correct.

690
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:37,263
Speaker 0: Correct.

691
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:39,389
Speaker 0: So how do I have this thing?

692
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:40,231
Speaker 0: I don't need it.

693
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,193
Speaker 0: I have no use for it.

694
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:42,256
Speaker 0: It is functioning.

695
00:49:42,557 --> 00:49:43,800
Speaker 0: I erased all my data from it.

696
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,682
Speaker 0: That's a separate issue.

697
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:44,943
Speaker 0: Right.

698
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:51,379
Speaker 0: And there's there's no economical way for me to find someone who wants it and give it to them.

699
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:51,800
Speaker 0: Right.

700
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,525
Speaker 0: I mean, I put a posting online to see if anyone wants it.

701
00:49:54,886 --> 00:50:02,100
Speaker 0: And some of my larger drives for terabytes, two terabytes, I was able to give those away occasionally, even for money to local people.

702
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,561
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:03,883
Speaker 0: The best possible result.

704
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:07,630
Speaker 0: But some I found a listener to take some for free.

705
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:08,171
Speaker 0: Right.

706
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:09,814
Speaker 0: Which is very fortuitous.

707
00:50:09,994 --> 00:50:11,597
Speaker 0: But that's really.

708
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:13,300
Speaker 0: nobody else wanted to take them at all.

709
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,621
Speaker 0: Yeah.

710
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:18,492
Speaker 0: And that listener only wanted them as like, you know, hobby extra drives or whatever.

711
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:18,752
Speaker 0: Right.

712
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:20,957
Speaker 0: Like they weren't useful in any way.

713
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:21,338
Speaker 0: Right.

714
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,964
Speaker 0: But it's like if no one really.

715
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,627
Speaker 0: what the hell are you supposed to do with this thing?

716
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:31,996
Speaker 0: Well, you can take it for e-cycling right to your local e-cycle state.

717
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:33,558
Speaker 0: I think, you know, Staples take stuff.

718
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,440
Speaker 0: Best I take stuff.

719
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,321
Speaker 1: They'll take some stuff.

720
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:37,204
Speaker 1: That's sort of the crux of this.

721
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:48,360
Speaker 1: The first thing you should try to do is just check out all your social media and free tables and just see, is there anyone in your orbit who for relatively low effort wants the thing?

722
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,307
Speaker 0: Because the closer they are geographically, the better.

723
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:51,788
Speaker 0: Right.

724
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:55,780
Speaker 0: Handing it to someone just who lives near you is like the best possible thing.

725
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,321
Speaker 1: Yep.

726
00:50:57,001 --> 00:51:02,729
Speaker 1: But to after that, look at big box stores, even though they're disappearing, like.

727
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:07,415
Speaker 1: it's amazing that Staples and places will even take this stuff because they even sell electronics.

728
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:11,560
Speaker 1: But while they still exist, try to find a place that will take it.

729
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:22,420
Speaker 1: But you'll have to do some research because there's a lot of different kinds of waste and every kind of place you could take it to will have different rules and what they will and will not take.

730
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:23,421
Speaker 0: Yep.

731
00:51:23,642 --> 00:51:24,243
Speaker 0: Very important.

732
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:34,860
Speaker 1: And it gets hard because like a lot of e-waste, like I have a lot of e-waste in the apartment and most of it is stuff I've had for a good chunk of my life.

733
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,083
Speaker 1: And I'm finally deciding to just get rid of it.

734
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:51,760
Speaker 1: So a lot of it is like cables that no one will take that are useless to anybody to the point that some of this stuff I got to hold out until one of those amnesty days that New York City has that most of the world doesn't have where they'll fucking take anything.

735
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:56,005
Speaker 0: It's not an amnesty day, it's Safe Disposal Day.

736
00:51:56,266 --> 00:52:05,597
Speaker 0: What's actually happening on Safe Disposal Day is that private e-waste companies that have partnered with the Department of Sanitation are setting up shop in the park.

737
00:52:06,478 --> 00:52:07,920
Speaker 0: It's not like an amnesty.

738
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:20,520
Speaker 1: But what their hope is that people who have dodgy stuff will just take everything there, no questions asked, because they can then sort it into all the different types of companies that could take and deal with different kinds of things.

739
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:28,180
Speaker 1: Because the way you deal with an old light bulb is very different from how you deal with an old battery or an old CRT or an old hard drive.

740
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:34,167
Speaker 0: So what the e-waste companies in your area are doing varies greatly, right?

741
00:52:34,268 --> 00:52:38,873
Speaker 0: Some of them might be doing things like, "Oh, this still works.

742
00:52:39,214 --> 00:52:44,060
Speaker 0: Let's see how many computers I can put together and we'll put those in schools for the kids to learn

743
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:44,260
Speaker 0: on.".

744
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,007
Speaker 0: Or give them to people who are so unfortunate that they can't even buy the cheapest computer.

745
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:53,151
Speaker 0: It's like, "Alright, well, here's a computer that goes on the internet.

746
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,092
Speaker 0: It has a web browser.

747
00:52:54,152 --> 00:52:55,734
Speaker 0: It's better than absolutely nothing.

748
00:52:55,774 --> 00:52:59,739
Speaker 0: It's slow and weird, but hey, it's a computer for nothing.

749
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:00,020
Speaker 0: Here you

750
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,220
Speaker 0: go.".

751
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,945
Speaker 0: Some of them are like, "Alright, this TV only needed a new capacitor.

752
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,928
Speaker 0: We fixed it and now we'll resell it and get some

753
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:07,249
Speaker 0: money.".

754
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:10,694
Speaker 0: Some of them might be doing that sort of stuff.

755
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,837
Speaker 0: Some of them might be saying, "Alright, this doesn't work.

756
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:14,419
Speaker 0: There's no way we can make it

757
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:14,620
Speaker 0: work.".

758
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,765
Speaker 0: But inside of it, there is a valuable magnet.

759
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:22,072
Speaker 0: We can harvest the valuable materials.

760
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:23,294
Speaker 0: "Ah, there's some tungsten in this

761
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:23,575
Speaker 0: one.".

762
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:26,580
Speaker 0: Stuff like that can happen.

763
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,883
Speaker 1: And in the worst case scenario, they might even just still be like, "Yeah, they're just going to throw it

764
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:31,143
Speaker 1: away.".

765
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:41,851
Speaker 1: But instead of just putting it in the general stream of waste that ends up in a landfill or an incinerator or something, they are regulated, at least depending on where you are.

766
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:43,452
Speaker 1: Watch out if you're in certain states.

767
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:51,538
Speaker 1: They're regulated, they'll follow the laws, and they will dispose of it in the way that is required or at least that does the least harm.

768
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:53,860
Speaker 1: And if they don't, they can get in trouble.

769
00:53:54,361 --> 00:54:01,309
Speaker 0: And now the worst possible result is not even just it ending up in the regular trash and going to Staten Island to sit in a heap.

770
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:02,310
Speaker 0: That's real bad.

771
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:11,160
Speaker 0: But even worse is if it goes to a heap somewhere else in the world where there are child laborers digging through looking for something that has a trace of gold on it.

772
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:28,817
Speaker 0: And then there's some horrible, environmentally damaging process where they extract the tiniest amounts of rare, valuable elements from all the electronic waste that gives everyone there gets cancer and poisons all the land nearby.

773
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:32,180
Speaker 0: And that's happening in a lot of places.

774
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:44,297
Speaker 1: Yep, because the reality is recycling is a complex process and e-waste is a new threat to society that we we haven't really dealt with the last four or five major threats in this type of space.

775
00:54:44,578 --> 00:54:45,940
Speaker 1: And this is just yet a newer one.

776
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,679
Speaker 0: So what can you, you know, the best thing you can do?

777
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,420
Speaker 1: Not buy useless shit, buy as little as possible.

778
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:53,281
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:59,086
Speaker 0: The the real solution is to avoid the problem in the first place.

780
00:54:59,166 --> 00:54:59,386
Speaker 0: Right.

781
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:03,390
Speaker 0: You want to not you know, if something is still good.

782
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,090
Speaker 0: Right.

783
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:05,091
Speaker 0: Don't replace it.

784
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:06,012
Speaker 0: I was some fool.

785
00:55:06,332 --> 00:55:08,214
Speaker 0: I was buying iPhones every two years.

786
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:08,574
Speaker 0: Right.

787
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:13,099
Speaker 0: And for those first few years, I would like take the old phone and give it to someone I knew who didn't.

788
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,520
Speaker 0: It was better than the phone they had.

789
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:14,720
Speaker 0: Right.

790
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:14,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

791
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:19,450
Speaker 0: But then it's like once I got the iPhone seven, it's like, you know, who wants it?

792
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,654
Speaker 0: I'm trying to sell an iPhone seven on eBay right now.

793
00:55:21,774 --> 00:55:22,095
Speaker 0: It's like.

794
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:23,097
Speaker 0: it's like five bucks.

795
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:23,879
Speaker 0: Like no one wants this.

796
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:24,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

797
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,368
Speaker 0: It's like keep it and use it for as long as you can.

798
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,792
Speaker 0: When iPhone eight, nine, ten came out, I was like, you know what?

799
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,195
Speaker 0: The seven is still working fine.

800
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:35,638
Speaker 0: Why would I buy a new one?

801
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:36,660
Speaker 0: for no reason?

802
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,483
Speaker 1: I'm not going to get a 14 because this thing works fine.

803
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:42,565
Speaker 1: I'll get iPhone 12 mini.

804
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:45,827
Speaker 0: And it's like I'm paying Apple for Apple Care.

805
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:49,270
Speaker 0: Like every month, you know, the app, the two year Apple Care on the iPhone 12 mini ran out.

806
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,512
Speaker 0: I'm paying Apple like nine bucks a month.

807
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:52,232
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:53,133
Speaker 0: But you know what?

809
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:56,196
Speaker 0: That's going to extend the life of this iPhone 12 mini.

810
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:58,477
Speaker 0: Hopefully five, six, seven years.

811
00:55:58,497 --> 00:55:59,338
Speaker 0: Right.

812
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,560
Speaker 0: Avoid having to buy another new phone.

813
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:01,860
Speaker 0: Right.

814
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,270
Speaker 0: The phone, you know, by the time if they come out with, I don't know, six G and the phone isn't, you know, I need.

815
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:12,360
Speaker 0: I want to get a new one, then I could probably find someone who would take it right for more than five bucks.

816
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,125
Speaker 1: I brought the same ancient Android phone for like four years.

817
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:20,632
Speaker 1: And the only reason I upgraded was because the battery didn't last at all anymore.

818
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:26,360
Speaker 1: And so multiple spectrum changes happened to the point that the phone actually did not work anymore.

819
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:27,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

820
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:31,188
Speaker 0: It's like there's usually a way to find a way to keep something going.

821
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:37,160
Speaker 0: It's like especially in the current climate where there's all these incremental upgrades instead of significant ones.

822
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:37,600
Speaker 0: Yeah.

823
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,385
Speaker 0: It's like, do you really need the switch OLED?

824
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:43,670
Speaker 0: Because if you already if you don't have a switch, yeah, get the OLED one.

825
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,471
Speaker 0: Obviously it's better.

826
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:50,220
Speaker 0: But it's like if you got a switch and I guess you could find someone to take an old switch pretty easily still.

827
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:52,589
Speaker 0: But it's just a good example of like.

828
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,956
Speaker 0: you don't need that minor upgrade.

829
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:54,800
Speaker 0: You can skip on that.

830
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,261
Speaker 1: Well, I have the same.

831
00:56:56,301 --> 00:57:16,080
Speaker 1: Now, one thing you can do if, you know, you're listening to geek nights, if you're the kind of nerd who has money, the philosophy that we talked about an old geek nights and it comes up time and time again is if you can, if you're going to buy something by the minimum viable thing necessary to accomplish your goal or by the best possible thing.

832
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:22,228
Speaker 1: So what I've always done, and this is this is only something you can do if you have the privilege of having piles of money.

833
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:30,600
Speaker 1: Every time I build a new computer, I overbuild it so that I will not have to upgrade it or replace it for as long as possible.

834
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:42,980
Speaker 1: I'm still rocking an Intel i6, not i6, the K, the six, whatever, six generation 6700K, the one that everyone bought like six years ago.

835
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,019
Speaker 1: Windows 11 won't even run on this thing.

836
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,044
Speaker 0: Now, what can the industry do?

837
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:54,120
Speaker 0: Well, what the industry can do is really, you know, I guess this has been unpopular in some places.

838
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,840
Speaker 0: I know there was a thing in Brazil, but like Apple stopped putting chargers in there and cables.

839
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:00,204
Speaker 0: I think that's a good thing.

840
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:04,778
Speaker 1: I have so many USB charges that are just garbage because I don't need them.

841
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:05,480
Speaker 0: I have an anchor.

842
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,330
Speaker 0: I got a whole bag of like cables and stuff that like I don't need.

843
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:12,760
Speaker 1: I filled three fresh Shurex bags with old cables I didn't need.

844
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,063
Speaker 0: Three?

845
00:58:13,124 --> 00:58:13,367
Speaker 0: Wow.

846
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:14,460
Speaker 0: I've got like half a bag.

847
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,100
Speaker 1: Well, some of that was like cables for old Atari's that no one wanted, like literally no one wanted them.

848
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,579
Speaker 1: Some of that was old audio cables that didn't work anymore, but I kept them because I kept having ideas of fixing them.

849
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:28,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got like, you know, I just had too many HDMI cables.

850
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:32,037
Speaker 0: HDMI cables are still useful, but it's like I don't need that as many as I had.

851
00:58:32,117 --> 00:58:33,180
Speaker 0: I didn't need that many.

852
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,143
Speaker 1: I also finally bit the bullet.

853
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:42,860
Speaker 1: I had every combination of AV cable on earth and I did an audit of every format that's actually obsolete.

854
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,912
Speaker 1: Like I had a lot of HDMI to DVI adapters.

855
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:47,580
Speaker 1: Like that's never going to get used again in my life.

856
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:52,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had some very weird cables that like I couldn't even tell what they were for.

857
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,720
Speaker 0: And like basically I thought about my actual use cases, right?

858
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:03,400
Speaker 0: I look anytime I found the thing, I'm like, is the scenario that I'm going to actually use this, is that even like remotely likely?

859
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:10,640
Speaker 0: Like at one point, like even if it was just, you know, if it was just once, like if I could imagine like, yeah, there's going to be that one time I need this, right?

860
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,989
Speaker 0: And there's no other way for me to do the thing without this, then I kept it.

861
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,620
Speaker 0: But everything else, like, no, there's no way I would need this many HDMIs.

862
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,288
Speaker 0: There's no way I would need this specific cable, right?

863
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:23,318
Speaker 0: There's nothing I own that's going to use it, right?

864
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:23,960
Speaker 0: Get it out of here.

865
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:26,544
Speaker 0: And I had a whole bag of stuff.

866
00:59:26,925 --> 00:59:31,880
Speaker 0: And the way to prevent that is, like I said, A, give people less stuff, right?

867
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,013
Speaker 0: That way it's like if they already have a cable, then they can use it again.

868
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,960
Speaker 0: They don't, you know, got an iPhone, you got a new iPhone.

869
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,363
Speaker 0: You still got cables lying around.

870
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:41,809
Speaker 0: You don't need new ones.

871
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:46,020
Speaker 0: And people can always, if they need one, buy the one that they need, right?

872
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:49,599
Speaker 0: You know, or get a used one from someone else who has too many.

873
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,463
Speaker 0: Two standards!

874
00:59:51,803 --> 01:00:01,240
Speaker 1: Like the fact that we're forcing Apple to go to USB-C, even though they're kind of doing it in a bullshitty way, by giving us USB-C to lightning cables, which literally defeats the purpose.

875
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,021
Speaker 1: But I digress.

876
01:00:02,743 --> 01:00:03,605
Speaker 1: That is a good thing.

877
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,767
Speaker 1: Fuck that lightning cable.

878
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:11,280
Speaker 1: USB-A and USB-C should be the only cables we use, especially for power in the modern era.

879
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:16,873
Speaker 1: Maybe the third one is that regular old black cable that goes into the power supply of your computer.

880
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:19,640
Speaker 1: A lot of stuff standardized on that over the years.

881
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:20,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a lot.

882
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:26,479
Speaker 0: That was the cables that I got rid of, basically the top 15 of those, because I was always keeping them.

883
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,869
Speaker 0: I had a lot of micro and mini USB cables.

884
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,460
Speaker 0: And it's like, I have devices that use mini and micro USB still.

885
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:37,900
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to get rid of those devices because I don't want to, they still work great.

886
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:42,320
Speaker 1: I kept two of each of those cables that I still use and I already have the rest.

887
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,223
Speaker 0: But I don't need that many.

888
01:00:44,403 --> 01:00:45,325
Speaker 0: I had so many.

889
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:48,291
Speaker 0: And then I had the black standard power cables.

890
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:50,757
Speaker 0: It's like, what do I have that uses those?

891
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:52,400
Speaker 0: Like a handful of things.

892
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,103
Speaker 1: I have a lot.

893
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:55,355
Speaker 1: All the audio equipment uses those, thankfully.

894
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:56,260
Speaker 1: Like they standardize.

895
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,729
Speaker 0: But everything that you, most of the things that use them are already plugged in.

896
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:02,597
Speaker 0: So it's like, how many extras do I need?

897
01:01:02,637 --> 01:01:03,540
Speaker 0: I kept like two or three.

898
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:03,944
Speaker 0: Right.

899
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:05,260
Speaker 0: I didn't need, I had like separate.

900
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:14,840
Speaker 1: You got to have, generally a good idea is have at most of that kind of thing, the one extra that you use, like, oh, hey, I bought a new computer and I need to be able to set it up or something.

901
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:16,980
Speaker 1: And then the backup, just in case.

902
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:17,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

903
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:22,520
Speaker 0: I mean, if I buy a new computer, it's going to come with a power supply and the power supply is going to have another one of those fucking cables.

904
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,281
Speaker 0: Right.

905
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:25,388
Speaker 0: And it's like, I don't need another one of those.

906
01:01:25,408 --> 01:01:26,974
Speaker 0: You just give me the power supply only.

907
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:28,800
Speaker 0: I don't even need the internal cables.

908
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,057
Speaker 0: My old power supply had a bag of them.

909
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:31,480
Speaker 0: Right.

910
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:33,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

911
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:40,660
Speaker 1: In fact, internal power supplies, the fact that there are modular ones, we should mandate by law that power supplies like that should be modular and standardized.

912
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:44,190
Speaker 1: That way I don't even need to get more like that rat's nest of cables.

913
01:01:44,431 --> 01:01:47,700
Speaker 1: I only use three of them, two for the video card, one for the motherboard anyway.

914
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,661
Speaker 1: Yep.

915
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:49,242
Speaker 0: Exactly.

916
01:01:49,282 --> 01:01:53,688
Speaker 0: And then by the standards, if we have standards and they don't change, right.

917
01:01:53,748 --> 01:02:01,920
Speaker 0: When we change the standard from mini to micro to whatever USB, when we change the right, it's like HDMI to display ports, USB-C.

918
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,009
Speaker 0: It's like, what happens is over time, it's like I got the, you know, oh, you know what?

919
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:07,309
Speaker 0: Really?

920
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:07,870
Speaker 0: A cable.

921
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:12,980
Speaker 0: I had a lot of the, the USB, a, uh, AB ones where it's big on one end.

922
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,681
Speaker 0: Yup.

923
01:02:14,622 --> 01:02:18,728
Speaker 1: I've got a lot of A to B and A3 to B3.

924
01:02:18,749 --> 01:02:24,577
Speaker 0: The only thing I have that still uses the big one is, oh, there's two things that still use the big one.

925
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:26,060
Speaker 1: All the old hard drives I'm getting rid of.

926
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,713
Speaker 0: I have a HDMI capture card uses one and the, my scanner uses one.

927
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,940
Speaker 0: So I needed two of those and I had like 10.

928
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:42,467
Speaker 1: But there was an era where cables were changing a lot because technology was advancing rapidly.

929
01:02:42,487 --> 01:02:43,548
Speaker 1: Exactly.

930
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:56,180
Speaker 1: I would argue now we're at a point where there is a long plateau where we should standardize on, I would say very simply that big old mains power cable that goes in the back of power supplies that keep that standard.

931
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,801
Speaker 1: That's fine.

932
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:02,507
Speaker 1: The standard that take in America, that takes mains power into the little left, right?

933
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,830
Speaker 1: The little black that plugs into the back of like an anchor.

934
01:03:05,271 --> 01:03:06,052
Speaker 1: Like that's fine.

935
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:11,838
Speaker 1: USB-A to C and C to C and display port at most.

936
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,140
Speaker 1: Fuck all the other cables.

937
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,942
Speaker 0: Display port can go on USB-C now.

938
01:03:15,002 --> 01:03:15,362
Speaker 0: It could.

939
01:03:15,482 --> 01:03:18,606
Speaker 1: So we should deprecate regular old display port over time.

940
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:26,314
Speaker 1: But USB-C is a magic cable that honestly can do everything we're going to need for like a decade to come.

941
01:03:26,654 --> 01:03:31,379
Speaker 1: And if you think I'm wrong, what the fuck are you going to do that USB-C can't do?

942
01:03:31,419 --> 01:03:32,340
Speaker 1: Go read that spec.

943
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:33,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

944
01:03:33,802 --> 01:03:36,987
Speaker 0: So what, you know, unless someone invents something totally new, which hopefully they won't.

945
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:45,620
Speaker 1: And if they invent something that new and that revolutionary, then technology and society change again, just like they changed when we invented USB-C.

946
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:46,661
Speaker 0: Yep.

947
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:51,205
Speaker 0: But it's like as if we don't change standards, then people buy stuff.

948
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:51,826
Speaker 0: Right.

949
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:58,332
Speaker 0: And they can use that stuff for a long time until it actually breaks, until it's actually no longer working.

950
01:03:58,773 --> 01:03:58,973
Speaker 0: Right.

951
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:01,015
Speaker 0: And they don't then we can even start to get more.

952
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:06,060
Speaker 1: We don't need to give people more of that thing when they buy commodity equipment.

953
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

954
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:11,245
Speaker 0: You just don't have to include the, you know, we had to include the cables when you roll stuff out.

955
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:15,710
Speaker 0: But it's like, I think even at this point, it's like there's enough USB-C cables out there already.

956
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:23,820
Speaker 0: And if someone goes to a store, like if you go to the store and buy a television, I don't think it comes with an HDMI cable.

957
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,864
Speaker 1: It shouldn't go with any cables by default, I would say.

958
01:04:27,884 --> 01:04:27,984
Speaker 1: Right.

959
01:04:28,644 --> 01:04:32,688
Speaker 0: Best Buy sells HDMI cables, overpriced ones, like Monster Cable.

960
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:35,330
Speaker 0: That was a whole business, right, of selling bullshit cables.

961
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:40,415
Speaker 0: But it's like, if you've already got some, don't force some on the people.

962
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:44,578
Speaker 0: And it's not just the cables, but like, you know, I've already got SD cards.

963
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:46,600
Speaker 0: You don't need to include one with my digital camera.

964
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:56,779
Speaker 1: People, the companies do include this partly because they see it as a customer service thing, because people who buy technology often don't know a lot and they like don't know how to deal with cables.

965
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:06,740
Speaker 0: A non technology person who goes to a store and buys a camera and might be upset, like, oh, because this person in the store has now got to upsell them and all this other shit.

966
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:12,504
Speaker 1: By default, no technology comes with those commodity cables anymore.

967
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:20,771
Speaker 1: But when you buy something, kind of like how if you go to a website like Grubhub, there's a checkbox of I want plastic silverware with this order.

968
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,192
Speaker 1: You don't check it.

969
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:23,513
Speaker 1: You don't get the plastic silverware.

970
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:26,196
Speaker 1: You should have to say, I want all the cables.

971
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:29,358
Speaker 1: And if you don't want them, you don't even have to make it cheaper.

972
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,280
Speaker 1: The TV could cost the same either way.

973
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:42,520
Speaker 1: Just let me the nerd who knows I don't need the cable, not get the cable and start to teach society to keep the cables that work and not expect the new ones with everything they buy.

974
01:05:43,161 --> 01:05:55,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically all the accessories that go around a thing need to only, you know, basically should be sold and manufactured separately and distributed and reused for extended periods of time.

975
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:03,960
Speaker 0: People who buy technology don't end up with a enormous glut of just extra crap that's unnecessary that they then have to redistribute.

976
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:05,421
Speaker 1: Yep.

977
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:11,250
Speaker 1: So the moral of all this, if you got a ways one, don't buy useless shit you don't need.

978
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:17,120
Speaker 1: But if you got a bunch of it, which a lot of you probably do, especially if you're a nerd, you were hoarding it and now it's time to get rid of it.

979
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:29,380
Speaker 1: It's OK to bite that bullet and get rid of a bunch of stuff at once, because as long as you accumulated that over like the last 20 years and you're not continuing to buy useless crap from this point forward, just rip that Band-Aid off.

980
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,184
Speaker 1: You'll be happier.

981
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:33,459
Speaker 1: But two, throw it away the right way.

982
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:40,740
Speaker 1: Google, use Google and figure out how to get rid of the things you've got and follow those instructions.

983
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,519
Speaker 1: If you choose not to do that, you're a bad person.

984
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:44,542
Speaker 0: Yep.

985
01:06:45,928 --> 01:06:48,620
Speaker 0: And also your life will be so much better without all that crap line.

986
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:54,960
Speaker 1: Oh, do you know how good it felt to get rid of the gigantic cabinet that I had filled with worthless cables?

987
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:56,081
Speaker 0: Yep.

988
01:06:56,201 --> 01:07:01,695
Speaker 0: I got my whole corner of my room here on the floor that no one can see was like a big mess.

989
01:07:01,775 --> 01:07:03,680
Speaker 0: It looked like a like a rat king lived down there.

990
01:07:04,081 --> 01:07:06,300
Speaker 0: And now it's neat and tidy and I have more floor space.

991
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:11,080
Speaker 1: I threw away a lot of cables that I could not identify what they even fucking plugged into.

992
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,443
Speaker 0: I was able.

993
01:07:12,684 --> 01:07:16,380
Speaker 0: There were some close ones, but I was able to identify all of the weird ones.

994
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:20,247
Speaker 0: Some of them, some of them are going to go because I don't need them.

995
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,097
Speaker 0: And some of them got put in a bag called Weird USB.

996
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:25,100
Speaker 0: That's the name on the bag.

997
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,700
Speaker 0: Because one end is USB and the other end is what the fuck is that?

998
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,772
Speaker 1: I got one that was USB on one end and what looks like a headphone jack on the other end.

999
01:07:33,853 --> 01:07:35,156
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck that was for.

1000
01:07:35,497 --> 01:07:36,580
Speaker 1: Probably something bootleg.

1001
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:41,194
Speaker 0: One of the good ones I had was the HDMI on one end.

1002
01:07:41,214 --> 01:07:42,640
Speaker 0: and what the fuck is that on the other end?

1003
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:45,776
Speaker 0: And it was actually the tiny HDMI that goes in a GoPro.

1004
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:46,580
Speaker 0: So I saved two of them.

1005
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,061
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

1006
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:47,964
Speaker 1: Tiny HDMI.

1007
01:07:48,245 --> 01:07:50,974
Speaker 1: Also people forget there's mini display port.

1008
01:07:51,055 --> 01:07:52,600
Speaker 1: There's a lot of weird cables out there.

1009
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:52,781
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1010
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:53,569
Speaker 0: I don't have any of those.

1011
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:54,499
Speaker 0: Those are for old Macs.

1012
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:54,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1013
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:57,294
Speaker 1: I did not have a single VGA cable.

1014
01:07:57,716 --> 01:07:58,480
Speaker 1: I am proud of myself.

1015
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:04,020
Speaker 0: I have exactly one VGA and one DVI and I got rid of all the other ones a long time ago.

1016
01:08:04,362 --> 01:08:06,317
Speaker 1: I got rid of DVI and VGA too.

1017
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:06,659
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

1018
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:13,019
Speaker 0: I still have a couple things that have a VGA port on them.

1019
01:08:13,344 --> 01:08:13,938
Speaker 0: Oh, that is true.

1020
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:17,800
Speaker 0: They're not in regular use, but it could always happen.

1021
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:23,960
Speaker 1: I decided if I am in a situation where I need a VGA cable and I do not have one.

1022
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,703
Speaker 0: You can use my VGA cable.

1023
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:25,627
Speaker 0: I will lend it to you.

1024
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:27,095
Speaker 0: That will be the most eco-friendly option.

1025
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,486
Speaker 1: But let's say you got rid of it too.

1026
01:08:29,787 --> 01:08:33,040
Speaker 1: I would say that I would accept that fate.

1027
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:38,319
Speaker 1: Like a Greek hero, a Greek hero who's like, I am going to hubris against the gods.

1028
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:42,096
Speaker 1: And then when the gods strike me down, the only response is, you know what?

1029
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:42,760
Speaker 1: A hubris?

1030
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,499
Speaker 1: I welcome this lightning bolt.

1031
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,465
Speaker 0: Well actually, but that's it, right?

1032
01:08:45,505 --> 01:08:46,953
Speaker 0: So UK, you're hubris.

1033
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:48,100
Speaker 0: You need the VGA cable.

1034
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:50,535
Speaker 0: You don't know me and I don't, you can't get mine.

1035
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:51,300
Speaker 0: Guess what?

1036
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,859
Speaker 0: You're going to find someone else in the neighborhood who's got one.

1037
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:55,282
Speaker 1: Yep.

1038
01:08:55,527 --> 01:08:56,220
Speaker 1: And if you're at a convention.

1039
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,679
Speaker 0: You could be on the receiving end of helping someone out.

1040
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:01,729
Speaker 0: Do you need a 200 megabyte hard drive?

1041
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:05,540
Speaker 0: You could find someone who's just going to give you one for free.

1042
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,897
Speaker 0: Go on your Craigslist or your Facebook marketplace or your local, whatever.

1043
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:09,439
Speaker 0: Right?

1044
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,678
Speaker 0: Don't go buy one.

1045
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:11,764
Speaker 0: I found a one.

1046
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:14,120
Speaker 1: I found a, uh, a 500.

1047
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,698
Speaker 0: That would be a fun, this, I guess this, this would be really fun.

1048
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:31,399
Speaker 0: How many getting, if you only collected free stuff from people where you live, how many, regardless of performance or quality, how many functioning computers could you construct with free stuff from the neighborhood?

1049
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:32,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1050
01:09:32,261 --> 01:09:33,408
Speaker 1: Pick some minimum line.

1051
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,560
Speaker 1: Like could it launch a web browser?

1052
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,337
Speaker 0: Can you install a Linux distribution and boot it?

1053
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:38,960
Speaker 1: Yep.

1054
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:42,639
Speaker 0: Can you boot a Linux period by any means?

1055
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,859
Speaker 1: I think I could build a couple of computers just out of shit laying around the house, to be honest.

1056
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:48,184
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1057
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,040
Speaker 0: I don't have any egg motherboards lying around.

1058
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,080
Speaker 1: I did get rid of some motherboards that I had.

1059
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:53,738
Speaker 0: I don't have any.

1060
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,126
Speaker 1: I'm down to.

1061
01:09:55,528 --> 01:09:58,380
Speaker 1: every motherboard I got is in a computer and currently powered.

1062
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,850
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1063
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:11,970
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1065
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,310
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1066
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:25,050
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1068
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:32,870
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1069
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,010
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1070
01:10:36,451 --> 01:10:42,002
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this specific episode of Geek Nights, which was a long one because that's what happens anytime.

1071
01:10:42,022 --> 01:11:01,323
Speaker 1: Scott and I don't do a show for a little while, are Alan Joyce, Linki G, Dread, Lily, Tenebrae, Case, Care, Makes Music, Chris, Hadad, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Haze, Penny Reimer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl, and many, many people who give less than five dollars a month.

1072
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:09,970
Speaker 1: because while I won't say your name, your support is appreciated and you get access to all those custom RSS feeds and other nonsense without having to pay more than a dollar a month.

1073
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:20,909
Speaker 1: But anyway, tonight, first what I'll tell you is Scott and I were talking about doing a panel at Zenkai Con Online, and Scott wasn't super-feeling it, so I just recorded the whole thing on my own.

1074
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:31,630
Speaker 1: So it'll be on YouTube at some point, but it'll be premiered at Zenkai Con Online, and it's just a panel about what goes on behind the scenes at cons.

1075
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:37,070
Speaker 1: And I have a call to action, so I'm going to post a link in the description of this episode.

1076
01:11:37,852 --> 01:11:52,370
Speaker 1: If you do anything at conventions other than attending or being in the artist alley, I say we don't care about the artist alley because people have talked about that artist alley to death, like there's no new stories there.

1077
01:11:52,910 --> 01:12:04,890
Speaker 1: If you do anything else for a convention, like you're staff, you're a janitor, you work in a hotel, you're like event staff, you're the cop who has to stand outside of cons, we want to hear from you.

1078
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:13,970
Speaker 1: I've got a link to a survey, we are real interested in what it's like for you, or the people who do those kinds of jobs, when nerd conventions are happening.

1079
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,205
Speaker 1: But beyond that, I simply leave you right now with...

1080
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:27,760
Speaker 0: Bum bum bum, ba dum ba dum, a duck walked up to a lemonade stand, and he said to the man running the stand, "Well Seymour, I made it, despite your

1081
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,322
Speaker 0: directions.".

1082
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:32,617
Speaker 1: The man said, "Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome.

1083
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:34,726
Speaker 1: I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable

1084
01:12:34,746 --> 01:12:34,987
Speaker 1: luncheon.".

1085
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,288
Speaker 1: The duck said,

1086
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:38,093
Speaker 1: "Eh.".

1087
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:49,310
Speaker 1: Then he waddled away, waddle waddle, 'til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum bum bum, when the duck walked up to the lemonade stand, and he said to the man running the stand,

1088
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:50,673
Speaker 1: "Seymour!".

1089
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:52,310
Speaker 1: Bum bum bum.

1090
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,501
Speaker 1: "Why is there smoke coming out of your oven,

1091
01:12:54,521 --> 01:12:54,863
Speaker 1: Seymour?".

1092
01:12:56,823 --> 01:13:01,782
Speaker 0: The man said, "Oh, that isn't smoke, it's steam, steam from the steamed clams we're having.

1093
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:03,186
Speaker 0: Mmm, steamed

1094
01:13:03,206 --> 01:13:03,587
Speaker 0: clams.".

1095
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:05,429
Speaker 1: The duck said,

1096
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:06,951
Speaker 1: "Eh.".

1097
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:18,250
Speaker 1: Then he waddled away, waddle waddle, then he waddled away, waddle waddle, then he waddled away, waddle waddle, 'til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum bum...
