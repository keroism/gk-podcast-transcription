1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,127
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Thursday, May 6th.

2
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:11,949
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,376
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:17,439
Speaker 1: I crab people time travel.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:27,943
Speaker 1: So uh hey Scott.

7
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:29,107
Speaker 1: What's the Grecian urn?

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,279
Speaker 1: an amphora about 25 cents an hour these days oh?

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,055
Speaker 0: Do they really cuz?

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:41,000
Speaker 1: I mean That was just a FARC headline, and you know the radio DJ thing to do is to steal ahead.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,786
Speaker 1: I mean just.

12
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:42,370
Speaker 0: I mean just cuz.

13
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,620
Speaker 0: they have economics problems.

14
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:46,571
Speaker 0: I don't think that they're like their wages are the problem.

15
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,879
Speaker 0: I think that the government is the problem right.

16
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,289
Speaker 0: well It's got too much debt.

17
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,760
Speaker 0: It's got not enough tax revenue.

18
00:00:52,081 --> 00:01:00,940
Speaker 1: It's well the problems complicated, but what I would boil it down to and I'm by no means you know Wall Street job aside I'm by no means a professional you make sure that our kids yeah, okay?

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,240
Speaker 0: You learn a lot about this stuff just being around people who do it, but your job is make sure the server doesn't crash.

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,732
Speaker 1: Well actually no I have much bigger responsibilities than that now.

21
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:11,378
Speaker 1: I got promoted a while ago.

22
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:11,940
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

23
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,760
Speaker 0: So now you have to make sure two servers.

24
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:24,839
Speaker 1: But all that aside I mean what that situation basically comes down to is that Imagine you know our got like New York State the government again run out of money and budgets not done.

25
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:31,873
Speaker 1: So you know it periodically in America will have things shut down like we're out of money We're shutting everything down, but well that's no.

26
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:36,008
Speaker 0: usually things shut down When states can't pass their budgets.

27
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,833
Speaker 0: so the state doesn't pass a budget.

28
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:43,511
Speaker 0: the date goes past the deadline is gone And now they you know they can't allocate money to anything so they turn.

29
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,497
Speaker 0: so everyone goes home and know what.

30
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:48,380
Speaker 0: they can't spend any Money on anything except emergency service.

31
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:53,410
Speaker 1: I guess the point I was making that at least when I was a kid this happened in Michigan a few times But they never actually shut anything down.

32
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,345
Speaker 1: basically the state's out of money And it didn't mean anything.

33
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:01,706
Speaker 1: and part of the reason why it doesn't mean anything is that with credit We can do deficit spending.

34
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:07,019
Speaker 1: so if there is a problem you can always just spend the money and deal with it later And that works pretty well.

35
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:22,862
Speaker 1: But imagine if one day the felt like if tomorrow the federal government was told by Someone who had the power to tell them things you can't borrow any money for the next few years Starting right now, so we had to then pay for everything we did with cash Mmm.

36
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,330
Speaker 1: We don't have enough cash, so what do we do?

37
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,015
Speaker 0: you don't get everything you want.

38
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:28,820
Speaker 1: so the real tricky part?

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,747
Speaker 1: Is that in Greece basically?

40
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:36,866
Speaker 1: It's kind of a situation of the ant in the grasshopper where Germany You know the old parable.

41
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:41,060
Speaker 1: no, okay, never mind, then this doesn't work obviously the analogy.

42
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:43,119
Speaker 1: But so it's the line in the mouse.

43
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:48,400
Speaker 0: He's pulled the thorn out of his the hobo and the guy who is fiscally responsible.

44
00:02:50,521 --> 00:03:03,710
Speaker 1: The hobo begs on the street and the fiscally responsible guy goes home and plays some video games, but basically today I you know I saw you guys playing that stock market game and someone was like oh Greece passed the thing and now the stock market collapsed.

45
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,477
Speaker 1: that is so far from the truth.

46
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:08,314
Speaker 1: so already There's riots going on in the street in Greece.

47
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:16,890
Speaker 0: I mean you know we have Yeah, well You know we always talk about how the reason we can't get anyone to riot is because this bread and as long as they have Bread and circuses guess what Greece no more bread.

48
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:17,612
Speaker 1: well.

49
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:18,757
Speaker 1: They're running out of circuses too.

50
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,868
Speaker 0: if that pool thing Oh, well, no they got plenty of circuses.

51
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:26,506
Speaker 1: They're not enough pools bread circuses and pools apparently plus You know World Cup's coming.

52
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:29,120
Speaker 0: That's plenty of circuses for them unless they lose.

53
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:34,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know it doesn't matter, but Basically, it was sad.

54
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:39,320
Speaker 1: I mean it's one thing to work in the financial sector It's another thing to see the kind of visceral.

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,541
Speaker 1: You know.

56
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:44,080
Speaker 1: people died in Greece in riots and attacks on banks because of the economic situation.

57
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:49,025
Speaker 1: My opinions and all that aside The stock market dropped.

58
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:53,260
Speaker 1: the Dow at least dropped nine hundred and something points in the course of like a minute.

59
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:54,999
Speaker 1: Yep, so I'm sitting at work.

60
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,860
Speaker 1: You know things are going pretty pretty fine.

61
00:03:57,262 --> 00:04:02,829
Speaker 1: And then I see a little news thing pops up that says Greece passes austerity bill, and I'm like huh I wonder how that's going to affect the.

62
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:14,065
Speaker 1: and then I look up and I see Interspersed with CNBC saying like stock market collapsing oh my god, and they're like they're all panicking and Interspersed with this.

63
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:17,279
Speaker 1: in the background is scenes of further rioting in Greece.

64
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:21,820
Speaker 1: And then I look at all my market days exploding like the book like froze on my laptop.

65
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:25,080
Speaker 1: I could I couldn't even like see what was going on in the market.

66
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,120
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to like make sure all our systems are handling this okay.

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,536
Speaker 1: And and the markets dropping faster than the news can even report I see the news saying like it's dropped 400 points, and I'm looking at the real market data.

68
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:35,898
Speaker 0: It's like -800.

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,508
Speaker 1: It's like an 800 and still going down.

70
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,315
Speaker 1: We almost did the circuit breaker.

71
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 0: What's the circuit breaker?

72
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:49,999
Speaker 1: There's a circuit breaker in the stock market that basically says if you drop more than X percent and all these other conditions Markets stop because we got to figure out what's going on.

73
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,100
Speaker 1: We got kind of close to that mmm, but Basically what happened now?

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,542
Speaker 1: This is all up in the air And this is not.

75
00:04:57,623 --> 00:05:06,420
Speaker 1: I don't speak on behalf of any company of any entity other than myself and my personal Guess and opinion and CNBC is actually reported something similar.

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,249
Speaker 1: But it may well have been that basically there was a prince that when someone ever you buy stock There's a print in the tape.

77
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,526
Speaker 1: you know the ticker tape Still exists somewhere.

78
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,940
Speaker 1: yeah, but no one has a physical tip ticker tape okay?

79
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,400
Speaker 1: I found on Craigslist a ticker tape machine.

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,420
Speaker 0: Could you hook it up and make it print out what it's supposed to print out for reals probably?

81
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,702
Speaker 1: There might.

82
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:32,540
Speaker 1: it might print too fast it might break But I thought about buying it when you're in beacon because it was in the city.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,406
Speaker 1: I could see if it's still there.

84
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,299
Speaker 1: imagine if we had a ticker tape machine.

85
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,043
Speaker 0: That's all.

86
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,710
Speaker 1: you hook it up to the Arduino.

87
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,654
Speaker 0: That's all you.

88
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:38,754
Speaker 0: yeah.

89
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:50,308
Speaker 1: anyway as Best as anyone on CNBC has been able to report it was basically a glitch and what happened was somewhere along the line Internet saying it wasn't a glitch though.

90
00:05:50,348 --> 00:06:01,820
Speaker 1: well not a glitch in like the stock market or in the systems But there was some sort of print that was way outside of what anyone would have expected and because of that You know people treated it as legitimate.

91
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:12,475
Speaker 1: And it's possible that automatic systems and then humans in that fraction of a second made very poor decisions Because of that and started selling when they probably wouldn't have wanted to sell.

92
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:18,504
Speaker 1: so the market dropped 900 points then immediately went all the way back up as everyone you know rebought in or fixed everything and There were.

93
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:19,609
Speaker 1: it was crazy.

94
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:20,231
Speaker 1: I'm sitting there.

95
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,115
Speaker 1: Everyone's panicking.

96
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:24,528
Speaker 1: There's yelling going around There's yelling on the TV and on the TV.

97
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:27,740
Speaker 1: behind the yelling is riots and fireballs and riot police in the streets.

98
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,692
Speaker 0: It's awesome that thing is right.

99
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:31,817
Speaker 0: so that all happened to me.

100
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:41,540
Speaker 1: all this happens And then you know finally it's starting to calm down And I look in the geek nights forum And I see one of you guys playing that game basically like I think the stock markets going down.

101
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:43,999
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I wonder if it was because of Greece.

102
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:51,120
Speaker 0: But meanwhile right it's like all that crazy shit happens, but it's like yeah, son is sons up right.

103
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:51,903
Speaker 0: I mean like.

104
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:54,474
Speaker 0: you know everyone's driving around got biked home.

105
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,940
Speaker 1: Well people are driving around here.

106
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:56,727
Speaker 1: I mean Greece.

107
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:57,615
Speaker 1: things aren't doing so.

108
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:03,140
Speaker 0: well no But I mean it's like how can you tell that if that's happens, and it's not like the end?

109
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,192
Speaker 0: How can you tell when it's the end?

110
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:06,198
Speaker 1: well cuz it went back up?

111
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,494
Speaker 0: Okay, so wait so what if it's the circuit breaker right?

112
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,680
Speaker 0: so basically the market closes.

113
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:17,760
Speaker 0: The same is like the bell ringing right kind of yeah, so do all the exchanges of the same circuit breaker?

114
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,465
Speaker 1: That I'm not 100% sure on.

115
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:21,955
Speaker 1: basically you know as it was dropping.

116
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:22,357
Speaker 1: I'm talking.

117
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:23,060
Speaker 1: look at my co-workers.

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,803
Speaker 1: We're debating.

119
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:27,777
Speaker 1: so if the circuit breaker is hit how exactly should we handle this and do it this way?

120
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:28,420
Speaker 1: do it this way?

121
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,737
Speaker 0: Cuz you get to go home right I mean the market closes.

122
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:31,040
Speaker 0: go home.

123
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,973
Speaker 1: As much as I wish I would be the one to be there to deal with that bullshit.

124
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:35,415
Speaker 1: right.

125
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:36,540
Speaker 0: so the thing is right.

126
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,619
Speaker 0: Okay, so let's say hit the circuit breaker and the next day you open the market again.

127
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:45,780
Speaker 1: The idea is that something's going on and it's probably not good.

128
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,911
Speaker 1: So let's stop and give everyone time to cool down to assess.

129
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:59,198
Speaker 0: basically give everyone time to Scott Johnson it in a choir And count what if everyone counts all the ducks and there's like five ducks And there's supposed to be five million does well.

130
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,479
Speaker 1: Then the market has discovered a problem and now we got to deal with that.

131
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:04,688
Speaker 1: I mean if you only what?

132
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,880
Speaker 0: if the only answer is it's it's gonna go down like all the way.

133
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:13,427
Speaker 1: Actually had five ducks in the first place, and you've been just Acting like you had more ducks all this time.

134
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,755
Speaker 0: isn't that what the whole world's been doing for?

135
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,879
Speaker 0: you know a hundred years?

136
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,659
Speaker 1: It's a little more complicated than that.

137
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,388
Speaker 0: I don't know what it seems like to me.

138
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,719
Speaker 1: the gist of this is I had an exciting day at work.

139
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,666
Speaker 0: All right I got nothing Thursday.

140
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,396
Speaker 1: We couldn't decide what to do the show on even.

141
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,533
Speaker 1: yeah It's got a good idea, and we'll probably do it in the future.

142
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:34,760
Speaker 1: should we tell him what this idea?

143
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,842
Speaker 0: Necessary?

144
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:38,100
Speaker 1: you don't want to keep it a secret cuz I think it'll be a secret.

145
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:39,344
Speaker 0: We don't need to.

146
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:44,920
Speaker 0: you know we never really talk about shows in advance plus when I do right it could result in shit talking.

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,863
Speaker 0: So let's not it could.

148
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:51,383
Speaker 1: but unless we always preface things by saying we may we might we intend yeah It's not necessary.

149
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,630
Speaker 1: We desire to anyway.

150
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:54,794
Speaker 1: There is a news.

151
00:08:54,834 --> 00:09:01,840
Speaker 1: I want to talk about really yeah I don't want to talk about it a lot, but I want to take this not from the technological side.

152
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,515
Speaker 1: I mean this is basically a Monday style news that there's an.

153
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:06,700
Speaker 1: so here's the deal.

154
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:21,862
Speaker 1: We have brain scan machines now that can detect fairly accurately whether or not someone is lying on the spot Like it can tell with a reasonable degree of certainty whether or not a person is fabricating the verbal data that they're expelling To you.

155
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:22,866
Speaker 1: mm-hmm now.

156
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:23,689
Speaker 1: It's not perfect yet.

157
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:26,480
Speaker 1: We shouldn't use this in courts because it's like lie detectors.

158
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:27,470
Speaker 1: It's still it's not.

159
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:30,744
Speaker 1: we can't Can't send someone.

160
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:34,776
Speaker 0: you can't lock someone up forever based on what a machine says it's not it's not cool.

161
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:42,057
Speaker 1: Well well well So what if we have a machine that recorded video of a dude stabbing another dude to death?

162
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:42,940
Speaker 0: that's okay?

163
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,339
Speaker 1: But that's just a machine telling us something?

164
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:46,946
Speaker 0: Not really.

165
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,010
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

166
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:48,814
Speaker 1: What's different?

167
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:49,978
Speaker 0: What's different?

168
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,280
Speaker 1: Yeah?

169
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,874
Speaker 0: Because even though we have fmri's and stuff.

170
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,105
Speaker 0: That's not.

171
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,542
Speaker 0: you know people's brains Right?

172
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:57,926
Speaker 0: are not video cameras?

173
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:00,834
Speaker 0: video cameras are infallible a brain recording memory.

174
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:06,460
Speaker 0: even if you can read the memory out of the brain It's not exactly what the person reading the memory.

175
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,139
Speaker 1: Well, this is the very specific case here is the idea that what if you can tell?

176
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:17,067
Speaker 1: 100% whether or not a person right now is Fabricating what they're telling to you?

177
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:17,810
Speaker 0: what?

178
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,895
Speaker 0: but here's the thing right.

179
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:19,940
Speaker 0: is it the same?

180
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:22,711
Speaker 0: What if I think I'm lying, but I'm not?

181
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,258
Speaker 0: what does it still look the same?

182
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:29,133
Speaker 1: well If you think you're lying And you're not then that means that you your intent is still to lie.

183
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,060
Speaker 1: you just happen to have accidentally told the truth.

184
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:33,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now you're gonna now.

185
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:33,914
Speaker 0: What do you know?

186
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:34,939
Speaker 0: You don't know what to think right.

187
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,137
Speaker 1: so well But what if you could have a meter that basically says this person is guaranteed?

188
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:42,649
Speaker 1: right now We can prove with science is in whatever.

189
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:45,557
Speaker 1: He is saying he is intending to deceive what.

190
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:45,898
Speaker 0: how am I?

191
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:46,460
Speaker 0: what percentage?

192
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,985
Speaker 0: 100?

193
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,213
Speaker 1: let's say we get a hundred somehow.

194
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:52,440
Speaker 1: It's a hundred Let's just say for the purpose of a thought experiment.

195
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:54,429
Speaker 0: So you know that they're intending to deceive.

196
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,121
Speaker 0: you still have no idea what the truth is you haven't learned anything But you.

197
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,288
Speaker 1: but is it admissible?

198
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,540
Speaker 1: you would you say in a court if someone is?

199
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:10,154
Speaker 1: testifying like right now before Congress or before a court they're testifying and This machine says 100% the last two sentences that they spoke.

200
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:15,599
Speaker 1: regardless of the veracity of these sentences Were spoken with the clear intent to deceive the listeners.

201
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,180
Speaker 0: well You you couldn't say for sure whether those two sentences are true or false.

202
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,961
Speaker 0: But what you could do is you could just I could just strike those two sentences from the record and then leave it at That.

203
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:27,360
Speaker 0: so he'd be like okay those two sentences are not admissible in the court.

204
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,264
Speaker 0: And so here's the.

205
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:34,527
Speaker 1: here's the interesting thing that happened a judge in Brooklyn has excluded FMR eyes from trials.

206
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:38,559
Speaker 1: okay now it did not set a precedent because the way he did it.

207
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:45,847
Speaker 1: But all that aside the interesting part is that he did not argue that it wasn't accurate enough or that it's Ambiguous or anything like that.

208
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:48,318
Speaker 1: You know this is the conversation we could argue about forever mm-hmm.

209
00:11:49,142 --> 00:12:01,978
Speaker 1: The reason he didn't let it go is quote Juries are supposed to decide the credibility of witnesses and fMRI lie detection even if it could be proven completely accurate infringes on that right.

210
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:05,720
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I don't know how I feel about that at all.

211
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,132
Speaker 1: I don't know the idea that you're saying that that the the jury were.

212
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:16,640
Speaker 1: if we have a machine that can determine an actual truth Verifiably, and he you know he said you know irrespective.

213
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,284
Speaker 0: Oh isn't?

214
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:20,140
Speaker 0: the purpose of the jury is because we can't find the truth.

215
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,180
Speaker 0: So we need a jury of peers to you know discover it.

216
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,775
Speaker 0: But what if there is a way to beyond reasonable doubt just scientifically determine the truth?

217
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:40,293
Speaker 0: for reals like let's say we have you know Magic Oracle that actually works and let us look at any you know or a quantum wormhole that a machine that lets us watch the past Yes, or watch exactly the word someone's thinking in their head.

218
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:41,980
Speaker 1: You know crazy future tired science.

219
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, then what do you need a jury for?

220
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:44,498
Speaker 0: it's you don't need one.

221
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:48,496
Speaker 1: well I think you still need a jury to look at that evidence, and you know I don't know.

222
00:12:48,536 --> 00:13:05,040
Speaker 1: I feel like The idea of a jury of peers is still important in the idea that even if we're in some far-future society if we ever use Machines that are above beyond us or before us you know in terms of an AI That's smarter than us or a machine that's not as smart as us or smart in a different way.

223
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:12,000
Speaker 1: I feel like at least one other of us has to agree with what the machine did before we decide to enact justice.

224
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:17,262
Speaker 0: The thing is that the machine can Do that.

225
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:22,900
Speaker 0: the machine can also probably control the person that is that the person that's supposed to agree with it.

226
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:28,556
Speaker 1: It's interesting that this judge is basically sidestepped all the practical arguments of.

227
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,000
Speaker 1: well is it really accurate?

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,199
Speaker 1: What does it really tell us and said straight up?

229
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,660
Speaker 1: We shouldn't use machines like this because it infringes on the jury's rights to figure it out for themselves.

230
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,106
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, I don't know.

231
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:40,892
Speaker 1: I think it's interesting, and I don't know how I feel about.

232
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,840
Speaker 0: there was an interesting thing that I read about.

233
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:44,184
Speaker 0: They did something.

234
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:48,800
Speaker 0: I don't know where it was, but basically they compared rational jurists to non rational juries.

235
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:58,099
Speaker 0: I don't know how they determined who was a rational person And who wasn't but apparently rational people decide cases rationally gasp and non-rational people decide case.

236
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:01,967
Speaker 1: was that emotionally Where they showed that?

237
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:09,078
Speaker 1: because they segregated jurors again between emotional and rational and they found that but overwhelmingly so.

238
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:15,435
Speaker 1: irrational or emotional jurors Would pretty much say guilty or innocent based on how attractive the person was.

239
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:16,900
Speaker 0: yeah, I think that was the article there.

240
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so it's like.

241
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:22,510
Speaker 0: so they were like look we have to only have rational jurors, so it's like aha You'll have no jurors.

242
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:23,035
Speaker 1: Well.

243
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:29,076
Speaker 1: You know the old Everybody was that the judge said to the to the lawyers who didn't know who James James Randy was.

244
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:35,899
Speaker 1: he said that man there Will evaluate the facts in an empirical manner and make a decision based solely on the veracity of the whatever.

245
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,934
Speaker 0: yep Hell no.

246
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,379
Speaker 0: And then he was not on the jury.

247
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,724
Speaker 0: So yeah, but I think this was in a non-us Situation.

248
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:52,700
Speaker 0: I think it might have been in Ireland or the UK or something I mean, I think in the end Scotland my personal.

249
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,040
Speaker 1: You know it's Thursday.

250
00:14:54,101 --> 00:15:00,100
Speaker 1: I don't really want to get in the news any further But I'm of the mind that regardless of how we define in law like what?

251
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,696
Speaker 1: Pardon me what the purposes of juries are with the purpose of law is what justice is I?

252
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:21,483
Speaker 1: Feel like there should be a stated goal in all in our entire legal system that Basically forces everyone to accept truth above all other circumstances Like if something can be proven like proven beyond a beyond any Already

253
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,271
Speaker 0: have that it's called beyond a reasonable doubt

254
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:27,180
Speaker 1: well beyond a reasonable doubt or beyond a shadow of a doubt.

255
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:34,479
Speaker 0: Well beyond a shadow of a doubt is is also beyond a reasonable that actually multiple lawyers have told me that those are actually two different circumstances.

256
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:50,537
Speaker 1: That beyond a reasonable doubt is for example Yeah It's possible that you didn't do it if there is a DNA clone of you out there that was taken from you know When you were born grown in a lab trained and dropped from the sky into this facility.

257
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:51,360
Speaker 1: You know something like that.

258
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:52,986
Speaker 1: That's not a reasonable doubt.

259
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:56,139
Speaker 1: No, but shadow of a doubt is that's also not possible.

260
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:00,281
Speaker 1: Okay, I Don't know.

261
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,024
Speaker 1: I thought it was interesting.

262
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,188
Speaker 1: Do you have anything interesting?

263
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,052
Speaker 0: No nothing.

264
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:06,985
Speaker 1: on this Thursday this fine summer day It's not summer yet.

265
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:07,829
Speaker 0: It's summer.

266
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,231
Speaker 0: No.

267
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,798
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's like 80 degrees out there.

268
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:10,140
Speaker 1: It's summer.

269
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,164
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's spring.

270
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,293
Speaker 0: still the leaves are summer green.

271
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,883
Speaker 1: They're no longer spring green I don't know.

272
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:16,586
Speaker 0: I went to work.

273
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,476
Speaker 0: He came home playing the Street Fighter.

274
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:23,349
Speaker 1: You know I Almost bought an X any second.

275
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:26,895
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna go up buy an Xbox and then you get regret it You don't have a street fight.

276
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:27,843
Speaker 0: Maybe you should.

277
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,228
Speaker 0: maybe you should play some Street Fighter.

278
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:29,810
Speaker 0: to decide.

279
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:40,564
Speaker 1: I was I was playing some Street Fighter last night at the music Super Street Fighter for yeah, and he's well with actually a bigger stick from the one you had Conrad brought.

280
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:46,240
Speaker 0: he probably I think he has like a like a hori stick, so I kicked some ass.

281
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:49,179
Speaker 1: Yeah against two against people who sucked.

282
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:57,285
Speaker 1: Basically I used my Street Fighter 2 non pre gnosis skills so my completely non Gnostic.

283
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,120
Speaker 0: all your Street Fighter 2 stuff still works.

284
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,180
Speaker 0: There's just a whole bunch of extra stuff on top of it.

285
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,240
Speaker 0: But any character from Street Fighter 2 you could just play as if it's Street Fighter 2.

286
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:14,819
Speaker 0: I actually wish they would include like Street Fighter 2 mode where you can only use Street Fighter 2 characters And they work exactly the way they worked in Street Fighter 2 or at least Super Street Fighter 2 turbo.

287
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, because every character from Super Street Fighter 2 turbo is in there.

288
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:28,099
Speaker 1: So against people who also do not know the gnosis and also who didn't really play Street Fighter back in the day I can just M bison and just slide kick slide kick slide kick slide kick slide kick slide kick until they die.

289
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,924
Speaker 0: Yeah, the slide kick.

290
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:32,180
Speaker 0: if a super day play I play as M bison all the time.

291
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,461
Speaker 0: That's my.

292
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:34,593
Speaker 1: I played one good person, and I was like slide kick.

293
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:35,518
Speaker 1: He's like punch to the nuts.

294
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:35,819
Speaker 1: You're done.

295
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,705
Speaker 1: Yeah I should not decide to slide.

296
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:41,760
Speaker 0: kick is basically the least safe move in the that you can possibly do as M bison.

297
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,719
Speaker 0: But you basically they can block it low and then start a combo on you.

298
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can do an uppercut against even though you're low.

299
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,440
Speaker 0: They can basically hit jump and hit you while you're doing it and then start a combo.

300
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:57,860
Speaker 0: They can block it with a focus attack and then crumple you and then make a combo.

301
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,940
Speaker 0: It's basically the weakest most unsafe possible move you can do is the slide, you know.

302
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:12,720
Speaker 0: And I only throw out the slide when it's like completely Completely safe to do the slide and there's absolutely no chance and it's so rare that that happens.

303
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:16,760
Speaker 0: The thing is I have a reflex to do the slide when I shouldn't or accidentally do the slide.

304
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,780
Speaker 0: So I got it like avoid the slide basic, you know.

305
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,480
Speaker 0: And it's sort of annoying too because your M bison you want to do a low kick.

306
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:30,419
Speaker 0: You got to do the low medium kick Which is great because there's a great reach on it and also the standing medium kick has a great forward reach, you know.

307
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:41,620
Speaker 0: But if you accidentally push the other way you do the stupid slide you know like ah fuck and then the guy blocks it and show you can do and then you land on the ground and you Stand up and he gets you when you're trying to stand up and then it's a disaster.

308
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,552
Speaker 1: So anyway, we got nothing on this Thursday day.

309
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:55,088
Speaker 0: So things of the day Mmm thing of the day.

310
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,175
Speaker 0: All right, so check this out.

311
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:56,497
Speaker 0: You're ready.

312
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:56,900
Speaker 0: I'm checkin.

313
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,164
Speaker 0: Einfish.

314
00:18:59,184 --> 00:18:59,909
Speaker 0: it's very fish.

315
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:02,617
Speaker 0: right to fish Blair fish.

316
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,570
Speaker 1: One fish to fish red fish blue fish.

317
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:11,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently this is a Yiddish Translation of one fish to fish red fish blue fish.

318
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,334
Speaker 0: What gets better than that, right?

319
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,023
Speaker 0: I mean Yiddish is awesome But this is like dr.

320
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:15,986
Speaker 0: Seuss Yiddish.

321
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:17,230
Speaker 0: I don't know.

322
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,474
Speaker 0: Can you can you really beat that?

323
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,200
Speaker 0: I don't think you can beat that.

324
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:24,474
Speaker 1: I think I can beat that with the fact that we can now watch the original metropolis uncut.

325
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:25,517
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

326
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:26,099
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

327
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,079
Speaker 1: indeed Apparently guy had it for a long time.

328
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,939
Speaker 1: You know, everyone probably knows the whole story of metropolis.

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,380
Speaker 1: now We lost it and you know It was really was shown and people hated it because it was too like obtuse.

330
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,039
Speaker 1: so they cut out huge chunks of the movie and then they were lost and destroyed.

331
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,328
Speaker 1: and Basically, they're shown in theaters now.

332
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:44,910
Speaker 1: They found it.

333
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,874
Speaker 1: They've got the whole thing.

334
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,160
Speaker 1: It'll be on DVD soon.

335
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,993
Speaker 1: I'm gonna find out where it's playing in New York City and maybe we'll go see it though.

336
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:52,397
Speaker 1: It's like three hours long.

337
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:56,587
Speaker 1: That's fun but Cool things to note one.

338
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,580
Speaker 1: There's an entire like subplot.

339
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:05,560
Speaker 1: Well, actually there's multiple subplots that were completely cut out Involving the Thin Man and he looks pretty good in these shots.

340
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,225
Speaker 0: Why should we go to see this?

341
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:11,860
Speaker 0: and it's just rent arrows and you know the most metropolis.

342
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:14,577
Speaker 0: It's like no you didn't.

343
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:24,984
Speaker 1: Well the really interesting thing is that I'm gonna quote one of the guys who restored it and who worked with this project a lot who has seen all the real metropolis now Quote.

344
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,125
Speaker 1: it is no longer a science fiction film Mm-hmm.

345
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,800
Speaker 1: The balance of the story has been given back.

346
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,020
Speaker 1: It's now a film that encompasses many many genres an epic about conflicts that are ages old.

347
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,951
Speaker 1: The science fiction disguise is now very very thin.

348
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:38,773
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

349
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,240
Speaker 1: I really look forward to seeing this.

350
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:45,913
Speaker 0: Have you watched any other Fritz Lang movies like M or anything like that?

351
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:46,635
Speaker 1: I've seen em.

352
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:47,658
Speaker 0: Ah, so great.

353
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,327
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, all right.

354
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:53,156
Speaker 1: So the meta minute that you forgot about.

355
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:53,678
Speaker 0: Oh snap.

356
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,728
Speaker 1: Oh Cosmos is the book project.

357
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,297
Speaker 1: Dorf is the coding club project.

358
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:02,429
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know don't have much else.

359
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,919
Speaker 0: Kinetic on is coming kinetic on is coming up.

360
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,747
Speaker 1: But if you really want to do a panel you better get it to me like today or tomorrow Because I'm not really taking any more submissions.

361
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:11,249
Speaker 0: No, I don't know.

362
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,535
Speaker 0: do we have enough to fill the schedule?

363
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:13,197
Speaker 1: I think so.

364
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:17,625
Speaker 0: All right I don't know.

365
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,615
Speaker 0: I don't have any more metas nothing at all.

366
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:25,676
Speaker 0: No Okay, so we couldn't think of an idea for the show.

367
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:26,359
Speaker 0: so we went.

368
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:28,520
Speaker 0: actually Emily will be happy.

369
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:37,160
Speaker 0: She made like a spreadsheet on Google Docs or a document on Google Docs that has Basically, she compiled all the suggestions from the forum thread into one document.

370
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,613
Speaker 0: So I actually looked at it for once and I'm like boring boring boring.

371
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,960
Speaker 0: and then I see this one suggestion for time travel.

372
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,359
Speaker 0: And I'm like, huh?

373
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:47,185
Speaker 0: You know, there was that reason.

374
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:49,492
Speaker 0: Stephen Hawking thing about time travel.

375
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:51,960
Speaker 0: Maybe this will be an okay show.

376
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,027
Speaker 0: So, let's see.

377
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:53,329
Speaker 0: What's up?

378
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,074
Speaker 1: I'll go straight up.

379
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:59,954
Speaker 1: I have a prediction about why He is saying the things he's saying now suddenly cuz.

380
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:04,460
Speaker 1: remember just a little while ago We came out and he was like, yeah, if aliens find us, they'll probably kill us.

381
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,619
Speaker 1: We should really be hiding until we're more advanced.

382
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:20,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably cuz anyway, I think the thing is is that if you're in a situation right where you cannot achieve interstellar travel and There are any alien for any aliens to meet you.

383
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,775
Speaker 0: They do know interstellar travel.

384
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:23,500
Speaker 0: therefore, right?

385
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:27,200
Speaker 0: They are automatically guaranteed to be more advanced than you.

386
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:35,360
Speaker 0: But if you have interstellar travel, then you don't really have any other measurement You know to determine if aliens are more or less advanced than you are until you meet them.

387
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,500
Speaker 0: So until you are able to meet aliens, you should not encourage aliens to meet you.

388
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,668
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you're guaranteed to have the lower hand.

389
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:43,592
Speaker 1: now at the same time.

390
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:47,105
Speaker 1: He's definitely relying in this case on Human experience.

391
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,571
Speaker 1: I mean uses the Christopher Columbus.

392
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:49,294
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

393
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:49,877
Speaker 0: Everyone has.

394
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:52,046
Speaker 1: well We got you know, we're this.

395
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:54,737
Speaker 1: this puddle is perfectly shaped to the space.

396
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:55,360
Speaker 1: I found it in.

397
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,358
Speaker 1: It must have been created that way duh the anthropic principle and such.

398
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:11,693
Speaker 1: but It's hard to say because in all of the experiences we've ever had Both with humans and with animals and plants and everything if a stronger or more advanced anything comes into contact with a weaker one It pretty much just takes it over.

399
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:17,776
Speaker 0: Yep So why risk it, you know, it's the most likely outcome, but what I think same universe, right?

400
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:18,740
Speaker 0: What I mean, huh?

401
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,101
Speaker 1: Mr.

402
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:20,687
Speaker 1: Hawking is incredibly smart.

403
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:23,257
Speaker 1: No, no, no, he's a genius.

404
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,605
Speaker 1: He's one of those Human beings.

405
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,549
Speaker 0: look so smart to me.

406
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,980
Speaker 0: I mean he can't even talk dude to ever live.

407
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:36,020
Speaker 1: He can sing But I think what he's doing right now is making himself future proof.

408
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:39,820
Speaker 1: I don't think he's had any major insights at least in this front.

409
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,186
Speaker 1: Like I don't think he was sitting there one day.

410
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:43,536
Speaker 1: He's like, wait a minute time travel is possible.

411
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:52,280
Speaker 1: And here's why I Think what he's thinking is that we're probably gonna figure something out at some point in the next hundred thousand years.

412
00:23:53,222 --> 00:24:04,850
Speaker 1: If I say time travel is not possible Which is likely that it's not possible at least in a way that we could understand or take advantage of and Someone does something that is akin to time travel.

413
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:05,674
Speaker 1: I'll be in.

414
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,368
Speaker 1: the history book says yeah He was mostly right, but we proved him wrong on this.

415
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:17,409
Speaker 1: if I just say it's possible someday If it's never possible, no one will ever call me on it.

416
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:20,380
Speaker 1: And if we find out it's possible, I'll be a visionary.

417
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think he's already a visionary.

418
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,240
Speaker 0: I don't think he really needs but he really needs that.

419
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:32,556
Speaker 1: Look at the way he writes the kind of person he is I would bet a lot that he's future-proofing himself with that time travel thing.

420
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:49,160
Speaker 0: I don't know I think what he's actually doing right, which is a much more Occam's razor idea Is that you know, he's so good at explaining advanced physics in ways that just even a normal person can sort of understand the concept You know and that's if you read his books the ones that are you know meant for mass consumption.

421
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,883
Speaker 0: That's what you're gonna get.

422
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:53,400
Speaker 0: You're gonna get like crazy astrophysics that you can understand.

423
00:24:55,242 --> 00:25:06,374
Speaker 0: The way is that people are less interested in science technology and whatever and the approach He's taking is to say sort of things, you know about stuff that people care about.

424
00:25:06,394 --> 00:25:10,419
Speaker 0: if he talks about time travel and aliens People are gonna pay attention to that even normal people.

425
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:18,486
Speaker 0: So what he can do is he can talk about time travel and aliens and he's sort of trying to get people to care About science and physics and whatever.

426
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:25,160
Speaker 0: would you know when normal people don't care right now as much and he's you know It's a it's a good strategy to bring people back into it.

427
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,414
Speaker 0: You know, maybe he's gonna sell some books and may you know, that's fine.

428
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:29,780
Speaker 0: That's you know, selfish interest.

429
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,662
Speaker 0: but then maybe one of those people will read the book and maybe those people will become more science minded and then the world be Better.

430
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,718
Speaker 0: because I have one more science II person, you know.

431
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,642
Speaker 1: Well, that is.

432
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:43,478
Speaker 0: if he just always talked in his hardcore physics way normal people wouldn't give a crap.

433
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,386
Speaker 1: in general We need we need another Carl Sagan.

434
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:51,960
Speaker 1: Carl Sagan got an entire generation of scientists to care about science and Cosmo still holds up.

435
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,408
Speaker 1: But I feel like with modern internet kids.

436
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:59,140
Speaker 1: We need like a new a modern like a Twitter slash 4chan cosmos.

437
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:19,340
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's possible, but we need we really do need to get people excited about science because Kids who at least are in any way Skeptical and rational and reasonable or at least are confronted with the fact that there's beauty in the world That is scientific, you know deconstructing the rainbow is a rainbow less beautiful if you know how it works.

438
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:23,260
Speaker 1: I think that would go a long way to fight religious extremism and the such in the world.

439
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:28,180
Speaker 0: I mean if you look at some of the things he said too, it's like he's like, okay, so time travel.

440
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:32,200
Speaker 0: So let's say you had a train and the trainer went around the world so fast.

441
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,340
Speaker 0: So if it went around the world this fast time would actually slow down on the train.

442
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,839
Speaker 0: So if you looked at the train that people would be going real slow.

443
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:44,620
Speaker 0: It's like well, what if a girl you know The train is going almost the speed of light and then a girl is on the train and she starts running really fast?

444
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:47,080
Speaker 0: Isn't she gonna get past the speed of light and break the rules?

445
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,285
Speaker 0: We already know that.

446
00:26:48,426 --> 00:26:51,480
Speaker 0: no because the time will slow down for her even more.

447
00:26:51,520 --> 00:27:00,552
Speaker 0: so the other people on the train will be looking at her going real slow motion compared to them and Basically, you know, they'll get older as she doesn't get older.

448
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,839
Speaker 1: relativity is just like it amazes me.

449
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, this whole idea that there's kind of the it's like this.

450
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:11,114
Speaker 1: It's not a speed limit It's more like it's kind of the thing you'd see in a video game engine.

451
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:15,072
Speaker 1: Well, I think no object can be moving Faster than this this number.

452
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:16,500
Speaker 1: That's the biggest speed.

453
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:28,960
Speaker 0: So weird is that it's like, you know the faster you move just in space right like take it just walking Right the more the faster I walk and move around.

454
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,988
Speaker 1: But see you're saying that any moving.

455
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, that means you're moving.

456
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:34,811
Speaker 1: you're not just moving in space You're also moving in time, right?

457
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:45,049
Speaker 0: But if I if I move around Then like the the the moving and the time the amount of movement I have in time is Changes based on the amount of movement in space.

458
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,290
Speaker 0: if I move across a lot of space, you know Then I move across less more time.

459
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,633
Speaker 0: Ah, it's crazy.

460
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,178
Speaker 1: Well, let me even think now we're hurt.

461
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:54,860
Speaker 0: It's totally true.

462
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:57,360
Speaker 1: We're hurtling in all these different directions the crazy speeds.

463
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:04,294
Speaker 1: You know earth is moving through the galaxy and the galaxies flying out from the center of the Big Bang And there's other galaxies out there moving faster than us.

464
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:05,259
Speaker 1: We'll never be able to catch him.

465
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:13,600
Speaker 1: yep, so What do you think would happen if you had a wormhole that looked at us five minutes ago and we shot ourselves?

466
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,323
Speaker 1: from the future Can't happen.

467
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:18,407
Speaker 1: Oh, why not?

468
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:19,853
Speaker 1: What if there's a wormhole to the past?

469
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:23,314
Speaker 0: Well, actually I was reading the other day There was some guy wrote a dr.

470
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:28,660
Speaker 0: Susie in Parable about the halting problem, you know of computer science.

471
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:36,080
Speaker 0: Basically the problem is could you write a computer program that would detect when another computer program would halt?

472
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:39,089
Speaker 0: Right, like so it basically an infinite loop detector.

473
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:41,235
Speaker 0: Could you write an infinite loop detector?

474
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:47,000
Speaker 0: And the thing is, okay So I'll take this infinite loop detector and I'll run it against itself.

475
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,516
Speaker 0: will there be an infinite loop in the infinite loop detector?

476
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:57,496
Speaker 0: and Basically, if there is an infinite loop in the infinite loop detector Then the infinite loop detector will say yes.

477
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:02,180
Speaker 0: But then if the infinite loop detector says yes, then there is no infinite loop in the infinite loop detector.

478
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,540
Speaker 0: And that's to say no no, no, but then if it says no then there will be an infinite loop.

479
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,365
Speaker 0: So it doesn't work right?

480
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:14,584
Speaker 0: So basically, you know, whenever there's a paradox what it means is not that oh my god There's a crazy paradox.

481
00:29:14,644 --> 00:29:17,113
Speaker 0: What it means is that it's not possible right there.

482
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:18,860
Speaker 0: You cannot write an infinite loop detector.

483
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,172
Speaker 0: That's the answer right because writing one would be a paradox.

484
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:24,300
Speaker 0: therefore time travels the same thing.

485
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:30,188
Speaker 0: You cannot go back in time and kill yourself and have it actually kill yourself You know because that would be a paradox.

486
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,516
Speaker 0: therefore it can't happen right?

487
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,640
Speaker 0: It just it couldn't happen.

488
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,239
Speaker 0: There would be just not possible.

489
00:29:35,902 --> 00:29:41,700
Speaker 0: You know people seem to think that like paradoxes are this thing that happens and then when they happen shit gets fucked up.

490
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,684
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh No paradoxes.

491
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:49,803
Speaker 0: if there's a paradox that means that that is a scenario that can never come to be no matter what that will never Happen, of course.

492
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:55,913
Speaker 1: at the same time that's still limited by our understanding and ideas of the universe, but it's true That's that's just how it is.

493
00:29:56,175 --> 00:30:00,453
Speaker 1: Well, no But Matt does math describe the world perfectly?

494
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:01,619
Speaker 0: has it failed yet?

495
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,651
Speaker 1: Sometimes but usually just because we don't have we have an imperfect understand math.

496
00:30:05,712 --> 00:30:05,912
Speaker 1: always.

497
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,860
Speaker 0: all the correct math is always correct.

498
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:11,239
Speaker 0: Only the wrong math is wrong.

499
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,248
Speaker 1: That's really the interesting thing that math.

500
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:18,700
Speaker 1: we can use it perfectly to describe theoreticals But in the real world, it will theoretically work.

501
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,833
Speaker 1: We just can't measure things closely enough to figure out if it works on.

502
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:23,984
Speaker 0: and you know that when you measure something you modify Right.

503
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:24,511
Speaker 0: Yeah.

504
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:30,760
Speaker 1: Well, I Mean look at the world around us that we see it's just electrons banging off of what is effectively empty space.

505
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,736
Speaker 1: There's more empty space in me than there is me.

506
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:36,190
Speaker 1: Yep so time travel.

507
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:43,729
Speaker 0: Well, you do we want to talk about like, you know Real time travel or do you want to talk about?

508
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:47,745
Speaker 0: you know going really fast so that we can go to the future time I remember a long time ago.

509
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:48,508
Speaker 1: time travel is easy.

510
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:48,789
Speaker 1: Hi.

511
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:49,270
Speaker 1: Here we go.

512
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,314
Speaker 0: All right.

513
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:51,779
Speaker 1: I've got about 10 seconds.

514
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,573
Speaker 0: Me too one second per second into the future.

515
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,420
Speaker 1: You're going up for different speeds now.

516
00:30:58,282 --> 00:30:59,847
Speaker 0: Are you really I'm moving around?

517
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:00,770
Speaker 0: I'm also.

518
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,756
Speaker 0: but you know, is that really does that count?

519
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:04,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, is that enough to count?

520
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,531
Speaker 1: I'm moving away from you right now.

521
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:07,785
Speaker 1: I Continue to move away from you.

522
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:10,035
Speaker 1: that matters cuz you're not moving and I am does it?

523
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:11,000
Speaker 0: is that really enough?

524
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,659
Speaker 0: I mean cuz I mean I'm moving a little bit but would not have.

525
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:19,216
Speaker 1: Because if something if something has zero effect then doesn't exist effectively.

526
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:22,068
Speaker 1: I don't know We're not physicists.

527
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,720
Speaker 1: he most probably just banging his head.

528
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,803
Speaker 0: How am I selling it to?

529
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:29,310
Speaker 0: like move like relative to the other person.

530
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:35,972
Speaker 1: I'm moving relative to you, but I'm also kind of moving But I'm the one bearing the burden of acceleration.

531
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,520
Speaker 0: We'll see whatever.

532
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:38,544
Speaker 1: Well, we already saw.

533
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:42,660
Speaker 0: so you want to talk about some not real time travels like Terminator or what do you think?

534
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,560
Speaker 1: What would you do first Terminator or back to the future?

535
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:45,605
Speaker 0: I don't know.

536
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:50,445
Speaker 0: I think Terminator is actually kind of better than back-to-the-future Time travel.

537
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:57,611
Speaker 1: Terminator works, but it only works for the same reason that Final Fantasy 1 works time loop You know, I read.

538
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:58,940
Speaker 1: someone wrote a very long essay.

539
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:14,580
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could ever find it again, but they basically kind of proved Logically, but not mathematically or anything that the Terminator 1 & 2 forget all those other abortions work as a realistic idea of time travel if it were possible because they're self consistent in that.

540
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,445
Speaker 1: you know.

541
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:27,978
Speaker 1: the problem you'd think of is so if you go into the past and Prevent Skynet from forming then Skynet wouldn't form and you would know to send someone into the past to prevent Skynet from forming Which is true, but what could happen is?

542
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,386
Speaker 1: So you Skynet is formed.

543
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:33,160
Speaker 1: you send someone into the past to stop Skynet from forming.

544
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:36,274
Speaker 1: Skynet sends someone into the past to do you know and you have this fight.

545
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,165
Speaker 1: if you win The future happens.

546
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:43,380
Speaker 1: and then you didn't send someone back, but you've altered the timeline slightly regardless.

547
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:55,400
Speaker 1: So basically you keep looping through these the pseudo same series of events 12 monkeys style and every time it's a little different and eventually You reach in you know a million loops out a situation where?

548
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:07,970
Speaker 1: Someone from the future came to the past prevented Skynet from forming but at the same time Insured a situation would come to pass to where in the future they would know to send someone back to prevent a future that did Not actually ever occur.

549
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:13,415
Speaker 0: so Basically the so the final history it might be someone went back into the past.

550
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:13,675
Speaker 1: it might

551
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:29,317
Speaker 0: be like listen listen You know where everyone's just chilling around right, and there's some crazy scientists, and he's like look I know we're living in this paradise guys right, but in order for this paradise to work someone has to go back into the past and Make this happen.

552
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,266
Speaker 1: Right we don't know why.

553
00:33:32,948 --> 00:33:33,950
Speaker 1: we can't understand.

554
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:35,655
Speaker 0: How why couldn't you know why?

555
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,960
Speaker 0: because this Skynet thing would have been formed.

556
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,343
Speaker 0: If we don't go into the past now It's possible.

557
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:41,885
Speaker 0: You know why?

558
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,610
Speaker 0: I don't understand why knowing why.

559
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:52,626
Speaker 1: the trouble is that you know if you follow this time loop idea Then every time you go back kind of the future you came from never came to pass So you never went back.

560
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:56,542
Speaker 1: so it kind of recurses back to before anyone time-traveled Mm-hmm.

561
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,712
Speaker 1: so without that future existing.

562
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,540
Speaker 1: you know chrono trigger had the same idea.

563
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:07,937
Speaker 1: That's why they made chrono across and radical dreamers You know what some world had to have had lavos happen for the people in this world to know to go.

564
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:12,274
Speaker 1: stop lavos Mmm, or 12 monkeys actually did it very similarly.

565
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:18,596
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about that movies I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but Awesome bruce willis movie that a lot of people haven't seen.

566
00:34:18,677 --> 00:34:20,864
Speaker 0: stupidly I don't even know what it is really.

567
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:23,170
Speaker 0: until just now you've really never seen 12 monkeys.

568
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:23,833
Speaker 0: what?

569
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:24,695
Speaker 0: how many monkeys?

570
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:27,625
Speaker 1: well there's 12.

571
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,699
Speaker 0: How come not 13 monkeys?

572
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:30,725
Speaker 1: Well, that's 13 ghosts.

573
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:31,929
Speaker 0: What the hell's.

574
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,592
Speaker 0: 13 goes.

575
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:33,857
Speaker 1: you've never seen 13 ghosts.

576
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,339
Speaker 0: famous old horror movie ten zombies.

577
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:43,634
Speaker 1: Now my empire is just 13 12 monkeys and 13 ghosts.

578
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:46,163
Speaker 0: yeah $20.

579
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,009
Speaker 1: I think 13 ghosts is a vincent price movie.

580
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,933
Speaker 1: I don't actually remember.

581
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:49,735
Speaker 1: I'm not you know.

582
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,040
Speaker 1: a good move hello internet.

583
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,446
Speaker 1: I will look that up right now.

584
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:53,208
Speaker 0: I already got it.

585
00:34:53,812 --> 00:35:00,846
Speaker 1: I think it was remade though, so look wow They're one three en ghosts 2001. oh, that's a.

586
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,977
Speaker 0: that's a shitty remake and shitty remake.

587
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:07,558
Speaker 0: 13 goes 1960. that might also be William Castle.

588
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:09,969
Speaker 0: I Think it's got some stuff.

589
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:10,854
Speaker 1: I don't know.

590
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:11,317
Speaker 1: that's the one.

591
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:15,626
Speaker 1: never mind That's more recent than I thought it was but yeah It doesn't have the greatest rating in the world.

592
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:16,449
Speaker 1: it's a good movie though.

593
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,500
Speaker 0: It says five point nine out of ten on the IMDb.

594
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:20,724
Speaker 0: It's good.

595
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,410
Speaker 1: the 13 goes to the ender.

596
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:22,972
Speaker 1: hilarious.

597
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,137
Speaker 0: It's fun to be scared by.

598
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:24,257
Speaker 0: 13 goes.

599
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,259
Speaker 0: A family inherits what proves to be a haunted house, but a special pair of goggles, but the glass is on.

600
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:34,190
Speaker 0: They can see the ghosts in the house in the haunted house.

601
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:35,796
Speaker 0: Okay big deal.

602
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,127
Speaker 1: It's a good plot Horror movie.

603
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:38,733
Speaker 0: I'd rather watch.

604
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,879
Speaker 1: seventh guest Seventh guest or what about the 11th hour?

605
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,729
Speaker 0: Well, you know seventh guest is very similar to they were 11.

606
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:48,024
Speaker 1: it is and the 11th hour is basically the sequel to the seventh Guest.

607
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:54,569
Speaker 0: yep, oh shit Wow Here's some synchronicity was.

608
00:35:54,992 --> 00:36:03,003
Speaker 0: I was riding my bike home And it did clocks at 519 and then I pushed the button and I think the odometer was at like 51.9 miles or whatever.

609
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,269
Speaker 1: you know you know what right now.

610
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,155
Speaker 1: It's 653 and yesterday at the same time.

611
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:08,817
Speaker 1: It was also 653.

612
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:15,179
Speaker 0: oh shit You fucking with me man they can't be true.

613
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:18,040
Speaker 1: You really haven't seen 12 monkeys.

614
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,764
Speaker 1: I can't get over that.

615
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:21,538
Speaker 0: I even know that you you didn't see the usual suspects when I met you.

616
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still haven't seen dark city.

617
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,980
Speaker 1: that movie is not as good as 12 monk.

618
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:27,067
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand.

619
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:28,860
Speaker 0: dark city is like the great usual suspects.

620
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,146
Speaker 1: It's not as good as 12 monkeys.

621
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:32,015
Speaker 0: what you're fucked up in the head.

622
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:33,060
Speaker 1: well one 12 monkeys.

623
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:35,208
Speaker 1: I'm TV is 8.1 out of 10.

624
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:38,020
Speaker 0: all right, so what's usual suspects at IMDb?

625
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,602
Speaker 1: I don't know.

626
00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:44,940
Speaker 0: let me look since we're talking about movies We can just burn this Thursday show on whatever we got.

627
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:49,503
Speaker 1: the usual suspects is 1995 8.7.

628
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:51,330
Speaker 1: They're very similarly right.

629
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,012
Speaker 0: What's the other one 8.1?

630
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,080
Speaker 0: I told you I was right very close.

631
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,244
Speaker 0: I got you by 0.6.

632
00:36:55,244 --> 00:36:59,720
Speaker 1: That isn't a non insignificant though because this is usual suspects is newer film.

633
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:04,135
Speaker 1: It's up 10% this week, but 12 monkeys is down 6% this week.

634
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:06,946
Speaker 0: Why I don't know.

635
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,255
Speaker 1: I can't have to log into the pro version to see.

636
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:12,189
Speaker 1: I'm not paying money It's BS.

637
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,165
Speaker 1: Regardless those are good time travel movies?

638
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:20,734
Speaker 0: no not at all that have any time traveling 12 monkeys.

639
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:22,619
Speaker 0: Oh, no usual suspects.

640
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:28,266
Speaker 1: So what about back to the future?

641
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:29,671
Speaker 0: I don't know.

642
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:35,672
Speaker 0: the back to time travel in back to the future I always felt was sort of ham-fisted and not so great.

643
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,253
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

644
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:37,217
Speaker 0: You have to go at 88 miles an hour.

645
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,466
Speaker 0: Okay, no right.

646
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,048
Speaker 0: and then it's like what.

647
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:46,197
Speaker 0: you can go to the future and the past and you sort of disappear And you can make paradoxes, and it's like okay.

648
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:50,620
Speaker 0: at the same time I think it works in the sense that it makes a good movie, but it's not a good.

649
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:56,739
Speaker 0: Here's the way it works if time time travel in back to the future is like computers in summer wars.

650
00:37:56,759 --> 00:38:01,864
Speaker 1: ah Here's one thing I can say though the time traveling back to the future Works.

651
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:08,007
Speaker 1: if you consider the the the worldview that every possible You know instance spawns a million.

652
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:12,200
Speaker 1: You know every different possible universe, so this follows one universe.

653
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:13,426
Speaker 1: We're in that universe.

654
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,475
Speaker 1: we follow the timeline of this one guy.

655
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:16,520
Speaker 1: what time travel.

656
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,130
Speaker 0: So he doesn't go to different universes.

657
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,700
Speaker 0: when he time travels only the same one.

658
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:21,890
Speaker 1: Maybe he jumps universes or maybe.

659
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,880
Speaker 1: so then jumping is that universe?

660
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,771
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, maybe I mean that explains the whole no free will thing.

661
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,256
Speaker 1: every possible thing happens.

662
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:31,720
Speaker 1: He doesn't have any free will.

663
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,120
Speaker 1: He didn't make any decisions.

664
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:39,785
Speaker 1: We just watched the non free will iteration through all those events through that one universe Mm-hmm, which followed him.

665
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:46,598
Speaker 0: the thing is the universe had a history, and then it had a different history, so I didn't Had it so it had dirt.

666
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:55,607
Speaker 1: With this idea the timeline goes you know big bang all the way up to him going back in time And then the history.

667
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,340
Speaker 1: just the next step is like you've got two timelines.

668
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,387
Speaker 1: You're sticking behind each other.

669
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,218
Speaker 1: the next day is in the 50s.

670
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,727
Speaker 0: So the whole universe actually changes to the 50s.

671
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:09,637
Speaker 0: yes, so instead actually that's not a bad view of time travel.

672
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:16,860
Speaker 0: instead of you Traveling in time right what you actually do is you basically rewind the whole universe.

673
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:27,811
Speaker 0: You're actually going forward in time always But you're just rearranging all the atoms of the entire universe to be in a prior Configuration just like you're rewinding a videotape to start playing from an earlier point.

674
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:29,194
Speaker 0: right so it is.

675
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:31,460
Speaker 0: you know time is marching forward.

676
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:36,140
Speaker 0: It's you know, but everything all the atoms are being moved around to the wave.

677
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,593
Speaker 0: You know all the sub every single particle and every all the energy in the universe.

678
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:44,252
Speaker 0: the only thing is you know what law of Physics that breaks which one entropy's.

679
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:45,919
Speaker 0: you're basically undoing entropy's.

680
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:51,282
Speaker 1: No, because you could be injecting outside energy and say you're in another universe And you're.

681
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:57,179
Speaker 1: you find a universe, and you basically inject energy into it and control it to make it your own personal TV.

682
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,749
Speaker 1: That I don't know.

683
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:03,180
Speaker 1: maybe I mean the idea.

684
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:07,960
Speaker 0: What you would do is you have to create some entropy in one part of the universe because you know.

685
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:13,420
Speaker 0: But then you could rewind the rest of the universe as law But as long as the end result was greater entropies.

686
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:23,144
Speaker 0: But by in doing so when you played it forward that added entropy it would not play forward the same way it played forward before Because that entropy is adding a new Element.

687
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:26,097
Speaker 1: that's also possibly one of the ways out of you know the front row crew.

688
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:32,472
Speaker 1: for a while We had this whole thing for all you listeners Understanding where we were arguing about free will.

689
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:40,165
Speaker 1: ever since all the physics articles talking about how it's basically Not possible for there to be free will probably not yeah But basically there are.

690
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:50,180
Speaker 1: there's a small number of kind of philosophical or possible scientific escapes from that trap And one of them is the idea that we theoretically cannot escape from our universe or interact with the outside.

691
00:40:50,721 --> 00:41:03,228
Speaker 1: But free will could arise in a situation where the universe is 100% deterministic and going along a path But then it's influenced from outside of the universe by something else And we don't know what the rules are.

692
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:07,423
Speaker 0: we still not have free will therefore It is outside.

693
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:18,239
Speaker 0: influence is actually just another force controlling our will and even if it is a force that you know is not A force that we can understand within our laws of physics is still a force We have no will full.

694
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:28,698
Speaker 1: What it would mean is that external things could possibly have free will and then they Screw up the predetermined destiny of the universe that we're in.

695
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:33,560
Speaker 1: They could screw it up in such a way as to give someone internally free will by kind of fun.

696
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:39,917
Speaker 0: It would still give you an illusion of free will because even though something could fuck up right it has to be.

697
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:45,674
Speaker 0: you know a The decision that is made has to be a product of a conscious decision.

698
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,300
Speaker 0: in a human brain.

699
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:57,508
Speaker 0: If the fuck up is because some guy from outside the universe comes and flicks me and makes me turn left instead of right You know I didn't decide to turn left or right.

700
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:58,351
Speaker 0: that wasn't the cause.

701
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:12,400
Speaker 1: the root cause has to be you know from an animal brain in order to free will pulls your you know the the total of your memories and consciousness out of the universe and Instills it with free will from that point forward somehow.

702
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,049
Speaker 1: So now it is a self-moving body.

703
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:28,566
Speaker 1: like the decision is made he replaces your brain with some material from the outside and your consciousness resides outside or in this material and has control and it basically can control the Physicality of your body.

704
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,220
Speaker 0: so my brain is in another universe.

705
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:38,153
Speaker 0: But then there is some you know like wormhole ish link between the other universe in this universe Through which my brain can control my body.

706
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:56,520
Speaker 0: so no scientist would ever See the free will coming from my brain because all they would see was the brain in this universe Which looks like is just doing stuff, but it's actually receiving completely undetectable signals from a free will at another universe and That so it appears to be having no free will of its own whatsoever.

707
00:42:56,961 --> 00:43:02,760
Speaker 0: But the free will component is like in the hundredth dimension or some crazy fuck shit that we just made up.

708
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,967
Speaker 1: I think there's only 11 dimensions according to Kaku.

709
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,718
Speaker 0: so it's in the 13th dimension where they go with the ghosts and the zombies.

710
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:20,020
Speaker 0: and In fact no this all our all our Consciousnesses all our free wills are actually in the brains of 13 monkeys combined, and there's another universe which is monkeys.

711
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:21,368
Speaker 1: I remember reading hyperspace.

712
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:25,880
Speaker 1: They talked about how the fourth spatial dimension Was probably bigger at some point.

713
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,020
Speaker 1: I'm paraphrasing for when I was a young kid.

714
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:31,375
Speaker 1: But it collapsed and we're basically in it and we can move within it.

715
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:32,400
Speaker 1: you know strength theory and all that.

716
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:36,807
Speaker 1: But it's a cylinder, and it's so small that no matter how far we move We don't really move enough.

717
00:43:37,229 --> 00:43:39,660
Speaker 1: like it's like we move around the cylinder so fast.

718
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,849
Speaker 1: There's basically no difference between whatever position.

719
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,339
Speaker 1: We're in in that universe or in that dimension.

720
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:52,505
Speaker 1: But if we start like imagine we name and find stuff at all the dimensions like the 11th dimension just dicks Just everywhere dicks.

721
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:53,991
Speaker 0: It's possible.

722
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:54,172
Speaker 1: Well.

723
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,778
Speaker 1: It's already poking through fortune.

724
00:43:57,598 --> 00:44:00,243
Speaker 0: I Think fortune.

725
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:02,270
Speaker 0: I think it wasn't that the fourth dimension.

726
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,393
Speaker 0: I mean 4chan isn't it?

727
00:44:03,413 --> 00:44:07,298
Speaker 1: well if the fourth dimension is a cylinder I mean, it's kind of a primordial phallus.

728
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,928
Speaker 0: Okay, that's enough of that all right stuff of that.

729
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:12,573
Speaker 1: any other time travel movie.

730
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:17,389
Speaker 1: We can kill some time with I don't know Kill time boy you miss chairs there.

731
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:20,380
Speaker 0: any other non movie time travel discussion, okay?

732
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:25,316
Speaker 0: Let's pretend that movie science fiction time travel was totally for real.

733
00:44:25,356 --> 00:44:26,580
Speaker 1: which movies time travel?

734
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:30,110
Speaker 1: Anyone you want back to the future is the easiest one.

735
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,234
Speaker 1: so what would you?

736
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:32,197
Speaker 0: what would you do?

737
00:44:34,242 --> 00:44:36,252
Speaker 1: Well, maybe what about hyperion time travel?

738
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:37,679
Speaker 0: pick whatever you want.

739
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:38,644
Speaker 0: Just what were you know?

740
00:44:38,664 --> 00:44:41,537
Speaker 0: you can pick any kind of time travel and do any kind of thing.

741
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:42,019
Speaker 0: What would you do?

742
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:52,033
Speaker 1: Honestly my a fantasy of mine would be the ability to travel back in time But in a non interactive manner because that couldn't cause any paradoxes.

743
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:55,344
Speaker 1: if I could simply view the Sure, you can do it.

744
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:56,269
Speaker 0: You can do whatever you want.

745
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:58,460
Speaker 0: You can you know you have a you have a scrying pool.

746
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,605
Speaker 0: You can watch all of history.

747
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

748
00:45:00,107 --> 00:45:02,015
Speaker 1: I'd watch the big bang of course.

749
00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:08,208
Speaker 1: I don't know where I'd watch it from But I'd watch the pyramids being built.

750
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:11,060
Speaker 1: you know see oh they did it some obvious physics way.

751
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:14,720
Speaker 0: I would also want to see some pyramids because they're smart people.

752
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:16,464
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty safe to say that.

753
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:17,907
Speaker 0: any secret of history.

754
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:18,809
Speaker 0: We would want to see.

755
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:22,049
Speaker 0: right yeah Is there any secret of history you don't want to see?

756
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,109
Speaker 0: uh?

757
00:45:23,561 --> 00:45:26,135
Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to see what happened to your mom last night again, okay?

758
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:35,812
Speaker 0: It's not exactly a secret of history right you know you can watch great works being created And you could you know recover things that were lost like it.

759
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:38,220
Speaker 0: There's a movie that was lost like metropolis.

760
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,010
Speaker 0: You can watch it.

761
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,840
Speaker 1: You just go watch it.

762
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know something like that.

763
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,464
Speaker 0: That's easy to do.

764
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:55,612
Speaker 0: and then what I would do is I would take all the stuff right and I would take all the people That I care about and I would go into the future or the past and also throughout space And I would find the best possible place and time to live.

765
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:56,736
Speaker 0: and that's the place that I would go.

766
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:59,568
Speaker 1: well clearly That's the 11th dimension now.

767
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:08,518
Speaker 0: You know it's like if I find out that like a hundred years in the future in You know Spain or something that this like everything's perfect for like a period of 200 years.

768
00:46:08,578 --> 00:46:12,030
Speaker 0: I'd be like all right Let's go live our lives out in that time period in that place.

769
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,479
Speaker 0: You know and I'll be it and that's how I'd roll.

770
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:28,526
Speaker 1: I Just I feel like we might have the capability Probably not in our lifetimes, but I think at some point humans will have the ability to somehow Read information from the past in some capacity Maybe by you know if books.

771
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:39,287
Speaker 1: well if there's no call if there's a perfect causal chain you know that whole idea or Maybe a near-perfect causal chain then theoretically you could Reconstruct the path backward from where you are now.

772
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,000
Speaker 1: the trouble is with entropy is that we currently don't have the ability to do that.

773
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,886
Speaker 1: No cause of entropy.

774
00:46:43,906 --> 00:46:44,350
Speaker 1: I mean well.

775
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:44,873
Speaker 0: No we can't.

776
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:53,240
Speaker 0: because of that Maybe because of entry but also because of the information theory stuff that people are talking about where it's like okay to simulate the universe.

777
00:46:53,682 --> 00:47:02,740
Speaker 0: You would also need you need all the information of the universe But you can't possibly hold all the information of the universe in the universe because if you could you basically made it would be bigger.

778
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,640
Speaker 1: Then you can't do it or at best the best you could do is make the universe an exact copy of it.

779
00:47:07,805 --> 00:47:07,980
Speaker 1: Yeah

780
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:21,930
Speaker 0: But you couldn't make a copy of the universe in the universe because that would be a require the entire universe and thus You could not make you know a copy of a Scott within a Scott because you basically have to use the entire Scott to do It and then you would end up with the Scott you started.

781
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:24,657
Speaker 1: what about a fat guy that already has enough room for a Scott inside of him?

782
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:31,220
Speaker 0: But then you're not that that mean we need a second universe already that we would then transform to be a copy of our universe.

783
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,566
Speaker 0: we only have one universe to work with.

784
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:34,254
Speaker 1: maybe that's our way out of entropy is we?

785
00:47:34,294 --> 00:47:39,115
Speaker 1: when we get near the end we find a universe that's just formed and we Send all our shit there.

786
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:41,483
Speaker 0: I Guess that could work.

787
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:44,214
Speaker 0: I mean that's basically the same solution we have for everything right?

788
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:45,600
Speaker 0: Oh car country is burned down.

789
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,464
Speaker 0: Let's go to another one.

790
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:47,892
Speaker 0: Oh our planets burning down.

791
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:49,339
Speaker 0: Let's go to another one our universe burn.

792
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,243
Speaker 0: now Let's go to another one.

793
00:47:50,263 --> 00:47:59,313
Speaker 1: You know that's not an interesting solution, but it's probably the best solution, maybe I Mean really I just you know.

794
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,300
Speaker 1: it goes back to that court thing.

795
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:05,199
Speaker 1: What if we had the capacity to basically turn on a camera at any point in history and just watch?

796
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,928
Speaker 0: We would turn on a camera at any point history and watch?

797
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:11,480
Speaker 1: yeah, and it really simplify having jury trials.

798
00:48:11,961 --> 00:48:18,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, one thing that I think is interesting about at least the forward time travel is Stephen Hawking talks about which is totally real right with Relativity.

799
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:27,610
Speaker 0: is that you know we think oh, we can't possibly achieve Traveling you know far out to other stars and planets because it takes too fucking long.

800
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,939
Speaker 0: And it does take too fucking long.

801
00:48:28,979 --> 00:48:35,684
Speaker 0: like if spaceship took off now Then it would be like a zillion generations before they heard back from.

802
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:41,506
Speaker 0: you know assuming that we they could even communicate Over such great distances from the spaceship that reached Alpha Centauri or whatever the fuck.

803
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,770
Speaker 0: you're good dramaturge Who knows where the hell you're going right like the galaxy?

804
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:50,124
Speaker 1: We're heading for Venus, but the thing is if I'm still we stand tall.

805
00:48:50,204 --> 00:49:02,186
Speaker 0: if you can get your spaceship to go faster Like close to the speed of light fast enough right it'll actually get you to Pretty far away in a reasonable time as far as you're concerned because time is so slow.

806
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:03,410
Speaker 0: you know slowing down for you.

807
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,180
Speaker 0: Well, it's so long as you're going so fast.

808
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:14,710
Speaker 1: the trouble is it still won't get you Anywhere that there is to get because that the closest thing anywhere outside of our solar system is so far away.

809
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:18,441
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean if you're traveling close to the speed of light.

810
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,966
Speaker 0: It'll be a matter of like.

811
00:49:20,006 --> 00:49:21,350
Speaker 1: you know hundreds of light years.

812
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:25,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, so hundreds of years right you will get there.

813
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:25,185
Speaker 0: I?

814
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:26,650
Speaker 1: Think.

815
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:38,250
Speaker 1: more interesting is you know Hyperion talked about this Phoenix talked about this is that we can use forward time travel to Create kind of wealths of knowledge and elder wisdom.

816
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:43,210
Speaker 1: I mean how many stories are there now of the idea that you've got a group of elders who?

817
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:49,810
Speaker 1: Come to the earth give a bunch of decisions and then fly up into a spaceship and circle the earth once very fast.

818
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:54,887
Speaker 1: You know basically traveling forward in time 100 years, so they reappear every hundred years.

819
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:56,673
Speaker 1: see how far We've come in a hundred years.

820
00:49:56,974 --> 00:50:01,670
Speaker 1: have the wisdom of the last 10 million years of seeing a day's worth of human history.

821
00:50:02,052 --> 00:50:16,530
Speaker 0: Well, I mean once you know we have pretty good data storage right now We could load like a whole shit ton of knowledge into a bunch of hard drives Take a whole bunch of extras and just fly them around the earth real fast And that could be someone's job, and I would totally sign up for that.

822
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:18,358
Speaker 1: I would go into the future you need to bring.

823
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,629
Speaker 0: the thing is though you would need to bring a whole crew.

824
00:50:20,669 --> 00:50:22,357
Speaker 0: you would Need a doctor right you would?

825
00:50:22,377 --> 00:50:24,849
Speaker 0: you need like two doctors to computer.

826
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:27,440
Speaker 0: peep You know mole you probably need the four computer people right?

827
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:30,715
Speaker 0: you need some astronauts who could repair the shit You would need.

828
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:31,017
Speaker 0: right.

829
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:38,299
Speaker 0: and the thing is every time you came down What you'd probably do is you would get all new technology all new stuff But the thing is right.

830
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,850
Speaker 0: what if you go around?

831
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:45,388
Speaker 0: And then you're going around looking at the earth and the earth is basically going in fast motion from your from your perspective.

832
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:46,472
Speaker 0: because right You're.

833
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:46,733
Speaker 0: why?

834
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:49,603
Speaker 0: basically watching the earth and fast-forward with your telescopes or whatever.

835
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:51,610
Speaker 0: It's like Sim City right exactly?

836
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,161
Speaker 1: So you don't have to sit out there, then you see nukes like damn it.

837
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:58,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just see the earth is like turns Brown like freaking space about to be on the toe.

838
00:50:58,484 --> 00:50:58,988
Speaker 0: you're like fuck.

839
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:04,186
Speaker 1: What do I do now come back down like what the fuck did you guys do the whole thing.

840
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:05,170
Speaker 0: you basically gave up your whole?

841
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,269
Speaker 0: Human life for that and now is nothing, but at the same time What do you do now?

842
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:20,657
Speaker 0: You know you escaped so you basically had to bring some women's and some in some dudes And you basically have to have the plan of okay, you know if this doesn't if we see the earth turn to shit We have to go down and start again.

843
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,750
Speaker 0: You know it's like the insurance policy for the whole earth.

844
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,543
Speaker 1: There's always the fun time travel like the girl who left through time.

845
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:27,930
Speaker 0: I didn't watch that yet.

846
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:28,854
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't watch that.

847
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:30,161
Speaker 1: the same person did summer wars.

848
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:31,929
Speaker 1: I know I can't believe you got to see that.

849
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, tell me how many other million things.

850
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:34,622
Speaker 0: I haven't seen.

851
00:51:34,642 --> 00:51:36,350
Speaker 0: I don't 12 monkeys, okay?

852
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:39,288
Speaker 0: You didn't see dark city still.

853
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:44,615
Speaker 1: I Think we've talked enough about time travel.

854
00:51:44,956 --> 00:51:45,257
Speaker 0: all right.

855
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:45,919
Speaker 0: That's cool.

856
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:46,501
Speaker 1: We'll kill it.

857
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:48,587
Speaker 1: See you next week kids.

858
00:51:49,008 --> 00:51:49,570
Speaker 0: It's killed.

859
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:51,829
Speaker 1: Mustn't kill time boy.

860
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:01,760
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

861
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,683
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
