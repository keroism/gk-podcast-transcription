1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,375
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday December 18th.

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,218
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:14,844
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,930
Speaker 1: We review St.. Petersburg.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,051
Speaker 1: Let's do

6
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:25,396
Speaker 0: this

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:44,197
Speaker 1: Alright, so back when the local gaming scene was a little bit better than it is now You know we met some cool people and one time we went over and played some games with this guy who was Much harder core into gaming than we were but much less core into other things that we were into like.

8
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,745
Speaker 1: I guess he wasn't a Big anime fan.

9
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:46,551
Speaker 1: you might have liked anime.

10
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:46,954
Speaker 1: I don't know.

11
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:47,800
Speaker 1: we didn't know him that well.

12
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:52,335
Speaker 1: We knew well enough to go and play some board games with him because you don't really have to know someone that well to do that.

13
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:55,413
Speaker 1: Anyway, he was telling us about all these games.

14
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:56,156
Speaker 1: We didn't know about.

15
00:00:56,177 --> 00:01:00,854
Speaker 0: yeah, meanwhile We're all playing shadows over Camelot and getting totally punked by the traitor.

16
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:02,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know that's a game Where.

17
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:07,548
Speaker 1: well let's not talk about that game now, but He showed us this game called dune.

18
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:11,822
Speaker 1: Yes, dune the same dune is written by By who?

19
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:14,111
Speaker 0: Scott Herbert Frank Herbert.

20
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:16,480
Speaker 1: yes, right that am I right, okay?

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,680
Speaker 1: Let me just let me tell you my dune situation here.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:33,240
Speaker 1: I tried to read dune because I knew it was some famous sci-fi book way back way back like Probably between middle and high school or some long time 1965 something like that and I was not the fan and I didn't even finish reading the first book.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,459
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty sure is the first book because it was just called dune and nothing else, and I was not a fan.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,710
Speaker 1: Nowadays, I don't really remember it that well.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,069
Speaker 1: so who knows if I'm a fan, but then again I'm not about to find out.

26
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,298
Speaker 1: cuz I got better things to do.

27
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:49,780
Speaker 1: then Read a book that I probably won't like cuz I didn't like it the last time.

28
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:51,993
Speaker 1: I don't think I've changed that much anyway.

29
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:53,220
Speaker 0: We'll probably get some hate mail.

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,551
Speaker 0: We got an email not too long ago from someone.

31
00:01:55,933 --> 00:02:01,859
Speaker 0: it was one of those YTM n DS And it was crying Fremen, but it was crying Freeman.

32
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,480
Speaker 1: Yeah Blue eyes and this music playing and it said crying Fremen on it on top and I was like.

33
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:12,397
Speaker 1: He told me that it was a combination joke between dune and crying Freeman, and I was like.

34
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,280
Speaker 0: that much was obvious.

35
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,360
Speaker 1: The problem was is that rim has read some dune, but read not crying Freeman.

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,612
Speaker 1: And I've read all of crying Freeman, but not the dune.

37
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:22,820
Speaker 1: so we needed luckily our friends.

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,615
Speaker 1: We're here to help us combine to get the joke of course.

39
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:30,297
Speaker 0: then I looked at it And it's just the crying Freeman guy with blue eyes crying.

40
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,416
Speaker 1: yeah anyway so dune which I'm not a fan of.

41
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:40,375
Speaker 1: but The guy shows us the dune game, which is a Avalon Hill bookshelf game from 1979. the game is older than me now.

42
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,069
Speaker 0: I'm not much of a collector or anything like that.

43
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,390
Speaker 0: I mean we had a friend way back who brought over like a 1912 era board game that we played.

44
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,355
Speaker 1: it was a bad game.

45
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,700
Speaker 0: of course it was a bad game But at the same time it was interesting just to see this ancient thing.

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, as much it was the kind of thing you that would be.

47
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,600
Speaker 1: do just as well in like a glass case in museum.

48
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:04,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the kind of thing they hungry Joe would have been playing as a kid exactly.

49
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,340
Speaker 1: so so this dune game.

50
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:11,825
Speaker 1: He we don't actually play the game when we meet the guy But he tells us all about it.

51
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:22,045
Speaker 1: first of all obviously it's out of print because it's incredibly old and no one would want such A thing, but the way the interesting thing about the game is I think there's six different sides that you can be all the different You know races.

52
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,198
Speaker 1: I guess that are involved in on the planet.

53
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,707
Speaker 0: well factions more like factions.

54
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 1: all right and Each faction has a different power.

55
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:35,440
Speaker 1: But he he started to tell us the powers of the different factions.

56
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:39,092
Speaker 1: He told us the power of the first faction, and I'm like that is.

57
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:49,140
Speaker 1: I don't even know how the game worked at all But I could tell from his description of the power of the faction that it was totally unfair and stupidly powerful.

58
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,780
Speaker 1: It's like imagine if there were different factions.

59
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,797
Speaker 1: You could be a monopoly and I'd be like yeah, monopoly the top hat gets to roll four dice instead of two.

60
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:57,800
Speaker 1: you go fuck.

61
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,233
Speaker 1: No, that is so unfair.

62
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:00,823
Speaker 1: fuck that Top hat.

63
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:12,791
Speaker 0: every time he proceeds to tell us what the powers are of all the rest of the factions The dog starts with twice as much money The car starts with boardwalk monopoly and eight hotels.

64
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:15,700
Speaker 1: the battleship gets hotels for a dollar each.

65
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:29,800
Speaker 1: That's the game and the idea of a game with six different sides where each side You know it basically plays by the same rules, but they each have a ludicrous, but different superpower.

66
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:35,458
Speaker 1: That sounds like a good game, and it's it's a lot different from a lot of other games We played and after I've read the rules last night.

67
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:44,956
Speaker 1: basically I bought the game on eBay because it was very hard to buy and I managed to get a used copy for like 45 bucks Which is a steal because I tried to bid on like a new copy and it went for like 120 something.

68
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:48,653
Speaker 0: yeah I went back to millennium games because that's pretty much our.

69
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,260
Speaker 0: if we ever need a game We can always get it from those guys.

70
00:04:51,280 --> 00:05:00,087
Speaker 0: And I got the owner and the managers business cards, and I go in and I'm like hey I'm looking for a somewhat rare out-of-print game And he's like hit me the dune game.

71
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:03,097
Speaker 0: He laughs and says no one who knows what that is would sell it.

72
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:03,719
Speaker 0: the game's great.

73
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,570
Speaker 1: Anyway, the game you can buy it on eBay.

74
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:15,610
Speaker 1: There are a bunch of copies there, but I got a Surprisingly good condition used copy with all the pieces For like 45 bucks, and I read the rules last night.

75
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,898
Speaker 0: It smells a little bit like grandma, but that's okay.

76
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:26,813
Speaker 1: That's fine That's fine, and I read the rules and I can tell you this game The only game that I find it really similar to is diplomacy.

77
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:35,793
Speaker 1: in a way cuz there's you can like bribe anyone with almost you know no restrictions and at almost at any time and They have to do whatever.

78
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:39,351
Speaker 0: the bribe was A game that allows that.

79
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,656
Speaker 0: I mean you can do that monopoly.

80
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:48,168
Speaker 0: you can do that in a lot of games But a game that actually has mechanics or requires people to follow through on deals Yep is a lot more interest.

81
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:54,135
Speaker 1: you can also make alliances and have joint victories But you can only make and break alliances at certain junctures in the game.

82
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:57,860
Speaker 1: and the third thing I'm gonna tell you about this game cuz I already told you three things.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,725
Speaker 1: I guess there's a fourth thing.

84
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,379
Speaker 1: I'm telling you about the game fanatical devotion to the Pope.

85
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,166
Speaker 1: yes Yes for four things all right.

86
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:10,980
Speaker 1: the the other interesting thing about this game is you most games It's like information is either you show it or you don't write like Antigris and Euphrates.

87
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:14,120
Speaker 1: You don't show your tiles you don't show your points.

88
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,893
Speaker 1: It's not like you know but in monopoly you show your money.

89
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,779
Speaker 1: you show what properties you have right?

90
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:26,100
Speaker 1: In Dune most of your stuff you can choose to show or not to show.

91
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:30,260
Speaker 1: There's only one thing I think these treachery cards because there's a limit of four.

92
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:41,046
Speaker 1: I think we're at a certain point in the game Which is the point at which you can get more treachery cards you have to show how many you have so that way There's no cheating, but other than that I think you don't have to show.

93
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:44,560
Speaker 1: so it's I really like that that you can show or not show.

94
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:57,406
Speaker 0: Well, we've been partly because we don't have the you know five people around all the time to play the big five and six player games that we haven't exhausted yet, we've exhausted two and three player gaming and We need more games and get.

95
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:04,677
Speaker 0: and it seems like eventually we're gonna get to the point where the only games that are really Not solved or not broken or not random are the games that are.

96
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:16,398
Speaker 0: basically The game is just the setting and the actual game is more like diplomacy where you're gaming the other people you're playing directly Against other people where the stakes are kind of more up in the air.

97
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:28,334
Speaker 1: well I think you know what games like this game and diplomacy are is they're sort of like board games But they're really sort of role-playing games But also psychology games and you know the it's just you're.

98
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:32,788
Speaker 1: you're doing role-playing in Psychology in an attempt to manipulate the board.

99
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:33,790
Speaker 0: now granted rather

100
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,600
Speaker 1: than just manipulating the board directly with role-playing in psychology not mattering

101
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,474
Speaker 0: I've been known to do that sort of thing in say Shogun,

102
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:49,805
Speaker 1: but yeah There's a line where it sort of like goes from metagaming to role-playing and it's sort of like diplomacy and doing around one side And show guns on the other side.

103
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,351
Speaker 0: yeah, but regardless.

104
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,560
Speaker 0: I'm very much looking forward to playing this game.

105
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:54,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though.

106
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:55,567
Speaker 1: I don't like dune.

107
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:58,639
Speaker 1: I'm sure this game will be cool at least from what I've read.

108
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,467
Speaker 0: So what do you got in the news since?

109
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:00,809
Speaker 0: uh?

110
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,577
Speaker 1: Oh, it's such a bad news week.

111
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,300
Speaker 1: You have no idea.

112
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,638
Speaker 0: There's plenty of good news.

113
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, the how come it took you so long to find a news story, and I found one before you did.

114
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,410
Speaker 0: well There's plenty of good news, but there's not.

115
00:08:10,993 --> 00:08:12,120
Speaker 0: I've already talked about all of it.

116
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,227
Speaker 0: I mean oh the Wii is selling out.

117
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:15,812
Speaker 1: host that's gonna be your news.

118
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,096
Speaker 1: You better not.

119
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:18,380
Speaker 0: the ps3 isn't selling out.

120
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,320
Speaker 1: Oh snap anyway, so there was announcement today or recently that there's gonna be all sorts of like better games on the iPod.

121
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:31,009
Speaker 1: You know and that's not surprising cuz yeah, there's there's new iPods out like they came out recently.

122
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:38,082
Speaker 1: they have better screens and better stuff all around and So that I think there's games like you know peggle and Sonic the Hedgehog.

123
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,267
Speaker 1: you're gonna come to the iPod.

124
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:41,755
Speaker 0: Sonic the Hedgehog is the one that got my attention here.

125
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:50,369
Speaker 1: Yeah now You know that I guess this you know something to be said for this and that there's a lot of iPods out there possibly even More iPods than DS.

126
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:50,651
Speaker 1: is that?

127
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:51,054
Speaker 1: I don't know.

128
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:51,920
Speaker 1: it's it's pretty close.

129
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:52,364
Speaker 1: I'd have to.

130
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:57,956
Speaker 1: I imagine there's more iPods But I don't know if more of the new iPods that are capable of playing Sonic the Hedgehog.

131
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,538
Speaker 1: We got to see.

132
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:08,920
Speaker 1: So it makes sense that you know someone to try to make and sell games for a device capable of playing them and You know try to make a lot of money that that makes sense.

133
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:16,460
Speaker 1: What doesn't make sense to me at least is why anyone would ever actually want to play a game on their iPod now?

134
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:23,946
Speaker 0: It's not just a matter of oh well What if you are just a casual gamer and maybe you don't have a DS even though you probably should especially if you're a casual gamer?

135
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:33,200
Speaker 0: but yep To me playing a game on like an iPod is just So unfun and not worth it that I'd rather be doing something else.

136
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:41,140
Speaker 0: It's like if I'm gonna kill time I might as well read a book or something because it's just not worth it to play a game on these not gaming consoles.

137
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:47,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it if you have a camera right a cam imagine if you have a digital camera is designed to take pictures.

138
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:48,924
Speaker 1: It's possible.

139
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,789
Speaker 1: a digital camera has a screen and buttons.

140
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:56,880
Speaker 1: you could theoretically I see no reason why not write some software to play a video game on your digital camera.

141
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:02,916
Speaker 1: But because the design of the digital camera is such that playing the game would be so uncomfortable and painful.

142
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,520
Speaker 1: It's not even worth it.

143
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,882
Speaker 1: It's not something you would want to do It's it's.

144
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:12,559
Speaker 1: I'd rather play no video game at all then play a video game in such a painful way.

145
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:26,709
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, so I think part of the reason people do play games on this is because they're probably people who don't have any gaming systems and They carry their iPod with them anyway And they're bored and they don't fee.

146
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:27,331
Speaker 1: I guess they might.

147
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:33,714
Speaker 1: they might be the kind of person who feels ashamed Whipping out a DS or something But they don't feel ashamed whipping out their iPod and pushing buttons on now.

148
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,339
Speaker 0: now I point out that this This brings up another.

149
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:44,630
Speaker 0: It was kind of tangential issue that I've noticed on the train a lot because I like you and like many other people in this Country take a train to work every day.

150
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:51,397
Speaker 0: I have a long commute where I'm sitting in a chair relatively comfortable, but there's nothing to do unless I bring something mm-hmm.

151
00:10:52,039 --> 00:11:00,971
Speaker 0: and Almost every day I get on that train and I see a lot of bored people Without any form of entertainment on them whatsoever.

152
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:03,320
Speaker 0: Just sitting there really bored.

153
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see some people like they read a newspaper, but then they finish it.

154
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,600
Speaker 1: I see some people with a book, you know, there's plenty of people who do do some.

155
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,015
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but there are a lot of people who don't.

156
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:15,609
Speaker 1: yes, it's Alma I might say it's like 40%.

157
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,332
Speaker 1: don't do anything.

158
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:17,900
Speaker 1: It's not as nice like look out the window.

159
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now you can argue some of them are sleeping.

160
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:27,238
Speaker 0: sleeping is okay No, but I can get to that too cuz I have a neck pillow and I sleep very comfortably on the train with earplugs and a neck pillow.

161
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:35,480
Speaker 0: I've seen one other person in the entirety of the time I've been commuting to New York City with any sort of pillow or anything to know.

162
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:42,500
Speaker 0: I see there's a good like handful of people but not not many most people who sleep that like their neck is just bent.

163
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:49,418
Speaker 1: Most people sleeping are just bent sideways, but there are people who have like, you know The little little mask so light doesn't get in their eyes.

164
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:52,259
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Okay, that's a little too much.

165
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,631
Speaker 1: The earplugs in the neck pillow are enough.

166
00:11:55,114 --> 00:12:01,220
Speaker 1: I take the 5-30 fucking train in I'm gonna sleep you can sleep and there's nothing wrong with sleeping on the train.

167
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,544
Speaker 0: But I think the the eye covering mask thing is too because then I don't have the light because sometimes the lights are on in The train.

168
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,859
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't like it.

169
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,407
Speaker 1: I wish there was a way to dig have.

170
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,438
Speaker 1: they should have one car in the train with the lights up.

171
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,080
Speaker 0: a lot of times They do but I don't know if that's usually by accident.

172
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:23,280
Speaker 0: But the issue is there are a lot of people who I see and there are people who aren't Entertaining themselves every moment because maybe they want to think or relax.

173
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,877
Speaker 0: But I know a lot of these people because I can see them fidget and see them just look around or like.

174
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:37,260
Speaker 0: they start watching The screen the silent screen of the DVD player that someone two seats up from them has and they just obviously they're bored out of their minds.

175
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:40,119
Speaker 0: They knew they were gonna be on a train.

176
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,100
Speaker 0: Why didn't they bring some form of entertainment.

177
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:45,171
Speaker 0: Why do people not think of that?

178
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,343
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't know.

179
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:49,651
Speaker 0: and as a result, I think a lot of.

180
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,561
Speaker 0: I see a lot of people playing just like they'll have their cell phone Out.

181
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:56,134
Speaker 0: they'll be playing like that broken pac-man that comes with a lot of shitty phones.

182
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:57,419
Speaker 0: That just doesn't even work.

183
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,147
Speaker 1: That pac-man is just so bad.

184
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,351
Speaker 1: It's not even fun.

185
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,700
Speaker 1: I mean, it's it's worse than no pac-man.

186
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:04,860
Speaker 0: It's worse than doing nothing.

187
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,150
Speaker 0: I see people doing things that I rather than doing now.

188
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:12,008
Speaker 1: I had a choice between sitting on the train and playing the shit Cellphone pac-man or sitting there bored.

189
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:15,340
Speaker 1: I would sit there bored because playing the cell phone pac-man is painful.

190
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,380
Speaker 1: It's like it's that would be like torture if someone made me play the cell phone pac-man.

191
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:23,340
Speaker 1: So I imagine Sonic the Hedgehog iPod is quite similar to that.

192
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,640
Speaker 0: But at the same time this I mean these are games like Sonic where you're gonna have to buy it, right?

193
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,706
Speaker 0: It's not just gonna be free.

194
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,900
Speaker 1: It's like five bucks on iTunes or something like that.

195
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,433
Speaker 1: So, I don't know exactly the cost but I guess it's five bucks.

196
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:34,880
Speaker 0: Who are they marketing to?

197
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:35,581
Speaker 0: I mean I'm.

198
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:43,317
Speaker 0: I would guess the only people who buy this are people who have an iPod and then they the idea of having a video Game on their iPod just makes them get all wet.

199
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:44,563
Speaker 1: Could be.

200
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:49,100
Speaker 1: actually, you know, the peggle doesn't isn't a game that would be too bad on the iPod.

201
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,865
Speaker 1: But even so peggle is a game that really needs more screen real estate and maybe on the iPhone It would work.

202
00:13:54,925 --> 00:14:01,100
Speaker 0: but on the iPod, especially the nano Small this I would make the argument beyond that that peggle is not a game.

203
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,292
Speaker 0: It is merely a Carl a colorful time waster.

204
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:04,840
Speaker 0: There is no amount of skill in that.

205
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,265
Speaker 1: No, that's not a game of skill at all.

206
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:13,573
Speaker 1: It's just it's like pachinko, but I think the iPhone though I think games on the iPhone are pretty could be pretty good.

207
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,220
Speaker 1: It's got that big dual touch screen.

208
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,930
Speaker 0: Oh, you can basically run computer games on the iPhone.

209
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

210
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,419
Speaker 1: We're talking about iPod here.

211
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,229
Speaker 1: I phone is actually a good gaming platform.

212
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:28,507
Speaker 1: I think and I think that is a a route that Apple should really Explore in greater depth.

213
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,718
Speaker 0: I just never understand why I see these people playing these chintzy games.

214
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:41,440
Speaker 0: They either Obviously didn't plan ahead and now are bored They have no form of entertainment or for whatever reason they just choose not to carry a form of entertainment.

215
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,689
Speaker 1: Also, those games are horrendously overpriced.

216
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:49,800
Speaker 1: on my Verizon phone is actually like a Phoenix Wright game I can buy right and I thought about buying it just good to play every Phoenix, right?

217
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,220
Speaker 1: But I'm pretty sure it's just one of the episodes from Phoenix Wright one.

218
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,876
Speaker 1: So I don't really want it because I've already played it on the DS, but it's so.

219
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,220
Speaker 1: I've seen screenshots of it.

220
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,369
Speaker 1: It's just so bad and they charge like five bucks for it.

221
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,006
Speaker 1: And you know what for like five dollars on the virtual console I can get a whole Nintendo game.

222
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:10,254
Speaker 1: that's better than the cell phone Phoenix Wright.

223
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,000
Speaker 1: So it's just a ripoff.

224
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:16,039
Speaker 0: So in other news the the Wii is selling out.

225
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:18,348
Speaker 1: Oh gee, that's been news for like.

226
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,303
Speaker 1: since I bought one last year on the launch day I just I Guess I didn't.

227
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:30,026
Speaker 0: I mean I expected the Wii to do well and the fact that it's doing as well as it is is far Beyond what I expected.

228
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:32,739
Speaker 0: I'm not entirely sure what's gonna come of all this.

229
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just another tickle me almost situation.

230
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,837
Speaker 0: You'll see it is the thing is next year.

231
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:38,580
Speaker 1: There'll be plenty of them.

232
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,060
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I know there'll be plenty of them.

233
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,720
Speaker 0: It's not like there's gonna be this perpetual shortage forever.

234
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:54,140
Speaker 0: But the thing is the Wii is selling like crazy and it's gonna keep selling like crazy for a long time and it's pretty much Probably going to be all told the number one console in terms of people who own one.

235
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,963
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

236
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:57,512
Speaker 0: DS is still ahead cut well home console.

237
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:01,193
Speaker 0: The DS is separate the DS is special All right, and PC doesn't count either.

238
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:01,960
Speaker 0: So think about that.

239
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:10,879
Speaker 0: basically Nintendo now is going to have the number one and the number two in terms of Units out there with people who will buy games in the world

240
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:19,129
Speaker 1: Which means game companies the third parties despite their hating of Nintendo will be forced to Make games for the Nintendo systems in order to.

241
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:22,840
Speaker 0: I do point out though a lot of franchises that shy away from Nintendo.

242
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:38,886
Speaker 0: I You also see a lot of those really crappy third-party people who make as many Gameboy and Wii games as they can possibly make at every possible moment every license every franchise every cats dolphins pigs whatever the next game is and every kids cartoon.

243
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:46,790
Speaker 0: you've ever heard of even the really obscure ones and I gotta say I think they have a much better racket going than a lot of these.

244
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:47,533
Speaker 0: I don't know.

245
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,006
Speaker 0: I'm a like Activision when they're like, oh, yeah, Nintendo consoles.

246
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,816
Speaker 0: We don't dig that anymore We don't it's not our bag.

247
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:57,310
Speaker 1: Well video games is a really weird situation like the market right now.

248
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,099
Speaker 1: I mean look look at the movie theater.

249
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,325
Speaker 1: right the movie theater.

250
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:01,309
Speaker 1: You've got these people.

251
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:08,743
Speaker 1: They're spending lots and lots of money on Movies that are large, you know, not all of them but blockbuster movies.

252
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:10,210
Speaker 1: They're generally mass appeal.

253
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:15,824
Speaker 1: You know low brow or lower brow than typical, but I'm quite low brow All right.

254
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,635
Speaker 1: Generally low brow on average.

255
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:27,303
Speaker 1: big budgets big profits big on the special effects and the fanciness of the mass appeal Right in in the art house movie theater.

256
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:39,121
Speaker 1: You've got the low budgets Relatively higher brow right more critically acclaimed type stuff only going out to a smaller You know group of people in the video games.

257
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:48,414
Speaker 1: You've got these high budget high production Typically higher brow more complicated video games going out to the smaller Hardcore market.

258
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:59,210
Speaker 1: and then you've got these low budget low brow Mass appeal things going out to the mass market and it's totally backwards and I wonder if it's ever going to correct it.

259
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:06,964
Speaker 0: So, I mean if you want to make money in video gaming for real and you're not really cell phone games Like we just said is where the money's not just cell phone games shit game.

260
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,135
Speaker 1: Yeah make a Tetris clone You'll make more money.

261
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:13,817
Speaker 0: make little crap games buy yourself a franchise License to whatever thing you think.

262
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:20,690
Speaker 0: kids you make more money with diner - than you will with Halo 4 That's for sure, especially because you could do diner - in a weekend by yourself.

263
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:33,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even if Halo 4 makes you know hundreds of millions of dollars diner - can also make hundreds of millions of dollars and diner - only took one guy like an hour to make and maybe you Hired an artist for a few thousand dollars.

264
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:41,016
Speaker 0: But one interesting thing that is coming out of all this is that Reggie came out and basically said all right bundlers Listen up.

265
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:42,463
Speaker 1: Oh, I hate those bundlers.

266
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:49,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm seeing this in the city because you know a Lot of people at my work are trying to get wheeze and can they go to the Nintendo store?

267
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,520
Speaker 0: They can they just they can't get.

268
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,529
Speaker 1: it got one last year with me.

269
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,930
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, yeah, but So this is one kind of high-brow.

270
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:00,897
Speaker 0: Oh the hoity-toity fancy.

271
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:04,830
Speaker 0: people will shop here electronic store right in Midtown and I walked out of that efficient.

272
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:08,727
Speaker 0: Might have I don't remember hate that efficient because I walk by this place.

273
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,753
Speaker 0: I see in the window It's got like it's red.

274
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:23,370
Speaker 0: They have a pile of like 30 wheeze and you can buy them for like $500 because they come with a million absolutely useless bundled things that no one wants.

275
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,055
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the big money.

276
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:29,790
Speaker 1: if you're a retail store selling game consoles, you don't make too much money on the console.

277
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,239
Speaker 0: Oh, you may jack off in the car.

278
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,910
Speaker 1: You don't make too much money on the games.

279
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,290
Speaker 1: That's why they pre-orders that they can maximize their you know game selling profit.

280
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,930
Speaker 1: You think most of the money on the used game walls this you don't make most of your money on the used games.

281
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,559
Speaker 1: Well, you make the profit margins.

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,830
Speaker 1: the margins are biggest on the used things and the accessories.

283
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:57,674
Speaker 1: so when someone sells that we you know that the The reason that you would sell wheeze is because someone coming in to buy a we obviously doesn't have one yet and they're gonna need Some accessories.

284
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,080
Speaker 1: they're gonna need some extra controllers.

285
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,406
Speaker 1: They're gonna need some memory cards.

286
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:01,310
Speaker 1: It's gonna be whatever right?

287
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:11,630
Speaker 1: So the problem is a lot of third-party accessories out there that people don't normally buy a lot of or there are the unnecessary Accessories that just don't do it.

288
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,725
Speaker 1: Yeah That's some third-party company made this accessory that no one wants and no one needs.

289
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:18,828
Speaker 1: or this is unpopular Games that no one wants and no one will buy.

290
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:24,294
Speaker 0: though I got to say I saw an accessory that wallet is definitely dumb and not something I would get Whoever made.

291
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,578
Speaker 0: this is brilliant.

292
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:31,809
Speaker 0: It's this third-party thing and it cost quite a bit of money and it is the accessory kit for Wii Sports.

293
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:42,017
Speaker 0: All it is is a little tennis racket that goes around your remote a little golf club that goes around your remote and a little Baseball bat that goes around your remote.

294
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,386
Speaker 1: They have a little bowling ball that the remote goes into now.

295
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:46,073
Speaker 1: boo sucks Anyway.

296
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,324
Speaker 1: or a boxing glove no boxing glove.

297
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:53,370
Speaker 1: Oh fuck that, okay But you know, they make the biggest margins on those things.

298
00:20:53,612 --> 00:21:07,610
Speaker 1: so if you've got say 50 wheeze and you're not gonna get any more wheeze because there's so few of them being made only 1.8 million per month in the world You want to sell as many accessories as possible along with those wheeze because that's the way to make the most money.

299
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,386
Speaker 1: So they put them all in a box with a bunch of accessories and they say If you want to buy the Wii you got to buy all this other shit.

300
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:23,920
Speaker 0: You don't want Now, uh, I wonder I don't think Nintendo has any sort of power over this because while Reggie said, uh, we've contacted them Whatever He didn't say anything specific.

301
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:26,470
Speaker 1: and also how do these gonna say anything specific?

302
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:28,238
Speaker 0: Cuz I don't think Nintendo is gonna do anything.

303
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:29,403
Speaker 0: There's nothing they can do.

304
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:31,130
Speaker 1: I think with Nintendo capitalism.

305
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:47,407
Speaker 1: No, I think what Nintendo will do is if you know retailers are being really egregious with their you know We bundling and Nintendo doesn't like it Nintendo will Decrease the supply of wheeze to read those retailers and think they won't care to other retailers because they're.

306
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,090
Speaker 0: it's almost Christmas Anyway, and the boom is gonna pretty much not die, but go back to normal right after the holiday.

307
00:21:53,150 --> 00:22:03,046
Speaker 1: But meanwhile GameStop slash EB is a is a very egregious bundler, but Nintendo apparently is doing this nice Raincheck deal with them.

308
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,079
Speaker 1: So Go Nintendo.

309
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:06,127
Speaker 0: I was about to talk about that.

310
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:19,347
Speaker 0: last all right, there's a Nintendo announced a we rain check program and basically if anyone buys a we through this program through I think Any time in December, they'll be guaranteed a we before the end of January.

311
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,050
Speaker 1: not bad.

312
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:34,716
Speaker 0: So hopefully that could kind of fuck all the people who are bundling things because maybe grandma might be smart and say alright Jimmy I couldn't get you a we But I got you this piece of paper that guarantees you a we and I got you a bunch of games to play as Soon as your week comes.

313
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:35,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good.

314
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:36,348
Speaker 1: That's good.

315
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:46,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other thing is that you know All the economist analyst people are saying that Nintendo is losing money because of all the people who want wheeze But can't get one because yeah supplies too low.

316
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,663
Speaker 0: Now the thing is who wants a we now and it doesn't get one?

317
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:53,950
Speaker 0: who isn't just gonna get one in February?

318
00:22:54,412 --> 00:23:11,164
Speaker 1: well, I think that there's some people that not a number greater than zero of People who because they can't get a we for the kid or whatever on the holiday They had they feel as if they have to get something and they don't want to get the kid a piece of paper because that Makes them, you know feel bad because they're consumer materials tours.

319
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:14,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, and They're gonna go out and buy something else.

320
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,005
Speaker 1: maybe an Xbox that you see but here's the thing.

321
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:24,290
Speaker 0: maybe a TV maybe the Fairly certain maybe an iPod just knowing people that anyone who does that the we is gonna get purchased eventually.

322
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,415
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know.

323
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:35,589
Speaker 1: I think there are a number of people who they buy for the holidays But I got something and they're not gonna get the we don't forget because then the kid Maybe next year look at the way the kid will be happy because he got a gift.

324
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:37,999
Speaker 0: But come February when all his friends have wheeze.

325
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,666
Speaker 0: How come I don't have a wee mom.

326
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:43,342
Speaker 0: Ah Zelda mom Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda.

327
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:44,688
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

328
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:45,210
Speaker 1: We'll see.

329
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,150
Speaker 1: I don't think I don't think it's gonna beg too much of an impact, but I think that is gonna hurt them some it.

330
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,980
Speaker 0: Well, it's not actually going to hurt them.

331
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,749
Speaker 0: I don't think is it they already made?

332
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:59,881
Speaker 1: well No, they're not gonna suddenly be in the poor house or anything, but they they potential money They could have made if they could have see I don't.

333
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:00,785
Speaker 0: I think it's negligible.

334
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:03,558
Speaker 1: I think it's absolutely Could have met the we demand.

335
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:06,330
Speaker 1: they would have made a lot more money than if they then did they are now.

336
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,970
Speaker 0: I think the only reason that is true is because having money now is worth more than having money later.

337
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:14,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's more dude.

338
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:19,010
Speaker 1: I don't think I think the the people who analyze these things who are experts no more than you.

339
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what the people who analyze it.

340
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:24,106
Speaker 0: the articles I read didn't say Nintendo's gonna lose Jack.

341
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:35,430
Speaker 0: all what they said is Basically Nintendo's profits are going to be delayed because of this and Nintendo could have another billion Right now by the end of the year that they're not gonna have just because they can't sell them fast enough.

342
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,956
Speaker 0: But they'll have it for next quarter.

343
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:37,799
Speaker 0: So won't matter.

344
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,843
Speaker 1: Let's see if they have.

345
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:41,836
Speaker 1: I don't think they'll have a billion next quarter But anyway, not a billion.

346
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:42,098
Speaker 0: They're not.

347
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:45,975
Speaker 1: they don't have to worry about billion monies either way They don't have to worry about monies.

348
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,902
Speaker 0: That's we're not gonna sell a billion ways.

349
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,869
Speaker 1: a billion ways of ends.

350
00:24:57,057 --> 00:24:58,385
Speaker 0: Ah Anyway things the day.

351
00:24:58,426 --> 00:25:01,680
Speaker 0: let's not talk about Nintendo or wheeze for at least a couple months.

352
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,242
Speaker 1: All right It'll probably be a while because there aren't gonna be any games coming out for a while and I still got to beat all the ones We just get.

353
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:09,214
Speaker 0: yeah, we haven't even talked about Mario Galaxy yet.

354
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:09,978
Speaker 1: I haven't beat it.

355
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,311
Speaker 1: I laid it a whole bunch then I stopped playing it.

356
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:16,427
Speaker 0: I feel as though I should review Simon's quest now that I'm playing it again.

357
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:18,858
Speaker 1: No fucking awesome sucks, right.

358
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:21,889
Speaker 0: anyway The other day we were looking for stuff.

359
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,320
Speaker 0: for some reason we ended up talking about Ross Perot.

360
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:27,660
Speaker 0: So I start YouTube it I find videos of Ross Perot.

361
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,480
Speaker 0: We watch him talking about some intelligent things and some crazy things and NAFTA and you know being Ross Perot.

362
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,704
Speaker 0: And then you know, we're about to finish up Maybe go get some dinner.

363
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:47,117
Speaker 0: and we noticed that in the related videos section of something We looked at related to Ross Perot at some point Was what looked like a but and rim of course could not help but click on the.

364
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:52,595
Speaker 0: but well not right away We look at it in the titles in Japanese and I'm like, is that a but?

365
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,240
Speaker 0: and everyone looks at it says yeah I think that's a but but I thought we couldn't have butts on YouTube.

366
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:58,646
Speaker 0: I thought there was no policy.

367
00:25:58,686 --> 00:25:59,530
Speaker 1: tube is but free.

368
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,780
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a sham, but I wonder what it is.

369
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,472
Speaker 0: so we zoom in Emily starting to read the Japanese and I just go screw it.

370
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:11,377
Speaker 0: I click on it and What I saw what I watched was something that did involve butts, but they were sham butts.

371
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:12,159
Speaker 0: They weren't real butts.

372
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:13,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, what comes out of a sham?

373
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:19,748
Speaker 1: but Shampoo, oh man The joke made one person laugh.

374
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,360
Speaker 1: so hope someone listening left at my shampoo joke.

375
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:34,383
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how to describe this but it's a Japanese cover with the Numa Numa song melody but it's the lyrics are kind of like a Potomac party.

376
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:46,891
Speaker 0: and show me your butt and there's sham butts and this epic guy with an epic mustache and an epic leather jackets and It's crazy goodness, I don't know what to say about this.

377
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:49,159
Speaker 0: I think it's kind of awesome and I'm not sure why.

378
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:50,905
Speaker 1: No, you got anything else to say.

379
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:51,948
Speaker 0: watch it.

380
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,811
Speaker 0: Oh god.

381
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:54,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's worth watching at least once.

382
00:26:55,078 --> 00:27:00,220
Speaker 1: funny video Alright, so, you know that guy Greg kostickian who I've become more a fan of lately.

383
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:05,637
Speaker 1: He's the guy who made the paranoia RPG and he runs the manifesto games and he has this new blog.

384
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:13,175
Speaker 1: play this thing Which I've mentioned before which is an awesome blog everyone should read and on that blog He mentioned this RPG that he wrote.

385
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:22,160
Speaker 1: I guess Basically some RPGs out there aren't actually meant to be played like a hall human occupied landfill.

386
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,880
Speaker 0: That is read that the rules to that game and they're fantastic.

387
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,968
Speaker 0: It is a hilarious book.

388
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,720
Speaker 0: play that game and you're stupid.

389
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:31,897
Speaker 1: It is something because an RPG is really just a book.

390
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:44,007
Speaker 1: I said, you know but it's a book that contains rules among but also other things and There seems to be this art of making RPGs where you don't even need to actually Play the game you could.

391
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:47,239
Speaker 1: just the book itself is is the enjoyable part, you know?

392
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,480
Speaker 0: Well, even when I was really young before I found people who would play D&D with me reading those D&D books was great.

393
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:54,858
Speaker 0: I would just pour over him.

394
00:27:55,354 --> 00:28:02,140
Speaker 1: Yeah So they sort of people they make RPGs on purpose that aren't meant to be played or I guess they technically could be played.

395
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:07,299
Speaker 1: But it's not really Going to be realistic or fun or interesting to play it.

396
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:11,216
Speaker 1: But the reading the book and reading the rules is entertaining usually humorous.

397
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:24,889
Speaker 1: So He made his game called violence the role-playing game of egregious and repulsive bloodshed and I'm not gonna describe the game any more than that.

398
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,257
Speaker 0: It's it's probably all you need to know.

399
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:30,070
Speaker 1: It's not a game That's really meant to be played.

400
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,859
Speaker 1: I guess you could play it.

401
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:37,479
Speaker 1: But reading it is quite humorous and quite awesome and it's a free PDF.

402
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:47,434
Speaker 1: So if you like the RPGs and maybe if you can laugh it, you know stupid violence jokes then this is for you and it's free.

403
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:53,595
Speaker 0: so I Realized recently that we never really talked about this game in any depth on the show.

404
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:54,097
Speaker 0: I don't think.

405
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:57,934
Speaker 1: no Well, I thought we talked about it kind of but I guess not.

406
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:03,697
Speaker 1: so let's who cares Even if we did a whole show on it before whether we did or didn't we're doing a show on it now.

407
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:05,062
Speaker 1: screw you St.

408
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:11,743
Speaker 1: Petersburg as in the Russian city not as in I guess the Florida City All right.

409
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,192
Speaker 1: Let me I can sum this game up real quickly.

410
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:14,553
Speaker 1: You ready?

411
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:15,697
Speaker 1: It's a game.

412
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:16,500
Speaker 1: It's a card game.

413
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,345
Speaker 1: There is a board.

414
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:24,406
Speaker 1: the version you can buy now has a board and some other pieces but it's basically just a card game, but that also has money and You have money.

415
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:30,372
Speaker 1: at the beginning of the game you buy cards Cards either give you money or points.

416
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:32,360
Speaker 1: Your goal is to get points.

417
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,203
Speaker 1: That's the whole game.

418
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:40,620
Speaker 0: It's a growth management game in that there are multiple kinds of resources money and points.

419
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:46,680
Speaker 0: Yep, you want money in the first part of the game because you need enough money to bankroll your point getting later in the game.

420
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:58,250
Speaker 1: Yeah If you just start out at the beginning of the game buying points or cards that get you points you will have no more money and you will not be able to get any more points and then You will be done and while other people

421
00:29:58,712 --> 00:29:58,833
Speaker 0: who

422
00:29:58,873 --> 00:30:04,091
Speaker 1: might buy things they get that money But then never buy any points will end up with just fistfuls of money and no points.

423
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:09,069
Speaker 0: and on the I guess on the surface That's pretty much how this game is.

424
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:09,310
Speaker 0: Yeah,

425
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:29,520
Speaker 1: you're trying to balance your Expenditures of money so that over the course of the game you continue to get enough money to buy as many points as you can but not too many points because then you won't be able to buy any buy any more and you'll actually get less than you think You were gonna get or not too much money because then you could have bought points instead of you know buying money.

426
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:49,420
Speaker 0: So like I said a growth management game But the way it plays out is actually fantastic and while the game Eventually will break down as all board games do when you play it enough times I think the core concepts of this game and this is kind of important I think we'll talk about this at the end too could be used I believe to great effect in other kinds of games.

427
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a game where every mechanic in the game.

428
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,380
Speaker 1: Is it an amazing?

429
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:09,480
Speaker 1: Beautiful perfectly executed game mechanic and all the mechanics work together very well But the resulting game just isn't a game that is strategically deep But all the mechanics of the game are great game mechanics that you know should be used in many other games to great effect.

430
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:16,995
Speaker 0: And the game is slightly strategic and very Tactical at least up until the point where you and all your friends have figured the game out completely.

431
00:31:17,035 --> 00:31:20,609
Speaker 1: and then the game is also Fun, even if you four sort of figured it out.

432
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:21,493
Speaker 1: I have fun playing st.

433
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:26,436
Speaker 1: Petersburg, even though I know exactly what to do And you don't even need to play the first turn because it's automatic.

434
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:30,092
Speaker 0: at this point Sometimes the first several turns are basically automatic.

435
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:35,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no seriously I think it speaks very well of this game this Rio Grande hands on.

436
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:45,236
Speaker 0: look game that Despite the fact that I feel as though our group has solved it and that winning basically comes down to Do the good Jews come up early on or do they come up later?

437
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:45,296
Speaker 0: Oh?

438
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,278
Speaker 1: All right, so you want to go in a little more depth to explain what the Jews are.

439
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,680
Speaker 0: well It's not just Jews there's also chairs and squares.

440
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:55,839
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's four kinds of cards in the game.

441
00:31:56,261 --> 00:32:03,100
Speaker 1: There's the green worker cards which are the chairs because the symbol on them is a chair Or it looks like a chair and whether it's a chair or not?

442
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,360
Speaker 0: I don't get a card with a chair on it, and you get a little wooden chair yes.

443
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,559
Speaker 0: And then there's the buildings which are primarily the point generation things aka the Kremlin.

444
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,088
Speaker 0: yeah The green is a little Kremlin simple.

445
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:14,980
Speaker 1: the green workers mostly give money.

446
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:16,392
Speaker 1: They're your primary source of money.

447
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:20,852
Speaker 1: the blue Kremlins are your primary source of points, but they can sometimes give money.

448
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:25,199
Speaker 0: now the squares are the upgrades And it's just a big square.

449
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,431
Speaker 1: Yeah, those aren't actually things you can buy on their own.

450
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:32,969
Speaker 1: you have to upgrade existing things with them And it lets you get really powerful stuff.

451
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:35,540
Speaker 0: now the last kind of card is the nobility.

452
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:42,731
Speaker 0: they're orange, and they give you money and points and Extra bonus points at the end of the game which are very important.

453
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:45,020
Speaker 0: now you might have noticed that I didn't say nobility.

454
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:46,185
Speaker 0: I said something else.

455
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:46,466
Speaker 0: now.

456
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:51,363
Speaker 0: Scott actually pointed this out when we first started playing but I'll link to this.

457
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:53,809
Speaker 0: here's a picture of the four symbols from the game.

458
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,920
Speaker 0: now guess which one is the nobility and then from there?

459
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,328
Speaker 0: I want you to pay attention to certain features.

460
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:00,890
Speaker 0: it may have.

461
00:33:02,307 --> 00:33:05,278
Speaker 1: It's Jewish possibly possibly.

462
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:09,032
Speaker 0: So we're playing this game for the first a second time.

463
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:11,770
Speaker 0: I think because I played it at a con once I didn't even think of this.

464
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,355
Speaker 0: and then Scott pulls up the thing and he's like all right time to draw the Jews.

465
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:19,724
Speaker 1: yeah I'm Jewish.

466
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:20,447
Speaker 1: That's what they are.

467
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:20,708
Speaker 1: There's.

468
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:20,929
Speaker 1: no.

469
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:24,726
Speaker 1: I mean actually they're all Russians technically But Russian Jews.

470
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:31,310
Speaker 1: the icon that represents the nobility is it has a really big nose It's and it makes lots of money.

471
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,240
Speaker 0: I cannot help but assume that this is intentional.

472
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:35,084
Speaker 1: I can't.

473
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:35,968
Speaker 1: I can't assume anything.

474
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:36,973
Speaker 0: There is no way.

475
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:43,360
Speaker 1: This is not intentional all right, so Is there anything else really say about this game?

476
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,340
Speaker 0: I mean the way the game plays out is you know the cards.

477
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,753
Speaker 0: You'll go through four phases and every player you can play up to four.

478
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:51,340
Speaker 0: the game works kind of okay with three.

479
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:54,858
Speaker 0: It's kind of broken with two, but you can play it, but four is what you want to be.

480
00:33:55,542 --> 00:34:03,818
Speaker 0: Everyone will have one of these tokens and then every round of the game You do the workers and then the buildings and then the aristocrats and then the squares.

481
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,611
Speaker 0: yep and the way you do it is there's.

482
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:11,958
Speaker 0: the cards are laid out on the board and Basically you fill the board up with cards of whatever phase it is.

483
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,313
Speaker 0: Then people can buy cards going round robin till their hearts content.

484
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:20,972
Speaker 0: once everyone has passed Then you score all the things that points of that type.

485
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,440
Speaker 0: so in the worker round you put out workers.

486
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:28,239
Speaker 0: Then you buy workers, but you can buy other stuff, but then you score only workers.

487
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,995
Speaker 0: You might have bought a Kremlin or a square But you're not gonna be able to get anything from those things.

488
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:35,683
Speaker 1: right and any You know.

489
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:36,568
Speaker 1: and if no one?

490
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:40,667
Speaker 1: but if something is put out on the board and no one buys it It just kind of sticks around for a while.

491
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:45,145
Speaker 1: and that means so it let's say we the board is empty And it's the Kremlin round.

492
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:48,538
Speaker 1: so you put out a whole row of kremlins and maybe half the kremlins get bought.

493
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,962
Speaker 1: okay The other half of the kremlins stay on the board and then we deal out the aristocrat Jews to fill up the other half Of the board.

494
00:34:55,222 --> 00:35:00,420
Speaker 1: so if you want more Jews to get drawn from the deck you'll buy more kremlins.

495
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:07,020
Speaker 0: You see now this creates a very interesting even odd left-right mechanic to the game.

496
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,960
Speaker 0: We haven't talked a lot about left-right mechanics.

497
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:09,445
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

498
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:14,091
Speaker 0: we haven't reviewed a lot of those games But a lot of modern German style games.

499
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:23,229
Speaker 0: try to avoid the left-right phenomenon whereby The you have more of an effect or lesson of effect Game-wise on the person to your left or right.

500
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:24,292
Speaker 0: just by the way the game works.

501
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:27,612
Speaker 0: usually because to make things simple a lot of games Just go clockwise.

502
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:32,779
Speaker 1: yep I mean you know in any game where it's okay take your turn and the person to the left takes their turn.

503
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:43,595
Speaker 1: in Some of those games depending on the rules The person to your right might have a big advantage over you and you'll have a big advantage Over the person to your left, and then so on and so forth.

504
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:51,020
Speaker 0: now sometimes This is balanced very well But a lot of times it's just because it would have made the game too complex or not fun to play to skip the whole.

505
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:53,226
Speaker 0: Just go clockwise Mechanic.

506
00:35:53,246 --> 00:36:02,740
Speaker 0: so a lot of older German games Have this problem where if I sit to the left or the right of Scott Matters a lot and how the game is gonna turn out in the end El Grande had this problem.

507
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:10,693
Speaker 1: Yeah for example if I'm gonna sitting down to play this game and I know that you have an advantage over the person to your left and A disadvantage to the person to your right

508
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,300
Speaker 0: I want to say Someone who's bad at the game

509
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:21,007
Speaker 1: I will sit to the right to the left of the newbie and I will sit to the right of rim to damage him the And I'll probably win if I do that.

510
00:36:21,107 --> 00:36:26,679
Speaker 0: now this game gets around that in that you deal out the rolls Randomly at the beginning of the game.

511
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:33,644
Speaker 0: So I might start with the workers or I might start with the Jews or I might start with the Kremlin's or I might start With the square.

512
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,491
Speaker 1: is the square sucks in the first round.

513
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:42,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but at the same time I feel like you get an advantage in the long run for that, but it depends too because you do it randomly.

514
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:43,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

515
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,000
Speaker 0: So clockwise counterclockwise the order that the things are in is random.

516
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:59,645
Speaker 0: And then after every set of four rounds before you start a new turn to use the old D&D around versus turn Everyone passes their little fetish their little token to the left Mmm, and then you continue.

517
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:03,837
Speaker 0: so if Scott has the Jews he's on my right and then I have the Kremlin's.

518
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,854
Speaker 0: I passed the Kremlin's To the person on my left and Scott gives me the Jews.

519
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:10,628
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so basically the the the.

520
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,116
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, I guess I didn't finish how that were the why.

521
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:14,220
Speaker 0: that's the even odd mechanic.

522
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:15,757
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess not.

523
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:25,359
Speaker 0: So since you're drawing cards and buying cards and you only fill up say the Kremlin's when the Kremlin round starts Let's say no one buys any workers the workers thing stays full.

524
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:33,860
Speaker 0: Well, then it's my turn to do the Kremlin's and because I'm the one whose turn it is I get first pick of the Kremlin's and whoever has the chair gets first pick of the workers.

525
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:38,180
Speaker 0: If no Kremlin's come out, I kind of lose that advantage.

526
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:41,923
Speaker 0: So I kind of especially with Jews But I'll get to why.

527
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:42,587
Speaker 0: that's the reason.

528
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:50,456
Speaker 0: if I want a square or a Kremlin or whatever I have to make sure that at least enough of them will be put out to where.

529
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:52,926
Speaker 0: if everyone buys one I will be able to buy one.

530
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:55,560
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, let's say there are three players, right?

531
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,415
Speaker 1: And uh rim is to my left and he currently has the chair.

532
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:08,415
Speaker 1: That means Let you know that if I want to get a worker Which is the chair there needs to be at least three empty spaces on the board.

533
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:14,030
Speaker 1: if there's only two empty spaces And then we deal out two new workers rim buys one.

534
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:19,828
Speaker 1: the next person buys one if they want to which they probably will I will not get one.

535
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,756
Speaker 1: there will not be one there for me to buy it.

536
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:22,660
Speaker 1: how much money I have.

537
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:35,080
Speaker 1: So that gives me a strong incentive to buy a square or some other card Before that part of the game comes around so that there will be three open spaces meaning I can get a worker now.

538
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:44,480
Speaker 1: But once I open the third open space since the game goes around and around and around so everyone's done rim can then Buy another card opening up a fourth space.

539
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:48,680
Speaker 1: So he'll get two workers and each of us will get one and so on and so forth.

540
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:58,619
Speaker 1: So there's sort of this you trying to buy things to leave a good number of open spaces so that you will get The right number of you know new cards available to you.

541
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:04,000
Speaker 1: But you don't want to buy a bunch of useless crap just to be able to have the opportunity to buy useful crap later.

542
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,530
Speaker 1: Cuz then you're losing all your money on stuff that doesn't do anything.

543
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:22,357
Speaker 0: now this in addition to the Jew mechanic Which we'll get to and in addition to the hand which I'll also get to right now Actually adds a fairly Significant amount of tactical depth to the game mm-hmm even though it's a very simple set of tactics.

544
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:35,400
Speaker 0: at the same time you can buy a card or take a card or not buy a card and Force someone else to now have to buy a suboptimal card to get the thing that they know they need in the next round.

545
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:44,172
Speaker 0: There's definitely this game if you are fighting with other players to make sure you get exactly what you need every round and that the math All works out, and it's really not all that complicated.

546
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:49,580
Speaker 1: once you sort of play the game a couple times You know the hang this thing out the hand any any time.

547
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,810
Speaker 0: It's your you're sitting there, and it's your action.

548
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,634
Speaker 0: cuz you just keep going around.

549
00:39:52,694 --> 00:40:04,497
Speaker 0: Robin all right I can buy a card or I can pass or I can take a card for free Into my hand, but you can only hold so many cards in your hand as a limit of three cards.

550
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:09,802
Speaker 0: yep now I've denied someone else that card and I can buy it from my hand anytime I want.

551
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:17,179
Speaker 0: so at any point when I could just buy a card from the board at any turn instead I can say no, I'm building this card from my hand.

552
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:23,020
Speaker 1: yep So for really awesome card the the basic strategy with the hand is this a really awesome card comes out.

553
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:26,300
Speaker 1: You have a chance to buy it because you can go first or whatever.

554
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:32,000
Speaker 1: You know that someone else is gonna buy that if you let it go But you don't have enough money to buy it yourself.

555
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:35,760
Speaker 1: So you pick it up and put it in your hand thus keeping it safe and buying it later.

556
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,607
Speaker 1: That's the basic strategy of the hand.

557
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:41,100
Speaker 1: It's also not the best strategy of the hand, but it is there.

558
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:43,996
Speaker 0: Well what you want to do beyond that is you also have to look at.

559
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:49,320
Speaker 0: well I need to make another card get drawn in the worker phase, so I got to buy another thing.

560
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:50,893
Speaker 0: But I don't want any of these buildings yet.

561
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:51,740
Speaker 0: It's too early in the game.

562
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:54,699
Speaker 0: I'll just take that library into my hand.

563
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:56,298
Speaker 1: Take the car into your hand.

564
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,515
Speaker 1: now There's an open space which means another card is gonna get dealt and the even-odd game.

565
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:01,859
Speaker 1: you win that right now.

566
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:13,033
Speaker 1: You don't have to spend any money right now And you took a card into your hand that would have otherwise maybe disappeared from the game And you can buy it later when if it would have shown up later.

567
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,660
Speaker 1: You would have bought it anyway now.

568
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:25,236
Speaker 0: Then again now you have the problem of I've already drawn two cards into my hand if I draw a third card And then some opportunity comes up later where I would need to draw a card.

569
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:28,709
Speaker 0: I can't Mmm, and the game is just.

570
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,576
Speaker 0: it's really fun as a result.

571
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:31,820
Speaker 0: with all this all right.

572
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,000
Speaker 1: So the worker cards are primarily a way to get money.

573
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,722
Speaker 1: You know the.

574
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:36,424
Speaker 1: you buy them.

575
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:37,608
Speaker 1: they give you money.

576
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:40,457
Speaker 1: the Kremlin's are primarily cards to get you points.

577
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:41,400
Speaker 1: you buy them to get points.

578
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:44,773
Speaker 1: The Jew cards the aristocrats the nobles whatever.

579
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:54,975
Speaker 1: they give you money but they cost a lot more than the workers and They usually give you less money than the workers, so it's kind of like why would you buy them?

580
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:56,640
Speaker 1: well some of the more expensive?

581
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,520
Speaker 1: Aristocrat cards give you money and points which a few other cards do that as well.

582
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:16,460
Speaker 1: But that those are really powerful cards and the game is actually sort of broken where if those cards show up right at the beginning Of the game then someone can get them buy them right away And then sort of win and there's not much anyone else could do about it unless they get similarly powerful cards.

583
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:26,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much if the second biggest Jew in the normal deck comes up in the first round whoever gets that card is 95% likely to win the game.

584
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,354
Speaker 0: you might as well.

585
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:27,897
Speaker 1: just stop there.

586
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:28,480
Speaker 1: a total nub.

587
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,060
Speaker 1: But even if they are a total nub they might win because it's so that powerful.

588
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:40,267
Speaker 1: So a lot of people play with a rule where you reshuffle the cards if one of those powerful cards comes up in the first Turn, but anyway the.

589
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:42,333
Speaker 1: so why buy these aristocrat cards?

590
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,600
Speaker 1: Why are they so great if you know?

591
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,653
Speaker 1: They don't get you that much money, and they cost a lot, and they don't get in.

592
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:50,580
Speaker 1: only the really powerful ones are really powerful.

593
00:42:51,921 --> 00:43:01,295
Speaker 1: The reason is this in addition to the points you get for buildings that give you stuff all the time You get points at the end of the game for the number of unique aristocrats.

594
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:08,110
Speaker 1: so for example at the end of the game I have five Authors authors, which is the lowest level aristocrat.

595
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:10,038
Speaker 1: that doesn't do much for me.

596
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:21,253
Speaker 1: now let's say I have an author a judge a building designing guy a The lady in waiting or mistress of something whatever his name is.

597
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:24,803
Speaker 1: I forget mister some ceremony misters of ceremonies And the comptroller.

598
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:27,832
Speaker 1: right that's five different aristocrats.

599
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:30,399
Speaker 1: right there's a little table on the board.

600
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,344
Speaker 1: now This doesn't happen all the time, but at the very end of the game you look at that table Just once.

601
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:40,962
Speaker 1: I have five unique different named Aristocrats.

602
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:46,140
Speaker 1: you get a crap ton of points all at once and that's usually the thing that means winning and losing.

603
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:51,680
Speaker 0: So you've got the one method of generating points where you get you build buildings earlier is better generally.

604
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:55,407
Speaker 0: And so say I build a building you give me two victory points Every round.

605
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:58,585
Speaker 0: for the rest of the game I get two victory points And I start pulling ahead.

606
00:43:58,665 --> 00:44:05,719
Speaker 1: so buying that card earlier in the game gets you more points But buying it later in the game is probably a lot easier to afford it.

607
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:12,026
Speaker 1: So it's pretty tough because buying it earlier on might mean you don't have enough money to get more money because you need money to Make money.

608
00:44:12,168 --> 00:44:12,999
Speaker 1: that's the rule of the world.

609
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,035
Speaker 1: Capitalism yep, but buying it later on when you have money you can afford to buy it.

610
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,098
Speaker 1: you get less points out of it.

611
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:27,248
Speaker 0: now There's some other fun things like if you buy a building that you are any card that you already have out in front of you You get a one discount for every one.

612
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:27,951
Speaker 0: you have right.

613
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:31,700
Speaker 1: so if I buy an author an author cost $4 Then another author shows up.

614
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,014
Speaker 1: I can buy that author for $3.

615
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:36,504
Speaker 1: if another author shows up I can buy it for $2 now.

616
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:37,346
Speaker 0: what all this?

617
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:39,152
Speaker 0: what this and all these kind of?

618
00:44:39,172 --> 00:44:39,593
Speaker 0: you know?

619
00:44:39,633 --> 00:45:01,340
Speaker 0: people generally want different cards just Depending on their situation, but the game seems to be set up to cause people to desire Cards sometimes the same card sometimes different cards and as a result creates a lot of tactical Situations that if the game were even slightly less complex would not be there at all and the game wouldn't be in any way enjoyable.

620
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:10,003
Speaker 1: I think the only other mechanic in the game is that If a card sits out on the board and no one buys it it eventually goes to the bottom half of the board where it's A dollar cheaper.

621
00:45:10,063 --> 00:45:16,510
Speaker 1: so even if I have two authors an author comes out that could cost me usually two dollars But no one else wants it.

622
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:17,659
Speaker 1: it goes to the bottom of the board.

623
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:20,360
Speaker 1: now It cost me one dollar and now I have three authors.

624
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:26,460
Speaker 1: And you can you know by penny pinching like that and by biding your time you can really save a lot of money.

625
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,907
Speaker 1: But then you got to think about it though.

626
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:35,380
Speaker 1: if I would have bought that author a turn earlier sure it would have cost me An extra dollar, but the author would have given me an extra dollar from being in my pile for you know.

627
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,404
Speaker 1: So it's tough.

628
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,211
Speaker 1: It's tough all right.

629
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:40,460
Speaker 0: We could talk a little bit about how to win at the game.

630
00:45:40,661 --> 00:45:41,584
Speaker 1: I think that's what we should do.

631
00:45:41,644 --> 00:45:48,860
Speaker 1: first of all if the judge or the mistress whatever comes up in the first turn or the Comptroller the comptroller is pretty close.

632
00:45:48,961 --> 00:46:08,993
Speaker 1: But any of those three incredibly powerful Aristocrat cards that give you points and money if any of those show up early in the game either buy them immediately Or pick them up put them in your hand and then buy them as soon as you can afford them Because you will make a zillion points and a zillion dollars and win and no one Really hard for anyone to stop you unless they do the same thing.

633
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:13,225
Speaker 0: to buy Workers always buy workers.

634
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:15,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, as many as you can there.

635
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:20,805
Speaker 0: There is almost I could take pretty much in the last Two rounds of the game.

636
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:27,927
Speaker 0: or when you might not want to be buying workers you want to buy as many workers as you can Every time the opportunity presents itself.

637
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:31,938
Speaker 1: yes workers generally all the workers give you three dollars a turn.

638
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:32,278
Speaker 1: right.

639
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,992
Speaker 1: well The most expensive worker is the shit.

640
00:46:35,032 --> 00:46:39,392
Speaker 1: the well the most expensive worker We're gonna talk about is the ships the ship making guy.

641
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:39,653
Speaker 0: Well.

642
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:40,717
Speaker 0: There's one other one.

643
00:46:40,737 --> 00:46:51,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I know we're gonna talk about him, and he cost seven dollars, so if you buy him even on the first turn That's a good deal because the game is a lot longer than three turns.

644
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:54,485
Speaker 1: That's going to make you a lot of money It's worth it.

645
00:46:54,666 --> 00:47:00,320
Speaker 1: and once you buy one ship guy Every other ship guy will cost you a dollar less, and there's a lot of them.

646
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,471
Speaker 1: so the second ship guy will cost you six.

647
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:03,657
Speaker 1: the next one will cost you five.

648
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:10,952
Speaker 1: the four there and The only time you don't want to buy a worker pretty much is like Let's say there's two turns left in the game.

649
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:16,977
Speaker 1: right and I know that the game well you can tell when the game is gonna end because it ends when one of the four decks of cards runs out.

650
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:34,797
Speaker 1: so if one of the decks is really close to running out and I think the game is gonna end in two or three turns and I don't have any shipbuilding guys and They cost seven and one comes up then buying one might be a bad idea because it'll cost me seven and the game Probably won't last three turns for me to make a profit

651
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:35,179
Speaker 0: now, too.

652
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:38,838
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna tell you what round this is likely to happen in.

653
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:53,587
Speaker 0: likely it's pretty much guaranteed to happen unless you're playing with total nubs, but There there's a round where everything get reshuffled and you'll notice that a whole bunch of cards fall off the board after the square phase and a whole bunch of workers come out.

654
00:47:54,109 --> 00:48:05,580
Speaker 0: you should be able to anticipate when this is going to happen and Have saved money so that you can buy all the workers that your idiot friends Didn't have money for because they didn't realize this would happen.

655
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, because generally the game starts and when the game starts they put out what it let's say is a three-player game You put out what.

656
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:18,513
Speaker 1: six workers or yeah Yeah And if it's a four-player game you put out You know eight work appeal by workers and then it fills up with Kremlin's.

657
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:20,160
Speaker 0: people buy some stuff fills up with you know.

658
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:26,704
Speaker 0: Then in the next round a lot of those cards go to the bottom half of the board where they're discount because no one can Afford them in the first round.

659
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:29,135
Speaker 0: They didn't have enough money and no one wants him in the second round.

660
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:30,300
Speaker 0: So they're going away.

661
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:46,040
Speaker 1: Yep so only a few workers come out in the second round but then in the third round a whole bunch of workers come out usually and this is the time when people finally have money because it's already been two rounds and Now there's a whole bunch of workers available.

662
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:54,389
Speaker 1: So you this is the time you have to if you don't have money at this point in the game To buy as many workers you possibly can you lose.

663
00:48:54,429 --> 00:49:04,260
Speaker 1: basically because if you don't have money and you spent it on something else Everyone else is gonna buy a whole bunch of workers and you buying one less worker.

664
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,611
Speaker 1: You might think oh I bought one less worker than those other guys.

665
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:07,717
Speaker 1: They got one extra worker.

666
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:08,340
Speaker 1: Not a big deal.

667
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:13,700
Speaker 1: That's three money times the number of turns left in the game, which is a lot a whole lot.

668
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:23,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically at any point know how many workers you have and know how many workers everyone else playing has if you were ever Down by more than one at any point.

669
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:24,410
Speaker 0: You're done.

670
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:25,293
Speaker 0: It's over.

671
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,677
Speaker 0: You've lost pretty much.

672
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,040
Speaker 1: cuz you know There'll be five turns left in the game.

673
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,204
Speaker 1: That's fifteen dollars.

674
00:49:30,285 --> 00:49:34,440
Speaker 1: fifteen dollars can buy you something that gets you like six points per turn.

675
00:49:34,982 --> 00:49:37,733
Speaker 1: Six points per turn times five turns of thirty points.

676
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:39,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

677
00:49:39,078 --> 00:49:42,380
Speaker 1: Good job Good job, not having that worker not having that money in the third round.

678
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,501
Speaker 0: Yep, now it's not just with workers there.

679
00:49:44,642 --> 00:49:56,260
Speaker 0: there's a cycle where if there are points in the game where all four commodities will suddenly be out there in force and you'll Be able to buy a whole bunch You should be able to anticipate when this will happen and be ready for it.

680
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:02,023
Speaker 0: If it is the kind of card you want to capitalize on yep to the Jews Pretty much.

681
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:06,200
Speaker 0: you should always take a unique one the more rare it is.

682
00:50:06,522 --> 00:50:08,560
Speaker 0: You should do whatever you have to do to get it.

683
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:11,167
Speaker 0: Just put take in your hand deny it to other people.

684
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:13,895
Speaker 0: look at what other people need and take them.

685
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,139
Speaker 0: you already have three authors.

686
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:18,337
Speaker 0: Take the fourth one so that Joe can't get one.

687
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:20,565
Speaker 1: Yep I mean you look at the.

688
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:29,022
Speaker 1: I've played this game a lot of times and hardly ever has anyone won without getting a significant number of the unique Aristocrats.

689
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:43,060
Speaker 0: you can win and not letting it and you also have to prevent other people from getting the unique Much as you can with a two or possibly three Aristocrat difference down as long as you have got the buildings to back it up.

690
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,380
Speaker 0: But that is difficult to do and if you're down by more than three.

691
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,088
Speaker 0: It's over because the there's.

692
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:50,600
Speaker 0: there are increasing returns for having more aristocrats.

693
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:54,071
Speaker 1: It's incredibly like if you have seven you get a bunch of points.

694
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:56,960
Speaker 1: you have eight you get a lot more points for having eight.

695
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,793
Speaker 1: It's a ludicrous number of points.

696
00:50:58,813 --> 00:50:59,700
Speaker 1: when I look at the scale.

697
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:07,834
Speaker 0: There's a building an observatory and it lets you basically Buy like look at cards from whatever pile you want early and purchase them.

698
00:51:08,436 --> 00:51:10,905
Speaker 0: you might think well I should use that on the aristocrats.

699
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:14,357
Speaker 0: at every opportunity to get more aristocrats early in the game.

700
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,240
Speaker 1: use it on the worker.

701
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:17,195
Speaker 1: Yes Good God think about it.

702
00:51:17,215 --> 00:51:18,222
Speaker 1: you get an Extra.

703
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:21,735
Speaker 1: workers are hard to get early in the game because they're only so many to get dealt out.

704
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:24,567
Speaker 1: if you take a worker Extra early in the game.

705
00:51:24,587 --> 00:51:27,700
Speaker 1: That's three dollars times the number of turns left in the game you win.

706
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:29,768
Speaker 0: There's another building the one that.

707
00:51:29,808 --> 00:51:32,539
Speaker 0: what's the one that let the pub the pube the old boob.

708
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:36,220
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, it lets you pretty much just turn money directly into points.

709
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:46,140
Speaker 1: So if you have lots of extra money and you're having a hard time Getting the cards to get you lots of points The pub is a good way to just turn your money into a lot of points.

710
00:51:46,945 --> 00:51:48,743
Speaker 1: If you can't do it any other way I will say this.

711
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:53,100
Speaker 0: there's a way to know pretty exactly how much you should put into the pub at any given time.

712
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:58,440
Speaker 0: the simple thing to remember is Later in the game is a better time to be putting money in the pub.

713
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:01,094
Speaker 0: Yeah early and you're putting money into the pub early in the game.

714
00:52:01,275 --> 00:52:02,100
Speaker 0: You're doing it wrong.

715
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:10,078
Speaker 1: Yeah at the end of the game if you're playing well You should have so much money that you can buy every single card that's worth buying and then money left over and that's the money That goes in the pub.

716
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,505
Speaker 0: Now go for combos.

717
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:14,231
Speaker 0: try to get like four customs houses.

718
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:23,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I try to do is early in the game I'll only I'll pick like either the markets or the customs houses or one type of building and then I'll buy as many of that Building as I can.

719
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:35,634
Speaker 1: so I spend very relatively little money and get a lot of points building up throughout the game And then I have as many workers as I can obviously And then I spend all my money trying to get a bunch of different aristocrats use.

720
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:44,840
Speaker 0: make sure Every round where aristocrats will come out that enough will be drawn to where you have the opportunity to buy one.

721
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:58,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're gonna be the fourth person to have an opportunity to purchase Aristocrats make sure there are four empty spaces on the board at the end of the Kremlin round so that four Aristocrats get dealt out at least now This is doubly so for workers.

722
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:04,890
Speaker 0: if you're going to have the chair next round meaning the chair is to your right and is Going to pass to you and it's a four player game.

723
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:11,373
Speaker 0: You want there to be Exactly five spaces or one if possible.

724
00:53:11,493 --> 00:53:15,126
Speaker 1: Yes, or you know, perhaps Yeah, five is optimal.

725
00:53:15,187 --> 00:53:18,520
Speaker 1: five is optimal because then you can buy two workers and everyone else can only buy.

726
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:24,839
Speaker 0: However, if you didn't listen to us, you don't have enough money to buy two workers then for the love of God Don't let two workers come up.

727
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,360
Speaker 1: Yeah Because then the guy to the left of you will be able to buy two workers without having to do anything and then all he owns.

728
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:36,799
Speaker 0: Yeah Remember any time you do not take it around he'll get two workers again because he'll have the chair from you any time.

729
00:53:36,819 --> 00:53:39,910
Speaker 0: you do Not take advantage of a situation to deny someone else something.

730
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:42,560
Speaker 0: you've given it to them and that is worth a lot to them.

731
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:43,023
Speaker 0: Yeah here.

732
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:43,807
Speaker 1: I found the scale.

733
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:46,944
Speaker 1: if you have seven different Jews It's 28 points.

734
00:53:47,406 --> 00:53:48,611
Speaker 1: eight different Jews is 36 points.

735
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,294
Speaker 1: nine is 45 points.

736
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,780
Speaker 1: So it's it's sort of a one plus two plus three plus four plus five.

737
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,111
Speaker 0: You can win this game nachi scale as a dark horse.

738
00:53:57,252 --> 00:54:01,769
Speaker 0: That's not the right scale right with almost entirely Aristocrats and not much else.

739
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:02,150
Speaker 1: Yes.

740
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:04,360
Speaker 1: That's Fibonacci is the right one right now.

741
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:07,585
Speaker 0: I'd even listen to you.

742
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:08,410
Speaker 0: I'm trying to wrap this up.

743
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:10,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is gonna be a long episode.

744
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,205
Speaker 0: We got it curse.

745
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:11,648
Speaker 0: Luckily.

746
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:12,634
Speaker 0: The game's kind of solved.

747
00:54:12,694 --> 00:54:13,680
Speaker 1: It's close to Fibonacci.

748
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:15,325
Speaker 0: Let's see.

749
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:17,040
Speaker 0: What else is really important to winning this game?

750
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:20,768
Speaker 1: Playing it a few times to get the feel.

751
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:23,819
Speaker 0: All right in terms of knowing how like what?

752
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,220
Speaker 0: Worker to buy like you see a bunch of workers, which one do I buy?

753
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:30,512
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna tell you exactly because it's you can.

754
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:32,260
Speaker 0: basically you could be done by an algorithm.

755
00:54:32,623 --> 00:54:39,377
Speaker 0: You should be able to look at any possible set of workers in front of you and workers on a board in a game of st.

756
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:46,877
Speaker 0: Petersburg and Not only know exactly which one you should buy but know exactly which ones every other player will buy.

757
00:54:46,937 --> 00:54:53,882
Speaker 1: you can calculate this Perfectly, I mean it's sort of obvious because you pretty much everyone always wants to buy the cheapest possible worker They can buy.

758
00:54:54,404 --> 00:55:02,037
Speaker 1: and if there is two workers that cost equal amounts to you because that's very possible By the one that you know, someone else really wants.

759
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:04,639
Speaker 1: thus They'll be forced to spend more on the workers.

760
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:06,540
Speaker 0: I and there's other things to it.

761
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:13,992
Speaker 0: But basically you should get to the point where you can look at the workers and know exactly Like the worker phase should be automatic.

762
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:15,840
Speaker 0: You shouldn't even have to play that phase.

763
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,230
Speaker 0: Everyone should just take the ones they know they'll get and pay their money.

764
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:20,420
Speaker 1: Yep, especially in the first round.

765
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:21,999
Speaker 1: But we play the first round of the game.

766
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:28,200
Speaker 1: We basically turn over the number of workers then see who goes first and then we just deal them out because we know exactly who?

767
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,959
Speaker 1: Wants which ones and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

768
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:36,520
Speaker 0: Start with six extra money because we know that everyone's going to have two workers and get six money at the end of that phase.

769
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:36,721
Speaker 0: Yep.

770
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,208
Speaker 1: All right.

771
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:38,891
Speaker 1: Are we done?

772
00:55:39,614 --> 00:55:40,016
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

773
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:43,828
Speaker 0: I mean beyond that Upgrades by the Jews.

774
00:55:44,149 --> 00:55:45,194
Speaker 0: don't buy the buildings.

775
00:55:45,395 --> 00:55:46,560
Speaker 1: Well, some of the buildings are okay.

776
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:58,689
Speaker 0: So my buildings opportunistically, yeah Do not ever buy a building if you could have gotten with unique aristocrat instead with the upgrade cards in general You are basically only trying.

777
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:04,560
Speaker 1: the only reason to get the upgrade cards is because there are unique Aristocrats in there that cannot be gotten any other way.

778
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,580
Speaker 1: So you want to have lots of like authors or administrators?

779
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:15,540
Speaker 1: extra duplicate administrators duplicate authors so that you can upgrade them to say Popes because there's only one Pope in the game.

780
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:21,442
Speaker 1: So if you don't have if you have an author only one and you upgrade it to the Pope you still only have one unique Aristocrat.

781
00:56:21,703 --> 00:56:22,405
Speaker 1: give two authors.

782
00:56:22,425 --> 00:56:23,428
Speaker 1: you upgrade one to the Pope.

783
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:28,700
Speaker 1: now you have two unique aristocrats and it's a huge jump in points and also buying that one aristocrat.

784
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:34,556
Speaker 0: even if you have a duplicate you get the Discount and then you've denied someone else because a lot of the higher level ones.

785
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:37,445
Speaker 0: There aren't so many in the game No and they're not guaranteed to come out there.

786
00:56:37,525 --> 00:56:37,746
Speaker 1: other.

787
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:45,969
Speaker 1: to upgrade workers is usually a good idea earlier in the game because it allows you to get a sort of a continuing supply of points without diminishing your supply of money at all.

788
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:50,515
Speaker 1: and The upgrade buildings are sort of something you buy opportunistically.

789
00:56:50,555 --> 00:56:50,756
Speaker 1: like you.

790
00:56:50,776 --> 00:56:54,840
Speaker 1: don't go for them Unless you really try to win without the the aristocrats.

791
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:04,316
Speaker 1: But if let's say you have a building and an upgrade building comes out and it only cost you like one to get it Right and it'll give you like a whole bunch of money or something.

792
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:04,557
Speaker 1: Sure.

793
00:57:04,618 --> 00:57:05,020
Speaker 1: Why not?

794
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,513
Speaker 1: You know, it won't hurt but I've never seen anyone win really big with those.

795
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:15,129
Speaker 0: now the last and most important thing And this is pretty much the key to victory pajamkins village.

796
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:17,315
Speaker 0: Well, you should always buy pajamkins village.

797
00:57:17,395 --> 00:57:18,016
Speaker 0: Yeah always.

798
00:57:18,077 --> 00:57:39,855
Speaker 0: but beside that When it there is a point in the game where you will have to make a conscious shift from Money generation as your focus to point generation as your focus That is the round where it you might even forego the aristocrats or whatever But suddenly you spend all your money on the library or something some big point building.

799
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:50,227
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm doing that Right before everyone else does it gives you a 75% chance of winning but doing it a tiny bit early ruins you because you won't have enough money.

800
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:54,203
Speaker 1: and doing it a tiny bit late means everyone else got it before you and they Got more points than you.

801
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:58,880
Speaker 0: I've had very good success winning against people who aren't the front row crew.

802
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:04,600
Speaker 0: I played this game with a million times by switching to point generation in the third or fourth round.

803
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:08,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, you you basically the first part of the game get as much money as you can.

804
00:58:09,481 --> 00:58:33,379
Speaker 1: right and because everything keeps making stuff as the game goes on you buy money now, you'll have money forever and Then at the exact right moment when you know You have enough money making resources to power you through the rest of the game just buy stuff that makes points as much as you possibly can and then that'll make you the most possible points of the rest of The game and that that could add up to like 30 40 points over the course of the whole thing.

805
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:41,360
Speaker 0: And I guess eventually you'll solve the game because you know Like we said, there's a few problems with balance in terms of if the early aristocrats come up big.

806
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,420
Speaker 0: But also like we said the game is super fun Even if you're playing it with three people who are playing optimum.

807
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,115
Speaker 1: I mean we've gotten to the point where we don't even really need to play the game like.

808
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:56,540
Speaker 1: we can just sit down deal the Cards out and I can tell you exactly what everyone is going to do on their turns.

809
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:59,976
Speaker 1: You know as long as they're all skilled players to know what they're doing.

810
00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:04,360
Speaker 1: I'll be like you're gonna do this You're gonna do this you're gonna do this and I know exactly what everyone's gonna do and I'm not wrong.

811
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,380
Speaker 1: They'd like yes, I was gonna do that because there are only really two dark horse.

812
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:17,598
Speaker 0: There's the it's kind of like halas has this where there's the way to win and then there are the two dark horse Ways to win and beyond that every other strategy is suboptimal.

813
00:59:17,879 --> 00:59:26,285
Speaker 0: Yep It's not a strategic game because you choose between the way to win and the slightly less likely ways to win and it's all just Tactics and numbers.

814
00:59:26,586 --> 00:59:28,535
Speaker 0: you got to keep all the numbers in your head all the time.

815
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:29,720
Speaker 1: It's a super fun game.

816
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,700
Speaker 1: It's a super great game.

817
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:40,457
Speaker 1: It's super awesome game in every way except for the fact that eventually after playing it a lot You will just know exactly what everyone's gonna do and there's no real decisions going on right.

818
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,712
Speaker 0: and on that note I'm gonna go make some case ideas.

819
00:59:43,076 --> 00:59:52,298
Speaker 0: All right This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

820
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:54,484
