1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,895
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 2nd, 2013.

2
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:10,357
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,884
Speaker 0: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,302
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:17,027
Speaker 1: Camping.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,327
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,739
Speaker 1: So today at work I was killing some downtime on the old tweeters.

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,800
Speaker 1: And basically Conrad and I came up with a brilliant business proposition.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Speaker 1: And I feel like you could turn this into a real, not so much a business, but at least a funny or cool app.

10
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:38,319
Speaker 1: Okay.

11
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:39,639
Speaker 1: Homeopathic iTunes.

12
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:41,760
Speaker 0: Alright.

13
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,268
Speaker 1: So think about this.

14
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:43,853
Speaker 1: I was making a joke.

15
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:47,919
Speaker 0: They give you money and you give them some bits but it's not an app?

16
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:55,800
Speaker 1: A dude who was selling basically dowsing rods as bomb detectors was arrested and is going to jail for a long time.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,267
Speaker 0: Hooray!

18
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:01,220
Speaker 1: So I was musing on why we don't arrest all the other people selling homeoepithes.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,920
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people selling that kind of shit.

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,879
Speaker 1: I know and they should probably all be in jail.

21
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:05,339
Speaker 0: That's right.

22
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:11,500
Speaker 1: But I made some jokes about homeopathy and then kind of realized something.

23
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,619
Speaker 1: Say we started selling homeopathic music and the way you do it is...

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,620
Speaker 0: It's like a second of music?

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,540
Speaker 1: It's just iTunes but it gives you just a tiny snippet of music and just a little, maybe even just the cover art.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,040
Speaker 1: And it assumes that if you've seen that music before, you'll remember it and play the song back in your head.

27
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:34,080
Speaker 0: Alright.

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
Speaker 1: And thus getting a percentage of the effect of listening to the real song.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:47,339
Speaker 1: Like if I see a picture of Michael Jackson and the word Billie Jean, even just the words Billie Jean, I hear a few pieces of Billie Jean repeating over and over again in my head for like the next 20 minutes.

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,200
Speaker 1: So basically homeopathic music kind of works.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,120
Speaker 1: Or in the very least it works way better than actual homeopathy.

32
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:05,840
Speaker 1: Also Billie Jean is my example because two days now I've gone to the Taco Shed by Brooklyn Bridge.

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,960
Speaker 1: And both times there's been these dudes who hang out and do mediocre breakdancing and they always do the same set.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Speaker 1: Every day at noon they do Gangnam Style and then Billie Jean.

35
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,600
Speaker 0: I was on the train just now and the dancing guys were in the next subway car over.

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,379
Speaker 0: I peeped them through the window.

37
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,488
Speaker 1: Gangnam Style?

38
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,360
Speaker 0: Billie Jean?

39
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,380
Speaker 0: I couldn't hear their music at all because they were in the next subway car.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,299
Speaker 0: It was a loud subway and I had my headphones in.

41
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:35,420
Speaker 0: They looked real derpy just sort of dancing with no music doing their grab onto the subway bar flipping around stuff.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,780
Speaker 0: It looked very uncoordinated with no rhythm whatsoever.

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:48,200
Speaker 1: Well living in New York, much like how you learn pretty quickly, the majority of people with instruments anywhere in public don't actually know how to play shit.

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,360
Speaker 1: And they just kind of doodle enough to where if you walk by and you're not really paying attention, it sounds like they're playing music.

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,599
Speaker 1: I think the majority of breakdancers on the streets of New York City are the same way.

46
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:00,931
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's Thursday.

47
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,000
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

48
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:02,760
Speaker 0: It's your mom.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,559
Speaker 1: Care to talk about anything on the loan?

50
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:06,334
Speaker 1: No.

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,420
Speaker 1: The geek nudge lounge?

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,233
Speaker 0: I'm boycotting the lounge.

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,387
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

54
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,500
Speaker 0: We just kind of hang out and talk.

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
Speaker 0: Just stop calling it the lounge.

56
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,039
Speaker 1: What are you going to talk about then?

57
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:14,679
Speaker 1: I got nothing.

58
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,179
Speaker 0: No, I got nothing actually.

59
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:17,180
Speaker 0: You really have nothing?

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,908
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

61
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:18,559
Speaker 0: I have a cough.

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,280
Speaker 0: I was coughing in the morning.

63
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,038
Speaker 0: I woke up and I was like BK.

64
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:23,340
Speaker 0: Shit.

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,980
Speaker 1: I wonder how many Monday listeners know why we say BK instead of bike.

66
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:36,475
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember we got an email from a dude in like 2006 who was like, "Guys, it's pronounced Chipotle, not

67
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:36,979
Speaker 1: Chipotle.".

68
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,197
Speaker 1: And we had to be like, "Yeah, we

69
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:39,500
Speaker 1: know.".

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also Clash of the Titans.

71
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,640
Speaker 1: So you admit that it's actually Titans and that you just do that because it's funny.

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,457
Speaker 0: What did I just say?

73
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,560
Speaker 1: All right, Scott.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,860
Speaker 1: So what's the name of the song?

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,592
Speaker 1: I believe it's "Have You Never Been

76
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:51,915
Speaker 1: Mellow?".

77
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:53,940
Speaker 0: What song are you talking about?

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,717
Speaker 1: The song in DDR, "Have You Never Been

79
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:55,960
Speaker 1: Mellow?".

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,838
Speaker 0: I've never heard of that song.

81
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,159
Speaker 1: I see what's going on here.

82
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,140
Speaker 1: So I got something I want to talk about.

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
Speaker 0: I actually just listened to that song today.

84
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,659
Speaker 1: I just danced to that song a few days ago.

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,559
Speaker 1: DDR is my thing.

86
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:09,380
Speaker 0: I'm in a DDR mood, do not deny.

87
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:20,620
Speaker 1: For those of you who weren't alive and conscious enough in the '90s, the '80s to remember this, let alone people are old enough to remember actual anarchists.

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:35,899
Speaker 1: May Day is a day every year where basically morons in Western countries will, and particularly in places like Seattle, Toronto- California, all of it.

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,160
Speaker 1: Will basically protest nothing.

90
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:40,977
Speaker 0: Yep.

91
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:41,898
Speaker 0: The man.

92
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,700
Speaker 0: It's people- They're protesting the man.

93
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,840
Speaker 1: Who are ostensibly anarchists of some stripe, or maybe they're anti-corporatists or whatever.

94
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,140
Speaker 1: They're all the same kinds of people with the same weirdo talking points.

95
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,699
Speaker 1: Like, take the people who did Occupy Wall Street and go one step crazier.

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,339
Speaker 1: Exactly one step.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,679
Speaker 0: It doesn't really get crazier than contrail guy.

98
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:04,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, chemtrail guy is way beyond all of that.

99
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,860
Speaker 1: It's like a separate spectrum.

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Speaker 1: But there's a particular class of people who will do the Occupy thing in that kind of derpy way that they do their thing.

101
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:14,980
Speaker 1: One step beyond that is the self-described anarchist.

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,320
Speaker 1: Basically, it's the equivalent of hipsters who pretend to be into politics and live on the West Coast.

103
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:24,040
Speaker 0: They're really about equivalent to Ron Paul guy in my book.

104
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:29,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've never understood what they actually want, what they're actually after.

105
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,619
Speaker 1: Don't think they know about anarchy.

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,920
Speaker 1: At best, they're like the anarchists in Chesterton's book, The Man Who Was Thursday.

107
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,960
Speaker 0: Right, they're basically anti-current society and they just want to fight against it.

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,660
Speaker 0: So the first thing that comes along that is a replacement, they latch onto it and that's their thing.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,540
Speaker 1: But what's even funnier is that one step beyond them are the guys who are "anarchists" in quotes.

110
00:05:53,241 --> 00:06:06,660
Speaker 1: But they pretend to be old-timey anarchists and they actually wear bandanas and are ready to fight the cops and basically provoke fights with riot police without fail every year on May 1st.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:20,670
Speaker 1: And every time there's a G7 or a WTO conference, they show up, they break a bunch of windows of Starbuckses, they try to flip over cars, as soon as the police come anywhere near them, they start screaming, "The man, the man, they're getting me!

112
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,918
Speaker 1: I'm going to sue you for arresting

113
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:21,999
Speaker 1: me!".

114
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,491
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah.

115
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:25,880
Speaker 1: And in the 90s, this was always in the news.

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
Speaker 1: It's basically not in the news anymore.

117
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:33,920
Speaker 1: My news is just to show people who don't pay attention that this still happens.

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:49,109
Speaker 1: And it's kind of hilarious because at least in the 80s and in the early to mid-90s, because there wasn't an internet like we know today, this stuff would make the mainstream news and you could kind of understand at least.

119
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,940
Speaker 1: these are people who have a thing and this is the only way they can get attention.

120
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:59,000
Speaker 1: But there's really no excuse for this bullshit anymore and no one sides with them at all anymore.

121
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,230
Speaker 0: Well, they side with themselves.

122
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,059
Speaker 0: There's more than one of them.

123
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,805
Speaker 0: There's not just one guy.

124
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:06,260
Speaker 0: There's still these two guys and they side with each other, so that's who sides with them.

125
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,720
Speaker 1: To quote one of them, "They're just doing what they need to do to stand up for ourselves.

126
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,555
Speaker 1: These are our streets and we have the right to take

127
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:12,797
Speaker 1: them."

128
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,820
Speaker 1: Says the guy who basically breaks some Starbucks windows and then screams that he's getting arrested.

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 0: I don't think you have a right to break the Starbucks windows.

130
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,540
Speaker 0: The Starbucks window is not part of the streets.

131
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:30,260
Speaker 1: So, if you're not aware of this subculture, take a gander at this article because the headlining picture says everything.

132
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,678
Speaker 1: Two totally normal police, but because it's Seattle, they're bicycle police and they're just dragging away.

133
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:49,940
Speaker 1: this guy who looks like he deserves to be dragged away and/or tased and has the exact face that people like this tend to have when they're being arrested for doing their absolutely nothing wrong that they were doing.

134
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,805
Speaker 1: So, that's all I got to say.

135
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:54,500
Speaker 1: If you're not aware of these morons, this is all kind of funny.

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,420
Speaker 1: And this is coming from someone who thinks we should be doing protests for things like this, but actually about real things.

137
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,585
Speaker 0: What are they protesting even?

138
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,213
Speaker 0: They're just protesting the man.

139
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,800
Speaker 0: They don't have a specific thing.

140
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,400
Speaker 1: Protesters began throwing metal rods and water bottles at officers and business windows.

141
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,760
Speaker 1: And then the officers walked in and just started arresting them.

142
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,710
Speaker 0: In protest, you gotta be Gandhi style.

143
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,720
Speaker 0: If you're throwing shit, it's like, well, fuck you.

144
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,660
Speaker 1: You can throw shit in certain situations, but I can even rationalize certain kinds of violent protests.

145
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:37,159
Speaker 1: However, that's neither here nor there because nothing related to the May 1st WTO anti-globalization protest for the last 20+ years has been even close to reasonable.

146
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:38,957
Speaker 0: No.

147
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,200
Speaker 0: Alright.

148
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:46,290
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

149
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,740
Speaker 1: I used to be a big fan of these sort of things.

150
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:59,879
Speaker 1: Especially in the early anime-con days, like the fake trailer to a movie, like the fake trailer to Evangelion, or take a movie trailer and mash it up with an anime or something like that.

151
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,360
Speaker 1: This is a gritty movie trailer, and these people seem to have done several, but this one's probably the best one.

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,940
Speaker 1: Basically, they make fake movie trailers that are the gritty reboot of X. Because that seems to be what Hollywood does lately.

153
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,900
Speaker 0: And you do a gritty reboot of something that's already gritty?

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,683
Speaker 1: That'd be pretty cool.

155
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,332
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

156
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,740
Speaker 1: I would do a gritty reboot of Batman.

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,634
Speaker 1: It's just Batman going, "I'm not the hero that Gotham

158
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:24,358
Speaker 1: wants!".

159
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,326
Speaker 1: And then it's just him, Hannibal Lecter.

160
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:30,160
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is a gritty reboot of Calvin and Hobbes.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:42,360
Speaker 1: And the reason I make this my thing of the day is that it's not only well done and apt in many ways, but if this were a real movie, I would actually consider watching it once it came to Netflix.

162
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,213
Speaker 0: Calvin and Hobbes mixes seem to be very popular lately.

163
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:54,520
Speaker 0: I mean, they've been popular always, but lately, I think the frequency in which new ones appear has been increasing steadily.

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,419
Speaker 1: I think it's partly because the people who grew up reading Calvin and Hobbes all have money and professional lives now.

165
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,786
Speaker 1: And media production got easier.

166
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:08,219
Speaker 1: And you can't make anything legit related to Calvin and Hobbes, but you can totally make parodies!

167
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,702
Speaker 0: Alright.

168
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:10,824
Speaker 0: So check this out, right?

169
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:24,880
Speaker 0: Normally, if you're the kind of person who makes models or miniatures or anything like that, it requires a lot of careful skills to do good stuff, right?

170
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,680
Speaker 0: So it's like, if you got a Gundam or something, you gotta airbrush each piece, and carefully mask off different parts and draw the panel lines.

171
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,640
Speaker 0: Or if you're like a Warhammer, you gotta get a really pointy brush and paint some eyeballs on your orc or whatever, right?

172
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:44,460
Speaker 0: It's all about this careful, high skill, lots of practice kind of work.

173
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,420
Speaker 0: So this guy here has the greatest method of putting damage.

174
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,151
Speaker 0: Damage is a thing that you want to do pretty often, right?

175
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,899
Speaker 0: You want to make a guy look like he got hurt.

176
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,779
Speaker 0: Especially if it's something involved in a battle, right?

177
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,620
Speaker 0: Or maybe you even want to do a car model and make it look like it crashed.

178
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:06,080
Speaker 0: See, he has a Gundam, and he wants to make it look like it's been in a battle.

179
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,516
Speaker 0: He does this in the least skilled way I've ever seen.

180
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,420
Speaker 0: I could even do it.

181
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:16,060
Speaker 0: And it comes out better looking than almost anything I've seen.

182
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,900
Speaker 0: All you have to do after you do his method is basically spray a topcoat on it to seal in the damage so that it doesn't rub off.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,534
Speaker 0: But he has this amazing method of making the kit look damaged.

184
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,440
Speaker 0: that is trivially simple.

185
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,899
Speaker 0: If you've never built a Gundam model before, you can do this.

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,780
Speaker 0: And it looks like a pro did it all carefully by hand.

187
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,940
Speaker 0: So really, anyone who's doing this sort of damage look by hand, you're fucking stupid.

188
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,320
Speaker 0: You can just do it this way, and it comes out looking better and more natural.

189
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:46,280
Speaker 1: Not too shabby.

190
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:50,614
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the Geek Knights Book Club book is Player of Games by Ian M.

191
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:50,855
Speaker 0: Banks.

192
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,260
Speaker 1: I will start reading it today.

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,764
Speaker 0: You know what?

194
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:54,638
Speaker 0: There's a guy in the book.

195
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:55,539
Speaker 1: Let me guess.

196
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,380
Speaker 0: He plays a lot of motherfucking games.

197
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:57,987
Speaker 1: Scott, spoilers.

198
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,680
Speaker 1: Jesus fuck.

199
00:11:59,189 --> 00:11:59,739
Speaker 0: And you know what?

200
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,616
Speaker 0: Even though he plays many different games, mostly there's just one game.

201
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,440
Speaker 0: he plays a whole lot.

202
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,039
Speaker 0: But that game has a lot of sub-games.

203
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,640
Speaker 1: You know, it'd be funny if that game was just Counter-Strike.

204
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,640
Speaker 0: No, it's a fictional made-up game.

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,920
Speaker 0: It might as well be Benjuka.

206
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,680
Speaker 0: It's basically Benjuka.

207
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,360
Speaker 0: Only they describe it a little bit more, but not totally.

208
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,330
Speaker 1: Alright.

209
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,060
Speaker 1: So we uploaded numerous recent lectures from Penny Arcade Expos and the likes.

210
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,679
Speaker 1: You should check out our YouTube channels.

211
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:28,318
Speaker 1: I'll link to them in the thing.

212
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:34,700
Speaker 1: We're going to be at, coming up very soon, Anime Boston doing not one, not two, not three, not four, but five lectures.

213
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,480
Speaker 1: And Emily will also be doing a lecture.

214
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,920
Speaker 1: We're doing a ton of crap there.

215
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,200
Speaker 1: Anime Boston's going to be awesome.

216
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,240
Speaker 1: In the time we're not doing them, we'll either be in the tabletop area or out on Newbury Street eating expensive food.

217
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:50,360
Speaker 0: Or coughing and sneezing or barfing if it's Anime Boston.

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,800
Speaker 1: Not too long after that, we will be at Kineticon helping run and running the panels and workshops department and doing panels and lectures.

219
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:10,040
Speaker 1: And then immediately after that, Scott and I are flying to Land Out Under to present Beyond Dungeons and Dragons 2.0 version beta, all new content at PAX Australia.

220
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:10,840
Speaker 0: Okay.

221
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,158
Speaker 1: I'm pretty excited about this.

222
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:16,040
Speaker 1: And then of course, we're going to be at PAX Dev and PAX Prime and then MAGFest.

223
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:16,939
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

224
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,412
Speaker 0: Yeah.

225
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:22,580
Speaker 1: And we did not submit any panels to Otacon after three years of being blacklisted officially.

226
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,740
Speaker 1: We're not going to bother even trying to submit any words.

227
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:26,919
Speaker 1: Clearly they don't want us there.

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Speaker 1: So if you want us at Otacon, tell them, because it's obvious that us submitting panels.

229
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,260
Speaker 0: Take over Otacon.

230
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:34,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, guys.

231
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,318
Speaker 1: Join the staff.

232
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,979
Speaker 1: Take over.

233
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,600
Speaker 1: That's how we took over Kineticon.

234
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,275
Speaker 1: It's working out pretty well.

235
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,779
Speaker 0: Not going too badly.

236
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:44,620
Speaker 0: Uh, any other meta things?

237
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,338
Speaker 1: No more meta?

238
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,580
Speaker 0: I know the backgammon round of the Grand Prix is almost over.

239
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,400
Speaker 0: Another round will begin soon.

240
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,659
Speaker 0: Not too many people participated in the backgammon round, even though it went pretty well.

241
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Speaker 0: Relatively speaking, the next round is going to be much easier and more straightforward.

242
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,320
Speaker 1: You know, I would have participated in the whole Grand Prix.

243
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,320
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't is that you had a wall of text that I didn't fully read.

244
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,600
Speaker 1: So I missed the registration.

245
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:07,640
Speaker 0: Well, that's important.

246
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,220
Speaker 0: That's part of the thing is if you want to, you have to read the fucking rules.

247
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,559
Speaker 1: And I wasn't willing to do that.

248
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
Speaker 1: So I'm completely out.

249
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Speaker 1: I'm not going to participate.

250
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,439
Speaker 0: Just at all?

251
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:14,708
Speaker 0: No.

252
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,780
Speaker 0: You missed one round.

253
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,040
Speaker 1: I pretty much said that as soon as I was like, Hey, is it too late?

254
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:19,478
Speaker 1: You were like, yep.

255
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,718
Speaker 1: And I'm like, well, I'm out of the Grand Prix.

256
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,979
Speaker 1: I have the chat log to show it, to prove it.

257
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,126
Speaker 1: What?

258
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,219
Speaker 0: You think you can't come back?

259
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:26,440
Speaker 1: I just don't really care.

260
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,160
Speaker 1: It's not, I wouldn't have even had time or effort to do the backgammon round.

261
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,798
Speaker 0: Apparently you didn't even have time or effort to read something, which takes about a minute to read.

262
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 0: So you didn't care that much to begin with.

263
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,759
Speaker 1: No, by the time I read it, it was already too late.

264
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,699
Speaker 0: Why didn't you read it as soon as I put it there?

265
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,839
Speaker 1: Partly because I was busy.

266
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,959
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't take long to read things.

267
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 1: Sometimes it does.

268
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Speaker 0: It seems like I'm the only person in the world who like reads things as soon as they're posted and reads them really, really quickly and reads all the words.

269
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:56,260
Speaker 1: I only actually read our forum once or twice a day at most.

270
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,239
Speaker 1: I don't read every thread.

271
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:02,323
Speaker 0: I don't read every thread, but if there's something I want to read, I'm constantly checking it.

272
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:06,239
Speaker 0: And I read it completely and really, really quickly, like whoosh.

273
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:10,379
Speaker 0: And I read like tons and tons of things really fast all the time.

274
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,840
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

275
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:16,460
Speaker 0: And it's weird that no one else does this because basically it's like, why I know all these things.

276
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,299
Speaker 0: No one knows these things.

277
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:22,340
Speaker 1: I mean, I think it's good for you because I know about things that matter and I don't know about things that don't matter.

278
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,100
Speaker 1: This is why I don't use things like Google Reader because that's more data than I need.

279
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,200
Speaker 0: I don't use Google Reader either, but it's useless.

280
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,739
Speaker 0: I'll read boing boing and I'll just whoosh.

281
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,400
Speaker 0: And I can just scroll down the page in like 30 seconds and basically get all the headlines.

282
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,060
Speaker 1: I do the same thing, but you know what I do that with Google News.

283
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,879
Speaker 0: I do with Google News also.

284
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:47,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can basically read like many, many websites just like tab whoosh, tab whoosh, tab whoosh, tab whoosh in like a minute.

285
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:54,059
Speaker 0: And then if there's articles I wanted, I already clicked on them to open a tab and it takes me about a minute per article to read all the words.

286
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,678
Speaker 1: Good for you.

287
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,000
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is, yes, that's a common skill.

288
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:59,820
Speaker 1: I simply don't consume the same things you consume.

289
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:01,999
Speaker 0: But then it's like, but that is you.

290
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:03,638
Speaker 0: You know, you miss the thing.

291
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,536
Speaker 1: I miss the thing.

292
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,020
Speaker 1: You miss a lot of things.

293
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,979
Speaker 1: I think you're missing my unstated point.

294
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,440
Speaker 1: Wasn't super into the thing to begin with, so I didn't read it right away.

295
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,659
Speaker 1: I only read things I'm super into right away.

296
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,359
Speaker 0: I'm super into everything all the time.

297
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:16,932
Speaker 1: Are you?

298
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,399
Speaker 1: You're into everything all the time.

299
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,560
Speaker 0: What don't I know?

300
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,479
Speaker 1: Why didn't you bike today?

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,640
Speaker 0: Because I'm coughing.

302
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,778
Speaker 1: So you're not super into biking right now.

303
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,060
Speaker 0: If you cared about it, you would have biked.

304
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,560
Speaker 0: I tried to bike and then I went outside and I was like, I went back inside.

305
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:30,406
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

306
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:32,859
Speaker 1: Anyway, so camping.

307
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:36,160
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of, I want to talk about transhumanism.

308
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:37,880
Speaker 1: I got these great show ideas.

309
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,879
Speaker 1: What do you say about transhumanism?

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,698
Speaker 0: You got nothing to say.

311
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,560
Speaker 1: I got about an hour's worth of discussion.

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,339
Speaker 0: I don't have anything to say.

313
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,580
Speaker 1: You seem to forget that, especially on Thursday episodes, listeners don't really care about our specific direct opinions.

314
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,380
Speaker 0: Listeners aren't even listening to this stupid show.

315
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,840
Speaker 1: Or are open, you know, like, oh, let's expound for an hour.

316
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Speaker 0: Nobody listens to this podcast.

317
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

318
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,399
Speaker 1: Your self-deprecating act is kind of old.

319
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 1: You just say the same things over and over again.

320
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,477
Speaker 0: That is true.

321
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:03,059
Speaker 0: As opposed to yourself aggrandizing act.

322
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,400
Speaker 1: What did I say right now?

323
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,118
Speaker 1: We have at least one listener.

324
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:09,378
Speaker 1: So I think I could least extrapolate from that, that there are two.

325
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,099
Speaker 1: So it is okay for me to estimate that I can say listeners.

326
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:21,060
Speaker 0: If you say that because there's one listener, there must be two listeners, then you might as well be, you might get extrapolated as infinity listeners.

327
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,359
Speaker 1: No, because one, the difference between one and two, I mean, look, one, two, three, many.

328
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,699
Speaker 1: So I think there's one of those four.

329
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,098
Speaker 0: I think there's one listener.

330
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 1: Anyway.

331
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:37,400
Speaker 1: So as a result, the thing is, you see what I'm doing there, right?

332
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,138
Speaker 1: Right.

333
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,500
Speaker 0: The thing is, right.

334
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,139
Speaker 0: Suffice to say the thing is right, you know.

335
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,260
Speaker 1: But no, I think the person who does listen to this show is more interested in the banter than in the expounding opinion, especially on Thursday topics.

336
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,800
Speaker 0: That's why we just spent like a good minute, not even completely dodging our topic and killing time saying right, you know.

337
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,460
Speaker 1: That if we may, if we pick a topic, that's just some bullshit.

338
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,297
Speaker 1: We'll just bullshit for an hour.

339
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,999
Speaker 1: We're just bullshitting right now.

340
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,696
Speaker 0: We're not saying anything.

341
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,579
Speaker 1: The way we talk.

342
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,300
Speaker 0: Everyone who's the one listener already stopped listening at this point.

343
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,859
Speaker 1: This is their favorite shit.

344
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,598
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

345
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,779
Speaker 1: Listeners, tell us.

346
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Speaker 1: This is the worst shit.

347
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:18,198
Speaker 1: Every time I have ever turned to the listener and asked him or her what he likes.

348
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,999
Speaker 1: We always get like one email that's like, actually, I really liked the episode you did about blah.

349
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,179
Speaker 1: I don't know why Scott was so down on it.

350
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,380
Speaker 1: That's what the listener sounds like.

351
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,100
Speaker 0: That listener is pretty sad.

352
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,080
Speaker 0: You should be listening to some better podcast or doing something else with your time.

353
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,879
Speaker 0: If you're listening to this right now, that is sad.

354
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,780
Speaker 1: Anyway, guy, would you like us to talk about transhumanism?

355
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,959
Speaker 0: What do we have to say about it?

356
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,431
Speaker 1: Or the surveillance society?

357
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,499
Speaker 1: or urination?

358
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,760
Speaker 0: We've already discussed that.

359
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,920
Speaker 1: Because we already did a show on pooping.

360
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,139
Speaker 1: So urination was also a topic.

361
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,700
Speaker 0: There's a lot less to say about urination than that.

362
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,160
Speaker 1: I got a lot to say about urination, but Scott wants nothing to do with these topics.

363
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:53,459
Speaker 0: I got nothing to say.

364
00:18:54,002 --> 00:19:02,720
Speaker 1: So I've realized that a lot of people I know in the real world have never, ever in their lives been camping in any capacity.

365
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,740
Speaker 0: A lot of these people might be urban peoples.

366
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,578
Speaker 1: But not all of them by any stretch.

367
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,778
Speaker 0: A lot of them are suburban peoples who just don't leave society and go to the woods or anything.

368
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:31,180
Speaker 1: Well, I've realized something because I was kind of thinking about this in light of, for example, the fact that I would say the majority of people I know, until recently, if not currently still don't, don't actually know how to use gears on bikes.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,759
Speaker 0: It's just a common thing.

370
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Speaker 0: Yesterday, when I was biking up the bridge, there was some girl and she was going in the highest possible gear.

371
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:42,718
Speaker 0: And I was actually like, "Hey, you should use some

372
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:43,100
Speaker 0: gears.".

373
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,178
Speaker 0: And she actually wasn't like, "Damn, don't tell me what to do,

374
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:46,540
Speaker 0: whatever.".

375
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:47,348
Speaker 0: She was actually like, "Oh,

376
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:47,874
Speaker 0: okay.".

377
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:49,074
Speaker 1: Did she?

378
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,425
Speaker 1: Yeah.

379
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:50,858
Speaker 0: She did.

380
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,757
Speaker 1: She asked her out.

381
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,138
Speaker 0: No, she wasn't.

382
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,519
Speaker 0: I could tell that she was sort of like, "Oh my gosh.

383
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:58,251
Speaker 0: Let me see

384
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:58,640
Speaker 0: something.".

385
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,680
Speaker 1: So just like Rainbow Dash?

386
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,443
Speaker 0: No.

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,912
Speaker 1: Different kind of, "Oh my

388
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:02,218
Speaker 1: gosh."

389
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,892
Speaker 1: Like, "Let me see

390
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:03,219
Speaker 1: something.".

391
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:12,920
Speaker 1: But I realized that the reason I knew how to shift gears, and I can't say... It's not to fault people who don't because it seems like it's the vast majority of people.

392
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 1: I mean, I just found this article talking about how with all these new bike paths in New York City and the Citi Bike Program, there's classes for adults who never learned how to ride a bike to learn how to ride a bike without being embarrassed.

393
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:31,859
Speaker 1: There's semi-private classes and they're stupidly popular and there's a whole industry now in teaching adults how to ride bikes.

394
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,899
Speaker 1: Then they're teaching like, "Don't fall over.

395
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,478
Speaker 1: Don't fall over.

396
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,257
Speaker 1: Let's take the training wheels off

397
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:38,460
Speaker 1: now.".

398
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,040
Speaker 1: They're not teaching advanced shifting techniques.

399
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,139
Speaker 0: Not everyone grew up riding a bike.

400
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,840
Speaker 1: But even the people who grew up riding a bike often don't know how to shift.

401
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:58,378
Speaker 1: I think the only reason I knew how to shift was that I grew up in a family that had a culture of bicycle riding together in groups and going to the woods and biking through the woods.

402
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,558
Speaker 0: You know how I knew how to shift?

403
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,060
Speaker 0: I had it when I was a kid.

404
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,720
Speaker 0: I had a tricycle.

405
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,180
Speaker 0: Then I had a two-wheel bike with training wheels.

406
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,797
Speaker 1: BMX bike?

407
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,382
Speaker 0: No.

408
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,653
Speaker 0: It was just sort of a little bike.

409
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,039
Speaker 0: Regular bike.

410
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,959
Speaker 1: No gear shifting.

411
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,719
Speaker 1: Coaster brake?

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,333
Speaker 0: Yep.

413
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,620
Speaker 0: But it was, you know, two wheels, whatever.

414
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,500
Speaker 1: Most kids get what is effectively a BMX bike, even if they don't use it for the things that BMX bikes are often used for.

415
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't BMX bike.

416
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,117
Speaker 0: But then, you know, I was biking it.

417
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:26,160
Speaker 0: Then, you know, I got too big for that shit, so I got a 10-speed bike.

418
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,756
Speaker 0: I was like, "Oh, what do these buttons do and switches and

419
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:30,118
Speaker 0: things?".

420
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:36,020
Speaker 0: I looked at the gears and then I've moved them all around and figured out how they worked on my own.

421
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,639
Speaker 0: I'm just like, "This thing's here.

422
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,199
Speaker 0: Clearly, there is a reason for these things to be here.

423
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,578
Speaker 0: I will push them all around to figure it

424
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:42,759
Speaker 0: out.".

425
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,678
Speaker 0: Then I was like, "Oh, if I use these ones, it's harder to pedal, but I go faster if I can pedal.

426
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:52,596
Speaker 0: If I go this way, it's easy to pedal, so I can go up a hill real

427
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:52,938
Speaker 0: easy.".

428
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:57,900
Speaker 0: It was just my natural curiosity and exploration of doing things.

429
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,219
Speaker 0: I noticed there's a different kind of mentality that some people have where they just don't want to touch things.

430
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,137
Speaker 0: They say, "Leave it

431
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:06,380
Speaker 0: there.".

432
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,560
Speaker 1: I think there's one other factor with biking in particular.

433
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:13,120
Speaker 1: I think it's an anti-intellectual attitude that I do not like.

434
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,669
Speaker 1: No, because with biking specifically, it's the fact that most people don't bike in ways that even really need the gears.

435
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,100
Speaker 1: unless you live in the city.

436
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,620
Speaker 0: If there is a hill at all, unless you live somewhere that's 100% flat or on a beach.

437
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,520
Speaker 1: There aren't hills in Michigan at all.

438
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:33,438
Speaker 0: Not even one hill?

439
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:39,220
Speaker 1: It is literally, if you bike in Southeast Michigan, completely flat.

440
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,604
Speaker 0: 100% flat?

441
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,450
Speaker 1: Yes, effectively 100% flat.

442
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:44,600
Speaker 0: Even right next to my house.

443
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,640
Speaker 0: You know what's right next to my house?

444
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,160
Speaker 0: That road.

445
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
Speaker 0: You know that road to hell.

446
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:49,119
Speaker 0: Nothing but hills.

447
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,416
Speaker 1: As a kid, I learned how to use gears and everyone in my family knew how to use gears, but most people I knew didn't.

448
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,240
Speaker 1: The difference was we went biking out in the woods on trails where there were- Hills?

449
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:03,819
Speaker 1: There were basically hills.

450
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
Speaker 1: Because you're out in the woods, there's hills there.

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,779
Speaker 0: See, even if I had been somewhere totally flat, I still would have messed around with the gears and figured out what they did.

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,580
Speaker 1: Oh no, a lot of people messed around with the gears, but they never fully grokked how to use them.

453
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:29,239
Speaker 1: Or even if they grok how to use them, not grok, but they get how to use them in a basic sense, what they don't get is the kind of subtle things that require a little bit of mastery, like exactly how to let up on pressure to shift and then start going again on and uphill.

454
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,389
Speaker 0: Well, if you have a certain kind of gears, you don't need to let off the pressure to shift.

455
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,660
Speaker 1: You don't have those gears.

456
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I do.

457
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,380
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

458
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,960
Speaker 1: You cannot maintain full pressure going up a hill and downshifts.

459
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:42,460
Speaker 0: It depends.

460
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,939
Speaker 1: If you do that, you're basically going to cause a little wear on your gears in the log run and/or fuck your chain up.

461
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,976
Speaker 0: There's one kind of gear that the teeth are different shapes, so you can shift while you're pedaling versus stop pedaling and then shift.

462
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can shift while I'm pedaling, but you still let up on the pressure.

463
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Speaker 0: If you're full force pressure, it's all about the tensioning thing at the bottom.

464
00:24:00,868 --> 00:24:01,040
Speaker 0: Right.

465
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:05,140
Speaker 0: Even then, if that is the limit, then you're in trouble.

466
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:06,140
Speaker 0: But not even then.

467
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,439
Speaker 1: You let up on the pressure slightly whenever you shift.

468
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:10,640
Speaker 0: I've never had any problem.

469
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:18,397
Speaker 1: You're probably not pushing too hard anyway, but it's because I also usually downshift before I get to a hill.

470
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:19,939
Speaker 0: Not on the hill.

471
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,440
Speaker 1: Yes, but if you're going to shift on the hill, you often will.

472
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,659
Speaker 1: For example, I'm in a certain gear, going up the Williamsburg Bridge, jackasses on fixies are blocking the entire way and I have to slow down.

473
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:33,859
Speaker 1: Now I need to downshift on the hill.

474
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,240
Speaker 1: And that happens every morning.

475
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,020
Speaker 0: Don't have that problem.

476
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, bike over the Williamsburg Bridge in the morning.

477
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,120
Speaker 1: There's like a hundred assholes walking fixies up the bridge in both directions.

478
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,759
Speaker 0: Come on, cops.

479
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,560
Speaker 0: Do something about it.

480
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,300
Speaker 1: It's not illegal.

481
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,200
Speaker 0: It should be illegal to have a fixie on the streets.

482
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,900
Speaker 1: It should be illegal to have a fixie on the streets.

483
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,480
Speaker 1: It should not be illegal to have a single gear bike.

484
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:52,259
Speaker 1: That's just dumb.

485
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,491
Speaker 1: Yeah.

486
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,276
Speaker 1: If you see a single gear bike, you smile and nod like, oh, yeah.

487
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,660
Speaker 1: But if you see a fixie, it's like seeing a drunk driver.

488
00:24:58,827 --> 00:24:59,038
Speaker 1: Exactly.

489
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:00,460
Speaker 1: Anyway, not the bike show.

490
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,420
Speaker 1: My point is with camping.

491
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,499
Speaker 1: Everyone I know who knows how to camp and has camped grew up in a family culture of family camping trips.

492
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:19,500
Speaker 1: Everyone I know who has never camped and does not know how to camp did never, never went on a family camping trip because their family was not into camp.

493
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:25,007
Speaker 0: Our family did not have a culture of camping, but we had a culture of send kids to summer camp, which I mean,

494
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,389
Speaker 1: like

495
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:34,860
Speaker 0: when I was a kid, I sort of assumed everyone went to summer camp and only later in life did I realize, oh, only some people send their kids to summer camp and most people fucking don't because they're stupid as shit.

496
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,879
Speaker 0: Now, the thing is, there's a different can't afford it.

497
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,740
Speaker 1: There's a different world in the Midwest.

498
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,960
Speaker 1: The stuff of summer camp is just in the neighborhood.

499
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:45,540
Speaker 0: There are neighborhood summer camps you can go to, but you don't need to go away to camp.

500
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,040
Speaker 1: You just there's just shooting ranges.

501
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,700
Speaker 1: You just go to as kids in the summer and just shoot and there's just archery ranges.

502
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,259
Speaker 1: You just go to just fuck around in the woods and whatever.

503
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:57,380
Speaker 1: So you didn't need to go to camp to get those experiences.

504
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,819
Speaker 0: Summer camp is his own thing.

505
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know you just got you're saying that.

506
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:08,140
Speaker 1: What I'm going to say is that the most people I know for whom summer camp was a thing, like a thing as opposed to just, yeah, I went to summer camp once or twice.

507
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:12,460
Speaker 1: Our kids grew up in Connecticut and New York and New Jersey and almost nowhere else.

508
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,393
Speaker 0: It's a Northeast thing.

509
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:13,799
Speaker 0: I don't know.

510
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,264
Speaker 0: It is.

511
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,260
Speaker 1: I go to the Midwest.

512
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:16,218
Speaker 1: It's not a big thing.

513
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:19,120
Speaker 1: Kids generally don't go to summer camp.

514
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:19,585
Speaker 0: They will.

515
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:20,379
Speaker 0: Summer camp is the best.

516
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:28,684
Speaker 1: They'll go to like week long camps like space camp or science camp or Starbase or programmer camp, but they won't go to.

517
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:32,560
Speaker 1: I am away from home for more than a couple of weeks.

518
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,652
Speaker 0: Eight weeks sleep away camp is should.

519
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:35,740
Speaker 0: every kid should have that.

520
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,660
Speaker 0: In fact, it should be sort of like public school.

521
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,000
Speaker 0: We should have public sleep away camp for eight weeks every summer.

522
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,582
Speaker 1: I don't know.

523
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:42,780
Speaker 1: I think you're too close to it because you grew up in a culture of that.

524
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,836
Speaker 0: Summer camp is the best.

525
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:47,160
Speaker 1: Did not exist where I grew up and I frankly don't think I miss much.

526
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,005
Speaker 0: It's the best.

527
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,200
Speaker 0: You missed a lot more than you realize.

528
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:49,660
Speaker 1: Like what?

529
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:51,240
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the greatest.

530
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 0: That's, you know, there's not this night.

531
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,120
Speaker 0: So like you watch freakin, um, salute your shorts.

532
00:26:59,181 --> 00:27:04,020
Speaker 1: That looks like a horrible existence that I would have avoided at all costs.

533
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:12,439
Speaker 1: My summers were fuck around in the woods with my own friends, uh, fuck around in my computer, in my house, play video games.

534
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:22,840
Speaker 0: Hey, you know, uh, my summer at the summer camp was, you know, capture the flag with the entire summer camp with all, all hundred plus kids.

535
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,100
Speaker 1: We do that with like the like dozens of kids in the woods on our own.

536
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:30,820
Speaker 1: We play softball every Sunday just with a whole bunch of people, two full teams.

537
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's, see, this is the thing, right?

538
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:34,799
Speaker 0: You played softball every Sunday, two full teams.

539
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:36,680
Speaker 0: This is, you're there for eight weeks.

540
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,520
Speaker 0: This goes on for 24 hours a day, every day for eight weeks, nonstop awesomeness.

541
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,286
Speaker 0: Right?

542
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:52,500
Speaker 0: It's like you play capture the flag in the woods with 200 kids and then immediately after you're playing D and D and then immediately after it's like nonstop.

543
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,759
Speaker 1: So I would play it.

544
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,358
Speaker 1: My summers are mostly like that.

545
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,179
Speaker 0: There's only sleeping stops.

546
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,997
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

547
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:00,700
Speaker 1: Plus it was that and I had access to my computer.

548
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,819
Speaker 0: Go put it in the lake.

549
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
Speaker 1: I think we, didn't we do a show on summer camp?

550
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,060
Speaker 1: I'm talking more about camping, actual camping.

551
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,406
Speaker 0: Well, that's part of summer camp.

552
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:17,179
Speaker 0: also is when you're at summer camp, you know, you stay in a cabin most of the time, but you're guaranteed to have at least one camping where you grab all the tents and you go out into the woods.

553
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,860
Speaker 1: How far, I'm so curious.

554
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,279
Speaker 1: So there's degrees of camping.

555
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 0: It depends.

556
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,140
Speaker 0: It depends on the summer camp.

557
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,720
Speaker 1: So you personally, so the one degree is you go, you're basically take a camper or something or stay in a lodge or log cabin somewhere.

558
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,740
Speaker 0: Well, that's summer camp default, right?

559
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,878
Speaker 1: So I've done that.

560
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't even really count.

561
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,819
Speaker 0: That's like you're in a house just in the woods.

562
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,940
Speaker 1: There's you go a trivial distance from a place like that and set up tents.

563
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Speaker 0: I did that when I was a counselor, you know, and I had little kids.

564
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:48,480
Speaker 0: So basically that was the camping that we did with that.

565
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:57,339
Speaker 1: There's you hike a significant distance into the woods camp and then possibly continue on from that and set up a second camp.

566
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:58,579
Speaker 0: I've done that as well.

567
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,960
Speaker 0: When I was in the camp, when I was in the summer camp, we hiked and we passed the Hicks house and the Hicks had a natural spring and we drank their water.

568
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,260
Speaker 0: And it was like an adventure.

569
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,100
Speaker 0: And we went over the out of the valley.

570
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,760
Speaker 0: The camp was into the next valley.

571
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:13,899
Speaker 0: And then we went to the second valley and then we came to valleys back.

572
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's doing that in the winter.

573
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:21,200
Speaker 0: I didn't do it in the winter, but I did it in the desert.

574
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:21,944
Speaker 0: All right.

575
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,120
Speaker 1: So what was the desert camp like the desert of Israel?

576
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

577
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,820
Speaker 0: You walk all day next to a camel.

578
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,840
Speaker 0: You drink a lot of water.

579
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:32,619
Speaker 0: You keep walking, lots of walking, looking at desert shit.

580
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:39,040
Speaker 0: And then eventually you get when the sun goes down, you sort of sleep in the desert.

581
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:41,319
Speaker 0: And but the thing is, you sleep.

582
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:43,499
Speaker 0: It's like a company did it, I guess.

583
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,340
Speaker 0: So basically they had these pre-prepared sleeping places.

584
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,160
Speaker 0: And it wasn't like it was some sort of shelter that you were sleeping in.

585
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,381
Speaker 0: Right.

586
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,700
Speaker 0: It was pretty much the middle of the desert.

587
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,741
Speaker 0: They had a spot that they had lights installed so that those scorpions would bite you at night.

588
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:56,123
Speaker 0: Yeah.

589
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,705
Speaker 1: And actually even like hiking on the Adirondack Trail or whatever, it's kind of the same thing.

590
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:01,259
Speaker 1: But they'll be like, you'll hike and hike and hike.

591
00:30:01,662 --> 00:30:09,460
Speaker 1: And occasionally there'll be these shelters, but I say in quotes because they're basically just a slightly raised platform of semi rotten logs.

592
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,304
Speaker 1: Yeah.

593
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:13,020
Speaker 0: I was sleeping in a sleeping bag on the sand.

594
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,027
Speaker 0: And that was it.

595
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:15,960
Speaker 0: Except for lights that would keep bugs away.

596
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,174
Speaker 1: I'm really I'm actually a fan.

597
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:23,840
Speaker 1: Like I like doing sort of death march hiking's that don't necessarily involve camping.

598
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:31,179
Speaker 1: Like let's go to a trailhead hike for like 30 miles and then end up back at a place where Carl take us back to the hotel.

599
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:35,460
Speaker 1: But I also like the thing where you like hike, you get to a trailhead with all your shit.

600
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:38,060
Speaker 1: You hike like a whole day out somewhere.

601
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,782
Speaker 1: You set up a base camp and then every day you do hikes out from the base camp to other places.

602
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:48,948
Speaker 1: Maybe you like bring a pup tent and you sleep like out one night at a secondary camp away from the base camp.

603
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:51,222
Speaker 1: And then the next day or two, you return back to the base camp.

604
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:54,880
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, I'm not really too much into the walking around in the woods.

605
00:30:55,121 --> 00:31:02,820
Speaker 1: I like the making a campfire and fire is other than campfire chili and campfire curry.

606
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:03,704
Speaker 0: Yeah.

607
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:05,660
Speaker 1: Campfire is the best part of camping.

608
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,453
Speaker 0: I like campfire, you know, doing campfire activities, eating campfire food, cooking campfire food.

609
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:11,574
Speaker 0: Right.

610
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,579
Speaker 0: That's the number one best part.

611
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,686
Speaker 0: The simple stuff like hobo meal, hot dog on a stick you took from the woods, just grab a hot cold hot dog.

612
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,520
Speaker 1: We took from the woods like you found the hot dog.

613
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:27,481
Speaker 0: You grab a stick from the woods, you take a defrosted frozen hot dog, you shove it on the end.

614
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:33,720
Speaker 0: after you sanitize the stick in the fire, you stick the hot dog in the fire and then you eat it off the stick and then you put a marshmallow on the stick.

615
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,364
Speaker 1: So you've clearly.

616
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:44,279
Speaker 1: have you ever gone camping where you had to bring primarily non perishable goods that don't require any free refrigeration of any kind?

617
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,180
Speaker 1: I mean, it was all like you can't like for the kind of camping I used to do.

618
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:52,840
Speaker 0: The longest camp was in the desert for like, you know, I guess three, four days.

619
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,760
Speaker 0: The camel carried all the food.

620
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

621
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:00,049
Speaker 1: But I'm saying you can't bring things that require cooling or refrigeration most of the time.

622
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:00,560
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

623
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,629
Speaker 0: Well, the hot dog situation was mostly like.

624
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:05,160
Speaker 0: that was mostly in summer camp.

625
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:05,461
Speaker 0: Right.

626
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:10,759
Speaker 0: Basically once a week we would just they had basically these campfires like in the woods on the edge of the camp.

627
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:13,720
Speaker 0: So once a week you would just do campfire without camping.

628
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,980
Speaker 0: So it's like you'd go do a campfire and then go to bed in the cabin.

629
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:21,115
Speaker 1: Kevin, I think, but it's just the campfire you were able to.

630
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,227
Speaker 0: you were able to get campfires without camping.

631
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:24,980
Speaker 0: You only camp like once every four weeks.

632
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,242
Speaker 1: Look at how much we like, like in one of the parties or like at our friend's wedding before.

633
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:36,977
Speaker 1: There's something about you start a big fire and you and all your good first invention before they had TV, before they had books, fire.

634
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,813
Speaker 1: If it's like acquaintances or strangers.

635
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,221
Speaker 1: But if it's like your close friends and a relatively small group, you got a fire in the middle.

636
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:52,940
Speaker 1: You sit around the fire, mostly not talking, staring at the fire, drinking things, maybe cooking marshmallows.

637
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,860
Speaker 1: Your feet get too hot and your shoes melt a little bit.

638
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:59,780
Speaker 0: Don't sit down when there's always that came in.

639
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,807
Speaker 1: There's always that one group of people who sits there and they talk about, oh, we should do something to the fire.

640
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,300
Speaker 1: Hey, I think I'm gonna put another log on the fire.

641
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,519
Speaker 1: Man, you made a really good fire.

642
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, fire managers.

643
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,299
Speaker 1: But then there's the other people who ignore that and sit there saying nothing.

644
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:13,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

645
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,959
Speaker 1: And then there's the people who play Benjungka.

646
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,128
Speaker 1: There's something about that.

647
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:27,040
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying is like we think about all the different mediums of entertainment, you know, TV, movies, books, music, fire, video games, board games, fire.

648
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,240
Speaker 0: It was the first one like sitting and it's the one that's least enjoyed by people.

649
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:31,683
Speaker 0: The reason.

650
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:33,200
Speaker 1: But here's why I like having so much.

651
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:40,780
Speaker 1: We combine all these things that as adults we don't get and as adults who are no longer in college, we don't get them often anymore.

652
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:47,219
Speaker 1: These are things you really only get in college or you get snippets of them camping as a kid at summer camps, places like that.

653
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,720
Speaker 1: You get one sit around the fire, which we just talked about why that's great.

654
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:05,362
Speaker 1: Two, you get the sleepover situation of you and a bunch of friends are in a tent or sleeping isolated and nobody will shut the fuck up, which is a very important aspect of enjoyment.

655
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:11,840
Speaker 1: Three, you don't have access to your technology and you're basically just hanging out with each other.

656
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:17,000
Speaker 1: And four, there is no way you can do any work or be productive in any way.

657
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:20,639
Speaker 1: So as a result, you're going to do nothing but fuck around.

658
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:23,840
Speaker 1: Those are the four key elements that make camping great.

659
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,840
Speaker 0: And there's another element that you're forgetting.

660
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:33,183
Speaker 0: See, I don't really like walking long distance in the woods, but explore the woods, right?

661
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:42,944
Speaker 0: Because a lot of times a woods will have all sorts of, you know, hidey holes and type of things, the kind of things that inspired like, you know, Zelda one and Miyazaki movies.

662
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:43,487
Speaker 0: Right.

663
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,040
Speaker 0: So it's like near your camp.

664
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:50,741
Speaker 0: There's going to be like, oh, that weird tree that looks like maybe someone was lynched on it.

665
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,100
Speaker 0: Oh, and there's that weird kind of cave.

666
00:34:53,601 --> 00:35:02,280
Speaker 0: Oh, and there's that little rock thing that hides some salamanders under it and all that kind of action that's right near, you know, and you can explore all those bits.

667
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,346
Speaker 0: Down by the stream.

668
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,640
Speaker 0: Oh, look, there's a little there's a little nook in the stream.

669
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,756
Speaker 0: There's something going on over here.

670
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:08,489
Speaker 0: Check out all that stuff.

671
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:09,820
Speaker 0: That's really good.

672
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,259
Speaker 0: That's the other aspect you did not mention.

673
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:12,849
Speaker 0: The good aspects.

674
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:13,980
Speaker 0: I like that aspect a lot.

675
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,379
Speaker 1: Now, there are problems with camping.

676
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:20,580
Speaker 1: One, most people I've known who have camped in quotes have never actually camped.

677
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Speaker 1: And they usually bring these gigantic tents and these gigantic pavilions.

678
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,910
Speaker 0: The more money you spend on your camp equipment, the less you are actually camping and the more you are.

679
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:31,698
Speaker 0: It's like a hotel.

680
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:34,540
Speaker 1: You'll spend more on better equipment.

681
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Speaker 0: The problem is just bringing bulky and or useless equipment or equipment that makes it more like the people like people like drive their SUV, back it up into the camp and use the power of the SUV to turn a TV on and shit.

682
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:47,344
Speaker 0: Right.

683
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:47,931
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

684
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:48,740
Speaker 1: That's not camping.

685
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:50,217
Speaker 1: That's just portable motel.

686
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:50,460
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:50,843
Speaker 0: Exactly.

688
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:53,080
Speaker 0: It's like I think a lot of those super giant tents.

689
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,860
Speaker 0: That's basically a portable hotel.

690
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:55,341
Speaker 0: Right.

691
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:59,520
Speaker 0: It's like you have to be abandoning a certain amount of stuff.

692
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,300
Speaker 0: And only do the camp stuff for it to be camping.

693
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:02,961
Speaker 0: Yeah.

694
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:03,947
Speaker 0: You know, and it's obviously.

695
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:08,759
Speaker 0: it's like, OK, obviously you don't have to just go naked into the woods and hunt and gather all your food.

696
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:09,622
Speaker 0: Right.

697
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:13,097
Speaker 0: And make fire with only sticks and not bring any matches as a line.

698
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,162
Speaker 0: Right.

699
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,300
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, it's a little gray area of how much stuff can you bring?

700
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,960
Speaker 0: It's like, can you bring, you know, a little gas lighter?

701
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,499
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you can bring that.

702
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,042
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:25,480
Speaker 0: Can you bring some log that automatically sets on fire?

704
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,587
Speaker 0: That's sort of cheating.

705
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:28,180
Speaker 0: You should probably collect some firewood.

706
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:41,260
Speaker 1: I guess there's a difference between people who know basic survival skills and bring the right things versus people who bring things that seem comfortable, but don't really understand the ramifications of those things.

707
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:41,641
Speaker 0: Yeah.

708
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:44,600
Speaker 0: It's like, can you bring a tent to protect yourself from the elements?

709
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,919
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you probably need one of those motherfuckers.

710
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:50,140
Speaker 0: It's like, can I bring basically a pavilion?

711
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:54,420
Speaker 0: It's like you could, but that's basically you're not in the woods.

712
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:55,560
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

713
00:36:55,761 --> 00:37:04,040
Speaker 1: For example, you bring the pavilion to your base camp and then you set out with a lesser amount of material from the base camp.

714
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,060
Speaker 0: I had to see the pavilion to judge it.

715
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,780
Speaker 0: It might be too fancy a pavilion.

716
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,680
Speaker 0: I guess if it has some sort of climate control, that's not just flaps.

717
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:12,824
Speaker 0: That is too much.

718
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:16,660
Speaker 1: But there are, you know, the things that it has lights too much.

719
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,100
Speaker 1: The things I do dislike about camping that mosquitoes depends on where you are.

720
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,239
Speaker 1: You got to choose a good spot to avoid that shit.

721
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,658
Speaker 1: But also things like not really being able to bathe.

722
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:30,900
Speaker 0: Well, you don't go for that long.

723
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do.

724
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,879
Speaker 1: I've been camping for weeks.

725
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,800
Speaker 0: You also haven't been camping for weeks.

726
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:39,379
Speaker 0: And then you always find, you know, like a stream or something to roll around in.

727
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,880
Speaker 0: That's often not a camp near some water.

728
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,242
Speaker 0: I don't.

729
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:42,624
Speaker 0: All right.

730
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:45,220
Speaker 1: In particular, you've ever been winter camping.

731
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,679
Speaker 1: You basically cannot bathe.

732
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,204
Speaker 0: That's true.

733
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:49,339
Speaker 0: Well, desert, we couldn't bathe.

734
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,459
Speaker 0: We were only in the desert for, I think, four days, something like that.

735
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:57,260
Speaker 0: So we bathe before we left and bathe and got back covered in sand otherwise.

736
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,489
Speaker 0: But it's dry sand.

737
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,280
Speaker 0: So no one is really sticky.

738
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,449
Speaker 1: It's a dry heat.

739
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a desert.

740
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:03,324
Speaker 0: Come on.

741
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:05,879
Speaker 1: But that's pretty much it.

742
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,920
Speaker 1: That and people sometimes if you run out of food, you can't for too long.

743
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,290
Speaker 1: The food basically gets increasingly worse.

744
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,880
Speaker 1: the longer you have camps because you're eating the more preserved food.

745
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,403
Speaker 1: You've got less fresh eggs and bacon and more jerky and trail unless you actually hunt and gather.

746
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:25,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, which I have never I've gathered, but I've never hunted.

747
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:27,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't.

748
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:28,180
Speaker 0: I haven't gathered much.

749
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,948
Speaker 1: I've done so far as gathering things like.

750
00:38:32,152 --> 00:38:34,700
Speaker 1: I have gathered nuts in some places.

751
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,999
Speaker 0: I've never seen a nut tree.

752
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,680
Speaker 1: And I have gathered like cattails because you can take the roots and they're super good.

753
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,426
Speaker 1: They're like scallions.

754
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,100
Speaker 1: And I've gathered dandelion.

755
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,591
Speaker 0: And I don't like to eat dandelion.

756
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,179
Speaker 1: Dandelion is delicious.

757
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:44,785
Speaker 0: It's a weed.

758
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:45,600
Speaker 0: It's delicious shit.

759
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,367
Speaker 0: It's a weed.

760
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:47,199
Speaker 0: It's not a food.

761
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:48,063
Speaker 1: Yeah.

762
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,339
Speaker 1: A lot of things that you consider food are also considered weeds.

763
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:51,045
Speaker 0: No.

764
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:52,740
Speaker 1: And dandelions are food.

765
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,320
Speaker 0: No.

766
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,326
Speaker 1: In fact, that L.I.C.

767
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:57,000
Speaker 1: place you get brunch at has a really good dandelion frittata.

768
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,019
Speaker 0: Is it run by hippies?

769
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,902
Speaker 1: Actually, no.

770
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:04,720
Speaker 1: It's got a lot of fancy restaurants sell and serve dandelions.

771
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
Speaker 1: Fresh Direct sells dandelions.

772
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,440
Speaker 0: A lot of fancy restaurants these days are hippie restaurants.

773
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:10,919
Speaker 1: Non hippie restaurants, Scott.

774
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:15,300
Speaker 0: How come they're not coming to harvest my lawn?

775
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,260
Speaker 1: Because your lawn has pesticides and bullshit on it.

776
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,658
Speaker 1: And that's not efficient in any way.

777
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:22,723
Speaker 1: Hey.

778
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:26,059
Speaker 1: Anyway, but there's always amateur hour, too.

779
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,099
Speaker 1: I've many times I've been camping with people who don't quite know what's up.

780
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:35,359
Speaker 1: Number one, the person who does not understand how tents work.

781
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,900
Speaker 0: No, I can't set up the tent.

782
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,920
Speaker 0: These are the that's that's so common.

783
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,360
Speaker 0: It's made fun of in like every TV show or movie about camping.

784
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,469
Speaker 0: Dude can't set up the tent.

785
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,479
Speaker 0: It's like the first joke.

786
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:56,780
Speaker 1: But it's the specific thing that I always see happen are the people who, because they haven't really been outdoorsy people, they seem to make this differentiation in their mind between indoors and outdoors.

787
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,940
Speaker 1: Like you don't think about the fact that we're sitting indoors doing geek nights and 10 feet to my left is outdoors.

788
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:05,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's right there all the time.

789
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,299
Speaker 1: There's not any real difference.

790
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,780
Speaker 0: No, but that's true.

791
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:16,420
Speaker 0: But doors have a psychological effect on people like, you know, I notice I've read about this a lot in terms like video game level design.

792
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
Speaker 0: It's like they'll put a door when they want you to sort of psychologically change your frame of reference.

793
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:34,804
Speaker 0: Like if you put a door like in between two rooms and the two rooms, the puzzle spans the two rooms, you're going to fuck everyone up because when they go into room two, room one gets washed away from their brains by the door.

794
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:35,770
Speaker 0: So you guys.

795
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:41,220
Speaker 0: that's why in Zelda, it's always you're not going to see a door splitting up a puzzle into separate pieces too often.

796
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:41,522
Speaker 0: Right.

797
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:43,919
Speaker 0: It's always, you know, each room has a puzzle to it.

798
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:45,639
Speaker 0: And it's the same thing with the real world.

799
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,430
Speaker 0: And you go in a door.

800
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:46,593
Speaker 0: Right.

801
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,680
Speaker 0: I come into your apartment, I forget the hallway, but the hallways right there.

802
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,680
Speaker 0: It's so close, but it's not in my mind.

803
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,919
Speaker 0: It's compartmentalized by the physical doors.

804
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,420
Speaker 0: And so is the, you know, the wilderness.

805
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,440
Speaker 0: When you leave your car, suddenly you're outside.

806
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,580
Speaker 0: It's totally different from being in the car, even though physically you're like an inch away, just glass in between.

807
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:06,603
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:09,139
Speaker 0: It's like if you park your car on the side of the highway and get out to pee.

809
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,580
Speaker 0: It's like, whoa, totally different world suddenly.

810
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:12,042
Speaker 0: Yep.

811
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:17,900
Speaker 1: I used to do that very often when I drive back from Rochester to Michigan, just for like weekends to see my family or whatever.

812
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:20,020
Speaker 1: I'd always do it in the middle of the night.

813
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,620
Speaker 1: Like I'd leave at like midnight and drive through the night.

814
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:25,060
Speaker 1: And these were these very pleasant.

815
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,140
Speaker 1: Like I have these many fond memories of just blasting music and driving through the night on an empty highway with blackness in all directions.

816
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:39,480
Speaker 1: And occasionally I just stop on the side of the freeway, turn off my engine, get out of the car and just walk like off into a field for a few minutes.

817
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,920
Speaker 1: It was just a very interesting and kind of eerie experience when we talk about.

818
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:52,140
Speaker 1: But what I'm getting at is that these people think of the inside of their tent as indoors and they do not understand how capillary action works.

819
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:55,700
Speaker 1: And they don't understand that tents are often not actually waterproof.

820
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:00,360
Speaker 1: And their bedroll is right up next to the fucking edge of their tent.

821
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,859
Speaker 1: And or they didn't put a tarp over the top of their tent.

822
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:04,638
Speaker 1: It rains or a dews.

823
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,619
Speaker 1: The entire inside of their tent is soaking wet the next day.

824
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:08,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's bad.

825
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,179
Speaker 0: I'm guessing this has happened to you.

826
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,840
Speaker 1: Never happened to me because I know it happened to someone you were with.

827
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,765
Speaker 1: I was a Cub Scout.

828
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:16,220
Speaker 1: I learned I had actual lessons on this bullshit.

829
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:18,659
Speaker 1: I've seen it happen to so many people.

830
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,939
Speaker 1: Amateur hour number two are the people who don't stake their tent down and it just blows away.

831
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:26,119
Speaker 0: Or that's the most common joke you see.

832
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:35,200
Speaker 1: Or they put their tents in what appears like a good spot that is actually a place where rainwater will collect and or wash.

833
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:36,004
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

834
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:38,899
Speaker 0: All right.

835
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

836
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:41,920
Speaker 0: Why don't we talk about going to the bathroom when camping?

837
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,890
Speaker 1: Fucking pee in the woods.

838
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:43,620
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

839
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,262
Speaker 0: Yeah.

840
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,179
Speaker 0: But what if you got to poop?

841
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:59,060
Speaker 1: So sometimes I've been to places where we're camping, like our base camp is near a place where the park service or someone has dug latrines or set up designated places that it'll be taken care of porta potties.

842
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:11,380
Speaker 1: I have only once or twice in my life gone camping in such a place where I either had to poop in a bag and take it out with me, which in some preserves you have to do that or you have to dig a cat hole.

843
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:19,859
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, if you are going somewhere where you're going to have to dig cat holes, for the love of God, learn how to do that.

844
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:23,119
Speaker 1: So don't fuck it up or bears will come and murder you.

845
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,947
Speaker 0: That's also true.

846
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,340
Speaker 0: That's why you need the anti bear weapon.

847
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,469
Speaker 1: They need the bear ball.

848
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,640
Speaker 1: You need the bear blasters.

849
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had those.

850
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,754
Speaker 0: But yeah, in the desert, though, right?

851
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,020
Speaker 0: It's totally different in the woods.

852
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,060
Speaker 0: In the woods, your biggest worry is like, did I bring toilet paper?

853
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,478
Speaker 0: Should I use a leaf or something?

854
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:38,640
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,580
Speaker 0: And you sort of throw it away into the woods or put it in a trash bag or something.

856
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:43,733
Speaker 0: And the desert.

857
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:44,280
Speaker 0: Right.

858
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:46,720
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, if you just pee, just pee in the desert.

859
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,937
Speaker 0: Whatever desert's happy to have some fucking water.

860
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:49,300
Speaker 0: Right.

861
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,572
Speaker 0: What do you poop in the desert?

862
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:51,260
Speaker 0: Right.

863
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,280
Speaker 0: OK, just leave some poop in the middle of desert.

864
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,039
Speaker 0: Who gives a shit besides the shit.

865
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:57,580
Speaker 0: But how do you wipe yourself in the desert?

866
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,488
Speaker 0: There ain't no leaf.

867
00:43:59,094 --> 00:43:59,740
Speaker 0: There ain't no nothing.

868
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,465
Speaker 0: Just sand.

869
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:01,639
Speaker 0: You can wipe your ass with sand.

870
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:04,060
Speaker 1: No, I would waste some of my water.

871
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:06,240
Speaker 0: No, it's not going to do it right.

872
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,340
Speaker 0: You have to physically wipe.

873
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,939
Speaker 0: See, what you do is you bring toilet paper with you into the desert and you bring it out with you.

874
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:11,423
Speaker 0: No.

875
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,219
Speaker 0: And then how do you get rid of the toilet paper?

876
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:14,005
Speaker 0: All right.

877
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:15,460
Speaker 0: You set it on fucking fire.

878
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:16,171
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

879
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:16,679
Speaker 0: Right.

880
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,279
Speaker 0: But you don't set it on fire in the campfire.

881
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:19,627
Speaker 0: You just leave.

882
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:21,740
Speaker 0: you basically have the designated area.

883
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:25,560
Speaker 0: It's like walk at least this many paces away from the fire, the campfire.

884
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:29,700
Speaker 0: You know, if you even have one in the desert, you might not need one except for cooking.

885
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,518
Speaker 0: You don't need it for warmth.

886
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:35,540
Speaker 0: And then poop, wipe yourself and then set the toilet paper on fire at the spot you pooped and then come back.

887
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,280
Speaker 0: And a lot of people like had trouble setting their toilet paper on fire.

888
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,223
Speaker 0: Pretty sad.

889
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:42,089
Speaker 0: Like, come on, guys.

890
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,400
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
