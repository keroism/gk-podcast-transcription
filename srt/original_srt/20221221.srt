1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,998
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 21st, 2022.

2
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:10,460
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:14,269
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,835
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Night.

5
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,970
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about those holiday cartoons and holiday animation.

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,428
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:32,910
Speaker 0: So it's right on the edge of the temperature, where I can just bike home from work on like a city bike instead of taking the subway when I have to go in.

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:42,110
Speaker 0: So I biked home today, and it's right on the line of being able to do that without wearing like gloves and a ski jacket and like getting out for it.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,784
Speaker 1: Well, today, you know, the weather for today was between 28 and 42 Fahrenheit.

10
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:49,569
Speaker 0: It was like 37 when I biked home.

11
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,290
Speaker 1: Alright, so right in the middle there, right?

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,789
Speaker 1: So it's going to get Thursday and Friday, tomorrow and the next day, are going to be warmer, right?

13
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:04,369
Speaker 0: Well, because one of the bigger storms to have ever formed in North America is forming right now.

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a big storm coming.

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,450
Speaker 1: It's supposed to only rain on us, but in parts north of us, it's going to snow, right?

16
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,150
Speaker 1: They postponed hockey in Buffalo because it's going to snow.

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,230
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, this basically is hitting America.

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,690
Speaker 1: It's going to snow too much for Buffalo.

19
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:24,756
Speaker 0: It's hitting America at a specific holiday time.

20
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:33,470
Speaker 0: that's basically going to completely ruin a huge number of Americans' travel plans, which might be good in terms of, you know, this last hopefully wave of COVID.

21
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:34,770
Speaker 1: I don't know.

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,710
Speaker 0: Nobody can go anywhere.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,690
Speaker 1: But anyway, that's Thursday and Friday.

24
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:42,330
Speaker 1: And then you got Saturday, which is the day that Christmas Eve is on, right?

25
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,389
Speaker 1: And it's like that's after the storm.

26
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,710
Speaker 1: But that's what's going to happen is right after the storm is over, right?

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:55,749
Speaker 1: As Friday after the storm passes over, the other pressure system is going to come in and it's going to be cold AF.

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,115
Speaker 1: We're talking 13F, right?

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,569
Speaker 1: Which is for you other people, negative ten and a half C.

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,170
Speaker 0: Which still is fine.

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,970
Speaker 0: You know, I go to Michigan.

32
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:12,130
Speaker 0: As long as the F number is above zero, it is still reasonable.

33
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:15,810
Speaker 0: Like you just got to wear a thicker mitten instead of a glove and you can deal with it.

34
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:18,070
Speaker 1: But I mean, it's not Antarctica.

35
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:23,470
Speaker 1: It's not like you're going to be, you know, I mean, some people might be in danger out there, but it's just going to be really cold.

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,890
Speaker 0: Well, I guess with Fahrenheit.

37
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,790
Speaker 1: And it's going to stay really cold for quite a while.

38
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,790
Speaker 0: The useful part of Fahrenheit, other than the fact that about one degree Fahrenheit is about like a temperature difference a human could notice in the ambient temperature.

39
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:38,610
Speaker 0: When it gets near zero, you know, that's where salt freezes.

40
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,270
Speaker 0: That's why Fahrenheit's weird compared to the rest of you, because Fahrenheit sets zero when saltwater freezes.

41
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:54,950
Speaker 0: But that's actually a really important line, because below the point where saltwater freezes is also the point where human skin freezes faster than you would think if you don't know.

42
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,290
Speaker 0: It's not an obvious danger to people who haven't grown up in cold places.

43
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,670
Speaker 0: Like that is where walking around the block could be dangerous as opposed to just very uncomfortable.

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,590
Speaker 1: The point is, it's about to be cold.

45
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,590
Speaker 1: It's already cold.

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,749
Speaker 1: It's going to get colder where we live.

47
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:14,170
Speaker 0: And with climate change, these kinds of wild swings are going to be more and more common.

48
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,261
Speaker 1: So last weekend- Why can't we just get, you know, we changed all these terms, right?

49
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,790
Speaker 1: We started off calling it global warming, and then we changed it to climate change.

50
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,895
Speaker 0: Well, it is global warming.

51
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:25,050
Speaker 0: In the end, everything gets warmer, but there are temporary periods a lot more.

52
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,884
Speaker 0: Right, well, make it fucking warmer already.

53
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:27,710
Speaker 1: Stop with the cold.

54
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:34,305
Speaker 0: So, we skied at Hunter Mountain on Saturday, and they had like over a foot of fresh, beautiful powder.

55
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:36,150
Speaker 0: Like top 20 ski days.

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,370
Speaker 1: Was it just because it was cold and they made fake snow?

57
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,822
Speaker 0: No, it was all natural snow.

58
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:41,336
Speaker 1: It just dumped on- Was it really snowed there?

59
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:42,529
Speaker 1: Because it didn't snow here at all.

60
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:51,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, at Hunter Mountain, like I said, we drove up there in the new car, and there's no snow, and you hit a line, and there's just a foot of real snow after that.

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,854
Speaker 0: So, great.

62
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:54,930
Speaker 0: One of the best skiing days that mountain's had in a decade.

63
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:03,150
Speaker 0: This weekend on Friday, it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit and pouring rain up there.

64
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, because like I said, it's right before the cold comes in.

65
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,344
Speaker 1: It's going to be warm.

66
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:10,149
Speaker 1: I mean, warm for winter, right?

67
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:19,970
Speaker 0: So, if it had just gotten cold, Hunter Mountain would turn from snowy to still snowy, but instead it's going to be 50 degrees for one day.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:27,186
Speaker 0: Everything's going to melt, and then over the course of that day, it's going to drop from 49 to 7, and it's going to freeze.

69
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,870
Speaker 1: If it's still wet, it'll make a sheet of ice.

70
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,248
Speaker 0: It's going to make a sheet of ice, and it's going to be like normal Hunter Mountain, like what I'm used to skiing on.

71
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:38,729
Speaker 1: Just go ice skating instead if it's a sheet of ice.

72
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,490
Speaker 0: You know, not that you care about skis, but you know, bikes, there's different bike profiles, like you ride a different kind of bike for different things.

73
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,426
Speaker 0: So, the skis I use, because we live in the east and I ski at Hunter Mountain, they're basically ice skates.

74
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,070
Speaker 0: The sides of them are like razor blades.

75
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the ice skates at the bottom is a razor blade.

76
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when I'm skiing on ice, what you do is I'm edging, so only the side of the ski is actually touching anything.

77
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:08,630
Speaker 1: Why not just wear a skate so you don't have to turn your foot sideways?

78
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,870
Speaker 0: There are reasons why that wouldn't actually work, and there are specialty types of things that kind of can do that.

79
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:28,250
Speaker 0: The problem is, the skate would still have to be 160 to 180 centimeters long to be able to hold an edge on that much slope.

80
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,817
Speaker 0: It's not like ice skating straight.

81
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,150
Speaker 0: Imagine ice skating on a 40 degree incline.

82
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,128
Speaker 0: You don't want to point those things straight down.

83
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:43,944
Speaker 1: It's been so long since we did a Wednesday show, so I got an old news, but it was an important news.

84
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,229
Speaker 1: It was like nine days ago, right?

85
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,597
Speaker 1: If you don't know, there was a person, a very important person, right?

86
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:03,815
Speaker 0: You'll see.

87
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,269
Speaker 0: You've definitely heard this person before.

88
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:15,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Ichiro Mizuki, who was basically one of the most famous singers of anime music of all time, right?

89
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,570
Speaker 1: All the old, you know, the Mazinger Z song.

90
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,250
Speaker 0: All the Mazinger, Kamen Riders, Voltron.

91
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,733
Speaker 1: The Captain Harlock song.

92
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:27,270
Speaker 1: It's like, this is the guy who sang all these legendary anime songs, and he was old and sick.

93
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,653
Speaker 1: He was, what, 74?

94
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:38,010
Speaker 1: And he passed away, and it was sad times because, you know, not only was this guy just, you know, a guy who sang old anime songs.

95
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,329
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who sung anime theme songs, right?

96
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:47,650
Speaker 1: Not only did he sing the legendary ones, right, but he was all about it, even later in life, right?

97
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,117
Speaker 1: It's like, he was always appearing and singing this.

98
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:52,103
Speaker 1: Like, he was into it, you know?

99
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:54,450
Speaker 1: He was doing it for the fans, right?

100
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,595
Speaker 1: It's like, he wasn't.

101
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:59,309
Speaker 1: just like, you know, a lot of people are like, "Oh yeah, I did that back in the day," right?

102
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:00,524
Speaker 1: "And now I'm doing something

103
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:00,788
Speaker 1: else.".

104
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that is just, that was a gig.

105
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:04,966
Speaker 0: I don't, I'm not the anime guy.

106
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:05,950
Speaker 0: I just did anime.

107
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,746
Speaker 0: This guy was just like, "I'm the anime

108
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,028
Speaker 0: guy.".

109
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,292
Speaker 1: He embraced it.

110
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:11,614
Speaker 1: He's like, "This is who I am.

111
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:20,590
Speaker 1: I am the guy who sang the legendary anime songs, and I'm gonna keep that, you know, I'm gonna keep doing that and love doing that for the people," right?

112
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:24,470
Speaker 1: And, you know, I wish more people had that kind of attitude.

113
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,675
Speaker 0: Be, be, be great in your niche.

114
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:29,318
Speaker 0: Be good to your fans.

115
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,047
Speaker 0: Enjoy what you do if, you know, you have the luck to have a job.

116
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,150
Speaker 0: that is something you like.

117
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,399
Speaker 0: And, yeah, this is a loss to the world of music.

118
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,925
Speaker 0: I particularly like this style of singing.

119
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,010
Speaker 0: Maybe because I grew up on a lot of anime.

120
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:54,470
Speaker 0: In some other news, I don't have a news, but I have a Geek Byte, because as you all know, the Dragon Prince, the animated Netflix show, that was pretty good.

121
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,817
Speaker 0: You know, Scott watched a bunch.

122
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,529
Speaker 0: Pretty sure we did a Geek Nights episode on it.

123
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:58,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

124
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:13,970
Speaker 0: And it had three seasons, and then it got sort of, there was a debate or a delay on whether, like, finding out whether or not it would be continued, which was not necessarily guaranteed because Netflix has a spotty history of investing.

125
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,853
Speaker 1: I think it's guaranteed.

126
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:19,330
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, even though we now think it's guaranteed, they could change their fucking minds, right?

127
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,470
Speaker 1: Yep.

128
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:26,044
Speaker 0: So, basically, the Dragon Prince ended at a point where it could, that could have been the end, at the end of season three.

129
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:29,130
Speaker 0: Like, they meet the Dragon Queen and stuff gets resolved.

130
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:41,570
Speaker 0: But, we do know they continued the show, supposedly, to make all of the originally planned seasons, but in the very least, season four, like, will complete and is out there and we can just watch it.

131
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,474
Speaker 0: And I watched all of this come out up to this point.

132
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:48,465
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, it's actually, sadly, a little disappointing.

133
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:50,650
Speaker 0: It's very uneven.

134
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,258
Speaker 0: Like, if I had to add to just review Dragon Prince from the first three seasons, it's a solid kid's show.

135
00:08:56,338 --> 00:09:04,010
Speaker 0: Like, not quite as good as Avatar, which I think is a much better overall show, just in terms of all the different aspects you could rate it on.

136
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,754
Speaker 0: But, Dragon Prince was solid.

137
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:10,527
Speaker 0: Great character designs, okay animation, good voice acting, like, it had a lot going for it.

138
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:11,390
Speaker 0: We were into it.

139
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,115
Speaker 0: And it was pretty consistent at being what it was.

140
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:20,124
Speaker 0: I gotta say, the new season of Dragon Prince, it does not start strong.

141
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:23,510
Speaker 0: Like, the dialogue is written really badly.

142
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:27,940
Speaker 0: Scenes just sort of repeat and loop over and over and over again.

143
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,630
Speaker 0: Like, nothing, there's almost a whole episode where just nothing happens.

144
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,093
Speaker 0: But, side characters making quips.

145
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,098
Speaker 0: The writing, like, just gets weird and off.

146
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,164
Speaker 0: character and characters do things that don't really make sense.

147
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:46,330
Speaker 0: Like, even from a lazy kid's show writing perspective, they just feel off.

148
00:09:47,290 --> 00:10:00,045
Speaker 0: And this culminates where, in one of the Discords I'm in, I think our Discord, but I've seen this in a few other places, before I watched season four, people kept saying, "Yeah, watch out for those elf farts.

149
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:03,469
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, Dragon Prince, way more elf farts than you asked

150
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:03,710
Speaker 0: for.".

151
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:08,904
Speaker 0: And I assumed there would be, like, an off moment with an elf farting.

152
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:13,189
Speaker 1: Like, I figured there was, like, the people were-- No, it's probably a running joke of constant elf farting.

153
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:25,930
Speaker 0: It's not a joke, is the thing that is, like, there is a joke about elf farts, but elf farts just sort of keep coming up in a canonical and lore-driven way.

154
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:34,009
Speaker 0: Canonically, a certain kind of elf's fart smells like petrichor and this continues to come up.

155
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:40,737
Speaker 0: And there are other elements like this that just feel off and weird.

156
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:48,286
Speaker 0: And honestly, the first, like, four or five episodes of The New Dragon Prince, as a result, kind of a slog.

157
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:51,630
Speaker 0: Like, the writing is almost below the line where I would even continue.

158
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,196
Speaker 1: I think this might be one of those situations.

159
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:59,288
Speaker 1: Usually when this kind of thing happens, it's because there might be some sort of production change of some kind.

160
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,482
Speaker 1: I would go looking at the credits and see, like, are there new people?

161
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,090
Speaker 1: Did they split some work between some studios?

162
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,440
Speaker 0: Did they compress the writing, like, the timeframes to make episodes?

163
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,370
Speaker 0: Did they try to do a South Park, but they don't have a team that's paid enough to do a South Park?

164
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:23,948
Speaker 1: There must be some sort of production-related, behind-the-scenes explanation for a quality decrease of that nature, right?

165
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:24,850
Speaker 1: It seems likely.

166
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,331
Speaker 1: It's so uneven.

167
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:41,150
Speaker 0: Like, there will be perfectly cromulent, like, normal scenes that are great and awesome dragon biz, and then, like, the next scene will just really not feel right or, like, break the pacing or not fit into what had happened into the episode up to that point.

168
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:47,202
Speaker 0: Like, it'll rocket back and forth between almost too much gravitas and whatever.

169
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:59,090
Speaker 0: the opposite of gravitas is, like, scene by scene, and... I don't know, I'm gonna keep watching it to the end, season four, but I'm not super inclined to continue beyond that if this continues.

170
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:16,090
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm gonna watch to the end, though, is that you can almost kind of skip a lot of what happens in the first few episodes of season four, but it does just pick up where the show left off and is heading straight long, like, headlong into the mysteries that were left unanswered at the end of season three.

171
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,133
Speaker 0: Like, "Where's

172
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:17,636
Speaker 0: Dad?"

173
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:18,440
Speaker 0: and "What's up with the other

174
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:18,882
Speaker 0: dragons?"

175
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,390
Speaker 0: and all that kind of stuff.

176
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,148
Speaker 1: We know that.

177
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,930
Speaker 0: Yup, and it does just keep going.

178
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,630
Speaker 1: They tell you that in, like, the first episode.

179
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,086
Speaker 0: They do.

180
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:38,170
Speaker 0: But, uh, the other thing that... I don't know, what I'm disappointed by is that the pattern that seems to be emerging is whenever the non-human characters are doing their biz, it's great.

181
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,270
Speaker 0: And then whenever it goes back to the human characters, everything's boring or uncharacteristic.

182
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,607
Speaker 0: So, if you're in the show...

183
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,190
Speaker 1: What about the cool ant or whatever?

184
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,532
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they're all fine.

185
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:59,910
Speaker 0: Everyone's fine, except the main human and humanoid characters, which are just kind of plotting and off-model in terms of how they act and behave and speak.

186
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:01,508
Speaker 1: And we'll see.

187
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,190
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend the show based on how it has progressed so far compared to the first three seasons.

188
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,150
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, they have the deal, ostensibly, for eight seasons, I think, right?

189
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,125
Speaker 0: Seven was what I thought, but it might be eight.

190
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:14,670
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

191
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,975
Speaker 1: I don't know.

192
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:20,290
Speaker 1: And this is like, hey, first of all, like I said before, it could get cancelled before then.

193
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,357
Speaker 0: So, they got renewed for three more seasons.

194
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:28,710
Speaker 0: So, this one and two more is what they are currently officially renewed for if nothing changes.

195
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:35,263
Speaker 1: But, you know, the point is, like, hey, even if it goes the number of seasons they said, it's like, that's good.

196
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:36,606
Speaker 1: It's a limited show.

197
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,170
Speaker 1: It's gonna end and have an ending.

198
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,478
Speaker 1: But, it's like, there's still a such thing as too long, right?

199
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:47,970
Speaker 1: It's like, we talk about, like, oh, yeah, it's much better to have a show that has a beginning, middle, end than one that goes forever.

200
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:54,090
Speaker 1: And that's true, but even if you have that ending, it's like, you could still be too long, right?

201
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:56,874
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the Hobbit movies are a good example.

202
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:57,456
Speaker 0: Like, The Hobbit.

203
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:03,570
Speaker 0: If you made a single standalone movie to cover The Hobbit, it'd either have to be too long or you'd have to cut too much out.

204
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,401
Speaker 0: Maybe if you made two movies, that would probably work.

205
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,190
Speaker 0: Making four movies was a terrible idea.

206
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:11,369
Speaker 1: I thought they made three.

207
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:12,739
Speaker 0: It wasn't the third movie.

208
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,590
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure there were four.

209
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,169
Speaker 1: I think there's three.

210
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,975
Speaker 0: I only saw two and I just gave up.

211
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,446
Speaker 0: Yep, there are, oh, god, how long is that third one?

212
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:21,429
Speaker 0: God damn.

213
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's three long, it's basically three long movies.

214
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,189
Speaker 0: Yep, I watched two and I gave up.

215
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,656
Speaker 1: The Hobbit is one book.

216
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:35,870
Speaker 1: The Lord of the Rings is three big books, which I'm pretty sure any one of the three Lord of the Rings volumes is bigger than The Hobbit.

217
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,970
Speaker 1: And then The Hobbit, movie-wise, is just as long as The Lord of the Rings movies.

218
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:51,930
Speaker 0: I remember the thing I was most annoyed by is the first Hobbit movie ends, like, three quarters, maybe even four fifths through The Hobbit book.

219
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:53,457
Speaker 1: Yep.

220
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:54,370
Speaker 1: Anyway.

221
00:14:54,671 --> 00:15:00,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, one example that sort of really crystallizes what's going on with the dragon prince.

222
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,730
Speaker 1: now is there's a scene where they-- How long are we talking about this dragon prince?

223
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:03,750
Speaker 0: How come I'm killing time?

224
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,570
Speaker 0: But, so, they meet another dragon, like one of the other king super serious dragons, and they know some stuff.

225
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,500
Speaker 0: So they go in and there's a really actually pretty cool, like, Lord of the Rings style adventure.

226
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,390
Speaker 0: if we're gonna go deep, deep, deep to meet the dragon that doesn't want to fucking talk to anyone who's super dangerous.

227
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,858
Speaker 0: And that's all really great.

228
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,670
Speaker 0: But then they meet the dragon, and the dragon's animated super cool.

229
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:36,608
Speaker 0: And instead of leading this conversation with, "Hey, ancient king of dragons, here's a bunch of information you should know about the outside world that you will definitely react

230
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:36,809
Speaker 0: to."

231
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:43,190
Speaker 0: They have a bunch of completely worthless, like, fifteen minutes of conversation that means nothing and goes nowhere.

232
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:52,890
Speaker 0: And then when the dragon decides to just kill them because they're wasting his time, that's when they reveal the information that, like, if you and I were there would have said instantly.

233
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,307
Speaker 0: Like, "Yo, dragon guy, the other dragon's dead and the humans did some shit and they're gonna release the bad

234
00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:58,527
Speaker 0: guy.".

235
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:04,230
Speaker 0: It's that kind of mistake that is dragging the show into the ground.

236
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:15,269
Speaker 0: Anyway, things of the day.

237
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:20,060
Speaker 0: So, in Bob's Burgers, the show, there is a Thanksgiving episode.

238
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,860
Speaker 0: You know, they do holiday episodes just like any American cartoon on TV would, like The Simpsons always had the holiday episodes.

239
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,560
Speaker 0: And in the Thanksgiving episode, two of the characters make up and perform a Thanksgiving song.

240
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Speaker 0: They try to make a Thanksgiving song that would be on the level of a Christmas song during Christmas.

241
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,528
Speaker 0: And, uh, it's pretty funny.

242
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,859
Speaker 1: So, what this- Adam Sandler already did that.

243
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,462
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

244
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaker 0: So, there aren't that many Thanksgiving songs compared to Christmas songs.

245
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,399
Speaker 1: We don't need them.

246
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,862
Speaker 0: Yeah.

247
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:52,320
Speaker 0: So, they make this gravy song about gravy boats.

248
00:16:53,241 --> 00:17:05,799
Speaker 0: This video, I think of the day, is some fan or someone took this joke throwaway song that takes up maybe 45 to 90 seconds of an episode of Bob's Burgers.

249
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:10,538
Speaker 0: And they sang it seriously and made a music video to it.

250
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,380
Speaker 0: So, what do you got?

251
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:18,380
Speaker 1: Another anime music news, right, while we're on that train, right?

252
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,380
Speaker 1: So, the voice actor of Min May in the original Macross TV series is Mari Ijima.

253
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:24,815
Speaker 1: Yup.

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,688
Speaker 1: And she also sang a bunch of the music.

255
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,195
Speaker 1: pretty much any time Min May was singing.

256
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:28,860
Speaker 1: It was her singing.

257
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,020
Speaker 0: I want to say she came to Anime Boston as a guest.

258
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,299
Speaker 0: We did.

259
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,379
Speaker 0: Several times.

260
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,749
Speaker 1: We saw her at Anime Boston.

261
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,777
Speaker 1: She did a concert at Anime Boston.

262
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:37,279
Speaker 1: We were there.

263
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:41,740
Speaker 1: I want to say she was- I'm pretty sure she was there multiple years.

264
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,459
Speaker 1: I don't think it was more than one time.

265
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,297
Speaker 0: I think it was two times skimming.

266
00:17:45,418 --> 00:17:45,640
Speaker 0: Anyway.

267
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:47,974
Speaker 1: She performed at Anime Boston.

268
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:48,416
Speaker 1: We were there.

269
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,000
Speaker 1: But anyway.

270
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,580
Speaker 1: Apparently, right, she's been signed to like I guess the same or at least I don't know if she's still on the same record label.

271
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,740
Speaker 1: But the record label that she was signed to in the early 80s, which is Victor something?

272
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,743
Speaker 1: Victor Entertainment, right?

273
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:12,718
Speaker 1: On their official YouTube channel, they uploaded a bunch of music videos from her in like 1980 something.

274
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:20,460
Speaker 1: It's like music videos that basically were not available unless maybe some nerd had them somewhere.

275
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,420
Speaker 1: But this is shit from the vault, right?

276
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:35,220
Speaker 0: Prior to this, you probably, if you even knew these existed and saw them, it was probably because someone old ran a panel at an anime con somewhere and happened to have them.

277
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:41,476
Speaker 1: You could hear all this music, including the songs from DYRL and I guess her other music, right?

278
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,940
Speaker 1: You could get her albums, no problem.

279
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,787
Speaker 1: But there were music videos for these things made.

280
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:48,495
Speaker 1: These music videos are about as old as we are.

281
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,821
Speaker 1: 82, 83, 84.

282
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:54,070
Speaker 1: And I don't think they were available easily.

283
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:56,380
Speaker 1: And now they're just on YouTube and you can just watch them.

284
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:56,948
Speaker 1: Not bad.

285
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,538
Speaker 1: And so that's the thing of the day.

286
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:04,033
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, Alif the Unseen.

287
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,940
Speaker 0: We're definitely doing this show in January.

288
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,307
Speaker 1: I'm like 60 or 70% done now.

289
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,547
Speaker 0: Yup, I am powering through it.

290
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:11,169
Speaker 0: I like it.

291
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:11,852
Speaker 0: I got thoughts.

292
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:13,620
Speaker 0: Definitely gonna read the other book by this author.

293
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,126
Speaker 0: But I gotta read the world we make at some point.

294
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:24,300
Speaker 0: So maybe in between the two we'll do a little, not another book club episode, but I'm sure we'll both read that world pretty quick.

295
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,551
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll talk about it a little bit.

296
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,500
Speaker 0: Do a little special.

297
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:34,680
Speaker 0: But if you're reading along with us, read Alif the Unseen because by the end of January we're gonna do the book club episode.

298
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,019
Speaker 0: I guarantee it, unless something unforeseen happens.

299
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,012
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I guess we'll likely be at PAX East for a panel or two.

300
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,800
Speaker 0: Don't expect us to be there hanging out, like playing games for the whole weekend.

301
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,192
Speaker 0: 4-Day Con, still a little early for that maybe for us.

302
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,060
Speaker 0: We will not be at MAGFest this year.

303
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:54,284
Speaker 0: A few people.

304
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:55,808
Speaker 0: we know we'll be, but we will not be.

305
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:59,440
Speaker 0: And otherwise, just watch for our stuff on the internet.

306
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,686
Speaker 0: Follow us in all the places you can find us.

307
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:06,780
Speaker 0: Don't rely on Twitter to find out when Geek Nights is live because who knows how long that shit's gonna last.

308
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,951
Speaker 1: Yup, and I guess, I don't know, we're gonna have many Geek Nights we're gonna have here.

309
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:16,800
Speaker 1: I don't see anything interfering next week, even though it's a holiday week.

310
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm taking most of the week off work because I have Use 'Em or Lose 'Em vacation days.

311
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,520
Speaker 1: Probably not a New Year's Day Geek Nights.

312
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,002
Speaker 0: Yup, probably not.

313
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:35,040
Speaker 0: So really, the traditional Geek Nights holiday hiatus is probably gonna be in January because the second week of January, I gotta go to Frankfurt for work.

314
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,740
Speaker 0: And the fourth week of January-ish, I'm gonna be in Colorado for a week, so we're gonna miss at least half the episodes in January.

315
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,259
Speaker 1: Alright, but it looks like December is good.

316
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:45,665
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:48,620
Speaker 1: If we have ideas for shows.

318
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:52,466
Speaker 0: Send your ideas to geeknights@frontrowcrew.com.

319
00:20:52,867 --> 00:21:00,340
Speaker 0: or uh, I don't know, mash your hand on the keyboard and type Geek Nights show episode something and you'll probably find a way to contact us.

320
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:12,360
Speaker 0: So a while ago, in 2019, we did an episode on not the Charlie Brown Christmas, but it's the great pumpkin Charlie Brown, a Halloween special.

321
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:21,700
Speaker 0: We haven't actually, as Scott pointed out, ever done a show on like, the animated Christmas or even general holiday specials across the board.

322
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,173
Speaker 1: Well, so you know, back in the day when TV was still a thing, I wanna say, I'm not 100% sure on this, right?

323
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:40,280
Speaker 1: But the Charlie Brown one, the Christmas special, was like one of the earliest ones, like the early 60s, especially in terms of animated ones.

324
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:55,280
Speaker 1: And it sort of, I guess, gave, you know, maybe there was some other non-animated one earlier, I don't know, but the TV networks had this idea, like hey, make a special thing with a big budget, bigger than regular, right?

325
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,620
Speaker 1: That's a one-time deal, not quite a movie, but you know, a special television program.

326
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,840
Speaker 0: So, I wanna point out the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer stop motion was a year before the Charlie Brown Christmas special.

327
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,319
Speaker 0: Ooh, so maybe that one, but the point is, it's still- Don't think I'm an expert at this, Scott and I have the same Wikipedia tabs open.

328
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:30,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but regardless, they made, you know, it was a thing on television, right, to put a big budget into a production that was real fancy compared to the rest of television for a holiday special, you had a good excuse, right?

329
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,423
Speaker 1: People are home, they're not working, right?

330
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:46,100
Speaker 1: And you put it on TV once a year, it's on, you know, if you put it on your network, 'cause your network has the rights to it, and then people only got one chance a year to see it, and that's it.

331
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:00,400
Speaker 1: And it's a special deal, so you can sell big ads on it, and you can just keep showing the same thing year after year, because it was such a big budget, it doesn't, it ages well, it's about holidays, there's nothing, you know, temporal about it.

332
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:12,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can always be standalone in a way that, even if it's a special in the middle of some other long-running thing, you don't have to worry about people, like, having a ton of contacts, they can be pretty standalone.

333
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:20,000
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of Christmas specials over the years to things that I otherwise had never watched, like that Kimoguri Orange Road anime special.

334
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:34,020
Speaker 1: But, you know, and it becomes, for some people who keep seeing it every year, it becomes like a tradition, a special treat, of like, ooh, I get to watch the thing once a year, and there's no other way for me to see it, because VHS doesn't even exist yet, right?

335
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:48,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, granted, even when VHS existed, we, I remember as a kid, we would watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special and the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer special every year, either on TV or on a VHS, 'cause we had taped it off of TV.

336
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,228
Speaker 1: So for some people, it was a tradition, right?

337
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:54,978
Speaker 1: But it's like this, like we just said, Charlie Brown Christmas special was from, what, the '60s, right?

338
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:55,766
Speaker 1: Yep.

339
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,360
Speaker 1: It's like, but I didn't see it until the '80s, and for the first time, it was already 20-something years old.

340
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:10,500
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, I know, my parents showed it to us when we were kids, because they had seen it many, many years earlier, and it was part of their culture.

341
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:15,733
Speaker 1: And now it's 60-something years old, and I'm, you know, I think you can watch it on Apple TV Plus now, right?

342
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:18,700
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still, I'm sure it's still on TV if anyone still has that.

343
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,360
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you could just watch it on like a random YouTube channel that uploaded it.

344
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,760
Speaker 1: Maybe, I think they're all, all the Charlie Brown stuff at least, that specifically is an Apple TV Plus.

345
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:29,459
Speaker 0: Nah, Apple TV.

346
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:37,846
Speaker 1: So regardless, the, it's like you have these specials, not just the Charlie Brown ones, but all kinds of them, right?

347
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,327
Speaker 1: People kept doing this, right?

348
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:57,540
Speaker 1: They kept trying to make holiday specials, hoping that, you know, there were already these established ones that were showing year after year, bringing in ratings, bringing in money that didn't cost any additional money to the TV network, because it was paid for so long ago, and copyright terms were long.

349
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:02,340
Speaker 1: So, TV networks kept trying to make more of these all the time, right?

350
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,396
Speaker 0: I want to point out, the Flintstones Christmas special was also 1964, before the Charlie Brown one.

351
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:09,964
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

352
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,499
Speaker 1: But the Flintstones one didn't hold that long.

353
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:20,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I, I, I am pretty sure I have seen that special, but I do not- I probably have, I just forget all the details from it.

354
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,008
Speaker 0: I do not remember anything from it.

355
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:24,152
Speaker 0: Literally nothing.

356
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,420
Speaker 0: I, but I'm pretty sure I saw it as a kid.

357
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:29,520
Speaker 1: I must have seen it, but yeah, I remember nothing from it, other than that.

358
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:40,096
Speaker 0: But, you know, skipping through this list, at least in America, animated Christmas specials seem to have started in 1964 with a ton of them, like, right?

359
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:42,780
Speaker 0: That was the year that they all started getting made.

360
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,860
Speaker 0: There are a few before that, but like, that is the year that has the most.

361
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,587
Speaker 1: I don't know, is there like, is there like a Howdy Doody one?

362
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:50,072
Speaker 1: Like, what's, what's older, right?

363
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:51,679
Speaker 0: Is there, I don't know.

364
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:57,600
Speaker 0: Walt Disney, uh, '58, they had one that was not super well known, and then everything else was like '80s.

365
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,900
Speaker 1: But it had to be a TV one, we're not talking about movies or, you know, 'cause there have been holiday movies since forever, right?

366
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not talking about holiday movies.

367
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,040
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's a wonderful life or whatever, right?

368
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:12,656
Speaker 0: Let's see, From All of Us to All of You is an animated television Christmas special produced by Walt Disney that aired in 1958 on ABC, so.

369
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:15,480
Speaker 1: Okay.

370
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,740
Speaker 0: That might be the first one of Note in America.

371
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:19,922
Speaker 1: Maybe.

372
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:20,626
Speaker 1: Who knows?

373
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:21,571
Speaker 1: I don't know the history of it.

374
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:23,340
Speaker 1: All I know is that it's a thing, right?

375
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:32,840
Speaker 1: And so, even if, you know, you didn't celebrate whatever holiday, you know, if you watched TV and were a kid in the United States, you saw a bunch of these.

376
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,100
Speaker 1: And some of them you saw every year, and some of them you saw like once, and then you could never see them again.

377
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,579
Speaker 1: It was very difficult until you remembered them in your old age and looked them up on YouTube, and there they are.

378
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,018
Speaker 1: 'Cause someone saved them.

379
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,170
Speaker 1: And there's a whole bunch of them, right?

380
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 1: And all these like Christmas specials.

381
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:57,780
Speaker 1: Now there's a thing, you gotta separate the idea of the Christmas special from just the Christmas episode.

382
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:11,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, like for example- 'Cause pretty much any TV show, absolutely any TV show whatsoever, right, animated or otherwise, that is a long-running TV show, when it got to the holiday times, it had a holiday episode.

383
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,060
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

384
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,586
Speaker 1: You know, or more than one, right?

385
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:17,934
Speaker 1: There's Simpsons Holiday episodes, right?

386
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:20,180
Speaker 1: There's frickin' Seinfeld.

387
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,203
Speaker 1: Cheers!

388
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:26,262
Speaker 1: Fucking, you know, I'm sure there's ones of like- Every Just Saved by the Bell.

389
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:41,800
Speaker 0: literally didn't matter, but to your point, a Christmas episode just takes place during Christmas, but has the tropes, plus a few of the tropes of the show it's in, plus a selection of the grab bag of Christmas tropes that exist out there.

390
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:50,676
Speaker 1: You might also see a holiday episode of a show broadcast outside of the holiday season, just during syndication and reruns.

391
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:52,660
Speaker 1: It's just another episode of the show.

392
00:27:52,920 --> 00:28:01,195
Speaker 0: The listener actually just pointed out in the livestream that, living in the UK, all the American Christmas specials just aired in syndication whenever.

393
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,860
Speaker 0: Like, they were just an episode like every other episode.

394
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,339
Speaker 1: Well, but I mean, if it's something like, you know- So they'd see them for the first time in like July.

395
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:14,526
Speaker 1: But if it's a special, there wasn't a TV show to go with it usually, right?

396
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:17,590
Speaker 1: It's like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the stop motion one.

397
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,737
Speaker 1: It's like, that's not just an episode that syndicates, that's a special one-shot deal.

398
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:25,039
Speaker 1: It's not like an episode of something.

399
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:42,300
Speaker 0: The He-Man Christmas Special is definitely a Christmas special as opposed to just a holiday episode, because the main trope I would say that differentiates the special is it comes more from the tradition of old-time live-action or radio ensemble Christmas specials.

400
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,863
Speaker 0: We get a bunch of people together, usually some celebrities.

401
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:58,660
Speaker 0: They're almost more like variety shows, and they tend to be non-canonical as opposed to the episode that happens within a show that, like, I guess the Christmas episodes of Saved by the Bell are part of the Saved by the Bell canon.

402
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:08,160
Speaker 0: But the He-Man Christmas Special is not part of the canon, because that's He-Man and She-Ra and Skeletor is a good guy, and there's those two kids that you never see again.

403
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:14,600
Speaker 1: Maybe not every Christmas special is a thing that had a show to begin with.

404
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,098
Speaker 0: That is true.

405
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:29,980
Speaker 1: There's this one that I remember a lot for some reason from when I was young that I wasn't able to get any information on until I googled it, and basically it was this California Raisins one.

406
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:34,190
Speaker 0: I don't remember this thing at all.

407
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:37,960
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever saw this until you told me about it, and I found it on YouTube.

408
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:53,960
Speaker 1: So if people don't know about the California Raisins, just really quickly, the raisin people, like the people in California who grow grapes and turn them into raisins, were making advertisements for raisins the same way as dairy farmers have their Got Milk commercials.

409
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,080
Speaker 1: And what happened is they struck gold.

410
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:08,880
Speaker 1: They got this guy, Will Vinton, pretty much all the claymation that you saw in the 80s and possibly early 90s, when claymation was a big deal, was by this Will Vinton guy.

411
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:10,299
Speaker 1: He was like the claymation master.

412
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:25,680
Speaker 1: And they had him make a commercial with these California Raisins, singing, heard it through the grapevine, a song from the Motown days, which was an old song, but that was the first time I heard that song, and it's a great song.

413
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:37,618
Speaker 0: I remember after that was seeing that commercial as a kid, and then when Grandpa got out one of his old 45s that had the actual song on it, and my kid brain was like, "That's a real song?

414
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:38,139
Speaker 0: It's not from a

415
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:38,640
Speaker 0: cartoon?".

416
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:41,735
Speaker 0: And then Grandpa was like, "Here's a pile of records.

417
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:42,539
Speaker 0: You're about to learn about

418
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:42,780
Speaker 0: music.".

419
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:43,781
Speaker 1: Right.

420
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:52,440
Speaker 1: But it's like, I went out and I actually bought California Raisins cassette tape, which was effectively a compilation album of a whole bunch of songs.

421
00:30:54,141 --> 00:31:06,300
Speaker 1: But anyway, they had Will Vinton's claymation Christmas celebration, and I actually, for some reason, my shittier memory remembers this thing, and I think the reason I had a memory of it was for two reasons.

422
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:12,690
Speaker 1: Reason number one is because for some reason, when I was a kid, I really wanted to watch it.

423
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:18,619
Speaker 1: I guess maybe commercials advertising that it was going to be on hyped me up, and I tried to watch it.

424
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:29,320
Speaker 1: And B, I failed to successfully watch all of it, and it was never on again, and so that lingered.

425
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,964
Speaker 1: And secondly, the whole point of this thing, it was much like what Rym suggested.

426
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:50,020
Speaker 1: It's one of those ensemble deals, where it's basically a bunch of really short bits all strung together by this one framing bit of two claymation dinosaurs having a Christmas celebration in the middle of a claymation town.

427
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,205
Speaker 0: That's sort of the common, like, the animated specials.

428
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:54,688
Speaker 0: We're focused on the animated specials.

429
00:31:54,728 --> 00:32:02,420
Speaker 0: They tend to follow that pattern of, it's either a clip show with a framing story, or it's a standalone, non-canonical, like, mini-movie.

430
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,361
Speaker 1: Yep.

431
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:14,740
Speaker 1: So this is a bunch of tiny claymation bits strung together, and they're strung together with this running joke, and the running joke has to do with the "Here We Come A-Wassaling" song, right?

432
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,854
Speaker 1: Which, to me, at the time, was a song I hadn't heard before, right?

433
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:20,520
Speaker 1: And I guess it got stuck in my head.

434
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,228
Speaker 1: But the running joke is that, like, at the beginning of the special, they, yeah, that song, right?

435
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:35,460
Speaker 1: At the beginning of the special, they come with the "Here We Come A-Wassaling," and then they come back again with, like, you know, basically everyone keeps getting the song wrong, right, in between the bits.

436
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:44,880
Speaker 1: And then at the end, after the California Raisins have appeared, which is, like, the climax, like, finally, you know, here's the part you really wanted, the raisins, right, right at the end.

437
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,220
Speaker 0: Holding the big celebrity for the final act at the music festival.

438
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:52,260
Speaker 1: And then after the raisins, they get the song right, and then that's the end, right?

439
00:32:52,980 --> 00:33:04,780
Speaker 1: But now, seeing the thing on YouTube, which is all on YouTube, the YouTube video includes the, you know, the contemporary, like, actual commercial breaks.

440
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:09,137
Speaker 1: If you take the commercial breaks out, the entirety of this thing has to be 15 to 20 minutes.

441
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,160
Speaker 1: Like, it is, there is not much, it's, like, the whole, with the ads, it's not even 30 minutes.

442
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:22,900
Speaker 1: So, there was not much here to this thing, but this is, you know, a perfect example of, like, this is what those holiday specials were like.

443
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,218
Speaker 1: The Star Wars, infamous Star Wars one, was sort of the oddball in being long and terrible, right?

444
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:35,739
Speaker 1: If that thing was 30 minutes, it would probably be great and remembered fondly.

445
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:45,420
Speaker 0: 'Cause, like, the He-Man and She-Ra joint Christmas where Skeletor's a good guy and there's a weird dog and two self-insert generic kids, it's awful.

446
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,980
Speaker 0: But it's within the bounds of awfulness that regular He-Man and She-Ra had.

447
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:58,938
Speaker 0: So, as a kid, it was just great, but kids who saw the Star Wars special, even kids who were into Star Wars were like, "Dad, what the fuck was

448
00:33:58,958 --> 00:33:59,179
Speaker 0: that?".

449
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:00,362
Speaker 1: Yep.

450
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:07,120
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the ones that had the staying power, right, were the ones that didn't have that sort of structure.

451
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:13,940
Speaker 1: Which is really interesting to me, because it's like, hey, they kept making ones with that framing, you know, clip show structure.

452
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,520
Speaker 1: But they're, presumably, were trying to make something that had staying power that they could reuse and make a lot of money off of in the long run.

453
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,639
Speaker 1: The claymation wasn't cheap to do, that's why there wasn't that many minutes of it, right?

454
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:30,280
Speaker 1: So, you know, but they didn't really get to reuse that one that much, did they, right?

455
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,199
Speaker 1: But the Rudolph one they got to reuse, Frosty the Snowman, the movie, quote, movie, they got to reuse that one a whole bunch.

456
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:43,956
Speaker 0: That Frosty the Snowman from 1969, I think we definitely watched that multiple times on Christmas.

457
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:45,060
Speaker 0: Every year we'd watch it.

458
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,429
Speaker 0: It's so sad when he melts and you assume he's dead.

459
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,600
Speaker 0: Spoilers, Santa's also God and brings him back to life.

460
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,581
Speaker 1: Yep.

461
00:34:53,121 --> 00:35:00,959
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, it's like the animation of that for 1969, it's like you would think that that was a regular episode of animation from the 90s.

462
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,255
Speaker 1: Because they spent so much money on it in the 60s.

463
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, that Frosty the Snowman looks great.

464
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:13,540
Speaker 1: It looks great, because they spent a bunch of money animating it and then they just showed the same damn thing over and over again to get their money's worth, right?

465
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:21,860
Speaker 1: But those ones, the ones that succeeded, did not have that structure of the framing story with the, you know, the separate bits.

466
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,194
Speaker 1: They were a whole contained story, right?

467
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:26,640
Speaker 1: Rudolph is a whole story.

468
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

469
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,019
Speaker 1: You know, Peanuts is a whole story.

470
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,520
Speaker 0: And I would say so Rudolph.

471
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,659
Speaker 1: With a really sad Christmas tree that has like one branch with any greenery on it.

472
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:48,020
Speaker 0: So the Rudolph one, the staying power is that it's a good legitimate story that it goes deeper into the lore of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer than most other depictions of Rudolph do.

473
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:58,460
Speaker 0: And for a lot of kids who saw it as their first introduction to Rudolph, I think it's set for them like what Rudolph is like and what that story is about and what that song is about.

474
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 0: Like for my little kid brain, that was the canon Rudolph and anything else was an imposter.

475
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:04,940
Speaker 0: The Charlie Brown one.

476
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,113
Speaker 1: I learned recently that it was actually made in Japan.

477
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,820
Speaker 1: It was outsourced mostly to Japan.

478
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,807
Speaker 0: And it looks phenomenal.

479
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:14,160
Speaker 0: That stop motion is so good.

480
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:22,940
Speaker 1: But the actual artifacts from the production are not in great shape, hard to find, not mostly around.

481
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,200
Speaker 1: There was a whole thing, I gotta find the link again, talking about, you know, how it was made and whatnot.

482
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:37,180
Speaker 0: There are multiple documentaries on like the production process and like the financing and the commercial history of this thing.

483
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,420
Speaker 1: Here it is, The Complicated Man Who Made Rudolph.

484
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,886
Speaker 0: It got a remaster.

485
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:49,941
Speaker 0: They re-scanned it and cleaned it up from the original 35mm back in 2005.

486
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:56,140
Speaker 0: Because the copy we watched over and over again was like a VHS copy of a VHS copy that was recorded from TV.

487
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:05,120
Speaker 0: The Charlie Brown one set so many pop culture tropes in America.

488
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,959
Speaker 0: That sad Christmas tree, everyone knows that Christmas tree.

489
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,840
Speaker 0: It introduced multiple Christmas songs into the lexicon of Christmas music in America.

490
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,240
Speaker 1: Well the music was a different thing, right?

491
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,520
Speaker 1: So what happened was, I've actually read this story on the internet recently.

492
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,720
Speaker 0: The music in it has a whole dedicated Wikipedia article.

493
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,320
Speaker 1: Right, so the guy, there was a guy who was trying to make a documentary about Peanuts, right?

494
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,515
Speaker 1: Because Peanuts was a big deal in the early 60s, right?

495
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,120
Speaker 1: It was big enough to already have a documentary even though there were still decades of Peanuts yet to come.

496
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,898
Speaker 0: I mean in the late 80s, I read Peanuts in the newspaper and my parents were like, "That's not the real

497
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:46,279
Speaker 0: Peanuts.".

498
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,360
Speaker 0: And they had the old, effectively trade paperbacks of like original Peanuts.

499
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,180
Speaker 1: I read those trade paperbacks, they were in my school, they were in my elementary school library.

500
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:03,360
Speaker 0: We owned them all, my parents had the entire run of Peanuts in like yellowed brittle trade paperbacks.

501
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,639
Speaker 1: I think Fanta Graphics might publish them if you want to buy them.

502
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:11,440
Speaker 0: We have pretty much every Mad Magazine from the beginning to like 1980.

503
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,640
Speaker 1: But anyway, there was someone trying to make a Peanuts documentary, and in the course of making the documentary, that guy hooked up with Vince Guaraldi, right?

504
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:21,611
Speaker 1: And Vince Guaraldi wrote the song, right?

505
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:24,040
Speaker 1: The Linus and Lucy song is the main one people know.

506
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,088
Speaker 0: But that Christmas time is here.

507
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:28,640
Speaker 0: song is the one that like everyone remembers now.

508
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,387
Speaker 1: Well, that's the Christmassy one, right?

509
00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:32,980
Speaker 1: But the Linus and Lucy song is the Peanuts-y song, right?

510
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,976
Speaker 1: So the guy heard that, you know, Vince Guaraldi wrote that song, the producer guy heard it and was like, "That's it.

511
00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:41,239
Speaker 1: That's the fucking Peanuts

512
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:41,580
Speaker 1: song.".

513
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,840
Speaker 1: It was obvious to even him at the time that that was the song that was perfect to go with Peanuts.

514
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:50,833
Speaker 1: The documentary didn't happen, right?

515
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,199
Speaker 1: Because otherwise we would have seen it.

516
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:58,820
Speaker 1: But a year after that documentary fell through, they made the Christmas special.

517
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:03,017
Speaker 1: He calls up Vince and he's like, "Vince, I need the music again, right?

518
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:03,218
Speaker 1: Let's

519
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:03,439
Speaker 1: go.".

520
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:05,326
Speaker 1: And that's how it happened.

521
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:11,870
Speaker 1: And then that music, it wasn't like, you know, I was never... The reason I looked this up is because I wasn't sure.

522
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:16,728
Speaker 1: I was like, did Vince just, you know, in his trio, did they make that music independently?

523
00:39:16,848 --> 00:39:20,280
Speaker 1: and then it happened to get co-opted like the California Raisins?

524
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,475
Speaker 1: Or did he write the music for... No, he wrote the music for Peanuts.

525
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:27,120
Speaker 1: That was the original, right?

526
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:38,380
Speaker 0: And I just want to point out the album for that music, the album that debuted that music officially as far as like music being released into the wild on vinyl is concerned.

527
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:41,329
Speaker 0: It went quintuple platinum.

528
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,037
Speaker 0: As of 2022, it has sold five...

529
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:44,860
Speaker 1: That's a lot of platinum.

530
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, five million copies.

531
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:48,478
Speaker 1: How many of you got to sell to be quintuple platinum?

532
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:48,800
Speaker 1: Millions?

533
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,082
Speaker 0: Five millions.

534
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:51,567
Speaker 1: Five millions.

535
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:55,560
Speaker 1: That's a lot of... In 1960-something, that's a lot of vinyl to sell.

536
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,140
Speaker 0: It is the tenth best-selling Christmas or holiday album in the United States ever during the SoundScan era.

537
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

538
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:08,020
Speaker 0: Because what music is popular is very hard to determine in the current era.

539
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,875
Speaker 1: Well, let's see how many streams Spotify claims it has.

540
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:12,999
Speaker 0: That would be interesting to see.

541
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,167
Speaker 0: According to... I mean, I listened to this like five times.

542
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:31,980
Speaker 1: If you go to Spotify and you find the album, a Charlie Brown Christmas 2012 remastered and expanded edition, and you look at the track titled "Christmas Time is Here Vocal", right, as opposed to the instrumental one.

543
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:36,829
Speaker 1: It has, according to Spotify, 129 million and a half a million plays.

544
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:43,465
Speaker 1: Alright.

545
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:44,531
Speaker 1: As of right now.

546
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:46,160
Speaker 1: That's a lot of plays.

547
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,057
Speaker 0: I mean, I listened to it a few times today at work while I was working on stuff.

548
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:53,260
Speaker 0: I fucking love this album.

549
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:54,202
Speaker 1: Right.

550
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,807
Speaker 1: Let's compare that to... Okay.

551
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:03,460
Speaker 1: So, let's look at Drake, one of the most popular living musicians, period, right?

552
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,048
Speaker 1: Drake's Hittest of Hit Songs have, you know, more.

553
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:08,208
Speaker 1: Okay.

554
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,010
Speaker 1: 300 and a half... 350 million plays.

555
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:20,973
Speaker 1: So, Drake's only ahead of Vince by 2X, right?

556
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,336
Speaker 1: So, he's half a Drake.

557
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:24,160
Speaker 1: That's still pretty up there.

558
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,661
Speaker 0: Yup.

559
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:36,520
Speaker 0: And I think we talked about this once a long time ago in a different context, but when we talk about "Home Alone", but it is rare in America to introduce a brand new Christmas song that becomes a Christmas classic.

560
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,410
Speaker 0: Like, it happens, and it happens pretty regularly.

561
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:41,620
Speaker 1: I think the last one I can think of is Mariah Carey.

562
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,987
Speaker 0: I was about to say, that's the last one I can think of.

563
00:41:44,308 --> 00:41:46,855
Speaker 0: But Vince Guaraldi and Peanuts did it.

564
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:48,460
Speaker 0: The Home Alone movie did it.

565
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,504
Speaker 0: There's not many things that can say.

566
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:57,280
Speaker 0: they added a new canonical, popularly known, like, classic Christmas song to the American lexicon.

567
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:01,958
Speaker 1: Now, the thing is, you know, I'd say, "Oh, they're not making these Christmas specials

568
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,320
Speaker 1: anymore.".

569
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,264
Speaker 0: Well, they definitely are.

570
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,110
Speaker 1: But they definitely are, actually.

571
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,700
Speaker 1: There's a lot of, like, popular recent-ish ones.

572
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,614
Speaker 1: I think there's, like, a Shrek one, and there might be a Frozen one, I think.

573
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:13,240
Speaker 1: There's, like, an Olaf Frozen one, I think.

574
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:22,520
Speaker 0: Oh, so this isn't relevant to this show, and I'm going to use this as the thing of the day on another episode, but did you see the thing with the Hallmark movie where they released the same movie twice?

575
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:24,359
Speaker 0: No.

576
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:30,256
Speaker 0: So, they made a Christmas special, one of those throwaway Hallmark movies about, like, two sisters.

577
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:31,800
Speaker 0: It's called, like, Sister Swap Something.

578
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:33,626
Speaker 0: So, there's two movies that were released.

579
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:37,540
Speaker 0: Sister Swap and, like, Sister Swap Christmas Something.

580
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:49,020
Speaker 0: They are literally the same movie, just, they did the same principle photography from the same script, and then they're just edited slightly differently, and they just released them as two separate movies.

581
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:50,520
Speaker 1: Same actors?

582
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,003
Speaker 0: Same actors, same scenes.

583
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:57,900
Speaker 0: The scenes are just in a slightly different order, and, like, some of the dialogue is cut or shortened or moved around.

584
00:42:58,261 --> 00:43:03,040
Speaker 0: It's like they just Warrior of the Wind-ed this movie into two different versions, and Dan Harmon...

585
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,720
Speaker 1: Most people would never see both, so why not?

586
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:20,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, Dan Harmon was like, "I watched these movies because I thought Hallmark tried to make a Sister Swap universe, and I wanted to see what the canon was of this universe, and what I discovered was so terrifying that I have to tell you

587
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:20,880
Speaker 0: all.".

588
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:27,820
Speaker 1: But, yeah, no, the point is there are new ones, and I think they are a hit with the people who are watching them, right?

589
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,909
Speaker 1: Absolutely, I mean, the ones we remember... And the quality levels, the quality levels are up, right?

590
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,540
Speaker 1: Because they are still getting a larger budget, right?

591
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:49,820
Speaker 1: It's like they spent more money on, you know, this than, like, some episode of a... But the thing that I think is, that's basically changed is that no matter how good any of these are that anyone makes today, even though they might make some phenomenal ones, right?

592
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:59,772
Speaker 1: They are going to have a hard time making one that becomes some sort of, you know, enduring tradition, because you can just watch them whenever the fuck you want.

593
00:43:59,812 --> 00:44:01,240
Speaker 1: You can watch them ten times, right?

594
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:13,100
Speaker 1: It's like, there isn't that sort of, "You can only watch this on the holiday, whole family gathers around every holiday," unless the family brings the intent on their own, their own initiative, right?

595
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,199
Speaker 0: Now I have a question for you, because I don't know the answer to this.

596
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:28,200
Speaker 0: Two generations from now, will the staying power of the old ones that people like us imprinted on, because we grew up pre-streaming and pre-digital, will that just disappear and it's just a long tail of Christmassy stuff?

597
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:30,183
Speaker 1: I think it will.

598
00:44:30,283 --> 00:44:40,838
Speaker 1: I don't think it will disappear, but I think what will happen is it will basically go down to the level of the other ones, because they're just going, like I said, the Peanuts ones are on Apple TV+, right?

599
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:41,260
Speaker 1: All of them.

600
00:44:41,621 --> 00:44:51,620
Speaker 1: So you still, you know, nowadays, if you're going to have a new family and you're going to watch that, you need that initiative, the same initiative to watch the Shrek one or the Frozen one.

601
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:55,060
Speaker 1: So to watch, you know, they're all on an even playing field now.

602
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:00,360
Speaker 0: So we're going to break up along the cultural lines of what streaming services do parents pay for every given year?

603
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,780
Speaker 1: What streaming service does your, right, does your family have?

604
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,116
Speaker 1: And then how old are the parents who are, you know, sitting the kids down to watch?

605
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:09,480
Speaker 1: and do the kids even care?

606
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:17,220
Speaker 0: I am confident my brother is showing my two young nephews the Peanuts Christmas thing.

607
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:18,942
Speaker 1: Right.

608
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:26,500
Speaker 1: So that's the thing is like, all right, so if you're, if millennials are showing whatever millennial children are, Peanuts ones, right?

609
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:33,777
Speaker 1: It's like, are those kids going to also show their kids the Peanuts one after we're dead or will they not?

610
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:35,622
Speaker 1: Right.

611
00:45:35,662 --> 00:45:39,160
Speaker 1: Well, it's like, you know, so it's that's what's going to happen.

612
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,874
Speaker 1: But you got to assume over time it can only fade.

613
00:45:42,175 --> 00:45:43,100
Speaker 1: How can it pick up steam?

614
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,290
Speaker 1: I don't see any way for it to grow.

615
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,340
Speaker 1: I only see a way for it to fade.

616
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,620
Speaker 0: Also, Christmas specials get bucketed because if I think about all the ones I remembered, there's only two categories.

617
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:02,299
Speaker 0: The only ones that get remembered and talked about are the ones that are so bad they're notable or the ones that are legitimate platinum classics for all time.

618
00:46:03,785 --> 00:46:05,180
Speaker 0: Nothing in between gets remembered.

619
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:20,220
Speaker 1: But I think thankfully, you know, it seems like that quite a bunch of these, even strange, obscure, you know, unknown, weird ones, there does seem to be, you know, somewhat OK preservation of them.

620
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,408
Speaker 1: Like there I saw a lot just on YouTube.

621
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:24,857
Speaker 1: I've seen, you know, you saw the Rudolph, the big one.

622
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:25,800
Speaker 1: Rudolph got restored.

623
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:26,502
Speaker 1: Right.

624
00:46:26,562 --> 00:46:34,178
Speaker 1: It's like they're because the budgets on the originals were good and they were shown or at least were intended to be shown year after year.

625
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:35,562
Speaker 1: Right.

626
00:46:35,823 --> 00:46:40,198
Speaker 1: I think there was, you know, we're not losing these, you know, even ones from, you know, the 60s.

627
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,525
Speaker 1: You know, I'm sure some have been lost.

628
00:46:42,605 --> 00:46:47,940
Speaker 0: I mean, the He-Man one is up on the official YouTube channel for Masters of the Universe legitimately.

629
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:48,821
Speaker 0: Yeah.

630
00:46:48,881 --> 00:47:01,020
Speaker 1: It's like just from an outside perspective, it seems like the preservation of these specials in particular is greater relative to the preservation of other, you know, media of the same time periods.

631
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:03,106
Speaker 1: Right.

632
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:06,639
Speaker 1: So whichever ones people want to choose will be available to them.

633
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,141
Speaker 0: Yep.

634
00:47:07,582 --> 00:47:13,580
Speaker 0: So of the American cartoons that aren't a classic of all time standalone, like the Rudolph one or the thing with the Snow Miser.

635
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:30,040
Speaker 0: I think the two types, just as I look through this list, are either the ensemble clip show like we discussed or the other very common one that is, I think, the most common among the shows we forget about are the Oh, no, something happened to Santa.

636
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:31,963
Speaker 0: Fred Flintstone has to save.

637
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:33,986
Speaker 0: Oh, no, something happened to Santa.

638
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:36,350
Speaker 0: Inspector Gadget has to save the day.

639
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,893
Speaker 0: Like it's that specific story.

640
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:39,355
Speaker 0: Something happened to Santa.

641
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:41,559
Speaker 0: Someone else has to do Santa's job.

642
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:42,420
Speaker 0: They succeed.

643
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,774
Speaker 1: It's either something happened to Santa or something happened to, you know, Christmas looks like it's going to be miserable.

644
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:49,616
Speaker 1: We don't have food.

645
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:50,638
Speaker 1: We don't have presents.

646
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:51,560
Speaker 1: Something is bad.

647
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:59,260
Speaker 1: And then, you know, people are, you know, people who were nice are mean, but then at the end of the episode, even the villains are nice, right?

648
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:09,480
Speaker 0: Even Skeletor saves the kids and gets licked by the puppy at the end of the He-Man and She-Rock Christmas Special, which is fascinating because canonically the next episode after that, he resumes trying to commit genocide.

649
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:10,520
Speaker 1: Right.

650
00:48:10,581 --> 00:48:12,086
Speaker 1: It's like even, you know, Jetsons, right?

651
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:12,908
Speaker 1: It's like even Mr.

652
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:16,440
Speaker 1: Spacely becomes generous like a, you know, fucking Christmas Carol.

653
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:17,561
Speaker 1: Right.

654
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:29,253
Speaker 0: You know, so you also get very often the trope that's so American of Santa's not necessarily real.

655
00:48:29,293 --> 00:48:30,915
Speaker 0: It was the spirit and whatever.

656
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:35,600
Speaker 0: But then there's the thing that happens at the end where like someone's like, but isn't that Santa right up there?

657
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:37,640
Speaker 0: And you get a cameo of real Santa.

658
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:38,801
Speaker 1: Yep.

659
00:48:40,224 --> 00:48:46,980
Speaker 1: The one, the very final second of the, whatever it is, is always aha, real Santa, wink, wink, the end.

660
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,192
Speaker 0: So interestingly, anime has a very strong tradition of Christmas episodes, too.

661
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:58,640
Speaker 0: And I pulled up a bunch to remember them, to talk about them on this show episode of Geek Nights.

662
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:08,340
Speaker 0: And what I would say is if you look at all the anime Christmas specials, they're very similar, but they have their own set of tropes that are not the American tropes.

663
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:14,396
Speaker 0: They see, they almost always have a character dresses up as Santa, but nobody's fooled.

664
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:15,820
Speaker 0: Like they're not trying to fool anyone.

665
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,462
Speaker 0: They're usually love stories.

666
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:35,500
Speaker 0: Like all the ones I could find that I remembered are the plot is primarily characters who are having an on again, off again, or some sort of romantic situation in the regular show have a moment or almost get together or resolve some piece of that during the Christmas episode.

667
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:40,319
Speaker 0: Like they go out to dinner, there's the Rhonda one, the KOR one.

668
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:45,729
Speaker 1: The other thing that happens a lot is it's just a normal old episode of the show.

669
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:51,500
Speaker 1: It's not like a, you know, but it happens to include something Christmassy in it.

670
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,200
Speaker 1: Right?

671
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,267
Speaker 1: Like, you know, you'll have a messenger, which we already talked about earlier in the show, right?

672
00:49:56,287 --> 00:50:04,040
Speaker 1: But it's like, there are other robot shows I've seen or, you know, sports shows where it's like, yep, it's just an episode of the show.

673
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:10,080
Speaker 1: It fits right in with the rest of the show, but it happens to take place during Christmas.

674
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,500
Speaker 1: Right?

675
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,573
Speaker 1: It's a sports anime and there's a, they had to, they battle in the, in the snow.

676
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:18,620
Speaker 1: or, you know, there's a robot dressed as Santa Claus.

677
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,180
Speaker 0: But then you've got like Kima Gurudora's Road or Tenchi or like a lot of those Ranma where the Christmas episode.

678
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,690
Speaker 1: Well, the Ranma one was like a special Christmas OVA, right?

679
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,500
Speaker 1: It wasn't just a regular old episode in with the rest of the show.

680
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:40,640
Speaker 0: There's a couple different Ranma Christmases depending on what we're talking about, but they, that special, the specials seem to often do something that wasn't in the manga.

681
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:49,640
Speaker 0: If a show is based on the manga and like push a romance further than the rest of the show ever did, usually never to be spoken of again in the next episode.

682
00:50:51,960 --> 00:51:03,160
Speaker 0: And there's a few that are set in a Christmas-like thing, like the Sailor Moon S-movie just happens to be set during Christmas, but it's just a Sailor Moon movie.

683
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,735
Speaker 0: There's the Tenchi Muyo, the second movie, just happens to be set during Jirai and Holiday.

684
00:51:10,795 --> 00:51:12,780
Speaker 0: that is functionally identical to Christmas.

685
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,360
Speaker 1: There's the Big O, Big O Christmas.

686
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:19,506
Speaker 0: Oh God, yeah, the Big O Christmas.

687
00:51:20,028 --> 00:51:24,320
Speaker 0: But the Big O Christmas is a deeply canonical direct plot continuance.

688
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,181
Speaker 1: Exactly.

689
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:36,620
Speaker 1: It's like, it's a really good Christmas episode, but it's like, it's just, you know, it's not like super, you know, it's not like a Christmas special, right?

690
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:47,580
Speaker 1: It's just an episode of the show and it takes place during Christmas and Christmas matters a lot to the episode, you know, both figuratively and, you know, whatever, and literally.

691
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,260
Speaker 1: But it doesn't stand alone as like some Christmas special with, you know, this Christmas formula or whatever, right?

692
00:51:54,761 --> 00:52:11,840
Speaker 0: So yeah, if you have never seen some of these animated shows that we talk about, I'd say it is absolutely worth your while, no matter who you are, to watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special if you never have, and to watch the stop-motion animated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer if you never had.

693
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, for some reason, it's like, yeah, the enduring ones endured for a reason, like they have quality to them, right?

694
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:19,731
Speaker 1: The Frosty one.

695
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,743
Speaker 1: The Frosty one.

696
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:25,515
Speaker 0: Don't actually watch the Skeletor He-Man Christmas.

697
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,240
Speaker 0: It is not actually good.

698
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:38,939
Speaker 1: You don't actually need to watch the Claymation one unless you, or the Star Wars one or whatever, unless you're just the kind of person who likes watching weird old animated things, right?

699
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,820
Speaker 0: But like, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

700
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,520
Speaker 1: You want to be impressed by the claymation technique or something.

701
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:51,180
Speaker 0: If Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer were just on TV, it never existed before, and appeared this Christmas, I think it would be extremely popular.

702
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

703
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:54,040
Speaker 1: Why not?

704
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,506
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

705
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:03,560
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

707
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:11,888
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

708

711
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:27,600

713
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:50,279
Speaker 0: I'm really hungry, and I got a lot to do tonight, so I'm just going to stop right now.

714
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,620
Speaker 0: We will very likely actually do shows next week, and then who knows what's going to happen in January.

715
00:53:56,101 --> 00:54:05,980
Speaker 0: So for right now, I leave you with a very important thing that you should listen to, and you can probably guess what it is in advance based on what we talked about in the show.

716
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:11,360
Speaker 0: And you're probably guessing it's something related to those terrible Christmas specials, and you're absolutely wrong.

717
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:13,655
Speaker 0: So here it is.

718
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:47,784
Speaker 1: (singing in Japanese).

719
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,194
Speaker 1: (singing in Japanese).

720
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,039
Speaker 1: (singing in Japanese).
