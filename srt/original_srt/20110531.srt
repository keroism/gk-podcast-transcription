1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,817
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday May 31st 2011.

2
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:13,962
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:17,270
Speaker 0: two great warm-up games Rico and battle lines.

4
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:22,985
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:31,021
Speaker 0: Warm today.

6
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,691
Speaker 0: Oh Mr..

7
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,113
Speaker 1: D.

8
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:34,718
Speaker 0: Even warmer today.

9
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:36,904
Speaker 1: actually it's the perfect warmness.

10
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:38,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it.

11
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:38,610
Speaker 0: It's good weather.

12
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:43,570
Speaker 1: I even I feel like you should only say warm today when it's so it actually is warmer.

13
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:49,390
Speaker 1: But you see if you're gonna turn on the air conditioner you can say warm today Just like you only say you only say woman if you're cold.

14
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,755
Speaker 1: I have the air conditioner on.

15
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,321
Speaker 0: I don't I've had my part.

16
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:54,790
Speaker 0: well the thing is my building for whatever reason just gets hotter.

17
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:02,102
Speaker 0: I think it's the like the big windows and all the rooms, but yeah if the AC is off It's like 80 something degrees in here.

18
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:02,825
Speaker 1: I only get pretty.

19
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:08,722
Speaker 1: I only get hot if Like all the electronic computers are on and the windows are closed.

20
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:11,170
Speaker 0: Oh well this room in particular the geek night studio.

21
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,390
Speaker 0: I basically shut the door and leave the AC on all the time.

22
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:23,465
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm though a lot of you know Scott put up that counter-strike server the other day cuz mine has been out of commission for like Months yeah, but my internets was so it couldn't handle it, but we can't.

23
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:24,389
Speaker 1: it was just fun.

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we can't swap PCs cuz it's not just a random PC.

25
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:28,829
Speaker 0: It's actually Scott's HD PC.

26
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:30,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not gonna remove it I was just.

27
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:35,706
Speaker 1: you know it's the perfect computer to use for a counter-strike server cuz like it's not good.

28
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:36,990
Speaker 0: We're not home exactly.

29
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,359
Speaker 1: It's like if I'm not watching TV on it.

30
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,725
Speaker 0: I'm playing counter-strike.

31
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:42,010
Speaker 0: What else would I do right?

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,142
Speaker 1: So it's you know what better place what better computer to get dual purpose to?

33
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:48,950
Speaker 1: you know use it more efficiently and not waste.

34
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:58,170
Speaker 1: waste it then to use it as a gaming server when you're not watching something in your home theater, but My internet is so slow that when we got to like with ten players

35
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:03,152
Speaker 0: It was weird like we were playing okay, and then once we got to about eight players pings went up But it was still playable.

36
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:16,610
Speaker 0: my ping was like 20 instead of 10 yeah, but then ten players came in and Basically I didn't have any problems because I was on the gigabit Ethernet's on the same.

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,589
Speaker 0: Well, I had a ping of a thousand and I my ping is still five.

38
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:24,329
Speaker 1: I don't know why it's five to go across the room doubted me.

39
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,903
Speaker 0: I told you you need that anti griefing stuff installed because Scott's like.

40
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:30,929
Speaker 1: oh the game has its own built-in.

41
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,253
Speaker 0: It doesn't work.

42
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:32,795
Speaker 1: It does.

43
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:38,237
Speaker 1: It's if you team kill too soon, or if you team kill too many times You're automatically banned.

44
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,522
Speaker 0: It doesn't work that well.

45
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:41,110
Speaker 0: There are better ways to do it.

46
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:44,444
Speaker 1: I could have adjusted the numbers like have zero tolerance.

47
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,990
Speaker 1: like one team kill your band forever.

48
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,692
Speaker 0: No, because team kills happen And you want that.

49
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,679
Speaker 1: I know but it what it does.

50
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:56,363
Speaker 1: you can set a number of seconds where it's the start of the match And if anyone team kills in that frame it counts against.

51
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:57,367
Speaker 0: ah but team kill.

52
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,010
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

53
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:08,689
Speaker 0: There's a good mod that handles this really well, and it while I generally like to play absolutely pure counter-strike I'm okay with a handful of mods that were on the the SMD server that I play it on all the time which get this.

54
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:12,310
Speaker 0: When you post in that thread like yeah, I gotta find a good counter-strike server.

55
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:17,525
Speaker 0: I've only played on one counter-strike server for like six or seven months.

56
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:18,588
Speaker 1: Send me the IP that shit.

57
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:19,150
Speaker 1: It's gone.

58
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,610
Speaker 0: Oh, I went in I went in and it wasn't in my favorites anymore.

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,434
Speaker 0: It's just not there.

60
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:26,670
Speaker 0: so I gotta find wherever it moved to and I couldn't find it so far.

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,610
Speaker 1: Well, if there are no people out there, right?

62
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:35,010
Speaker 1: I mean like, you know, I tend to play counter-strike in phases like I played a whole bunch I'm probably gonna play it tonight and then I don't play it and then I played a whole bunch.

63
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,420
Speaker 0: You know every months years whatever as much as I want to play it tonight I want to get to certain pony related thing done.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,210
Speaker 1: Alright, but the other thing, you know, it's like, you know I think I've entered a counter-strike phase.

65
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,935
Speaker 0: Well, I think we played a lot more if we have a dedicated server because once Scott turned on the all talk and it was All listeners hanging out.

66
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:55,128
Speaker 0: It's pretty fun to play counter-strike with a bunch of people.

67
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:55,369
Speaker 0: it is.

68
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:03,490
Speaker 1: But the thing is is like if I if we pay for a dedicated server We pay for game server hosting which is 75 cents a slot at the cheapest for counter-strike source.

69
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,907
Speaker 0: How much per year per hour per?

70
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,589
Speaker 1: It's 75 cents if they based it on slots per month.

71
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:12,762
Speaker 0: Oh, that's actually not that bad because it's not.

72
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:24,404
Speaker 1: you have to pay more if you want like a like a 100 tick or 500 FPS server and then you pay per slot and you also pay more for counter-strike source than you do for regular counters like yeah six

73
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:27,090
Speaker 0: But it is kind of a pain in the ass.

74
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:35,110
Speaker 1: These these game hosting things though What they do give you is they basically give you an easy web interface like enable mods and that sort of stuff.

75
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:43,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, because base counter-strike vanilla counter-strike cake to run you just install like the Linux command-line dedicated server and it pretty much just works.

76
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,650
Speaker 0: It won't be great, but it'll just was really annoying.

77
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:54,330
Speaker 1: so I made a steam account and I opened up steam and I double clicked on server and Installed and then I double clicked on it to run it and it looked like it was running but it totally didn't work.

78
00:04:54,751 --> 00:05:01,150
Speaker 1: So then I got the HLDS update tool for Windows, which basically lets you run the counter-strike server without steam.

79
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,098
Speaker 0: That's what you want and it totally worked.

80
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,910
Speaker 1: and I was like why the fuck don't they just make it work in steam?

81
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,437
Speaker 1: It was like the same GUI and everything.

82
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:11,170
Speaker 0: I was like what are the point mod developers for counter-strike servers?

83
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,849
Speaker 0: They're just the community is a little too hardcore old-school.

84
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,709
Speaker 0: So the tools are all really obtuse and pain in the ass to maintain.

85
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:26,738
Speaker 1: and yeah But if you get some of these game hose game server hosting places They say at least I can't tell how legit.

86
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:30,630
Speaker 1: they are from their websites, but they say like one-click mod installation.

87
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:35,350
Speaker 1: So I'm sure it's they've set up stuff to make it easier to administrate because that's their business.

88
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,382
Speaker 0: Well, you know, we'll put it this way.

89
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,815
Speaker 1: if they're legit I can't really tell.

90
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:43,145
Speaker 1: it seems like there's a bunch of them that are actually all the same Company on different domains with different looking sites.

91
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:49,186
Speaker 0: this week sometime I'll try to get my counter-strike server back up because I can host like 20 on 20 with the FiOS.

92
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:50,752
Speaker 1: just fine 20 on 20.

93
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,695
Speaker 0: I could do that.

94
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:59,070
Speaker 0: the computer step computers powerful enough for that computer might not be that powerful But the other computer is even more broken than this one.

95
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,701
Speaker 0: This one's an old computer, but I think it'll work.

96
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,826
Speaker 1: We just need 10 on 10.

97
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:04,816
Speaker 1: We don't need 20 on 20 Yeah, and then we just.

98
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:06,950
Speaker 1: we basically just need regular counter-strike.

99
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:13,708
Speaker 1: This is the thing is I didn't want to set up my own server But I couldn't find a server that had a regular map rotation.

100
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:29,476
Speaker 1: every server I found was either a a weird mod like gun game or surf and I like gun game but I don't want to play gun game all the time or they were 24/7 like dust to 24/7 office 24/7 and I was like sure if I want to play office But I don't want to play only office.

101
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:31,605
Speaker 1: I want to play all the maps in a rotation.

102
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:33,030
Speaker 1: all the default maps.

103
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,597
Speaker 1: No weird cut I do.

104
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:37,350
Speaker 0: there are a couple of non-standard maps that are fucking off.

105
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know which ones ones that are updates of the old maps that aren't in counter-strike stores.

106
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,050
Speaker 0: There are some original maps.

107
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:43,895
Speaker 0: I have a map pack.

108
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:45,102
Speaker 0: It was from the SMD server.

109
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,450
Speaker 0: They had a fantastic rotation.

110
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:52,690
Speaker 0: Basically the deal with them was that they had you know The admins and the people who were like kind of tight in that little community.

111
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:58,010
Speaker 0: They did for the for the clan what we used to do for AMVs back at RIT anime.

112
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,968
Speaker 0: They play every shitty ass map ever and they only put into the rotation the absolute most fun.

113
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:05,995
Speaker 0: best of the best Yeah.

114
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:07,936
Speaker 1: But the point is I want to.

115
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:12,635
Speaker 1: I want to play all the regular default maps that are built into the game and hardly Any server is.

116
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:28,370
Speaker 1: no server that I could find actually Ran a map rotation that included more than one of the default maps all Fox no items TMP only exactly It's like I want to play, you know assault or militia or whatever and this is the best.

117
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,770
Speaker 1: No one was running, you know, and I want to play like give me an update of oil rig or some shit.

118
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,094
Speaker 1: You know, I couldn't find anything.

119
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:35,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's one map.

120
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:36,000
Speaker 0: You'll really like.

121
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,890
Speaker 0: it looks like one six, but it's in source called Westwood.

122
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:51,196
Speaker 0: It's just this totally old-school contrived Wild-west kind of village with the shootout and it's got all that kind of jank ass shit that you'd see plus this all those I want to play all the maps that no one remembers.

123
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:56,010
Speaker 1: mansion Arab mansion, you know, there's plenty old man or back alley.

124
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:58,439
Speaker 0: Do you remember how to make Gordon Freeman's ghost come out?

125
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:10,610
Speaker 0: I never succeeded to make those come out of the pool table but anyway or Vegas right I will admit that Gordon Freeman's goes coming out of the pool table Scared the ever-living shit out of me the first time it happened.

126
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,550
Speaker 1: The point is I want today I'm gonna try to play cs 1.6 and see if I find any server is doing a map.

127
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,103
Speaker 0: You're not gonna enjoy one six, why not cuz source is better.

128
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:20,067
Speaker 1: I'll find out.

129
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:20,970
Speaker 0: today is better.

130
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,635
Speaker 0: It's two more.

131
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:31,410
Speaker 0: that doesn't cost me anything to find out Yeah, but by the end of the week I'm gonna try to get cobble together and get my counter-strike server going again, but I'm not gonna do anything fancy with it.

132
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,722
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna get it re-going and I'll post the IP once it's up.

133
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:39,198
Speaker 1: if that doesn't work or if it fails Somehow we should consider and we keep playing.

134
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:42,169
Speaker 1: we should consider paying for one if enough people like contribute.

135
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:49,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I'll set up because I can take Donations actually some or some but no some of these are.

136
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:55,870
Speaker 1: no these server places Actually have like clan donation things as part of the stuff.

137
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,840
Speaker 1: So it's like you can have it built into the server.

138
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:01,470
Speaker 1: the ability for people to help you pay for the server.

139
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right We'll see.

140
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:09,809
Speaker 1: but like people donate money to you And I think it goes directly to the people you're paying for the hosting and adds credit to your account.

141
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:24,226
Speaker 0: Of course at the same time if I have a faster computer They've ever get it fixed or if I buy a new computer or whatever I could run a pretty badass counter-strike server here and I feel like if I pay someone to host anything I'm kind of wasting my FiOS Cuz it's wicked fast.

142
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,233
Speaker 0: Oh, yep Well, yeah this weekend.

143
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:27,798
Speaker 0: I was a mountain climbing.

144
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:31,550
Speaker 0: All right, I climb Mount Whiteface in the Adirondacks.

145
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:34,914
Speaker 1: Okay, I will.

146
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:40,432
Speaker 1: I will make the thing where I say I could make a joke and not make a joke about racism Racism.

147
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:43,180
Speaker 0: I thought you're gonna make some sort of semen joke white face.

148
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,661
Speaker 1: Yeah.

149
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:43,862
Speaker 1: Yeah.

150
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:53,172
Speaker 0: Anyway white face as opposed to black face Yeah, so I was carrying my burden up white face mountain And I won't.

151
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,095
Speaker 0: it was a fun hike.

152
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,304
Speaker 0: I mean you obviously don't care about mountain climbing.

153
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:58,808
Speaker 0: not really couldn't do it.

154
00:09:58,888 --> 00:09:59,330
Speaker 0: you're worse.

155
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:02,106
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, pretty much.

156
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,469
Speaker 0: But we were gonna climb out Marcy, which is more than a mile up.

157
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:24,947
Speaker 0: But there was a thunderstorm and a lot of rain and to make a long story short We had to hike down white face many miles Basically going pretty much straight down over rocks with torrential rain and water just pouring over our feet and mud everywhere it was.

158
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:27,682
Speaker 0: It was intense and kind of grueling.

159
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,210
Speaker 0: Yeah great fun.

160
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,274
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

161
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:32,776
Speaker 0: All right.

162
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:35,910
Speaker 0: So speaking of counter-strike, I guess it's Tuesday.

163
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:37,596
Speaker 1: I guess yeah, let's see.

164
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:39,562
Speaker 1: There's not really actually a lot of gaming news.

165
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,938
Speaker 0: Ah, I Kind of disagree with that statement.

166
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,493
Speaker 1: But all right, like I couldn't find any gaming news We're talking about.

167
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:48,304
Speaker 0: so since you think it is a slow news day in the gaming world.

168
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,730
Speaker 0: What is your news?

169
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,009
Speaker 0: What is like the most exciting thing you found?

170
00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:01,406
Speaker 1: Well, apparently right because the 3ds is out Even though the 3ds came out and there were like no games for it and there still aren't any games for it And no one's been talking about the 3ds.

171
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:02,613
Speaker 1: It's been.

172
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:06,847
Speaker 1: it's like it came out an explosion and then it's been quiet ever since didn't really explode.

173
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:07,670
Speaker 0: it kind of simmered.

174
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:08,957
Speaker 1: No, yeah, I know.

175
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,305
Speaker 1: It's it's not even simmered.

176
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,170
Speaker 1: It was like completely.

177
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,768
Speaker 1: What's the word for when you put out a fire?

178
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,017
Speaker 0: Doused now, well the Trump.

179
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:18,850
Speaker 0: think about this though when the GS was first announced, right?

180
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,723
Speaker 0: There were no games for it and other than hardcore people.

181
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,550
Speaker 0: No one bought it right away.

182
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:33,980
Speaker 1: But anyway, because the 3ds is out the DS light is gonna drop in price on June 5th Which is a few days from now to $99.

183
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,597
Speaker 1: if you don't already have a DS or DS light you should buy one.

184
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,428
Speaker 1: why as soon as the price goes down?

185
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:47,645
Speaker 1: because Because why it's something that's gonna last you Forever pretty much.

186
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:48,992
Speaker 1: It's pretty much it's gonna be.

187
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:49,796
Speaker 1: it's one of those things.

188
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,700
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awesome.

189
00:11:50,801 --> 00:12:00,593
Speaker 1: I mean a GBA is still pretty damn good at this point a DS light Even if you buy it now, if you don't have one and you get one of those piracy cards You're gonna be rocking it for many years, right?

190
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:09,500
Speaker 1: I mean I got every NES every You know Gameboy every Gameboy Color game ever and a whole bunch of DS games and a whole bunch of GBA games.

191
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:14,364
Speaker 1: And you know, it's just this portable thing that can hold some Ridiculous number of games.

192
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,293
Speaker 0: and see this is why Nintendo's not making any money anymore.

193
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,600
Speaker 0: pirates like you pirating all their games.

194
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:22,455
Speaker 1: You know how many DS games I've bought a lot.

195
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:22,816
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:32,960
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually, I think more important than owning the ones I pirate I would not have is owning a Gameboy Advance because that's the last one That'll play games all the way back to the beginning.

197
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,317
Speaker 1: Well, if you get an SP, then you can play games all the way back to the beginning.

198
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,978
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, actually, did you remember this?

199
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,561
Speaker 1: I can't.

200
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:45,318
Speaker 1: I didn't realize remember that this existed until like a couple weeks ago the Gameboy player for the GV for the Gamecube.

201
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,829
Speaker 0: I Remember that pretty well because like I remember the super IT.

202
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,109
Speaker 0: Yeah.

203
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,537
Speaker 1: I remember the super Gameboy for the SNES.

204
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:54,967
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but the Gameboy player for the game.

205
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,077
Speaker 1: I totally forgot it existed until recently.

206
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:05,540
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid It's just there's something stupid about kids, but I really wanted the Gameboy player for the Super Nintendo.

207
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,804
Speaker 0: Like I'm the Super Gameboy.

208
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:09,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I really really wanted it.

209
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:20,831
Speaker 0: And when I think back I owned a Gameboy and I can't imagine why I would have wanted it because there was no game on the Gameboy I wanted to play at that point.

210
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:22,180
Speaker 1: Well, cuz what it did, right?

211
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,945
Speaker 1: So the Super Gameboy did two things.

212
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,832
Speaker 0: you have the background around.

213
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:37,540
Speaker 1: some know some of the games had built in Super Gameboy Enhancements that would put orders around the game on the TV and also you could choose from among three or four different color palettes.

214
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:40,140
Speaker 1: Right now the Gameboy color, right?

215
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,999
Speaker 1: This is interesting.

216
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:54,611
Speaker 1: When the Gameboy color turned on you could hold down different button combinations while it was booting to choose from amongst the Super Gameboy color Palette, but it did not add the borders Around it right the end.

217
00:13:54,691 --> 00:14:12,860
Speaker 1: this Gameboy player for the Gamecube also didn't recognize the the Super Gameboy enhanced borders, right, but the Emulators that you can get for the you know, many Gameboy emulators do recognize those borders and display them properly.

218
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:30,260
Speaker 1: So it's kind of interesting like the only Nintendo product ever to recognize the Super Gameboy Enhanced Gameboy games was the Super Gameboy even though their their future products did not recognize, you know Like if you play it on a Gameboy SP some old Gameboy game that had you know The Super Gameboy enhancements you won't see those enhancements on there.

219
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:37,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess part of it was that most of the games I had in the Gameboy were not the kind of game You'd want to sit in front of a TV and play.

220
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:39,688
Speaker 1: Yeah the only Gameboy game that you really whatever.

221
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:47,000
Speaker 1: there's only a few that like were TV sit up like maybe Zelda and Maybe the Donkey Kong and that's not Gameboy Wars.

222
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:48,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you didn't have that shit.

223
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,889
Speaker 0: I had crystal warriors on my Gamegear.

224
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:52,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

225
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:53,254
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

226
00:14:53,314 --> 00:15:04,078
Speaker 0: I was I think the thing I was most Obsessed with throughout my entire childhood was hooking multiple Gameboys or Gamegears up to play a game Because none of my friends were interested in that.

227
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:05,503
Speaker 1: No, he had.

228
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:06,667
Speaker 1: people are interested in it.

229
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:09,579
Speaker 1: It's like you couldn't make it happen because you know one.

230
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,331
Speaker 0: I didn't know anyone else in the world who had a Gamegear.

231
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:14,160
Speaker 0: So there's no way I was ever gonna link that up.

232
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,740
Speaker 1: I never saw a Gamegear linkage, but I saw Gameboy linkage when we had Pokemon.

233
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:30,840
Speaker 1: There was a lot of Gameboy linkage going on with Pokemon like red and blue And also I remember on a field trip in elementary schools There were four kids who hooked up their game regular Gameboys to play f1 with the four-way.

234
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:39,280
Speaker 1: Yeah but other than that it was pretty rare because Pretty much the only way you could do it right is if there was a rich kid or a spoiled kid.

235
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,465
Speaker 1: then he would have.

236
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:47,695
Speaker 1: they get a Gameboy the necessary games and All the wires, but you needed to get lucky and have three other.

237
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,080
Speaker 1: they wouldn't have more than one Gameboy.

238
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:56,659
Speaker 1: So you need to have three other kids with Gameboys Who also had the game in the same place at the same time and that's pretty rare.

239
00:15:57,644 --> 00:15:58,509
Speaker 1: It was one of those things.

240
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:11,138
Speaker 1: like the only people who were together enough you know in groups enough of gamers to make it happen on a regular basis were Nerds and kids and neither of them really had the money to buy all that stuff.

241
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,070
Speaker 1: Take a unique circumstance.

242
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,800
Speaker 1: It's like, you know your story about swords.

243
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,552
Speaker 1: You never had the desire for swords and the money for swords at the same time.

244
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:25,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, thankfully, but here's a thing That's actually a good thing not a waste like swords unless you're a sword person.

245
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:39,127
Speaker 0: Yeah At the same time the mystery you need but you need a combination to make it happen crystal warriors Which is kind of an advanced wars style like tactical fantasy grid based fighting game with magic and whatever Had multiplayer mode that I never saw.

246
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:45,888
Speaker 0: and because there was no good Sega equivalent of Nintendo power I couldn't live that vicariously.

247
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:51,427
Speaker 0: by reading Nintendo power could read game pro game pro didn't talk about GM didn't talk about crystal warriors.

248
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:58,537
Speaker 0: So I had like I saw a picture of One shot from the multiplayer game.

249
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,640
Speaker 0: to this day I don't know how it works because no one cares about fucking crystal warrior.

250
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,926
Speaker 1: That actually is something.

251
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:14,228
Speaker 1: right is if you go on say any website Gaming website say game spot right now game stop game spot Right and you look up like, you know Go through the list of new releases and you'll see.

252
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,094
Speaker 1: it'll show you every game that's gonna be released.

253
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:20,089
Speaker 1: and the hot games the big Games, right the ones that people know about.

254
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,099
Speaker 1: I'll have scores next to them and reviews.

255
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:25,654
Speaker 1: But all the other games all the shovelware doesn't have a review or anything.

256
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,140
Speaker 1: It's just like they have a bear information.

257
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,844
Speaker 0: Oh shit, son.

258
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:31,060
Speaker 0: Here's some video playthroughs of single-player only, right?

259
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:39,980
Speaker 1: But if you go if someone were to make a site that actually Seriously reviewed all the games that every other site ignored you could probably get a lot of traffic.

260
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:48,899
Speaker 1: Cuz pretty much anyone who searches for any of those, you know sub You know under-the-radar games is gonna end up at your site first as the number one result.

261
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:54,713
Speaker 1: And on top of that, you know It's there's so many of those games that you would be able to.

262
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:59,297
Speaker 1: you'd have to create a lot of content But you would get a lot of hits because it adds up in that long tail.

263
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,170
Speaker 1: true Especially on the sit like the portable systems.

264
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,817
Speaker 1: the vast majority like 80% of the games.

265
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:09,095
Speaker 0: Well, we really need to get rid of is the stupid game facts text-only culture.

266
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:12,889
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, absolutely I'm so sick at game facts.

267
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,260
Speaker 1: and what the YouTube is much better for that.

268
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,599
Speaker 0: The fact that game facts even has a forum kind of amazes me.

269
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you want like some actual news that people care about I know you don't like the Call of Duty games.

270
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,184
Speaker 1: Not a fan of the duties

271
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:32,580
Speaker 0: duties duty Scott doesn't like duty especially the third one which is now yet but

272
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:34,103
Speaker 1: Many

273
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:46,219
Speaker 0: people have been commenting on the fact and apparently there was a press Blackout as in there are people in the press who know who aren't allowed to report on the details yet Which we've talked about that before and the BS around that.

274
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:52,145
Speaker 0: But there was an article and I think the New York Times and that a bunch of people were saying Yeah that are the Wall Street Journal.

275
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:57,586
Speaker 0: and then other people were saying that article wasn't actually accurate and I don't know the truth.

276
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:02,120
Speaker 0: I dug around enough and I found equal conflicting evidence for multiple versions.

277
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,048
Speaker 0: What Activision is doing with Call of Duty?

278
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:19,920
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm the gist of it is and this is legit Activision is going to charge money a monthly fee Probably between four and eight dollars a month Which to quote them is comparable to something like Netflix.

279
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:26,818
Speaker 0: I mean if you'll play eight bucks a month for Netflix Then why wouldn't you pay four or five six bucks a month for Call of Duty's?

280
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,040
Speaker 1: Every Call of Duty or just the one Call of Duty?

281
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,225
Speaker 0: Oh, so Call of Duty?

282
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,752
Speaker 1: which Call of Duty they talking about?

283
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,419
Speaker 1: new like 20 of them, which is the new one?

284
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,510
Speaker 1: I guess the most popular one all of duty modern warfare 3.

285
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,276
Speaker 0: I just not out yet.

286
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,420
Speaker 1: All right, does that count?

287
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,145
Speaker 1: Is that on X?

288
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:43,478
Speaker 1: is this your Xbox or just PC?

289
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,083
Speaker 0: Multiple things.

290
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:48,275
Speaker 1: so you'd have to pay it even on top of your Xbox Live Gold.

291
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:49,660
Speaker 0: Uh, yes, but here's the thing.

292
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:58,004
Speaker 0: At first people reported that yeah, you can play just fine single-player But if you want to play multiplayer You gotta pay.

293
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:03,020
Speaker 0: and then that statement got retracted and replaced by a whole bunch of other things.

294
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Speaker 0: So it's possible that they were testing the waters to see how people would react with like the incrementally less offensive options.

295
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:13,592
Speaker 0: But you're gonna be able to pay a monthly fee to be a member.

296
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:13,994
Speaker 0: Let's do

297
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:14,917
Speaker 1: a fucking survey

298
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:33,280
Speaker 0: Call of Duty Modern warfare 3 or modern warfare Elites and they won't say what this will entail other than that It will involve a social network that's directly like integrated into the game And maybe stat tracking like, you know, let's put it this way counter-strike.

299
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,481
Speaker 0: We play counter-strike right now say a new counter-strike came out like that tactical insertion game or counter-strike 3.

300
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:48,715
Speaker 0: Yes counter-strike 3 on the source 3 engine is coming out next month and they said alright The game itself is say I don't know 40 bucks forever.

301
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:49,940
Speaker 0: You just buy it and you have it.

302
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
Speaker 1: That's already kind of bullshit cuz I'm used to counter-strike being free.

303
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,467
Speaker 0: Alright, well say alright fine.

304
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:54,970
Speaker 0: Say it's free.

305
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,096
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike is a free mod.

306
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:56,960
Speaker 1: It's not I don't consider.

307
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,370
Speaker 1: You know, it was always a mod.

308
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,705
Speaker 1: I don't consider it to be a game You should have to pay for.

309
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:01,248
Speaker 0: but why?

310
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:04,794
Speaker 0: what if someone really I mean they made a new game from scratch That was just counter-strike better.

311
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:08,355
Speaker 1: Well, okay There's that there's one of the guys who originally made counter-strike.

312
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,240
Speaker 1: is sort of doing that.

313
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,680
Speaker 1: Let's forget what his game is called but pretend it's that game.

314
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:11,959
Speaker 0: Okay.

315
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:20,419
Speaker 0: So say there were a month like of something that could be in the game But could only be in the game if they charged a monthly fee for it.

316
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:27,220
Speaker 0: Can you think of anything they could put into a game like this that you would pay a monthly permanent fee for to have access?

317
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,780
Speaker 0: To uh, I mean social network with clans and stuff built in.

318
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,823
Speaker 0: It's called to.

319
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:36,936
Speaker 0: did that by out of the box, but it's called steam and Xbox live.

320
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,140
Speaker 1: just integrate with that shit.

321
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,263
Speaker 1: Don't make your own shit.

322
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,246
Speaker 1: It's like everyone.

323
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:41,450
Speaker 1: everyone's fucking up.

324
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,940
Speaker 0: Nobody wants Scott Scott, then they can't charge you money for it.

325
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,553
Speaker 1: No kidding, but nobody wants your fucking separate bullshit.

326
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:48,740
Speaker 1: They're not gonna pay money for it.

327
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,212
Speaker 1: They want steam or and or Xbox live.

328
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:52,619
Speaker 1: Nobody wants anything else.

329
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:56,835
Speaker 1: All your any everything else other than those two things that has tried to do.

330
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,140
Speaker 1: this is fail.

331
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:00,820
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess the blow battle that battle net also is good.

332
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,929
Speaker 1: Those are the three successes.

333
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,460
Speaker 1: everything else that has tried to do that is fail.

334
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,633
Speaker 0: I would argue the tribes to stuff works just fine, but there was fail.

335
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,636
Speaker 0: What was fail about it.

336
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:11,980
Speaker 1: It really didn't work.

337
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:17,305
Speaker 0: Well, the fact that it didn't actually work was the only Surprise.

338
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,858
Speaker 0: had it worked it would have been okay.

339
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:23,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, because steam Xbox live and battle battle that existed but steam and Xbox live did not.

340
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:27,800
Speaker 0: but people are saying that one thing they might Offer is matte packs.

341
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:32,865
Speaker 0: But then the question is alright If you stop paying the monthly fee Do you lose access to the maps?

342
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:36,058
Speaker 0: if you don't pay like can you only play those maps with people who pay?

343
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,460
Speaker 0: so no one?

344
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,105
Speaker 0: Knows how that'll work.

345
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:38,496
Speaker 1: What if I just make my own map?

346
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:40,365
Speaker 1: Can I Everybody for free.

347
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:44,399
Speaker 0: Well, if they don't pay console games that making your own maps usually doesn't work.

348
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:46,492
Speaker 1: that well Yeah, but this is also a PC game.

349
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:46,814
Speaker 0: Yeah.

350
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:48,524
Speaker 0: All right How about?

351
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,087
Speaker 0: maybe they get?

352
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,759
Speaker 0: let you run dedicated servers like you can already do for free on the PC.

353
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,803
Speaker 1: That should be free.

354
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:57,180
Speaker 0: Maybe people are saying they're gonna add detailed stat tracking.

355
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,679
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean like Counter-Strike does for free?

356
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,893
Speaker 1: Well me and any other people do for free with their third-party add-ons cuz it's open.

357
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:09,756
Speaker 0: I guess I can't imagine Anything they could offer that anyone would pay for.

358
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,262
Speaker 0: now I won't know.

359
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:19,159
Speaker 1: cuz like we were just talking about running our own counter-strike server and paying someone to run that server for us But that one alright, so one guy pays to run a server.

360
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:22,420
Speaker 0: Do the people who want to play on that custom server also have to pay?

361
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:34,746
Speaker 1: No, but what they could do right is this is actually wouldn't be a bad move is They could be you know, instead like the companies that are hosting that game servers calm Whatever that are offering counter-strike hosting.

362
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:40,160
Speaker 1: Why doesn't valve offer counter-strike server hosting directly so I could just go in steam?

363
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:40,867
Speaker 1: I would be.

364
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,140
Speaker 1: that would be so much more trustworthy.

365
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:48,486
Speaker 1: I'd be so much more willing to do it to then go into this shady company and just click and it's like you have bought A counter-strike server.

366
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,075
Speaker 1: Here's an easy GUI to configure it.

367
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:53,792
Speaker 1: It's totally standard You know, it's reliable because the people who make the game are running it.

368
00:23:54,294 --> 00:24:04,165
Speaker 1: you have full control over it, though I'd pay for that Right, and then it would be really easy since integrating with the steam account to like turn it on and turn it off and charge By the hour, you know.

369
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:06,635
Speaker 1: some really low rate, you know, but 75 cents a slot a month.

370
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:14,442
Speaker 1: Well, just divide that by 30 and make it you know, two cents a slot a day or something like that You know.

371
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:18,120
Speaker 1: or one cent a slot for 12 hours, you know.

372
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,657
Speaker 1: So that way I could turn it on and off when I'm playing when I'm not playing you won't have to.

373
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:30,038
Speaker 1: but and the thing Is that'll solve a lot of your problems where you know, people can't get their firewalls working Yeah, or all this other bullshit.

374
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:35,360
Speaker 1: now At least you can also help you cheat that with cheat prevention because you're the only one run.

375
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,580
Speaker 1: Most of the servers will be run by the company, you know.

376
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,000
Speaker 1: So they'll have all this data from the servers to stop cheating.

377
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,043
Speaker 0: Yes, now many of the rumors before this news was kind of half-broken talked about how oh you have to pay to even play online.

378
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:50,819
Speaker 0: but they came out and basically said that's not true.

379
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:59,556
Speaker 0: and They definitely said that if you have Xbox Gold Xbox Live Gold You still have to pay for this on top of that to get access to the special features.

380
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:00,620
Speaker 1: That's a hundred bullshits.

381
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:05,741
Speaker 1: Yep, if you're paying for Xbox Live Gold, that means you should get all the stuff I mean now.

382
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:09,634
Speaker 1: why don't they just make it DLCs like look Street Fighter 4, right?

383
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:11,420
Speaker 1: They're coming they're doing it.

384
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,983
Speaker 1: Actually, I think I consider the right way or mostly the right way, you know considering the fact they do have business interests Right.

385
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:18,640
Speaker 1: So Street Fighter 4 arcade mode.

386
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:27,246
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's out yet or it's coming very soon but the way it works is basically if Super Street Fighter 4 you want to add arcade mode basically gets you new characters and It gives you balanced.

387
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:29,700
Speaker 1: It changes the balance of the game and some other stuff, right?

388
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,291
Speaker 1: You have to pay for it.

389
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:31,879
Speaker 1: It's a DLC.

390
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,263
Speaker 1: It's a one-time cost.

391
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:40,120
Speaker 1: if you don't pay for it people who have paid for it can still fight against you in the old mode.

392
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:44,020
Speaker 1: So it's like this is backwards compatibility mode where you can still play with those people.

393
00:25:44,362 --> 00:25:46,600
Speaker 1: You just don't have access to the new mode.

394
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,176
Speaker 1: It's totally a DLC, but it doesn't limit your online options really at all.

395
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:52,320
Speaker 0: Not a bad way to go about it.

396
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:56,460
Speaker 1: It's like they didn't dick over the people who refuse to pay and still want to play the old way.

397
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:06,073
Speaker 1: They just give you know an added bonus of the people who do pay for the arcade mode and it's a one-time DLC thing but it's not one of those DLCs like where they have.

398
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,220
Speaker 1: some of their DLCs are bullshit like pay for costumes.

399
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:09,767
Speaker 1: It's a real DLC.

400
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:12,239
Speaker 1: It gives you characters and you know stuff like that.

401
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:17,319
Speaker 1: So, you know if I played if I started playing Street Fighter again, I would probably pay for it.

402
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:20,710
Speaker 0: What really worries me is that here's a quote from one of the articles.

403
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:31,882
Speaker 0: another feature of the service will give Call of Duty players tools modeled on those from stock trading websites to analyze their performance within the game Mm-hmm.

404
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,538
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what they mean by tools from stock trading websites.

405
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:38,520
Speaker 1: in other words It'll show you graphs of your stuff over time.

406
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,306
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean like counter-strike already does.

407
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:45,263
Speaker 0: I can see how often I hit with every individual gun that I've ever used since they Rolled this out.

408
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,931
Speaker 0: Yep already just free.

409
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:47,353
Speaker 1: Yep.

410
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:48,920
Speaker 0: So we'll see what happens.

411
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:56,779
Speaker 0: I think the goal here is not so much to make money immediately but to get people used to the idea of paying monthly fees for games.

412
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:01,009
Speaker 0: because Rob Dyer said where's the quote about?

413
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,924
Speaker 0: he's very confident that other publishers will follow Activision's lead Quote.

414
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:08,033
Speaker 0: there's money to be made there.

415
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:19,140
Speaker 1: I think there's just a problem I'm seeing in all in pretty much all nerd industries across the board, right whether it's you know gaming or tabletop gaming or comics or anime.

416
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:22,211
Speaker 1: Right, all these people basically are.

417
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,700
Speaker 1: I consider the companies to be lazy, right?

418
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,320
Speaker 1: All they try to do is they say look we've sold a zillion copies of Call of Duty.

419
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:37,680
Speaker 1: Instead of trying to sell even more copies of Call of Duty Let's just try to get everyone's just trying to get more money out of the people they're already selling to right.

420
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,560
Speaker 1: Nintendo is the only one who didn't do that and now everyone hates them.

421
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,500
Speaker 1: But what they did is they said, oh, let's just try to sell them more people.

422
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:45,210
Speaker 0: Well, see it's got.

423
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:48,546
Speaker 0: here's the thing though You forget that I mean Call of Duty as a franchise.

424
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:53,498
Speaker 0: right now is the fourth and fifth most popular FPS on Steam.

425
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,580
Speaker 0: Oh Number one is still counter-strike - is also counter-strike.

426
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,804
Speaker 0: That's too bad.

427
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,711
Speaker 0: three is Team Fortress 2 and Left 4.

428
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:01,494
Speaker 0: Dead 2 is right.

429
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:05,990
Speaker 1: under both Call of Duty's Yeah, but it's like you don't see.

430
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:10,208
Speaker 1: valve has all those games Right to get and they're not charging shit.

431
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:16,108
Speaker 0: all the Call of Duty players online combined on Steam with PCs Which obviously is a skewed statistic.

432
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:19,900
Speaker 0: Don't get me wrong doesn't even add up to the number of counter-strike one six players?

433
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:23,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least right now as of six.

434
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:24,960
Speaker 0: fifty nine Eastern Daylight Time.

435
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:27,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they got a lot to learn there.

436
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:35,186
Speaker 1: Maybe they should try to get as many players as counter-strike before they start trying, you know The thing is if you look at this is only gonna decrease the number of players I've got.

437
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:40,635
Speaker 0: if you look at consoles I mean how many people are playing counter-strike on their Xbox or their ps3?

438
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,180
Speaker 1: It was only on the Xbox one.

439
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,806
Speaker 1: I don't know.

440
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:45,442
Speaker 1: I don't think counter-strike was on the Xbox 60.

441
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:53,164
Speaker 0: so and if you pretend PC gaming doesn't exist which for the majority of gamers it effectively doesn't I Think it.

442
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,600
Speaker 1: I think actually PC gaming has made a huge come back.

443
00:28:55,783 --> 00:28:58,264
Speaker 0: It has a huge comeback But I still think the majority.

444
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:12,667
Speaker 0: if you look at like a cross-section of video gamers as a whole people who self identify as video gamers I would guess that the majority do not have a dedicated gaming PC or Even play anything other than flash games on their PC.

445
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:17,040
Speaker 1: I think this will play Minecraft and I just think there's a surprising minority.

446
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,220
Speaker 0: You forget how many people have Xbox Live and play Call of Duty?

447
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:25,379
Speaker 0: We got of course, let's look all this up, of course, no one's playing Call of Duty on the PlayStation right now.

448
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:27,245
Speaker 1: I think that's fixed though.

449
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,369
Speaker 1: I don't from what I heard.

450
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:31,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not sure though because I haven't exactly cared to pay attention.

451
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:32,919
Speaker 0: We'll see where all this goes.

452
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,160
Speaker 0: We'll probably do a follow-up or maybe an episode on this kind of thing.

453
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,504
Speaker 1: So I can understand paying the monthly fee for the MMO like MMO Like.

454
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:50,538
Speaker 1: I don't like the game obviously but if I liked an MMO the Computer architecture of it pretty much demands that they have some huge centralized servers that are expensive.

455
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:54,580
Speaker 0: or for example What if you paid a monthly fee for a Final Fantasy 6 style game?

456
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:03,979
Speaker 0: Where you're paying a monthly fee and everyone else is playing a monthly fee and it's a pseudo art MMO Where there's just constant content being added all the time?

457
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:05,858
Speaker 1: Well, that's basically like it.

458
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:10,055
Speaker 1: That's the same thing as if there was a DLC every month and you paid.

459
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:12,665
Speaker 1: you bought a DLC every month But instead it's continuous.

460
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:13,989
Speaker 0: It's almost like an MMO.

461
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:17,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they release they trickle the the the DLC instead of putting it in a blob.

462
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:24,040
Speaker 0: The subscription model is only really used now for MMOs as the industry defines MMO.

463
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,248
Speaker 0: I think we did a whole panel.

464
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:26,900
Speaker 0: We talked about how that's a stupid definition.

465
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I think there are.

466
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:33,240
Speaker 0: I guess my point is there are games that really would warrant a subscription model.

467
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,831
Speaker 0: I just don't think that almost anyone in the gaming industry is making those games.

468
00:30:37,513 --> 00:30:39,519
Speaker 1: Well, you know the thing is number one.

469
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:48,009
Speaker 1: They could if they wanted to write somebody could try really hard to make an MMO style game That does not have the centralized architecture.

470
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:56,139
Speaker 1: There's some sort of peer-to-peer architecture or something along those lines that was pretty advanced and then they could avoid having to charge the monthly fee, right?

471
00:30:56,199 --> 00:31:09,188
Speaker 1: or Likewise someone can take a non MMO style game But figure out ways to improve it vastly by basing it on that centralized architecture and thus Validating the monthly fee.

472
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:16,480
Speaker 1: like imagine if there was some sort of Zelda game and there was a new dungeon every goddamn day, right?

473
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,572
Speaker 0: Maybe not every day everyone there'd be more dungeons than I could be.

474
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,600
Speaker 0: that's the point kind of like that stat recently.

475
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,776
Speaker 0: I think it's something like 48 hours of video or uploaded to YouTube every hour.

476
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:34,880
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean the point, you know, it's like, you know If a game was just constantly growing or if there was like if there was you know, one minecraft world for everybody.

477
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:39,039
Speaker 0: You pay a monthly fee for that shit, I would probably pay a monthly fee for that.

478
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:41,392
Speaker 1: There's just one minecraft world dicks everywhere.

479
00:31:41,412 --> 00:31:43,020
Speaker 1: Hey, just the gigantic.

480
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,460
Speaker 1: It'd be as big as like half the universe.

481
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:54,339
Speaker 1: Oh, that would be interesting if you added up all the minecraft worlds into one world and then Translated them to real size like based on the size of a real sheep.

482
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:56,426
Speaker 1: Right, how big?

483
00:31:56,587 --> 00:31:59,295
Speaker 1: how much space in real space would it take up?

484
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:00,660
Speaker 1: It obviously probably bigger than earth.

485
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:14,500
Speaker 0: I remember I don't remember the stat anymore but when I was first getting into doom modding back in the day, you know, I used wadded and we didn't do and all that and D hacked to like mod doom and I made a bunch of cool stuff and a bunch of really amateurish maps.

486
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:18,880
Speaker 0: That didn't work so well in multiplayer because my cool concepts did not translate into games.

487
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:29,116
Speaker 0: But I remember when somewhat like just part of the dev manuals I had talked about how big the world is in terms in real terms relative to the perspective of the player.

488
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:47,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Yeah, I don't really have anything to go with that other than that I saw a pretty scary my little pony fan thing someone did where they basically made a pinkie pie or Twilight Sparkle who was as big as a continent and I am under no illusions that that person did not make that by hand in Minecraft.

489
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:49,131
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty sure they just made an editor.

490
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,258
Speaker 0: I don't know.

491
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:51,449
Speaker 0: Look at the people.

492
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,500
Speaker 0: look at what our forums doing.

493
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,077
Speaker 0: They I think enough people are enough crazy to make an entire continent size Twilight Sparkle.

494
00:32:58,258 --> 00:32:58,820
Speaker 0: good job.

495
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,789
Speaker 0: So things of the day what do you got for me?

496
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,507
Speaker 1: So check this out.

497
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:12,396
Speaker 1: This is nothing to do with gaming.

498
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,019
Speaker 1: Nothing.

499
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,606
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of kinetic sculptures.

500
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,370
Speaker 1: They're pretty cool.

501
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:19,506
Speaker 0: I like ones where you can move something large in public.

502
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:24,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are good But this is one where you don't actually move anything But it is in public.

503
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:25,343
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's.

504
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:26,370
Speaker 1: I think it's in a museum.

505
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:34,005
Speaker 1: It's at the truck gallery in Calgary, Alberta, right From June 3rd to the 30th, huh?

506
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,077
Speaker 1: And basically what it is is it's.

507
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:50,270
Speaker 1: it's a whole bunch of big long sticks right and they're all hooked up to cams that are all oriented differently and The sticks wave back and forth and it takes about 14 minutes for the pattern of waving back and forth to repeat itself.

508
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:52,853
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, it's a totally different you know thing.

509
00:33:52,873 --> 00:34:04,407
Speaker 1: it like you couldn't tell that it was repeating right a cycle and What it does is it sort of simulates grass Blowing in the wind right like big tall grasses and actually looks like tall grass is blowing in the wind.

510
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:12,213
Speaker 1: other Pokemon in there there might be But the point is it's sort of like hey, you know if there's ever a time when you know It's sort of like.

511
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:15,130
Speaker 1: it's called preserving the wind machine for preserving the wind.

512
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:22,047
Speaker 1: So it's like if there's a you know If there's no tall grasses or no winds or no both ever at a point in the future.

513
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:29,590
Speaker 1: It's sort of like hey, you know Get the idea it's like hey this thing simulates the feeling of looking at the tall grass is blowing in the wind.

514
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:30,634
Speaker 1: It's pretty impressive.

515
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,281
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could talk a lot about preserve.

516
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,270
Speaker 0: I mean even you don't want to relate this to video games.

517
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:38,010
Speaker 0: We're already losing certain kinds of gaming experience.

518
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,559
Speaker 1: We've already lost lots of video games and we're losing more.

519
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,690
Speaker 1: not just but there's people in who are studying like they're only you know.

520
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,790
Speaker 1: They're basically working at colleges working hard to preserve games.

521
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:55,969
Speaker 0: I mean It's one thing like to emulate a game like it's a physical game like an electro mechanical game as it would be played if it Was in perfect working condition.

522
00:34:56,493 --> 00:35:04,170
Speaker 0: but also I think there's value in emulating and Understanding the broken-down condition the condition that games actually were in for the majority of people who play them.

523
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:05,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of like how.

524
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:13,426
Speaker 0: and if you had a video gaming museum There would have to be a Nintendo where the games would glitch out and you'd have to blow in them.

525
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:17,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly I imagine this far future where kids go to the science museum.

526
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:23,790
Speaker 0: You know They have all the shit out and you like poke at it like you at every station and move whatever thing they let you move And then they all get broken immediately.

527
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:28,446
Speaker 0: One of them will be an NES and an NES cartridge on a stick and it tells you to blow into it.

528
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:31,753
Speaker 1: Yeah Man, that could be.

529
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:32,636
Speaker 1: that's in a museum.

530
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:36,950
Speaker 1: But that's our childhoods in a museum next to the ancient Roman artifacts.

531
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:37,927
Speaker 1: Hey like that.

532
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:40,637
Speaker 1: And we're not even 30 yet.

533
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:46,377
Speaker 0: So this doesn't fit in the Continuity of the portal story, but it's cool.

534
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:46,858
Speaker 0: Nonetheless.

535
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:54,568
Speaker 0: Some people made a movie a short little film about Shell from portal and it kind of takes place after the events of portal.

536
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:58,606
Speaker 0: one Obviously not following on the events of portal to wait.

537
00:35:58,847 --> 00:35:59,169
Speaker 1: So wait.

538
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:00,397
Speaker 1: So this is old.

539
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:06,569
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's old or if they just started a long time ago and finished it too late.

540
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:10,244
Speaker 0: But it's cute and cool and very well shot.

541
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:15,668
Speaker 0: and about halfway through She uses portals and they actually look pretty good the way they render them.

542
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,237
Speaker 0: Mmm It's just a cute movie and I think everyone should watch it.

543
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,646
Speaker 0: No, it's not on College Humor.

544
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:29,270
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, so briefly in the meta moment the geek nights book club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

545
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:30,318
Speaker 1: Well, we'll do that pretty soon.

546
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:31,890
Speaker 0: I think yeah, I got a burn through it.

547
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,519
Speaker 0: I kind of got distracted by all these game theory.

548
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:35,389
Speaker 1: I was also distracted by a lot of things.

549
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:36,996
Speaker 1: Let's do it in a few Thursday.

550
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:37,438
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

551
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:40,370
Speaker 0: if you think how far are you in the rereading of the Prince of nothing?

552
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,469
Speaker 1: I actually paused that also because I was distracted by Counter-Strike.

553
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:50,739
Speaker 0: my Yep join the forum, you know all that stuff.

554
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:51,662
Speaker 0: our forums rockin.

555
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:52,545
Speaker 1: Yep.

556
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:53,950
Speaker 0: Check out the documentary.

557
00:36:54,091 --> 00:37:00,015
Speaker 0: I'll just mention this because there's gonna be a screening of it at PAX, which is not that far away But going cardboard.

558
00:37:00,336 --> 00:37:03,870
Speaker 0: we're in that and other cool people are in that as being made by a cool person.

559
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:05,309
Speaker 1: Everyone in it is cooler than us.

560
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:07,562
Speaker 0: It's about yeah, maybe 20% or so

561
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:08,952
Speaker 1: Yeah,

562
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:20,354
Speaker 0: and it's made by a cool person and I don't know what else I can say about it right now But there will be a Q&A and a screening of it at PAX Prime and we will very likely be at the Q&A to answer Questions.

563
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:22,250
Speaker 0: Yeah will be interesting.

564
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:25,083
Speaker 1: Saturday June 18th is nerd NYC recess.

565
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:33,830
Speaker 1: I may or may not be there But if you want to play tabletop games all day It's like 20 bucks and if you run a game in one of the two slots, then you can play the other slot for free.

566
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:36,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's pretty cool.

567
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:41,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm kind of leaning back on the nerd NYC's lately.

568
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:45,530
Speaker 1: You know, I mean not board game night now by recess though, even board game night.

569
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,289
Speaker 0: I do have the trouble and maybe I feel like this could turn into a show that I think we've.

570
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,820
Speaker 0: Let's do a show on it then a show how we've hardcore ourselves into a corner.

571
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:53,763
Speaker 1: Yeah.

572
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:54,265
Speaker 1: Yeah.

573
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,348
Speaker 0: I think we've done that.

574
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:58,970
Speaker 0: Okay There's not that much else matter will be a pax prime.

575
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,449
Speaker 0: We will very likely be a pax dev.

576
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:10,408
Speaker 0: The New York comic-con is far off in the future and I can't say anything definite But there is a decent chance there will be gaming content that many of you who might not otherwise go to New York.

577
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:13,693
Speaker 0: comic cons in New York Might care about.

578
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:14,917
Speaker 1: and also Connecticut.

579
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:15,258
Speaker 0: Yes.

580
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:18,707
Speaker 0: Also Connecticut's upcoming and I'll leave it at that though.

581
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:19,690
Speaker 0: We have one last thing.

582
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,815
Speaker 0: We usually don't beg for money.

583
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:24,310
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna beg for money for someone else a good friend of ours Phil.

584
00:38:24,692 --> 00:38:28,610
Speaker 0: He's the cool parkour guy who gave parkour lessons at Connecticut last year.

585
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:30,976
Speaker 0: So many of you might have actually seen him around.

586
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:36,210
Speaker 0: and he does this crazy-ass bike ride and they raise that crazy.

587
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:37,553
Speaker 0: It's pretty crazy.

588
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:39,459
Speaker 1: Could you do it if I wanted to?

589
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:39,840
Speaker 0: good?

590
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:45,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you wanted to like you should do it That now it then we would need to raise even more monies.

591
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,800
Speaker 1: Cuz I asked him like how do you you know, he's like you.

592
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,563
Speaker 1: basically you need to.

593
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:53,643
Speaker 1: you need to give like hundreds of your Own money and they need to raise like thousands from donations.

594
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,429
Speaker 1: So it's a lot of money to get into it.

595
00:38:56,312 --> 00:38:56,834
Speaker 0: But we have.

596
00:38:56,995 --> 00:38:57,677
Speaker 0: we have listeners.

597
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,110
Speaker 0: I guess it's too late because we're gonna direct all of your charity to them.

598
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,278
Speaker 0: So it's not Child's Play season.

599
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,409
Speaker 1: So if you have money, it is always Child's Play season.

600
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:09,984
Speaker 0: actually Yeah, but it's not like the big Child's Play season where everyone's going.

601
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:11,108
Speaker 0: Oh shit Child's Play.

602
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:11,390
Speaker 1: That's true.

603
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:22,343
Speaker 0: So if you don't want to immediately donate money to Child's Play I will humbly recommend that you donate a small amount of money to Team easy riders because it's for Lou Gehrig's disease, which actually kind of sucks.

604
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:23,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't want that.

605
00:39:23,587 --> 00:39:24,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Lou Gehrig.

606
00:39:26,593 --> 00:39:27,341
Speaker 1: He didn't want that either.

607
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:28,110
Speaker 0: No, he really didn't.

608
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:35,343
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you so if you know They basically need to raise this money to be able to do the bike ride in the first place.

609
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:44,504
Speaker 0: So, you know Yep, friend of ours cool guy and it if people do donate to him Maybe we'll get him on the show to talk about parkour or something.

610
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:45,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got a lot to talk about.

611
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's doing something really cool.

612
00:39:47,478 --> 00:39:48,905
Speaker 0: Maybe he's walking around the world.

613
00:39:48,945 --> 00:39:49,990
Speaker 0: Well, we'll talk about that later.

614
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:51,670
Speaker 1: We got a lot of friends who are full of awesome.

615
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:55,549
Speaker 1: That's more awesome than us, but they really have a hard time getting them on the show.

616
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:02,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly because we're lazy and we live in New York and people are All the time.

617
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,306
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

618
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:09,080
Speaker 0: So I guess it's time to review some games and we got two games for you Like you might have heard in the beginning there.

619
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,542
Speaker 0: They're both.

620
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:16,512
Speaker 0: they can both be played to player though One of them is obligatory to player and I don't know they're both really good warm-up games Like.

621
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:18,426
Speaker 0: they're the kind of game you play before you play a game.

622
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,917
Speaker 1: Yo dog Yeah, it seems like the thing.

623
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:23,370
Speaker 1: the thing is though lately we've only been playing warm-up games.

624
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,694
Speaker 1: No one wants to play real game.

625
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:28,065
Speaker 0: Well, this goes back into our we hardcore ourselves into a corner.

626
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:32,661
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Guess we're gonna have to do hard quarter ourselves into a corner as a show then.

627
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:44,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is good because we're working on Basically, we decided that since we can't come back from the event horizon we have passed beyond We can't play games with the world born anymore.

628
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:48,390
Speaker 0: So we're gonna lock ourselves in our Cathedral and play games with each other.

629
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:53,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so the first game is called battle line or battle lines.

630
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,010
Speaker 1: It's by Rainer Knizian.

631
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:58,504
Speaker 0: It is a direct simulation of a bunch of Greeks pushing against each other.

632
00:40:58,845 --> 00:40:59,990
Speaker 1: Yeah rim loves that.

633
00:41:00,652 --> 00:41:03,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I first played this game at PAX East.

634
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:12,890
Speaker 1: actually Alex got it from the PAX East game library brought it over we played it once and then he brought it he put it back and then I went to the To the gaming store looking for and I couldn't find it.

635
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,810
Speaker 1: But I went to the gaming store again and it was in a different section and I noticed it cuz rim was standing next to it.

636
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,309
Speaker 1: So I bought it and we played it a whole bunch more.

637
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:26,354
Speaker 1: basically, this is If you've ever played Rainer Knizia's What's it called?

638
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:29,824
Speaker 1: Why did the name of the the game just lost cities?

639
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:31,308
Speaker 0: I think that's the one.

640
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,090
Speaker 1: yeah lost cities.

641
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:38,310
Speaker 1: It's very similar to that right you're playing cards in different columns against the other players cards.

642
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,360
Speaker 1: He's also playing in columns and it's two player only.

643
00:41:40,862 --> 00:42:00,361
Speaker 1: but the way it works is there are nine Columns and you play your Greek troops right that you're drawing from the deck into the different columns and When you have won a column as in the car you have three cards on your side of the column and there is no way Absolutely, no way the cards on the other side of that column can beat you.

644
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:01,745
Speaker 1: you win that column.

645
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:07,755
Speaker 0: now when we say no way It's in the way that you know, if you ever play hearts or Euchre you'll be you know experienced players.

646
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:10,544
Speaker 0: when they're playing with noobs the noobs will often get very confused.

647
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:14,157
Speaker 1: when about halfway through some guy just Opens his hand is like I take the rest.

648
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:20,923
Speaker 0: Yep, or everyone just throws down their cards like that's done Yep, and this game basically puts that into the rules.

649
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:24,014
Speaker 0: you only get something when you can say yes I've got it.

650
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:32,230
Speaker 1: Here's why now there are also So the way then you win if you win five out of nine columns or if you get three adjacent columns.

651
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,641
Speaker 0: So there's this little bit of posturing and fate.

652
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:42,577
Speaker 0: basically if I had to sum this game up It's very similar to a heart style game a trick-taking kind of game Except that one.

653
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:45,089
Speaker 0: it works really well with two player which most games like that don't.

654
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:46,757
Speaker 1: yeah They only need four player and two.

655
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:55,510
Speaker 0: it adds both some randomness Which we haven't talked about yet and some strategy to make a really fun experience even if it isn't the greatest game.

656
00:42:55,651 --> 00:43:06,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, it's actually I think it's one of the best two-player games ever played Absolutely, but there's you know, there's not that you know other than actual war games Which will be you know.

657
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:10,102
Speaker 1: Then again two-player games are all sort of have the same flaws.

658
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:12,250
Speaker 1: that makes them not as good as real good.

659
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:17,870
Speaker 0: The thing is two-player games aren't as flawed as three-player games for skilled players, that's true.

660
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:27,350
Speaker 1: But anyway, the game also has these tactics cards that sort of you know have superpowers But you don't take them into account right unless they're already on the table.

661
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:33,114
Speaker 1: So it's like I could still win this column if I get this special card, but it's like well, that's a special card So it doesn't count.

662
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:33,879
Speaker 1: I win this column.

663
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:34,584
Speaker 1: Right?

664
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:35,550
Speaker 1: So that's that's pretty cool.

665
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:40,108
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean it basically if it were just that if it was just.

666
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:42,117
Speaker 0: you know The cards out and it's basically poker.

667
00:43:42,158 --> 00:43:55,080
Speaker 0: There's six suits and there's numbers in this car And you know, it's like a straight flush is the most powerful Beats three of a kind which beats a flush which beats a straight which beats a high card Like some.

668
00:43:55,221 --> 00:44:03,836
Speaker 1: yeah, so it's like, you know all the basically all the troops have numbers and colors and you know you like if I'm too away from a straight flush even if It's a low straight flush.

669
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:06,025
Speaker 0: and Scott has two cards.

670
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:06,950
Speaker 0: There are different colors.

671
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:16,329
Speaker 0: I can play the third part of my straight flush and I just get it immediately because there's no way any card Scott plays That aren't special could possibly make that column beat me.

672
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:23,190
Speaker 1: Yep, or let's say I've got you know, eight nine ten and they're all green in a column right rim has a seven.

673
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,044
Speaker 1: Well, there's no way that he can possibly win that column because there's no way.

674
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:28,630
Speaker 1: the best he can do would be seven eight.

675
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:37,068
Speaker 0: Actually, I would have won that column anyway, because if you play if you have an eight nine ten out anywhere Because if someone gets there first they win a tie.

676
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:42,024
Speaker 0: There is no way to beat that tunnel a column and you just get it immediately Even if the other person has never played a card there.

677
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:49,779
Speaker 1: There has to be a way for no because I could play It's nothing you could write that would beat it.

678
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:51,690
Speaker 1: eight nine ten is the best possible thing.

679
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,856
Speaker 0: It's only a nine ten.

680
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:55,912
Speaker 0: the other person loses even if you never if they never played a card That's true.

681
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:59,229
Speaker 1: But let's say I play seven eight nine in a column and you have a six.

682
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:06,610
Speaker 1: There's no way that you could possibly do You know anything that would tie or beat seven eight nine because you already have a six in that column.

683
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:07,673
Speaker 1: So I win the column.

684
00:45:07,693 --> 00:45:15,649
Speaker 0: so the game comes down to a lot of posturing and fainting and like I see Scott played a six Seven but I have the eight in my hand.

685
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:17,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I know the only cut.

686
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:19,202
Speaker 0: there's only one card that'll fill that.

687
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:25,609
Speaker 0: so maybe I take a risk and I start building Just a three of a kind there instead or a flush there instead.

688
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:29,087
Speaker 1: But then maybe you know, he's even he's the inside card.

689
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:31,810
Speaker 1: you've got him But maybe he'll go for the low card or the high card.

690
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,050
Speaker 1: You know if he's got seven eight, he might do six seven eight or seven eight nine.

691
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:36,039
Speaker 1: You don't know which way he'll go.

692
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,229
Speaker 0: now the game crooks slightly.

693
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:39,186
Speaker 0: So in that there's two decks to draw from.

694
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:42,604
Speaker 0: yeah And this is this is kind of like the twist in the game that makes it.

695
00:45:42,946 --> 00:45:47,590
Speaker 0: if it didn't have this twist It really would just be about the same level of strategy as a game like hearts.

696
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:52,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the special deck as all the special power cards in it and the regular deck is all the regular cards.

697
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,684
Speaker 1: So it's not like you get the special cards randomly.

698
00:45:54,986 --> 00:46:00,090
Speaker 1: if you choose Are you gonna draw a regular card or a special one and you'll never have more cards in your hand?

699
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:00,792
Speaker 0: Really?

700
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:03,910
Speaker 1: You always have exactly seven in your hand period done.

701
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,661
Speaker 1: You cannot get more or less and you can.

702
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:15,750
Speaker 0: and there's a neat mechanic where if you play a special card You can basically never play More than n plus one special cards and being the number of special cards your opponent has played.

703
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:19,630
Speaker 1: So if rim has already played one special card, he can't play anymore.

704
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,614
Speaker 1: So he draws more.

705
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:24,790
Speaker 1: this basically fill up his hand and reduce his number of options because he can't play them.

706
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:32,889
Speaker 1: So there's really only if he's got three special cards in his hand one on the table and I have zero on the table He really only has four options for the turn instead of seven.

707
00:46:33,693 --> 00:46:38,112
Speaker 1: Then as soon as I play a special card now he can play one again And you know.

708
00:46:38,153 --> 00:46:54,890
Speaker 1: so as long you can only you there's no way to like say pile up the special cards and just play them all to destroy the other guy because that would be sort of pointless because everyone would grab all the special cards immediately be forced to Play them all really quickly and then the game would continue because they are much more powerful than the regular cards.

709
00:46:56,311 --> 00:47:05,339
Speaker 1: So that that mechanic of not allowing you to play more special cards than your opponent or at least too many more than your opponent Really keeps the balance going.

710
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:07,205
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it would be kind of stupid.

711
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:13,806
Speaker 0: now the strategy is pretty good I mean if you ignore the special cards for a minute because remember they don't count in terms of Logically winning a column.

712
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:22,033
Speaker 0: so you can be in a situation where you know The other person can't win a column because you have the last card in your straight.

713
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:24,140
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm in your hand ready to go anytime.

714
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:31,460
Speaker 0: But if the other person play you could be in a situation where maybe that card that'll win the straight is a special card.

715
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:38,720
Speaker 0: Then if the other player makes something else and he is guaranteed to win Except for your special card you lose it.

716
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,500
Speaker 0: So you're kind of forced to play special cards quickly in certain situations.

717
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:44,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you can lay out like I'll often.

718
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:47,499
Speaker 0: when I played with Scott I don't think it didn't work.

719
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:55,056
Speaker 0: But I tried to set up columns hoping that Scott would throw a special card into it To basically draw it out and then I jump over someone else and try to win.

720
00:47:55,076 --> 00:48:01,440
Speaker 1: Yep But the thing about this game that really got me is that you really don't want to play a car every turn.

721
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,247
Speaker 0: I'm like, ah, I don't want to play any of these.

722
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, you play one in any column.

723
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,720
Speaker 0: You've committed that fucking column.

724
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't take any cards back except for like a couple special cards that let you do stuff like that.

725
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,920
Speaker 1: So it's like you pretty much never want to play a card, but you have to play one on your turn.

726
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,850
Speaker 1: But then you have the satisfaction of knowing your opponent feels the same way.

727
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:21,540
Speaker 0: You pretty much have to throw cards away.

728
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got a couple of columns.

729
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:31,460
Speaker 1: There are a couple of columns that you just to give up on and sort of go for a lower Arrangement and hopefully, you know your if you want your opponent to go first.

730
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:48,537
Speaker 1: So if he if he commits a column to be a dumping column and he's played a second card on it and you know That his maximum formation for that column is really weak then you can go for that column with also a relatively low Formation that's just slightly better than his trash formation and win that column.

731
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,400
Speaker 1: and thus I also have a dumping ground for cards that you can't use in really high-powered formations.

732
00:48:53,822 --> 00:48:56,054
Speaker 0: I almost always draw a special card first.

733
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:57,140
Speaker 0: Can you play one draw one?

734
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,613
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you definitely want to get one right away because you start out with zero.

735
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:03,500
Speaker 0: so it's always good to have one Yeah, and I'll usually get a second one pretty early.

736
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:09,468
Speaker 0: So should I know what my options are cuz I'm not gonna see that many special cards throughout the game Yeah, and there aren't that many.

737
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:10,812
Speaker 0: so having two means.

738
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,799
Speaker 0: I know my opponent does not have those two.

739
00:49:13,342 --> 00:49:16,780
Speaker 1: The thing is right is when we played we really held back on the special cards.

740
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,876
Speaker 1: Right either because we were held back by the other guy or because we were both holding.

741
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:21,920
Speaker 0: I hold back on purpose.

742
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:32,920
Speaker 0: I always want you or my opponent to get ahead in the game early with special cards because then they can't play anymore and I whip all mine out at the end and there's basically nothing the player can do about it.

743
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like I wonder what would happen if both people let loose with the special cards and burn through that deck.

744
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:39,580
Speaker 0: He's run out and then the game would continue.

745
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,973
Speaker 1: I think the game would actually end much more quickly because I don't think it would.

746
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:47,339
Speaker 0: just very few of them will actually win one For you and some of them actually make you need more cards.

747
00:49:47,581 --> 00:49:54,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that the vast majority of you know If I was gonna play a special card It's because it was gonna lock a column in or two columns.

748
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,460
Speaker 0: But having too many special cards you won't have anything to lock a column with.

749
00:49:59,725 --> 00:50:00,199
Speaker 1: That's true.

750
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:09,460
Speaker 0: The game you gotta sort of wait for like the first bit of the game to pass And the brain feel of this game kind of like, you know food critics talk about the mouth feel of a food.

751
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:14,096
Speaker 0: The brain feel of this game is very much like as I've said a million times hearts or Euchre or anything.

752
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,547
Speaker 0: I'm counting cards I'm counting straights.

753
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:24,080
Speaker 0: It's trickier because I can't use all the mnemonics I've built up over the years for you know games like hearts because there's six suits and there's ten cards per suit.

754
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:26,291
Speaker 0: So my card counting like.

755
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:27,900
Speaker 1: I actually fucked that up big time.

756
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:34,233
Speaker 1: There was a time in the game when I was looking around that I saw three twos in the table and a two in my hand And I was like, ah, there's no way rim has it too.

757
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:36,407
Speaker 0: And then I played two more twos And then he played two more twos.

758
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:39,648
Speaker 1: I was like, oh right this fucking six colors I totally fucked up the whole thing.

759
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the mental equations I have don't work.

760
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,663
Speaker 0: So I got a wing it and I guess I'm happy that I was able to able to wing it pretty well and kind of fuzzy Logic my way through.

761
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:48,245
Speaker 0: Yeah.

762
00:50:48,566 --> 00:50:52,617
Speaker 0: Now this game is actually a just a straight remake of an older kinesia game.

763
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:53,380
Speaker 0: shot and totin.

764
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:56,739
Speaker 0: I never heard of that shot and totin is the same game without special cards.

765
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,926
Speaker 1: Oh Interesting.

766
00:50:57,967 --> 00:51:00,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he basically said this game is pretty cool.

767
00:51:00,442 --> 00:51:04,120
Speaker 0: He added the tactics cards added one more card to each suit and made a new game.

768
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,604
Speaker 1: Did it originally have the Greek theme?

769
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:09,817
Speaker 0: No, it's themed based on like mountain people.

770
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:13,703
Speaker 1: The Greek theme is much better Javelins and shit.

771
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:14,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

772
00:51:14,526 --> 00:51:15,550
Speaker 0: Oh, I zoomed in more.

773
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,694
Speaker 0: It's based on Scotsman.

774
00:51:16,714 --> 00:51:18,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're all fighting.

775
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:21,270
Speaker 0: Okay, beating each other ahead with bagpipes.

776
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:22,153
Speaker 1: Nice.

777
00:51:22,835 --> 00:51:24,079
Speaker 0: That's a bare ass right there.

778
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:25,280
Speaker 1: Okay.

779
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:34,259
Speaker 0: So there's another game that we played recently Yep, Rico, which we played at zenk icon randomly because a guy was there and he's like, it's cool game.

780
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:37,455
Speaker 0: Let's play Yep, and he taught us how to play and that's the thing.

781
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:39,548
Speaker 1: if you go to a convention This is just some random advice.

782
00:51:39,669 --> 00:51:41,140
Speaker 1: right you go to the gaming library.

783
00:51:41,461 --> 00:51:47,120
Speaker 1: There's always gonna be these weird games like you've never seen them before and they're just sort of sitting there like that hex bug game.

784
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:50,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you'll see a game that looks like a weird game.

785
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:51,700
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck is this, right?

786
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,102
Speaker 1: You don't even.

787
00:51:52,384 --> 00:52:00,360
Speaker 1: it's the kind of game you just overlook it cuz it's so inconspicuous And it doesn't stand out as being a big game or popular game or a fancy game.

788
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,005
Speaker 1: It's just sort of game.

789
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:04,265
Speaker 1: You don't recognize you never seen it before But it's hiding.

790
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:06,050
Speaker 1: play those games cuz.

791
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,415
Speaker 1: well, some of them suck.

792
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:15,722
Speaker 1: You're gonna find hidden gems in there All right, so Rico is one of those games just like an oddball, you know game that like was totally inconspicuous Didn't?

793
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:16,627
Speaker 1: wasn't popular?

794
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:18,680
Speaker 1: never heard of it before just sitting on the table.

795
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:21,249
Speaker 1: But we played it and we discovered something kind of good.

796
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,513
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's.

797
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:30,980
Speaker 0: it's another card kind of game Where you've got suits and you play cards, but the way it works, there's four colors four tiles for love You know for like it's for trash plants.

798
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:38,300
Speaker 0: So when you play cards from your hand, you can play any number of cards But you have to play at least one of one color.

799
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:47,000
Speaker 0: So if I have like four red and one green I could play one green or one two three or four red Yep, and you have to play it on the column that matches the color.

800
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,060
Speaker 1: So your red cards have to go in the red trash bin and your yellow cards is to go in the yellow trash bin.

801
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:57,320
Speaker 0: You then draw from that same pile like the same column on the other side of this middle card.

802
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:04,560
Speaker 0: Right the all the cards that are there and it's always replenished to be One plus the number of cards that are already on the top.

803
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:08,960
Speaker 1: So for example at the beginning of the game every trash bin has one card in it, which is a random card.

804
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,880
Speaker 1: So let's say the green trash bin has a blue card in it, right?

805
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:15,693
Speaker 1: I can play any number of green cards into the green trash bin.

806
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:17,580
Speaker 1: So I play two into the green trash bin.

807
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:20,429
Speaker 1: I then take that one blue card that's in there.

808
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,060
Speaker 1: now because there are two in the green trash bin We draw three at random.

809
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:32,420
Speaker 1: So the next person who puts any green cards in the green bin takes those three random cards that are now in there.

810
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,423
Speaker 0: Yep So you as you play closer to because basically once you hit four In.

811
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:43,229
Speaker 0: so if someone puts in a number of cards on a column that makes the total of cards that were put in by players Four or more.

812
00:53:43,249 --> 00:53:44,379
Speaker 0: they all go away.

813
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:49,420
Speaker 0: They take a little token which has a number of victory points on it starting at zero.

814
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:50,780
Speaker 0: We'll save the numbers on them.

815
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,266
Speaker 0: But it's a number of victory points on it.

816
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,440
Speaker 0: you take that into your hand and then you take all the cards at the edge.

817
00:53:55,661 --> 00:54:01,720
Speaker 1: So if you're the one who finishes off a particular trash plant and puts it over the top You get some victory points from the chips.

818
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,800
Speaker 1: But you're also probably gonna take a whole bunch of cards into your hand from the other side of it because it's close to full.

819
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:13,120
Speaker 1: So it's probably gonna have three at least three probably four cards in it.

820
00:54:13,301 --> 00:54:23,162
Speaker 0: And thus the trick with this game Anytime you draw cards into your hand that are greater than five you have to discard down to five and every one you discard is Negative.

821
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:24,086
Speaker 0: one victory points.

822
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:24,347
Speaker 1: now.

823
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:29,069
Speaker 1: think about that right I play one card at the beginning of the game I play two and I draw one.

824
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:30,737
Speaker 1: so now I've decreased my hand size by one.

825
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:31,079
Speaker 1: That's good.

826
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:32,724
Speaker 1: Then I play.

827
00:54:32,904 --> 00:54:35,251
Speaker 1: you know two and I probably draw like three.

828
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:38,780
Speaker 1: your hand size is growing for hand size grows over five.

829
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:40,666
Speaker 1: You lose points basically.

830
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:45,420
Speaker 1: so everyone pretty much poisons the well and makes all the trash plants super dangerous.

831
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,644
Speaker 1: So that way taking victory points is gonna actually cost you victory points because even though you get a chip That's worth points.

832
00:54:51,946 --> 00:54:53,653
Speaker 1: You're also going to lose points.

833
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:55,260
Speaker 1: We're having too many cards at the same time.

834
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,170
Speaker 0: Yep, so you lose points a lot of points for illegally dumping.

835
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:04,647
Speaker 0: now if you manage to make through the whole game without ever Illegally dumping you get a pretty crazy bonus.

836
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:05,430
Speaker 1: Good luck with that shit.

837
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,337
Speaker 0: very rarely does anyone pull that ever.

838
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:08,060
Speaker 0: never.

839
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:09,628
Speaker 0: I've seen it, but it's pretty rare.

840
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:15,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the other shit to the game Is that the time the tokens that get positive victory points on there's.

841
00:55:15,374 --> 00:55:16,860
Speaker 0: there's a little pile on each column.

842
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:23,097
Speaker 0: The values go zero one two three three negative two four five.

843
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:24,762
Speaker 1: Right.

844
00:55:24,782 --> 00:55:35,580
Speaker 1: so if you take the zero or the one you're actually probably gonna be losing points in total or cut breaking even because even Though you took a chip you're gonna lose points from taking too many cards.

845
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:36,745
Speaker 1: So if you're the you know.

846
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:39,880
Speaker 1: if you take the zeros and the ones your score is actually going down.

847
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,399
Speaker 0: Typical end scores of this game are between negative four and three.

848
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:47,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you're if you make it to the it's it's pretty.

849
00:55:48,097 --> 00:55:53,960
Speaker 1: if you play good Well, you can get to the end of the game with scores of like zero, right?

850
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,740
Speaker 1: And then if you manage to be the one to take like the four or the five chip You're gonna get a lot.

851
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:17,093
Speaker 1: It's a lot of points right there and that will probably win you the game As soon as somebody takes a five chip the game of men ends immediately which makes it really really rough because This that's you know, there's 20 points worth of five chips But only five of those points actually get delivered to anybody.

852
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:24,560
Speaker 0: now the game's a little less strategic I would say than battle line because you have less information and you pretty much got to play it one turn at a time.

853
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:25,685
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

854
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:28,780
Speaker 0: This is a game where there are like it is it is partly random.

855
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,763
Speaker 0: It is mostly random.

856
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:35,739
Speaker 0: many times when I lose or win or Scott loses or wins it is obvious that there was no better decision The person could have made.

857
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,674
Speaker 0: But there are ways to optimize your play of this game one.

858
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:42,640
Speaker 0: You have to count cards religiously.

859
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:44,708
Speaker 0: You've got to know what's in everyone's hand.

860
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:45,069
Speaker 1: Remember?

861
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,940
Speaker 1: Nobody's drawing any cards that are face down.

862
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,340
Speaker 1: They're only drawing face-up cards other than their initial loadout other than their initial cards.

863
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,994
Speaker 1: But what if they do go over five?

864
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:56,160
Speaker 1: they discard some car?

865
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:58,405
Speaker 0: What they discarded.

866
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:01,192
Speaker 1: but you know what all the possibilities are.

867
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,780
Speaker 1: so it's possible to remember what's in everyone else's.

868
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,620
Speaker 0: No A human is probably not going to remember it exactly because that's kind of difficult to do.

869
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:11,895
Speaker 1: But all you really need to know is like does he have green?

870
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:13,020
Speaker 1: does he have to green?

871
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,960
Speaker 1: You know, that's all you really have to remember is like does he have this color?

872
00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:17,730
Speaker 1: How many of that color does he have?

873
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,280
Speaker 1: you don't need to memorize this entire hand?

874
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,954
Speaker 0: So this is a good game for practicing these kind of deep strategies.

875
00:57:22,995 --> 00:57:23,959
Speaker 0: So, you know buy this game.

876
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:24,260
Speaker 0: It's cheap.

877
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:24,966
Speaker 0: I bought these games.

878
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:26,479
Speaker 0: They're both pretty great if you can find them.

879
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:34,120
Speaker 0: But for Rico really played as a warm-up game to another game and while your friends will be good or bad or whatever The game is kind of random.

880
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:36,868
Speaker 0: It's a great game to practice some very important skills.

881
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:44,528
Speaker 0: pay attention and try to count cards learn mnemonics learn how to know Pretty reliably what's in everyone else's hands?

882
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:49,699
Speaker 0: Yep, and to count how many cards are already in play I've already come out.

883
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,373
Speaker 0: So, you know what's remaining in the deck what the statistical odds are of getting one card over another?

884
00:57:54,393 --> 00:58:03,320
Speaker 0: and if you if you maximize those Skills you will slightly increase your chance of winning this game and you will greatly increase your chance of winning most other games.

885
00:58:03,621 --> 00:58:09,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, for example, if the let's say the five point is open on the red on the red plant, right?

886
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,700
Speaker 1: I know that rim has two red cards.

887
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:16,500
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna play two red cards because that would allow him to put it up to four and take the five.

888
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,269
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play one red card there.

889
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:23,820
Speaker 1: that way he can at best put it up to three Which means I'll be able to take the five if I have another red card.

890
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:30,607
Speaker 0: The second thing you need to do is and this game is almost identical Mathematically to a game I call sticks.

891
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:38,699
Speaker 0: people call it different things where you draw like five sticks three sticks and two sticks like lines On a piece of paper and you take turns crossing off any number of sticks in one row.

892
00:58:39,443 --> 00:58:46,032
Speaker 0: Whoever picks up the last stick by crossing it off Loses and the game alternates effectively between stable and unstable states.

893
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:49,806
Speaker 0: an unstable state meaning one where someone can Push the game to ending.

894
00:58:50,288 --> 00:58:52,720
Speaker 0: a stable state meaning it the game will continue.

895
00:58:53,282 --> 00:59:00,439
Speaker 0: So you want the game to be in an unstable state because if it's in an unstable state and the other person messes up Or is forced to make a move then you win.

896
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:06,302
Speaker 0: So you want to make the game as unstable as possible when it's not your turn and as stable as possible when it is your Turn.

897
00:59:06,322 --> 00:59:12,956
Speaker 1: yeah, so it's like aha no matter which pile you go into this turn You will lose points because they're all at minus two and they all have three cards in them.

898
00:59:12,976 --> 00:59:16,552
Speaker 0: So you've got to learn Basically modulus math.

899
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:23,080
Speaker 0: while you're doing all this You've got to be able to count forward through the game iteratively and be able to say my turn his turn.

900
00:59:23,381 --> 00:59:26,617
Speaker 0: He'll have to play something that will make one of those twos go away.

901
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:32,520
Speaker 0: his turn I'll be good and then from there you decide how much to stabilize or destabilize the game on your turn.

902
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:35,139
Speaker 0: Those are the only two skills in this game.

903
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:39,180
Speaker 1: It's pretty much you got to take turns poisoning the well and drinking from the well.

904
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:44,640
Speaker 1: Right, you're gonna drink poison and if somebody drinks from the well, there's no poison left because they drank it all.

905
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,570
Speaker 1: So it's like all right my turn I poison it.

906
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:48,995
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do on your turn?

907
00:59:49,035 --> 00:59:50,560
Speaker 0: double poison double poison?

908
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,654
Speaker 1: All right, my turn I have to drink great now the zero poison.

909
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,717
Speaker 1: So what does room do on his turn?

910
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:56,420
Speaker 1: poison again?

911
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,920
Speaker 0: Oh Gertrude, right?

912
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:07,460
Speaker 1: So it's like you want to be the poison or not the drinker as much as possible but you're gonna drink the poison because Right, cuz eventually all the wells are poisoned and you're thirsty.

913
01:00:08,281 --> 01:00:12,739
Speaker 0: So they're two great warm-up games and I recommend if you see them for cheap just pick them both up.

914
01:00:13,103 --> 01:00:14,439
Speaker 1: Rico might be harder to find.

915
01:00:15,241 --> 01:00:19,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had some trouble getting it on Amazon and the first two vendors.

916
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:23,239
Speaker 0: I bought it from Apologetically emailed me later saying they couldn't actually find it.

917
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:26,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, but battle line shouldn't be that hard from any board game.

918
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:33,365
Speaker 0: specialty shop Yeah, and you could make shot and taught and if you wanted to pretty easily for the deck of cards Yeah, you can just take a break.

919
01:00:33,405 --> 01:00:33,686
Speaker 1: You just.

920
01:00:33,787 --> 01:00:40,938
Speaker 1: you just need 60 cards 10 of each color and You know nine little two ponds and you could you could play the game.

921
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:50,050
Speaker 0: Yep This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
