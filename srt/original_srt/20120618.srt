00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,676
Speaker 1: It's Monday June 18th 2012.

00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:11,820

Speaker 1: laptops.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,248
Speaker 0: Alright, rawr Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:27,510
Speaker 0: Are you want to hear some good stuff?

7
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:28,456
Speaker 1: possibly alright?

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,008
Speaker 0: This is the kind of material that people love.

9
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,377
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna dish it out, so it's poop and food.

10
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:34,020
Speaker 0: it is poop.

11
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:48,126
Speaker 1: So If we're gonna poop anecdotes, I got an anecdote myself, but go on Alright, so I feel like every human being.

12
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:53,350
Speaker 0: on Saturday I'm biking and I decided to bike to the beach because it was all nice out and I say Rockaway.

13
00:00:53,531 --> 00:01:00,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I succeeded in doing so and I went over the Adobo bridge which I will now call the Obobo bridge.

14
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:01,645
Speaker 1: Ah so you went over.

15
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,007
Speaker 1: I didn't.

16
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,917
Speaker 1: last time I went out there I didn't go over that bridge.

17
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,830
Speaker 1: It was already like five o'clock when I got out there.

18
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:07,538
Speaker 0: Well, I left at 1030.

19
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:10,350
Speaker 0: I got to the above bridge like less than noon even right.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,928
Speaker 0: It's like it's a short ride if you push it.

21
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:12,351
Speaker 0: well I went.

22
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:14,761
Speaker 0: I went you know extra a ways right.

23
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:17,070
Speaker 0: so I went to Queens and then I went to these two other parks.

24
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:21,009
Speaker 0: There's one that's the south part of the Corona Park, and then there's.

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,037
Speaker 0: oh So you went out and then down went out and down and then is the forest park Which I didn't know about till recently.

26
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:38,450
Speaker 0: so when the forest park, and then I went to the Bobo bridge, so You go over the Obobo bridge And there's like this little landing there and on the left side you can see JFK and on the east side you can see Manhattan from real far away.

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:45,220
Speaker 0: And there's like this little like landing area with like a little building and a parking lot And it's like tiny little show or outcropping.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,324
Speaker 0: you can even go under the bridge.

29
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,030
Speaker 0: There's real fishing good times.

30
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:53,750
Speaker 0: And then you go over the thing the Veterans Memorial Bridge And then you're on the beach, and it's weird because it's like it's Wildwood.

31
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,670
Speaker 0: But if you turn around you can sort of see Manhattan way over there over yonder.

32
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:00,430
Speaker 0: So now I kind of want to get a little house over there.

33
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,599
Speaker 0: He got a weekend house, and then on Friday after work.

34
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,601
Speaker 0: We can bike over there, and then on Sunday We all right tell you what you pay for half of it.

35
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:08,526
Speaker 0: all right.

36
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,449
Speaker 0: They had co-ops there.

37
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,582
Speaker 0: There's a building full of co-ops.

38
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:11,209
Speaker 0: They're trying to sell.

39
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,069
Speaker 0: Anyway right on the beach anyway, so you know I go out there.

40
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,950
Speaker 0: I'm biking down the boardwalk right to go west to take the Gil Hodges bridge which goes to Brooklyn which goes back to New York.

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:31,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, so going west down the boardwalk And my stomach hurts, and I'm like huh, it's probably this bumpy ass boardwalk.

42
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:34,797
Speaker 1: Usually that is not the cause of stomach hurt.

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:43,232
Speaker 1: that was simply you trying to postpone the inevitable The.

44
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:53,579
Speaker 0: the Rockaway was quite longer than I expected right, and I'm you know I get down to like this other I think it's called Reese Park, and then you know to get to this bridge I was like wow it's kind of you know.

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,550
Speaker 0: on the map the map was basically lying to me.

46
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,334
Speaker 0: I thought it would be like.

47
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:59,210
Speaker 1: so you're on that gigantic bike path that just goes like forever.

48
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:07,274
Speaker 0: I took the boardwalk, and then I had to like do some tricks to like get over the highway to the other North part of Rockaway, so I got.

49
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:16,487
Speaker 0: actually get on the bridge and basically you know like when I was up in the other area You know in Queens there were plenty of like porta potties everywhere and everything.

50
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:17,715
Speaker 0: it was all good You know.

51
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:37,750
Speaker 0: but in this area not so much Crowded beach people everywhere even on like side paths like this dude fishing this you know not exactly a wooded area All right, so I go over the this bridge And I sort of get to this area where it's like crazy highway, and you're sort of getting back into Brooklyn.

52
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,054
Speaker 0: But and it's.

53
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,384
Speaker 0: but it's very tricky to figure out like exactly how to get.

54
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:47,262
Speaker 1: I know where you were yeah But it's like this kind of mall nearby.

55
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:47,403
Speaker 1: Well.

56
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:50,189
Speaker 0: No if you look on the map It's where I originally wanted to go.

57
00:03:50,370 --> 00:04:00,203
Speaker 0: It's sort of like this is airfield there, and you can theoretically bike on the airfield on the runways, but it's not JFK It's a small plate right yeah, but I didn't go in there cuz I had to go elsewhere.

58
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:12,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, so Apparently like right after the bridge like you know most of everyone was going straight And I saw this little you know path went into the woods, and I'm like hot diggity dog going to the woods.

59
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:29,404
Speaker 0: So I go right into the woods And I go deep into the woods is get a little maze like in there, and I'm like well This is good right, but this pads this pads in the woods, but it's sort of maze ish, and I'm looking around And I'm listening and it's not like I could go physically into the woods.

60
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,794
Speaker 0: all I can really do is go like near the pass.

61
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:38,160
Speaker 1: you're trying to get just far enough away from people to Yeah, yeah, yeah, so anyway.

62
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,375
Speaker 0: I laid down two logs and then Use some leaves.

63
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:45,164
Speaker 0: there was some good leaves there that I knew were not well.

64
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,047
Speaker 1: What do you lay down?

65
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:46,690
Speaker 1: two logs?

66
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,616
Speaker 1: Just pop a squat.

67
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,650
Speaker 0: That's what I did lay down two logs.

68
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:52,581
Speaker 1: Okay, this for some reason.

69
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:58,753
Speaker 1: I had this image of you Taking two logs and laying them next to each other than sitting on that and then laying down to know There's.

70
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,289
Speaker 0: no there were no logs of that nature.

71
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:05,945
Speaker 1: You know the one time I ever had to poop in the woods unprepared.

72
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,210
Speaker 1: I've been camping where you dig a hole.

73
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:15,770
Speaker 1: But the one time there's in high school I was out biking same thing with a bunch of people and I had to poop like all day.

74
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,494
Speaker 1: But I just didn't.

75
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,908
Speaker 1: I was busy like all day, and then we're out biking.

76
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:25,446
Speaker 1: I'm like all right I'm gonna go home and poop and I was getting to be crisis situation, so I figured hey Let's go through the woods as a park.

77
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,618
Speaker 1: here I got to use the bathroom and bike through the woods.

78
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:30,590
Speaker 1: we get to the park bathrooms locked cuz it's like midnight.

79
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:32,955
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna make it.

80
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,190
Speaker 1: so I basically just bike off into the woods in the dark like down this trail.

81
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,398
Speaker 0: This is broad daylight.

82
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,764
Speaker 0: There was no darkness whatsoever.

83
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:49,310
Speaker 1: the problem with the darkness Is that there's no way to tell if the delivery was clean or any sort of follow-up there, so basically I rocketed one out.

84
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,538
Speaker 1: It was one and it was a rocket.

85
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,963
Speaker 0: so the thing is right is I laid him out there I wiped with some leaves that were pretty good and worked pretty well.

86
00:05:59,024 --> 00:05:59,746
Speaker 1: No poison ivy.

87
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:00,289
Speaker 0: No it was.

88
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:04,670
Speaker 0: no No, it was like a real tree, so it's just like normal poison sumac like a maple tree or something.

89
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 0: You know it's real normal leaves there.

90
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,730
Speaker 0: They're nice and big they worked anyway.

91
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:22,529
Speaker 0: but then I got sort of fascinated because Okay go on because even though like you know it was a clear day It didn't you know there was really nothing you know in the air.

92
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:30,337
Speaker 0: But like within seconds like tons of flies came out of nowhere All over that poop Scott mmM.

93
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:31,361
Speaker 1: So a flies dude.

94
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,505
Speaker 0: I know but it's like they.

95
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,253
Speaker 0: there were no flies Scott.

96
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:42,088
Speaker 1: it'd be like then suddenly tons of like we're in Wildwood You know or an arcade anywhere, and you hear that fourth mix off in the distance like hot shit come.

97
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:44,860
Speaker 1: Except imagine if what is.

98
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,690
Speaker 1: fourth mix to you is poop to that fly.

99
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:56,290
Speaker 1: I know right now we're at RIT and when you heard a rumor there might be and a DDR machine somewhere in the vicinity of campus anyway.

100
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:02,070
Speaker 1: So the final bit of the story right okay, so the story was you pooped in the woods and no one saw you right?

101
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:13,850
Speaker 0: So while I'm examining the flies right and by extension the poop right I Hear two people coming down from the opposite direction, and I made a getaway, and I think they saw me make a getaway.

102
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,890
Speaker 1: You should have been like oh my God someone pooped here.

103
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,015
Speaker 0: No But they didn't like.

104
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:21,269
Speaker 0: you know I just thought like they saw a guy.

105
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:25,009
Speaker 0: Look at them quickly as they were maybe like 50 feet away.

106
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:26,896
Speaker 0: Get on a bike and go the opposite.

107
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:31,821
Speaker 1: by doing that you cemented in their heads the idea that whoever that was that's cool Because they were walking.

108
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:32,570
Speaker 0: they didn't have bikes.

109
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,029
Speaker 0: There's no way they ever caught up with me or saw me or knew me.

110
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,670
Speaker 1: You know I'm gonna laugh so hard if we get an email.

111
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,289
Speaker 1: It was like I was in the woods the other day, and I some guy pooped and ran off.

112
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,738
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone will try to say that maybe just because you said that.

113
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,787
Speaker 0: but yeah Then I biked home.

114
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,140
Speaker 0: It's Monday, but I didn't get to go.

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,912
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go back is now I want to go to the airfield that it's Monday It's science day, but first you reminded me.

116
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,460
Speaker 1: I might make this an extra thing today sure enough.

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,110
Speaker 1: Poop report is still going nice.

118
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,803
Speaker 1: Oh my that's a blast from 2000 and poo.

119
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

120
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,929
Speaker 1: So you got a news all right.

121
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:09,511
Speaker 0: so check this out.

122
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,139
Speaker 0: This is I guess this counts as news, right?

123
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,137
Speaker 0: So you know Apple came out with them new MacBooks.

124
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,925
Speaker 0: They did and you know the.

125
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:24,860
Speaker 0: they have the quote retina display on the MacBook Pro 15-inch And they canceled the 17-inch completely which is that was a good move cuz yeah who what the fuck wants that thing?

126
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,030
Speaker 1: I don't know anyone who has that seriously right.

127
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,073
Speaker 1: well the thing is there are.

128
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:30,076
Speaker 1: there are cases.

129
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,365
Speaker 1: You know if we're talking about laptops There's like.

130
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:35,820
Speaker 1: there's the case of the ultra portable like super tiny laptop.

131
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,544
Speaker 1: That's to go.

132
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,260
Speaker 1: and then there's the giant laptop you put in your check bag.

133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,472
Speaker 0: That's 15 inches.

134
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:43,567
Speaker 0: the giant laptop 17 should not exist.

135
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,813
Speaker 1: I could see you might as well.

136
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,320
Speaker 0: Just bring a monitor and a desktop with you 17 inches still way smaller.

137
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:56,240
Speaker 1: So wait monitors are actually a giant pain in the ass to transport.

138
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:01,774
Speaker 1: Anyway though the x230 has an option for the external second monitor.

139
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,931
Speaker 0: see Apple loves external adapters so much Right you know what.

140
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:10,478
Speaker 0: I don't understand Why they don't do this which is make an adapter you can buy for 50 bucks that has all sorts of video inputs.

141
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:17,059
Speaker 0: well in Their case it would have one video input which would be the Thunderbolt whatever right or each mini HDMI Whatever the hell they use yeah.

142
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,510
Speaker 0: And then the other end goes into the iPad.

143
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,619
Speaker 0: so you can basically use an iPad as a monitor with this $50 Thingy attached to it.

144
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,007
Speaker 1: That would be a great idea.

145
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:28,920
Speaker 0: I got by iPads just uses monitors, but anyway.

146
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,188
Speaker 0: So the thing is the.

147
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:35,780
Speaker 0: you know the resolution of this new MacBook is incredible.

148
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,949
Speaker 0: It's 2880 by 1800. yeah.

149
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:38,812
Speaker 1: meanwhile the laptop.

150
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:43,213
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about buying has I think 1330 by.

151
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:48,672
Speaker 0: yeah my 24 inch monitor at work doesn't have 2880 by 1800 it's 19 something by 1200 right and this is only 15 inches.

152
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,453
Speaker 0: So this is 220 ppi.

153
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:54,340
Speaker 0: that is pretty great.

154
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:59,820
Speaker 1: There is no you know discussion in that factor other than you'll have some trouble playing games at that resolution.

155
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:08,232
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, well you're gonna have trouble playing games on the Mac anyway And it's you know it's 15 inch laptop.

156
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:08,856
Speaker 0: who wants that?

157
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:14,332
Speaker 0: but Whatever, so the thing is it's 220 pixels per inch.

158
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:23,580
Speaker 0: and the thing is when they originally came out with retina Right it was on the iPhone 4 which I have which is like 300 something pixels per inch.

159
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:24,585
Speaker 0: Oh, here's a little chart.

160
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:24,826
Speaker 1: Well.

161
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:27,419
Speaker 1: It has to do with the distance from your eyeball right.

162
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:41,498
Speaker 0: well That's the bullshit line that they gave you which is you know well since you hold the iPad a little further away from yourself we can still call it retina if You you know if it is less ppi because you're not holding it as close to your face as a phone.

163
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:46,910
Speaker 0: It's like Well you keep a laptop even farther away right.

164
00:10:46,930 --> 00:11:00,180
Speaker 1: so by that logic right my that that 800 by 600 non-native CRT that I had Was retina if I stand across the room exactly, but they you know they're basically making to just shoot.

165
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,040
Speaker 0: They're arbitrarily choosing how many inches they think you know is normal to be away from it to make this thing correct.

166
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:09,532
Speaker 0: Here's the problem and this great article explains the whole thing.

167
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,040
Speaker 0: their assumption of retina, right?

168
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,067
Speaker 0: is based on 2020 vision.

169
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,359
Speaker 0: and apparently 2020 vision is not what you think it is.

170
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:24,278
Speaker 0: 2020 vision means you can read that you're like the average person reading the eye chart from 20 feet away.

171
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:35,817
Speaker 0: Yeah Apparently like you know if most people have better than 2020 2020 is the standard of this or better is considered effectively perfect vision.

172
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:42,491
Speaker 0: because Measuring better doesn't matter no But the point is 2020 isn't even close to perfect vision.

173
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:49,104
Speaker 0: people who don't have eye problems can mostly see way better than Even people with eye problems With classes.

174
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:52,517
Speaker 1: corrective lenses can make give you better than normal human vision already.

175
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:58,480
Speaker 0: so like you know I could say I have 2020 vision But the point is I could read the eye chart from farther than 20 feet away.

176
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:04,679
Speaker 1: Right you want to have an eye chart contest and be in my cyborg glasses versus you and your Biological.

177
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:09,454
Speaker 0: I will play the eye chart game with anyone any time I think I would.

178
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:15,580
Speaker 1: we need an Neutral to make an eye chart that neither one of us has ever seen before but at least according to this article right he says.

179
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,960
Speaker 0: But while 2020 vision might traditionally refer to standard vision most research suggests that normal vision is actually much better than 2020.

180
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,015
Speaker 0: In fact people with normal vision usually won't see their eyesight degrade to 2020 until they are 60 or 70 years of age.

181
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,779
Speaker 0: So when I'm maybe 70 then I'll have 20/20 vision, right?

182
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:41,532
Speaker 0: So the thing is he calculates based on a who knows what kind of math that I don't understand What it really takes to get a real retina display.

183
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,800
Speaker 0: So it's like at first I thought Apple was bullshitting.

184
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,856
Speaker 0: I thought that the iPhone 4 was retina and the other ones weren't.

185
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,648
Speaker 0: now In fact, none of them are retina right.

186
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:58,982
Speaker 0: in order for the iPhone at three and a half inches to be retina the resolution would need to be 2772 by 1848 which is 952 PPI.

187
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:05,440
Speaker 0: Right, and this is even giving, you know Apple their inch distance calculation, right?

188
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, iPad would need to be 59 68 by 44 86 which is 769 PPI.

189
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,108
Speaker 0: It's and he gives a whole chart here.

190
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:19,819
Speaker 0: He also shows is the cool part You know the ultra high-resolution image of Earth that NASA lets you download.

191
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:29,720
Speaker 0: Yeah he shows you how much of it you'll be able to see at once in full resolution on a theoretically true retina device and None of them can see the whole thing.

192
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,795
Speaker 0: But the 27-inch iMac at true retina.

193
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:39,699
Speaker 0: by his calculations you can see almost the whole thing at once because it's sort of widescreen and there's a lot of black area on the sides.

194
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,022
Speaker 0: and He's you know.

195
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:42,905
Speaker 0: on the one hand.

196
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:47,058
Speaker 0: it's annoying because it means right now our monitors aren't as good as we.

197
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,366
Speaker 0: you know That's as they're saying they are.

198
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:54,405
Speaker 0: but he's very happy about this actually because it means hey Shit's only gonna get better.

199
00:13:54,726 --> 00:14:00,524
Speaker 0: even though he doesn't bring in any sort of monitor technology knowledge into this Showing that it's possible.

200
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:08,498
Speaker 0: He just sort of makes the assumption that we're just gonna keep making higher resolution monitors forever until we get them to be so high resolution that it's true retina.

201
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:17,962
Speaker 0: and Then he's excited about that because it means you'd be able to look at your monitor and not even be able to tell That it's like, you know a camera or you know Like.

202
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:24,626
Speaker 0: you'll look at it and you won't even be able to tell that it's rim versus a picture of rim Right looking at the at the thing.

203
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:24,847
Speaker 1: Yeah.

204
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:30,840
Speaker 1: Well the true the trouble we'll run into is display technology is one thing but also the processing power.

205
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:32,820
Speaker 1: Exactly make images like that.

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:46,340
Speaker 0: He sort of makes his assumption that we're just gonna keep advancing with pixels per inch the same way that say hard drive space or CPU Cycles, you know keep increasing and he doesn't bring any knowledge of actual how LCDs work or LCD technology or even cam.

207
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:46,963
Speaker 1: I don't think it'll.

208
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:50,499
Speaker 0: cameras have to get better and you know cameras have to get better.

209
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:51,986
Speaker 0: Processes have to get better.

210
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:53,754
Speaker 0: all these things have to get exponentially better.

211
00:14:53,795 --> 00:15:01,958
Speaker 0: be able to push these pixels I think it's a longer ways out than he thinks it may even be something that we see later in our lives.

212
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,579
Speaker 0: to get true You know that many pixels per inch?

213
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:12,000
Speaker 1: Well at the same time It's hard to say because technology is moving moving both slower than I'd ever hoped and faster than I could ever have imagined.

214
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:13,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's always weird.

215
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,120
Speaker 0: You know, what areas move right?

216
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:25,500
Speaker 0: I mean you see things for example, like, you know We've seen flexible display prototypes like e-paper for years all these flexible monitors on like a little plastic card.

217
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:30,820
Speaker 0: I haven't seen them for at least 10 years and no one's ever brought one to market for reals, right?

218
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,050
Speaker 0: But yet there are things that you've never seen a prototype of anywhere.

219
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,000
Speaker 0: and then suddenly boom here it is in stores by tomorrow.

220
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:37,629
Speaker 0: It's like whoa.

221
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,683
Speaker 0: So, yeah All right.

222
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,418
Speaker 1: So this is a little bit of kind of cool sci-fi.

223
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:48,711
Speaker 1: MIT has created a special kind of fuel cell.

224
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,640
Speaker 1: Okay, this fuel cell runs on glucose.

225
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,285
Speaker 1: You wanna know why it runs on glucose?

226
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:55,272
Speaker 0: It's full of some biological organism.

227
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:57,820
Speaker 1: Nope, so you can put it in a brain.

228
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,087
Speaker 0: Oh, I read this and it can power itself.

229
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaker 0: and well, how does your brain know to send enough glucose to it?

230
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,366
Speaker 1: The thing is it doesn't need to.

231
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 1: okay now obviously this is you know early.

232
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:13,300
Speaker 1: I don't want to do what everyone on slashdot does which is oh, here's the technology article.

233
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:19,200
Speaker 1: Clearly these scientists have not thought of all the basic simple arguments that I thought of just now.

234
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:21,966
Speaker 0: No, I know that they have.

235
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:23,692
Speaker 0: I'm just wondering what the answers are.

236
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,260
Speaker 0: because they clearly the scientists have thought of these things.

237
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know if I can think of it they can think of it.

238
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,448
Speaker 0: and and because they've published something They probably already have the answer.

239
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:32,910
Speaker 0: and I'm just.

240
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,819
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I'm smarter than the scientists I have found the problem in your thingy.

241
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,079
Speaker 0: I'm saying what solution did they come up with these obvious problems that even I could see?

242
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,854
Speaker 1: Glucose gets through the blood-brain barrier and that's what the brain uses to power itself.

243
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:46,340
Speaker 1: It doesn't so it's just in the blood.

244
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:59,179
Speaker 1: So if you have a thing like a probe in the brain that also is connected to the blood supply this thing can just strip electrons off of glucose molecules and Use that to make enough power to run a very small device.

245
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,992
Speaker 1: Now obviously the questions are more.

246
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:06,920
Speaker 1: things like it's more kind of like deus ex We're alright, I can need a power bar to power up my cybernetics.

247
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:12,832
Speaker 1: but it also means What if the technology starts eating too much power?

248
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:15,000
Speaker 1: you didn't eat enough that could get dangerous in a hurry.

249
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:20,858
Speaker 1: diabetes, uh More like well like more like the opposite of diabetes.

250
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:23,890
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean you can have diabetes both ways.

251
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:30,515
Speaker 0: right if you're a diabetic you got sugar pills and insulin Whether or not you're hyper or hypoglycemia, but the point right.

252
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:33,346
Speaker 0: the point is this good, you know It could be bad in those ways.

253
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:41,100
Speaker 1: The thing is I'm getting hopeful because there's a lot of Different, you know, we're just talking about like the retina display this one guy looked at it from this one perspective.

254
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:54,900
Speaker 1: And there's so many other factors that make it so hard to guess when it'll be a reality Cybernetic brain implants and like real cybernetics that are somehow integrated with our nervous system and augmented reality and all those things together.

255
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:05,980
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of articles in the last few years of all these kind of side Angles of that technology all starting to converge and I think I think that stuff is moving a lot faster than most people realize.

256
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:11,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I'm gonna get Google Glass Pretty much day one even if it's even if it sucks.

257
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna suck my whole life.

258
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:25,195
Speaker 0: I've been waiting since as soon as I mean there are computers They're people who have stuff like it or you know They've had it for a long time like MIT had the thing you can wear around your neck Yeah, and what's-his-name had glasses he made.

259
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:26,100
Speaker 0: what's the guys in there?

260
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,493
Speaker 1: I forget anyway, but that's you know on the curve of like people adopting things.

261
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,038
Speaker 1: That's not even early adopter.

262
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:32,680
Speaker 1: That's innovator.

263
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,494
Speaker 1: That's like one dude.

264
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:35,260
Speaker 1: I don't have time for that.

265
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,889
Speaker 1: I don't have time to be the first augmented reality, dude.

266
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:44,478
Speaker 1: I have enough time to be the second wave Meaning I can buy it in a store and it just works mostly, right?

267
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,586
Speaker 1: But I'm getting increasingly excited about this stuff Even if our generation doesn't get it.

268
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:57,207
Speaker 1: I'm kind of doubtful that'll happen in time for my brains old and decrepit, but I kinda There's a tiny chance.

269
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,959
Speaker 1: I'll be able to upload myself into a computer before my body dies.

270
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:01,504
Speaker 1: Tiny chance.

271
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:05,200
Speaker 1: the fact that we're one of the first generations for that chance is not zero.

272
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:10,356
Speaker 1: But is some zero zero zero zero one is a big deal to me.

273
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:11,380
Speaker 1: That's all.

274
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:13,518
Speaker 1: I think everyone should read this article because it's kind of neat stuff.

275
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:25,938
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day, so I don't mind dubstep and I don't hate it.

276
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,460
Speaker 1: I don't love it.

277
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,226
Speaker 1: It's a sub-genre.

278
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,193
Speaker 0: It depends on the song particularly cuz.

279
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:38,708
Speaker 0: some dubstep songs are just like And the whole time some of them right they got some other stuff mixed in there And that I think those are.

280
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:41,643
Speaker 0: you know, I could like those I like, you know I guess it just.

281
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:47,807
Speaker 1: it doesn't differentiate itself enough from a lot of other similar sub-genres for me But nonetheless, no problems with it.

282
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:49,914
Speaker 1: Someone made a great YouTube video.

283
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:51,460
Speaker 1: It's really just an audio file.

284
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:54,538
Speaker 1: This is what dubstep sounds like to old people.

285
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,223
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

286
00:19:57,304 --> 00:20:01,340
Speaker 1: I defy you to not at least almost crack up while you're listening to this especially right toward the end.

287
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:03,169
Speaker 1: That's all nice and simple.

288
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:03,612
Speaker 0: All right.

289
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,120
Speaker 0: So here's this great article I read.

290
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:07,800
Speaker 0: It's actually a two-parter or maybe even a multi-parter.

291
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,354
Speaker 0: I read all the parts that are here so far and what it's about is really fascinating.

292
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:18,980
Speaker 0: and it's because we already know Right that the language you speak has an effect on how you think about the world, right?

293
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,540
Speaker 0: You know language can you know controls thinking and vice versa, but this specifically focuses on the area of color.

294
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:38,459
Speaker 0: Right and how for example, he starts off talking about the Japanese language how there was the word Oh Right, which is the blue green stuff right which is blue and they didn't even have a word for green, right?

295
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:49,739
Speaker 1: Until like the word midori came around like very recently Right, and then as a result a lot of Japanese people don't differentiate that much between blue and green, right?

296
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,153
Speaker 0: and it's like basically someone linked to this from an anime discussion of like, huh?

297
00:20:55,293 --> 00:21:09,080
Speaker 0: Here's why sometimes you're watching an anime and The light the streetlight is blue even though in Japan if you go and look at streetlights, they're green Right, but it's like how come in the anime the streetlight was blue instead of right?

298
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,840
Speaker 0: It's because it's the same name.

299
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,160
Speaker 0: So you pick up the Crayola crayon and you know people don't you know it affects?

300
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,603
Speaker 0: How people can see?

301
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:19,354
Speaker 0: and the thing the really interesting part right was.

302
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:21,060
Speaker 0: they drew this little color grid.

303
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,304
Speaker 0: Look at the color grid, right.

304
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:30,531
Speaker 0: and they did this study where they had people look at this grid and then for example They would say all right highlight all the ones that you consider to be yellow.

305
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,980
Speaker 0: now highlight all the ones you consider to be green.

306
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:36,700
Speaker 0: Now highlight the section you consider to be of the blue chartreuse, right?

307
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:54,036
Speaker 0: And it's sort of like that It's you know even uses the XKCD comic as an example, right and pretty much it comes down to yeah everyone has different words for different colors and Depending on your language in your words, well like you captain read in advance Wars.

308
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,200
Speaker 1: It was clearly orange.

309
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,308
Speaker 1: I can prove it from screenshot.

310
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:58,713
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's orange.

311
00:21:58,893 --> 00:21:59,214
Speaker 1: Yes.

312
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,078
Speaker 0: It's the same kind of thing.

313
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:09,880
Speaker 0: So Even you know, so this it gets pretty fascinating here when he talks about how like yeah You know these people only had so many words for colors.

314
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,498
Speaker 0: so therefore they didn't differentiate between these two.

315
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:14,022
Speaker 0: and It's.

316
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:17,660
Speaker 0: it's pretty cool stuff and it's not just colorblindness, right?

317
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,660
Speaker 0: It's it's the fact that you have different words, so we don't have a word that's for different green and blue.

318
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,319
Speaker 0: So we consider them to be the same color.

319
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:32,084
Speaker 1: Yeah But at the same time and I'm looking at a screen right now and I see there's some blue and some green and the difference Is like palpable.

320
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,749
Speaker 0: Yep, but there are other people.

321
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:37,680
Speaker 0: they'd like they had a different word for green and yellow green.

322
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:39,361
Speaker 0: Right.

323
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:39,943
Speaker 0: It's like there were.

324
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,652
Speaker 0: there are distinct colors in this one particular language.

325
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:48,017
Speaker 0: So these people like they can just tell right away Oh, yeah, that's the yellow green color and that's green green.

326
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,744
Speaker 1: So well People grow.

327
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:54,117
Speaker 1: I mean did we grow up in the era of hex codes for writing HTML something like that?

328
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:54,759
Speaker 1: is that?

329
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,900
Speaker 1: yeah I mean to this day?

330
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,860
Speaker 1: I remember 23 80 23 was the color I picked to use as the font in the first blog I ever made.

331
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:08,883
Speaker 0: He even talks about Darwin was upset that he tried to teach his kids to colors and they had a really hard time for quite A few years.

332
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:11,894
Speaker 0: like there's something about kids learning to differentiate colors.

333
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,300
Speaker 0: It doesn't you know, it takes a while.

334
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:22,280
Speaker 1: I remember when I was really really young I hated the color orange because It had a whole bunch of letters in it compared to most of the other colors.

335
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,327
Speaker 0: Well the reason right.

336
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,120
Speaker 0: so the reason and nothing around with it.

337
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,400
Speaker 0: So the reason the children have a large time hard time learning the colors, right?

338
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:40,479
Speaker 0: and this is the point of the whole thing right is that Before you learn the language of the colors what their names are The right side of your brain is doing the color figuring work.

339
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:46,578
Speaker 0: But then once you learn the name of the color it switches over and the left side of the brain.

340
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:47,239
Speaker 0: does that work?

341
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,047
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

342
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:50,693
Speaker 0: you got to read this.

343
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,923
Speaker 0: it's good All right.

344
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:58,745
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment the book club book is still Qteen eight four.

345
00:23:58,906 --> 00:23:59,407
Speaker 1: I gotcha.

346
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:00,893
Speaker 0: No, I'm mixing it up.

347
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:06,547
Speaker 1: one q8 for yeah By Haruki Murakami, it's I'm pretty much done with it.

348
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:07,690
Speaker 1: I'm getting near the end.

349
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:09,886
Speaker 1: There's a character.

350
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,740
Speaker 1: I like more now than I thought I would have liked.

351
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,620
Speaker 0: There's a reason that everyone on the subway is reading this book like every day.

352
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,050
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good but most commonly seen subway book of the past months, so you should read that shit.

353
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:24,863
Speaker 0: We got any other meta stuff.

354
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:26,046
Speaker 0: you should go to our website.

355
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:27,610
Speaker 0: you should go to Kinetic on.

356
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:34,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kinetic ons coming up in Hartford, Connecticut at the Connecticut Convention Center.

357
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:38,057
Speaker 0: the heart Hartford Convention Center is the only one there, Connecticut steak.

358
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:38,820
Speaker 0: I don't know what it's called.

359
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:40,931
Speaker 0: It's the only big convention center in Hartford.

360
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:41,755
Speaker 0: There's nothing near it.

361
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:42,780
Speaker 0: It's just a convention center.

362
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:52,928
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good con because it's not an anime con not a gaming con though It has more good board gaming of the tabletop variety than any con I've ever been to including packs and Maggie.

363
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:54,393
Speaker 0: let's type up the board gaming right.

364
00:24:54,433 --> 00:25:02,558
Speaker 0: so not only is their board game library Astounding pretty much including all the big euro games as well as a lot of like rare older games that are hard to find.

365
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:07,434
Speaker 0: but There's plenty of tables and that's it's not super crowded like Pax's.

366
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:08,679
Speaker 0: you can get a table very easily.

367
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:13,397
Speaker 0: You walk up you take out a game you give them your con badge or your driver's license or whatever.

368
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:22,960
Speaker 0: you get a game you Play it for playing games you get tickets and those tickets can be used to cash in to get stuff sort of like the arcade Where you play skee-ball and then you get a plastic frog, right?

369
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,895
Speaker 0: Only the payout ratios are not ripoffs like the arcade.

370
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:33,300
Speaker 0: like for 10 tickets You can get a $40 board game, which is like unbelievable.

371
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:40,314
Speaker 0: You just got paid with a real board game an expensive one for playing board games And the only money you had to pay was the money you paid to get into the convention.

372
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:55,942
Speaker 0: if you walk out with one board game which you can easily get more than one in like a day of gaming and Assuming you don't do anything else at the con You just got a free badge because basically you bought a board game and like for buying a board game We will let you in the con for free That.

373
00:25:55,962 --> 00:26:04,375
Speaker 0: so if you get two games by playing games for say you could play games say all day Friday all day Sunday and enjoy The rest of the con on Saturday or something like that, you know, see bar fight.

374
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:08,720
Speaker 0: You wouldn't want to miss that And you'd basically get two free board games.

375
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:13,280
Speaker 0: So it's like you get a you buy a board game you get one free and you get a con badge free.

376
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:14,784
Speaker 0: That's a great deal.

377
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,429
Speaker 0: How can you not go to Connecticut?

378
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:17,632
Speaker 1: Yep, July 13 14 15 will be there.

379
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:21,779
Speaker 1: Yeah so laptops.

380
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:24,919
Speaker 1: I got one again about laptop season.

381
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:33,261
Speaker 0: We did a show about this once long long time ago and then we ran out of show ideas in June actually decided 2008.

382
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:41,218
Speaker 1: but You know at the most recent anime Boston packs, my laptop can't really play modern HD video anymore.

383
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:42,943
Speaker 1: It's an old Centrino.

384
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:45,329
Speaker 0: I don't understand this right cuz I had that core solo.

385
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,059
Speaker 0: that core solo can play pretty much any video just got.

386
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,384
Speaker 1: this is Probably slower than that.

387
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:51,809
Speaker 1: It's a centrino.

388
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,460
Speaker 0: the one you have was the model after mine.

389
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's got a centrino and it's still.

390
00:26:57,051 --> 00:27:06,420
Speaker 1: it can play most HD video, but it can't play Certain high-res HD video like if you take a I don't know like a video I export from premiered up to upload to YouTube.

391
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:10,139
Speaker 1: Those that can't play at all because those have a 50 megabit per second, right?

392
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,480
Speaker 1: In fact, even like fairly powerful computers have trouble playing those smoothly.

393
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:19,495
Speaker 1: I only uploaded that way to YouTube because YouTube transcodes them to all the different YouTube standards.

394
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:33,866
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Furthermore certain like anime fan subs are usually fine, but like a blu-ray rip of a movie not gonna play I'm going but mostly based on anime fan subs that I That I would download.

395
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:34,368
Speaker 0: cuz I never really.

396
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:38,139
Speaker 0: and that's not like I'm watching blu-ray rips on that thing You know, but anyway.

397
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,280
Speaker 0: So yeah, so if you're the one who's buying a laptop my laptop is all good.

398
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:48,880
Speaker 1: So it's getting about time to buy a laptop again, but we did this old show on how to buy a laptop.

399
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:51,068
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it seems to be a popular thing, right?

400
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,694
Speaker 0: It seems back in our day.

401
00:27:52,814 --> 00:27:54,520
Speaker 0: Everyone had the desktop computer.

402
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,500
Speaker 0: That was the thing and laptops were like if you had mad moneys you had when I was in high school.

403
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,887
Speaker 1: There's one kid who had a laptop.

404
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:03,299
Speaker 1: It was a 486 laptop and he'd run nesticle on it.

405
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, I think it was a penny him.

406
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:10,043
Speaker 1: It was something I forget it was this was Eighth grade.

407
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,086
Speaker 0: but then there were people.

408
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:15,280
Speaker 0: it started to happen that laptops are just the primary computer and people didn't have desktops.

409
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,095
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of people go that way today.

410
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:20,291
Speaker 1: Yep So when we did that show way back, I mean laptop.

411
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,516
Speaker 1: advice is pretty straightforward.

412
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:22,320
Speaker 1: if you can afford, you know.

413
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:32,779
Speaker 1: basically you choose between size and power and you just pick what's which one of those is more important and When in doubt you might as well go for the extreme of one or the other.

414
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,855
Speaker 1: Yeah but I mean is if it's portable you're gonna use it on a plane.

415
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:36,499
Speaker 1: get a tiny one.

416
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:43,719
Speaker 1: if It's something you put in your checked bags and bring to a place like college Like it's mostly just sitting on your desk, but then you bring it home get a big one.

417
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,876
Speaker 1: There weren't tablets really back then not like we have now.

418
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:50,859
Speaker 1: there weren't even Smartphones to the degree that we have them now.

419
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:59,671
Speaker 1: there weren't even really netbooks to the degree that we have them now and The landscape has changed so much that the advice is kind of different now.

420
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,880
Speaker 1: I think most people don't need laptops.

421
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:03,610
Speaker 0: Well, it depends right?

422
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,620
Speaker 0: I mean if you are Not doing it typing intensive applications, right?

423
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:16,197
Speaker 0: If you just want to like browse the web and look at some files while you're on the go You could probably just get an iPad.

424
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,965
Speaker 0: I Mean what do you need?

425
00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:19,451
Speaker 0: You know, you only need a laptop.

426
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:28,000
Speaker 0: if you need to be able to compute Right, even going to do some sort of work like if you're coding on the go you need a laptop now.

427
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:44,191
Speaker 1: What I think is interesting is that because of this I think It's weird because the MacBook Air came out and then many ultra portable seem to go down that road and try to be Like the MacBook Air like be stupidly thin but yet bigger in every other dimension Thus not any easier to carry around.

428
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:52,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't understand this view but That after that happened then the pads really took off and the tablets and I think there's been a shift from.

429
00:29:52,858 --> 00:30:00,020
Speaker 1: there was a time when Netbooks were super popular because everyone wanted to have a tiny little computer that they could use it like Starbucks or on the go.

430
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:07,368
Speaker 1: you know at a convention have some internet display some stuff and Tablets have mostly destroyed that market.

431
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,153
Speaker 0: because I think well here's what happened.

432
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:16,020
Speaker 1: right the majority of the people who got netbooks Really just wanted the stuff that a tablet does and netbook was just the cheapest way to do that.

433
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,520
Speaker 0: But the reason the netbook was crazy popular.

434
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:25,629
Speaker 0: there were some people who were like man I can have my normal desktop computer and then I can just have a really tiny computer That does almost nothing.

435
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,760
Speaker 0: that's super portable, right?

436
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:37,167
Speaker 0: But most of the people I think who bought netbooks bought them because oh my god It's a computer for like $200 holy shit.

437
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:42,284
Speaker 0: and then they would get them and they would buy a ton of them or you know or one for everyone in Family or who knows right.

438
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:46,300
Speaker 0: and they'd be like, oh these are really crummy and they break and they don't work.

439
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:58,408
Speaker 0: So then they didn't get repeat customers and they didn't last very long at all before they were useless You know, they would physically break or become so slow that they were used, you know, and then Nobody bought them anymore.

440
00:30:58,791 --> 00:30:59,820
Speaker 0: And that was the end of the netbook.

441
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:02,354
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if it's completely dead if you still want one.

442
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:03,078
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can get one.

443
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:15,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I guess that Bunch of factors combined and we're at the point where that market of the ultra portable Ultra little ultra cheap ultra crappy laptop really doesn't have a market.

444
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:20,640
Speaker 0: I think the other thing is right is that most of these people, you know, you buy a powerful computer, right?

445
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,160
Speaker 0: And you're a stupid computer user.

446
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:31,310
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna beat around the bush and you fill it up with malware and other crap because you're dumb and you accidentally Potentially fill it up with junk even if you don't not intentional.

447
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,100
Speaker 1: I mean on my laptop my Fujitsu, you know ultra portable.

448
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:37,842
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of money on in 2008. ish It's actually.

449
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:40,874
Speaker 1: no I reinstalled windows because cruft had built up windows.

450
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:41,717
Speaker 1: Let's cross build.

451
00:31:41,757 --> 00:31:42,620
Speaker 0: I don't have cruft building.

452
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,805
Speaker 1: Oh, I had cruft build up though.

453
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:48,448
Speaker 1: Most of it was actually Fujitsu updates that now that I reinstalled I'd got rid of all that stuff.

454
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:50,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got rid of all the stuff from the get-go.

455
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:54,467
Speaker 0: but anyway if you're the dumb person lets cruft build up.

456
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:59,990
Speaker 0: your stuff gets slower and the computer gets less and less useful and then you can Reinstall to get back to where you were.

457
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,000
Speaker 1: most people don't realize that that's what you do though.

458
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,763
Speaker 0: Well, that's true.

459
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:06,340
Speaker 0: But the thing is you have a netbook that things slow to begin with.

460
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,029
Speaker 0: It's gonna take like a month before you get so slow.

461
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,972
Speaker 0: You can't even use it.

462
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:15,800
Speaker 0: Yep, because you know the powerful computer It's like you can fill it up with more crap before it's useless.

463
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:18,840
Speaker 1: But I mean at this point I like I thought about it.

464
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,472
Speaker 1: Do I really need a laptop much like a long time ago?

465
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:27,400
Speaker 1: I bought a Mac to use as my primary PC because you know PC gaming was dead at the time.

466
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:35,330
Speaker 1: I wasn't really I didn't need a desktop, you know computer in the like I had in the old sense and It was a failure.

467
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:36,079
Speaker 1: It was a mistake.

468
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:46,470
Speaker 1: I went back to using a Linux PC within about a week, but me all that aside I'd really tried to think like do I really need a new laptop or Can I just get by with this old one and or not even need one?

469
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,695
Speaker 1: and it turns out I do.

470
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,847
Speaker 1: I actually need a laptop for a lot of things.

471
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:56,016
Speaker 1: I travel a lot and When I'm using a computer somewhere remote, I'm not surfing the net with it.

472
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:57,060
Speaker 1: I have a smartphone for that.

473
00:32:57,401 --> 00:32:59,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if I'm in the shore, I don't even need to bring a laptop.

474
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:00,500
Speaker 1: I got a smartphone.

475
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:03,580
Speaker 1: What I mean to the shore look at Twitter and then go to the beach, right?

476
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:06,420
Speaker 1: And I have a data plan on the phone.

477
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,620
Speaker 1: I don't need a data plan on my computer anymore because I don't need the data drop that often.

478
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:14,675
Speaker 1: What I need the laptop for is type and shit because I type a lot of stuff.

479
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,283
Speaker 1: I Need a laptop.

480
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:20,529
Speaker 0: you could even get an iPad that you can attach a computer a keyboard to that Yeah, but that's a pain in the ass.

481
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:36,199
Speaker 1: then also I Do video editing and it turns out if I get a new laptop They're actually like the new x230 if I get it with the i7 comparable in power Not counting video card to my desktop PC.

482
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,164
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

483
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:38,229
Speaker 0: is a video card right?

484
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:40,440
Speaker 0: if you did PC gaming did not exist.

485
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:44,891
Speaker 0: I would not even I would not need a desktop computer I would but only for HD video editing.

486
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:46,739
Speaker 1: that is literally the only thing I would need it for right?

487
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,397
Speaker 0: I would just not have a desktop computer and I would just get an even.

488
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:53,860
Speaker 0: you know Maybe I would even get the stupid Mac, but who knows what I would get right?

489
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,498
Speaker 0: But I would just have a laptop only maybe the Lenovo T with a bigger one.

490
00:33:57,518 --> 00:34:01,900
Speaker 0: Yep You know, there's a lot of hardware the normal the normal size one, right?

491
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,947
Speaker 0: and then I could everything I do I could do on there except gaming because you can't get a real video card in a Reasonable laptop.

492
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:19,130
Speaker 0: and if I am getting a big gaming computer I don't want one of those mega Right freaking gaming laptops because the reason you gaming laptop is no good Is that number one.

493
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,060
Speaker 0: it costs more money for less power.

494
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:30,429
Speaker 0: Even if you go all out than a desktop and two you can't detach the monitor from the keyboard So you can't position yourself for gaming properly.

495
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:30,989
Speaker 0: It's no good.

496
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,000
Speaker 0: And if I'm plugging a keyboard into it, why didn't I just get desktop?

497
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,168
Speaker 0: This is you know, it's the.

498
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:41,393
Speaker 0: the whole purpose is stupid and it's also you can't upgrade it like you can a desktop so you got to replace it more often.

499
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:49,376
Speaker 0: gaming laptop is no good, but Regardless if I didn't play games, I would not need a desktop at all.

500
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 0: I would just have a laptop.

501
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:59,693
Speaker 0: But this is the problem We're sort of running into here is you've got this range of devices that are all Computers and all sort of do the same thing in different places.

502
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:00,717
Speaker 0: You got a smartphone.

503
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:02,564
Speaker 0: You got a tablet you got a laptop.

504
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:09,140
Speaker 0: you got you know, a netbook a laptop a desktop an HDPC right all these devices.

505
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:22,854
Speaker 0: But if you have all of them, right then it's like you hardly use any Individual one of them because it's like okay if I'm on the subway Do I use the tablet or the phone if I'm in bed?

506
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:23,657
Speaker 1: Do I use the tablet?

507
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,854
Speaker 1: That's something I've run into in general that my living in the city has.

508
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:31,800
Speaker 1: you know, there's a whole bunch of tangents.

509
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:44,552
Speaker 1: I go off and I want to go on those tangents But living in New York using a subway and or a bicycle to get around all the time Has basically completely changed my computing landscape Like night and day like if I didn't live in a major city.

510
00:35:44,593 --> 00:35:55,705
Speaker 1: a smartphone actually is not that useful to me But a laptop with a data connection will be much more useful because in those, you know, if I live outside of the city I Drive to places.

511
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:59,360
Speaker 1: I don't need to plan meeting up with people ad hoc like I do now.

512
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,660
Speaker 1: I mean now we always have the texting and messaging and Google latitude of hey, we're all gonna meet somewhere for dinner.

513
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,285
Speaker 1: Where do we eat?

514
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,240
Speaker 1: I don't know and we'd literally don't plan at all.

515
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:19,440
Speaker 1: we just wander out of the city and I'll meet up and do stuff like it's not and - I spend a lot of time in the city like Standing outside of a place waiting for other people to show up laptop is useless for that.

516
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:23,840
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna open up a laptop for seven minutes of amusing myself.

517
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:28,099
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go into a Starbucks and by the time I sat down to open the laptop you guys show up.

518
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the phone is perfect for that.

519
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:36,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a question of okay, you know in these different situations I would use these different devices.

520
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:40,340
Speaker 0: Is there should I have all of them or can I not for example?

521
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,400
Speaker 0: I don't have a tablet, you know if I had one I might use it a lion on the couch.

522
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:48,600
Speaker 0: But I have an HTPC there and I could use my laptop on the couch or my phone on the couch.

523
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:49,886
Speaker 1: Yep, so another.

524
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:50,770
Speaker 1: I'm buying a new laptop.

525
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,035
Speaker 1: I have an old laptop.

526
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,022
Speaker 1: that for lying on the couch Just fine.

527
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:56,205
Speaker 0: So why?

528
00:36:56,246 --> 00:37:01,921
Speaker 0: so why spend money on a tablet if I have like three other devices that are already sort of going in Area?

529
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:05,591
Speaker 0: if I'm in bed a tablet is probably more comfortable than the phone or the laptop.

530
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:08,740
Speaker 0: I'm using in bed right now, but why?

531
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,480
Speaker 0: Should buy buy a third device just to be slightly more comfortable in one situation?

532
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:19,978
Speaker 1: Well personally the decision I have made because I you know I could try to do a thing like we did before and like well if you're this kind of person whatever.

533
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:27,359
Speaker 1: but now look at me Businessy dude also, you know podcasting nerd dude goes to a lot of conventions My needs are I need a device.

534
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:33,200
Speaker 1: I mean if you list out all the needs then you can slice it up to figure out how many purpose-built devices you need.

535
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,855
Speaker 1: For example, what do we need?

536
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:35,379
Speaker 1: people like us?

537
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:42,900
Speaker 1: We need something that can play HD video and audio to pretty much any projector in the world at a convention.

538
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:44,225
Speaker 0: That's gotta be a laptop.

539
00:37:44,425 --> 00:37:44,646
Speaker 0: Yep.

540
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:51,255
Speaker 0: No, I mean you can maybe find a tablet that does that but it's everyone I've seen trying to do something like that has failed right?

541
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:52,140
Speaker 0: It's gonna be finicky.

542
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:52,863
Speaker 0: It's gonna be you.

543
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:56,140
Speaker 0: we need something that's super reliable and we need it multiple times a year.

544
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,340
Speaker 1: It has to be a laptop too because it has to be powerful and versatile.

545
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,646
Speaker 1: I mean we did that one packs panel.

546
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,940
Speaker 1: We were playing games live emulated in like maim.

547
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:07,750
Speaker 0: I mean you can't do it with Xbox controllers connected to right?

548
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know good luck getting that to go on some tablet That's running Android or iOS.

549
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:15,560
Speaker 0: Maybe you've got a Windows tablet, but then why don't you just have freaking left?

550
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,264
Speaker 1: I need a device.

551
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:23,584
Speaker 1: I need my connectivity device which is a classic device that didn't exist for me in 2008 But it's my smartphone now.

552
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:25,129
Speaker 1: It's I'm always connected.

553
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:30,087
Speaker 1: anyone who messages me emails me calls me tweets me text me anything I had I always have it.

554
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,119
Speaker 1: I literally leave this in the bathroom when I'm showering.

555
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:34,425
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there's also the.

556
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:37,620
Speaker 0: the smartphone is just um, you can't have not have a smart.

557
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,428
Speaker 0: It's also the iPod music player.

558
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:44,578
Speaker 0: It's also a catcher, you know, my calendar.

559
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:45,360
Speaker 0: It's it's everything.

560
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:46,820
Speaker 1: It's even my wallet for something.

561
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,688
Speaker 0: Yeah And it's so small you can just take it anywhere Even places that you know.

562
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,900
Speaker 0: a small like 8-inch tablet would be prohibited.

563
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,936
Speaker 1: I read a great article talking about how rapidly humans evolved sort of socially or not.

564
00:38:57,976 --> 00:39:00,878
Speaker 1: not evolved in the evolution sense But in a more direct sense.

565
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:05,834
Speaker 1: People who lose a sense like sight or smell or hearing.

566
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:07,980
Speaker 1: there's a specific sort of withdrawal.

567
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,559
Speaker 1: They go through where the brain is like grasping for that sensory input that's not there anymore before it adapts around it.

568
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:20,909
Speaker 1: There's an article showing that if someone has been using a smartphone the way we do for more than some amount of time It's not that long a time.

569
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:31,080
Speaker 1: It was like six months or so That if the smartphone is unavailable You your brain literally reacts in a way that is indistinguishable to someone who has lost their sight or hearing.

570
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,600
Speaker 1: The brain treats it like you have lost a primary sense if your smartphone is not available.

571
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's sort of like when you pick up a hammer to hammer things your brain basically makes that hammer Not like, you know, it's not thinking about your hand.

572
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,431
Speaker 0: It's like the hammer is now a part of your body.

573
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:46,900
Speaker 1: or driving a car, right?

574
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,582
Speaker 1: You know this.

575
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:54,312
Speaker 1: when you're driving like you're actually driving not that we drive that much anymore But your butt kind of gets replaced by your two rear wheels.

576
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:56,420
Speaker 1: like you feel like the car is an extension of you.

577
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,407
Speaker 1: It's not this separate thing.

578
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:58,233
Speaker 1: You're piloting right?

579
00:39:58,253 --> 00:39:59,160
Speaker 0: That's how your brain works.

580
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:04,620
Speaker 0: So, you know if you had a hammer in your hand all the time 24/7

581
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,119
Speaker 1: I'm showering pooping laying in bed the last thing I do every

582
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:15,439
Speaker 0: night It's basically your brain has replaced your hand with the hammer And if you lose the hammer your brain is gonna like whoa.

583
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:26,023
Speaker 1: That's why the one thing I worry about if I get Google Glass, even if it's shitty having it It'll be trouble when I take it off Like big trouble.

584
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:29,114
Speaker 1: I mean look the what's the first thing I do in the morning.

585
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:34,476
Speaker 1: I hear the Uniqlo thing make its noise Because I've been waking up too early.

586
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:37,428
Speaker 1: I Hear it, but the volume was like messed up.

587
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,191
Speaker 1: It was really quiet.

588
00:40:38,211 --> 00:40:40,200
Speaker 1: So I'm laying there and I'm like I hear music.

589
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,420
Speaker 1: Who's playing music?

590
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:44,319
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

591
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,300
Speaker 1: You know when you're in that Twilight where your brain doesn't fully turned on yet?

592
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:50,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you can't figure stuff out.

593
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:52,840
Speaker 1: Like if a phone rings you expect the alarm to be there.

594
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,171
Speaker 1: You're like what the fuck is that?

595
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,280
Speaker 1: I've never heard us.

596
00:40:55,421 --> 00:41:03,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, the first thing I do in the morning is pick up my smartphone Don't even put my glasses on yet and I hold it up to my face and I look at what time it is.

597
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:07,373
Speaker 1: I unlock it and I see if I got any email and I look at Twitter.

598
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:09,080
Speaker 1: Yep, and I read Google News.

599
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:14,363
Speaker 1: The last thing I do before I go to bed is look at my smartphone to make sure the alarm is set Same thing.

600
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:16,978
Speaker 1: and then I plug it into a USB thing and I fall asleep same thing.

601
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:19,965
Speaker 1: That's why the Jane McGonigal game.

602
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:24,903
Speaker 1: I I'm a proponent of it, but at the same time it it's I Feel a lack.

603
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:26,468
Speaker 1: So yeah smartphone.

604
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:28,675
Speaker 1: I don't think of it as what do I need?

605
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,100
Speaker 1: What does the smartphone do instead?

606
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,067
Speaker 1: I think smartphone is given.

607
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:33,813
Speaker 1: What does it already do?

608
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:33,994
Speaker 1: that?

609
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:35,440
Speaker 1: I don't have to do with another device.

610
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:40,040
Speaker 0: So really it's like if you're PC gaming you need a desktop.

611
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:45,420
Speaker 0: Yes No We're on it if you don't have some sort of ultra powerful application that you're working on at home.

612
00:41:46,522 --> 00:41:56,442
Speaker 0: If you don't already have a desktop, you probably don't need one though I would recommend you should be a PC gamer and get a desktop because seriously or in the very least you need home Infrastructure.

613
00:41:56,462 --> 00:41:57,707
Speaker 1: if you're going all laptop.

614
00:41:57,747 --> 00:42:02,927
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're going all laptop, you need to say you need an answer saying in your house You don't have a sand in your house.

615
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,535
Speaker 1: You could we're getting there.

616
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,319
Speaker 0: Where are you gonna put it?

617
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:11,682
Speaker 1: actually You get a NAS in your thinking about that because I got a lot of HD video I was doing.

618
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:14,074
Speaker 0: I was doing pricing and you've got a media center.

619
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:20,015
Speaker 0: You should get an HD V C. Yeah, but you know if you go all laptop you got a laptop and you have a smartphone.

620
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:21,680
Speaker 0: do you need the tablet?

621
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,631
Speaker 0: Well, I think what it comes down to is, you know, maybe you're like grandma.

622
00:42:25,852 --> 00:42:28,038
Speaker 0: grandma probably just needs tablet and nothing else.

623
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:36,160
Speaker 0: tablet it's only and only because Tablet would be easier for grandma to use because you just touched the things to make them go.

624
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:40,820
Speaker 1: Well, I'll say this here's where tablet could fit into my existing workflows of life.

625
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:41,323
Speaker 0: I could just.

626
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:44,220
Speaker 0: I would use it on couch bed and other places where it'd be more.

627
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:49,440
Speaker 1: If I didn't have a Kindle, I would also use a tablet as an e-reader.

628
00:42:49,520 --> 00:43:05,220
Speaker 1: yeah, because one of my primary use cases now is standing on subway platform or train Crowded because it's the four or five and it's rush hour Can't even hold a book with two hands, but I can hold a device in one hand.

629
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:08,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's either a phone or a tablet or a Kindle.

630
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:10,280
Speaker 0: I pads too big for one hand.

631
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:15,360
Speaker 1: Uh, I've seen people do in the one hand you what they had they I. so I've seen multiple people with this.

632
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,114
Speaker 1: It's one of those flip cases that like holds the iPad got a gripper.

633
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:20,865
Speaker 1: when you open it The inside has a gripper.

634
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:22,350
Speaker 1: you stick your hand into like a reverse.

635
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,717
Speaker 0: I'm anti anything like that because it's dorky.

636
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:27,440
Speaker 1: Uh Since when do you care about aesthetics?

637
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:32,168
Speaker 1: Because I have the 100%.

638
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:33,933
Speaker 1: all my devices are naked at all times.

639
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,117
Speaker 1: Otherwise the fuck's the point.

640
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:35,699
Speaker 0: That's right

641
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:50,936
Speaker 1: because Well, no, I should qualify that I am only of the luxury of that because I am wealthy enough to where if I break my Smartphone and it's my fault Not that I've ever done that but if I did I can afford to just buy a new one.

642
00:43:50,977 --> 00:43:58,330
Speaker 1: if I was like when I was RIT and I didn't have any money like I couldn't even afford food if I had a smartphone I would have had some sort of protective case.

643
00:43:58,611 --> 00:43:59,033
Speaker 0: I'm going.

644
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,320
Speaker 0: I'm going further than that, right?

645
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,339
Speaker 0: I see a lot of people with shattered phones even people I know.

646
00:44:04,323 --> 00:44:05,699
Speaker 0: What the fuck did you do?

647
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:14,484
Speaker 1: I've dropped my iPhone 3G and for many times but you dropped your iPod mini to demonstrate to me how Invincible it was.

648
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:19,060
Speaker 1: you and wait, but I did one foot no and poked it with your toe.

649
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,589
Speaker 1: No, the screen is not correct.

650
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:22,612
Speaker 1: That is what happened.

651
00:44:22,652 --> 00:44:23,856
Speaker 1: No, that is not what I was like.

652
00:44:23,876 --> 00:44:24,900
Speaker 1: Scott it don't bring that bike.

653
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:34,990
Speaker 0: Hey, you're like no fine This is what happened and in fact, I will tell you okay I was trying to demonstrate the invincibility of the iPod mini.

654
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:35,892
Speaker 0: you demonstrated.

655
00:44:35,993 --> 00:44:37,357
Speaker 0: it was in a case.

656
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:44,540
Speaker 0: I Dropped it on the floor and then I stomped on it with my heel and the screen broke by stomping.

657
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,500
Speaker 0: I was stomping on the screen with my heel of my foot and it broke.

658
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:56,565
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, I had iPhone 3G and iPhone 4. at first I protected the 3G But that was only for like a few months.

659
00:44:56,886 --> 00:44:58,993
Speaker 1: I had my Motorola Razr the good one.

660
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,097
Speaker 1: Not the shitty Crazer.

661
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:04,352
Speaker 1: I I was drunk and showered with it on me.

662
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:06,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was fine.

663
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:07,528
Speaker 1: I hit the next day.

664
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:12,594
Speaker 0: I called people with it But anyway, I had 3G and a 4. it fell off.

665
00:45:12,615 --> 00:45:13,960
Speaker 0: my 4 has never been protected.

666
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,884
Speaker 0: I've had it for two years.

667
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:15,166
Speaker 0: Now.

668
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,436
Speaker 0: The 3G was only protected for a few months.

669
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:18,280
Speaker 0: It was otherwise naked.

670
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:20,107
Speaker 0: I dropped them both many times.

671
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:23,380
Speaker 0: They have never shattered or broken or had battery problems or anything.

672
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:37,600
Speaker 0: So anyone who has them either it is more confirmation of my magic technology protecting powers or a confirmation bias or These people who have broken it are doing something for example getting drunk and showering with their devices.

673
00:45:38,763 --> 00:45:44,515
Speaker 1: I Dropped that same one in the toilet like four times over the course of the time.

674
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:45,800
Speaker 0: I had protectors are dumb.

675
00:45:46,442 --> 00:45:50,400
Speaker 0: You only need a protector if you need to protect it from yourself if you need to protect it from yourself.

676
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:54,479
Speaker 1: Well, actually I am thinking about getting a protector, but I won't use this protector all the time.

677
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:57,227
Speaker 1: This is this protector is waterproof protect.

678
00:45:57,247 --> 00:46:01,999
Speaker 1: Yes or yon beach for yon beach and rock climbing slash mountain climbing.

679
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,600
Speaker 0: because well No for that you want a device a thing that lets you tether it to yourself.

680
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:08,828
Speaker 0: So if you drop it off a mountain, it's just sort of hanging on.

681
00:46:08,848 --> 00:46:16,171
Speaker 0: what I want is because when I went in the Adirondacks It doesn't go tick tick All the way down the mountain tick.

682
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:25,188
Speaker 1: Oh my god I did draw my phone skiing once and it's this phone with this convex landed like this and started just sled it down Like I was chasing it.

683
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,352
Speaker 1: It was going faster than me.

684
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:27,115
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

685
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:29,779
Speaker 0: You should make a ski That's shaped like the bottom of that phone.

686
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,172
Speaker 1: You know skis are kind of shaped like the bottom of this phone actually.

687
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:33,955
Speaker 0: No, man.

688
00:46:33,996 --> 00:46:34,377
Speaker 0: There you go.

689
00:46:34,578 --> 00:46:38,452
Speaker 1: Yeah But where was I going with this right?

690
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:44,880
Speaker 1: so we went up mountain climbing right Through torrential pouring rain like I was walking down a waterfall at one point.

691
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:50,340
Speaker 1: Everyone but me brought their fucking smartphones with them in like multiple ziplock bags.

692
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:57,706
Speaker 1: Every one of those smartphones was fucked really because the ziplock bags filled up with water ziplock But they didn't fill up but enough moisture got in.

693
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:58,608
Speaker 0: Yeah.

694
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:02,480
Speaker 1: Yeah a little secret guys one ziplock bag not enough.

695
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:05,857
Speaker 1: No kidding two ziplock bags barely enough.

696
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:12,895
Speaker 1: But I'm thinking about getting a like hard case that also is a like arm straps.

697
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,459
Speaker 1: I can strap the smartphone to my.

698
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,160
Speaker 0: I mean That's a special purpose thing, right?

699
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:23,868
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with say having the thing that lets you tie your iPhone to your arm for running or the one to mount it To the bike like that on shoes.

700
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:27,100
Speaker 1: We're like, it's one thing to have a hundred pair of slight crook slightly.

701
00:47:27,863 --> 00:47:30,291
Speaker 0: So fashion shoes, yeah, I have the same.

702
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:32,940
Speaker 0: I have ten Nike sneakers in ten different colors.

703
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,522
Speaker 1: But now I got.

704
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:34,546
Speaker 1: let's see skis.

705
00:47:34,787 --> 00:47:39,907
Speaker 1: Well ski boots are rollerblades running shoes Exactly shoes climbing shoes.

706
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:40,870
Speaker 0: It's a snow boots.

707
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:43,520
Speaker 0: The default phone protector is naked.

708
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,520
Speaker 0: The default protector is always naked.

709
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,688
Speaker 1: The thing is what really gets me is the Kindle like?

710
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,856
Speaker 1: the Kindle is the main reason I don't get a pad.

711
00:47:49,956 --> 00:47:55,365
Speaker 1: because I love Irritators I like after a month of using that thing Fuck paper books.

712
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:57,433
Speaker 1: I'd like now when I have to open a paper book.

713
00:47:57,453 --> 00:48:00,960
Speaker 0: I'm like, ah my god I still like a paper book.

714
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,080
Speaker 0: But the Kindle is the first e-reader that I can actually kind of use.

715
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,499
Speaker 1: The only thing is I won't use the the Kindle on the beach.

716
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:11,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I got to bring a physical book to the beach.

717
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,200
Speaker 0: So I think my bad luck with that, too.

718
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,108
Speaker 0: I've had books get so wet on the beach.

719
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:17,759
Speaker 1: I only bring books I bought at the beach.

720
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:19,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, the beach.

721
00:48:19,223 --> 00:48:19,745
Speaker 0: and then I got.

722
00:48:19,886 --> 00:48:23,060
Speaker 0: I remember one time I bought a book at the beach and then I left it out.

723
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:24,991
Speaker 1: Oh, you left it outside overnight.

724
00:48:25,011 --> 00:48:26,400
Speaker 0: I left it outside overnight.

725
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:33,469
Speaker 0: But dude The thing is I the worst part about it was I saw the book out there on the stoop and I knew that it was Out in the stoop and you were like, I will be fine.

726
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:35,379
Speaker 0: No, I thought it was someone else's book.

727
00:48:37,544 --> 00:48:40,573
Speaker 0: Right, and I was like, oh someone else leaving their book outside whatever.

728
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:46,609
Speaker 0: it doesn't bother me and I'm God if there was ever Karma in the world And I still haven't finished reading.

729
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:48,080
Speaker 0: it was kidnapped by Stevenson.

730
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:50,066
Speaker 0: I haven't finished reading that.

731
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:55,703
Speaker 1: but basically look I need I need a device that I can read books on and I have a Specific.

732
00:48:55,783 --> 00:48:57,150
Speaker 1: it's a device that only does that.

733
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,260
Speaker 1: I got the non touchscreen Kindle.

734
00:49:00,382 --> 00:49:04,520
Speaker 1: The cool thing about it is it fits in my pocket like for real naked.

735
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,811
Speaker 1: But if it was in a case it wouldn't fits in a big pocket.

736
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,885
Speaker 1: it fits in all my blazer pockets But you can't like.

737
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:10,608
Speaker 0: that's a big buck.

738
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,833
Speaker 0: You can't sit on it though.

739
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:12,375
Speaker 0: It doesn't bend.

740
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:13,580
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but it'll fit.

741
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,960
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, it's like you can get it in the pocket and you can walk around But it's like it's a little big in there and then you can't sit with it.

742
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,377
Speaker 1: But if you're wearing a jacket like a blazer or a suit, it just fits in the pocket.

743
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:26,545
Speaker 0: I mean a Giant gun will fit in there.

744
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:27,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, sort of the point.

745
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:30,216
Speaker 1: so that covers e-reading my phone covers.

746
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:33,366
Speaker 1: pretty much all Want to connect to things when I'm not home.

747
00:49:33,928 --> 00:49:42,513
Speaker 1: So the only things I need a laptop for are showing video and audio conventions Editing HD video while I'm at said conventions, so I don't forget about it.

748
00:49:42,594 --> 00:49:52,039
Speaker 1: and you know put up a video from packs Just in time for the next packs And recording audio from a firewire thing live at an event.

749
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:54,508
Speaker 1: So I need a super powerful laptop.

750
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:57,600
Speaker 0: the things I need my laptop for our conventions, of course, right?

751
00:49:58,201 --> 00:50:04,497
Speaker 0: Yep, doing computing for real like in the bedroom just cuz I don't want to get up and head on Saturday morning But maybe I could do some work.

752
00:50:05,221 --> 00:50:08,960
Speaker 0: Sometimes you need to do something that involves multiple computers, especially developing.

753
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got to get more computers going on in the house just to you know Network stuff or who knows what.

754
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:14,809
Speaker 1: yeah, I never have to.

755
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:16,435
Speaker 0: sometimes I had to bring a computer.

756
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,640
Speaker 0: that like moves, right?

757
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,320
Speaker 0: For example, I want to plug a real computer into say my Apple to GS.

758
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,418
Speaker 0: Well, I can't bring my desktop over there and the Apple to GS is big and heavy And maybe I don't want to bring that over near the desk, you know stuff like that.

759
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:35,640
Speaker 0: And also when you go to events in the city like hacker events, you got to bring a laptop, right?

760
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,326
Speaker 0: I can't bring my desktop there to do right.

761
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:41,300
Speaker 0: so I need a portable thing that can also do coding work.

762
00:50:41,802 --> 00:50:45,715
Speaker 1: Laptop is the only thing I'm looking at this one because it's powerful enough.

763
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,040
Speaker 1: I mean, there's no video card.

764
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:55,240
Speaker 1: it'll it won't play games effectively, but It'll do some of that stuff well enough like I'll be able to play Civ 5 on it if I want.

765
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:02,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I didn't need to do this work on the go, I could probably just have the iPad instead or something like that I don't know.

766
00:51:02,703 --> 00:51:03,707
Speaker 1: So I have all these use cases.

767
00:51:03,747 --> 00:51:06,660
Speaker 1: So I need a very portable very high-powered laptop.

768
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:07,956
Speaker 1: So again, I need an ultra book.

769
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:09,787
Speaker 1: There aren't that?

770
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,740
Speaker 1: I mean there's still a lot of ultra books.

771
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:14,330
Speaker 0: I'm surprised but I think there's more than there used to be.

772
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:28,752
Speaker 0: but they're different than they used to be because now they used to Be right more like the Lenovo X that I have which is we'll make a laptop We're gonna just make it a smaller screen size like 12 13 inches But at the same time we're gonna pack a lot of horsepower into there.

773
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:37,079
Speaker 0: lots of RAM lots of CPU lots of everything Everything but video card and an SSD makes you third is gonna have 8 gigs of RAM and an i7.

774
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:39,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and an SSD.

775
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:41,859
Speaker 1: It's actually almost better than my desktop except for the video card.

776
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:49,720
Speaker 0: But what's happened now is the MacBook Air right is sort of like ultra book, but it's sort of netbook, right?

777
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:57,880
Speaker 0: I view it as like extra small netbook But it's slightly more like reliable and it's not just gonna like die on you like a netbook.

778
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:06,308
Speaker 0: It's actually gonna last and it does normal computing work, you know, I could almost use it if it ran windows With the air's and all that stuff.

779
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:13,600
Speaker 1: a laptop that is big in Horizontal, you know in two dimensions and super thin and the third one is not useful to me.

780
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:16,783
Speaker 1: I need something I can carry in a tiny bag Exactly.

781
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,590
Speaker 0: That's why I mean the MacBook Air isn't.

782
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:22,646
Speaker 0: that bit is very very small in all the dimensions It is but it's like they.

783
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:30,120
Speaker 0: you know, the thinness is impressive, you know, but at the same time It's like how much does that thinness really affect me, right?

784
00:52:30,602 --> 00:52:34,300
Speaker 0: I'm you know, it affects me more having having to carry a whole another weight.

785
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:35,950
Speaker 0: The air is also way less.

786
00:52:36,192 --> 00:52:37,400
Speaker 0: is that I need it for the air?

787
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:50,213
Speaker 0: You need like a zillion adapters on it to get all these connectors and thingies that you need to do work whereas the Lenovo X just has freaking as USBs all over the place and a VGA and Ethernet even as a dial-up modem daddy

788
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:53,341
Speaker 1: to USB 3 and one always powered USB 2.

789
00:52:53,341 --> 00:52:55,540
Speaker 0: Right, it's got headphone hole microphone hole.

790
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:00,543
Speaker 0: I got all these holes removable batteries all these things that allow me to get work done Right.

791
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:08,156
Speaker 0: and and for you know, the price of that is an extra centimeter or two of thickness But it's really not any bigger than there any other dimensions.

792
00:53:08,236 --> 00:53:15,520
Speaker 1: so much And as a real chicken keyboard, you know, I was kind of sold on the x230 because the x220 was so great.

793
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:17,960
Speaker 1: But you know, I got to my due diligence.

794
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:19,025
Speaker 1: I did a whole bunch of research.

795
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:28,711
Speaker 1: all the other similar ultra portable ultra book kind of things I found were a thousand dollars more Slightly smaller not any more powerful.

796
00:53:28,731 --> 00:53:29,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, they kept the altar.

797
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:31,160
Speaker 0: Everyone's trying to copy the MacBook.

798
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,460
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna be another thousand dollars to save like two millimeters in one dimension.

799
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:37,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's just copying the air.

800
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:41,287
Speaker 1: because they also seriously, you know I love my Fujitsu life book.

801
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:58,030
Speaker 1: like that Fujitsu makes really great like boutique ultra books but Fujitsu support really fucking sucks like Really hard to get any sort of drivers or help and like they'd had the shock sensor thing that you know Protects the hard drive.

802
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,362
Speaker 0: You don't need that if you have an SSD I know.

803
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:08,350
Speaker 1: but yeah that stopped working as soon as I installed service pack one of Vista And I went to Fujitsu, but I can't wait to support that.

804
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:21,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just like Those sort of like non Big name in America laptops seem to be cooked slightly So in weird ways that just cause problems.

805
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:24,120
Speaker 0: that is one thing that's very annoying right when you build a desktop, right?

806
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,855
Speaker 1: I get like art, you know a bit.

807
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:31,820
Speaker 0: or aces Chipset though you build it on your own which means you install clean windows or clean Linux on it.

808
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,107
Speaker 1: Oh, you're going that road, right?

809
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,440
Speaker 0: If you no one buys a desktop that's already put together.

810
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:36,723
Speaker 1: People do.

811
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:39,840
Speaker 0: but if you buy a laptop, you can't really buy a blank one.

812
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,664
Speaker 0: I mean you can.

813
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:46,054
Speaker 0: there are companies that sell like awesome Linux laptops and stuff like that But their hardware is so bad.

814
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:46,959
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

815
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:48,247
Speaker 1: Now the only way to do it.

816
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:50,620
Speaker 1: you can't get a clean install disk either.

817
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,640
Speaker 1: They either give you a restore partition or like a DVD that reinstalls all the bullshit.

818
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,446
Speaker 0: Yeah If you buy it see buy a laptop that's already put together that has a bunch of bullshit on it at least Lenovo at least the one I had.

819
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:07,009
Speaker 0: you could go on and uninstall all their bullshit through the you know Uninstalled programs menu and it would work.

820
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:09,778
Speaker 0: You just had to uninstall all their stuff and then it would be clean windows.

821
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,160
Speaker 0: Tada But otherwise you got to get a Windows disk from somewhere.

822
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:22,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, but without you know with you get the key and everything, but they're not gonna give you the disk and legally technically contract Whatever, you'd have to buy a new life.

823
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:26,120
Speaker 0: Somebody was saying that if you buy a Dell, I don't know how true this is.

824
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,506
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna tell laughter.

825
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:36,315
Speaker 0: I have somebody said if you buy a Dell or maybe certain Dell I don't know and you click the right thing when you're checking out They'll send you the disk and the disk is a real Windows disk.

826
00:55:36,557 --> 00:55:37,039
Speaker 0: That's blank.

827
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:40,000
Speaker 0: Someone said that I don't know if it's true or not.

828
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:44,117
Speaker 1: I would pay like 20 bucks more just for you to not give me your Norton bullshit.

829
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:44,720
Speaker 1: I don't want it.

830
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:46,690
Speaker 0: I don't know why they give this bullshit.

831
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,052
Speaker 1: Why do they?

832
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:48,680
Speaker 1: I guess Norton and all those people pay them?

833
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:51,860
Speaker 0: It's well, I mean I can understand Norton right paying them to do something, right?

834
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,803
Speaker 0: But take this for example.

835
00:55:52,823 --> 00:55:56,373
Speaker 0: you buy Lenovo and in that in the taskbar, there's another.

836
00:55:56,393 --> 00:55:58,480
Speaker 0: this is Intel Wi-Fi manager, right?

837
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,671
Speaker 0: Intel or Lenovo, what do they gain by having that there?

838
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:03,216
Speaker 0: Windows already has a Wi-Fi man.

839
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:04,120
Speaker 0: It works fine.

840
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,456
Speaker 0: Why do they have this other Wi-Fi manager in there?

841
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,726
Speaker 0: that's ugly I could see and is worse.

842
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:19,339
Speaker 0: if it let you use some special features of the hardware that weren't standard Why don't you just make a normal Windows driver that exposes those so that the Windows Wi-Fi thing can take advantage of that?

843
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,152
Speaker 1: Nope, but well, I was gonna make it even more rude.

844
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:23,360
Speaker 0: quite a standard Windows.

845
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:26,828
Speaker 1: No one uses those things anyway Like in the x230 you can get.

846
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:32,415
Speaker 1: now it's free to get the regular Intel Chipset for the Wi-Fi instead of when you get it.

847
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,420
Speaker 0: There's gonna be this bullshit.

848
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:37,093
Speaker 1: Hardware wise you can get the Lenovo one or the Intel one.

849
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:43,866
Speaker 1: you can pick for free which one yeah or you can pay like 50 bucks to get the Intel like special one.

850
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:46,414
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell it doesn't that?

851
00:56:46,454 --> 00:56:48,099
Speaker 0: no I thought that has 3g if you buy that.

852
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,554
Speaker 1: no No, the 3g stuff is completely separate from that.

853
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:56,840
Speaker 1: Oh, okay There's a lot of like special hardware and software for Wi-Fi.

854
00:56:57,021 --> 00:57:01,300
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell it's not used by any actual environment anywhere in the world.

855
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:08,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see all these things like hey, it's double Wi-Fi like you know It's not next twice and you get double bandwidth because it's like you're connecting with two.

856
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:10,840
Speaker 1: I defy you to get your router to support.

857
00:57:11,121 --> 00:57:16,017
Speaker 0: Nothing will do that unless you buy like a set of hardware and then it'll work once and never work again.

858
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:17,020
Speaker 0: It's bullshit.

859
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:21,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I did all my research.

860
00:57:21,074 --> 00:57:22,100

Speaker 0: See tablets actually really good for a kitchen PC.

865
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:45,077
Speaker 0: Nah Maybe right because then you if it was mounted if it was mounted on the wall like I'd not because the even if you cry cuz it's a tablet you can just wipe it off.

866
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:48,480
Speaker 0: if you get the Keyboard going on in there stuff can get in there in the kitchen.

867
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,089
Speaker 1: Well, what I would do is all get dirty.

00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:52,000
Speaker 0: you touch some eggs and then you touch the keyboard.

869
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:56,100

875
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:13,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, and is it worth the money?

876
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:19,160
