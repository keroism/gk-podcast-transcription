73
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,979
Speaker 0: What phones do the big ups have?

74
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:52,884
Speaker 1: I actually don't know.

Speaker 1: but but they asked me what phone I had because they were gonna give me a company phone and it felt Like the Nexus and everyone's like, oh you don't need our phone.

76
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,947
Speaker 0: Okay, dude What computers do they have on their desk?

77
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:03,292

00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:17,055
Speaker 1: the first computer they gave me before I got the Windows box was just Ubuntu.

83
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,964
Speaker 0: Okay, they took There's already an Ubuntu in the house.

84
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good sign.

85
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,860
Speaker 0: Okay question number three is the most important.

86
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,525
Speaker 0: Uh-oh, what kind of bikes are they riding?

87
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,953

Speaker 0: Okay, okay That's a very CEO.

90
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:37,720
Speaker 1: the thing is they know real bikes and they're all super athletic which counts for a lot actually.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,931
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the question, you know if it was?

92
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,884
Speaker 1: I'm tired of working with Eunuch Santas much.

93
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:42,887
Speaker 1: I love Eunuch Santas.

94
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,433
Speaker 1: I like people I can play paintball with.

95
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:47,890
Speaker 0: the thing is in the ideal company All right has to have both.

96
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,300
Speaker 0: you have to have the Eunuch Santa.

97
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:55,839
Speaker 0: Ah, you don't think you can learn if there's nothing if there's no Eunuch in your job If there's no Eunuch, then you got another problem.

98
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:58,628
Speaker 1: Here's the weirdest thing.

99
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:05,580
Speaker 1: this is the first time in my life I have had a job where my job does not in any way involve straight-up support.

100
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,868
Speaker 0: But I mean your company uses Eunuch's machines.

101
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:09,093
Speaker 0: They're all your servers.

102
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,080
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, there's stuff but I don't have to manage that.

103
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,130
Speaker 1: I'm actually kind of divorced from that.

104
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,060
Speaker 1: let like operational tech, right?

105
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:27,409
Speaker 0: but the point is You got to have Eunuch Santas and Steve Jobs is combined right because while lately I'm been a lot of you know a lot of my rants and Technical opinions have been very anti jobs.

106
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:30,620
Speaker 0: You got to remember that the jobs is also necessary.

107
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,390
Speaker 1: Well, let's put it this way the jobs made for whatever you feel about Apple some of the best goddamn user interfaces The world has ever seen.

108
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:38,520
Speaker 0: Yes, um, not.

109
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:40,988
Speaker 0: But look, you know.

110
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:47,680
Speaker 0: take for example my favorite example I always bring up in this discussion is the Apple to GS the most beautiful computer ever created.

111
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,063
Speaker 1: That's Eunuch Santa.

112
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:51,249
Speaker 0: Why was the Apple to GS created?

113
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,540
Speaker 0: is because it was a combination of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs.

114
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,155
Speaker 0: God, we just had the Wozniak.

115
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:03,114
Speaker 0: without the jobs The Apple to GS would have been like all sorts of wicked ugly.

116
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,020
Speaker 0: if you just had the jobs You wouldn't have been able to open it.

117
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,484
Speaker 0: It would have been welded shut right.

118
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:15,309
Speaker 0: but because you had both you had this perfect computer that opened up just once and it was Completely flat and all the slots were in a row.

119
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,954
Speaker 0: It was the ultimate combination.

120
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a third way.

121
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:19,470
Speaker 1: There's a third way.

122
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,740
Speaker 1: There's actually a triangle Eunuch Santa Steve Jobs and the other direction is Tim Berners-Lee.

123
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:34,842
Speaker 1: idealized software solutions Functional Requirements with no interface or thought for practicality Right.

124
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:38,193
Speaker 0: So speaking of Steve Jobs, right you you got a new HDVC.

125
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:39,016
Speaker 1: I did.

126
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,120
Speaker 1: I have not that exciting.

127
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,370
Speaker 1: I've not plugged it into my TV yet just cuz I've been busy.

128
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,736
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's.

129
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:44,680
Speaker 0: it works though, right?

130
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what my whole life.

131
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,536
Speaker 1: ever since I switched away from AMD I got to say I've never had a failure to post on the first boot.

132
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:57,560
Speaker 1: In fact, I Closed the case and put all the screws in before I turned it on for the first time.

133
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,931
Speaker 1: That is how fucking confident I was and it were.

134
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,760
Speaker 0: you were right, dude, my old AMD boxes.

135
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,760
Speaker 1: I would like plug power into the motherboard with CPU and RAM sitting on the floor and turn it on to make sure it worked.

136
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,285
Speaker 0: Can't go wrong with Nvidia Intel.

137
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:13,260
Speaker 0: Anyway, the so you didn't need the Mac Mini anymore now.

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,830
Speaker 0: So I said hey Mac Mini you have been you.

139
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,195
Speaker 0: you have served your many years.

140
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,380
Speaker 0: It's actually many years old.

141
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,427
Speaker 1: It was like it was a core solo.

142
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:20,968
Speaker 1: is the you?

143
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:24,299
Speaker 0: do you remember that you originally bought it to replace my normal PC?

144
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,780
Speaker 0: He uses your normal PC and it was in the earliest days of gig night.

145
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,966
Speaker 1: You may remember an episode that was me bitching for an hour because I unplugged my old computer Which was my old RIT computer.

146
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,371
Speaker 1: It was like a Thunderbird giga.

147
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,535
Speaker 0: So this was probably in 2005 six.

148
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:40,823
Speaker 0: I remember.

149
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:45,280
Speaker 1: there's a picture of me sitting there like holding it up like amazed at how tiny it is and I install it.

150
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,603
Speaker 1: I think was actually six seven, but I set it up and I'm like It still had that old 19 inch CRT.

151
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:54,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was so shiny and so nice.

152
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:00,411
Speaker 1: and then I opened up Garage band and I was like, let's podcast.

153
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:06,780
Speaker 1: and then four hours later I had plugged my old PC back in it wouldn't boot because it was broken.

154
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:10,720
Speaker 1: That's the reason I replaced it and I redid an entire episode from scratch.

155
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,940
Speaker 1: There was me bitching about how much I hate the Mac, right?

156
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,184
Speaker 0: So this Mac mini?

157
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,632
Speaker 0: I said well you have lived out your years.

158
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,959
Speaker 0: if we threw you out or just gate sold you or gave You away, that would not be bad.

159
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,280
Speaker 0: But you still work and you're a Mac.

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,286
Speaker 0: You're the only Mac I have.

161
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,780
Speaker 0: that's not a work computer that I can't use for personal things.

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,324
Speaker 1: I have some trouble with the optical drive.

163
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:31,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I brought it home - I said why not?

164
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,551
Speaker 0: I'll try some Development of iPhone app.

165
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,780
Speaker 0: I'll make the simplest iPhone app.

166
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,270
Speaker 0: That's like just a fucking button or something.

167
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,780
Speaker 0: do the thing just to make an iPhone.

168
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,778
Speaker 1: You notice how that the Apple logo at the top like that's plastic is slightly yellowed.

169
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:51,351
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah so anyway I brought a home and I really wanted to reinstall the snow leopard to get it back for it to nothing and I couldn't because the optical drive was busted which I remembered.

170
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,040
Speaker 1: It's okay the watch out.

171
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,720
Speaker 0: We switched it to region - you'll have to it doesn't matter because I'm not even gonna use the optical drive.

172
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:03,760
Speaker 0: I went and I used my work Mac to create a snow leopard bootable USB stick which race which worked.

173
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,300
Speaker 0: Amazingly if you search on Google for directions, it'll tell you how it worked perfectly.

174
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,326
Speaker 0: So I reinstall the snow leopard from the USB stick.

175
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:11,069
Speaker 0: beautiful.

176
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,640
Speaker 0: Then I said, well, let me get the X code.

177
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,567
Speaker 0: So there's a free X code in the App Store.

178
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,475
Speaker 0: X code 4.1 is the newest one.

179
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:19,840
Speaker 0: you need lion.

180
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,128
Speaker 0: Alrighty, what's only 30 bucks?

181
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,513
Speaker 0: Who gives a shit?

182
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,080
Speaker 0: I'll buy your stupid lion.

183
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:28,170
Speaker 0: You cannot install lion.

184
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,613
Speaker 0: You have a core solo, ha That's so sad which is not 64 bits.

185
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:34,719
Speaker 1: that's so sad.

186
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:37,928
Speaker 0: Well, then let me go get X code.

187
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:41,940
Speaker 0: cuz you remember there was X code 3 point something which is on the snow leopard disc.

188
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,526
Speaker 0: So I could have just installed that easily.

189
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:51,520
Speaker 0: but before they came up with X code 4.1 There was X code 4.0 Which is the one that they were charging like $10 for in the App Store.

190
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,580
Speaker 0: Remember that when everyone was like, oh they're charging for X code 10 bucks now, it's free again.

191
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,712
Speaker 0: Well, I said well, let me go get that one that they were charging 10 bucks for.

192
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:00,680
Speaker 0: right, but it wasn't in the App Store.

193
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,320
Speaker 0: So I went to the Apple developer site and it wasn't there.

194
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,459
Speaker 0: The only ones they had were 4.1 which which is the one you need lion for and three point something Which is the one I already had on the USB stick.

195
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,586
Speaker 0: So I'm like what happened to 4.0 point whatever.

196
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:18,840
Speaker 0: you need to pay $100 to be in the iOS developer program to get that.

197
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:24,130
Speaker 0: oh my god, and The Iowa you can't even if you you can make.

198
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,440
Speaker 0: if you had lion you could make all the iPhone apps you wanted.

199
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:31,419
Speaker 0: You can't load them onto your iPhone unless you pay the hundred dollars.

200
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,661
Speaker 0: Submit them to the App Store unless you pay $100.

201
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,548
Speaker 1: That sounds about right.

202
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,060
Speaker 0: you can only run them in a little emulator.

203
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:40,898
Speaker 0: And by the way that hundred dollars is a hundred dollars a year not a hundred dollars.

204
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,996
Speaker 0: once It's a hundred dollars a year to be an iOS develop still gonna be an iOS developer.

205
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:45,618
Speaker 0: Fuck.

206
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:55,062
Speaker 0: No Given that Mac mini to the parents to use as an HTTP C and to sync their iPods because right now I watch out It won't full-screen 1080p.

207
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:59,240
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter that my parents they can't even watch Netflix on their TV right now.

208
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,975
Speaker 1: Do you think they're gonna be okay with control zooming in to YouTube videos like we were?

209
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,560
Speaker 0: they're not gonna watch YouTube videos.

210
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,408
Speaker 0: They're just gonna use like boxy and watch.

211
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:08,493
Speaker 0: we're lucky if they watch.

212
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,180
Speaker 0: use boxy to watch a Netflix.

213
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:12,991
Speaker 0: All right, that'll be a huge improvement over what they're doing now.

214
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,000
Speaker 1: boxy didn't even work so well on that thing.

215
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,760
Speaker 0: It's better than what they have now at the very least, right?

216
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:29,740
Speaker 0: They don't even have like a. they only have like a Ubuntu on a Dell laptop that they use for everything and all they really do Is use Firefox which is just fine for them, but they have iPods that they can't sync.

217
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,457
Speaker 0: So the very least they can just use it for iTunes and nothing else, which it can definitely do.

218
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:36,452
Speaker 0: Yeah On snow leopard.

219
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,607
Speaker 1: I think in the long run It should probably replace the like.

220
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:42,003
Speaker 1: I don't put it somewhere in their house is like a little PC somewhere I don't know.

221
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,598
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'll just give it to them because now it's useless for me.

222
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,779
Speaker 0: But the thing is I have to go and buy them the little Mac keyboard that goes with it?

223
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,185
Speaker 1: No, yeah, cuz I kept that one.

224
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:56,505
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I like the boxy remote, but since I need a mouse anyway When I'm not in boxy.

225
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been using boxy more though.

226
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,260
Speaker 0: I've got hooked up to pretty much all the video files.

227
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,847
Speaker 0: So yeah, I don't want to watch any.

228
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:08,199
Speaker 0: the only time I don't use boxy is pretty much to go to College Humor.

229
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,680
Speaker 0: Yep, I got a massacre.

230
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:14,200
Speaker 1: I got to see what it would take to set up like a boxy app thing that would just do College Humor you want to.

231
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,771
Speaker 0: There is a College Humor boxy app, but it only watches College Humor originals.

232
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,820
Speaker 0: It doesn't do all the videos in college humor.

233
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,563
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

234
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:25,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can write a boxy app in Python if you want.

235
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,520
Speaker 1: really that's what I was about to ask.

236
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:27,444
Speaker 1: What does it take?

237
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:28,449
Speaker 1: is it easy to do that?

238
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,980
Speaker 0: Because yeah, there's just there's instructions on the boxy website.

239
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,227
Speaker 0: You can just write boxy apps.

240
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:37,748
Speaker 0: It's actually not that hard duly noted You know, you could definitely do it.

241
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:47,700
Speaker 1: your code might be ugly, but you could definitely write a boxy app Because I need a Python project and while I like a web stuff and like I was playing with Django and I really like flask.

242
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,525
Speaker 1: I was playing with that.

243
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:49,310
Speaker 1: That's really fun.

244
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,020
Speaker 0: Actually flask is a lot simpler.

245
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:56,280
Speaker 0: It's well, it's really fun because if I want but the thing is what's gonna happen is you I've used flask a bunch also.

246
00:12:56,488 --> 00:13:07,080
Speaker 0: Yeah You start using it like we and then you want to do something like logging in and it's like you can write a login authentication thing or Django has authentication.

247
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:15,900
Speaker 1: So What I would use flask for in my professional life in the like operations is something like making a little status page of stuff.

248
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,787
Speaker 0: Absolutely Perfect use of flask.

249
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,939
Speaker 1: Yep, like see what's running on the PC.

250
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,300
Speaker 1: You see anything like that, but it's just fun too.

251
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,040
Speaker 0: Cuz you know you just got to make sure you put the Apache in the WSGI in front of it properly.

252
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:28,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll do that.

253
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can show you how to do that.

254
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:31,460
Speaker 1: I learned how to do that.

255
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:38,340
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz I had a lot of free time Because that way you can get things like the Apache offs and but as much no, you know.

256
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,630
Speaker 0: Oh, that's something I gotta tell you.

257
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,899
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go into this very long.

258
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:45,334
Speaker 0: You know the Apache configs is always like allow deny allow from all all that business.

259
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:45,475
Speaker 0: Yeah.

260
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mastered that really Yep, it's not that hard.

261
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:49,952
Speaker 0: I've completely mastered all that.

262
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,920
Speaker 0: I finally know what it all means and can do it perfectly.

263
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,227
Speaker 1: Can you here's here's the love this is.

264
00:13:54,247 --> 00:14:05,760
Speaker 1: this is if you're like a four out of ten in terms of guru mastery of Apache Do you know how to pretty much drop in make Apache authenticate against an active directory like a Windows one?

265
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:06,990
Speaker 0: I already saw the instructions.

266
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:07,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, have you ever done it?

267
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,284
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

268
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:10,150
Speaker 0: No, but I could.

269
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,480
Speaker 0: if I had to do it I could do it in a day.

270
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:14,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I did it but it didn't work with Twiki.

271
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:24,760
Speaker 0: and then I gave up what I did Actually at work as I made it so that if you visit a page a site On a virtual host actually it gives you basic off which is you know username password against an HD pass.

272
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're coming from a certain IP No basic off you just get right in.

273
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,514
Speaker 0: so if you're in the office you can just visit the page But if you're outside the office, you got to log in to get.

274
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,320
Speaker 1: I did the same thing.

275
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,420
Speaker 1: I had a thing that would control some fixed sessions on this like fixed gateway.

276
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:41,157
Speaker 1: I wrote right and it had a little like web page in it that would like.

277
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:46,620
Speaker 1: you could like turn Sessions on and off and whatever and I didn't want to put off into it because I didn't care, right?

278
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,900
Speaker 0: So anyway, the long day end of this opening bit is fuck you Steve Jobs.

279
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,366
Speaker 0: You want people to make iOS apps?

280
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:54,460
Speaker 0: You should let people develop them on Windows or whatever.

281
00:14:54,902 --> 00:15:06,013
Speaker 0: I might try this phone gap thing which came out with 1.0 today, which lets you make an app in HTML CSS and JavaScript that will then work on Android iPhone Windows phone and fucking everything.

282
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm gonna try that out.

283
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,259
Speaker 1: I thought oh we should make a nice app and I was like what the fuck would it do?

284
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:11,445
Speaker 0: Nothing.

285
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:19,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want a geek nights app What you can do is you can use your Twitter and soon your Facebook app on whatever device you have and just go to Us in Twitter or Facebook.

286
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,671
Speaker 0: That's basically the equivalent of the app.

287
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:26,037
Speaker 0: is you'll get all the notifications about all our new shit Yep, and our I'll save for the meta.

288
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,947
Speaker 0: I got some Com in your mobile browsing.

289
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:34,120
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some tech because there was a. I had some other news I wanted to talk about but I noticed this article today.

290
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:39,680
Speaker 1: It's funny having a job where it's really knowledge based and not operational at all.

291
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,328
Speaker 1: And also, you know learning a lot.

292
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,404
Speaker 1: I didn't look at the internet like once the whole time I was at work.

293
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,360
Speaker 0: Well, you never look at the internet on your first day.

294
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,987
Speaker 1: You know what warning sign that hospital.

295
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,360
Speaker 1: two hours looking at FARC because no one would like meet with me to tell me what to do.

296
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:57,795
Speaker 0: So even you didn't even have a full day of HR papers to fill out.

297
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:01,347
Speaker 1: now actually today Five minutes of HR because it's an LLC.

298
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:05,538
Speaker 1: No, so it's like BAM nice plus, you know, I'm older now.

299
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,845
Speaker 1: I'm smarter I know what to expect.

300
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,611
Speaker 1: so I came in with my passport.

301
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,377
Speaker 1: I canceled check, you know all the stuff.

302
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,104
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I didn't do that.

303
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:14,691
Speaker 1: You know the last time I took a job.

304
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:15,997
Speaker 0: I always forget the cancel check.

305
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:16,680
Speaker 0: That's the one I forget.

306
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember it cuz I changed jobs.

307
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,893
Speaker 1: This is you know, you change jobs a while ago.

308
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,060
Speaker 1: I hadn't changed jobs like four years.

309
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:24,118
Speaker 1: I was waiting for this day.

310
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:28,473
Speaker 0: You remembered it better because it was longer ago.

311
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:28,573
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,920
Speaker 1: Well, I thought back.

313
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,457
Speaker 1: I was like what went wrong the last time I got a job.

314
00:16:32,517 --> 00:16:36,032
Speaker 1: the problems I had were I didn't know anyone's phone numbers for like the beneficiary stuff.

315
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,940
Speaker 1: I didn't even know my mom's address.

316
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,743
Speaker 1: I'd go like look it up.

317
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,532
Speaker 0: I always need my mom the beneficiary Social Security numbers.

318
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:52,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't need that yet because well Anyway, anyway, yeah, but so there's this article from today about some CMU researchers Carnegie Mellon, by the way Which is yeah, we know what that is.

319
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,156
Speaker 0: I'm some people might not almost went there.

320
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:54,960
Speaker 1: I run into people.

321
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,665
Speaker 1: I'm like RIT.

322
00:16:55,705 --> 00:17:06,792
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah RPI like no RIT RPI sucks but CMU is a good school and they uh, they came up with a pretty.

323
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:09,452
Speaker 1: this is one of those things like hey let's see if we can do it.

324
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:18,185
Speaker 1: and The fact that what they did as quickly and kind of half acidly hackishly as they did worked as well as it did is Kinda it's not

325
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:18,828
Speaker 0: scary to me

326
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:28,240
Speaker 1: cuz I knew but it might be scary to your mom with crappy off-the-shelf webcams and Fairly simple data mining of like Facebook.

327
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:36,079
Speaker 1: Okay, they were able to make a system where if you point a webcam at a crowd and it sees people's faces It'll find their Social Security numbers.

328
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:50,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, that could work because you get the face you match the face up with Facebook You get profile information get the name address whatever and then you look you basically get as much information as you can Start a really good or starting with flicker or Picasa.

329
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:55,058
Speaker 0: They just did Facebook apparently to start and then you just you start with just Facebook here.

330
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:55,620
Speaker 1: No, here's the thing.

331
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,975
Speaker 0: Here's the kicker and you just cross reference and if enough things match you can.

332
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:07,780
Speaker 0: just on different sites You go to you can just keep filling out the profile until eventually You hit a site that has social security number and you've now you've got the whole profile granted.

333
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,265
Speaker 1: That site is breaking the law.

334
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:13,640
Speaker 1: Well, duh, but here's the kicker that the thing that made this probably a lot easier.

335
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:22,320
Speaker 1: I didn't go into the depth of how they did it like on the low level but to this day Four digits of my social security number are in all my old RIT shit.

336
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,355
Speaker 0: Yeah you lot of times you could you could eat if you.

337
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:31,232
Speaker 0: I Imagine that like if they could get 80% of the real full numbers They could definitely get 99% of the last four digits.

338
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:37,739
Speaker 1: and here's the funniest part 60% of the students that they caught Didn't have Social Security numbers.

339
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:43,700
Speaker 1: So the it was crazy successful despite the fact that the majority of the people they were testing did not even have them.

340
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,869
Speaker 1: So it got some crazy percentage of the people who did.

341
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:47,631
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

342
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,313
Speaker 1: So what this illustrates is Something we talked about earlier.

343
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:53,260
Speaker 1: We have talked about a lot.

344
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,780
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about it recently that there's a lot of publicly available but difficult to get information.

345
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:03,137
Speaker 1: Like if you really want to stalk one person, this is what P eyes used to do.

346
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:06,240
Speaker 1: a private investigator Just gets publicly available information.

347
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:09,180
Speaker 1: It's not a crime to stand on the sidewalk and look at someone's house.

348
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,924
Speaker 1: Not a crime.

349
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,630
Speaker 1: just follow someone unobtrusively.

350
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,300
Speaker 1: not a crime to take a picture of stuff in public places.

351
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,719
Speaker 1: Go to public records freedom information act stuff.

352
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,709
Speaker 1: Technology allows you to do that to everyone all the time at zero cost.

353
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,311
Speaker 0: Yep.

354
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:25,520
Speaker 0: Oh really almost zero cost effective negligible cost.

355
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,295
Speaker 1: Yes couple this with the fact that there's well negligible cost per person.

356
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:33,691
Speaker 0: to actually do it to everyone at once You do need to buy a bunch of computers.

357
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:38,340
Speaker 0: your house per person will be zero But the cost of a rack will be like a thousand couple thousand a month.

358
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,214
Speaker 0: Well, I think it is Google.

359
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:44,960
Speaker 1: this is you know A lot of people are afraid of Google Maps and Google Street View and that's the least of your worries.

360
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:48,053
Speaker 1: I don't think Google should even be blurring out faces or anything.

361
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,860
Speaker 0: I don't understand the license plate thing.

362
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,471
Speaker 0: That's always really confuses me.

363
00:19:51,632 --> 00:19:55,487
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that aside All Google did was economy of scale.

364
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:59,300
Speaker 1: it had people basically do the equivalent of walk around and take a picture of everything.

365
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're actually.

366
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,460
Speaker 0: I wish they would do that.

367
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:09,630
Speaker 0: I heard that a while ago like months and months ago that they were gonna go into stores and take pictures in the stores If the stores let them.

368
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,860
Speaker 1: that would be so awesome, right?

369
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,985
Speaker 0: But I haven't actually seen that on any street views yet So I'm still been waiting for.

370
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:19,302
Speaker 0: the like announced that they've added that like if I could go and look in the bodega to see If they have.

371
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,270
Speaker 1: you know, dude, I'd go one step further.

372
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:23,500
Speaker 1: Here's a way for Google to actually make some money.

373
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:36,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a product what they could sell is a service where if you have an event like a convention You can pay them to send someone Probably just someone they hire like a contractor who uses their technology who goes into the event.

374
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:47,634
Speaker 1: for you know Repeatedly walking around gathering like these gigantic panoramas of your entire event like Otacon Imagine a navigable street view map of the interior of Otacon at like noon.

375
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,239
Speaker 1: Okay, that would be awesome.

376
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:51,383
Speaker 1: But anyway,

377
00:20:51,463 --> 00:21:16,010
Speaker 0: or like if they could temporarily update something on Google Maps like embed a map of your convention that weekend and then when the conventions over remove it or like Temporarily if you're having a concert at a football stadium, which means the seating chart is gonna change temporarily Embed the seating chart into Google Maps on the stadium for that weekend during the concert and then when the concerts over Switch the seat map back to the original football playing seat.

378
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,494
Speaker 1: couple that even further.

379
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:32,660
Speaker 1: you couldn't use GPS for this obviously but you could use either a creatively named access points that were set up ahead of time by Google or Some other like similar technology to make a local only Location system doesn't even have to be that precise.

380
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:38,679
Speaker 1: That gives you a map of the convention and a you are hair in the convention Even though it's in some ungodly bunker like the Javits.

381
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:42,090
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so so I got a news.

382
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,796
Speaker 1: I got to finish my point here.

383
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:57,339
Speaker 1: I often Explain to people who don't understand technology that they cannot have privacy because even if we make laws to protect them Hackers can trivially aggregate extent information that cannot by law be easily hidden.

384
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,974
Speaker 0: and If you did hide all the information you'd basically wouldn't be.

385
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,140
Speaker 0: you might as well not use computers.

386
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,420
Speaker 1: Yep, you'd have too much like there'd be no more freedom of speech.

387
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Speaker 1: Imagine if you couldn't tell another person that you saw a certain person on the street wearing a red cap.

388
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,425
Speaker 1: That's all Google does.

389
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,539
Speaker 1: Joe was wearing a red cap and he was standing in front of scandals.

390
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,772
Speaker 1: I Always try to tell people you can't get it.

391
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:21,557
Speaker 1: You can't get it.

392
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:21,999
Speaker 1: give up.

393
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:28,080
Speaker 1: You know, we've got to manage privacy before it's too late, but we can't keep privacy as we currently know it.

394
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:29,304
Speaker 1: No one believes me.

395
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:35,979
Speaker 1: if you ever run into an old person who doesn't believe that you can just aggregate information like this show them This article and scare the crap out of them.

396
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,599
Speaker 0: They'll just get more scared and do more reactionary stupidity Maybe.

397
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,547
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Adobe did something today.

398
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:51,131
Speaker 0: that so be slightly impressed me if that that's possible, you know, I Render don't you get a complaint about your premiere codec?

399
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:53,260
Speaker 1: I'm gonna one more me from like one complaint.

400
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:57,538
Speaker 1: You know, I recently put up an hour-long panel game mechanics and mechanism today.

401
00:22:58,302 --> 00:22:59,530
Speaker 0: It wasn't that bad, but I have.

402
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:00,999
Speaker 0: I keep saying right all the yeah.

403
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:09,032
Speaker 1: Whenever I'm talking I'm like scooting back and forth like scoot to the light But we're good forward to back a worse problem than scooting.

404
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:10,939
Speaker 0: is me going right, right, right, right.

405
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta I gotta work on the right.

406
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:16,180
Speaker 1: Well, what I do is when you're talking I keep touching my nose.

407
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,918
Speaker 0: That's why I keep zooming in on your nose that you're touching.

408
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:20,340
Speaker 1: I don't know.

409
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,692
Speaker 1: I just keep like poking at it pushing my glasses around.

410
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:23,818
Speaker 0: Oh, you got glasses.

411
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:26,048
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's a situation and I think it's cuz.

412
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,500
Speaker 1: I used to always fiddle with my mustache, but there's no mustache there.

413
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,833
Speaker 0: So I got a fiddle with someone's got to invent something about something for glasses.

414
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:32,476
Speaker 0: That's different.

415
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:33,540
Speaker 0: in the nose area.

416
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:34,483
Speaker 0: I don't know what.

417
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:35,627
Speaker 0: lazy.

418
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,537
Speaker 0: I guess they already have pads of gelatin, right lazy.

419
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,280
Speaker 0: I mean, how could you do?

420
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,156
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so Adobe they came out with a beta of this product called edge.

421
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:48,827
Speaker 0: It's totally free and Actually, it's pretty fascinating.

422
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,758
Speaker 0: I opened it up didn't know how to use it and just started using it.

423
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,062
Speaker 0: alright, and What?

424
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:58,151
Speaker 0: it is an animation tool and you know It does sort of like that in-betweening that flash does.

425
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:00,040
Speaker 0: so you go to time you go to the timeline.

426
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,248
Speaker 0: You said it's zero seconds.

427
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:12,000
Speaker 0: You put something in the top left corner You go to five seconds You move it to the bottom right corner and then you press play and it'll show you it's Sliding from the top left corner to the bottom right corner over the course of the five seconds, right?

428
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,228
Speaker 0: Beautiful easy to use animation tool totally awesome.

429
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:18,717
Speaker 1: That'll actually really useful for making content for panels.

430
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:22,465
Speaker 0: Well, actually It can only at the present time.

431
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:25,153
Speaker 0: It can only do rectangles rounded rectangles and text.

432
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,760
Speaker 1: Ah, okay, which is like wait a minute.

433
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,906
Speaker 1: You know what this reminds me of.

434
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,172
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take you way back.

435
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,780
Speaker 0: It's a free beta that only works for hundred.

436
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,340
Speaker 1: No what I'm saying, you know, there's flash and shockwave and all this stuff.

437
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:48,009
Speaker 1: Way back when I bought a ball time meat while my parents bought a multi media PC It came with a product called Macro media remember macro media and action.

438
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,154
Speaker 1: Okay, you know that was this.

439
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:50,996
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

440
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,540
Speaker 1: it could do things like this.

441
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,860
Speaker 0: No, you're not you're not finishing cuz flash can do all this animation stuff.

442
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:02,220
Speaker 0: But what this does specifically is not so much about the animation stuff that it does which flash already does.

443
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:04,086
Speaker 0: It is about its export.

444
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,955
Speaker 0: It only exports to HTML 5.

445
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:09,969
Speaker 0: Oh That's all it does.

446
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,040
Speaker 0: So you go you can save it as HTML 5.

447
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,806
Speaker 0: It gives you CSS JS and a div and you put that div in a web page with those CSS and JS Included and there's your animation.

448
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,054
Speaker 0: Oh, they added support for audio.

449
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:21,676
Speaker 0: you could.

450
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:22,880
Speaker 0: and vector arts.

451
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:26,938
Speaker 0: You could make a homestar runner and you'd be all set, but I don't think it does.

452
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:28,676
Speaker 0: vector arts I don't think they plan to do that.

453
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:32,834
Speaker 0: So I think what it's gonna end up being is just text and boxes and images.

454
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:35,362
Speaker 0: So you basically would make Webpages.

455
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:37,706
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it'll go a little bit beyond that they're gonna.

456
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:44,912
Speaker 0: it's gonna be web pages with animations in them That are all smooth and fancy as of right now, but pretty chill.

457
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,056
Speaker 0: It's it's actually.

458
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:47,460
Speaker 0: the user interface was really good.

459
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,445
Speaker 0: It didn't crash.

460
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:51,060
Speaker 0: It was actually pretty fast for Mac and PC.

461
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:51,888
Speaker 0: It's free for 150 days.

462
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,491
Speaker 0: Some of the stuff is one of these.

463
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:58,802
Speaker 0: I looked at all the CSS and JS files It makes.

464
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:02,676
Speaker 0: so the files that it makes that are part of your project have no license.

465
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:03,659
Speaker 0: So I assume you own them.

466
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:14,095
Speaker 0: It does have two jQuery files those are open source and two JS files of one of which is BSD licensed and one of which you were free to distribute but not to modify.

467
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:18,976
Speaker 0: so so one of the JS files is BSD and one of them was there.

468
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,207
Speaker 0: but it's like It's produced.

469
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:28,258
Speaker 0: It's a Adobe product that outputs something Almost entirely open source as opposed to some locked up SW.

470
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:28,720
Speaker 0: What the hell?

471
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,066
Speaker 1: They must have gotten like a really good intern or something the fuck.

472
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:34,763
Speaker 0: They're smoking and it works and it does animate.

473
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:35,825
Speaker 0: so this is it's free for 150 days.

474
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:43,111
Speaker 0: get it now and Maybe make something awesome with it before it becomes $500.

475
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,518
Speaker 1: so Adobe when you get a support video formats in premiere.

476
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,841
Speaker 0: Yeah, when these Let's move on.

477
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,948
Speaker 1: so things of the day.

478
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,909
Speaker 1: What do you got for me Scott?

479
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,030
Speaker 0: It's a really good video.

480
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,010
Speaker 0: You know the those old videos like let's go out to the whatever.

481
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,848
Speaker 0: And it was you know, they're like dancing popcorn and the dancing.

482
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:14,683
Speaker 1: I saw one of those that was not ironic at the drive-in when I was a kid.

483
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:15,566
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

484
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had drive-ins You know, it's just that little.

485
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:27,203
Speaker 0: you know Those little cartoon videos that are sort of you know famous the watch in the movie theater and they're telling you to go out to the concessions to get Popcorn right and to make you thirsty for Pepsi or some shit.

486
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:28,930
Speaker 1: This is just one of those you should watch.

487
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,422
Speaker 0: Well, this isn't really one of those sort of a take on one of those right.

488
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:39,739
Speaker 0: that is pretty interesting and very Professionally well made by MK 12.

489
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:40,882
Speaker 0: It's called follow the Sun.

490
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:42,928
Speaker 0: Make sure you watch the whole thing.

491
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,619
Speaker 0: Don't stop You might get bored.

492
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:45,930
Speaker 0: It's like three or four minutes long.

493
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,586
Speaker 0: I know you have short internet attention spans, but this is one of those ones where it builds.

494
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:50,370
Speaker 0: trust me.

495
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:59,010
Speaker 0: It builds and it's got sort of a catchy tune like Right, so just keep watching it all the way to the end.

496
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:01,869
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's entirely safe for her work.

497
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:05,021
Speaker 0: It is not safe for work, but just watch the whole thing.

498
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:05,783
Speaker 0: Trust me.

499
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:06,486
Speaker 0: This is great.

500
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:07,750
Speaker 0: And it's not really made.

501
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,280
Speaker 1: It's no Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it has a similar.

502
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,182
Speaker 1: you'll see.

503
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:14,248
Speaker 1: it's subtle and then unsubtle.

504
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch it It's great.

505
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:19,209
Speaker 1: I saw this a while ago and I forgot about it.

506
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,395
Speaker 0: Oh and mix it with ponies.

507
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,263
Speaker 0: cuz ponies go well with everything.

508
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,660
Speaker 1: That'd be a pretty good mix actually Kind of like that to our ring you mix.

509
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:27,450
Speaker 1: so I got something really simple.

510
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,477
Speaker 1: This is just the Batman equation.

511
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:48,710
Speaker 1: for any math nerd who's ever seen the Batman equation, which is holy holy plus something equals Goddamn, but no, that would be a Robin equation kid minus two ex parents plus Joker.

512
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,710
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this is just a fairly large equation that you can grab.

513
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:54,855
Speaker 1: It's a fairly like.

514
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:02,890
Speaker 1: it's relatively simple to understand though I defy anyone who is not insane to look at it and figure out what it graphs.

515
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,190
Speaker 1: Just from looking at it without a lot of well now that they know it's the Batman equation.

516
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the Batman equation.

517
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:10,550
Speaker 1: It turns into Batman and it's kind of new.

518
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,450
Speaker 0: So basically you type it into your graphing calculator and the bat logo appears.

519
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the kind of thing that you should have on hand to impress the girls at high school calculus class.

520
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,385
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah.

521
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,755
Speaker 0: So metamoment.

522
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:28,879
Speaker 0: well, I mean it's not gonna impress any girls but on the On the off chance that it impresses a girl.

523
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:29,861
Speaker 0: That's the one.

524
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,423
Speaker 0: don't let her go.

525
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:31,766
Speaker 1: I want kids.

526
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:35,327
Speaker 1: the Rainbow Dash equation It's not gonna happen might happen.

527
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:43,050
Speaker 1: So the metamoment metamoment metamucil book club book is is all right the the ear the eye and the arm.

528
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:48,341
Speaker 0: Yeah, yes Rim still hasn't uploaded the book club book episode, but it's already recorded.

529
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:48,642
Speaker 0: Yes.

530
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:50,510
Speaker 1: It'll be up as soon as I have time been busy.

531
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:54,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you might actually hear this before hearing the foundation episode, but we recorded it.

532
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:55,729
Speaker 0: Yes, it was done.

533
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,325
Speaker 1: Other metas we have a fax is coming soon.

539
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:17,362
Speaker 1: We're doing Discover the Forgotten Masters brand new panel.

540
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:21,817
Speaker 0: don't even know what it's gonna be cuz I've written it But it involves an Atari 2600.

541
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:22,499
Speaker 1: Yeah.

542
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,281

Speaker 0: Yeah, you should like us on Facebook.

545
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:41,790
Speaker 0: Right now I'm manually cross posting things to Facebook But I've already coded the site to automatically cross post things to Facebook and as soon as I launch the new updated site of front Recruit comm it will automatically post everything into Facebook.

546
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,277
Speaker 0: So you won't have to come to forever.

547
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:46,010
Speaker 0: I've given up on trying to get people to come to the site at this point.

548
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,557
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the site is basically for at this point one.

549

Speaker 1: I will occasionally post like a link to all the slides from panel.

550
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:53,830
Speaker 0: It's like at this point.

Speaker 0: if you use geek nights as two words and make a mistake Yep, still number one all right of course But we have.

566
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:36,836
Speaker 1: you know we put up our for one of our PAX lectures from PAX East last year on YouTube in the geek nights rim YouTube channel.

567
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:43,283
Speaker 1: I have now uploaded the second of our three panels a Second running of game mechanics and mechanism design.

568
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:43,705
Speaker 1: I thought

569
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:49,073
Speaker 0: it wasn't as good as the first time We did it, but I watched the video today, and it was alright except for me saying right Yeah, we

570
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:53,830
Speaker 1: ran it way better the first time we ran it, but I was kind of tired when we ran it at PAX.

571
00:31:54,331 --> 00:32:00,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, East 2011, but the third panel how to win at games will be up as soon as I have time to edit it together.

572
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:01,970
Speaker 0: Oh, I forgot we even had a third panel.

573
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:08,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, and keep your eye out because I am rapidly going to add a lot of video content for geek nights also.

574
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:12,254
Speaker 1: You pig fuckers You know what what.

575
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:18,337
Speaker 1: the first question we got on game mechanics and mechanism design to YouTube was guys Where's radio free equestria?

576
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:19,764
Speaker 1: I mean we made these pilots.

577
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:20,970
Speaker 0: It's not a regular show.

578
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,075
Speaker 0: We made three pilots.

579
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:25,270
Speaker 0: coming Jesus you kids your regular show is for later.

580
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:28,562

588
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,488
Speaker 0: don't just post in the forum thread.

589
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:56,470
Speaker 0: forum Right your suggestion you actually have to go.

590
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,550
Speaker 0: There's a Google Docs form to fill out your submission for the worst webcomic contest.

591
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:07,430
Speaker 0: That is the only place to officially submit where you can win a prize and be considered along those lines.

592
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:09,642
Speaker 1: Stop submitting control alt elite.

593
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:14,036
Speaker 1: we already said that yeah, but I Okay, and I got it.

594
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,601
Speaker 1: preface this one last little thing.

595
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:20,268
Speaker 1: you if you submit an entry to this you might think This is a little bit of a mean-spirited contest.

596
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:27,950
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, so you if you don't actually create something are worse than whatever it is that you are submitting whoever created.

597
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,354
Speaker 1: That is better than you as a human.

598
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:31,239
Speaker 0: so feel bad and shitties.

599
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:37,721
Speaker 0: better than making a really poorly drawn furry porn Fanfic where you're the otter with in Star Trek.

600
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:44,084
Speaker 0: that guy's better than it's better than someone who makes Nothing unless I mean if Mike and Jerry you know penny arcade.

601
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:46,814
Speaker 1: if they submit a comic yeah Yeah, they get.

602
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:47,897
Speaker 1: they can call something shitty.

603
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:49,222
Speaker 0: They get away with it.

604
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:50,707
Speaker 0: They can diss whatever they want.

605
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:55,261
Speaker 0: alright, so We already did a show on version control systems.

606
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:55,682
Speaker 1: Yep.

607
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:59,116
Speaker 1: We have not done one on change management But that's more of.

608
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:02,070
Speaker 1: it's almost a more like release management.

609
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:09,978
Speaker 0: Those the same thing yeah anyway, but you know get is one of the few hot new Technologies that I am extremely familiar with.

610
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:10,460
Speaker 1: Scott.

611
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,850
Speaker 1: I would argue knows more about it than most people at this point.

612
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:21,230
Speaker 0: Well, I think the thing was is just because at my last job You know I was working with a guy who was pretty Linux II and he started using git like slightly before it was cool.

613
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:23,407
Speaker 0: So I started using it slightly before it was cool.

614
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:26,864
Speaker 1: Yeah Like hey, and I was like what do you mean?

615
00:34:26,885 --> 00:34:27,529
Speaker 1: I use RCS.

616
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:34,183
Speaker 0: I was in the nub stage of git when other people didn't know it existed Except for really hardcore Linux people.

617
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:41,789
Speaker 0: and then when it became popular I had already sort of mastered the user parts and by now I've mastered the underneath parts which most people don't even know about.

618
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,454
Speaker 1: yeah I mean, I'm.

619
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:44,330
Speaker 1: I'm currently a nub at git.

620
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:44,958
Speaker 1: I mean I may.

621
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,969
Speaker 1: I have a GitHub account that I haven't logged into in a while and yeah.

622
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,141
Speaker 0: So the thing with git is that it is a version control system.

623
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:58,124
Speaker 0: Just like subversion or whatever Except it is architecturally different and that it is distributed right.

624
00:34:58,144 --> 00:34:59,630
Speaker 0: there is no canonical.

625
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,810
Speaker 0: This repository is the repository.

626
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:06,602
Speaker 0: Instead every repository is the full repository.

627
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:08,468
Speaker 0: So you have a. you have it on your computer.

628
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,030
Speaker 0: you clone You don't check out you clone.

629
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:14,090
Speaker 0: You have the whole thing the whole history of the project on your computer.

630
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:22,930
Speaker 0: You edit that history and then you share commits with other people in a distributed mesh Fashion and that you know, that way anyone can do as they please.

631
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:27,870
Speaker 0: Alright, and this has many benefits and you know drawbacks, but mostly benefits.

632
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:35,790
Speaker 0: Once you understand it and use it properly You'll see that subversion and other centralized version control systems are just awful.

633
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,099
Speaker 0: There is a come some competitors.

634
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,130
Speaker 0: the chief among them is mercurial which is written entirely in Python.

635
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:44,075
Speaker 0: You know There's all sorts of arguments to be made.

636
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:44,838
Speaker 0: is one better?

637
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:45,680
Speaker 0: is one worse?

638
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:48,570
Speaker 0: the general consensus mercurial is a little easier to use.

639
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:50,722
Speaker 0: Git has slightly better performance.

640
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,190
Speaker 0: They have a lot of feature parity.

641
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:58,863
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter that much but it seems to get his one, you know GitHub is destroyed bitbucket.

642
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:03,109
Speaker 0: So I Mean bitbucket still exists, but github is definitely winning.

643
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,481
Speaker 0: GitHub is sort of the way of the future.

644
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:14,030
Speaker 0: if you're not using git now You should learn it because if you're doing anything with software, that's where it's at And such alright, so I mean, what's that?

645
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,759
Speaker 1: Like what are the primary benefits for getting the architecture?

646
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,609
Speaker 1: that I doubt many of our listeners will know much about?

647
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,779
Speaker 0: well The primary benefits are distributed.

648
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:24,070
Speaker 1: if you can tell I don't know a lot about git.

649
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:29,996
Speaker 0: Well, do I mean I could start from like the bottom up if you want but I might be a little boring now Maybe maybe later.

650
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,810
Speaker 1: Let's know what you know what the listeners always want.

651
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:40,039
Speaker 1: They're always like well the listener always wants us to go in depth at our own level and to not like Pull back from our level of technological prowess.

652
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,182
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's here's I'll get.

653
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,550
Speaker 1: let's talk about this the way we talk about this stuff.

654
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,693
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's how git works.

655
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:45,075
Speaker 0: ready.

656
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:45,737
Speaker 0: You have a file.

657
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:46,037
Speaker 1: Yep.

658
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:49,127
Speaker 0: You hash the file with sha very strong hash.

659
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:56,770
Speaker 0: You're very unique Right, yeah, so what you do is you take a file you hash it you create a what's called a blob in git terminology.

660
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:04,113
Speaker 0: Right, so that blob contains the contents of the file compressed and whatever right and the name of that blob will be the hash The sha1 hash.

661
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:04,435
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

662
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,706
Speaker 0: You update the hat you update the file you update the blob.

663
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:08,870
Speaker 0: It's that simple, right?

664
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,262
Speaker 0: So you create a new repository in that file.

665
00:37:12,323 --> 00:37:13,929
Speaker 0: in that repository you have some files.

666
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:18,650
Speaker 0: You add them all to what's known as the staging area the index, right?

667
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,026
Speaker 0: So basically this is advantage number one of git is the index.

668
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,935
Speaker 0: most You know things like subversion.

669
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:29,609
Speaker 0: you edit files and you commit and it commits all your changes no matter what files.

670
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:30,371
Speaker 0: they are Right.

671
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:35,690
Speaker 0: So if you what say want to have two files that are edited and you want to commit one file and not the other.

672
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:40,430
Speaker 0: You have to actually roll one of the files back commit and then roll the file forward, right?

673
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,253
Speaker 0: It's sort of annoying.

674
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:50,190
Speaker 0: in git you actually add your changes to the staging area The index and then when you commit the index is what is committed.

675
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:56,510
Speaker 0: Right, so you can actually if you do an interactive add you can actually add part of a file.

676
00:37:56,913 --> 00:38:05,193
Speaker 0: So if I edit a file and I change two functions I can actually add one of those changes to the one of the functions to be committed and let the other one just stay as A dirty chain.

677
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:06,618
Speaker 0: Oh, it's pretty crazy.

678
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,550
Speaker 0: So you stage and then you commit, right?

679
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,090
Speaker 0: So that's that's the first advantage of git just from the user perspective, right?

680
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,324
Speaker 0: So anyway under the hood, right?

681
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:17,330
Speaker 0: It's making blobs.

682
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,526
Speaker 0: so everything is uniquely hashed which means that whatever you put into git is what you're gonna get out.

683
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:27,872
Speaker 0: a lot of other version control Systems don't actually guarantee that what you put in is what you get out With git.

684
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:31,650
Speaker 0: whatever you put in guaranteed to get out because if the hash don't match ain't gonna fly.

685
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:37,010
Speaker 0: So a commit in git is what's known as a tree.

686
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:44,070
Speaker 0: It's a tree and that tree is a list and the list is a list of trees and blobs.

687
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:45,399
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

688
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:46,470
Speaker 0: It's trees and blobs.

689
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:51,104
Speaker 0: So a tree would might you know would be the top level of your repository which would be your commit Yeah.

690
00:38:51,531 --> 00:39:02,010
Speaker 0: and then underneath that would be trees which would be the sub directories and in those sub directories would be blobs and When you commit it just creates a new tree with the new blobs and the new trees in it.

691
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:08,722
Speaker 1: So when I've pulled out like I've brought down the repository or whatever I basically got the entire like everything in the project just local.

692
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:12,656
Speaker 0: you have the entire history of Every commit that has ever been.

693
00:39:12,676 --> 00:39:16,670
Speaker 1: so I could step back through to like the hello world of the project.

694
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,119
Speaker 0: You absolutely could all right, you wouldn't even have to step.

695
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,183
Speaker 0: you just reset to it.

696
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,750
Speaker 1: Does this I mean?

697
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:25,641
Speaker 1: Does this cause disk space issues ever for people?

698
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:29,171
Speaker 0: I mean it is highly compressed and incredibly efficient I guess.

699
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:34,790
Speaker 1: does anyone use git for the management of things that aren't code like large images or video or anything?

700
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,330
Speaker 0: Oh, it's actually incredibly efficient at doing those things.

701
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:42,948
Speaker 0: You are you are going to obviously have to use a lot of disk space Yeah, but if I'm doing like video I have to use like anyway.

702
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:46,402
Speaker 0: It is better at that than the other version control systems.

703
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:49,236
Speaker 0: Well, I found it will not crash under the weight It was originally.

704
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:50,870
Speaker 0: git was originally gonna be a file system.

705
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:52,577
Speaker 0: So, you know if you have?

706
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:57,356
Speaker 0: I did not know that if you have 10 1 gig video files sure It's gonna be a 10 gig download.

707
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,602
Speaker 0: But yeah, but that's expected.

708
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,390
Speaker 1: It's gonna be 10 gigs if I use the version.

709
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, but switching between versions is like basically instantaneous once you've downloaded it.

710
00:40:04,828 --> 00:40:05,270
Speaker 0: You're all set.

711
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:13,624
Speaker 1: The performance of git is is off the chart considering that local disk space is Effectively infinite in the modern world.

712
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,590
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah Git is actually really useful for things other than code just because it's so good.

713
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:28,706
Speaker 0: like if you go to github all the wiki's on github are actually powered by git and I've actually I've actually figured out a way to do wiki show notes on our site powered by git.

714
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:29,830
Speaker 1: Ooh, we kind of need that.

715
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,923
Speaker 0: It's pretty crazy when you once you see how it works.

716
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:36,167
Speaker 0: It's it's intense All right, so where was I?

717
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,528
Speaker 0: You're oh, yeah can get be used for.

718
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,118
Speaker 0: yeah You can use git for anything you want.

719
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:40,561
Speaker 0: a version.

720
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,170
Speaker 0: writing a book gets a great idea.

721
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:48,169
Speaker 0: Anything that you need to basically have another level of undoing and versions on git is a great way to go.

722
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:54,390
Speaker 0: So you make these commits and every commit is a tree and every commit has a hash of its own, right?

723
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,136
Speaker 0: So that's an easy way to identify.

724
00:40:56,156 --> 00:41:02,770
Speaker 0: a commit is by its hash and a commit also has one other thing Which is a pointer to the previous commit in the history.

725
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:10,649
Speaker 0: So commit number one points at nothing but commit number two points at commit number one and every commit is a full tree full of trees and blobs.

726
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:18,290
Speaker 0: So the main thing here that this allows you to do that other version control systems don't allow you to do is easy branching.

727
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,920
Speaker 0: Right in subversion making a branch is a big deal.

728
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,410
Speaker 0: You've got one shared repository if you make a branch.

729
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:29,250
Speaker 0: That's a branch for everyone not just you right and it's a big deal to make a branch and then to merge your branch.

730
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:30,777
Speaker 0: Forget it kill yourself.

731
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,043
Speaker 1: I've never done it.

732
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:37,310
Speaker 0: I've given up People who have mastered it and can get it done with a minimum of pain.

733
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:41,870
Speaker 0: But if you do get properly you can always avoid the pain, right?

734
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:45,444
Speaker 0: So you can just branch like a nut job, right?

735
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:50,830
Speaker 0: You just be like, oh, yeah I'll make a branch over here to branch over there and what I tend to do which is a good best practice.

736
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,759
Speaker 0: That's that's another thing people can get confused about.

737
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:54,000
Speaker 0: git.

738
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,530
Speaker 0: is that other version control systems because they're so limited?

739
00:41:56,952 --> 00:42:03,229
Speaker 0: There's only one workflow you can follow if you want to use them but git lets you do anything Which means it's like what workflow do I have?

740
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,630
Speaker 0: You have to make up a workflow and you have to enforce that workflow with just people and talking to each other.

741
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:10,839
Speaker 1: I imagine that's very difficult for many people.

742
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:17,090
Speaker 0: There's no technological enforcement of the workflow But there are certain practices that will sort of grease the wheels.

743
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:30,010
Speaker 0: So it's like you have to simultaneously know the path to follow to grease the wheels to make to have less conflicts and merge problems While simultaneously getting people to behave in a certain way so that you know, everything runs smoothly.

744
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:30,251
Speaker 0: it

745
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:51,510
Speaker 1: is however, I think in the long run a more fruitful path than say like ticketing systems are an example of this where you need to enforce certain workflows and The only way people ever do it is to make rules like a ticket cannot be set to a resolved state unless X Y and Z Have already happened to the ticket Unless it actually hasn't assignee because you can and the thing is once you go down that path.

746
00:42:51,952 --> 00:43:00,349
Speaker 1: You can't trust people for shit because if there is any way to do the thing You don't want them to do they will do it and in their mind, it's okay because they'll let them do it.

747
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:09,504
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It's like the difference between a ride with a car where you're on a rails no matter how what way you turn the car goes That the straight way anyway versus an f1 car.

748
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:10,770
Speaker 1: if you turn off the track you just die.

749
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:11,834
Speaker 0: Well, that's the.

750
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:14,804
Speaker 0: that's the thing because git is distributed right subversion.

751
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:26,530
Speaker 0: a commit in subversion Actually pushes your code to the central repository if there's a bunch of people working on the project together Which means one person can just commit and fuck the whole thing up in git.

752
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:33,690
Speaker 0: Everyone's working locally with their own copy of the repository and they're only sharing when they explicitly share.

753
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:36,887
Speaker 0: So committing making checkpoints It's free, you know.

754
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:43,190
Speaker 0: to Reset and roll forward and back for your code is completely independent of sharing code.

755
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:48,170
Speaker 0: So you can make checkpoints to make your life easier locally without sharing those checkpoints with anyone.

756
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:52,610
Speaker 0: So that would greatly reduces any chance of fucking things up right right up the get-go.

757
00:43:52,714 --> 00:44:02,670
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I can't imagine but like the subversion I used to use at another company like pulling the repository down to my laptop Working on stuff for a week like on a trip or something coming back to work and kind of put that back in.

758
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,560
Speaker 0: Well, that's another thing.

759
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:04,390
Speaker 0: right subversion.

760
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:10,263
Speaker 0: You only get the most current version of the code when you check out Which you can't work if you're not online if you're not connected.

761
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:11,550
Speaker 0: get you have the whole thing.

762
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,547
Speaker 0: You can work completely offline, you know, it doesn't matter where you are open.

763
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:17,783
Speaker 1: as a version I could pull down what I'm working on and lock it for everyone else.

764
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:19,210
Speaker 0: You could do that.

765
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,796
Speaker 0: There's no locking and get right.

766
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:24,150
Speaker 0: So so when you do want to share something, right?

767
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,750
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of different ways to do it.

768
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,637
Speaker 0: You could share by email if you freaking want to.

769
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:30,790
Speaker 0: you could give someone a gz file on a stick if you want to.

770
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:31,668
Speaker 0: Right, you can do whatever.

771
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:34,840
Speaker 0: But generally people tend to do things in two ways.

772
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:41,593
Speaker 0: You could set up a Just a communally agreed upon central repository and push to it Right.

773
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:45,570
Speaker 0: So push should be a separate command and you would just send your commits to that.

774
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:53,267
Speaker 0: you know repository on whatever branch you wanted to send them on to and then other people would pull them and You would all be disciplined and no one would mess it up.

775
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:57,690
Speaker 0: That's what we do at work, but it breaks down when you have too many people, right?

776
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:09,407
Speaker 0: So when you have too many people like you do say on Linux What you do is you do a pull request Which is you email someone or call them on the phone or say hi and you talk to them and you say that's

777
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:11,936
Speaker 1: quite a difficult Protocol for many developers.

778
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:19,350
Speaker 0: I know and you say look my repository is over in this place And I have some commits on it that I would like to submit for your consideration.

779
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,600
Speaker 0: Please pull from my repository.

780
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,366
Speaker 0: All right, and this is how github works.

781
00:45:24,426 --> 00:45:25,530
Speaker 0: is github has pull requests.

782
00:45:25,912 --> 00:45:33,550
Speaker 0: So if you go on github you clone someone's project you do some work on it you finish it You push your code back to github from your local, right?

783
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:36,030
Speaker 0: So you push it from your local to your github.

784
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:41,690
Speaker 0: Then you do a pull request telling the other guy to pull your github into his github.

785
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:42,292
Speaker 0: You see how it's like.

786
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:44,038
Speaker 0: everyone has all these different copies of it.

787
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he gets a pull request notification on github.

788
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:50,930
Speaker 0: He takes your code from your github to his local machine.

789
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:55,229
Speaker 0: Hopefully check, you know puts it on a separate branch where it won't mess anything up.

790
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,760
Speaker 0: Checks your code out sees how good it is.

791
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,250
Speaker 0: sees if it's working merges it in with his code.

792
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:01,129
Speaker 0: See is how that works.

793
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:06,481
Speaker 0: If he likes your code, then he'll merge it in and push it to his repository There by accepting your pull request.

794
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:10,850
Speaker 0: if he doesn't like your code He'll just throw that branch away and give you the finger and ignore you.

795
00:46:10,995 --> 00:46:13,163
Speaker 0: All right And but the thing is your code isn't lost.

796
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,294
Speaker 0: you still have it Right, if you don't like?

797
00:46:15,515 --> 00:46:19,390
Speaker 0: if you like your thing a different way than he likes it then you maintain your own branch.

798
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:20,357
Speaker 0: Good for you.

799
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:21,445
Speaker 0: You forked it.

800
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:22,050
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

801
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:22,953
Speaker 1: so how well like.

802
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:32,810
Speaker 1: how does it handle merging like if two people have edit like you're trying to merge two branches where the Fundamental difference is like one section of code is just like two people implemented it way different.

803
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:37,987
Speaker 0: Okay, so get merges are pretty complex here, but they're also the most powerful and the best right?

804
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:38,710
Speaker 0: So here's how it works.

805
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:43,047
Speaker 0: Remember I told you a commit is just a tree that has trees and blobs under it.

806
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:43,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

807
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:47,750
Speaker 0: So I want to merge two branches together, right?

808
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:55,110
Speaker 0: So I take these two branches and all it looks at really is The top commits because a branch is just a pointer to a commit.

809
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:55,893
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

810
00:46:56,455 --> 00:47:02,767
Speaker 0: and it just so happens that if you are on a branch and you commit it Automatically moves the branch pointer ahead to the new commit.

811
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:03,229
Speaker 0: That's all it does.

812
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:07,064
Speaker 0: So a branch is just a pointer an easy way to specify a commit.

813
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:08,730
Speaker 0: So I might say master.

814
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:10,717
Speaker 0: Well master is currently pointing at this commit.

815
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:14,069
Speaker 0: So master is just an easy way of saying that commit.

816
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:18,849
Speaker 0: All right Head is just an easy way of saying the commit I'm currently looking at.

817
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:22,001
Speaker 0: So head is just a pointer that looks at the commit you're currently looking at.

818
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:27,150
Speaker 0: and if you make a new commit head and the Rancher on get both get moved forward to point at the nuke, right?

819
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:27,592
Speaker 0: They're all.

820
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:29,910
Speaker 0: just point me all these names are just pointers to commits.

821
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:42,230
Speaker 0: So if I merge let's say I have a production branch and I go to the production branch and I say get merge master Right, which would take the commit of the master branch and merge it with the production branch, right in right?

822
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:48,410
Speaker 0: What happens is it takes the top it takes production which remember is just a commit.

823
00:47:48,590 --> 00:48:00,952
Speaker 0: yeah, it takes a master which again is just a commit and Then it looks at their histories and it rolls back to find the common ancestor and it doesn't care about any of the commits in between.

824
00:48:01,032 --> 00:48:04,900
Speaker 0: all it cares about is the two commits you're merging and the common ancestor.

825
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,980
Speaker 0: So then it looks at each blob in both commits.

826
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:15,246
Speaker 0: So let's say that all that's in there is a readme text and some other Five readme text.

827
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:20,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it looks at the first readme text and it says alright this readme text I'm production branch.

828
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:26,100
Speaker 0: Was there any difference between this this readme text between production and the common ancestor?

829
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,683
Speaker 0: No, okay.

830
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:33,198
Speaker 0: Well, is there any difference between this readme text on between master and the common ancestor?

831
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,164
Speaker 0: Well, yes Yes, there was a change.

832
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:37,572
Speaker 0: So in the master branch this file changed.

833
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:39,880
Speaker 0: Yep, but in the production branch did not change.

834
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:44,454
Speaker 0: Nope, we're we're just gonna take that master change aren't we that easy merge?

835
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:45,738
Speaker 0: just do take the master done.

836
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:46,480
Speaker 0: Um easy.

837
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:48,876
Speaker 1: So what if the two readmes diverged?

838
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:56,020
Speaker 0: ah So both in the case where both readme files have changed there were edits on production and there were edits on master.

839
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,348
Speaker 0: Well, were they the same edits?

840
00:48:58,629 --> 00:48:59,532
Speaker 0: exactly the same?

841
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:01,840
Speaker 0: because then that case we're just right.

842
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm assuming no bro, because that's the more interesting case.

843
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,340
Speaker 0: So no, they're not the same.

844
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,840
Speaker 0: There were some edits on the production branch and there's some edits on the master branch that were different.

845
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,610
Speaker 0: Well, are these edits like on the same line?

846
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:15,580
Speaker 0: You know, it has actually a bunch of different merge algorithms.

847
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,996
Speaker 0: It uses that.

848
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:17,616
Speaker 0: it tried All right.

849
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:25,797
Speaker 0: So let's say one one of the things added a commit at the top of the file and one of the things added a comment At the bottom of the file, it'll just merge them together.

850
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:27,037
Speaker 0: No problem Uh-huh, right.

851
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:31,051
Speaker 0: But let's say two people edited the same function.

852
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:34,260
Speaker 0: the same line of code is two different lines.

853
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:40,969
Speaker 0: Right since the common ancestor, it'll say Dude conflict yo and you.

854
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:53,477
Speaker 0: what you'll have to do is you have to open up the file and you look through the file And you see a bunch of chevrons and it'll basically say hey, dude Look this line on the production branch looks like this and on the master branch looks like this Manually edit me.

855
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,670
Speaker 0: So you manually edit that one area of the file.

856
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,400
Speaker 0: remove all the chevrons and all the extra crap it threw in there.

857
00:50:00,023 --> 00:50:13,040
Speaker 0: Right get the file just the way you want it to look post merge Add it to the staging to the index the staging index and commit and then it'll be merged nice And of course it keeps the versions of everything along the way because it's good.

858
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:19,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course Alright, so, you know There's no way you could possibly lose anything unless you intentionally try to lose something.

859
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:30,826
Speaker 0: and even if you do lose something Like you accidentally like remove something You could actually check the git ref log and bring it back because unless the garbage cleaner has come along It won't actually be gone.

860
00:50:31,548 --> 00:50:34,578
Speaker 0: Which is really the git ref log has saved my ass quite a few times.

861
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:39,098
Speaker 0: Let me tell you So yeah merge is pretty fancy like that.

862
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,894
Speaker 0: But the other thing about git that's incredibly powerful is the rebase.

863
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,346
Speaker 0: a lot of people if you look online They'll be like don't use rebase.

864
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:48,531
Speaker 0: That's a naughty thing to do.

865
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:49,575
Speaker 0: They're totally wrong.

866
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:50,800
Speaker 0: They don't know what they're talking about.

867
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:54,067
Speaker 0: There's a reason the tools in there They wouldn't have made it if you weren't supposed to use it.

868
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:57,340
Speaker 0: Linus Torvalds wouldn't have made rebase if you weren't supposed to use rebase.

869
00:50:57,962 --> 00:50:58,203
Speaker 0: All right.

870
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:02,240
Speaker 0: So what rebase does is it basically rewrites history it rebases.

871
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:06,080
Speaker 0: So say for example, I start working on a new feature.

872
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:09,000
Speaker 0: I'm gonna add to the website the ability to post on Facebook.

873
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:12,318
Speaker 0: So I make a branch called the Facebook branch and I start working on it.

874
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:19,520
Speaker 0: Meanwhile you add the ability to post to Twitter right and you finish and now you put it on the master branch.

875
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:27,399
Speaker 0: So I forked the master branch and to add my Facebook feature, but your Twitter feature is now on the master branch But it's not in my Facebook branch.

876
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:34,280
Speaker 0: But it needs to be alright because I need to build my stuff taking your stuff into consideration because you finish your work first.

877
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:40,734
Speaker 0: Therefore I have to get my work to work on top of your work Right, and I don't want to just try to merge the two together when I'm all done.

878
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:42,220
Speaker 0: that could be painful.

879
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:44,339
Speaker 0: It might work, but it could be painful.

880
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:49,234
Speaker 0: So what I do is I rebase my branch onto the master branch.

881
00:51:49,254 --> 00:51:56,139
Speaker 0: What that does is it takes all my commits on My Facebook branch and sort of puts them in a bin on the side.

882
00:51:56,901 --> 00:52:02,540
Speaker 0: Okay, so now my right and then it takes your commits and it puts them right there, right?

883
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:04,207
Speaker 0: Where my Facebook commits just were.

884
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,020
Speaker 0: so now my branch and master look the same.

885
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:13,480
Speaker 0: Then it takes my Facebook commits and it puts them right on top of your Twitter commits on my Facebook branch.

886
00:52:14,302 --> 00:52:15,466
Speaker 0: So now I've rebased.

887
00:52:15,506 --> 00:52:17,010
Speaker 0: you see how I picked my stuff up.

888
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:20,220
Speaker 0: I made a new base for my stuff, right?

889
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,846
Speaker 0: Do you understand you get what I'm saying?

890
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:28,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right now this also has other Fancy powers and this is where the magic comes in.

891
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:29,840
Speaker 0: the magics the magics.

892
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:33,114
Speaker 0: I'm working on an open-source project say I'm making a Linux kernel driver.

893
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:34,459
Speaker 0: It's hard work.

894
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:38,340
Speaker 0: So I make a lot of commits locally a lot of checkpoint commits, you know.

895
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,840
Speaker 0: And a lot of these commits are just like fix the typo out of the line testing this out.

896
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,608
Speaker 0: Oh that didn't work.

897
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:44,679
Speaker 0: revert it, you know.

898
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:55,840
Speaker 0: And I just keep making tons and tons of commits all locally and eventually after ten days and a hundred commits I finished the driver, right now the Linux kernel doesn't want to see a hundred commits.

899
00:52:56,562 --> 00:53:03,640
Speaker 0: Right, I can't be like hey Linus pull request hundred little commits with typos and all this nonsense for this one driver.

900
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,488
Speaker 0: He'll be like screw you.

901
00:53:05,508 --> 00:53:08,540
Speaker 0: I don't want your hundred commits cluttering up the history of Linux kernel.

902
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,102
Speaker 0: It's you're.

903
00:53:09,382 --> 00:53:13,594
Speaker 0: you're basically, you know, as far as you're personally concerned those hundred commits have meaning.

904
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:20,863
Speaker 0: but as far as it's basically one version like 1.0 as far as line, you know Linux the kernel is concerned It's one commit.

905
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:26,807
Speaker 0: that commit should have a message like added new driver for lousy webcam That only Scott has right?

906
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,479
Speaker 0: That's all he wants one commit with that whole change in it.

907
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:31,500
Speaker 0: So what you do is you rebase?

908
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:40,488
Speaker 0: Against yourself you rebase the branch against itself and you do an interactive rebase Which is allows you to manually control the rebase.

909
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:56,511
Speaker 0: and what you would do is you would actually squash the commits with this rebase Into just one commit that you would then share So that you it allows you to rewrite the whole history of what you just did on that branch Uh-huh, and then merge just that one really pretty commit back in.

910
00:53:57,052 --> 00:54:01,874
Speaker 0: so you can make a whole bunch of messy commits all on your Own that make it really easy to do your work.

911
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:07,308
Speaker 0: because you have all these checkpoints You can roll them back and forward take them in and out You can try to a function other people.

912
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:11,808
Speaker 0: you can decide you don't like it take it out or place it with something else You know and you can have this whole.

913
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:28,204
Speaker 0: your whole workflow history is there You know to make it really easy to get the job done and try all sorts of stuff out Branches and all sorts of merging and nonsense, but when you're finally said and done You can rebase everything into one cozy commit that can then be shared With other people.

914
00:54:28,244 --> 00:54:32,360
Speaker 0: that is clean and beautiful and no one will see all that mess you made when you were working locally.

915
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,274
Speaker 0: But you do and you still have that history.

916
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:35,000
Speaker 0: It doesn't go anywhere.

917
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:39,252
Speaker 0: It's hidden inside so you can always go back to it if you need to.

918
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:41,680
Speaker 0: you know, oh adding that one line was a mistake.

919
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:42,886
Speaker 0: I'll just go and find that.

920
00:54:43,027 --> 00:54:47,287
Speaker 0: you know commit that got rebased in revert it and Read, you know make a new man.

921
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:48,954
Speaker 1: that makes a lot of sense in light of like.

922
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:50,039
Speaker 1: go back to my video example.

923
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:52,166
Speaker 1: say I Wanted to use that for like video collaboration.

924
00:54:52,547 --> 00:55:00,554
Speaker 1: Well, I have a thousand one gigabyte commits of this video and The project manager doesn't want a thousand gigabytes of crap.

925
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:02,020
Speaker 1: They want the final one.

926
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure how exact.

927
00:55:03,828 --> 00:55:06,640
Speaker 0: I haven't done a lot with binary files so much and get at least not big.

928
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,300
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

929
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,777
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure if it only stores the diffs of the binary files or if it actually stores the whole files.

930
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:14,723
Speaker 1: that diffs of Binary files are often.

931
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:24,575
Speaker 0: but the thing is even though even though it will be expect exceptionally good At performance of saving space and being very fast at executing commands.

932
00:55:25,136 --> 00:55:26,100
Speaker 0: Don't fool yourself.

933
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:30,620
Speaker 0: You know with subversion when you check something out you are only checking out the newest version.

934
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,366
Speaker 0: So it's a pretty quick download.

935
00:55:33,008 --> 00:55:41,016
Speaker 0: if you try to clone the Linux kernel and get the complete history from git It takes a long time to download because even though it's mostly just code.

936
00:55:41,056 --> 00:55:45,128
Speaker 0: In fact, it's almost all code There's a lot of it and the history is long.

937
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:49,740
Speaker 0: It takes a long time to download that it's a big package.

938
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:51,251
Speaker 0: Don't fool yourself.

939
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:51,615
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

940
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:59,198
Speaker 0: So if you if you consider download time to be incredibly important, you know that that is a negative.

941
00:55:59,599 --> 00:55:59,940
Speaker 0: it's there.

942
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:01,542
Speaker 0: There.

943
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:02,987
Speaker 0: there are tons and tons of fancy things.

944
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:07,188
Speaker 0: I can go on for like hours talking like git bisect and which like you would Git bisect.

945
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:12,180
Speaker 0: I won't tell you how it works But what it does is you tell it lets you have a bug and you don't know when the bug appeared.

946
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:19,580
Speaker 0: You tell it the last known good commit and it will roll forward one commit at a time asking you is this commit good?

947
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:20,179
Speaker 0: Yes, no.

948
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:22,327
Speaker 1: So I could run that through a regression tester.

949
00:56:22,347 --> 00:56:26,240
Speaker 1: that regression tests every commit until it hits the one that fails the test.

950
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:30,140
Speaker 0: And I know you know that that's you know, which commit introduced the problem.

951
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:35,160
Speaker 0: And yeah, you can run it through an automatic testing system that will automatically mark the commits as good or bad.

952
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,449
Speaker 0: So it'll automatically just play good.

953
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,294
Speaker 0: This is the bad commit.

954
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:39,359
Speaker 0: This is where the problem came from.

955
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:43,479
Speaker 0: It can do all sorts of crazy shit.

956
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,342
Speaker 0: There's like hooks.

957
00:56:44,704 --> 00:56:46,971
Speaker 0: so you'd be like here's a here's a shell script.

958
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:49,920
Speaker 0: whenever anyone commits automatically execute the shell script.

959
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:52,547
Speaker 0: Whenever anyone pushes execute the shell script.

960
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:57,440
Speaker 0: so you can have like your git repository email everyone when there's a new commit or stuff like that.

961
00:56:58,065 --> 00:56:59,700
Speaker 0: You can do tagging of releases.

962
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:03,632
Speaker 0: You can do bringing tons and tons of ridiculous shit.

963
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:06,181
Speaker 0: that most you can do get blame is really good It.

964
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:09,539
Speaker 0: no it knows who edited every single line and every single file.

965
00:57:10,202 --> 00:57:11,246
Speaker 0: So you do a git blame.

966
00:57:11,286 --> 00:57:16,553
Speaker 0: when you see a bug and see who exactly introduced that bug cuz their name is right there on The line, you know who did it?

967
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,452
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I know it's just.

968
00:57:19,553 --> 00:57:20,240
Speaker 0: it's crazy shit.

969
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:31,136
Speaker 0: but if you are You know if you've never used version control or even if you have been using it or if you're coding anything Even the simplest little project personal thing just for yourself.

970
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:32,240
Speaker 0: That might be one file.

971
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:38,720
Speaker 0: It's worth the distort and git even if you're not coding if you're doing anything where versioning might be a good idea, right?

972
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:41,537
Speaker 0: I mean, I know that like doesn't Microsoft Word do versioning in itself?

973
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:46,499
Speaker 1: now Yeah, and a lot of people use like web dev and stuff to do that sort of good God.

974
00:57:47,035 --> 00:58:01,459
Speaker 0: Yeah you want to use if you're doing any work that needs to be versioned where you want to be able to roll back to old Versions rolled in new versions if you're working collaboratively on something with anyone that is in that is files especially text files.

975
00:58:02,302 --> 00:58:04,499
Speaker 0: You want to use git and you want to learn it?

976
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:10,096
Speaker 0: Even if you start out using it just really simply don't bother with the fancy stuff like rebase and whatever.

977
00:58:10,136 --> 00:58:17,000
Speaker 0: just do commits on one Branch push and pull between two people what you know, just use github in the simplest way possible.

978
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:18,545
Speaker 0: That's okay.

979
00:58:18,605 --> 00:58:29,353
Speaker 0: You're doing something and even though you don't know the advanced features You might need them and when you do come to need them You can look them up how to use them to save your ass Or you can get someone to help you save your ass.

980
00:58:29,394 --> 00:58:37,129
Speaker 0: if you're using something else Saving your ass might not be a possibility and you know, that's the thing with git is like, you know It's the whole hog of Neil Stevenson, right?

981
00:58:37,149 --> 00:58:39,800
Speaker 0: It's this incredibly powerful drill that you could just fucking kill yourself.

982
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,520
Speaker 0: It's so powerful, but it can always get the job done.

983
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,443
Speaker 0: So you could.

984
00:58:44,306 --> 00:58:48,060
Speaker 0: it can shoot yourself in the foot, but it can also unshoot yourself in the foot.

985
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:50,935
Speaker 1: And of course with the whole hog, you can't undrill a hole.

986
00:58:50,955 --> 00:58:56,200
Speaker 0: That's true But get you it's very hard to get to ruin it completely.

987
00:58:56,421 --> 00:59:05,487
Speaker 0: It might be also really hard to get it back to goodness, but it's possible almost always possible to fix Anything and it's all.

988
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:09,358
Speaker 0: it's definitely possible that no matter what problem you're in you can escape.

989
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,572
Speaker 1: so kids Just remember it's trees and blobs all the way down.

990
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,957
Speaker 0: It is trees and blobs all the way down.

991
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:24,870
Speaker 1: pretty much This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
