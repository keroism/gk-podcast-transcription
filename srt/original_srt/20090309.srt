1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,925
Speaker 1: It's Monday March 9th.

2
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:11,687
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:15,420
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight the telecommutes.

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,932
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:32,665
Speaker 1: I was gonna ski this weekend.

6
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,390
Speaker 1: I was really looking forward to it.

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,096
Speaker 1: It was like cold and perfect all week.

8
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:37,462
Speaker 0: We know that skiing is over.

9
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,569
Speaker 1: No, it's not actually.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,132
Speaker 1: no It's not.

11
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:42,200
Speaker 1: you realize it's gonna snow here like tomorrow.

12
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,224
Speaker 0: I know it's not.

13
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,637
Speaker 0: it's gonna get cold again It's not gonna get that cold.

14
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:47,441
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it is.

15
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,607
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll pull up the NOA.

16
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:51,315
Speaker 1: But anyway Last week early last week.

17
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:52,880
Speaker 1: It was freezing cold.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,363
Speaker 1: It was perfect skiing weather and the news was like, yep It's gonna be cold all week and then starting next week.

19
00:00:58,403 --> 00:00:59,590
Speaker 1: It's gonna get warm for a little bit.

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:08,388
Speaker 1: I'm like, alright, and then every day the forecast got a little bit warmer for the weekend and then Saturday and Sunday It was like 65 degrees wearing shorts.

21
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:13,650
Speaker 1: So while I wanted to ski I couldn't really complain that much because I got to wear shorts.

22
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:21,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the thing is you know you need me if you could ski even in that kind of weather if the mountain is High enough.

23
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:33,730
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is depending on the weather and what was there before, you know, what came before Skiing and like 50-degree weather in the right conditions is like the most fun you'll ever have because it's super comfortable and you're still skiing.

24
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:36,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

25
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:42,897
Speaker 0: but you know The thing is if it's 50 degrees at the top of the mountain the snow is all melting well melting But it depends on what kind of snow you got.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:53,793
Speaker 0: I guess if you like, you know you if you can Can you like add salt to the snow that makes it melt, you know quicker right, but I don't know I'm not a snow.

27
00:01:53,853 --> 00:02:06,550
Speaker 0: if you had some sort of like reverse salt that you could add to the snow to sort of You know like raise the freezing point, you know, so that maybe you know stayed frozen at like 40 degrees or something.

28
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,270
Speaker 0: You know what I'm saying?

29
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:12,810
Speaker 0: Because you can add salt to make it, you know melt at like, you know lower than you know freezing.

30
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:16,085
Speaker 0: So couldn't you dad reverse salt to do the opposite?

31
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:17,953
Speaker 1: Ah Probably not.

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,137
Speaker 1: What's reverse salt Scott?

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,301
Speaker 0: some other chemical that you know has it as a Freezes higher freezing point I get I don't know.

34
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:33,629
Speaker 1: but regardless we had the crew out scientists Help me out here played some burning wheels And then I was happy that we haven't had a good argument forever in the front row.

35
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,457
Speaker 1: crew Like, you know, we're all atheists.

36
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:38,750
Speaker 1: everyone kind of is generally, you know liberal socially.

37
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,300
Speaker 1: There's very little we disagree on in terms of the big issues.

38
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:43,725
Speaker 0: So finally we don't.

39
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,050
Speaker 0: usually we have agreements.

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,201
Speaker 0: Disagreements is when someone finds out something new.

41
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:52,310
Speaker 0: that sort of contradicts what they already knew, right?

42
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,070
Speaker 0: So someone changes their mind and then starts to go and tell it to everyone else and they'll be like, hey, that's not right.

43
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:07,254
Speaker 0: And then they hard sort of had to go and drag up all their evidence and that everyone goes Is definitely a.

44
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,761
Speaker 1: you're not like inverting wheel when you make a character.

45
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:21,617
Speaker 1: if you're there's one question that basically says if you lived in like a difficult adversarial intellectual Community as a child plus one to your steel stat That's kind of what it's like in the front row crew.

46
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:30,981
Speaker 1: if you if you so much as imply that you have an unbacked up Statement that you're about to make like everyone's ready to jump on you good, so we had.

47
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:39,130
Speaker 1: we had a Transhumanism argument which is great because it's one of those things where other than historical trends There's no evidence of what the future is going to be like.

48
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:47,471
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just you know extrapolation and assumption on both sides and it all comes down to ethics and morals and like the fine distinctions Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,296
Speaker 1: So that went on for like two hours.

50
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:54,229
Speaker 1: Scott missed it, which is good because I guess I think the last argument we had.

51
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,810
Speaker 1: you Explained that you're the uber mesh and thus you're beyond all of our trivial concerns.

52
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:10,828
Speaker 0: Yes, I am which is I was so beyond your trivial concerns that I had no need to take part in your argument Because I already knew the correct answer and you're not worthy of hearing it from me.

53
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,492
Speaker 1: So what is the correct news Scott?

54
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:16,959
Speaker 0: the correct news is this?

55
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:21,600
Speaker 0: Say in Sweden the Pirate Bay, they're doing their business, right?

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,160
Speaker 0: I think that they finished up, but I don't think there's been a verdict yet.

57
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,795
Speaker 0: I think we're waiting for that still and if we're not still waiting for it.

58
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:35,800
Speaker 0: Well, I haven't seen the result and so Someone please tell me what it is, but I'm pretty sure we're waiting for the result there.

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:05:04,678
Speaker 0: But one country away from Sweden in Norway All right, the exact opposite is happening and basically Norway's public broadcaster, which I assume is the equivalent of like PBS in the United States is Taking their shows and they set up a bit torrent tracker using the same exact software the Pirate Bay uses for their bit torrent tracker and is putting all their stuff up on bit torrent.

60
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:21,275
Speaker 0: but Unlike say for instance BBC's I player right which doesn't let people outside of the UK Watch all the you know free BBC stuff online The Norway's bit torrent tracker is completely DRM free.

61
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:22,700
Speaker 0: It's completely open.

62
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,132
Speaker 0: it's just bit torrent right.

63
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:31,966
Speaker 0: and Not only does that mean that you can you know Subtitle translate whatever.

64
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:41,856
Speaker 0: they are actively trying to get people to fan sub Their programs now and you see you can send in the subtitle tracks and they'll add them in.

65
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,784
Speaker 1: this is brilliant Absolutely brilliant.

66
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:49,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I mean think about this right Norway, you know, Norway is cool and all.

67
00:05:49,896 --> 00:06:00,569
Speaker 0: but they're not exactly a big player In the world, right, but by making their public broadcasting freely available to the world Popular BBC stuff is in the United States.

68
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:07,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, they can project their culture You know around the world far more strongly than you know.

69
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,018
Speaker 0: Someone who like keeps all their media like, you know closed and locked in.

70
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:22,106
Speaker 1: well especially with the signal-to-noise ratio is definitely increasing and More and more good media as my thing of the day is gonna point out is free and it's freezing beer It's freezing speech.

71
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:24,079
Speaker 1: It's just free and you can just watch it.

72
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:32,684
Speaker 1: So the more barriers anyone puts in the way of getting media be it paying be a DRM be it, you know Advertising anything.

73
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:37,780
Speaker 1: every one of those barriers is in the end kind of making your media further away from people.

74
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:41,255
Speaker 0: You know, I mean think about this right what you know?

75
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:49,435
Speaker 0: if you thought about You know, let's say it was the year 1995 right and you tried to think of like, you know, what really you know?

76
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:57,660
Speaker 0: media things sort of The culture and society you'd think about, you know, Nintendo sorts of things, you know in terms of us, right?

77
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,991
Speaker 0: You think about Ninja Turtles, maybe maybe something Disney.

78
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:05,107
Speaker 0: ish, you know Disney Afternoon kind of thing, you know That's that's the sort of stuff you would.

79
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:07,839
Speaker 0: I you know where I would think about from those days, right?

80
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,420
Speaker 0: but You know nowadays what do you maneuver?

81
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,200
Speaker 0: Right, it's and all the stuff that is paid for DRM door locked in.

82
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,880
Speaker 0: I mean sure there's still a lot of people out there who are all over, you know, I mean even us.

83
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,960
Speaker 0: We're like, you know South Park and other things like that, right?

84
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:41,976
Speaker 0: Exactly None of this stuff that is like difficult to get at is is making it out there, you know, even Like just you know big movies that you have to pay like, you know, the Watchmen is.

85
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,865
Speaker 0: it's getting pretty big But you know what?

86
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:46,140
Speaker 0: It's not it's not as bad that big.

87
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:51,145
Speaker 1: You're saying Watchmen isn't as big as Numa Numa, I Don't know.

88
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:51,973
Speaker 0: in the long run.

89
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,059
Speaker 1: It's One thing we can think it's bigger than Numa Numa.

90
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:57,666
Speaker 1: Specifically what we can't say yet.

91
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,789
Speaker 1: Is that the Watchmen movie.

92
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,318
Speaker 1: it is still like it's still coming out like Washington.

93
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:03,080
Speaker 1: It is still coming.

94
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:19,818
Speaker 1: We're not sure how many people it's going to kick apart just yet because it's I mean I see enough people who have no connection to comic books or who don't care about superheroes or anything Like being into the Watchmen that Watchmen might come out of nowhere to become.

95
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:27,020
Speaker 0: well Cuz I think the one thing is that when something has high quality it can sort of go over the barrier, right?

96
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,429
Speaker 0: So it's like you put up this barrier around your stuff.

97
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:34,970
Speaker 0: if your stuff is like a super strong Super high jumper, it's gonna jump right over that wall.

98
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,414
Speaker 0: No problem because it's that good.

99
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,780
Speaker 1: Well, that's one of the things that's great.

100
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,839
Speaker 1: it means that you free media is there and free media competes with other free media.

101
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:53,913
Speaker 1: and While free media competes with the walled-off media You can make a much higher quality walled-off media thing just by the nature of the fact that well You can make out you can make just as high quality thing.

102
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:55,159
Speaker 0: That's not walled up.

103
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:56,502
Speaker 1: You're saying.

104
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,528
Speaker 1: you're saying you can make Watchmen with no barrier.

105
00:08:58,568 --> 00:08:59,591
Speaker 1: It's completely free.

106
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:00,514
Speaker 1: There's no.

107
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:02,460
Speaker 1: there's no possible way to make money off it.

108
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,955
Speaker 1: It's just there.

109
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:04,630
Speaker 1: You could have made that.

110
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:05,838
Speaker 0: well the comic book.

111
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:07,444
Speaker 0: You're assuming that.

112
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:12,240
Speaker 0: if you're talking about the movie, you're assuming that higher production value and cost equals better.

113
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:20,724
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying that what if you commercial media media that is made with a barrier with the intention of using that barrier to entry To make money?

114
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:21,146
Speaker 0: not all.

115
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,180
Speaker 0: but the other thing is the barrier really has nothing to do with being commercial or not.

116
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,780
Speaker 0: There's plenty of non commercial things that have barriers Well like dwarf fortress exactly.

117
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,438
Speaker 1: But I'm talking specifically about commercial media that specific kind of barrier the toll of paying money or watching ads to see it.

118
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:47,420
Speaker 1: Hmm The Quality that something has to be becomes much higher to get the current generation of kids and people Especially kids and the generations coming to bother with it at all.

119
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:53,899
Speaker 1: So I think we're gonna see this like distillation of commercial media and at the same time We're gonna see this flourishing of free media.

120
00:09:54,281 --> 00:10:03,787
Speaker 0: I think we have already seen a distillation of you know, the commercial media because basically, you know It's like the stuff that people actually Really care about and really like.

121
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:07,660
Speaker 0: they're sort of going out of their way to get it and everything else is being completely ignored.

122
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:16,556
Speaker 1: Yep, but look at and I'm talking about in terms of media production - I mean me is splitting between Game show slash reality TV that cost nothing to make.

123
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:21,783
Speaker 1: so as a result You can make a lot of money off it even though there's a barrier you know lowest common denominator and all that.

124
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:45,132
Speaker 1: and then they're really high quality like the HBO stuff where like Dexter where there is a That that barrier is so worth it that you're like There's the gap between the crappy media with the lowest common denominator and low production values and the high quality High production value cost to get in just just commercial media is widening.

125
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:47,800
Speaker 1: and then the free media is like this whole third pillar.

126
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:52,172
Speaker 0: I'm just looking forward to experiencing some Norwegian television.

127
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:56,645
Speaker 1: I am as well because if nothing else Scandinavian nor real.

128
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:02,140
Speaker 1: all that whole area their folklore and their folk tales kick the shit out of American folk.

129
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:02,654
Speaker 1: What do we have?

130
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:02,818
Speaker 1: we have?

131
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:07,254
Speaker 0: Are you sure that folk tales or what's gonna be on their public broadcasting?

132
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:08,820
Speaker 1: No, but I mean think about it.

133
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:18,680
Speaker 1: there was a lot of media in America that's based on like Americana or American culture or American like idioms or you know the old cartoons about Johnny Appleseed and Paul Bunyan.

134
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:23,520
Speaker 1: I want to see the equivalent of that from Finland and Sweden and Norway.

135
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:25,218
Speaker 0: It's all about fish.

136
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,139
Speaker 1: So I don't want to talk a lot about this.

137
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,174
Speaker 1: But as you all know Circuit City is gone now.

138
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:38,400
Speaker 0: the final days happened And yeah, you can't if you were hoping to buy stuff at a bargain too late.

139
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:47,512
Speaker 1: I went to the Circuit City on like Fifth Avenue on the third to last day and Let me tell you it was a sad sight.

140
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:54,464
Speaker 1: What was left was basically like broken store models of things that were like 80% off Broken fixtures.

141
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:59,036
Speaker 1: like there were people buying like hooks off of shelves for ten cents each.

142
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,620
Speaker 0: I would have taken hooks.

143
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:03,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, they weren't the kind of hooks we can use unless you were also buying those shelves.

144
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:05,599
Speaker 1: You happen to own those kinds of shelves they weren't.

145
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:08,131
Speaker 1: There were pieces of metal basically.

146
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,440
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess you could buy one.

147
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,760
Speaker 1: I mean if I were a mugger I could have bought some pretty good mugging implements in there for real cheap.

148
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:20,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fixtures are always the best things to buy because you know You can you have like space in a house.

149
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,840
Speaker 0: you can set those things up and it's pretty nice.

150
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a good spinner rack.

151
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:25,127
Speaker 0: Those are worth it.

152
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,960
Speaker 1: But the thing is there was nothing left at all.

153
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,805
Speaker 0: Didn't you buy like?

154
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:33,377
Speaker 0: can you buy like a four megabyte SD card for like 25 cents?

155
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,780
Speaker 1: No, cuz those were all gone even the four megabyte ones.

156
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:42,918
Speaker 0: There was nothing left except the thing listening like the four megabyte like so small that it's worthless.

157
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:43,620
Speaker 1: They weren't there.

158
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:44,727
Speaker 1: There was nothing left.

159
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,840
Speaker 1: There were a couple of broken store models of things.

160
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,840
Speaker 1: There were like two couches real cheap.

161
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,076
Speaker 1: But I was on my own and it would cost me more to ship the stupid thing back up here.

162
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:54,822
Speaker 1: then it wasn't worth My couches.

163
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, like leather couches.

164
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:57,530
Speaker 0: I had couches.

165
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:57,951
Speaker 0: Yeah.

166
00:12:58,032 --> 00:12:58,292
Speaker 0: Wow.

167
00:12:58,573 --> 00:13:00,138
Speaker 0: What about the car stereo section?

168
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:00,860
Speaker 1: I empty.

169
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:09,722
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, but but in the back where the CDs are there without like thousands of CDs I Don't know.

170
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,935
Speaker 0: wouldn't the CDs get like discounted so much.

171
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:12,660
Speaker 0: They're just clean eyes.

172
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:20,560
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't need to buy a CD But if a CD is like a dollar or 50 cent I'll buy it and take it to the secondhand music store.

173
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:27,752
Speaker 0: So on Amazon is there were a ton of CDs and I could have quit my job Bought all the CDs for 50 cents each and then sold them all in a while.

174
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:28,515
Speaker 1: They weren't selling.

175
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,204
Speaker 1: they were not Discounted that much.

176
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:33,149
Speaker 1: they were five to fifteen dollars.

177
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:37,300
Speaker 0: These things don't sell at Best Buy when they're not discounted.

178
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:41,014
Speaker 0: So why would they sell it in a going out of business sale?

179
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,144
Speaker 0: if they're not just my suspicion now I don't know.

180
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:47,993
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know exactly what the deal was But my bet is that the rule.

181
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:54,100
Speaker 1: there was some sort of rule Where they weren't allowed to discount the CDs below a certain amount because you've seen that before.

182
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:55,549
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things like that.

183
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:57,440
Speaker 1: Like you can't sell Apple stuff below?

184
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were but the iPods weren't discounted at all.

185
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:01,040
Speaker 1: Those were gone.

186
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,522
Speaker 1: I think they could.

187
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,607
Speaker 1: they shipped those somewhere else.

188
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:03,892
Speaker 1: But yeah, I don't.

189
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:08,520
Speaker 1: maybe they weren't allowed to discount the CDs I don't know, but no one was even looking at him either.

190
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,953
Speaker 0: I wonder if you bought a car stereo like at the clearance.

191
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:12,615
Speaker 0: Would you still?

192
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:13,760
Speaker 0: would they still do an installation?

193
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:20,060
Speaker 1: Would you want the guy working in Circuit City and the last day to install something in your car?

194
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,027
Speaker 0: Maybe he'd be so passionate about it.

195
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,854
Speaker 0: He was like he was a hardcore dude.

196
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,200
Speaker 1: Actually, there was this good picture.

197
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:26,649
Speaker 1: I found it somewhere on the internet.

198
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,279
Speaker 1: I'd link to it, but I don't remember where I saw it.

199
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:36,231
Speaker 1: It was one of those Circuit City signs at a Circuit City and it was like car stereo 80% off TVs 40% off dignity point 2% off.

200
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,710
Speaker 1: Oh I was proud of that.

201
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,659
Speaker 1: but now my real news.

202
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,639
Speaker 1: so Apple and the iPod and the iPhone.

203
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:53,524
Speaker 1: The iPhone is a closed platform and you've got to like, you know Go through all this rigmarole to sell your stuff in the Apple Store and they can say what goes in and what doesn't and all That stuff.

204
00:14:53,565 --> 00:15:02,137
Speaker 1: and you all know that Apparently so many people are developing or trying to develop for the App Store That Apple is just completely dropping the ball.

205
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:09,415
Speaker 1: now Like if you request the right to use it It might take months or you might just never get an answer.

206
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:11,716
Speaker 1: and they'd like if you call them They have no idea what you're talking about.

207
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:21,840
Speaker 1: People's contracts are like expiring apparently and they try to renew them and like no one answers their phone and no one tells them what to do and Like it's really falling apart on the developer side.

208
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:34,740
Speaker 0: This is this is really interesting because I don't I don't think we've actually I can't remember an instance where this happened where someone would Try to keep something closed right and in keeping something closed and limited you need a bureaucracy to sort of manage.

209
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:46,198
Speaker 0: You know everything and if the bureaucracy can't keep up with the demand You know everything just sort of collapses and it's it's real interesting to sort of be like, huh?

210
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,464
Speaker 0: At least they're sort of having to.

211
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:53,620
Speaker 0: you know, sure they're dicking all of us by keeping it closed, but they're paying for it.

212
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:02,034
Speaker 0: It's costing them to keep it closed which makes you think you know Even if they would perhaps, you know lose whatever they would lose.

213
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:06,658
Speaker 0: perhaps, you know for having apps They don't like or you know, whatever else, right?

214
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:12,700
Speaker 0: Maybe they would actually make more money if they kept it open and got rid of all that bureaucracy in the way.

215
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,519
Speaker 1: Well, what's interesting to me is that that you know?

216
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,187
Speaker 1: there are many reasons.

217
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:26,860
Speaker 1: you could have a closed platform and one idea that's or at least a Special restricted thing like say they had the everything goes app store and then they had the Apple certified app store.

218
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:29,193
Speaker 1: They'd like check your app out and make sure it's not crap.

219
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:29,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be fun.

220
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:34,932
Speaker 1: But Looking through what's available on the App Store like 99% of it is garbage.

221
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,869
Speaker 0: Well, I mean we talked about we didn't.

222
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,136
Speaker 0: I don't think we did talk about.

223
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:40,658
Speaker 1: no we didn't.

224
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,225
Speaker 0: It was like what.

225
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:45,276
Speaker 0: the one news we missed right is basically someone did.

226
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:53,843
Speaker 0: it was like there's an ad I think was an advertiser who does iPhone ads and in because they're doing iPhone as they have all this information about iPhone Apps.

227
00:16:53,903 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaker 0: right because the ads are in the apps and they sort of found out what everyone already knew which is that People like to install apps But they install them use them once and then usually never use them again and they pretty much only use a few apps very frequently.

228
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,007
Speaker 0: You know, I mean I have an iPhone right?

229
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:13,867
Speaker 0: I use the iPod app the phone app The Safari the mail.

230
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,256
Speaker 0: I use those the most and those are built in.

231
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:23,640
Speaker 0: I mean You know that there's very few stuff that does not built in that I actually use a lot, you know.

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:37,339
Speaker 0: And so what I did is I saw that news and I was like, yeah, that news is exactly right and I'm like well I'll just go through here and delete all these apps that I never use and I deleted a whole mess of them and it you Know cleaned up my phone a whole lot.

233
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:42,940
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's gonna be a big kind of day of reckoning with the App Store because the iPhone like had this big search.

234
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,622
Speaker 1: Everyone got one.

235
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,128
Speaker 1: and then what is the same thing?

236
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:52,076
Speaker 1: when you get like a Vista Vista PC and you have that little bar on The side for widgets and you look at like all the widgets like can I use that?

237
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:52,618
Speaker 1: Can I use that?

238
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:53,482
Speaker 1: That's cool That's cool.

239
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:57,259
Speaker 1: And you put like 10 in there and then a week later you get rid of nine of them.

240
00:17:57,862 --> 00:17:58,927
Speaker 0: Yep, if you even bought.

241
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:02,241
Speaker 0: the thing is some people don't bother like they put all the widgets there and then they just don't look At them.

242
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't think about him, but it just it.

243
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,036
Speaker 1: I feel I don't know but I feel like so.

244
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:10,150
Speaker 0: people love setting up Widgets, but people don't actually use them.

245
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,238
Speaker 0: It's like the Mac dashboard same thing But I wonder what?

246
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,859
Speaker 1: Apple nominally part of this was that they only want good stuff to be in the eye in the store but yet most of the stuff in the store is overpriced garbage.

247
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:34,191
Speaker 1: and now so many people want to develop but more and more they seem to deny the apps that people really really want like Syncing podcasts just over the air without any trouble or ad block.

248
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,014
Speaker 0: Yep.

249
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:39,164
Speaker 0: It's kind of it's kind of crazy I Don't know.

250
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:40,896
Speaker 0: I think the real problem is.

251
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:48,940
Speaker 0: another problem I think people don't recognize the whole bunch is that you know, the App Store itself has a really bad user interface.

252
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,074
Speaker 0: It's really I mean this, you know thousands and thousands of apps, right?

253
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:53,500
Speaker 0: Well, how can you look at these apps?

254
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,171
Speaker 0: You can look at the top apps in any given category, right?

255
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:00,080
Speaker 0: You know, whatever they do, however, they determine that right?

256
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:18,799
Speaker 0: I guess based on recent popularity You can look at paid or free separately and you can search if you know the name of an app alright and that you can you know, so the thing is there's a lot of there's probably good apps that are hidden way down there where no one can find them and There's crap apps coming up to the top.

257
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:26,297
Speaker 0: And I mean, I guess you can like browse all the apps in a given category in alphabetical order going like next page next page next page.

258
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:37,976
Speaker 0: but it's like it's really really difficult to You know, it's like find anything in there, you know it, you know Maybe there's something in there that's gonna change your life and you're actually gonna use it every day.

259
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:38,880
Speaker 0: Good luck finding it.

260
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:41,040
Speaker 0: You're never gonna come across that, you know.

261
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:49,460
Speaker 0: And even apps that were like pretty popular like maybe like like a few weeks ago Now they're like they're just as hidden as like all the crap at the bottom.

262
00:19:49,600 --> 00:20:02,820
Speaker 0: So if you you know buy an iPhone like today, you're not gonna find out like Tetris which came out You know, like when the iPhone came out, it's totally hidden I'm sure people who want Tetris search for the world.

263
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:04,979
Speaker 0: Yes, if you want Tetris you search for it.

264
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,892
Speaker 0: But like if you don't, you know There's other stuff that if you what you're never gonna think.

265
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:17,907
Speaker 1: at the same time isn't the point that When people go out looking for something to install as opposed to looking for a specific thing They'll install crap that they don't actually use?

266
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,112
Speaker 0: that's exactly correct.

267
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:19,754
Speaker 0: You know, you shouldn't.

268
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,205
Speaker 0: there's so many people that like hey Are there any cool apps?

269
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,310
Speaker 0: It's like dude.

270
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,555
Speaker 0: don't think like that.

271
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:33,991
Speaker 0: You should think If when you know don't install anything and then if you need something Then search for what you need as you need it, right?

272
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,475
Speaker 0: That's the way to go about things.

273
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:36,960
Speaker 0: However, right?

274
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:55,799
Speaker 0: There are occasions which there is something you need But you just don't know you need it and that that situation does exist and that's they can't be fulfilled Unless you have some sort of way for things that people need but they don't know they need or sort of put in front of Their face every once in a while.

275
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:04,550
Speaker 0: you know and the app store sort of fails at that and I think it's actually costing a lot of Developers, you know revenues.

276
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,040
Speaker 0: It's like you're making a lot of money in the app store.

277
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,146
Speaker 0: You could be making a lot more.

278
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,479
Speaker 0: people can actually, you know, see your app at some time.

279
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:16,012
Speaker 1: My only hope is that the the fact that more and more the crap apps are not selling as well At least as far as I could tell.

280
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:16,820
Speaker 1: based on that article.

281
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,540
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe things will change if there's another surge of iPhone users.

282
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:20,242
Speaker 0: But

283
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:38,026
Speaker 1: Apple's gonna have to change something if they want this platform to succeed because while the Android is not an optimal solution either If things continue the way they are I feel like the open platform is going to win out in the end just for the fact that the open platform is gonna have A browser with adblock in it and over-the-air Podcasting

284
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:43,320
Speaker 0: and I really think that you know The palm is gonna have trouble because it's coming out on spray and it's coming out.

285
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,900
Speaker 0: It's sort of a black time, but if it wasn't coming out on sprint, I would I'd be all about that.

286
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:55,467
Speaker 0: I think that if the palm at pre is all it's cracked up to be that in the in the you know Mid to longer term it's gonna.

287
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:59,860
Speaker 0: just it's just gonna hose everything because people are still familiar with palm.

288
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,265
Speaker 0: You know that they still.

289
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:05,521
Speaker 0: you know, they were all trio users before they were blackberry users, you know They were.

290
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:06,906
Speaker 0: that's what they were doing.

291
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:11,340
Speaker 0: and it you know, it's all web-based and you know, there's web developers.

292
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:19,491
Speaker 0: You know, it's way easier and there's way more of them than there are, you know People who can make freakin objective-c iPhone apps, right?

293
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:26,475
Speaker 0: So it's it's really got a strong Potential to just blow everything else out and it's gonna.

294
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:32,937
Speaker 1: it's gonna be real interesting Of course sprint and I left sprint a long time ago for the equally bad Verizon.

295
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:37,899
Speaker 0: Yeah Verizon's a little better in some ways, but it's also worse in some ways.

296
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:44,648
Speaker 0: I mean sprint is like, you know, it really has the best pricing and plans $100 for unlimited everything plan.

297
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:45,330
Speaker 0: It's just.

298
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:53,060
Speaker 0: I guess it's alright, you know, but Their network, you know, I guess it's supposedly the fastest data network.

299
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,520
Speaker 0: But Verizon at least where we live has the strongest coverage, you know, wherever you go, you're gonna get some bars.

300
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,553
Speaker 0: I mean I got the AT&T and over here.

301
00:23:00,573 --> 00:23:01,559
Speaker 0: I don't get all these bars.

302
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,468
Speaker 1: but anyway time for things of the day.

303
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:30,820
Speaker 1: now we're talking all about free culture and free media and the thing like the Iconic kind of media of the modern internet generation is the mashup the creative cut, you know People always said yeah, the creative commons is great But like what can you really create that when you're just deriving or making derivative works of stuff that other people have made

304
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,184
Speaker 0: Too bad everything is derivative.

305
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:37,220
Speaker 1: Well, but even cave painting is derivative, but there are different degrees of derivative.

306
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,899
Speaker 1: There's a difference between writing like a relatively new story or a new take on the story versus writing bamlets.

307
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:46,128
Speaker 0: Bamlet it's bamlet.

308
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:50,300
Speaker 1: bamlet is about a man named bamlet whose father is murdered by his uncle.

309
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:54,654
Speaker 0: That's exactly the same as Hamlet only you changed one letter.

310
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:56,140
Speaker 1: there are degrees of derivation.

311
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:59,379
Speaker 1: The key is to make integrated works.

312
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:12,989
Speaker 1: but anyway I remember way back when Like people Creative Commons licenses were starting to be used more and more and people would argue that if you're just taking Like what's the point of having these share alike licenses?

313
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,840
Speaker 1: who's gonna take geek nights and remix it into techno or crap like that?

314
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:23,320
Speaker 1: Well, if you've never gotten how good a mashup can be Check out this video.

315
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:33,877
Speaker 1: this is just a mashup of like YouTube videos of people playing instruments and they make a Song that is better than a lot of commercial music out there that I've paid money for.

316
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:35,604
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just.

317
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:39,464
Speaker 1: it's fantastic and the visuals and I Really like this.

318
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:40,508
Speaker 1: this like this is fake.

319
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:41,231
Speaker 1: This is great.

320
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,680
Speaker 1: And I don't know what else I can say about it except that it's great.

321
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:44,419
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

322
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,226
Speaker 0: I just want to clarify one thing.

323
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:51,484
Speaker 0: is that the Cheryl the share alike clause on the Creative Commons licenses Specifically has.

324
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:57,660
Speaker 0: it has many uses but one specific use it has is it prevents people from DRM in your shit.

325
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,811
Speaker 0: It's like if we put out an episode of geek nights.

326
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:04,560
Speaker 0: if we have a share alike on there Then you could take geek nights and give it to your friends.

327
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:09,780
Speaker 0: But you could not take geek nights and put a DRM on it and then put it on your website.

328
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:10,604
Speaker 0: You couldn't do that.

329
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:14,280
Speaker 0: And if you like remixed geek nights, you couldn't put DRM on that either.

330
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:17,170
Speaker 0: Yep, so that's that's one thing the share alike does.

331
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,635
Speaker 0: that's that's a reason to have it.

332
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:26,208
Speaker 1: if you don't want people to DRM your Stuff, of course, that's also one thing that you know, there are a lot of different sides to the copyright argument But people don't.

333
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:43,145
Speaker 1: you can't forget that if you want Things like the Creative Commons license and all these sorts of ways of protecting your work or determining You know giving your work away with certain restrictions the Creative Commons and all these things rely Entirely on copyright law.

334
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:55,641
Speaker 1: you can't just get rid of copyright law because then you also get rid of all these sorts of free Share with other people like basically, you know since the what the Creative Commons shows right is a copyright law is insane Right.

335
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:58,090
Speaker 0: It basically means all rights reserved by default.

336
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:01,305
Speaker 0: So Creative Commons comes in and says, all right Well, you know what?

337
00:26:01,688 --> 00:26:03,220
Speaker 0: All rights are reserved by default.

338
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:09,020
Speaker 0: I will explicitly only reserve the rights that should be the only ones that are reserved by law.

339
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:11,358
Speaker 0: So basically you're you're getting rid of.

340
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,258
Speaker 0: you know You're basically getting rid of a bunch of rights so that it's the way it should be.

341
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:21,919
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind that the the only right you probably shouldn't be able to give up from a copyright or anything.

342
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,060
Speaker 1: any Creative work you've created are moral rights, but I figure everything else you should be able to give it up.

343
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:30,574
Speaker 1: You should be able to just Creative Commons free whatever but you know what.

344
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:35,674
Speaker 1: all that aside This this is pretty rockin and I highly recommend you check it out.

345
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:39,208
Speaker 0: All right, so lately Past, you know week or so.

346
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:40,814
Speaker 0: I've been not shit talking.

347
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:45,887
Speaker 0: I've been doing things right and I Was you know, there's a lot of that kind of.

348
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:53,500
Speaker 0: you know, do stuff crap all over the internet You know like to-do lists and the getting things done and all that kind of crap, right?

349
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,426
Speaker 0: But I came across this one and this one I think is uh is actually pretty nice You know, don't take this too seriously.

350
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,169
Speaker 0: It's just kind of.

351
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,754
Speaker 0: I just want to toss this out there.

352
00:27:02,774 --> 00:27:07,869
Speaker 0: This is the cult of done Manifesto, uh-huh, and they're there.

353
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:08,632
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read.

354
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,740
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read to you this manifesto, right?

355
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:12,186
Speaker 0: Give me a second.

356
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:21,213
Speaker 0: Okay, number one There are three stages of being not knowing action and completion Except that everything is a draft.

357
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:22,200
Speaker 0: It helps to get it done.

358
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:29,420
Speaker 0: Three there is no editing stage For pretending, you know, what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you're doing.

359
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,499
Speaker 0: So just accept that, you know what you're doing, even if you don't and do it.

360
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,226
Speaker 0: Five banished procrastination.

361
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,855
Speaker 0: if you wait more than a week to get an idea done abandon it.

362
00:27:38,317 --> 00:27:39,100
Speaker 0: I got that one, right?

363
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,359
Speaker 0: Six the point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.

364
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,968
Speaker 0: Seven once you're done, you can throw it away.

365
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,634
Speaker 0: eight laughs at perfection.

366
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:50,260
Speaker 0: It's boring and keeps you from being done.

367
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,569
Speaker 0: Nine people without dirty hands are wrong.

368
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:54,934
Speaker 0: doing something makes you right.

369
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:57,524
Speaker 0: I Like that one a lot.

370
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:59,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like people without dirty hands are wrong.

371
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,100
Speaker 0: doing something makes you right.

372
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,986
Speaker 0: I could talk for ten minutes just about that item.

373
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:05,374
Speaker 1: that feels a lot like one of them.

374
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:07,160
Speaker 1: one of the likes like a statement.

375
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,219
Speaker 1: That would be a burning wheel, you know.

376
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:12,740
Speaker 0: Well here let's talk about at least a little bit that particular item, right?

377
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:20,190
Speaker 0: So whenever you're like, you know having an argument with someone right, you know, let's say you're arguing with you Can't live ten Pokemon.

378
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,117
Speaker 1: I live ten Pokemon.

379
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,764
Speaker 0: Well Well, not even that.

380
00:28:23,844 --> 00:28:26,492
Speaker 0: but it's like, you know, let's say you're you're discussing.

381
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:29,460
Speaker 0: I don't know like, you know healthcare or something like that.

382
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,764
Speaker 0: it's like.

383
00:28:29,804 --> 00:28:37,571
Speaker 0: it's like well, I worked in a hospital or you know, I Well, I'm a doctor, you know, I did that.

384
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:38,435
Speaker 0: that is like that.

385
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:45,056
Speaker 0: that adds more, you know It really doesn't add that much weight because I can demonstrate lots of people who do things yet.

386
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:46,320
Speaker 0: No nothing about the thing they do.

387
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,664
Speaker 0: You know other tech people.

388
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:52,271
Speaker 0: but um, you know it really.

389
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,339
Speaker 0: it really helps you out in it especially arguing with people.

390
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,155
Speaker 0: anyway Ten failure counts is done.

391
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,000
Speaker 0: So do mistakes.

392
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,523
Speaker 0: Eleven destruction is a variant of done Twelve.

393
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:08,500
Speaker 0: if you have an idea and publish it on the internet that counts as a ghost of done.

394
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,160
Speaker 0: Thirteen done is the engine of more.

395
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,622
Speaker 0: so I Kind of like this.

396
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:18,207
Speaker 1: so they do stuff.

397
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,473
Speaker 0: Yes, you want to be done.

398
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:21,777
Speaker 0: Don't worry about making mistakes.

399
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:22,800
Speaker 0: Don't worry about perfection.

400
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:29,879
Speaker 1: It's like the nano remote, you know, just just write your novel you can fix it later whatever but just write it.

401
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything is a draft.

402
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:34,834
Speaker 0: Just fucking do do do do don't you know?

403
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:36,900
Speaker 0: slow down don't waste your time?

404
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:41,260
Speaker 0: You know don't you know, I guess you can write about your idea on the internet first.

405
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,079
Speaker 0: But that's just the ghost you actually had to do it.

406
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:45,041
Speaker 1: Well, you know Neil Gaiman even say, you know He always.

407
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:50,860
Speaker 1: he said that thing about how an idea is worth nothing because the implementation of an idea is the only thing that matters.

408
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,956
Speaker 1: Everyone has ideas, but no one acts on them.

409
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,597
Speaker 0: Yep And also it's either do or do do and also being able to act on them.

410
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:03,320
Speaker 0: Well, I mean You know any schmuck can come up with the idea for like the best novel ever.

411
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,506
Speaker 0: Can I schmuck actually write that best novel?

412
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:08,153
Speaker 0: No, so, you know Neil Gaiman is basically.

413
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:14,994
Speaker 0: that quote was when people were you know Submitting ideas for novels to him and he's basically like look your ideas are worth.

414
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:15,375
Speaker 0: Nothing.

415
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:16,740
Speaker 0: There's a million ideas.

416
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:21,740
Speaker 0: I'm the one who has the rare and valuable skill of being able to turn your idea into a best-selling book.

417
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,428
Speaker 0: Therefore your idea is worth nothing.

418
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,355
Speaker 0: you give me an idea and I turn it into a book.

419
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:27,037
Speaker 0: you get nothing.

420
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,586
Speaker 0: I get millions of dollars Because your idea is worthless.

421
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:33,378
Speaker 0: ideas are cheap and everyone has a million of them.

422
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:36,340
Speaker 1: so We're not gonna talk about this too long.

423
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Speaker 1: This is one of those like overview shows where we'll think of all the shows we might want to do about it in the future.

424
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,385
Speaker 1: But I was.

425
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,510
Speaker 0: it's one of those shows.

426
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,032
Speaker 0: we didn't have it.

427
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,237
Speaker 0: We couldn't come up with something.

428
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:45,940
Speaker 0: It's the last minute.

429
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:59,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but it's also it's on my mind lately because one of the projects I actually was just put at the head of at Work is that you know Financial firm and we have to have like disaster recovery like if New York City didn't exist tomorrow.

430
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:03,179
Speaker 1: We have to just come online and be doing business tomorrow like nothing happened.

431
00:31:04,004 --> 00:31:09,440
Speaker 1: So as a result, we have disaster recovery Like we have the ability to funk like every business process.

432
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,320
Speaker 1: We have has a complete backup in some other place and that that like disaster recovery alone.

433
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,000
Speaker 1: But we could do God we could do months and months and months and shows of how to do disaster recovery.

434
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:25,120
Speaker 1: That's like one of the biggest ITCS things out there, but we're not talking about disaster recovery.

435
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:43,075
Speaker 1: But the project I'm heading up is this really small thing and the idea is that we're trying to test how well our disaster recovery works in a real-world situation and We figured out the best way to do this is to have everyone important at the company work from home one day a month and try to do their entire job from home.

436
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,117
Speaker 1: and Because I'm in charge of this it means I'm gonna be able to Telecommute a little bit as I test all these different things.

437
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:51,560
Speaker 1: and you know what?

438
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,100
Speaker 1: Telecommuting is the holy goddamn grail of tech workers.

439
00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:03,307
Speaker 1: It is like we want nothing more than to be able to work from home because as Scott can tell you I would just

440
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:10,359
Speaker 0: go just buy a cheap gigantic house in the middle of fuck nowhere where there's internet like on the farthest away I could be and still get Internet's.

441
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,557
Speaker 0: and You know I try to make the company pay for that Internet's and get like a t1 to the house.

442
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:22,269
Speaker 1: because Especially for CS people like Scott like people who are writing code You don't need to be anywhere.

443
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,339
Speaker 1: people give you requirements and code comes out.

444
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know I get requests sometimes.

445
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,792
Speaker 0: so if you could just call me on the phone I mean, there's no there's no real reason.

446
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:35,699
Speaker 0: I need to physically be there and I'm so excited about this.

447
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,720
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna get to work from home at least once a month to start and then we'll see where this goes.

448
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:44,100
Speaker 0: But yeah, yeah, so anyway the thing about working from home, right?

449
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,227
Speaker 0: Technologically speaking right is you?

450
00:32:47,548 --> 00:33:15,759
Speaker 0: you have this person who does work and most of their work the vast majority of it is Computer related right some of it will be telephone work some of it might even be paper work But it most of it is computer work And that means you need to somehow get their computer in their house on their normal mundane consumer internet On to the business network as so that it is as if they are sitting at their desk at work.

451
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:26,936
Speaker 0: and Technologically speaking that is not very easy to do and it is much more difficult to do securely Than it is to do it all.

452
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:35,200
Speaker 1: but Technologically like we're at a point where it's never been easier to work from home at least for tech workers.

453
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:45,252
Speaker 1: Well most tech workers, I mean like if you're say you're doing like support like you answer the phones There's really no reason for you to be in an office If all you do is answer phones and take support call the

454
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,798
Speaker 0: reason is to someone keep keep an

455
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:47,320
Speaker 1: eye on you.

456
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,677
Speaker 1: Well, that's the problem the fundamental thing that's holding back the like work from home of revolution.

457
00:33:53,697 --> 00:34:00,260
Speaker 1: and I say revolution Not lightly because I feel like in a lot of ways it would be a major societal revolution.

458
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:15,380
Speaker 1: Well, I think if people who don't need to physically commute could work from home And we'd kind of come back to it's like we go back to cottage industry, but it's not really cottage industry It's just you're doing, you know modern integrated work, but you're doing it remotely.

459
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:20,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean people talk about like oh if we only had mass transit, right?

460
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,380
Speaker 0: What?

461
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,370
Speaker 0: what if just no one had to get in their car at all?

462
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:24,723
Speaker 0: think about it telling me that be even better We wouldn't?

463
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,900
Speaker 1: you know the commuting is teleporting.

464
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:31,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, you teleport to work you teleport home and you can make your own sandwich from your own fridge.

465
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:36,260
Speaker 0: Yep It's definitely I think, you know, definitely a way to go.

466
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,373
Speaker 0: The thing is is that I think there's just a lot of job, you know There's plenty of telecommuters out there, right?

467
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,099
Speaker 0: These people do exist There's plenty of them.

468
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:49,458
Speaker 0: But I think that there are a huge number of jobs that could be telecommuting and just aren't.

469
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,672
Speaker 1: Now at the same time there are definitely mostly cubicle people there are.

470
00:34:53,752 --> 00:35:01,740
Speaker 1: there are a lot of jobs that can't really you can't Telecommute and even jobs that seem like you could telecommute if you actually telecommuted full-time.

471
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:03,912
Speaker 1: It would probably break down.

472
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:11,520
Speaker 1: if for nothing else than that There is a certain power to presence and to getting together and I think I did get together once a week.

473
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,140
Speaker 0: You know get together when there's a meeting but when there's not a meeting you don't have to be here.

474
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:24,800
Speaker 1: Well, the interesting thing is that more technological people and younger generations who are used to this I think are more and more able to get stuff done without having to meet in person.

475
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,278
Speaker 1: I mean like all the younger tech people at my like where I work right now.

476
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:30,924
Speaker 1: We use the internal company.

477
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,209
Speaker 1: I am all the time like my.

478
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,629
Speaker 1: my boss will say hey call so-and-so and sort out this thing And I'll just be typing.

479
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,300
Speaker 1: and he was like, hey, did you call so-and-so yet?

480
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,851
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, I already worked it out and I am yeah.

481
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:42,860
Speaker 0: Well here think about this scenario, right?

482
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,560
Speaker 0: Here's a here's an example of a job that can't telecommute right the desktop support guy.

483
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,090
Speaker 0: Sometimes he's got to go plug in a monitor.

484
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,400
Speaker 0: Sometimes he's got to go switch a video card, right?

485
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,528
Speaker 0: That guy needs to be there, right?

486
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:55,110
Speaker 1: Yep.

487
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,460
Speaker 0: But what if everyone else is telecommuting?

488
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:04,500
Speaker 0: Well, then you don't need that guy right because there's no desktops in the office But then you have desktops at home your desktops at home.

489
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,360
Speaker 0: So, how do you get this guy to go to everyone's house?

490
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Speaker 0: Which is all over the place if they need desktop support at their house?

491
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,400
Speaker 1: Now the answer is if you're working with technological people you don't you know because they can take care of themselves.

492
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,780
Speaker 0: But what if you send like all your phone salespeople home to telecommute and then you give them all laptops, right?

493
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:24,582
Speaker 0: What happens?

494
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:27,591
Speaker 0: those laptops actually break hardware wise.

495
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:29,035
Speaker 0: they got to mail it back.

496
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:31,162
Speaker 1: you mail them a new one with well You know what?

497
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:31,683
Speaker 1: Yes.

498
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:33,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you start.

499
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:36,460
Speaker 0: those are the kind of problems that will sort of come out at you.

500
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're all solvable.

501
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,345
Speaker 0: No, they are but they're not.

502
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:42,553
Speaker 0: they're not optimal, you know, it's some are.

503
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:44,760
Speaker 0: it really depends always a trade-off somewhere.

504
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,771
Speaker 1: I guess I feel like right now like as of today March 9th, you know 2009.

505
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:48,971
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

506
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:52,681
Speaker 1: It's almost 2010.

507
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:55,851
Speaker 1: Yep, the 90s were like 20 years ago.

508
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:56,974
Speaker 1: Well the early 90s.

509
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:57,596
Speaker 0: Yep.

510
00:36:57,937 --> 00:36:58,318
Speaker 1: Yeah.

511
00:36:58,418 --> 00:36:59,060
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

512
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:09,488
Speaker 1: Anyway, if I'm just suddenly feeling really old because I think back to 1990 and it feels like it wasn't that long ago Then I think about what the world was like in 1990 or eight.

513
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:11,013
Speaker 1: I was eight.

514
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:12,657
Speaker 1: there weren't cell phones.

515
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:16,347
Speaker 0: Nope Anyway, there weren't even super intendos.

516
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:17,471
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

517
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:18,595
Speaker 0: Maybe there were.

518
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:19,117
Speaker 0: it was.

519
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,086
Speaker 1: it was close Eight nine, I didn't.

520
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:39,960
Speaker 1: I don't think there were superintendent anyway, I'm not gonna look that up but I feel like right now Telecommuting for highly skilled technological people who don't need to physically work on physical bits Not only is possible and perhaps trivial but should be encouraged.

521
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:55,819
Speaker 1: However, I feel like the best way to go about it Absolutely is that say like you're in a position like me like you do primarily like support and computer work and Everything you do is like with a computer and you don't really have to physically interact with anything just with people.

522
00:37:57,161 --> 00:38:00,800
Speaker 1: What if you just telecommute every Friday or every Thursday or once a week?

523
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,760
Speaker 1: So you're still in the office getting all that interaction and you're still getting out of the house.

524
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:06,219
Speaker 1: You don't turn into like a hikikomori.

525
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,687
Speaker 1: I mean, I've known people who like telecommuted and they like stop going outside Yeah, they stop getting dressed.

526
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:17,080
Speaker 0: that's definitely a problem that can happen and it's purely a psychological thing.

527
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:37,520
Speaker 1: But I mean like if I if I when I tell the commute now like I've done it once or twice But if if I'm staying at home, like I'll still like get up and shower and shave and like a dress But if I was telecommuting every day I would probably start waking up later and later and I'd probably just stop shaving And I'd probably stop getting out about like I'd wake up and put on clean pajamas and then move

528
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:40,642
Speaker 0: When I actually felt nasty You

529
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:41,625
Speaker 1: know and that.

530
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:46,780
Speaker 1: and then you start to I don't know you start to blur the work-life boundary unless you're really disciplined.

531
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:50,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I don't know what to do about that.

532
00:38:51,150 --> 00:39:00,680
Speaker 1: yeah, well, I think the best way and I feel like Anyone who's a highly skilled technical worker should lobby for telecommuting if you think your job and get away with it.

533
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:09,460
Speaker 1: and I think the way to sell it is to offer to do it one day a month and Even offer to make it not be Mondays or Fridays.

534
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:13,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that way you could just you know, you'd be able to just in those days.

535
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:20,710
Speaker 0: You would like work extra hard and you would even you know Like work from the time your commute would steer.

536
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:26,513
Speaker 0: regular commute would start to the time you would get home Right, and then it's you know, that way you're not.

537
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:32,559
Speaker 0: you're working actually more time But you're you know away from you know, quote away from home for more time, right?

538
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:40,129
Speaker 0: For the same amount of time and you're sort of demonstrating to them like look I'm you're getting just as much out of me here.

539
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:41,312
Speaker 0: is there if not more?

540
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:44,582
Speaker 0: so there's no there's no reason to make me come Into the office.

541
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:49,820
Speaker 0: and in fact, you know, if you let me move farther away, I can get a bigger house for less money.

542
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:58,347
Speaker 0: You know in this bad real estate market You'll you'll get even you know more work for the same amount of money and I'll get more for my money and it works out for everybody.

543
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:04,200
Speaker 1: well plus I feel like Even if you just like say you did it once a month like one day a month is your telecommuting day.

544
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:05,508
Speaker 1: It's not a vacation day.

545
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:07,560
Speaker 1: Like you still have to work then you're still gonna get stuff done.

546
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:19,239
Speaker 1: But I feel like and it's been my experience with other like working places where other people telecommuted People who have even like that little telecommute like once a month are a thousand times happier at their jobs.

547
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:21,871
Speaker 0: Mmm, because I mean how many I mean you're all.

548
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:23,560
Speaker 1: a lot of you are tech people are going into tech.

549
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:28,440
Speaker 1: How many of you are like sitting at work for like an hour at the end of a day?

550
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,540
Speaker 1: Where you have no more work to do or you're just like your brains fried.

551
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:37,300
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get anything else done, but you can't just leave you have to stay there and like pretend to work for another couple

552
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:47,199
Speaker 0: hours, well, I think you know telecommuting really in that sense is Not so much different from you know the flex time thing right and it goes back into the.

553
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:53,540
Speaker 0: Why do so many employers feel the need to sort of force you to be there from X hour to X hour?

554
00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:03,088
Speaker 0: Should they not instead just force you to get X work done by X deadline and not care how many hours you're in the office and what telecommuting does?

555
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:13,174
Speaker 0: is it sort of circumvents the employer who demands certain hours and Instead, you know allows you to have flex time even if you don't have it?

556
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:15,603
Speaker 0: because if you're at home You know.

557
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:18,174
Speaker 0: if you're at work and you only have five hours of work.

558
00:41:18,195 --> 00:41:20,591
Speaker 0: We had to sit there for eight hours That's three hours.

559
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:35,960
Speaker 0: You're going to Right If you have a flex time, you can just leave three hours early, but if you're at home You know, you're basically you can work your five hours You get all the same amount of work done throughout the day and you'll just three hours during the day.

560
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,571
Speaker 0: Sometimes you'll just be doing something else at home.

561
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:49,720
Speaker 0: You'll actually be you know, you'll be able to do your laundry or something Whereas if you're at work those three hours, all you can really do is read slashdot or play solitaire or some play a flash game.

562
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:51,525
Speaker 0: You can't do anything.

563
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:55,399
Speaker 1: and I just I feel like it makes people happier and I'd get more work done.

564
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:56,385
Speaker 1: and Really?

565
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:57,776
Speaker 1: It still depends on the job.

566
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:03,507
Speaker 1: like Person - I mean part of the reason you work you know the eight-hour schedule is depending on.

567
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:06,658
Speaker 1: are they keeping you there because they don't know better?

568
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:08,566
Speaker 1: because you know, That's the hours.

569
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:10,033
Speaker 1: Everyone works and they just expect it.

570
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:11,520
Speaker 1: or are they keeping you there?

571
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,820
Speaker 1: Not because you might not have enough work to do but they're paying you the money.

572
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,845
Speaker 1: They're paying you because they're.

573
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,540
Speaker 1: you're available for when they need you.

574
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,951
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, for example at my work, right?

575
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:32,820
Speaker 0: I could be sitting there for like three hours But then like at four thirty, they'll be like I need you to do this thing Like right now, you know at any time they could just be like someone could need something from me or like me.

576
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:35,702
Speaker 1: The stock market is open from 930 to 4.

577
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:41,740
Speaker 1: They're paying me to be there from 930 to 4 to make sure stuff doesn't catch on fire while the stock markets open.

578
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,707
Speaker 1: I can't like flex time.

579
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:48,519
Speaker 1: that I can't be like, yeah, I only have two hours of support work to do So I'll do it on Wednesday.

580
00:42:50,642 --> 00:42:51,258
Speaker 0: That's good stuff.

581
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, do you want to talk about some of the telecommute technologies?

582
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,639
Speaker 1: I think we should because I have it on because I'm actually I'm on support this week Like I'm the go-to guy.

583
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:07,588
Speaker 1: So right now like, you know, my desk has this gigantic desk in my in like in the geek night studio Which is not a normal sized desk.

584
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:09,154
Speaker 1: It's it's pretty gigantic.

585
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:10,699
Speaker 0: It's not even as big as my desk at work.

586
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:15,375
Speaker 1: Well, you have an unnecessarily large desk at work because they fired everybody.

587
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:16,380
Speaker 0: What do you want from me?

588
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:17,783
Speaker 0: I had this.

589
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:20,152
Speaker 0: I had an even larger desk before they fired everyone.

590
00:43:20,454 --> 00:43:23,428
Speaker 0: my desk at work before they fired Everyone had a mini fridge on it.

591
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:24,514
Speaker 1: What's even scarier?

592
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:25,439
Speaker 1: Is that when I worked at IBM?

593
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:28,020
Speaker 1: I had an office just because there were extra offices.

594
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:39,668
Speaker 1: Wow And you have to be a certain like band level like there's rules like you have to be level 8 to get a shared But if you're level 9 You're allowed to have an office to yourself.

595
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:44,769
Speaker 1: and we kind of got around all that because we're in this like if I went like We're on the third floor, right?

596
00:43:45,151 --> 00:43:46,420
Speaker 1: The second floor was identical.

597
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:53,036
Speaker 1: Sometimes I'd get off on the second floor by accident off the elevator and I'd walk over to my office and that whole floor was like empty.

598
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:55,707
Speaker 1: So I'd go to like this empty office.

599
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:58,539
Speaker 1: I'd be like, oh wait and I go back and go up a floor.

600
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:00,526
Speaker 1: It was kind of cool.

601
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:06,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, so the first thing right is You mean blackberries?

602
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:11,360
Speaker 0: I don't know if we should consider, you know, like cell phones and things part of telecommuting work from home.

603
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:12,373
Speaker 1: That's your available.

604
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:12,860
Speaker 1: That's a different.

605
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:23,818
Speaker 0: So, I mean the first thing right is you need like the full-on Work telephone and you know that the the cell phone really doesn't suffice, you know You need to be able to like, you know pick up on.

606
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:25,105
Speaker 0: you know multiple lines.

607
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:29,263
Speaker 0: if you have multiple lives need to be able to transfer and Conference right.

608
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:34,480
Speaker 0: and even if you have like a super work connected blackberry, it really doesn't cut it.

609
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like what my company did I mean just cuz I've got all this on my desk.

610
00:44:37,738 --> 00:44:39,867
Speaker 1: right now I'm looking at my Avaya IP phone.

611
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:40,189
Speaker 1: It's just.

612
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,100
Speaker 1: it's a real big telephone with the screen out and everything.

613
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,058
Speaker 1: It's like a normal phone.

614
00:44:44,322 --> 00:44:46,500
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah before VoIP you really couldn't do that.

615
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,620
Speaker 0: You would have had to like buy a phone line and then they would have to use like some crazy PBX shit, right?

616
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,803
Speaker 0: But now with VoIP like call forwarding and all this like yeah rigmarole with VoIP IP phones It's real easy.

617
00:44:58,884 --> 00:45:01,212
Speaker 0: Just you know, you get a phone uses sip.

618
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:03,540
Speaker 0: it connects to your works PBX.

619
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,680
Speaker 1: Right now I've got a phone on my desk and it's connected to my work office.

620
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:13,960
Speaker 0: It's set to do not disturb because I'm like But it's exactly the same as if you had a phone on your desk in the office.

621
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,184
Speaker 1: like literally it ring.

622
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:19,337
Speaker 1: like if someone calls the support line it rings the same time as the other phones in.

623
00:45:19,377 --> 00:45:22,467
Speaker 1: like my office I Work ring and I can just answer the phone conference.

624
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:24,053
Speaker 1: I have my three phone lines in it.

625
00:45:24,534 --> 00:45:26,200
Speaker 1: It's encrypted VPN and all that.

626
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:26,814
Speaker 1: it just works.

627
00:45:26,855 --> 00:45:30,814
Speaker 1: so Being at home is no different than being in the office in terms of dealing with.

628
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,367
Speaker 0: the thing is a lot of companies You know, they have VoIP now.

629
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,700
Speaker 0: It's I mean the last two places I've worked have had VoIP.

630
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,990
Speaker 0: You know one place switched to it.

631
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:38,300
Speaker 0: The other place had it when I got there.

632
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:50,040
Speaker 0: Some people like that outsource it to someone else or they set it up poorly and it's a lot of people don't have it Set up right and it's always problematic or tricky or their network is screwy.

633
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,894
Speaker 0: So like VoIP works fine in the office be taken home and odds a big mess.

634
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:54,114
Speaker 0: now

635
00:45:54,155 --> 00:46:02,328
Speaker 1: the answer to that is Straight up is either be willing to pay the exorbitant amount of money to have an outside firm that's competent do it

636
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,539
Speaker 0: or have smart people or

637
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:10,533
Speaker 1: Be willing to invest in the people you have To train them to manage it internally because

638
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:12,561
Speaker 0: hire someone who knows that it's a pastor but

639
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:14,168
Speaker 1: that's still that's still an investment.

640
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:20,395
Speaker 1: the idea is that either pay what it costs or Pay what it costs to invest in local talent to do it.

641
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:23,700
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Don't try to cheapskate around it or it's gonna suck.

642
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:23,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz

643
00:46:24,021 --> 00:47:07,863
Speaker 0: I mean, you know even today when the Internet's taken over and phones are sort of going down Really pretty much almost any office, you know phones are like absolutely necessary and mission critical no matter what and you really You know if your phone the more your phones can do for you, you know, the awesome are your businesses, you know if you don't need to like use some weird service to do a conference and if you don't need to You know, yeah, if you have trouble like doing transfers or stuff like that That's really gonna hurt your business in the long run Constant daily frustrations and you know the money you pay for a phone system that works perfectly and has all these features really helps you And people being able to work from home and have a phone that works exactly the same as the one on their desk Perfectly

644
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:09,269
Speaker 1: not even just for telecommuting.

645
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:11,700
Speaker 1: but imagine like there's a crazy blizzard.

646
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:18,480
Speaker 1: Well, alright, if I can't get into work, I'm screwed or I can just work from home because I mean how many people right?

647
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,869
Speaker 0: I mean people at my work do this.

648
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:23,591
Speaker 0: They'll be like, yeah, I'm working from home today There's a crazy the track transit screwed up.

649
00:47:23,651 --> 00:47:26,786
Speaker 0: or yeah, I got to work from home today But they don't really work from home.

650
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:32,420
Speaker 0: work from home means don't take don't lose a day of you know Personal day or vacation day, but stay home.

651
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,243
Speaker 0: That's what it means.

652
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:35,391
Speaker 1: now the other the other phone.

653
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:36,837
Speaker 0: you can stop people from doing that.

654
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:37,339
Speaker 0: you call them up.

655
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:42,600
Speaker 1: Also on my desk right here is the work laptop and I feel like you can do it on your home computer.

656
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:43,859
Speaker 1: You just VPNs and all that.

657
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,291
Speaker 1: But really the best way.

658
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:51,640
Speaker 1: if you're a company you want people to telecommute Buy them laptops and give them to them and tell them to take them home.

659
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:53,687
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I mean that's that's a huge problem.

660
00:47:53,848 --> 00:47:57,140
Speaker 0: is that if you let people VPN with their own equipment, right?

661
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,270
Speaker 0: I mean it works.

662
00:47:58,412 --> 00:48:07,460
Speaker 0: it can be done but it's such an extra chore for the IT people because a you have to support these people installing this crapping and Fingering it on their own machines.

663
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,480
Speaker 0: You have no idea what their machines are and to you got this whole security risk of all these.

664
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:14,673
Speaker 0: You know, who knows what machines getting on your network?

665
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:15,760
Speaker 0: You don't want that shit on there.

666
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,289
Speaker 1: I mean I have the ability.

667
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:24,972
Speaker 1: I use my laptop and my work laptop Like both of them are allowed to get into the corporate network because they know I'm not an idiot Yep, and you do it yourself.

668
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:26,000
Speaker 0: They don't have to help you do it.

669
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:31,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I installed the Cisco VPN client and I just connect in but it like, you know someone else.

670
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:33,230
Speaker 0: You can't just let them bring in that like.

671
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:38,100
Speaker 1: I'll give you the example using my laptop Like I can like find like out skiing or something.

672
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,679
Speaker 1: I have a laptop with me and there's like an emergency and they need me like they blackberry me.

673
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:50,639
Speaker 1: I can take my laptop and the Verizon card and I can use like the outlook web access to check my email and I can like I can putty and X win and get into the stuff I need to get into.

674
00:48:50,699 --> 00:49:02,659
Speaker 1: but The work laptop has just outlook installed on it and it's already on the domain at work Like I can just authenticate like normal and I can just like exactly the same as sitting at your desk at work.

675
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:05,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing is it's not a portable like.

676
00:49:05,552 --> 00:49:07,380
Speaker 1: it's not a fancy laptop like my laptop.

677
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,660
Speaker 1: I don't carry this work laptop around like I don't carry it in my bag.

678
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,340
Speaker 1: It's a big like giant powerful laptop, but I leave it on my desk at home.

679
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:14,601
Speaker 1: So

680
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:23,093
Speaker 0: the only reason it really needs to be a laptop is so that you can carry it home and then carry it back to Work, they can't like give you a desktop to carry home and right

681
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:31,552
Speaker 1: like when I travel for business I bring my laptop on the plane and I put my work laptop in the luggage Because I'm gonna turn the work laptop on in the hotel room.

682
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:32,758
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna use it like on the go.

683
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:35,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, the battery on the thing only lasts like two hours.

684
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:36,760
Speaker 1: It's like the mid-range day.

685
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,754
Speaker 0: It's not you know giving someone a laptop because you want it to be portable that they should carry it everywhere with them.

686
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:47,940
Speaker 0: you're giving it to them because a Laptop is able to be carried home and then you know, it's one thing, you know, it's a lot less chance.

687
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,414
Speaker 0: It's some way, you know, no one has to hook anything up.

688
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:55,320
Speaker 0: It's a lot easier to support It's a lot easier to have them give it back to you if they quit or something.

689
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:01,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean support like imagine trying to support me if like I have a problem connecting with my laptop.

690
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,624
Speaker 1: There'll be a million things.

691
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:03,127
Speaker 1: I'm admin.

692
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:04,251
Speaker 1: I could have done whatever I wanted.

693
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:17,580
Speaker 1: I could have installed a stupid firewall, whatever The work laptop, especially if you use like enterprise or not even enterprise, but just like desktop management software You can push the updates and manage the box remotely, you know group policy Active Directory all that stuff.

694
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,894
Speaker 0: Plus you buy a bunch of uniform laptops, right?

695
00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:28,040
Speaker 1: You know, they all have the exact Yeah, and if someone's laptop breaks you just ship them a new one, you know Like same day and tell them to mail the old one back and just you know image it.

696
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it's a desktop and a monitor and a mouse and a keyboard forget about it.

697
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:38,990
Speaker 1: It's way too much I guess just the moral is don't underestimate The benefit of having a dedicated separate work laptop.

698
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:46,672
Speaker 1: or if you're like a consultant or like you work from home for a living Have a separate work computer even if you own both like.

699
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:52,319
Speaker 1: having the separate computer in the separate monitor Goes like just as someone who works from home a lot.

700
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:56,793
Speaker 1: It goes a long way toward enforcing the discipline of work.

701
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:57,676
Speaker 1: is work time.

702
00:50:57,997 --> 00:51:00,486
Speaker 1: play is play time Like I get a lot.

703
00:51:00,546 --> 00:51:11,084
Speaker 0: I mean at the very least, you know whether using Linux or Windows You can have separate accounts to log into that, you know, you log in to the work account, you know and then you're.

704
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:18,429
Speaker 0: you know, the work user on your machine has totally different stuff from your regular user and Therefore, you know, you can't be like going to click on like.

705
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:21,560
Speaker 0: there won't be an icon for steam there.

706
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:22,985
Speaker 0: You know, this is the work account.

707
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:25,855
Speaker 0: It has an icon for the VPN and the whatever.

708
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:26,858
Speaker 0: whatever, you know the other worksheet.

709
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,883
Speaker 0: You're out your excels and your whatever you use and I don't know People.

710
00:51:32,445 --> 00:51:32,666
Speaker 1: yeah.

711
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:34,613
Speaker 1: Yeah plus all the work software.

712
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,520
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not gonna own a copy of Visio.

713
00:51:36,922 --> 00:51:39,500
Speaker 1: I would never buy Visio, but I need Visio for work.

714
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,812
Speaker 1: I need it a lot and you know what cuz I have the work laptop.

715
00:51:42,294 --> 00:51:42,898
Speaker 1: I've got Visio.

716
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:48,440
Speaker 1: Yes And I've got distiller and I've got all those things I need, you know managing licenses, right?

717
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,142
Speaker 0: You're a company.

718
00:51:49,162 --> 00:51:52,575
Speaker 0: you bought a hundred copies of Microsoft Office or you have a you know, whatever.

719
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:53,820
Speaker 0: you can't you know.

720
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,000
Speaker 0: Let's say someone you know wants to work from home on their own computer.

721
00:51:57,341 --> 00:51:59,049
Speaker 0: You can't just give them Microsoft Office.

722
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:00,295
Speaker 0: What if they didn't buy it now?

723
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:01,440
Speaker 0: You got you got some trouble.

724
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:02,979
Speaker 0: They don't even have Outlook, right?

725
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:03,982
Speaker 0: So you get you.

726
00:52:04,062 --> 00:52:04,504
Speaker 0: you got.

727
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:11,520
Speaker 0: it's pretty it's a lot of license trouble to get them a copy of office to install on their Machine legitimately and track those licenses, right?

728
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:19,420
Speaker 0: But the work laptop allows you to manage your licenses, you know much more easily than letting people telecommute with their own hardware.

729
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,409
Speaker 1: So I think that's enough for now.

730
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:24,580
Speaker 1: I think that's a good overview of our feelings on this.

731
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:28,640
Speaker 1: I feel like we could do a show on disaster recovery at some point in the future.

732
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:35,531
Speaker 1: I feel like we could do a show on like the actual tech of telecommuting or like the actual Societal things about telling you ever

733
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:36,719
Speaker 0: done a show and just like VPNs

734
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:46,502
Speaker 1: I don't know if we haven't we should next because that's an easy topic that a lot of people would do well to understand because VPNs you can

735
00:52:46,522 --> 00:52:49,813
Speaker 0: talk about VPNs not only connecting to work but connecting to your house also

736
00:52:49,893 --> 00:53:02,210
Speaker 1: or even things that serve similar purposes like The humble SSH tunnel has like salt like that solves more problems than you can possibly imagine Unless you're someone like us who uses them all the time.

737
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:07,150
Speaker 1: I know right like every problem I have It's like well, I'll just SSH tunnel it and then it's fine.

738
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:09,280
Speaker 0: Well you think about that, right?

739
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,660
Speaker 0: It's like there's basically saying the problem doesn't exist because I know the solution.

740
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:19,230
Speaker 1: Yes, but but at the same time if you don't know that is the solution Firewalls be tricky to set up.

741
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:19,935
