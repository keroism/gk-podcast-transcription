1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:20,730
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, November 13th, Dateline November 1st, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight, the Burning Con 2012.

2
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,727
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,360
Speaker 0: Shows up a little bit late, Scott was too much of a wuss to bike through the hurricane to come over to the studio to do Geek Nights.

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, listen, you know.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,080
Speaker 0: I was out biking both those days, and running.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,040
Speaker 1: Uh, listen, you have hair warming your head.

7
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:42,660
Speaker 0: There's things called hats, in fact it's Tuesday, Team Fortress 2 might have taught you about them if you didn't know otherwise.

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,764
Speaker 1: Do you own any hats?

9
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,960
Speaker 1: that also, that go underneath helmets in a safe fashion?

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,020
Speaker 0: They make a couple of different kinds of hats that do that.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,879
Speaker 1: How much do those cost?

12
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:51,595
Speaker 1: I don't know.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, I went to REI.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,180
Speaker 1: You could just not wear a helmet.

15
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:56,139
Speaker 1: And also EMS.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,480
Speaker 0: Just put on a knit hat instead.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,399
Speaker 1: And I was looking at the prices on equipment that would allow me to bike, see I don't want to bike in the snow, even though I looked into that too, you can get studded tires.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,880
Speaker 0: No, it sucks.

19
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 0: It sucks.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,259
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,659
Speaker 0: Never, ever bike in the snow.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Speaker 1: If you had the right kind of bike.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,519
Speaker 0: No, it's still not fun.

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,760
Speaker 0: I've had the right kind of bike.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,240
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,660
Speaker 1: I don't want to bike in the rain or snow.

27
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:14,960
Speaker 1: I mean, for no other reason.

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,120
Speaker 1: At least I've biked a lot.

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,078
Speaker 0: You okay with sleet?

30
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:19,040
Speaker 1: In any sort of precipitation.

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,720
Speaker 0: Dark of night?

32
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,919
Speaker 1: Especially not hail.

33
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:30,400
Speaker 1: Uh, cause I have biked in the rain, and even though it's perfectly fine in a lot of ways, the mere fact, even if you have a fender, you're gonna get water spraying up on you.

34
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,780
Speaker 1: Oh no, you're gonna look like shit when you get wherever you're going.

35
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,100
Speaker 1: Alright, so whatever you're wearing is ruined if you have to bike in the rain.

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,020
Speaker 1: So, uh, I don't want to do that, but I thought, hey, I do want to bike no matter how cold it is, even if it's like below zero.

37
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:44,940
Speaker 0: So get a nice warm helmet.

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,660
Speaker 1: I should be able to bike if it is not raining or snowing or precipitating.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,720
Speaker 0: You could just not wear a helmet.

40
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:51,020
Speaker 0: I often don't wear a helmet.

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,601
Speaker 0: So

42
00:01:51,742 --> 00:02:02,859
Speaker 1: I went and I looked at the equipment, well, even if you don't wear a helmet, there's still the issue of, you know, the part of your body covered in coats will melt cause you're sweating in it and the part of your body that is exposed will freeze cause there's wind blowing

43
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:02,919
Speaker 0: on.

44
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:05,740
Speaker 0: You have a really terrible coat.

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,139
Speaker 1: You gotta go and get specialized coats that is made for this.

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,559
Speaker 0: All the stuff I use for skiing.

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

48
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:20,380
Speaker 1: So I went to REI EMS and investigated the situation to see what kind of equipment I could get that would allow this sort of activity.

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,720
Speaker 1: And they had some of that equipment and that equipment was horrendously expensive.

50
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,140
Speaker 0: I don't recall it being that expensive.

51
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,164
Speaker 1: Oh, Mr.

52
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:33,400
Speaker 1: Vice President doesn't think a five hundred dollar coat is expensive.

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,339
Speaker 0: I spent three eighty on my jacket.

54
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,033
Speaker 1: That is more than hundreds.

55
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,960
Speaker 0: That ski jacket is going to last me another 15 hundreds now.

56
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:46,659
Speaker 1: And that's just the jacket we're talking about.

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,760
Speaker 0: We're not even started talking about a jacket that expensive for what you're doing.

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,398
Speaker 1: We're talking about the under clothes too.

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,820
Speaker 1: Well, remember, this is retail price in Manhattan.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
Speaker 0: Get some like stupid Uniqlo Heat Tech T-shirts.

61
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,759
Speaker 0: They work great and they're like 15 bucks.

62
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:00,704
Speaker 1: Yeah.

63
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,639
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was looking a lot of this stuff.

64
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:09,144
Speaker 1: And to buy enough to wear every day to go to work all the time would add up to many hundreds.

65
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,780
Speaker 0: Or you could just not care and show up to work looking like whatever.

66
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:15,660
Speaker 1: Or I could just not bike when it's fucking cold out.

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,223
Speaker 0: That sucks.

68
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,599
Speaker 1: It doesn't suck too bad.

69
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,079
Speaker 1: Anyway, no frostbite here.

70
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,485
Speaker 1: Pretty good.

71
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,080
Speaker 0: The only time pretty good.

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,057
Speaker 0: Almost got frostbite when I was hiking out in the woods and the blizzard got lost, fell through a creek and my boot broke.

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,340
Speaker 1: I'm scoring 100 percent on the no frostbite scale.

74
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,120
Speaker 0: OK, but I did go biking yesterday.

75
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,399
Speaker 0: But anyway, this episode is a little bit late.

76
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,437
Speaker 0: As I said, Dateline November 1st.

77
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,300
Speaker 0: But we missed Tuesday's show due to various reasons we just discussed.

78
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:53,445
Speaker 0: So this isn't actually going up for all a week and a half from when we're recording this.

79
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,056
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

80
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:59,419
Speaker 0: So Tuesday, I heard a game came out, heard a couple of games came out.

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

82
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,280
Speaker 1: After waiting for over a decade, perhaps.

83
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:04,963
Speaker 1: Yes.

84
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,302
Speaker 1: Longer than longer than the Team Fortress 2.

85
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,840
Speaker 0: I waited longer for Team Fortress 2.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:20,480
Speaker 1: Well, we haven't really, you know, I've been waiting so long because this one is, you know, unlike, say, Duke Nukem Forever, Duke Nukem Forever, it would be like there'd be some screenshots and there'd be nothing.

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Speaker 1: There'd be E3, there'd be nothing.

88
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:27,919
Speaker 1: And then it kept coming and disappearing, coming and disappearing and appearing and reappearing and then disappearing for long periods of time.

89
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:40,863
Speaker 1: This game has appeared and stayed, appeared without disappearing, you know, with with relatively frequent, you know, news updates and no black holes or mysteries for about a decade.

90
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,100
Speaker 1: And now it is out.

91
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:46,500
Speaker 0: I have the fancy black armor because I gave them forty dollars.

92
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,300
Speaker 1: It is 100 percent out natural selection, too.

93
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,359
Speaker 1: And actually, I haven't played it in months.

94
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,786
Speaker 0: Neither have I.

95
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,040
Speaker 1: But I'm busy on other things.

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,260
Speaker 0: I haven't even played Counter-Strike.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,288
Speaker 1: Me either.

99
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:00,139
Speaker 0: I wonder why.

100
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,479
Speaker 0: We'll talk about it in weeks.

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,260
Speaker 0: We'll talk in the meta why that is.

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,418
Speaker 0: But yeah, we haven't played NS2.

103
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,082
Speaker 0: But you know what?

104
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,337
Speaker 0: Every time I played it had been a market improvement.

105
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:09,826
Speaker 0: over the previous time I'd played it.

106
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,820
Speaker 1: Now it has like mechs and shit.

107
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Speaker 1: And wow, man, it's off the hook.

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,680
Speaker 1: It was several months ago and apparently all kinds of network issues are fixed.

109
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,497
Speaker 0: It reached the point where it was actually at that point more fun than the original NS, which took a while to get to.

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:23,982
Speaker 0: I don't know.

111
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,569
Speaker 1: Well, it was.

112
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,919
Speaker 1: it was equal ish, different but equal ish.

113
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, different.

114
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,780
Speaker 0: But it was more fun to play, partly just because a lot more people.

115
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,720
Speaker 0: It was easier to get a game going.

116
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,060
Speaker 0: There's other factors there.

117
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,580
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd still be playing weapons factory, but you know what?

118
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,084
Speaker 0: There's no goddamn way to play weapons factory, except with nut jobs who were so much better than me.

119
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:42,838
Speaker 0: It wouldn't even matter.

120
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,360
Speaker 0: Be like if chess were a forgotten art and I wanted to play.

121
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:57,744
Speaker 1: Well, only the hardcore crazy dude, if everyone else, if everyone else on Earth forgot chess, but me, I could be the best because I'd still remember the rules and I played it more times.

122
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,740
Speaker 0: And that might not actually be to your advantage.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,379
Speaker 0: And to you and I should play Bobby Fischer chess because that eliminates all opening study as a factor.

124
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:11,016
Speaker 0: You know, Bobby Fischer chess, that's how you know what it's in that book.

125
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,424
Speaker 0: that wouldn't matter what you should be.

126
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:16,006
Speaker 1: that wouldn't matter to me because I've never learned any of the chess openings.

127
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:18,340
Speaker 0: I have learned three to a reasonable degree.

128
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:25,780
Speaker 0: I am partial to the Polish opening, but everyone good I've ever played with told me I'm stupid for using it and I don't understand it well enough to understand why.

129
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,999
Speaker 0: But yeah, do you know what Bobby Fischer chess is?

130
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,619
Speaker 1: It's something where you shuffle up all the pieces.

131
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,495
Speaker 0: No, you shuffle the back row only.

132
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,200
Speaker 0: So that row is just randomized and equivalent on both sides.

133
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,120
Speaker 1: Well, shuffling up the front row wouldn't really do much.

134
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,420
Speaker 0: But you can shuffle up everything.

135
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,719
Speaker 0: So maybe there's a pawn in the back.

136
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:51,039
Speaker 1: We kind of I'd like that, but then upon would not be able to do shit if it was caught behind the scenes, can barely do shit in the front.

137
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:59,320
Speaker 0: I've also realized that most people I've known in my life, like everyone who's a gamer, seems to know the rules of chess and that they know how the pieces move.

138
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,501
Speaker 0: But I'm starting to realize that most people I know don't actually know all the rules of chess.

139
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,100
Speaker 0: They cannot describe how castling works, nor have they ever heard of all.

140
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:16,857
Speaker 1: If they're OK, so castling is when the rook and the the king, right, are sort of don't have anything in between them.

141
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:17,722
Speaker 1: Right.

142
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:18,083
Speaker 1: Yeah.

143
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:25,159
Speaker 1: In which case, then you move the rook two spaces to the right and then you move the king to the other side of the rook, like jumps over him.

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,804
Speaker 0: All right.

145
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:26,375
Speaker 0: Here's the trick.

146
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:26,620
Speaker 1: That's it.

147
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,579
Speaker 1: That's all the castle is.

148
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,939
Speaker 0: Can you castle if the rook had moved out of that position and later returned to it?

149
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:36,056
Speaker 1: I have no idea, but I will guess no.

150
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:41,000
Speaker 0: So more important, not more important because it never happens, but more crazy.

151
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,780
Speaker 1: Can you castle if the king moved out of the position to move back into it?

152
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,020
Speaker 0: I'm looking up because I actually remember.

153
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,801
Speaker 1: Right.

154
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,514
Speaker 0: But the thing is, castling never comes up among.

155
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:49,680
Speaker 0: it's weird.

156
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,260
Speaker 1: Like, do you really do pros ever castle?

157
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,480
Speaker 0: So from what I gather, yes.

158
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:02,881
Speaker 0: What I've noticed and I read an article about this, really inexperienced players castle way more often than anyone, because if they know about the rule existing, you got to try it.

159
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,559
Speaker 0: They go for it because it seems cool.

160
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,379
Speaker 1: Of course, wouldn't you?

161
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,240
Speaker 1: That's the reason that you buy all the weird buildings in Calus.

162
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:14,171
Speaker 0: But en passant is the rule that I think most people who play chess in the world have never heard of.

163
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:20,039
Speaker 1: Isn't that the one where like all the pawns are lined up against each other so you can kill the pawn in a weird way?

164
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:29,991
Speaker 0: It has to do with the fact that way back in the day, you know, there's no original rules of chess, really, but basically there was no move upon two spaces at the beginning of the game rule.

165
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:30,420
Speaker 0: Right.

166
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,445
Speaker 0: So the game took longer.

167
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:36,599
Speaker 0: So eventually this was kind of a house rule where you could say, all right, you can move upon forward twice.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,280
Speaker 0: But again, around the fact that that could actually change the game.

169
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:52,239
Speaker 0: If upon moved to and there was another pawn like in front of it, it can move at an angle to where the pawn would have been if that rule weren't in place and capture it like that instead of landing directly on it.

170
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:53,904
Speaker 0: That's it.

171
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,420
Speaker 0: I don't think that comes up much in professional play, if at all.

172
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,159
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about really professional chess.

173
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:00,780
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know the opening.

174
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,681
Speaker 0: I'm pretty shit at chess, partly because I studied those openings, but I don't really play.

175
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,700
Speaker 1: I recall like the few very few times you played chess.

176
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,459
Speaker 1: I've actually won despite not knowing anything except the rules and how to move guys.

177
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:19,500
Speaker 0: Ah, castling is important goal in early parts of chess, according to Wikipedia.

178
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:20,623
Speaker 1: OK.

179
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:22,620
Speaker 0: Good.

180
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,181
Speaker 0: OK.

181
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,475
Speaker 0: Anyway, so another game is to do you shave.

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,960
Speaker 1: You really haven't bought it already.

183
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,499
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell is wrong with you or what podcast you've been listening to.

184
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,367
Speaker 1: But really, we're talking.

185
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:39,158
Speaker 1: if you're the kind of person who is dying in Counter-Strike all the time, maybe you don't like it.

186
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,340
Speaker 1: I mean, really, you know, and sometimes you're not in the Counter-Strike mood.

187
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,900
Speaker 1: Sometimes you need something a little different.

188
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:52,120
Speaker 1: You should really have Counter-Strike go and NS2 and that will pretty much satisfy all of your multiplayer team based FPS needs for the rest of your life.

189
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,540
Speaker 0: There was a time in my life when I would play Counter-Strike until I was sick of it and then I would just immediately play NS until I was sick of it.

190
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Speaker 1: And go back to Counter-Strike.

191
00:09:59,660 --> 00:09:59,983
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

192
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:00,306
Speaker 1: Right.

193
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:01,660
Speaker 1: So just have those two games.

194
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,479
Speaker 1: If you have any two games on Steam, have those two.

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,260
Speaker 1: And really, dude, I mean, you could almost argue you don't need any other games except maybe Super Metroid and Mega Man 2.

196
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't really need FTL, but it's good.

197
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,009
Speaker 0: I need FTL.

198
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,738
Speaker 0: I really like FTL.

199
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:21,200
Speaker 0: I look forward to some sort of expansion or versus version.

200
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,803
Speaker 1: Well, let's just say this a year from now, FTL play not going to get so many hours a year from now.

201
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:29,439
Speaker 1: And as to in Counter-Strike, still going to get clicked on.

202
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,640
Speaker 0: But they're different classes of game entirely.

203
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,894
Speaker 0: I'm just saying these games have their own like these are.

204
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:36,120
Speaker 1: these are life games.

205
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,940
Speaker 1: These aren't those games where you buy them, play them and put them away.

206
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,400
Speaker 1: These are life games.

207
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,366
Speaker 1: There's only two of them.

208
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:43,220
Speaker 1: One of them just came out.

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,843
Speaker 1: This is a big deal.

210
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:47,441
Speaker 0: Castling is permissible if and only if the following conditions still hold.

211
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:47,944
Speaker 0: Here we go.

212
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:52,920
Speaker 0: One, the king has not previously moved up to the chosen rock has not previously moved up.

213
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,686
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that's that.

214
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:54,595
Speaker 0: I guess so.

215
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,643
Speaker 1: I guessed right.

216
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,939
Speaker 0: Three, there are no pieces between the king and the chosen rock for the king is not currently in check.

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
Speaker 0: Five, the king does not pass through a square that is under attack.

218
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
Speaker 1: You can't do it when you're in check.

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:04,641
Speaker 0: No.

220
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,619
Speaker 1: Oh, but that's like the best time when you'd want to do it.

221
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:09,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's bullshit.

222
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,600
Speaker 0: The king does not pass through a square that is under attack by enemy pieces.

223
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,160
Speaker 0: Six, the king does not end up in does not pass through a square that is under attack.

224
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,503
Speaker 1: So if one of the spaces between the king and the rook could be hit by, say, a knight, you can't castle.

225
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:25,708
Speaker 0: Oh, it's.

226
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:28,864
Speaker 0: that's very similar to the opposite rule that it prevents you from.

227
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,800
Speaker 0: you know, you get this extra move to speed up the game.

228
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,140
Speaker 1: But what are these rules of chess?

229
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,580
Speaker 1: I didn't know that are bullshit.

230
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:36,460
Speaker 0: Six, the king does not end up in check, which I guess is a rule.

231
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,999
Speaker 1: That would be funny if you did that.

232
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,980
Speaker 1: You're fucking stupid.

233
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:40,580
Speaker 1: OK, go seven.

234
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,319
Speaker 0: The king and the chosen rook are on the same rank.

235
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:46,428
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

236
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:47,578
Speaker 1: So you can.

237
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:49,139
Speaker 1: What do you mean on the same rank?

238
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,082
Speaker 0: The row.

239
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:54,375
Speaker 1: So you can actually move them both forward and then do it.

240
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,819
Speaker 1: I don't understand that part, because then they would have moved, which would have invalidated the first thing.

241
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:01,842
Speaker 1: Right.

242
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:06,415
Speaker 1: I mean, you can only do it in the back row from their starting positions when neither of them have moved.

243
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:06,699
Speaker 1: Right.

244
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,439
Speaker 1: So how could they not be on the same rank?

245
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:15,220
Speaker 1: I don't know, actually, that's a really that's a redundant rule.

246
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,459
Speaker 0: Here's a handbook.

247
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,999
Speaker 1: A handbook all about just castling, and that's it?

248
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:26,140
Speaker 0: I will continue to investigate this later, because the point I was making wasn't that I'm so smart and everyone else doesn't know chess.

249
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,039
Speaker 1: Well, you're clearly not that smart if you had to read Wikipedia to know this.

250
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,540
Speaker 1: But I'm saying that you're no smarter than me.

251
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,437
Speaker 0: Gamer nerds, I found, don't actually know chess.

252
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:33,840
Speaker 0: that well.

253
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,724
Speaker 0: And it's not.

254
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,380
Speaker 0: chess is not popular among gamers.

255
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,340
Speaker 0: And people who like chess do not like other games.

256
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 1: It's because there is a chess community and in fact, the Go community sort of also to some extent doesn't cross over with the rest of the gaming community.

257
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
Speaker 1: It's like the gaming community is super inclusive.

258
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,239
Speaker 1: We'll have you chess people, we'll have you go people, but they don't want us.

259
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,339
Speaker 1: They don't want to hang out with us.

260
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 1: Puerto Rico players and us, you know, power grid players, they just want to stay all by themselves like their game is its own thing.

261
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:09,260
Speaker 1: And I guess by having their game be its own thing, does it make them feel so how their game is above all other?

262
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,020
Speaker 0: So this is a roundabout way of once again recommending Richard Garfield's book because he talks about that and he equates chess to Counter-Strike in this regard.

263
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,100
Speaker 0: And he makes some very good points.

264
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,200
Speaker 0: I finished chapter one.

265
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,019
Speaker 1: I'm in chapter two.

266
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,160
Speaker 1: I read the whole section about heuristics just recently.

267
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:30,240
Speaker 0: Isn't that the directional heuristics versus positional heuristics?

268
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:38,250
Speaker 1: No, just how gamers use heuristics and how nubs can't really figure out any, you know, especially in a game.

269
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:38,980
Speaker 1: No one gives a bad.

270
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:48,480
Speaker 0: So we have terms for this, but basically his terms are a directional heuristic is a heuristic you have that tells you or helps you decide what move to make.

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,519
Speaker 1: That's the ones I use most often.

272
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,799
Speaker 0: And a positional heuristic tells you who's winning.

273
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,460
Speaker 0: That's the part that everyone who plays games with me fucks up.

274
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,446
Speaker 0: They think that because they're in the front in Mario Kart, that they're somehow in first place.

275
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:00,752
Speaker 0: Right.

276
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:01,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

277
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,053
Speaker 1: The directional heuristic is in power grid when I'm counting how much money I can bid on power plant.

278
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:07,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

279
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,059
Speaker 1: How much I have to save for the reason.

280
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,849
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the positional heuristic is, well, am I going to be in first or last and who's actually winning?

281
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:14,819
Speaker 0: Watch out for rim.

282
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,543
Speaker 1: Watch out for him.

283
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:19,439
Speaker 1: That's the only one you need.

284
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:22,259
Speaker 0: So many of our friends were from games.

285
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,163
Speaker 0: And, you know, we talked about this before, but Guns of Icarus online actually finally came out.

286
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,559
Speaker 1: Why so many games come out?

287
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,200
Speaker 1: Who has money or time?

288
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,480
Speaker 0: And I've been working from home all week because of the hurricane.

289
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:37,100
Speaker 0: So I've been playing a bunch of these games.

290
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,360
Speaker 0: I got to say, I played Guns of Icarus a bunch during the beta.

291
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,122
Speaker 0: It was pretty fun.

292
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:46,027
Speaker 0: It's like to imagine two on two like ships versus and your man and guns and run around like each team.

293
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:48,320
Speaker 0: It's ship has a captain and you can target.

294
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,370
Speaker 1: But there's no boarding.

295
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:50,320
Speaker 1: You can't board the other.

296
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,260
Speaker 0: Wait, I heard there was going to be boarding.

297
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,063
Speaker 1: No, there's not.

298
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:59,500
Speaker 0: In fact, I heard I heard a very, very credible rumor that there will, in fact, be boarding and Guns of Icarus online.

299
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:03,460
Speaker 0: I have a reliable source to be that hard is Emily's yelling.

300
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,679
Speaker 0: Fuck you from the other room.

301
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,816
Speaker 1: I don't know why it wouldn't be that hard to do would I think?

302
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:08,400
Speaker 0: I know why.

303
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,650
Speaker 1: Do you know why you got to work?

304
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:10,699
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

305
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,490
Speaker 0: It's so easy.

306
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,099
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

307
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,662
Speaker 1: All you got to do.

308
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:16,780
Speaker 1: I mean, every FPS in the world, you jump from one platform to another.

309
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,586
Speaker 1: This ship is a no.

310
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,140
Speaker 0: It's not the game part of it.

311
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,768
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

312
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:20,700
Speaker 1: Ship is a platform.

313
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:21,850
Speaker 1: You jump now.

314
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,040
Speaker 1: You just press spacebar.

315
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,642
Speaker 1: He jumps.

316
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:27,040
Speaker 1: If there's another ship under your feet when you land, then you are.

317
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,290
Speaker 0: Have you ever written anything?

318
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,480
Speaker 0: Have you ever done anything in unity?

319
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:30,403
Speaker 1: No.

320
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:36,279
Speaker 0: So it's highly likely that player entities are tied to ship entities or something like that or two teams.

321
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:40,440
Speaker 0: So they're not independent objects that can interact completely independently.

322
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,360
Speaker 1: It's not just a floating platform.

323
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,022
Speaker 1: No, because it sounds like somebody didn't think about that in the beginning or they did.

324
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:55,200
Speaker 0: I would make a secondary argument that from a play perspective, how many games do you play that at a first person perspective in melee combat?

325
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,400
Speaker 1: Who says has to be melee combat?

326
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,245
Speaker 0: All right.

327
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,759
Speaker 0: So I jump onto the enemy ship and there's a dude there.

328
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,158
Speaker 1: We can shoot him.

329
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:03,342
Speaker 0: OK.

330
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:11,739
Speaker 1: In a world, the most basic thing in a first person shooter, you have a gun and you're pointing at someone and you go bang, the simplest possible thing.

331
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,820
Speaker 0: But it's a world where not everybody has these handheld guns.

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,559
Speaker 0: As far as I can tell, the only guns are giant ship mounted guns.

333
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:19,284
Speaker 1: Maybe they should.

334
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:22,420
Speaker 1: It's not that hard to add a handgun to an FPS.

335
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:26,439
Speaker 1: That is the most baby FPS tutorial thing to do.

336
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:31,160
Speaker 0: But it messes up the kind of rhythm of the game because that is a serious problem.

337
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,428
Speaker 0: Think about what happens.

338
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,900
Speaker 1: That is a very serious problem.

339
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,029
Speaker 1: One guy's on your ship.

340
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,259
Speaker 1: You're trying to fly it.

341
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,980
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, he's really good at FPS.

342
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,599
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it goes around your ship killing you all the time.

343
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,028
Speaker 0: Exactly.

344
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:41,360
Speaker 0: I was ready.

345
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,499
Speaker 1: You respawn on this flying boat.

346
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,838
Speaker 1: Do you respawn on it?

347
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,520
Speaker 1: So I was going to just steal your boat.

348
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,242
Speaker 1: Can he pile?

349
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:53,976
Speaker 1: Can he use the guns on your boat to shoot at your, you know, in disguise to shoot at the friendly boat?

350
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:59,660
Speaker 1: Them thinking it's a friend, but really it's a bad guy got on there and killed everybody from boarding.

351
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:10,819
Speaker 1: So what this basically comes down to is we did that lecture and then there'll be no reason to use the big boats because someone would just steal them with their skills and jump off the tiny boat and just board the big.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,190
Speaker 0: So, Scott, maybe you get around that by doing a Team Fortress 2 thing and gimping the FPS part, but then it's not nearly as fun as people like.

353
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,380
Speaker 1: there is a huge game, completely broken flaw if you allow the boarding.

354
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:36,099
Speaker 0: So what I'm getting at is that we talked about that concept of like in mega, mega, mega factory, mega TF or weapons factory, how one asshole who's just better at head clicking than everyone else literally can dominate an entire team.

355
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,464
Speaker 1: Indeed.

356
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:40,620
Speaker 0: So you're going to get to a chapter that talks about the same thing.

357
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,020
Speaker 0: It's like factors of play.

358
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:46,440
Speaker 0: So like if I'm playing Puerto Rico, actually, he used some other game as an example.

359
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,389
Speaker 0: Hearts was the example.

360
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:48,077
Speaker 0: He's like one.

361
00:17:48,480 --> 00:18:02,047
Speaker 0: If I use zero factors or zero heuristics, I'm playing randomly, if I use one heuristic paying attention to how many hearts are in my hand, suddenly I have a much higher chance of winning.

362
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:02,920
Speaker 1: Really?

363
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,359
Speaker 0: Say I use another additional heuristic paying attention to whether or not the Queen of Spades have been played yet.

364
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,720
Speaker 0: That's another huge advantage for relatively little effort.

365
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,040
Speaker 0: Let's say now also I use a third one.

366
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,920
Speaker 0: I also keep track of the king and ace of spades.

367
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:21,360
Speaker 0: Not as much of a return, not as common to pay out, but gives me a higher chance of winning, just less of one.

368
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,299
Speaker 1: Well, I pay attention to them if I fucking have them.

369
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,219
Speaker 1: So get rid of their asses.

370
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,920
Speaker 0: So as you keep applying, what if I start counting cards like count the number of hearts played by anyone, count the number of points taken by anyone.

371
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:40,420
Speaker 0: Every factor I add, every like thing or skill I use takes additional effort and gives me an additional chance of winning.

372
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,460
Speaker 0: But there is a diminishing return.

373
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:47,298
Speaker 1: What if you're playing hearts and you have the queen, king and ace of spades all in your hand all at once?

374
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,100
Speaker 0: Ah, usually if that's the case, it depends.

375
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,420
Speaker 0: Do I have any other spades in my hand?

376
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:57,080
Speaker 1: Well, the only really hope you have is if you can get rid of another suit very quickly and then play all three of those.

377
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,440
Speaker 0: See, this is we think we think about hearts on very different levels.

378
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,300
Speaker 0: I have two questions in that situation.

379
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,080
Speaker 0: One, do I have three questions?

380
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,320
Speaker 0: One, do I have any other spades?

381
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,222
Speaker 0: And if so, how many?

382
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:11,559
Speaker 0: Two, is the person I am giving cards to an idiot or not?

383
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:17,240
Speaker 0: And three, am I low on a suit that is not spades or hearts?

384
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're low on a suit that's not spades, you can just play.

385
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,999
Speaker 1: You can just empty your hand of that suit and then hope someone else plays that suit, allowing you to dump all there.

386
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,600
Speaker 0: Now, I would not do that if I had the queen and a small number of spades.

387
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,960
Speaker 1: Well, you only really need to not have the ace in the game.

388
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,620
Speaker 1: You only need to dump the queen.

389
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
Speaker 1: You can dump the other ones later.

390
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,402
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

391
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:40,200
Speaker 0: The thing is, if I have the queen having the ace is great and the king is great.

392
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:40,744
Speaker 0: You know why?

393
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,095
Speaker 0: Shooting moons?

394
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:44,451
Speaker 0: No.

395
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:45,380
Speaker 0: I rarely shoot the moon.

396
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:54,100
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it'd be really easy to shoot the moon because, you know, when you play the queen, there's no chance of someone else being forced to take it by, you know, having the king or ace be the only card remaining in their hand.

397
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,737
Speaker 0: I would disagree because usually I don't shoot the moon that early.

398
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,210
Speaker 0: By the time it's at the point where someone gives me the queen, it's usually not apparent that I'm shooting the moon yet.

399
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker 0: It just looks like I'm sucking.

400
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:19,837
Speaker 0: But no, it's because if I have the king and the ace or at least one of them and someone else is trying to force me to queen myself by playing low spades, I can take the trick with the ace or king, maybe take a hard if I'm forced to, and then

401
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:20,802
Speaker 1: switch it up to something

402
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:23,360
Speaker 0: and leave with something else and delay the inevitable fucking that I'm about

403
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:25,271
Speaker 1: to get.

404
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,880
Speaker 1: But you're only delaying the inevitable.

405
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:27,992
Speaker 1: You're going to get 13 points.

406
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,765
Speaker 0: Well, this comes down to an interesting quirk of game theory among a wide spread of players.

407
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,000
Speaker 0: Stuff like that works really well.

408
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,960
Speaker 0: If I just play perfectly optimally and conservatively, there's a chance other people will fuck up and I'm very likely to win.

409
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,828
Speaker 1: I always play hard.

410
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:42,880
Speaker 1: It's 100 percent conservative.

411
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,120
Speaker 0: If four skilled players play hard conservatively, it's random.

412
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:51,540
Speaker 0: So instead, you can only augment your chance of winning by playing aggressively.

413
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:57,103
Speaker 1: The original point with the boarding was simply that this is another case of the counter strike.

414
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,694
Speaker 1: Everyone says remove the AWP.

415
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:01,400
Speaker 1: Everyone says add boarding.

416
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:02,667
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

417
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:03,979
Speaker 1: You'll mess the game up like tribes do.

418
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,259
Speaker 0: Yo, dogs, game design, wah, complicated deaths.

419
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:08,158
Speaker 1: That's right.

420
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:15,790
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

421
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:22,650
Speaker 0: So in gaming, as you all know, especially people who played games with me before, I'm a huge fan of the trash talking.

422
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:34,943
Speaker 0: No, I mean, back at RIT, we used to always do the trash talk Mario Tennis Tournament where you were obligated to trash talk the other team while you played and you were graded on your trash talking independently of the tennis match

423
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,213
Speaker 1: is one that is the best trash talk.

424
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:42,753
Speaker 0: Trash talking is also a difficult subject because, for example, that is the poo noise.

425
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,930
Speaker 0: Some people enjoy trash, the noise of victory.

426
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:54,230
Speaker 0: But if there is someone who can't deal with trash talk in your group and they want to play a game, if you trash talk, don't be friends with them, you make them feel bad.

427
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,133
Speaker 1: Don't be friends with them.

428
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:59,312
Speaker 0: If you don't trash talk them, you make them feel equally bad.

429
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:04,110
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is a video of what can happen.

430
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,529
Speaker 0: You see, there are two important kinds of trash talk backed up and not backed up or pre hoc and post.

431
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,770
Speaker 1: Those are the same kind.

432
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,269
Speaker 0: I am a fan of the post hoc trash talk that is rims.

433
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,070
Speaker 0: I will be very quiet during the game until my victory is assured.

434
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,250
Speaker 0: And the more likely it is that I'm going to win, the more I ramp it the fuck up.

435
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,250
Speaker 1: See, I'm the pre hoc nature.

436
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:26,775
Speaker 1: Right.

437
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,129
Speaker 1: And that is the pre hoc.

438
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,650
Speaker 1: See, I view post hoc trash talk is sort of invalid trash talk.

439
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,410
Speaker 1: It's like you've already won and now you're talking shit.

440
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:37,370
Speaker 1: Oh, you're so brave to talk shit after you.

441
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,130
Speaker 1: It's like you beat your ass and you beat a guy up.

442
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,090
Speaker 1: He's bleeding on the floor and then you start talking.

443
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,549
Speaker 1: It's like what kind of what kind of pussy are you?

444
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:45,871
Speaker 1: Right.

445
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:59,150
Speaker 1: A real man, someone who is, you know, and I don't mean the gender man and just mean someone who is who is brave and awesome at gaming will trash talk and hype themselves up before the challenge.

446
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:01,990
Speaker 1: That is to say, I'm about to kick your ass.

447
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can take you.

448
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,579
Speaker 0: See, here's the problem.

449
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,970
Speaker 0: You use the pre hoc too much.

450
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:14,110
Speaker 1: So when you because if sometimes I go in sometimes I go in with the pre hoc and say, bring it, and then they bring it and I get my ass kicked.

451
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,470
Speaker 0: See, if I trash talk after the fact and I lost, well, that just means I'm stupid.

452
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:26,290
Speaker 0: But if I trash talk before and I lose, I have lost doubly, which is why my pre hoc trash talk is very rare.

453
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,871
Speaker 0: But when I bring it, usually all I do is I just do the Babe Ruth point right before the game.

454
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:34,930
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I win more often than not.

455
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,253
Speaker 1: So except that's not true pre hoc talking like the pre hoc talking I just did one sentence.

456
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,170
Speaker 0: I will be I'm Babe Ruth thing.

457
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:47,890
Speaker 0: I will beat you in the next competitive ortho game that you and I play together.

458
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,290
Speaker 1: Whoever's name is Scott wins.

459
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:52,350
Speaker 0: I didn't agree to play that game.

460
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,024
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

461
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:53,187
Speaker 1: I won.

462
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,850
Speaker 0: I will win the next ortho game that you and I play.

463
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,511
Speaker 1: Sure.

464
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:59,369
Speaker 0: Did you get to the part of the book where he says what an ortho game is?

465
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:00,035
Speaker 0: OK.

466
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:00,562
Speaker 0: Chapter one.

467
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,615
Speaker 1: I told you.

468
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:02,990
Speaker 0: I forget where that is.

469
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,069
Speaker 0: It was a while ago when I read it.

470
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:13,050
Speaker 1: So how does this trash talk discussion relate to a video from a fight as in people punching each other and it won't do which fighting sport is it?

471
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,875
Speaker 1: Is it boxing?

472
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,989
Speaker 1: Is it punk craze?

473
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,876
Speaker 1: Is it what is it?

474
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:18,308
Speaker 0: It's boxing esque.

475
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:28,910
Speaker 0: OK, but basically one dude is way cocky and the other guy punches him a whole bunch and he basically just doesn't even defend himself and walks over like, what, what, what?

476
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:29,938
Speaker 0: Bring it, bring it.

477
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:30,890
Speaker 0: And the other guy brings it.

478
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,554
Speaker 0: And that's the end.

479
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:32,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

480
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:33,810
Speaker 0: it's a beautiful thing.

481
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:34,894
Speaker 0: To behold.

482
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:38,249
Speaker 0: And it has the tags, ouch, fail, fights, fighting and cocky.

483
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:40,410
Speaker 1: OK, so check this out.

484
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,690
Speaker 1: There's a game coming out called Apotheon or Apotheon or whatever.

485
00:24:46,190 --> 00:25:00,010
Speaker 1: And this game, from all intents and purposes in the video that you look at here, seems to be a completely average platforming combat ish kind of game where you jump and throw spears and block things with a shield and that sort of thing.

486
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,069
Speaker 1: Not too much exciting is going on here.

487
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:04,648
Speaker 1: 2D platformer.

488
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,813
Speaker 1: It seems like it's going to be on Steam on Windows and then maybe other platforms later, whatever.

489
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:26,050
Speaker 1: But the stylings, the visual aesthetic stylings of this game are looking like one of my favorite stylings, the ancient Greek stylings that you love, nothing more than depictions of old Greek men.

490
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,150
Speaker 1: There are things I love more, but I love this a lot.

491
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:35,558
Speaker 1: So it looks like, you know, your dude has like the shield with the snake on it, the big circle shield.

492
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,789
Speaker 1: He throws a spear.

493
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,150
Speaker 1: Everything's orange and black and white.

494
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,913
Speaker 1: And you have those little sort of square spiral things going on on the borders of the terrain.

495
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:51,890
Speaker 1: And you fight like, you know, it's pretty much like you're looking in the in the Greek history section of the museum and it's come to life.

496
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:52,949
Speaker 1: And that's the video game.

497
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:58,790
Speaker 1: So this video is pretty much all you need from this game, since it looks to be a pretty boring game, you don't need to actually play.

498
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:05,101
Speaker 1: Maybe it'll be really cheap on Steam one day, but because it's pretty tight, if you like that sort of game.

499
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:05,630
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

500
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,810
Speaker 1: But because the styling is so good, the video promoting the game is thing of the day worthy and hence it is my thing.

501
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,889
Speaker 0: It looks exactly like the art on the sides of Amphora.

502
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:16,695
Speaker 1: Yes.

503
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:17,850
Speaker 1: My favorite kind.

504
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:18,548
Speaker 0: You mean carrots?

505
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:19,855
Speaker 1: Yeah.

506
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:21,289
Speaker 0: I wonder if anyone will get that.

507
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,567
Speaker 1: Nobody will get that.

508
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:29,670
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, the book club book is still the name of the win by Patrick Rothfuss.

509
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:31,728
Speaker 0: I'm most of the way through it.

510
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:32,873
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

511
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:39,269
Speaker 0: But the only complaint I have is that it was just rocking through scenes and drama and everything really great.

512
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,131
Speaker 0: I have one on one kind of complicated complaint that I'm going to say for the book club show.

513
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:48,510
Speaker 0: But he's been in the school for a long time and the school isn't short.

514
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,570
Speaker 1: How long were you in school?

515
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:54,490
Speaker 0: But the school, the school boy drama is just the same bullshit.

516
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,647
Speaker 0: The jackass guy keeps being a jackass.

517
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,223
Speaker 1: How long were you in school for?

518
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:01,510
Speaker 0: Well, the wizard school, five years.

519
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,394
Speaker 1: Right.

520
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,310
Speaker 1: So how many years has he been in the wizard school?

521
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,630
Speaker 0: I don't need every detail.

522
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:09,069
Speaker 1: How how many years have you been reading this book?

523
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,970
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that's a lot less than it takes.

524
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,850
Speaker 0: I don't think most of what happened to him in school is all that important.

525
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,709
Speaker 1: Well, finish the book and then we'll do an episode and we can discuss this again.

526
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:19,814
Speaker 0: I mean, I get it.

527
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:26,110
Speaker 0: He's the Kellis Mary Sue Golden Child of the world, the smartest, that's the best person that's ever born.

528
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,189
Speaker 1: But isn't that the book I always say I want to read?

529
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,228
Speaker 0: Well, now you get it.

530
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,426
Speaker 1: We always end up reading a book about like, you know, freakin who?

531
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,752
Speaker 0: Kellis?

532
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:36,609
Speaker 1: Kind of.

533
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:37,133
Speaker 1: Right.

534
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:39,610
Speaker 1: But how come we don't get to read a book about Seswatha?

535
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,268
Speaker 0: We're going to get to, I think.

536
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,570
Speaker 1: Or Kelmomas.

537
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:46,390
Speaker 0: In fact, I think things are repeating and you get the same story told again.

538
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:49,008
Speaker 0: Maybe that book's coming out soon.

539
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:54,670
Speaker 1: And how come, you know, we get this story about like, oh, Sauron, right.

540
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:01,650
Speaker 1: But if you want the real story, you got to read the Silmarillion, which is not as boring as far as only because it was a mishmash of a whole bunch of shit.

541
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,450
Speaker 1: We could have gotten the real story of, you know, the nine kings and whatnot.

542
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,174
Speaker 1: Right.

543
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:08,830
Speaker 1: But yeah, we didn't get that thing.

544
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,975
Speaker 0: Is that plays out like.

545
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:15,509
Speaker 0: instead we get a story like the same burning wheel game you play, except everyone's white instead of black.

546
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,770
Speaker 1: So instead we get a story about like, yeah, those kings.

547
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, here's some statues of them.

548
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,970
Speaker 1: It's like, no, tell me the story about the king who was so awesome that they made a giant statue of him pointing.

549
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:26,939
Speaker 1: King.

550
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,010
Speaker 1: That's who I want to hear about.

551
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,369
Speaker 1: I don't want to hear about some fucking hobbits.

552
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,850
Speaker 0: King Awesome did a W seven wound to the beast as opposed to a B seven wound.

553
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,653
Speaker 1: I love that shit.

554
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:37,203
Speaker 1: Hook me up where who tell me?

555
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:39,451
Speaker 1: anyone who reads a lot of fantasy novels.

556
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,159
Speaker 1: Alex, where is the?

557
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,810
Speaker 1: where is the fantasy novel that is about the great?

558
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,910
Speaker 1: I guess Earthsea is about the great wizard, right, of all time.

559
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even in Earthsea, there was a past, you know, time that is alluded to where dragons were all over the fuck.

560
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:54,292
Speaker 1: Right.

561
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:57,270
Speaker 1: Where is the story about the time when dragons were just all over the fuck?

562
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,370
Speaker 0: Hopefully we'll get a flashback to Star Swirl.

563
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,193
Speaker 1: And like there.

564
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:00,394
Speaker 1: Yeah.

565
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:03,146
Speaker 1: And there weren't any amazing castles yet.

566
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,030
Speaker 1: because guess what?

567
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,490
Speaker 1: The great king built the fucking castle.

568
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:07,553
Speaker 1: Right.

569
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:12,850
Speaker 0: You're going to be real disappointed when that king built the castle upon the ruins of the even greater, older castle.

570
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,290
Speaker 1: No, I want to hear the story of the greatest, oldest castle.

571
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,053
Speaker 0: You know what?

572
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:18,389
Speaker 0: It's castles all the way down.

573
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,929
Speaker 1: It's not castles all the way down.

574
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,150
Speaker 1: There is a pre castle era.

575
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,829
Speaker 0: Are you giving me some castle trash talk?

576
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,788
Speaker 1: In which case it was not a castle, but a hut.

577
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,630
Speaker 0: You're going pre castle now or a, you know, a mead hall.

578
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:36,530
Speaker 1: So, uh, magfest, we're going, we're going to, that's a while from now.

579
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,890
Speaker 0: We're probably going to be doing a revamped version of losing should be fun.

580
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,150
Speaker 0: And we will probably be on one or two of the gaming intellectuals things.

581
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:45,249
Speaker 0: We're still working on the details.

582
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,470
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess anime Boston.

583
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,036
Speaker 1: Whoa.

584
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:50,589
Speaker 1: Future.

585
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,233
Speaker 0: Yeah.

586
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:51,990
Speaker 0: Connecticut.

587
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,109
Speaker 1: PAX East, PAX OSS.

588
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:54,974
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

589
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,030
Speaker 0: And PAX OSS is sold out of three day badges.

590
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,810
Speaker 0: So if you didn't buy them, that's a shame.

591
00:29:58,952 --> 00:29:59,970
Speaker 0: You've learned your lesson.

592
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,510
Speaker 0: Now, I hope about not buying a PAX badge the day it goes on sale.

593
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:04,373
Speaker 1: It's a shame.

594
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:07,790
Speaker 0: We'll probably be there unless something bad happens.

595
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,790
Speaker 1: And I'm very, very likely to be there.

596
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,830
Speaker 0: And I want to put it on the record that we have suggested perhaps the best possible names for the theaters that they could have down there.

597
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:22,490
Speaker 0: I think they should just take the names of the theaters from regular packs, append them with the right poisonous.

598
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,810
Speaker 1: I heard from a very extremely reliable source.

599
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,130
Speaker 1: There will only be three theaters at PAX OSS.

600
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,404
Speaker 0: I had a list that said there'll be a total of 80 panels.

601
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:32,995
Speaker 1: Possibly.

602
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:34,430
Speaker 0: That sounds about right.

603
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,803
Speaker 0: Based on, you know, we had 300 Kineticon across 11 rooms.

604
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,230
Speaker 1: So, all right.

605
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,909
Speaker 1: Let's uh, Oh, I think we had enough meta here.

606
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,672
Speaker 0: Okay.

607
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:45,156
Speaker 0: Okay.

608
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,930
Speaker 1: Uh, let's move on to our show show.

609
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:59,210
Speaker 0: So before we do the show show, so, you know, burning, burning count is pretty great, but I would like to point out that a long time ago we may or may not have told this anecdote, but it is very relevant to what we're about to do.

610
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,870
Speaker 0: So I feel like it must be repeated.

611
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,070
Speaker 1: Repeating the anecdote.

612
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,080
Speaker 0: We knew a guy.

613
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:03,709
Speaker 1: Let it be written.

614
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,067
Speaker 0: We knew a guy at RIT.

615
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:06,667
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?

616
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:06,809
Speaker 1: Yes.

617
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,610
Speaker 0: I remember his first and last name.

618
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:10,290
Speaker 0: And I remember the last time I saw him.

619
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,299
Speaker 1: Are his initials

620
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:11,359
Speaker 1: A.W.?

621
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,652
Speaker 1: ?

622
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:13,317
Speaker 0: They are indeed.

623
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,910
Speaker 1: And when was the last time you saw him?

624
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,010
Speaker 0: When he was working at Pita Pit.

625
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,869
Speaker 1: We have seen him at the same time as last time.

626
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,990
Speaker 0: So, uh, he's a dude.

627
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,050
Speaker 0: I won't get into anything else about him because it's not really about him.

628
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:24,908
Speaker 1: It's about all of us.

629
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:25,809
Speaker 1: It's not about him at all.

630
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,869
Speaker 0: This is a story for all men of all times.

631
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,570
Speaker 1: Do you want to tell the story entirely on your own or shall we share in the telling?

632
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,570
Speaker 0: So I'll just get right to the point.

633
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,870
Speaker 0: One day, dude comes up to me very early.

634
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,510
Speaker 1: We only met this guy a few times at this point.

635
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,629
Speaker 0: And we were talking about Dungeons and Dragons.

636
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,089
Speaker 1: Who doesn't at nerd school?

637
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

638
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,789
Speaker 1: Who doesn't at nerd school?

639
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,009
Speaker 0: With Dammit Dwayne, which I think is his legal name.

640
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,426
Speaker 0: So it is now we're playing D&D, talking about D&D.

641
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,327
Speaker 1: We're actually at Anime Club talking about D&D.

642
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,030
Speaker 0: So the AW comes over and he's like, ah, I play D&D as well.

643
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,030
Speaker 1: Ah, don't we all.

644
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,709
Speaker 1: It's nerd school.

645
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,349
Speaker 0: Now, we were talking about when we were going to play the next game or something, some like meta detail.

646
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:11,930
Speaker 0: He goes right in with, let me tell you about my character.

647
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,470
Speaker 0: He's a 17th level barbarian named Thag.

648
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:17,689
Speaker 0: It's funny because it sounds like fag.

649
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,144
Speaker 1: Alrighty.

650
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,227
Speaker 0: This went on.

651
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:22,069
Speaker 0: Oh, did this go on?

652
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,364
Speaker 1: It went on far too long.

653
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,530
Speaker 1: I don't know why other people stood standing there.

654
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,510
Speaker 1: I sort of meandered and slinked away with the back.

655
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think at that point I drew aggro.

656
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,944
Speaker 1: But because he was loud, I still heard most of the details.

657
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,310
Speaker 0: So I got to hear all about that.

658
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,850
Speaker 1: I had forgotten as many as I could.

659
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,790
Speaker 1: There was something about the weapon he uses was particularly gay.

660
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:51,110
Speaker 0: So I got to hear all about Thag and his somewhat, I don't know, bigoted adventures through the Dungeons and Dragons.

661
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,890
Speaker 1: Extremely bigoted adventures.

662
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:57,369
Speaker 1: I would also like to point out, perhaps this is relevant, perhaps it is not.

663
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,753
Speaker 1: A.W.

664
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:01,809
Speaker 1: may be the biggest Sailor Moon fan I've ever known.

665
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:02,968
Speaker 0: Uh, no.

666
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:03,355
Speaker 0: No?

667
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,167
Speaker 0: Hoagie Steve.

668
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,030
Speaker 1: Was he, he really liked it more?

669
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think he liked it more.

670
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:07,919
Speaker 0: I don't know.

671
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,029
Speaker 0: He was also a stand up dude.

672
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:10,807
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

673
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,250
Speaker 1: Oh, nothing wrong with Hoagie Steve.

674
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,610
Speaker 0: I will stand by Hoagie Steve and his legacy.

675
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,949
Speaker 1: Hoagie Steve is totally awesome.

676
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,820
Speaker 1: Much more awesome than A.W.

677
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,370
Speaker 1: with his bigoted D&D characters.

678
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:22,910
Speaker 0: If any of you who are there are listening and feel bad, don't feel bad.

679
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:23,530
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

680
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,809
Speaker 0: So the moral here is simple.

681
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,910
Speaker 0: Nobody wants to hear about your D&D character.

682
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:29,589
Speaker 1: That's right.

683
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:37,670
Speaker 0: Even if you both play Dungeons and Dragons, even if Dungeons and Dragons is the only thing either of you care about.

684
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:42,030
Speaker 0: If you're not in the campaign together, no one cares.

685
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:56,590
Speaker 1: Right now, there are things that you can discuss about D&D with other people or any RPG you can discuss, you know, general ideas, you know, the mechanics, rules, you know, you can even tell interesting stories.

686
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,310
Speaker 1: Don't tell about the character, but you can tell the story.

687
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,790
Speaker 1: For example, here is a story example.

688
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,190
Speaker 1: The one I like to tell so often from summer camp.

689
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:13,909
Speaker 1: You know, the GM had created, you know, by hand this big ass dungeon with an evil wizard in it on the top and a castle on top of a cliff like Castlevania and shit.

690
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,949
Speaker 0: Notice Scott has not told me the name or level of a character so far.

691
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,768
Speaker 1: No, I have not.

692
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,989
Speaker 1: We were all to be fun and because we were middle school kids, really high power leveled guys, right?

693
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,469
Speaker 1: One of our players was a druid.

694
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,770
Speaker 1: He cast Summon Big Ass Monster.

695
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:46,369
Speaker 1: He could and he selected from the monster's manual of second edition the earthworm, which proceeded to eat the ground from under the castle and it fell into the sea, thus making it completely unnecessary to go through the dungeon, meet the evil wizard or anything of the such.

696
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:55,090
Speaker 1: The GM probably should have captured someone to be in distress that we had to rescue from the castle so that wouldn't have happened or not, but the castle on a cliff.

697
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:57,650
Speaker 1: And that is a funny story.

698
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,322
Speaker 0: Lessons were learned all around.

699
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:00,310
Speaker 1: Right now.

700
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,150
Speaker 0: Allow me to tell a story and I'm going to tell it in the incorrect way.

701
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,569
Speaker 0: Oh, so I was playing Elaeth Redere.

702
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,530
Speaker 0: He was a 16th level blade singer.

703
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,395
Speaker 1: This is all true.

704
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:10,569
Speaker 1: people just want to let everyone know.

705
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:16,820
Speaker 1: I can verify for one hundred percent that everything he's telling you in this story is true.

706
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,750
Speaker 1: in that rim did play this character.

707
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,370
Speaker 0: Now, I converted him from second head to third head and he got a lot less powerful in third head because the way they changed the rules.

708
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:29,449
Speaker 0: But in second head, he had up to four or five attacks per round, depending on the no one cares.

709
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,490
Speaker 1: You're not going to get going.

710
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:31,730
Speaker 0: No, I'm not going to keep going.

711
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,569
Speaker 1: But don't you really?

712
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,129
Speaker 1: But see, I just want to verify one thing.

713
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:38,330
Speaker 1: While we agreed, no one wants to hear that and no one cares.

714
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:41,250
Speaker 1: Do you or do you not enjoy telling those things?

715
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:42,690
Speaker 0: It feels real good.

716
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,494
Speaker 1: There you go.

717
00:35:43,615 --> 00:35:49,590
Speaker 1: And this is why people do not learn this lesson, because everyone loves to tell you about their character.

718
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,969
Speaker 1: No one likes listening to anyone else.

719
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,589
Speaker 1: So here talk about their character.

720
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:59,910
Speaker 0: It is possible to talk about your characters if you tell what is actually an amusing anecdote.

721
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:07,230
Speaker 0: So mechanical details like if I'm telling Luke Crane, the creator of Burning Wheel, about something crazy that happened in my game.

722
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:17,830
Speaker 0: If I say like OBS 10, eight dice success, the mechanical details actually will be relevant and interesting to him in the context of the story.

723
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:20,489
Speaker 0: For most other people in the world, that is not true.

724
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:30,269
Speaker 0: If you cannot gauge whether or not your audience cares about what level your barbarian was, you should probably leave that detail out and get to the meaty part, like when he killed the dude.

725
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,170
Speaker 1: So with that being said, we both went to Burning Con where we did nothing but play our tabletop RPGs for a weekend.

726
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,521
Speaker 1: Let us tell you about the games we played when.

727
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,170
Speaker 1: there is one great exception to this rule.

728
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 1: And that is you can say whatever you want if you have a podcast.

729
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,189
Speaker 1: And there's another great exception to this rule.

730
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:52,770
Speaker 1: If you don't like listening to us talk about it, just turn this podcast the fuck off.

731
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,810
Speaker 1: In fact, why are you even listening to this podcast?

732
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,058
Speaker 1: What is wrong with you?

733
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,049
Speaker 1: Don't you have something better to do?

734
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,051
Speaker 1: All right.

735
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:02,290
Speaker 1: So Burning Con is the third Burning Con.

736
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:08,990
Speaker 1: It was the Triad Umbert featuring the games of Luke Crane, Vince Baker and John Harper.

737
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:09,711
Speaker 1: Yes.

738
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,092
Speaker 1: Yes.

739
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:15,550
Speaker 1: So, of course, when you go to Burning Con, you must run a session.

740
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,229
Speaker 1: And there are a total of five sessions.

741
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,410
Speaker 1: Despite hurricanes, all of the sessions happened.

742
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:23,190
Speaker 1: And I played in four sessions and ran the final session.

743
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,033
Speaker 0: I did the same.

744
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,130
Speaker 1: And it was like you ran the first session and played four sessions after.

745
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,530
Speaker 0: But I played the same number of games.

746
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,210
Speaker 0: I had the same basic experience in a slightly different order.

747
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,630
Speaker 1: So let us briefly discuss the sessions that we have played.

748
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,770
Speaker 0: Let's start with the one that we both did, because that actually was pretty great.

749
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,786
Speaker 1: OK, so this is run by our friend Matt from NerdNYC.

750
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:42,589
Speaker 1: And it's kind of funny because I knew Matt.

751
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:43,789
Speaker 1: I saw that he was there.

752
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:45,728
Speaker 1: I knew him from NerdNYC.

753
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,861
Speaker 1: He's an acquaintance.

754
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:47,689
Speaker 1: He's a good guy.

755
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,650
Speaker 0: He had played in my game just before.

756
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,290
Speaker 1: And I was looking at the schedule and I saw this Burning Wheel game about dwarves.

757
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,310
Speaker 1: And I said, I'll play a Burning Wheel game about dwarves.

758
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,182
Speaker 1: Who's Matt?

759
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:56,570
Speaker 1: something?

760
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:58,349
Speaker 1: I didn't know his last name.

761
00:37:58,771 --> 00:37:59,518
Speaker 1: I go over to the table.

762
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,650
Speaker 1: I see Matt sitting there.

763
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,690
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, yeah, OK, it's the same guy.

764
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:06,510
Speaker 1: This is what I get for not learning people's last names.

765
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:11,750
Speaker 1: But then knowing him, I'm like, I know he plays the RPGs, but I've never RPG'd with Matt.

766
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,350
Speaker 1: I wonder if he is any good.

767
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:15,749
Speaker 1: And in fact, he was very good.

768
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,910
Speaker 0: Well, I think his game was very nice is what I'm glad.

769
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,130
Speaker 0: One of the most important things about Burning Con is that they had a very strict rule about no hacks, no bullshit.

770
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,383
Speaker 0: I changed the rules of Burning Wheel because I do have hacks.

771
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,709
Speaker 1: It just says parentheses hack.

772
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,330
Speaker 1: So a lot of games said parentheses hack.

773
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,212
Speaker 0: So what?

774
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:46,290
Speaker 0: to to be allowed to run a hack of one of the games, you had to submit all the weird rules and everything possible about your quote hack to the people running the convention for review.

775
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,030
Speaker 0: And they had full veto power.

776
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,432
Speaker 0: All right.

777
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:51,950
Speaker 0: If you did not do this, they offered dire consequences.

778
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,310
Speaker 1: Burning Con is a curated convention.

779
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,509
Speaker 1: They beat the three.

780
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,929
Speaker 1: You know, the triad Umbritt will decide which games will be run when.

781
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,370
Speaker 1: So we played in Matt's game, which was not a hack at all.

782
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,488
Speaker 1: It was Burning Wheel with dwarves.

783
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,830
Speaker 0: Burning Wheel is pretty damn good.

784
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:12,430
Speaker 0: The strength of Burning Wheel, the best convention scenarios are the very straightforward ones, usually involving dwarves.

785
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,070
Speaker 1: That's why I played in five great games.

786
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,531
Speaker 1: And I blame that on always choosing the straightforward Burning Wheel game most of the time.

787
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:23,270
Speaker 1: So his game was pretty much about these dwarves.

788
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:31,610
Speaker 1: And the deal was there were two dwarven castles and two complete asshole dwarven princes, two dwarven princes, one dwarf assholes.

789
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,416
Speaker 0: That's very important.

790
00:39:32,577 --> 00:39:34,430
Speaker 1: One dwarven prince had been there for a long time.

791
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:43,090
Speaker 1: The other one had only appeared recently and they were both competing to dig up precious things from the same mountain range in different mountains.

792
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:44,370
Speaker 0: It was versus Dwarf Fortress.

793
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:44,710
Speaker 1: Yes.

794
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:49,250
Speaker 1: To see, you know, which one their father would approve of more than the other.

795
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:49,490
Speaker 1: Now.

796
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:54,971
Speaker 1: When we were selecting characters, I actually did something that I usually do not do.

797
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:58,770
Speaker 1: Usually I choose, rim can tell what kind of character I will choose.

798
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,430
Speaker 0: Scott usually wants to choose either the guy who's not related to the game at all.

799
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,292
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

800
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:12,374
Speaker 0: Or he wants to choose like usually like the standoffish thief or the guy who's like the super powerful in his particular little realm, like support character.

801
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:12,779
Speaker 0: Yes.

802
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,790
Speaker 1: I like merchants.

803
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:14,758
Speaker 1: Right.

804
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:15,470
Speaker 0: You know, something like that.

805
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,070
Speaker 1: I want to choose like when he played Inheritance, who did I choose?

806
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:21,849
Speaker 1: The dwarven mystical guy with the magic rings.

807
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,299
Speaker 1: The magic rings.

808
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:24,770
Speaker 1: The off to the side guy.

809
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,209
Speaker 1: But this time I said, you know what?

810
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,849
Speaker 1: I'm going to choose the number one guy.

811
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,070
Speaker 1: Give me the dwarven prince.

812
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,973
Speaker 1: I demanded it.

813
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:37,058
Speaker 0: So and I received it was not an asshole when the character she was handed to Scott.

814
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:37,748
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.

815
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:39,381
Speaker 0: Well, yes.

816
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,009
Speaker 0: Yes, it was.

817
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:45,510
Speaker 0: The moment you touched it, he became perhaps the second greatest asshole in that game.

818
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,750
Speaker 1: There's nothing on that character sheet that said nice guy on it.

819
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,657
Speaker 0: There was nothing on it.

820
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:51,030
Speaker 0: Do you have the trait asshole?

821
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:53,090
Speaker 1: It was they had the trait of greedy.

822
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,290
Speaker 0: I also had the trait of greedy.

823
00:40:55,871 --> 00:41:01,190
Speaker 1: OK, I had not only the trait, but also the emotional attribute of greed.

824
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:01,473
Speaker 0: OK.

825
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:01,839
Speaker 0: Right.

826
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:07,970
Speaker 1: All my beliefs were all about digging up as much shit as possible.

827
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,069
Speaker 0: So this broke down pretty well.

828
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:09,793
Speaker 0: I was Scotty.

829
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:13,976
Speaker 0: I was like the super engineer, like I managed all the mining and all the bullshit.

830
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:14,969
Speaker 1: That is what you were in.

831
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:15,532
Speaker 0: Yeah.

832
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:18,812
Speaker 0: So I kind of played that kind of guy, which I usually actually like playing a guy like that.

833
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:23,472
Speaker 0: But it was a kind of an aside because usually I play the big bad like leader type.

834
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,690
Speaker 0: So Scott played the asshole and I played the engineer.

835
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:28,850
Speaker 0: And of course, bullshit goes down in the mine.

836
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,819
Speaker 0: A bunch of dwarves disappear.

837
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,930
Speaker 1: Well, there were two other players.

838
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:31,455
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

839
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:32,268
Speaker 0: They were playing whatever.

840
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,509
Speaker 1: Actually, they were really good.

841
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:34,971
Speaker 1: Yeah.

842
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,637
Speaker 1: One of them was the.

843
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:39,990
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember what their dwarves did.

844
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:41,449
Speaker 0: It was only a few days ago.

845
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:42,627
Speaker 1: Scott, I know.

846
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:44,926
Speaker 0: Really?

847
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:45,069
Speaker 0: Really?

848
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:47,822
Speaker 0: Really?

849
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:48,150
Speaker 0: Really?

850
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:52,088
Speaker 0: So we had the advisor, the smart guy.

851
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,408
Speaker 1: No, the advisor was the was an NPC.

852
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:57,873
Speaker 1: The seneschal.

853
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:02,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, basically one of the characters ended up effectively being the advisor to Scott.

854
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:03,737
Speaker 0: OK.

855
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,450
Speaker 0: And the story is pretty simple.

856
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,370
Speaker 0: The mines, some bullshit happens, bunch of dwarves disappear.

857
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:15,110
Speaker 0: So he goes to investigate and it turns out there's a huge spider army and a spider princess.

858
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,650
Speaker 0: Nobody would roll seduction.

859
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,069
Speaker 0: I was actually really pissed off about that.

860
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:20,059
Speaker 0: You should have.

861
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,010
Speaker 0: And we wanted to wait.

862
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:22,572
Speaker 0: Well, no.

863
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:24,229
Speaker 0: Scott wanted to kill all the spiders.

864
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,270
Speaker 1: I didn't want to kill the spiders.

865
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:32,169
Speaker 1: I wanted to safely extract all of the riches from the mountain, which would not have been possible with a spider presence.

866
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:32,551
Speaker 0: Yeah.

867
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:36,082
Speaker 0: So he basically wants to get the spiders out of the way and get all these gems and rubies and whatever.

868
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:36,529
Speaker 0: Yeah.

869
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:41,832
Speaker 0: The other dude wants to negotiate with the spiders because they actually seem pretty chill.

870
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:45,509
Speaker 1: I was willing to allow negotiations to occur.

871
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:48,990
Speaker 1: But I did not have faith that they would be successful.

872
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:53,189
Speaker 0: It took a deeds point in a duel of wits to convince you to let us do this.

873
00:42:54,030 --> 00:43:05,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is very important because you see, when everything fell apart and the shit hit the fan, all Scott did was turn to the character who made this happen and say, this is your deeds point.

874
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,849
Speaker 0: You wanted this.

875
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:08,830
Speaker 0: This is what you wanted.

876
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,531
Speaker 1: That's right.

877
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:17,230
Speaker 0: So the spiders wanted a sacrifice of a dwarven prince because we owed them some debt.

878
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,910
Speaker 0: So, of course, immediately all of us underling dwarves are like, Scott's really an asshole.

879
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,350
Speaker 0: Let's just sacrifice him to these spiders and then make an alliance with them.

880
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,432
Speaker 1: Of course.

881
00:43:27,914 --> 00:43:31,910
Speaker 0: So Scott tries to instead sacrifice his worthless brother.

882
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:32,773
Speaker 1: Why not?

883
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,289
Speaker 0: I was perfectly willing to help.

884
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,930
Speaker 0: And when I asked you to just fund me for the ability to do it.

885
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,429
Speaker 1: Wait, you asked for unlimited funds.

886
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:53,410
Speaker 1: You were a traitor as you were willing to turn against, you know, and throw away your dwarven loyalty and your dwarven oath in or in for money against.

887
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,910
Speaker 0: You were asking me to turn those ballista around at the true prince of the land.

888
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:05,960
Speaker 0: No, I just sacrifice him to a spider when I was perfectly willing to sacrifice you instead.

889
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,306
Speaker 0: Right.

890
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:12,510
Speaker 1: And that is why I tried to slay the eye for your disloyalty and dishonor.

891
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:14,330
Speaker 0: Like a gold piece.

892
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,350
Speaker 0: I would have been like, OK, you said unlimited funds.

893
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:23,194
Speaker 1: If you had asked for like, you know, 10 gold or something, we could have maybe gotten to negotiations.

894
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:26,290
Speaker 1: But you could have had since your demand was so extreme.

895
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,757
Speaker 0: I offered a suggestion.

896
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:32,530
Speaker 1: that was like walking into a discussion with a crazy creationist.

897
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:39,072
Speaker 0: I was even going to you were golden gems and your counteroffer was cold, hard acts to my neck.

898
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:41,410
Speaker 1: And did that act strike true?

899
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:42,929
Speaker 0: No, because you suck at axes.

900
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:47,948
Speaker 0: And I ran into the castle and barricaded against you and proceeded to try to murder you and everyone around you.

901
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:52,229
Speaker 1: And who turned out the winner at the end of the day?

902
00:44:52,872 --> 00:44:55,209
Speaker 0: So basically, fuck you.

903
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,995
Speaker 1: That's right.

904
00:44:57,015 --> 00:45:02,050
Speaker 0: It wasn't so bad because one, you see, here's how much asshole Scott is.

905
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:06,770
Speaker 0: So he tries to kill or steal his worthless brother and sell him to spiders anyway.

906
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:08,710
Speaker 0: He fails at it due to incompetence.

907
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:10,709
Speaker 0: He comes back dice.

908
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,849
Speaker 1: I failed that to do a dice.

909
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,849
Speaker 0: So meanwhile, these two dwarven princes are fighting.

910
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,016
Speaker 0: The rest of us go to the spiders.

911
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:17,450
Speaker 0: Well, I tell you what, Daddy, two dwarven princes.

912
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,368
Speaker 0: That's what you did and didn't go so well because Scott sucks and stuff went wrong.

913
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,750
Speaker 1: I got the dice turned to my favorite.

914
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:35,708
Speaker 0: So finally, basically he murders me, imprisons my wife, murders in cold blood the spider princess and both of her innocent retainers.

915
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,788
Speaker 1: Innocent spiders trying to eat me.

916
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, based on a deal your granddaddy made with the spiders.

917
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing to do with me.

918
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:46,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, dwarven blood and all.

919
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:48,140
Speaker 1: Right.

920
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,409
Speaker 0: So he does that.

921
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,990
Speaker 0: And thus he has no real army or way to defend the fortress.

922
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:54,350
Speaker 0: And then the spiders come in the night.

923
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,610
Speaker 1: It's moving to my dead brother's fortress, which is a castle and not just a fort.

924
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:00,930
Speaker 0: The denim was kind of sad.

925
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,570
Speaker 0: I think you guys survived, but it wasn't great.

926
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:04,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, I survived.

927
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:05,630
Speaker 0: I just I take issue with your.

928
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:13,550
Speaker 0: A tactical decision to murder the head of both your artillery and your mining operations the mere hours before the spiders were going to invade.

929
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,467
Speaker 1: You were just upset because that was you.

930
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,691
Speaker 1: If it was not you, those being murdered, you probably wouldn't have felt bad about it at all.

931
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:23,550
Speaker 0: It was a pretty great example.

932
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:30,770
Speaker 1: If the Senate shawl had been a player character and that was you and the engineer was an MPC and I wanted to kill the engineer, you would not have given two shits.

933
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,909
Speaker 0: I like how the Senate was like, no, but I'm a reasonable man.

934
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:36,083
Speaker 1: The Senate was the greatest because I had this.

935
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,230
Speaker 1: I had this instinct.

936
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,490
Speaker 1: He betrayed whoever.

937
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,430
Speaker 1: There's the MPC, the Senate shawl, who was like the old wise dwarf to ask for advice.

938
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,990
Speaker 1: I had an instinct to always ask him for advice.

939
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:44,935
Speaker 1: So I always did.

940
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:47,290
Speaker 1: And he and then Matt always did good.

941
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,830
Speaker 1: Matt always came in like, oh, I'm the old dwarf and you should do this.

942
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,550
Speaker 1: When you were like, I said, and whenever he said I did, I was like, yes, I'll do that.

943
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,230
Speaker 0: You were like, I'm going to betray my brother and feed him to the spiders.

944
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,529
Speaker 0: And the Senate shawl was like, that seems like the most wise course of action.

945
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:04,772
Speaker 1: Yeah.

946
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:11,327
Speaker 1: So in fact, you can blame some of my jerky actions on the advice of the GM who told me exactly what to do.

947
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:13,649
Speaker 1: So that was a good game.

948
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,613
Speaker 0: It was a great game.

949
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:23,682
Speaker 0: I got to tell you, if you ever need to run a short, like four hour one off burning wheel game, you cannot go wrong with just burning up four dwarves and giving them beliefs.

950
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:24,170
Speaker 1: All right.

951
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:25,160
Speaker 1: What are the games you play?

952
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:25,970
Speaker 1: And I played in this game.

953
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,890
Speaker 1: The first game I played in was with Rachel.

954
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,270
Speaker 1: Hey, Rachel, are you listening?

955
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:29,732
Speaker 1: I don't know.

956
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:32,250
Speaker 1: Maybe Rachel's totally awesome.

957
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,690
Speaker 0: Rachel is pretty badass.

958
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,110
Speaker 0: I played in several games with her.

959
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,290
Speaker 1: Her game was like, you know, I had first priority in that slot.

960
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,590
Speaker 1: And I'm thankful because that is the game people were piling on because people know.

961
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,250
Speaker 1: And Rachel, she like, you know, I prepared by burning up characters.

962
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,830
Speaker 1: Rachel fucking prepares.

963
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,211
Speaker 1: Right.

964
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:52,990
Speaker 1: She had little stand ups, little faces and little name thingies that little, you know, tense for each character.

965
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:59,329
Speaker 1: And she had like little she had a little stack of paper with a bunch of like people's photographs printed on them.

966
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:08,129
Speaker 1: And whenever a new character, NPC came into the game, she'd write their name on the paper and lay it on the table so that you could remember all the different characters that were going around.

967
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,449
Speaker 1: And oh, man, she she's got the shit going on.

968
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,570
Speaker 0: Actually, you know, I did my games.

969
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,090
Speaker 0: I'm going to do it from now on forever.

970
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:17,250
Speaker 0: I brought sticky name tags that I wrote the names of the characters on.

971
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:19,090
Speaker 0: I didn't put them on the people because that doesn't work.

972
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,030
Speaker 0: I taped into the table in front of each player.

973
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:21,372
Speaker 1: Yeah.

974
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,349
Speaker 1: She did the same thing with the tents, with the pictures, though.

975
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:24,139
Speaker 0: Yeah.

976
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,110
Speaker 1: She really prepared.

977
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:25,995
Speaker 0: So I didn't have pictures.

978
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:28,530
Speaker 1: The game we played, she called it the wreck.

979
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,590
Speaker 1: And basically the idea was it was a prison ship and it was going to a prison colony.

980
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:34,390
Speaker 1: And we were all thieves that had been caught.

981
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,253
Speaker 1: Right.

982
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:36,310
Speaker 1: And we were in the prison ship.

983
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,670
Speaker 1: But then the ship crashes on the shore.

984
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:42,330
Speaker 1: It's on the same island as the colony, but it's not at the colony.

985
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,590
Speaker 1: It's like around the other side of the island.

986
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:47,970
Speaker 1: So, of course, we're mostly free except for some shackles.

987
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:54,030
Speaker 1: Most of everyone else is dead except for the PCs, a couple of NPCs and like the captain.

988
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:59,770
Speaker 1: And then shit goes down and shit went down pretty well.

989
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:00,701
Speaker 1: And it was sort of weird.

990
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:01,490
Speaker 1: It's like I'm playing.

991
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:07,810
Speaker 1: And I sort of felt like I was coasting along, you know, getting fair amount of spotlight time.

992
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:08,513
Speaker 1: Right.

993
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:13,070
Speaker 1: You know, I was feeling good about what I was doing, but I really felt, you know, you know, I wasn't the main person.

994
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:13,494
Speaker 1: I was.

995
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:15,130
Speaker 1: I was sort of, you know, maybe secondary.

996
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:15,833
Speaker 1: Right.

997
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:17,910
Speaker 1: But the plot got in a really good way.

998
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:31,290
Speaker 1: You know, we managed to get some disguises and get, you know, trick people into thinking that we weren't prisoners and then going into town and taking care of all the NPCs who might have wanted to send us to the prison colony.

999
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:37,751
Speaker 1: And sort of set up a new life of, you know, thievery and thieves guildishness on this island.

1000
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:43,433
Speaker 1: That was sort of a brand new colony, you know, and things actually turned out pretty well for us.

1001
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:48,670
Speaker 1: But, you know, there were not a lack of conflicts along the way, meeting strangers in the woods.

1002
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,850
Speaker 0: Whoa, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1003
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,550
Speaker 0: Conflicts and a burning wheel game.

1004
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,277
Speaker 1: No, you know, he was.

1005
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:55,730
Speaker 1: he was overall a most excellent game.

1006
00:49:55,810 --> 00:50:00,852
Speaker 1: It didn't really have any of those too many killer, crazy, exciting moments like trying to kill him.

1007
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:11,493
Speaker 1: But great moments, nonetheless, like tricking the guy in the woods and the thinking that one of us was the captain and just stabbing the captain in the fucking neck.

1008
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:14,150
Speaker 1: Shit like that, you know, good stuff.

1009
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:20,330
Speaker 0: So the first game I played after the dwarf game was a peak role playing experience for me.

1010
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,251
Speaker 0: It was actually one of the greatest role playing experiences I've ever had in my life.

1011
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:31,570
Speaker 0: So the first actual burning wheel I ever played, you know, when the scary loot crane wasn't that wasn't just a demo.

1012
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:31,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1013
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:36,869
Speaker 0: So this loot crane motherfucker tricked me into playing this demo and then he tricked me in playing this other demo and then it was on.

1014
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:40,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the first real burning wheel game I played was that Ubercon.

1015
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:41,866
Speaker 0: Scott was there.

1016
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,489
Speaker 1: Was there an episode about this?

1017
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,849
Speaker 0: There might be, but it was inheritance.

1018
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:49,170
Speaker 0: It was a larvish burning wheel scenario for a whole shit ton of people.

1019
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,530
Speaker 1: It's about a Viking funeral.

1020
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,670
Speaker 0: So he's been keeping this in his head and mulling over for a long time.

1021
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,150
Speaker 0: And he ran it and he's run it several times in this format.

1022
00:50:57,911 --> 00:51:04,695
Speaker 0: He ran it at burning con for nine people as a straight larp, no dice, and he changed himself.

1023
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:05,589
Speaker 0: He got rid of the dwarf.

1024
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,609
Speaker 0: This magic runes.

1025
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,550
Speaker 1: No, it's the most important guy.

1026
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,256
Speaker 1: Not really.

1027
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,850
Speaker 1: No, I think actually merging.

1028
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:19,230
Speaker 1: I mean, I love the dwarven runes guy, but merging the role of the dwarven runes guy with the Christian priest guy really streamlines it.

1029
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,135
Speaker 1: That is an excellent move.

1030
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:29,449
Speaker 0: So you could tell this was big because despite having nine player slots and being the last slot on Saturday, I was the only number two priority person in the game and everyone else was priority one.

1031
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:33,530
Speaker 0: I only got my slot because I got there first and because I had the GoPro.

1032
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,230
Speaker 0: So I think they kind of wanted that to get my GoPro.

1033
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:37,038
Speaker 1: You got in with.

1034
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:37,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

1035
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,358
Speaker 1: Got in with my camera.

1036
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:40,690
Speaker 1: So what if I should not brought it?

1037
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,801
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

1038
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:42,589
Speaker 0: I had mine with me, too.

1039
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:43,747
Speaker 0: I just didn't set it up.

1040
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,009
Speaker 0: So here's the deal with this game.

1041
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:52,430
Speaker 0: He talked a bit about, you know, we talked a bit about those sort of hardcore Danish role playing games and the room had a big table in it in these areas.

1042
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:54,449
Speaker 0: And he used these very interesting rules.

1043
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,670
Speaker 0: The only rules were body language and envelopes weren't allowed to open.

1044
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:04,737
Speaker 0: So the way it worked was you just walked around, you're in the big house and, you know, like a Viking house.

1045
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:06,370
Speaker 0: And I think the year eleven hundred or something.

1046
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:12,510
Speaker 0: And if you are in a conversation, you have to stand like in the circle of the conversation with your name tag visible.

1047
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:19,394
Speaker 0: If you are eavesdropping on a conversation, you stand a little bit back and hold your hand over your name tag.

1048
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:23,054
Speaker 0: No one can engage you, but you cannot interact with the scene at all.

1049
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:24,410
Speaker 1: Oh, but eavesdropped.

1050
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,550
Speaker 1: But you can always enter the scene by taking your hand off.

1051
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:27,453
Speaker 1: No, no.

1052
00:52:27,754 --> 00:52:41,876
Speaker 0: If you are eavesdropping, you cannot enter as your next scene, the scene on which you are eavesdropping, which is actually I don't want to get in all the details of why, but watching it play out is a brilliant rule that this game would not work without that rule.

1053
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:43,270
Speaker 1: That is a clever rule.

1054
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:57,950
Speaker 0: So the other rule is if you are in a scene and it is a confrontational or adversarial thing, you stand shoulder to shoulder angled slightly inward with the people you are allied with, sort of encircling the person you are against.

1055
00:52:58,451 --> 00:53:08,535
Speaker 1: So anyone looking at the scene, just glancing even can see very obviously, even if they're in another scene and not eavesdropping, they can still see the other scenes and how they are constructed.

1056
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:12,094
Speaker 0: They can see who is outnumbered or like who's confronting who.

1057
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:17,639
Speaker 0: Even more importantly, all information learned while eavesdropping officially can be used openly.

1058
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:18,828
Speaker 0: Your character knows it.

1059
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,588
Speaker 1: So there are three and no one can catch you eavesdropping, prevent you from dropping.

1060
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,935
Speaker 0: And there are three areas outside the house, in the private rooms of the house and in the great hall in the middle.

1061
00:53:29,955 --> 00:53:33,177
Speaker 0: So if you're in the great hall, everyone in the great hall is all together all the time.

1062
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,130
Speaker 0: You walk around the great hall and can interact.

1063
00:53:35,972 --> 00:53:38,030
Speaker 0: And it's the story of the prodigal son returning.

1064
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,630
Speaker 0: The Viking grandfather has died.

1065
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:41,950
Speaker 0: They're burning his body in the traditional way.

1066
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,410
Speaker 1: All the sons have returned.

1067
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,270
Speaker 1: Which one will inherit, you know, inheritance?

1068
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:46,230
Speaker 1: Which one will inherit?

1069
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:47,789
Speaker 0: So the two families are there.

1070
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:52,830
Speaker 0: The one son is a worthless, coward, baby loser.

1071
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,850
Speaker 1: One's the badass, awesome, real Viking guy, right?

1072
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:57,870
Speaker 0: So the other son.

1073
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,869
Speaker 1: And one's the Christian guy.

1074
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,454
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

1075
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:00,810
Speaker 0: So the other, you don't remember this.

1076
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:01,385
Speaker 1: They changed it.

1077
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,690
Speaker 0: No, you just don't remember.

1078
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,171
Speaker 0: All right.

1079
00:54:03,352 --> 00:54:08,629
Speaker 0: So the other son actually wasn't there because he was exiled for murdering his fucking brother.

1080
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:12,330
Speaker 0: He was exiled by the father himself from the family.

1081
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:17,532
Speaker 0: So the exiled son returns on the night of the grandfather's funeral to claim his inheritance.

1082
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:26,510
Speaker 0: I played the former Varangian guard, strong man who shows up with him to make sure the family doesn't just murder him outright bodyguard.

1083
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,507
Speaker 0: I played the bodyguard.

1084
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:35,770
Speaker 1: I mean, when we played inheritance in the burning wheel fashion many years ago, the bodyguard was actually one of the more not exciting characters.

1085
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,092
Speaker 0: Yes.

1086
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,908
Speaker 0: So he was updated a little bit.

1087
00:54:38,512 --> 00:54:38,893
Speaker 1: And it's like.

1088
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:44,469
Speaker 1: his only purpose is a mechanical purpose, which was to prevent the prodigal son from being a meat.

1089
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,735
Speaker 0: I don't know what the character, she'd said when the person played the thug before, because he was still a thug.

1090
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,190
Speaker 0: He is a consummate badass in every.

1091
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:56,351
Speaker 1: But now he has the purpose of his own in addition to just protecting the prince from death.

1092
00:54:57,516 --> 00:54:58,620
Speaker 0: Sort of I kind of.

1093
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,468
Speaker 0: I don't know what he might have had that in the game we played and the guy just didn't really play it up.

1094
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:04,569
Speaker 0: But basically I was worldly.

1095
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:05,300
Speaker 0: I'd been around.

1096
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:05,828
Speaker 0: I'm a badass.

1097
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:10,650
Speaker 0: And I wanted to marry a girl who my friend wanted to marry.

1098
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:18,169
Speaker 0: And simultaneously I wanted my friend, you know, the exiled prodigal son, to claim the inheritance because he's my friend and I'll also be rich.

1099
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:21,090
Speaker 0: So I'm going to skip a whole bunch of details.

1100
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,833
Speaker 0: What happened?

1101
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:25,769
Speaker 0: And I can safely say that I won this game.

1102
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:28,370
Speaker 0: That ended with everyone dead.

1103
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,230
Speaker 1: I like how we always say you can't win our winning and losing.

1104
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,469
Speaker 0: Everyone came up to me and they were like, wow, you won.

1105
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:36,590
Speaker 1: And I won in a game where there's no inheritance.

1106
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:41,690
Speaker 0: Yes, I got the inheritance from both families and I got to marry the girl.

1107
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:42,897
Speaker 0: I had an army.

1108
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:44,210
Speaker 0: I had everything.

1109
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:48,489
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there's no winning in RPGs, but if that's true, that's about as close to winning as you can get.

1110
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:49,810
Speaker 0: I had everything.

1111
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,753
Speaker 0: If it was the game we played before, it meant I had all the gold, everything in the will.

1112
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:54,849
Speaker 0: I married the girl.

1113
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:57,649
Speaker 0: Every enemy was dead and the priest.

1114
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:02,670
Speaker 0: Now, the best part of this is I didn't kill anyone.

1115
00:56:03,354 --> 00:56:04,490
Speaker 0: They all killed each other.

1116
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,358
Speaker 0: All I did was stand.

1117
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:06,650
Speaker 0: There's this moment the whole time.

1118
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,990
Speaker 0: Luke Crane keeps coming up to me and whispering in my ear.

1119
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,490
Speaker 0: He's like, Rem, you've got to make your move.

1120
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:12,335
Speaker 0: You're going to lose it.

1121
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:14,530
Speaker 0: You're not you're not being active enough.

1122
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,645
Speaker 0: You're you're going to lose it.

1123
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:15,929
Speaker 0: Come on.

1124
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,330
Speaker 0: Be you know, do something.

1125
00:56:17,993 --> 00:56:19,085
Speaker 0: And I'm like, no, no, I got this.

1126
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:19,448
Speaker 0: Shut up.

1127
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:20,748
Speaker 0: And yeah, I had that.

1128
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:22,310
Speaker 0: I basically just told everyone.

1129
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, you talk to him.

1130
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:23,910
Speaker 0: You hate him.

1131
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,477
Speaker 0: You kill him.

1132
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:25,390
Speaker 0: And I don't know.

1133
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,490
Speaker 0: It's just because most of the people in this game don't know me that well.

1134
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,329
Speaker 0: Everyone took my advice.

1135
00:56:30,411 --> 00:56:32,207
Speaker 0: Everyone did exactly what I told them to do.

1136
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:33,496
Speaker 1: Good job.

1137
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:38,390
Speaker 0: And it came to this climactic moment where I whip out a sword and go to betray the guy I'm with.

1138
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:40,130
Speaker 0: If I kill him, I'm not going to get the inheritance.

1139
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,409
Speaker 0: Like I basically would fuck everything up.

1140
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:44,730
Speaker 0: I put a sword to his throat and I threatened his life in front of his dad.

1141
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:46,439
Speaker 0: And I waited.

1142
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:47,609
Speaker 0: I was totally bluffing.

1143
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:48,810
Speaker 0: You know what happened?

1144
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,230
Speaker 0: Everybody fucking stabbed each other all at once.

1145
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,410
Speaker 0: And I was standing there alone and alive.

1146
00:56:54,191 --> 00:57:00,229
Speaker 0: So when you watch the time lapse, you're going to see like 20 or 30 frames of everyone sitting around a table while the will is being read.

1147
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:08,809
Speaker 0: One frame of everyone standing up suddenly with all the chairs like thrown to the ground, one with everyone standing with swords through each other's throats, and then one with everyone dead but me.

1148
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,490
Speaker 0: And I'm standing there going, why did you do this?

1149
00:57:11,571 --> 00:57:12,649
Speaker 0: You stupid people.

1150
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:20,110
Speaker 1: It was the greatest experience of my life to put together the time lapse such that, you know, some frames last longer than others.

1151
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:21,990
Speaker 0: It is it is brilliant.

1152
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:27,690
Speaker 0: And if you ever get a chance to play Luke Crane's Inheritance LARP, it will be a peak role playing experience for you.

1153
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,350
Speaker 0: However, it is brutal to play.

1154
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:40,470
Speaker 0: You've got to be 100 percent without exception in character for a full two and a half to three hours in a room with eight other people who are also role playing in the same capacity.

1155
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:41,689
Speaker 0: There is no break.

1156
00:57:42,032 --> 00:57:42,890
Speaker 0: There is no delay.

1157
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,189
Speaker 0: And there are only three scenes.

1158
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,150
Speaker 0: It was it was exhausting.

1159
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:55,041
Speaker 1: So while you were playing in that game, I was playing in a game of Dungeoneers.

1160
00:57:57,692 --> 00:57:58,196
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

1161
00:57:58,237 --> 00:57:59,930
Speaker 1: You hadn't played that before.

1162
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:06,470
Speaker 1: So if you don't know, this game is a somewhat maybe going to be official, something modification of Mouseguard.

1163
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:10,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I played it last time, they basically were like, yeah, don't really talk about it and don't record it.

1164
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,939
Speaker 1: No one said anything to me.

1165
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, so go nuts.

1166
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,689
Speaker 1: So if they you know, that's not my problem.

1167
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:17,690
Speaker 1: So basically what it and it was on the schedule.

1168
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,265
Speaker 1: Just people know the game exists.

1169
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:19,650
Speaker 1: I don't care.

1170
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:28,250
Speaker 1: So it's basically it's a modified mouse guard that is basically just for straight up dungeon crawling in the old school D&D way.

1171
00:58:28,732 --> 00:58:29,745
Speaker 1: But it is rough.

1172
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:35,390
Speaker 1: It is like, wow, you are struggling the whole time because it's mouse guard.

1173
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,070
Speaker 1: You're struggling to get checks.

1174
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,710
Speaker 1: You're struggling to succeed at fucking anything.

1175
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,870
Speaker 1: But he's struggling not to just get killed.

1176
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:45,810
Speaker 0: You're struggling when you finally get the loot to fit it in your goddamn backpack.

1177
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:46,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1178
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:52,710
Speaker 1: Anything you do, you know, gives you, you know, statuses like, you know, oh, I'm now I'm angry.

1179
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:54,490
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm exhausted.

1180
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:59,290
Speaker 1: Oh, and I'm sick and I'm and it just brings you down so hard.

1181
00:58:59,712 --> 00:59:02,290
Speaker 1: And you need to earn checks to get it to get it back.

1182
00:59:02,732 --> 00:59:05,250
Speaker 1: But you can't earn checks that easily.

1183
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:07,810
Speaker 1: And then, you know, we had really bad stuff happen.

1184
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,610
Speaker 1: Like I think at one point, like everyone was got like tired simultaneously.

1185
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:16,168
Speaker 1: It was like, oh, no, everyone got hungry simultaneously.

1186
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:22,690
Speaker 0: So it's got with three exceptions, all games in the schedule, had a number of players, four players, five players, nine players.

1187
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,969
Speaker 0: One mouse guard game had guard mice instead of players.

1188
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:29,410
Speaker 0: One game had brave souls instead of players.

1189
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:34,290
Speaker 0: And the Dungeoneers and Dragonslayers that you played had five greedy fools.

1190
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,006
Speaker 1: That is what it had indeed.

1191
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:44,150
Speaker 1: So the five greedy fools went into this dungeon and tried to get as much loot as possible and get out.

1192
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:48,369
Speaker 1: Little bit less role playing, a little bit more dungeoning going on here.

1193
00:59:49,912 --> 00:59:51,784
Speaker 1: But really, this game was just.

1194
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:57,790
Speaker 1: I mean, if you think, you know, I've complained about brutal games like, say, FTL or Ninja Gay Day.

1195
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:00,930
Speaker 1: This was brutal.

1196
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:09,870
Speaker 1: Not only do you struggle not to die, but the inventory Tetris is worse than any inventory Tetris I've ever played.

1197
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,510
Speaker 1: We even had a bag of holding and it's effectively a bag of holding.

1198
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:15,350
Speaker 1: And it's still fucking sucked.

1199
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,790
Speaker 1: We could not fit the shit.

1200
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:21,049
Speaker 1: We had to dump the coins out of the bag of holding to put other shit in there.

1201
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,010
Speaker 1: And then we just like left a pile of coins there.

1202
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:25,850
Speaker 1: And then like I had a two handed sack.

1203
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,290
Speaker 1: But to use the two handed sack, I had the large sack.

1204
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,887
Speaker 1: I mean, I had to carry it.

1205
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:33,190
Speaker 1: I had to carry the large sack in both hands.

1206
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:34,909
Speaker 1: I had a two handed sword.

1207
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:37,245
Speaker 1: Thank you, character maker.

1208
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:37,366
Speaker 1: Right.

1209
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:39,390
Speaker 1: Which means I had a small.

1210
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,950
Speaker 0: You realize he was cackling while he made those characters.

1211
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:44,650
Speaker 1: I had to drop every time I need to stab something.

1212
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:50,690
Speaker 1: I had to put the two the sack on Jersey, drop this sack that was in my other hand to hold the sword with two hands.

1213
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:52,829
Speaker 1: And after the fight, pick the sack up again.

1214
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:57,569
Speaker 1: But to use the large sack, I had to throw away the small sack and the sword.

1215
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:03,604
Speaker 1: Because there's nowhere to put them in the inventory slots because of how many slots they take up.

1216
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,810
Speaker 0: Inventory Tetris is one of those weird mechanics.

1217
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:09,390
Speaker 0: And for whatever reason, just gets me going.

1218
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:09,714
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1219
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:10,768
Speaker 1: And it's like we go in.

1220
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:12,230
Speaker 1: We got all these treasures.

1221
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:13,615
Speaker 1: We carry them.

1222
01:01:13,655 --> 01:01:15,830
Speaker 1: We figure out how to between us, carry them all.

1223
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:19,550
Speaker 1: And then we had to leave and we had to leave a bunch of stuff behind.

1224
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:23,690
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, you play Oregon Trail and you kill all the buffalo.

1225
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,249
Speaker 1: And then it says, sorry, good.

1226
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:27,385
Speaker 1: You only get to carry back 200 pounds of meat.

1227
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:33,250
Speaker 1: This is like, yo, dude, you killed two thousand pounds of meat.

1228
01:01:33,692 --> 01:01:35,986
Speaker 1: You get to carry back five of those pounds.

1229
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:36,549
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1230
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,786
Speaker 1: And I just like you want to kill some.

1231
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:39,048
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1232
01:01:39,874 --> 01:01:42,070
Speaker 0: Oh, and you're tired now because you spent the day shooting.

1233
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:42,451
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1234
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:44,930
Speaker 1: By the way, minus two D to all rolls.

1235
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,210
Speaker 1: And if you want to get some of those rolls back, you could drink some wine.

1236
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,469
Speaker 0: So it's got some food.

1237
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,213
Speaker 1: But guess what?

1238
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,970
Speaker 1: If you eat the drink, the wine, it only empties your wine skin.

1239
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,529
Speaker 1: And it's not like you can put coins in there.

1240
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:56,650
Speaker 1: So it doesn't help you to clear out the inventory.

1241
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:57,730
Speaker 0: So correct me if I'm wrong.

1242
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:03,570
Speaker 0: But when I played this last time in Mouse Guard, you get one free check and you only have to earn extras.

1243
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:05,869
Speaker 0: When I played this, you didn't get any free checks.

1244
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:10,857
Speaker 1: It is true that in Mouse Guard, everybody gets a free check.

1245
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,984
Speaker 1: every time it is the player's turn in dungeoneers and whatever.

1246
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:17,104
Speaker 1: Right.

1247
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:21,310
Speaker 1: You get no checks at all.

1248
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,990
Speaker 1: You need to earn every check that you use, but you can share checks.

1249
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:29,868
Speaker 1: So when I had two checks, I gave checks to some other people who really needed them when I did not need them.

1250
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:31,828
Speaker 1: And vice versa.

1251
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,923
Speaker 0: So so I should clarify one thing.

1252
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,510
Speaker 0: in the LARP, I said I didn't kill anyone.

1253
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:40,610
Speaker 0: So it's kind of an inside joke and almost no one will get it.

1254
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,250
Speaker 0: So the people are there.

1255
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,930
Speaker 0: So Vincent Baker himself played the priest and the will was read.

1256
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:50,109
Speaker 0: And basically, people of the swords turned to the priest and said, you should leave.

1257
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,850
Speaker 0: Here's a bag of gold for your troubles.

1258
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,829
Speaker 0: Walk quickly on the road and hope we don't catch up.

1259
01:02:54,571 --> 01:03:00,784
Speaker 0: So Vincent Baker, being the constant role player, decided that he won and said, see you and exited the game with a pile of gold.

1260
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:01,770
Speaker 1: Nice.

1261
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:09,069
Speaker 0: At the very end of the game, when I'm the last man standing, I go to the crazy witch played by her friend Cat Gefion, the crazy witch I played last time.

1262
01:03:09,491 --> 01:03:13,010
Speaker 0: And she's like, you can't marry my daughter unless you actually worship Thor.

1263
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:17,270
Speaker 0: Which is tricky because I had claimed to be baptized like nine times.

1264
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,230
Speaker 0: All the story shenanigans.

1265
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,890
Speaker 0: So I was like, I will go murder that priest.

1266
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:24,050
Speaker 0: I will catch up to him on the road and bring you back a bag of gold and his head.

1267
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:28,883
Speaker 0: And Vincent Baker, who'd been sitting there like enjoying the denim out of the game, turns to me and says, really?

1268
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:29,748
Speaker 1: Really?

1269
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:32,410
Speaker 0: And then looks like we're going to play this out.

1270
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:34,669
Speaker 1: To prove that you worship Thor.

1271
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,369
Speaker 0: So the Ukraine made us play it out.

1272
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,923
Speaker 0: So the final scene was he.

1273
01:03:40,003 --> 01:03:53,410
Speaker 0: it was like a month later, he was like getting on a boat to go to the new world and he had this bag of money and I was going, well, I show up in his house and I'm just like, so nothing, no offense to you or your God if he answers your prayers.

1274
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:57,309
Speaker 0: But I'm going to kill you and take your head and give it back to that crazy witch so I can marry her daughter.

1275
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:03,989
Speaker 0: And he looks at me and I say, make whatever rituals you have to make, and then I'm going to come back to the room and kill you.

1276
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:05,610
Speaker 0: And it's Vincent Baker.

1277
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,229
Speaker 0: So I'm curious how he's going to role play this.

1278
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,428
Speaker 0: He fucking tried to stab me.

1279
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:14,346
Speaker 0: The priest at the very end had had enough of this Viking bullshit and tried to kill me.

1280
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:15,292
Speaker 0: All right.

1281
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:21,769
Speaker 0: So the mechanic Luke had for this was if you actually tried to kill someone, you had an envelope and he never told you what it was the whole time.

1282
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:23,110
Speaker 0: You try to kill someone.

1283
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:29,029
Speaker 0: You open your envelope and you find the name of the person you tried to kill and it tells you the results.

1284
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:30,594
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

1285
01:04:30,956 --> 01:04:33,429
Speaker 0: So it's basically as though you'd pre-rolled all the roles.

1286
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:45,630
Speaker 0: So he looks like, well, open your envelope and look up Arvandale's name and Vincent Baker dutifully opens the envelope, looks at it and says and looks at it and goes, well, that was expected.

1287
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:50,958
Speaker 1: Well, your character was the big, strong, dangerous guy, the baddest of all.

1288
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:52,430
Speaker 1: Is it bodyguard?

1289
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:57,129
Speaker 1: So I imagine on most people's sheets, it said if they fought you, that you would win.

1290
01:04:57,673 --> 01:04:58,960
Speaker 0: I also had the best instinct ever.

1291
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,026
Speaker 0: Always look for trouble.

1292
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:00,790
Speaker 1: Great.

1293
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:09,370
Speaker 0: So when we were talking about we had this whole like rap session at the end and I was like, I won and I didn't kill a single person.

1294
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,429
Speaker 0: And Vincent looks at me and says, what the fuck?

1295
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:20,266
Speaker 1: OK, so there's besides the sessions that we ran as is a law of burning.

1296
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,462
Speaker 0: My game went OK.

1297
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:23,049
Speaker 0: Wasn't great.

1298
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,550
Speaker 0: I was there as well as I could.

1299
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:26,505
Speaker 1: There was one more session.

1300
01:05:26,545 --> 01:05:27,050
Speaker 1: I played it.

1301
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,050
Speaker 1: And as you know, there was a beginner track.

1302
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:29,434
Speaker 0: One more.

1303
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:30,005
Speaker 0: I had two more.

1304
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,160
Speaker 0: One, two.

1305
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:33,090
Speaker 0: You missed the game.

1306
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,870
Speaker 1: Engineers, am I missing a game?

1307
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,970
Speaker 0: Because I played in a zombie apocalypse game and like modern burning wheel.

1308
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:39,414
Speaker 0: It was a hack.

1309
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:39,757
Speaker 0: It was OK.

1310
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:40,950
Speaker 1: Let me see that schedule.

1311
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:49,707
Speaker 0: It was pretty fun, but I don't have anything notable to say about it, except that I died and I died taking, I think, a G-16 wound.

1312
01:05:52,071 --> 01:05:52,372
Speaker 1: Let's see.

1313
01:05:52,413 --> 01:05:59,470
Speaker 1: I played in Rachel's game, Matt's game, Dungeoneer game, the beginner track game I was about to talk about, and then I ran my game.

1314
01:05:59,610 --> 01:05:59,955
Speaker 1: That's five.

1315
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:01,110
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

1316
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:01,814
Speaker 1: All right.

1317
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,310
Speaker 1: So the beginner track.

1318
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,651
Speaker 1: Right.

1319
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:08,130
Speaker 1: So this burning con featured a new feature, featured a new feature, the beginner track.

1320
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:17,390
Speaker 1: If you had not GM before, you could do the beginner's course on Saturday and then you would be required to run a game that you just been trained to run on Sunday.

1321
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:28,550
Speaker 1: So being all adventurous and also, you know, wanting to sort of walk the walk and say, hey, look, you know, I always say people can't learn to be GMs because they need when they suck.

1322
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,809
Speaker 1: No one wants to play in their games.

1323
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:32,310
Speaker 1: They can't practice and get better because no one wants to play.

1324
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,308
Speaker 1: So they and it's sort of catch twenty two.

1325
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:36,589
Speaker 1: I said, I'm going to go play in a beginner track game.

1326
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:45,188
Speaker 1: So I went and actually the GM of this beginner track game was one of our listeners and the game he ran was not too bad.

1327
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:47,031
Speaker 0: All right.

1328
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:50,070
Speaker 0: Last game I played was something I never played before.

1329
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,606
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember what happened in it.

1330
01:06:52,496 --> 01:06:53,184
Speaker 0: I played the schedule.

1331
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,229
Speaker 0: I played in Ajit's Lady Blackbird game.

1332
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:56,992
Speaker 1: OK.

1333
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:58,470
Speaker 0: Do you know anything about Lady Blackbird?

1334
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,069
Speaker 1: I'm still not bringing up the schedule about me.

1335
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:03,290
Speaker 1: Oh, you need the schedule that I can't remember what the game was about.

1336
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:04,200
Speaker 0: I only pull it back up.

1337
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:04,950
Speaker 0: I got the schedule around.

1338
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,990
Speaker 1: I have heard people talk about Lady Blackbird.

1339
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:19,929
Speaker 1: And all I know is that it is a game where that is, quote, easy to GM because the players do not have to do so much.

1340
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,029
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

1341
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:24,529
Speaker 0: Lady Blackbird is steampunk, the role playing game.

1342
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:28,188
Speaker 0: And the way it works, as far as I can tell, is you have traits.

1343
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,570
Speaker 0: And under each trait, you have a bunch of things.

1344
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,170
Speaker 0: Your character will see something like cunning and under cunning.

1345
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:35,349
Speaker 0: It has like six or seven other descriptors.

1346
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:41,550
Speaker 0: You can if you want to accomplish something, it's burning wheel style obstacles.

1347
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,650
Speaker 0: You know, one, two, three or four, five, six success or failure.

1348
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:46,359
Speaker 0: So what you do is you choose.

1349
01:07:46,419 --> 01:07:48,970
Speaker 0: you get one die because you're a person.

1350
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:49,432
Speaker 0: You're you.

1351
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:57,030
Speaker 0: You get one die for the trait you use and you get one die for every one of those aspects that you also are using and attempting to accomplish something.

1352
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,730
Speaker 0: And then you're given an obstacle.

1353
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:03,310
Speaker 0: And that's the primary core mechanic of the game.

1354
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,309
Speaker 0: Now, to augment that, you have a pool of seven dice.

1355
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:09,049
Speaker 0: You can draw from that pool at any time.

1356
01:08:10,071 --> 01:08:14,390
Speaker 0: If you fail the roll, you get all those dice back and an extra die to the pool.

1357
01:08:15,232 --> 01:08:19,210
Speaker 0: If you succeed at the roll, you lose all the dice you pulled from the pool.

1358
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:24,933
Speaker 0: So basically, the more you fail, you build up this buffer of eventually succeeding and being awesome.

1359
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:30,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, though oftentimes you keep failing roles because you keep trying to do increasingly desperate things.

1360
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,870
Speaker 0: But when you succeed, you're back to nothing.

1361
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:33,410
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like an inverse dread.

1362
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:35,189
Speaker 0: So it is one other mechanic.

1363
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:35,988
Speaker 0: It's very inspector.

1364
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:50,090
Speaker 0: If you want to refresh your pool, you can call for an aside and you basically do the equivalent of turning to another player character and say, yeah, this is just like that time we did the whatever and then role play a flashback like Arabian Nights.

1365
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:50,692
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1366
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,089
Speaker 0: Or like inspectors with the asides.

1367
01:08:54,430 --> 01:09:00,389
Speaker 0: It basically is a role playing heavy game and the dice just come out every now and then to decide if you succeed or fail.

1368
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:03,649
Speaker 0: Succeeding means you get what you want and the plot progresses.

1369
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,850
Speaker 0: Failure just increasingly makes things desperate.

1370
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:09,089
Speaker 0: And the ship is also a character.

1371
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:11,969
Speaker 0: It's really, really fun.

1372
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:18,710
Speaker 0: I played Lady Blackbird, of course, and I was told that I took a very interesting take on Lady Blackbird and the game turned into romantic comedy.

1373
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:20,090
Speaker 0: I ended up dating the captain.

1374
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:20,893
Speaker 1: Okay.

1375
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:24,410
Speaker 0: Also, Lady Blackbirds, the consummate badass and also a wizard.

1376
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:25,517
Speaker 1: Okay.

1377
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:26,450
Speaker 1: In a steampunk setting.

1378
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,870
Speaker 0: So I was like trying to use lightning to take out the security cameras.

1379
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:32,310
Speaker 1: The setting sounds a little bit fan service.

1380
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:39,029
Speaker 0: Now, you know, the setting is an endless blue sky with a dying star in the middle of it and a bunch of landmass.

1381
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:40,380
Speaker 1: How is that not fan service?

1382
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:41,569
Speaker 0: and a bunch of land masses?

1383
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:46,933
Speaker 0: The ships are all airships, the evil empires, kind of like Star Wars, the Thrawny kind of people.

1384
01:09:46,953 --> 01:09:48,370
Speaker 1: Again, how is it not fanservice?

1385
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:50,049
Speaker 0: And remember, we played Air Action Weekly.

1386
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:51,377
Speaker 0: It kind of has this.

1387
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a radio channel.

1388
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,529
Speaker 0: Fucking everyone in the entire world can hear it.

1389
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was great.

1390
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,414
Speaker 1: I'm remembering.

1391
01:09:57,434 --> 01:10:00,330
Speaker 0: It is also one of the better game masters I've ever played with.

1392
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:00,954
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1393
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:01,830
Speaker 1: I talked to him a bunch.

1394
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,329
Speaker 0: He is super cool and he's super good at this.

1395
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:07,710
Speaker 0: And some people from Inheritance were around in this game, too.

1396
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,532
Speaker 1: And I got to say, I actually talked to him at the party and he said he was like a relative nub.

1397
01:10:11,552 --> 01:10:16,180
Speaker 0: And I was like, well, the thing is, Lady Blackbird, he has not played most of these indie RPGs.

1398
01:10:16,302 --> 01:10:16,970
Speaker 0: I felt bad.

1399
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:20,170
Speaker 0: I was the one who booted him out of Inheritance.

1400
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:25,010
Speaker 0: But he the all you have to do to run Lady Blackbird is know how the rules work.

1401
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:29,374
Speaker 0: And every time a character says something, just turn to any other character and say, how do you feel about that?

1402
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:32,290
Speaker 0: How do you feel about you're a you're a noble?

1403
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:34,769
Speaker 0: How do you feel about how the captain just kind of overruled you?

1404
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,049
Speaker 0: Captain, how do you feel that this noble just overruled you?

1405
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:42,589
Speaker 0: No matter if I said something or he said something, he just turned to the other person and said, how do you feel about that?

1406
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a luke crane trick.

1407
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:45,929
Speaker 1: You probably learned that in the beginner's track.

1408
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:47,210
Speaker 0: It works really well.

1409
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,690
Speaker 1: You definitely learn that beginner's track, maybe.

1410
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:55,913
Speaker 1: OK, so the the game I played in with the Nub GM, it was this sort of typical Burning Wheel scenario.

1411
01:10:56,114 --> 01:11:01,310
Speaker 1: And the situation was that there was a tomb, right?

1412
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:06,570
Speaker 1: And someone like the, you know, like the Lord's son had recently passed away.

1413
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:08,008
Speaker 1: But we don't know why.

1414
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:09,215
Speaker 1: And he was.

1415
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:11,809
Speaker 1: he was in the tomb waiting.

1416
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,651
Speaker 1: Right.

1417
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:17,270
Speaker 1: We were the grave robbers and we were going to go rob that grave.

1418
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:20,530
Speaker 1: And each of us had different reasons for wanting to rob the grave.

1419
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:21,033
Speaker 1: Right.

1420
01:11:21,355 --> 01:11:23,530
Speaker 1: Some of us wanted to get in and out fast with treasure.

1421
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:27,130
Speaker 1: Some of us wanted to get the body and bring it out.

1422
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,770
Speaker 1: Some of us wanted to, you know, keep the body in there.

1423
01:11:30,971 --> 01:11:39,174
Speaker 1: And because there was a sorceress who was also coming to get the body, but we got there first and my character wanted to wait till she got there to negotiate with her and all this stuff.

1424
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,448
Speaker 1: And there was something creepy going on.

1425
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:45,130
Speaker 1: And then it became a zombie situation where the dead were rising all over the place.

1426
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:48,070
Speaker 1: And then we're all confronting the sorceress at her palace.

1427
01:11:48,452 --> 01:11:52,670
Speaker 1: And, you know, this sort of typical town goes nuts.

1428
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:54,310
Speaker 1: There's something supernatural going.

1429
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:56,349
Speaker 1: How did this guy even die?

1430
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:59,099
Speaker 1: What is the Lord Duke up to?

1431
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:15,769
Speaker 1: kind of situation, you know, with a lot and the character conflict is pretty good, too, because it's all like, you know, the other guy just wanted to, you know, just like destroy the body or something, whereas I was like, no, no, no, we need to, you know, wait here for the sorceress to show up.

1432
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:17,548
Speaker 1: But I didn't say that.

1433
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:23,075
Speaker 1: And I was, you know, I was trying to yeah, I was trying to delay by like letting the thievy people.

1434
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:25,510
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, let these guys steal some more treasure.

1435
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,769
Speaker 1: Hey, maybe there's another room with more treasure to steal.

1436
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:29,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's go, you know.

1437
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,730
Speaker 1: And he's like, no, no, we got to get out of here now.

1438
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,470
Speaker 1: And I'm like, no, let's steal some more treasure.

1439
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:34,809
Speaker 1: Look, there's all this gold here.

1440
01:12:35,174 --> 01:12:36,229
Speaker 1: It was fake gold.

1441
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:39,650
Speaker 1: It was, you know, it was it for enough GM.

1442
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:41,609
Speaker 1: He did rather well.

1443
01:12:42,051 --> 01:12:48,030
Speaker 1: And he was also very enthusiastic about, you know, doing better the next time.

1444
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:52,190
Speaker 1: And all the devices that people were throwing out, he was like, oh, and writing it down.

1445
01:12:52,350 --> 01:13:04,070
Speaker 1: So I definitely feel that the beginner track was very helpful and that those people that you were beginners now at future burning cons will become Matt's and Rachel's of the future.

1446
01:13:04,272 --> 01:13:05,869
Speaker 1: And you will want to sign up for their games.

1447
01:13:06,552 --> 01:13:08,590
Speaker 0: There were some high caliber role players.

1448
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,092
Speaker 0: I mean, during inheritance, multiple characters broke out into legitimate tears in the course of the game.

1449
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:20,069
Speaker 0: People like when the will was being read, Vincent had this quiver in his voice when a certain fact was revealed.

1450
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,948
Speaker 1: And it was the fact that I know.

1451
01:13:22,472 --> 01:13:24,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, that same fact is the same fact.

1452
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:26,990
Speaker 0: It's a little more nuanced because of some other bullshit.

1453
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:32,570
Speaker 1: But let's just say, well, because well, because his character is reading it right.

1454
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:37,185
Speaker 1: Whereas the character that I played, the dwarf with the runes and he reads, he was like, oh, these fucking humans.

1455
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:37,530
Speaker 1: Right.

1456
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:44,975
Speaker 1: But if that guy reads that will not knowing the content, Luke made us pass the will around to check the seal.

1457
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:47,935
Speaker 0: So everyone held it physically in their hand and had a real seal with wax.

1458
01:13:48,118 --> 01:13:48,910
Speaker 0: No, he didn't have a real sale.

1459
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,670
Speaker 1: Basically, we were like a piece of scotch tape.

1460
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:57,650
Speaker 0: There were a lot of great moments, like when the prodigal son came, he went to put like a burning brand into the fire of the grandfather.

1461
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:01,330
Speaker 0: And Kat, who was playing Geffian, fucking knocked it out of his hand.

1462
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:01,872
Speaker 1: Nice.

1463
01:14:01,892 --> 01:14:04,089
Speaker 0: It was that it was so peak.

1464
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,513
Speaker 1: That was peak.

1465
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:10,915
Speaker 1: So the final thing to talk about is the session that I ran or the session that you ran.

1466
01:14:10,935 --> 01:14:12,450
Speaker 1: But you didn't seem like you want to talk about it very much.

1467
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,009
Speaker 0: I could just we've already gone for over an hour.

1468
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,790
Speaker 1: OK, well, let me quickly just say this about the session I ran.

1469
01:14:17,214 --> 01:14:18,249
Speaker 1: It was the last session.

1470
01:14:18,672 --> 01:14:20,229
Speaker 1: A lot of people weren't there because of Hurricane.

1471
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:24,249
Speaker 1: I thought there might be no players and I could go home and watch football, which was.

1472
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:27,010
Speaker 1: I did get home for the end of the game, which is aggravating.

1473
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:35,076
Speaker 1: And at first I only had one player who was the beginner GM listener who really wanted to play in my game.

1474
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,509
Speaker 1: He told me so, but no one else was in.

1475
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:44,112
Speaker 1: Then I got a second player and then out of which was, you know, no, then the second player left.

1476
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:48,955
Speaker 1: And I'm sitting here thinking football, football, because I wasn't you know, I was confident in my session.

1477
01:14:48,995 --> 01:14:53,530
Speaker 1: I had increased in confidence, but my level of confidence in it had wavered over time.

1478
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:56,889
Speaker 0: But funnily, there were three games in the room and every GM was like, well, I'm OK.

1479
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:01,270
Speaker 1: And the confidence that I had in my game was not at the maximum.

1480
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:01,733
Speaker 1: So I was.

1481
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,730
Speaker 1: I was glad not to run.

1482
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,091
Speaker 1: Right.

1483
01:15:04,573 --> 01:15:07,670
Speaker 1: Then suddenly Lou Crane appears to play in my game.

1484
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,688
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, fuck no.

1485
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:11,376
Speaker 1: Fuck no.

1486
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,869
Speaker 1: So then I go into the second room.

1487
01:15:13,052 --> 01:15:13,274
Speaker 1: Right.

1488
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:14,449
Speaker 1: He's like, well, we're going to play.

1489
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,050
Speaker 1: And suddenly I'm running the game with Lou Crane and I'm like, shit.

1490
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,369
Speaker 1: Suddenly we go into the second room.

1491
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,690
Speaker 1: He bails on the game and I'm like, yes, all right.

1492
01:15:23,116 --> 01:15:24,090
Speaker 1: And income Shervin.

1493
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,449
Speaker 1: And I was like, Shervin, what's up?

1494
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,013
Speaker 1: All right.

1495
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,370
Speaker 1: You know, so now I got, you know, listener and I got Shervin.

1496
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:37,035
Speaker 1: And then almost almost as bad as Lou Crane, but not quite as bad incomes, John and Lamar, who are.

1497
01:15:37,357 --> 01:15:38,386
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, crap.

1498
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:42,770
Speaker 1: What am I going to do now with these expert role players stepping into my game?

1499
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:47,050
Speaker 1: This is not good in a scenario where I do not have full confidence.

1500
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:48,790
Speaker 1: I've never even run a practice run.

1501
01:15:49,172 --> 01:15:50,099
Speaker 1: I've never done anything.

1502
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:51,227
Speaker 1: And I'm sitting there thinking, right.

1503
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:54,209
Speaker 1: Basically is the gist of my scenario that I came up with.

1504
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:56,249
Speaker 1: You're in a normal ass town.

1505
01:15:57,191 --> 01:16:00,450
Speaker 1: There is a monster up in the hills, a legend of a monster up in the hills.

1506
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:01,930
Speaker 1: No one knows if it's really there or not.

1507
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,070
Speaker 1: But the legend is, you know, don't go in the cave.

1508
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,089
Speaker 1: No one's ever returned.

1509
01:16:05,552 --> 01:16:07,590
Speaker 1: If you go near it, there's weird noises, that whole thing.

1510
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:12,890
Speaker 1: The night, the night, like Lancelot, famous night throughout the realm shows up.

1511
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:15,450
Speaker 1: He says, I'm going to take care of this monster everyone's heard about.

1512
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,453
Speaker 1: He goes off.

1513
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:19,970
Speaker 1: You the players are for normal as townsfolk.

1514
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,510
Speaker 1: The innkeeper, the steadfast innkeeper.

1515
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:23,071
Speaker 1: Right.

1516
01:16:23,091 --> 01:16:25,049
Speaker 1: You know, the one that's the MPC in all the video games.

1517
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:30,690
Speaker 1: The bard who plays music in the inn, the town drunk who is a shopkeeper.

1518
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:38,570
Speaker 1: and a foreign merchant who has a caravan that is in town and is sort of, you know, the innkeeper doesn't like it because, you know, business competition.

1519
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:43,530
Speaker 1: So these are the four normal, boring as weak as normal townsfolk.

1520
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:49,630
Speaker 1: And the story is the night returns to the inn while all the four players are in it.

1521
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:53,850
Speaker 1: And he's wounded, but he's carrying mad loot, big time loot.

1522
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:54,352
Speaker 1: Right.

1523
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:58,334
Speaker 1: And I got this idea because the previous year I played in a game that was about.

1524
01:16:58,537 --> 01:16:59,669
Speaker 1: I think we might have talked about it.

1525
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,730
Speaker 1: The four players just killed the dragon and come to town with the loot.

1526
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:08,009
Speaker 1: And I was thinking, what if the four players are normal people in the town and someone else comes in with the loot?

1527
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:08,512
Speaker 1: Right.

1528
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:14,710
Speaker 1: It's sort of the opposite instead of the players being the people, the loot, the players, people trying to get the loot from the player who is the night.

1529
01:17:15,232 --> 01:17:19,974
Speaker 1: So, you know, I dropped these beliefs and these character sheets on these four people.

1530
01:17:20,055 --> 01:17:21,090
Speaker 1: That's all I dropped on them.

1531
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:22,630
Speaker 1: I wasn't as prepared as Rachel.

1532
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:23,374
Speaker 1: I wasn't right.

1533
01:17:23,898 --> 01:17:25,389
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what am I going to do?

1534
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,393
Speaker 1: What's going to happen?

1535
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:33,410
Speaker 1: And of course, expert role player John immediately before I could even make the I'm thinking, all right, we got to start the game.

1536
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:36,809
Speaker 1: I got to make the night show up before I can even make the night show up.

1537
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:45,996
Speaker 1: John goes full on with the singing, attacking the shopkeeper, trying to he hit in the first.

1538
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:51,310
Speaker 1: he immediately begins the game and hits all his beliefs on a single role before anything has even happened.

1539
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:56,529
Speaker 0: I'm reminded of the moment way back when we first played the sword, when Luke came found us arguing and said, no, I'll go on.

1540
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:58,470
Speaker 1: That is exactly what occurred.

1541
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:09,168
Speaker 1: And actually, I started running this game and a lot of it I cannot deny a significant portion of it must have been due to the excellent skills of all.

1542
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:12,350
Speaker 1: four of the players at the table were a plus playing.

1543
01:18:12,611 --> 01:18:23,330
Speaker 1: I could not ask for easier people to run a game for, but I was actually surprised looking at myself with the third person view at the quality of my game running.

1544
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,670
Speaker 1: I said, man, I wish I was playing in this game.

1545
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:27,310
Speaker 1: Why am I doing a good job?

1546
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,289
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

1547
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,354
Speaker 1: How is this happening?

1548
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:35,669
Speaker 1: So now I just kind of want to run this game for other people's because I feel good about running it.

1549
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:36,151
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1550
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:45,350
Speaker 1: And I'm what I'm really wondering, though, could I run a campaign game that goes on as well as I was running that one time game?

1551
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:46,296
Speaker 0: You could try again.

1552
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:47,850
Speaker 0: We could try to do Dwarf Fortress again.

1553
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,370
Speaker 1: But I don't know if we do Dwarf Fortress.

1554
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,159
Speaker 1: We'll do something.

1555
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:50,850
Speaker 0: I like Dwarf Fortress.

1556
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,610
Speaker 1: I really want to do townsfolk because I'm liking townsfolk.

1557
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,270
Speaker 0: I'm liking dwarves lately.

1558
01:18:56,054 --> 01:18:57,430
Speaker 1: I like townsfolk.

1559
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,097
Speaker 0: Thing is, I'm playing.

1560
01:18:58,178 --> 01:18:59,130
Speaker 1: it proves me right.

1561
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,694
Speaker 1: That the thing I've always wanted to play was boring as townsfolk and I was able to make it work.

1562
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:04,719
Speaker 1: So it was.

1563
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,659
Speaker 1: it was just like, yeah, no one else wanted to play boring townsfolk but me.

1564
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:08,650
Speaker 1: And look, I was right.

1565
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,329
Speaker 1: Boring as townsfolk is a great game.

1566
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:11,836
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

1567
01:19:13,204 --> 01:19:14,009
Speaker 0: So fag.

1568
01:19:16,531 --> 01:19:18,746
Speaker 0: Sadly, the after party, I did not go.

1569
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,235
Speaker 1: I went to watch football.

1570
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:27,933
Speaker 0: I went to the after party and then I literally rode the last train out of Dodge because the hurricane was coming in and all the subways were closing down.

1571
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:32,249
Speaker 0: I got on the last train out of Manhattan, literally like the like.

1572
01:19:32,631 --> 01:19:34,190
Speaker 0: we walk up and everything's roped off.

1573
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:35,337
Speaker 0: I'm like, fuck, did we miss it?

1574
01:19:36,002 --> 01:19:37,169
Speaker 0: And then there's this crazy guy.

1575
01:19:37,574 --> 01:19:38,140
Speaker 0: He wasn't crazy.

1576
01:19:38,161 --> 01:19:38,930
Speaker 0: He was just one of those guys.

1577
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:42,170
Speaker 0: Anyone who talks to you in the subway who isn't an official is probably crazy.

1578
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,329
Speaker 0: And he starts explaining what's going on.

1579
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:50,130
Speaker 0: But in a kind of crazy way and how it's the government conspiracy, like that's why the hurricane's coming in, why they're shutting everything down.

1580
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:50,674
Speaker 0: But whatever.

1581
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:52,510
Speaker 0: So we wait.

1582
01:19:53,031 --> 01:20:02,130
Speaker 0: And then sure enough, the last train out of Dodge pulls up and then the person in the booth turns off the light, locks the door to the booth, opens the exit door.

1583
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,378
Speaker 0: We all walk through with her.

1584
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:07,028
Speaker 0: We all got on the train together and we left the subway station empty and the lights all turned off behind us.

1585
01:20:07,331 --> 01:20:09,010
Speaker 0: Well, it was awesome.

1586
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:14,270
Speaker 1: So today on the subway, they're making all these announcements about the limited service and one of the announcements.

1587
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:15,809
Speaker 1: You know what the guy said on the train?

1588
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:23,055
Speaker 1: He said the end trains go to thirty fourth street where you can transfer to the BMT or IND.

1589
01:20:23,095 --> 01:20:23,338
Speaker 1: Whoa.

1590
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:32,130
Speaker 1: And as soon as I heard that guy must be like as soon as I heard that, I was like, how old is the dude who is freaking running this train?

1591
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:32,656
Speaker 1: Because it's true.

1592
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:33,750
Speaker 1: The IRT wasn't running.

1593
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:34,157
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1594
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:34,770
Speaker 1: Right.

1595
01:20:35,051 --> 01:20:40,718
Speaker 1: I was like, how old is the guy who is, you know, conducting this train or engineering this subway train?

1596
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:41,890
Speaker 1: That is epic.

1597
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:42,738
Speaker 1: He didn't say it again.

1598
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:43,870
Speaker 1: I kept listening to his announcement.

1599
01:20:44,896 --> 01:20:45,708
Speaker 1: He only said it once.

1600
01:20:45,911 --> 01:20:47,029
Speaker 1: He said BMT, IND.

1601
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:49,630
Speaker 0: And I was like, that's how you know if someone's actually an immortal.

1602
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,231
Speaker 1: And I was.

1603
01:20:50,252 --> 01:20:53,472
Speaker 1: I was like, am I the only one on this train who understood what that guy just said?

1604
01:20:53,493 --> 01:20:54,810
Speaker 0: The thing is, we never lived through it.

1605
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,150
Speaker 0: We just know it thanks to Wikipedia because that's the only reason I know anything.

1606
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:05,314
Speaker 0: I learned a little bit from our and I repeat that fact often, but apparently no one learns that.

1607
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:07,270
Speaker 1: That's they keep thinking I'm smart.

1608
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:07,856
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1609
01:21:07,877 --> 01:21:08,770
Speaker 0: Burning Con was great.

1610
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:15,273
Speaker 1: If anyway, if best burning con yet, five excellent sessions past burning cons have had four or three.

1611
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:21,141
Speaker 0: If any of you did not go because you were afraid of running a game, you're a fool.

1612
01:21:21,161 --> 01:21:22,110
Speaker 1: I pity you fool.

1613
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:25,409
Speaker 0: This was this is one of the better conventions I've ever been to.

1614
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:32,476
Speaker 1: I played five sessions of role playing through a hurricane over two days and all five of them were a plus.

1615
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:36,250
Speaker 1: You can't you can't get that kind of shit at like fucking Gen Con.

1616
01:21:36,652 --> 01:21:38,669
Speaker 1: This was in New York City and it was so cheap.

1617
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:45,170
Speaker 0: I, as Lady Blackbird, cast off my disguise 10 seconds into the scenario and broadcast my love of the Pirate King to the world.

1618
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,169
Speaker 1: I think I'm just going to run my scenario straight up again next year.

1619
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:48,634
Speaker 0: Watch out.

1620
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:49,328
Speaker 0: You know what I'm going to do?

1621
01:21:49,852 --> 01:21:50,316
Speaker 0: Plan it.

1622
01:21:50,982 --> 01:21:51,446
Speaker 1: No, you can't.

1623
01:21:52,132 --> 01:21:54,050
Speaker 0: Well, it'll be like me, Lou Crane, Tor.

1624
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:55,034
Speaker 0: Not allowed.

1625
01:21:55,134 --> 01:21:57,490
Speaker 1: I actually played in two games of Tor this week.

1626
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,850
Speaker 0: It's really fun to play in a game with Tor.

1627
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,862
Speaker 1: I've never had the shipwreck game and also the.

1628
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,610
Speaker 1: we played inheritance with him last year.

1629
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:06,749
Speaker 0: I played this like mouse guard Victorian thing that he was in.

1630
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:07,051
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1631
01:22:07,071 --> 01:22:08,690
Speaker 1: And he also played the Dungeoneer's game.

1632
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:12,730
Speaker 1: But the day he really busted out in that thief game hardcore.

1633
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:19,490
Speaker 1: I was like, you know, this one point where he sort of unexpectedly busted out and I was like, his character got mad angry.

1634
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,174
Speaker 1: And I was.

1635
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:22,528
Speaker 1: I was like, whoa, watch that.

1636
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:30,000
