1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,646
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, May 27th.

2
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:12,167
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:12,669
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:13,832
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:25,902
Speaker 0: Tonight, our coverage of Anime Boston 2009.

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,949
Speaker 0: Hello everyone from Anime Boston.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,592
Speaker 0: We're home.

9
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:34,677
Speaker 1: Oh snap.

10
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:35,099
Speaker 0: We made it.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,947
Speaker 1: We made it a couple days ago.

12
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:42,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is our first, you know, anime show after Anime Boston.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,280
Speaker 0: And because we skipped Katsu-Kan this year, Anime Boston was really the beginning of the Kan season for us.

14
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:55,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it totally, I think we're gonna replace Katsu-Kan with Anime Boston, which is good because it saves us some traveling.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Anime Boston, we'd never been before and it, many of you at the Kan heard this story.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,239
Speaker 0: And I know many of you were new and people who listen to the show know a lot of our previous coverages of Anime Boston's.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,860
Speaker 0: But we ended up going for the first time and it wasn't that we tried to avoid Anime Boston.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,490
Speaker 0: I always, every year, wanted to go to Anime Boston.

19
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,780
Speaker 0: It just always came at like the wrong time.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,340
Speaker 1: Why don't we save the Anime Boston talk for the Anime Boston portion of the show?

21
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,640
Speaker 0: Okay, but for all of you who are new, this is Geek Nights.

22
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:26,198
Speaker 0: I assume you're an anime fan since we did primarily anime panels.

23
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:27,799
Speaker 1: However... We did one gaming panel.

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,480
Speaker 0: We did one gaming panel, Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, and if you found this episode first, Tuesday nights of gaming.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,520
Speaker 0: And if you don't care about anime and you care about Burning Wheel and D&D, well, Tuesdays.

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:38,960
Speaker 1: Tuesdays.

27
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,319
Speaker 0: Mondays are Linux neckbeard stuff.

28
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,460
Speaker 1: Which you probably really don't care about.

29
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,800
Speaker 0: I don't know, we met some neckbeard-y people at that Kan.

30
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were outside the Kan.

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were in the city.

32
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:52,839
Speaker 0: I think that's close enough.

33
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause MIT's across the river, that's why.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,319
Speaker 0: But before we talk about Anime Boston, our full review that I know many of you have been waiting for.

35
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,788
Speaker 0: And also we'll have a link to the Anime.

36
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:05,800
Speaker 0: You Should See slides that everyone's been freaking asking for.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,506
Speaker 0: But anyway, a little bit of news.

38
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:12,880
Speaker 0: We are, in fact, we hadn't announced anything yet, going to be attending Otacon, like we always do.

39
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,840
Speaker 0: Like we have every year since 2002.

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:27,960
Speaker 0: And we are going to be doing, sadly, they didn't want us to do any of our new panels, so you'll have to wait until, I guess, the New York Anime Festival, or maybe, maybe, Connecticut to see Tales from the Anime Club.

41
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,771
Speaker 0: But we're doing Cover Your Bases, which is a little hint.

42
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,540
Speaker 0: That's just anime you should see with a different name.

43
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:35,498
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

44
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:37,940
Speaker 0: And Know Your Creators.

45
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,580
Speaker 1: I hope people don't think it's a baseball panel about baseball manga.

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
Speaker 0: Oh my god, well the description will at least set them straight.

47
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,899
Speaker 1: People don't read the description, they look at the title only.

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,860
Speaker 0: See, the problem is, anyone who goes to a panel on baseball anime has already seen a lot of anime.

49
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:52,271
Speaker 1: Exactly.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,720
Speaker 0: Not many people start on like Princess 9.

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,097
Speaker 1: Exactly.

52
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:00,160
Speaker 0: And we're doing Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,440
Speaker 1: Which has nothing to do with Otacon.

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,475
Speaker 0: Except for the fact that the crossover between anime and video games and board games and all that stuff is effectively infinite at this point.

55
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:11,560
Speaker 0: I mean, the Venn diagram is so close.

56
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:12,081
Speaker 1: I know.

57
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:13,885
Speaker 1: It's just saying.

58
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,268
Speaker 1: It's so sad though.

59
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:20,259
Speaker 1: It's like we go to this anime convention for Otaku Generation and we say, "Here's a bunch of

60
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:20,540
Speaker 1: stuff."

61
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,523
Speaker 1: And they say, "Yeah, we want the same old, same

62
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:22,844
Speaker 1: old.".

63
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,587
Speaker 1: It's like, "Really?

64
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:31,519
Speaker 1: If I was a panel picker, I would never pick the same panel to repeat unless it was opening

65
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,180
Speaker 1: ceremonies.".

66
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,385
Speaker 0: See, Scott, I would say just the opposite.

67
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:40,740
Speaker 0: There are certain panels or types of panels that at large conventions you pretty much need every year because so many people come every year.

68
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,642
Speaker 0: There's so many new fans.

69
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:49,020
Speaker 0: I mean, the panel that tells people who don't know what anime to watch, who just got into anime, what anime to watch is an important panel.

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,806
Speaker 0: The, you know, how to run an anime club panel is an important panel.

71
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:59,840
Speaker 0: There's all these kind of basic panels that you pretty much have to run every year and you'll always have people who have never seen it and need to see it.

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, but quite often those are the people who do not come to that panel.

73
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,242
Speaker 0: They will.

74
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,289
Speaker 0: I mean, look at Anime Boston.

75
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:06,940
Speaker 0: How many people came to anime you should see?

76
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:11,311
Speaker 1: That was a lot of people, but, you know, many of them had seen anime.

77
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:14,580
Speaker 1: judging by, you know, about half the people there were, you know, grown in and...

78
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,920
Speaker 0: See, while you say that, half the people there had never seen Cowboy Bebop.

79
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,481
Speaker 1: I know.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,262
Speaker 1: It's scary.

81
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:22,011
Speaker 1: It's like half the people, like, knew it and half the people didn't know it.

82
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,300
Speaker 1: And I really wondered, like, why the half the people who knew it were there.

83
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,269
Speaker 0: But even those people, they hadn't seen half the other stuff.

84
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,159
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone, maybe like four people out of the 800 in that room...

85
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,450
Speaker 1: Are we in that much of a minority?

86
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,300
Speaker 1: Are we the only people who've seen the stuff?

87
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:45,699
Speaker 0: Well, remember when there was that someone posted in a forum thread a list of, like, the 100 greatest anime, and I remember going through the list, I had seen, like, 96 of them all the way through, and I knew what 100 of them were.

88
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:46,857
Speaker 0: Yeah.

89
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,000
Speaker 0: It made me almost a little bit sad for myself.

90
00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:07,400
Speaker 1: Well, there's not, you know, it shows you that there's, you know, there's a lot of anime, but it's not really so much that it's like, you can never watch it all, but you can surmount it, you know, such that, you know, you have a sufficient knowledge of a great deal of the work.

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,775
Speaker 1: It's like, you can never read all the books, but if you spent your life reading, like, sci-fi books, you could conquer enough of them, you know.

92
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:20,020
Speaker 1: Someone giving you a list of the greatest ones is like, yeah, I got that.

93
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:25,131
Speaker 0: But at least for OdaKan, for these sorts of panels, I have this feeling that we're gonna be running Anime.

94
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:29,440
Speaker 0: You Should See and Know Your Creators in some capacity at most anime conventions that we attend from now on.

95
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:37,580
Speaker 1: Well, even if you agree with the argument that those panels should be run at every convention, you know, over and over again, let's get someone else to run those and do something different.

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:37,840
Speaker 0: Why?

97
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,643
Speaker 0: I enjoy doing it.

98
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:44,160
Speaker 0: Plus, we've changed it up every time, and we got Daryl Surratt, and I think he added a lot to Anime You Should See.

99
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:51,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also, you know, he came from Florida, so I felt bad that if he came here and didn't do anything, that would be sort of like a waste of his trip.

100
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, he had a lot to do on his own.

101
00:05:51,921 --> 00:06:06,480
Speaker 0: I mean, we'll talk about the random awesomeness of that vile specter of Moe panel, but the other thing is that if you saw Anime You Should See at Anime Boston, do not come to see it at OdaKan.

102
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,585
Speaker 0: It is going to be the exact same panel.

103
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:11,507
Speaker 0: Like, exactly.

104
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,450
Speaker 0: Anime for anime, almost word for word.

105
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,472
Speaker 0: Just leave it be.

106
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:20,160
Speaker 0: However, Know Your Creators is basically going to be completely different, so go ahead and go to that one.

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,834
Speaker 0: I say this primarily because every con we go to, Anime You Should See is like standing room only, like people lined up outside, they have to turn a bunch of people away.

108
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,340
Speaker 0: Know Your Creators never fills the room.

109
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kinda sad.

110
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:37,200
Speaker 1: Because really, Know Your Creators is the one that probably should get more people.

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,200
Speaker 0: But in other OdaKan news, I do want to bring this up before we get...

112
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
Speaker 1: Maybe we should change the name to Creators You Should Know.

113
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:47,419
Speaker 0: I kinda want to change it to like, Six Grades or something about six, and then every time we do it...

114
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,618
Speaker 1: Why do you pick six?

115
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,980
Speaker 0: That way we can give ten minutes per creator.

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,780
Speaker 1: I guess, but you're forgetting the time it takes for the intro and the outro.

117
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:58,028
Speaker 0: Well, ten minutes per creator, but there's some overlap.

118
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:02,699
Speaker 0: Like, if I do Oshii and Shiro, there's going to be about five minutes of overlap between the two.

119
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:05,740
Speaker 0: Which leaves them with only fifteen minutes total.

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but OdaKan, other news, OdaKan's coming up, you know, we said we're going to go, and they opened up the Artist Alley, as they always do.

121
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:24,040
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was a record this year, but I applied for the Geek Nights Artist Alley table within a couple hours of them announcing registration.

122
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,838
Speaker 0: And I am so far down the waiting list that there's no point.

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,760
Speaker 0: And this is a problem every year, and I can't blame OdaKan or any convention that has this problem, because what do you do?

124
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,880
Speaker 0: You have a very limited supply of Artist Alley tables, and an order of magnitude more people who want Artist Alley tables.

125
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:48,320
Speaker 0: And any method you come up with to decide who gets them and who doesn't is going to be unfair to someone as opposed to someone else.

126
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:50,820
Speaker 0: Or is going to cause some problem over another problem.

127
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,420
Speaker 1: One thing I would like to say, right, is that the room the Artist Alley is in is a very large room, yes?

128
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:01,740
Speaker 1: There is a significant portion of that room that is relatively empty.

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,520
Speaker 0: I think part of it is that there are rules about how much of the room can be filled with stuff.

130
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,899
Speaker 1: I agree that there are rules about how much of the room can be filled with stuff.

131
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,760
Speaker 1: However, I would also like to point out they have that area that is like, I guess, nominally for CCGs that no one uses at all.

132
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,420
Speaker 1: And everyone just uses it to eat lunch, right?

133
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,829
Speaker 0: Here's how I feel about that area.

134
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,380
Speaker 0: The New York Anime Festival has it right.

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,259
Speaker 0: They just turned it into a maid cafe and didn't even pretend.

136
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,540
Speaker 0: Or what OdaKan can do, either drop the tabletop gaming or get us to run it.

137
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:32,802
Speaker 1: Right.

138
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:37,640
Speaker 1: Either make that a real area and beef it up or turn it into Artist Alley tables.

139
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,500
Speaker 1: And two, right, the art show really has not held up so much.

140
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,195
Speaker 1: And I think, you know...

141
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,713
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, are you proposing to get rid of the art show?

142
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:48,660
Speaker 0: Because it always fills up.

143
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,620
Speaker 1: I am proposing they reduce the art show slightly.

144
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,193
Speaker 0: How so?

145
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:58,200
Speaker 1: By reducing the available space and, you know, having some sort of quality filtration.

146
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,852
Speaker 0: See, that's the problem.

147
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:00,699
Speaker 0: Quality filtration.

148
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 1: There are always a few empty things, you know, that no one hangs up on.

149
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,882
Speaker 0: Why even bother?

150
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:12,480
Speaker 0: Because the amount of space you'll save by cutting like four of those partitions out of there is not going to affect anything else in that room at all.

151
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:19,500
Speaker 0: There is no way to reduce the art show enough to make an impact without ruining the art show.

152
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,270
Speaker 0: And you'll just make more people unhappy.

153
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,779
Speaker 0: The art show, I think, should stay the way it is.

154
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:32,520
Speaker 1: Also, I've heard complaints from artists who put things in the art show about the... They made a change to the way, you know, the finances of the art show for artists.

155
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:35,680
Speaker 1: And it's actually a very bad deal for the artists.

156
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:39,360
Speaker 1: Unless you can sell something that's really good for a large amount of money.

157
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,579
Speaker 1: So I think the art show...

158
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,918
Speaker 0: What were the changes?

159
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:45,100
Speaker 1: I forget exactly, but many artists were complaining.

160
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,515
Speaker 0: Yes, but Scott...

161
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,100
Speaker 1: Basically, it's not worth it financially unless you sell something for a shit ton of money.

162
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,820
Speaker 1: In which case, if they want to keep that financial arrangement, they should pretty much only allow things that are going to sell for a shit ton of money.

163
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,873
Speaker 0: Wait, but Scott, I mean, what are even the changes?

164
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,880
Speaker 0: You don't even know.

165
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,860
Speaker 0: And how often do the artists at like an artist's alley or something complain about nothing violently?

166
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,220
Speaker 1: Well, Nuri was complaining, so I trust what she said.

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,344
Speaker 0: Alright, well, I'll look it up.

168
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:11,640
Speaker 0: if you're going to bring this up without any references or citations other than hearsay.

169
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:12,808
Speaker 1: It's not hearsay.

170
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,520
Speaker 1: I'm referencing a person who complained.

171
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,326
Speaker 0: Yes, that's hearsay.

172
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:16,799
Speaker 0: That's the definition of hearsay.

173
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,860
Speaker 1: They changed something anyway.

174
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,720
Speaker 0: Regardless, even if you cut it in half, that'll have no impact on any other part of the room.

175
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,653
Speaker 1: Well, the whole area behind the art show is always empty.

176
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,040
Speaker 1: Like, just a big empty space.

177
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,896
Speaker 0: But if it's empty anyway, then you could...

178
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,019
Speaker 1: Fill it with tables.

179
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,760
Speaker 0: No, you can't most likely.

180
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should.

181
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,179
Speaker 1: They probably can't.

182
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,778
Speaker 1: Find a way.

183
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:39,380
Speaker 1: At the very least, you could spread out the existing tables.

184
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:48,960
Speaker 0: No, the problem I realized, I didn't think of until recently, was that doing it the way they do... I mean, there's no safe or fair way to dole out the artist's alley tables.

185
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,020
Speaker 0: But doing it first come, first serve, I'm starting to feel, is the worst possible way.

186
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:54,198
Speaker 1: It is the worst possible way.

187
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,720
Speaker 0: Not because it rewards the most obsessive people or anything like that.

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,220
Speaker 0: Because that probably is better than just giving it out randomly to reward the people who care the most.

189
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Speaker 0: The problem is that it doesn't necessarily reward the people who care the most.

190
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:21,320
Speaker 0: It basically will create this sort of meme propagation to where as soon as one person in a group of friends gets a table, they have called all of their friends on the phone immediately, and those people have all gotten tables.

191
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,780
Speaker 0: So the people who start getting tables, the people who find out that it opened and get the first submissions in, are all friends with each other in this long chain of friendship.

192
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,760
Speaker 1: Well, there might be a few trees, because anyone who discovers it on their own quickly enough is like a beginning node.

193
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:45,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point remains that you'll have generally very strong lineages of people that are all related to each other, and you'll kind of get a lot of samey-ness in the artist's alley as a result.

194
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,899
Speaker 1: Well, the artist's alley at all the conventions have been very samey.

195
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,700
Speaker 0: Well, I would argue that Anime Boston wasn't at all.

196
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,520
Speaker 1: No, I see a whole bunch of the tables in Anime Boston were tables I had seen previously and previously and previously.

197
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:59,100
Speaker 0: I'd say about a third, maybe a quarter.

198
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,819
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

199
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,300
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that big of a deal.

200
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,380
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal, I'm just saying it's a lot.

201
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:10,300
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who are just in that artist's alley community, they're in the artist's alley at every con, you always see them.

202
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:20,359
Speaker 0: See, but the point is that the samey-ness at Otacon would be vastly mitigated if the cliques of artists who all know each other weren't practically guaranteed to either all get in or none of them get in.

203
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,600
Speaker 0: Because that, I think, contributes to a lot of the samey-ness.

204
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,139
Speaker 0: Never mind the people who scammed Otacon last year.

205
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:31,100
Speaker 0: Those people were at Anime Boston and they had two sets of tables.

206
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,400
Speaker 0: It was, I don't know what to do about those people.

207
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

208
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,460
Speaker 0: But, I mean, look at last year, right?

209
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,918
Speaker 0: I mean, we didn't do anything like that, but the front row crew, because I happened to be awake and I called all of our friends when the artist's alley opened up last year, we had 14 tables.

210
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,840
Speaker 0: Everyone in the front row crew had an artist's alley table just about.

211
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,960
Speaker 1: It wasn't 14 tables, it was like one.

212
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:55,260
Speaker 0: We had 14 originally and we dropped several of them because we didn't fill them up.

213
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,026
Speaker 1: I was trying to count.

214
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:57,960
Speaker 1: We only had like 10.

215
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,804
Speaker 0: We had 14 tables when we started.

216
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,934
Speaker 0: We dropped it down to, I believe, 12 at the end.

217
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,579
Speaker 0: And this year, zero.

218
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,942
Speaker 1: Oh well.

219
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:08,480
Speaker 1: I didn't really want to sit in the artist's alley anyway.

220
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,480
Speaker 0: Oh no, I was going to hire someone to sit at an artist's alley table.

221
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,240
Speaker 1: I didn't even know why you applied for a table because I thought we had decided not to get one.

222
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,203
Speaker 0: I was going to apply anyway.

223
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:19,260
Speaker 0: I was going to basically sublet it to the best artist I could find who didn't get a table.

224
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:20,700
Speaker 0: That was my plan.

225
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,419
Speaker 0: And then in return, in the corner of the table, they was there to sell some Geek Night t-shirts.

226
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:25,366
Speaker 1: Alright.

227
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:26,474
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

228
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,300
Speaker 1: if that could have happened.

229
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,919
Speaker 0: Alright, so you're all down and everything would have gotten in the news.

230
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,104
Speaker 1: What do I have in the news?

231
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:40,680
Speaker 1: Well, there is a thing called, for many, many years now, I have known of a thing called the Guin Saga.

232
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,017
Speaker 1: If you would have come up to me and said Guin Saga, I'd be like, "Yeah, I heard of that, but I have no idea what it

233
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:45,218
Speaker 1: is.".

234
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:49,339
Speaker 1: And in more recent years, I have come to learn what it is.

235
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:52,800
Speaker 1: It's an epic fantasy story.

236
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:59,375
Speaker 1: It was originally in a bunch of actual books with some illustrations, like 126 volumes worth.

237
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:07,697
Speaker 1: There was a manga that told some side story that came out from Vertical that I read.

238
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:08,660
Speaker 1: that's like three volumes.

239
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:12,360
Speaker 1: And there's a brand new anime series, which I'm watching and is pretty awesome.

240
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:17,759
Speaker 1: And it's about this guy and he has a leopard for a head and he doesn't know why.

241
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:26,460
Speaker 1: And he's in his fantasy world and there's all sorts of kings and princes and war and all that typical fantasy stuff and wizards and whatnot.

242
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:38,960
Speaker 1: Well, it is very sad news, but Kaworu Kurimoto, the original creator of the Guin Saga, has passed away from, was it pancreatic cancer?

243
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:42,008
Speaker 1: At the age of 50-something, 53 I think.

244
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,880
Speaker 1: I don't have my laptop in front of me, so I don't remember the very specific details.

245
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:50,939
Speaker 1: So this leaves me, number one, it's sort of like, "Wow, that's pretty

246
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:51,180
Speaker 1: big.".

247
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:57,020
Speaker 1: Pretty much the number two fantasy series in all of history after The Lord of the Rings.

248
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,887
Speaker 1: It's done, right?

249
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,505
Speaker 1: And 126 volumes, it's like, "Is it over?

250
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,687
Speaker 1: Was she working on more?

251
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,210
Speaker 1: What's the situation going to be

252
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,350
Speaker 1: there?".

253
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:18,880
Speaker 1: People were freaking out about the Robert Jordan situation, the Guin Saga situation could be a billion times worse than that.

254
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:29,320
Speaker 1: And it's like, just as I was starting to get into it, as soon as I really figured out what it was and started liking it and started trying to read it, then this goes on.

255
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,861
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh,

256
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:30,423
Speaker 1: God.".

257
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:32,872
Speaker 1: So that is a sad news for the world.

258
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,880
Speaker 0: That indeed.

259
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,384
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

260
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:49,396
Speaker 0: Now, we were at Anime Boston, and one of the highlights of Anime Boston was the Calafina concert.

261
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:51,160
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of that.

262
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,540
Speaker 1: You sure it's not Calafina?

263
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard Calafina from just about everyone.

264
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:56,780
Speaker 1: I was just trying to be silly.

265
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,379
Speaker 0: But I did eat at Chipotle for lunch today.

266
00:15:58,861 --> 00:15:59,246
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

267
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:00,220
Speaker 1: Chipotle.

268
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:09,800
Speaker 0: But, in case you don't know who Calafina was, I'm linking to some Calafina videos on YouTube that probably won't be taken down in the near term.

269
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:14,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just sort of hate linking to anything that I know is going to be taken down.

270
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,487
Speaker 0: It may or may not be taken down.

271
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:16,916
Speaker 0: I mean, copyright law in the U.S.

272
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:17,540
Speaker 0: is all weird.

273
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:18,722
Speaker 1: It's true.

274
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:19,888
Speaker 1: Okay.

275
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:21,456
Speaker 1: Is that it?

276
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,300
Speaker 1: That's all you got?

277
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,620
Speaker 0: There's nothing else on the internet.

278
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,321
Speaker 1: Okay.

279
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:27,248
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is a very small thing of the day.

280
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:32,520
Speaker 1: In fact, we're going to include, for the first time ever, the entire thing of the day in this show.

281
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:36,000
Speaker 1: So you do not, if you want to hear, it's an audio thing of the day, right?

282
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:40,780
Speaker 1: If you want to hear this thing of the day, you do not need to go to the website or click on the link.

283
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:43,199
Speaker 0: Should we just play it without explaining what it is?

284
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,497
Speaker 1: Just play it right now.

285
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,200
Speaker 1: Alright, so, for those of you who, we should have played it a few times, actually, so people can, you know, hear it over and over.

286
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,840
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll play it again after I'm done talking.

287
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:03,157
Speaker 1: What that was, was a correct pronunciation of...

288
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:05,915
Speaker 0: Mjölnir.

289
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,358
Speaker 1: No, not Mjölnir.

290
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,460
Speaker 0: Well, it was the correct pronunciation of Mjölnir, just like Nobunaga is the correct pronunciation of Nobunga.

291
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:32,820
Speaker 1: Yes, you see, Mjölnir is the name of Thor's hammer, a very important geek artifact in both the land of comic books, but also the land of Norse mythology.

292
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,000
Speaker 0: So what's the name of Odin's horse?

293
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,375
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

294
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,600
Speaker 0: How about the name of the Rainbow Bridge?

295
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:39,799
Speaker 1: Rainbow Bridge.

296
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,716
Speaker 0: Or the guy who guards it.

297
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:42,338
Speaker 1: I forget.

298
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Speaker 0: Or the place where the gods dwell.

299
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:47,400
Speaker 0: Or the place where you don't know anything but the Marvel stuff.

300
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,839
Speaker 1: You're making me think too quickly.

301
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:50,300
Speaker 1: Anyway.

302
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,500
Speaker 0: I just wanted to point out that you said, you know, Marvel and Norse mythology, when you really meant Marvel.

303
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:57,839
Speaker 0: Mjölnir.

304
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,040
Speaker 1: Well, no, because Norse mythology on its own is not important enough to geekery.

305
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:02,898
Speaker 0: I think it is.

306
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,260
Speaker 1: It is Thor the superhero that creates the extra impetus of geeky importance.

307
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,061
Speaker 0: Are you really sure?

308
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:18,700
Speaker 0: Because I know that in middle school and high school, being doing like quiz bowl and stuff, every nerd knew everything there was to know about Norse mythology above and beyond every other mythology.

309
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:28,440
Speaker 1: In order for your evidence, your anecdotal evidence to be valid in this argument, your anecdotal evidence would have to be from a time before Thor the Marvel superhero existed.

310
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,983
Speaker 1: Would it be?

311
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:32,640
Speaker 0: Because of all those people, no one I knew read comic books.

312
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:33,645
Speaker 0: That did not matter.

313
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,320
Speaker 1: The geeky interest was ancillary.

314
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,960
Speaker 0: See, I don't think it was because Thor is pretty badass.

315
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,737
Speaker 0: Can you prove it wasn't?

316
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:44,640
Speaker 0: However, I have an equally plausible supposition.

317
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,257
Speaker 1: The point is that we now know how to correctly pronounce Mjölnir.

318
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,130
Speaker 1: And the way you spell it is M-J-O-2-dots-L-N-I-R.

319
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:59,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, I have the equally valid or possible plausible supposition.

320
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,700
Speaker 0: We know why you have plausible suppositions here.

321
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,940
Speaker 0: The interest in Norse mythology among geeks comes primarily from metal.

322
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,302
Speaker 1: Mjölnir.

323
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:12,990
Speaker 1: Mjölnir.

324
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:15,659
Speaker 1: Mjölnir.

325
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,599
Speaker 1: Alright, if you don't shut up, I'll hit you with Mjölnir.

326
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:20,706
Speaker 1: Mjölnir.

327
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:30,960
Speaker 0: But anyway, Anime Boston 2009, the short version, in case you want to listen to all of this, is that it was badass and we were coming to every Anime Boston again forever.

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,070
Speaker 1: Unless it goes down the tubes.

329
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,560
Speaker 1: I mean, we said Kazukan was badass.

330
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,447
Speaker 0: Kazukan was badass.

331
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:37,533
Speaker 1: It may be badass again.

332
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,300
Speaker 1: It could be possible that Anime Boston, a few years from now, will say Anime Boston was badass, but I hope not.

333
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,020
Speaker 0: I can at least say, Anime Boston is now in the permanent Geek Nights con rotation.

334
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:55,100
Speaker 0: It is now among the likes of Otakon, the New York Anime Festival, the New York Comic Con, PAX East, PAX West.

335
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,867
Speaker 1: So let me just sum up the story.

336
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:59,659
Speaker 1: We had never been to Anime Boston because of who knows why.

337
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,516
Speaker 0: Usually situations like, "Hey, you guys should go to Anime

338
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:03,898
Speaker 0: Boston.".

339
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,049
Speaker 0: Rim saying, "Anime Boston?

340
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's go.

341
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,276
Speaker 0: When is it?

342
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:07,999
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, last

343
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:08,160
Speaker 0: week.".

344
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,380
Speaker 1: Right, so we actually finally went because Dragon Master Lu is awesome and he's the man.

345
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:15,784
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

346
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:21,140
Speaker 1: We also, last year on Geek Nights, we didn't go to Anime Boston, obviously, because this was our first time going.

347
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,560
Speaker 1: But we heard from people that the registration at Anime Boston was horrendously bad.

348
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,199
Speaker 1: And it was.

349
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,283
Speaker 0: It was bad enough to where?

350
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:33,480
Speaker 0: had I gone to the previous year's Anime Boston, I probably would have backcharged the credit card.

351
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,283
Speaker 1: Exactly.

352
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:37,019
Speaker 1: So, we went this year.

353
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,720
Speaker 1: And, you know, we walk up and we're, you know, cautious.

354
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,340
Speaker 1: Cautiously optimistic as we are, right?

355
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,220
Speaker 0: Anytime we go to a new con, I mean, remember the first time we were doing panels at Kinetic Con?

356
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:54,620
Speaker 0: We show up like, there's always, you know, being people like us going to any convention, there's always the, "Is this convention going to have our badges for

357
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:54,680
Speaker 0: us?".

358
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,339
Speaker 1: Even at PAX, we were cautious for the first five minutes.

359
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,080
Speaker 0: Like, are they going to know who we are?

360
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,800
Speaker 1: Until we met that first enforcer who hooked us up.

361
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,402
Speaker 0: Are they going to give us what we need?

362
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:13,100
Speaker 0: Is it going to, I'm not going to name cons, but are we going to have to find a schedule, fake our way in to get badges, then look on the schedule to figure out where our panels were scheduled?

363
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:13,561
Speaker 0: Right.

364
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:17,070
Speaker 1: So, we go to Anime Boston and at first, we're a little bit.

365
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,473
Speaker 1: eh, a little bit, right?

366
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,340
Speaker 1: You know, we're not, we don't know our way around this convention center so much.

367
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,858
Speaker 0: I want to say so much eh, is that we walk in.

368
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:23,980
Speaker 1: We're only a little bit eh.

369
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,815
Speaker 0: And we ask one of the staffers walking by, "Excuse me, good sir, where can we go to get panelist badges if we are a featured

370
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:31,236
Speaker 0: panelist?".

371
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,859
Speaker 0: And they say, "Registration is that

372
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:33,040
Speaker 0: way.".

373
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:37,720
Speaker 1: And we're like, because we had thought that because of the email, right, which Rym did not have.

374
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:42,560
Speaker 0: Uh, Scott, the email said exactly go to the customer service desk, as I said at the con.

375
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,620
Speaker 1: You were not so sure about that.

376
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,149
Speaker 0: I was 100% sure.

377
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,724
Speaker 1: No, that's not what you said.

378
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,577
Speaker 1: You were like, "Yeah, the email said to go somewhere special,

379
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:49,979
Speaker 1: eh.".

380
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,680
Speaker 0: Yep, it said go to customer service.

381
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,006
Speaker 1: In fact, I think in the car you said information desk.

382
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:59,360
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point was we were not 100% sure where to go and the person said to go to.

383
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:00,189
Speaker 0: I was 100% sure.

384
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,606
Speaker 1: No, you were not.

385
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,272
Speaker 1: Not at all.

386
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,280
Speaker 1: You're basically lying.

387
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:03,872
Speaker 1: Okay.

388
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:04,355
Speaker 1: Yes.

389
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,980
Speaker 0: So anyway, you know, we get in line and there's a little bit of a line.

390
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Speaker 0: The only complaint, this is like the only complaint I have about all of Anime Boston, is that they make the same mistake Otacon does with registration.

391
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,280
Speaker 0: They have all these booths set up for pre-registration and ad-con registration and they have one booth on the end for special cases.

392
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,120
Speaker 0: Anyone who has a problem, their registration wasn't there, their badge was wrong, they need a special badge.

393
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,940
Speaker 0: Anyone who has something weird going on has to go to this one booth.

394
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:38,300
Speaker 0: So as a result, in the time it takes a normal booth to process like 100 people, the special booth processes one person.

395
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:38,899
Speaker 1: Yep.

396
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,100
Speaker 0: It took us like a half hour to stand in a line with like seven people in front of us to get our badge.

397
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:53,980
Speaker 1: You do need to have A, a separate booth for the, you know, you can't have the same booth servicing people with problems and panelists and guests getting badges.

398
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,922
Speaker 1: There needs to be two booths.

399
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:59,294
Speaker 1: And secondly, the problem booth, right?

400
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:01,680
Speaker 1: It could be just one booth for the problem people.

401
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:08,780
Speaker 1: But the thing is, if someone's got a problem, you really need like an excellent staffer there because these are people who are going to like that.

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,900
Speaker 1: Their whole convention is going to be determined by their experience at that booth because they have a problem.

403
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:17,900
Speaker 1: And how elegantly it is solved is pretty much going to change their whole attitude.

404
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,960
Speaker 0: The only reason I complain about this is that Otacon had the exact same problem.

405
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,840
Speaker 0: And to actually get our panelists badges, we had to stand in a line that took longer than the entire normal registration line.

406
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,141
Speaker 1: Right.

407
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:33,400
Speaker 1: So what you need to do is at the one booth for special case people, right?

408
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,300
Speaker 1: You need to have like two or three of like your best freaking staffers there.

409
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:46,860
Speaker 1: Like until that line is empty or, you know, just to make sure, because that's pretty much you, you found that you have a clever opportunity.

410
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,840
Speaker 1: It's like your only golden opportunity to put all the problem people at the con in one spot and then kick them out the door and then help.

411
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,180
Speaker 1: Right.

412
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,802
Speaker 1: And fix them.

413
00:23:54,882 --> 00:23:55,103
Speaker 1: Right.

414
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:57,511
Speaker 1: So don't squander that opportunity.

415
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:00,460
Speaker 1: Put the big staffers there and keep them there until it's fixed.

416
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,402
Speaker 0: But anyway, we finally get up to the front.

417
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:15,280
Speaker 0: And this is the moment of truth, because every con may like the quality we experience we have as like panelists or guests or whatever really is always indicated by whether or not they actually have our badges ready for us.

418
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:19,152
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, I'm rim and there's a Scott and we're here and they're like, here's your badges.

419
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:21,540
Speaker 1: And from then on, everything is great.

420
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,660
Speaker 0: And they handed us our badges and like everything was just brilliant from that point forward.

421
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,560
Speaker 1: The only other, the only negative thing to say, in fact, there's only two other negative things to say about the con and they're not very negative.

422
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:40,520
Speaker 1: Number one, the registration was infinity times better than the registration the previous year, which, you know, I only know about from hearsay, but it was bad.

423
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,085
Speaker 0: However, however, does it twice as good.

424
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:50,840
Speaker 0: But not to not to talk about Otacon, Pax, like I thought Otacon, I always looked at Otacon as like the best con in the world for handing registration.

425
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:56,296
Speaker 0: They they take that crazy line on Thursday and it is gone like right away.

426
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:57,600
Speaker 0: Like they're so fast.

427
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:04,940
Speaker 0: But then we went to Pax and there was no line because they mailed everyone their badges.

428
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,480
Speaker 0: Now it's interesting because every anime con like Otacon, Anime Boston, Katsucon, Kineticon, every con, they say, no, it's impossible to mail out the badges.

429
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,408
Speaker 0: But Pax just does it and it just works.

430
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:19,360
Speaker 1: And I think it's when they worry about, oh, somebody is going to forge the badges.

431
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:20,582
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

432
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:21,966
Speaker 0: So we can't mail them out.

433
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:27,220
Speaker 1: Then again, the New York Comic Cons and the New York Anime Festival, that badge is such an easily forged badge.

434
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,790
Speaker 1: It's the same exact thing as like the Anime Boston Otacon badges.

435
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,760
Speaker 1: It's a piece of paper and a piece of plastic with a hologram on it.

436
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,021
Speaker 1: Right.

437
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:35,627
Speaker 1: They mail them out.

438
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:36,992
Speaker 1: They have no problem.

439
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:37,574
Speaker 1: They don't care.

440
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,040
Speaker 1: And their tickets are a lot more money.

441
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,486
Speaker 1: In fact, you could probably you can forge a badge.

442
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:46,940
Speaker 1: The New York Comic Con, that could be like a five hundred dollar badge that lets you see Stan Lee trivial to forge.

443
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:47,542
Speaker 1: Right.

444
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:48,648
Speaker 1: They just mail it to you.

445
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:49,411
Speaker 1: They don't care.

446
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:51,080
Speaker 1: They don't force you to get it at con.

447
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:56,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like Pax showed me the light in that regard that just hire a company, mail out badges.

448
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,735
Speaker 1: I'm done with the excuses of not mailing out badges at conventions.

449
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:00,620
Speaker 1: You mail them out.

450
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,840
Speaker 1: Right.

451
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:11,280
Speaker 1: Because while the badge, the registration situation at Anime Boston was satisfactory and it was infinitely superior than previous year, that line still was too long.

452
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,287
Speaker 1: Our friend came for a Saturday only badge.

453
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,756
Speaker 1: He bought it at door and he had to wait over an hour.

454
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,860
Speaker 1: And that is too long.

455
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,470
Speaker 1: You know, it's significantly better, but too long.

456
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,776
Speaker 1: And that's the only.

457
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:21,820
Speaker 1: that's one negative thing.

458
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,780
Speaker 1: And the only other negative thing was that, you know, you have a board at each door to every room in the con.

459
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,121
Speaker 1: Right.

460
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:29,149
Speaker 0: Tiny font, tiny font.

461
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,000
Speaker 1: You have to basically, you know, it's like the outside panel room.

462
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:40,759
Speaker 1: A you have a piece of cardboard on an easel and it has the schedule for panel A. It's on a little tiny eight and a half by 11 piece of paper or like a 14 point font.

463
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,980
Speaker 1: So you need to walk up to it and basically squint at it to read what the schedule is.

464
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:50,820
Speaker 1: It should be in big, big letters that you can see it just walking down the hallway.

465
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:53,839
Speaker 1: And other than that, anime Boston was pretty much perfect for what it was.

466
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,200
Speaker 0: We figured we'd get the all the negatives out of the way first, because otherwise we do like other years coverage of other conventions where we end on all the bad stuff.

467
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,601
Speaker 1: Yeah.

468
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:02,284
Speaker 1: Everything else.

469
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,409
Speaker 1: I mean, Boston was perfect.

470
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:03,851
Speaker 1: Perfect.

471
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:05,237
Speaker 1: No, no, no complaints.

472
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:05,880
Speaker 1: Nothing was wrong.

473
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,063
Speaker 0: The panels were amazing.

474
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,330
Speaker 0: We'll just take it where we will go chronologically.

475
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,499
Speaker 0: I don't think you need the minute by minute account of this.

476
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,616
Speaker 1: I mean, do we really need to like review all of our panels that we gave?

477
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:17,360
Speaker 1: It's not really.

478
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,200
Speaker 0: We should talk about what happened each of the panels, because I think they're all noteworthy in some way.

479
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,625
Speaker 0: I mean, we basically got to the count.

480
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:27,080
Speaker 0: We walked around and then our first panel on Friday was of all things beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

481
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,575
Speaker 0: And there were a little there between two and three hundred people in that room.

482
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:31,640
Speaker 1: It was it was pretty crowded.

483
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,475
Speaker 1: Did you notice that people like to sit adjacent to the aisle in the middle?

484
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,157
Speaker 1: Yeah.

485
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:36,780
Speaker 1: What was that?

486
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,929
Speaker 1: You know, it was weird because it's a bit I did too.

487
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:41,520
Speaker 0: When I went into rooms, I always sat like right there.

488
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:42,624
Speaker 1: I didn't sit there.

489
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:43,186
Speaker 0: I did.

490
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,495
Speaker 1: I sat more in the middle of one of the sides.

491
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:46,900
Speaker 1: That's where I like to sit anyway.

492
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:47,442
Speaker 0: Yeah.

493
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:52,920
Speaker 0: But in terms of panel rooms, anime Boston, outside of packs, had the best panel rooms I've ever seen.

494
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,960
Speaker 0: Because even Otakon, even all the other big anime conventions, they usually have one set of speakers at the front of the room and the microphones and everything.

495
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,160
Speaker 0: And the average two pretty good tech guys and every count union tech guys.

496
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:16,800
Speaker 0: But anime Boston's panel rooms and showing rooms, I point out one had dedicated staff in every panel room and showing room for the entirety of the con that knew their stuff like they were perfect.

497
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,669
Speaker 1: They that guy in Ballroom A, he helped us out.

498
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,091
Speaker 1: What's up?

499
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,037
Speaker 0: Ballroom A guy was so great.

500
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:22,900
Speaker 0: Like we're standing there.

501
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,000
Speaker 0: We're like, oh, if only that like wireless mics and he hands us to wireless mics like he ninjas behind us.

502
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,404
Speaker 1: And they worked.

503
00:28:30,728 --> 00:28:31,310
Speaker 1: They worked.

504
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,300
Speaker 1: That's not often they have wireless mics that work.

505
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,636
Speaker 0: They had one better projectors, gigantic projectors that also work.

506
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:40,920
Speaker 0: And the panel rooms were gigantic.

507
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:44,860
Speaker 0: I mean, Ballroom A seated, I think seven hundred and twenty people.

508
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:55,860
Speaker 1: And most importantly, in that giant room, there were six speakers, two in the front, two sort of halfway and two in the middle so that everyone throughout the entire room could hear what was coming out the microphone.

509
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,360
Speaker 0: Even if you were sitting way in the back, you didn't have that situation in most other counts where the front of the room is crazy loud in the back of the room.

510
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,404
Speaker 0: You can't hear anything.

511
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:06,860
Speaker 0: And it made for a much more dynamic, much more into it, much more focused panels.

512
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,364
Speaker 0: People were enjoying a more.

513
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:13,900
Speaker 0: just in general, the panel set of Anime Boston beats the crap out of pretty much every other convention we go to.

514
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,195
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it was, you know, fewer larger rooms for the panels.

515
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:19,018
Speaker 1: That's one thing.

516
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:19,540
Speaker 1: Right.

517
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:27,497
Speaker 1: And the other thing was that, you know, there were stretches of the con where there weren't any panels to go to.

518
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:28,640
Speaker 1: that like we were interested in.

519
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,445
Speaker 1: But there were always things going on.

520
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,859
Speaker 1: You know, it was just for us, it sort of felt like, you know, at points where we had nothing to do.

521
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:40,334
Speaker 1: Like Saturday morning, for example, was sort of like, OK, right.

522
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:41,277
Speaker 1: You know.

523
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:42,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

524
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,828
Speaker 0: But then again, I mean, what do I do at a con?

525
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:48,420
Speaker 0: I tend to go to about half events and then I tend to hang out with people and have fun for the other half.

526
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:48,981
Speaker 1: Exactly.

527
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,468
Speaker 0: I mean, you need time to go and eat and all that stuff.

528
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:56,140
Speaker 0: And plus, I would say, looking at the schedule, there was something to do at that con.

529
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,063
Speaker 1: Just not for us.

530
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:58,951
Speaker 0: At pretty much any point in the con.

531
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:00,236
Speaker 0: I would have gone and played some DDR.

532
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,040
Speaker 0: You didn't really want to.

533
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:03,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't want to play DDR in that smelly room.

534
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:05,233
Speaker 0: The room wasn't smelly until Saturday night.

535
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:07,520
Speaker 1: Well, it was smelly up by the DDR real close.

536
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,503
Speaker 0: Not on Friday.

537
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:09,929
Speaker 1: Maybe not Friday.

538
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,500
Speaker 0: Only it wasn't until Saturday night that that room smelled.

539
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,854
Speaker 1: I really wanted to play GoGo 13 slot machine, but there were.

540
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:17,160
Speaker 1: no I didn't know how to make it work.

541
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,004
Speaker 0: Put a quarter in.

542
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,400
Speaker 1: I wasn't going to put my quarter in someone else's slot machine.

543
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,085
Speaker 0: What if it won?

544
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:22,648
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

545
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,314
Speaker 1: I couldn't trust that there were quarters in it.

546
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:25,900
Speaker 1: It was not, you know, it was not a license.

547
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,660
Speaker 0: You weren't willing to spend a quarter to see the Duke Togo do whatever he does on that machine.

548
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:34,159
Speaker 1: I don't gamble unless there is a gambling commission keeping it straight.

549
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,203
Speaker 1: Not that they keep it straight.

550
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:43,940
Speaker 1: Well, plus, you know, I know I could have put that quarter in that machine and Duke Togo would like blow my brains out.

551
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,760
Speaker 0: I would have bet on Duke Togo because a man who will shoot a guy on his way down.

552
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,649
Speaker 1: Well, that's the thing is you're not betting on Duke Togo.

553
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:50,855
Speaker 1: You're betting against Duke Togo.

554
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:51,820
Speaker 1: You're trying to get his money.

555
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:52,402
Speaker 0: Are you?

556
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:52,964
Speaker 0: Are you really?

557
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:56,980
Speaker 0: What if your quarter is paying him to take out that slot machine?

558
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:57,925
Speaker 1: It's not.

559
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:59,715
Speaker 1: He's in the slot machine coming out.

560
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:00,740
Speaker 1: Not the advice.

561
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,760
Speaker 0: He's got a gun pointed right out the slot.

562
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,655
Speaker 1: It would only be betting for him if you were Duke Togo using the slot machine.

563
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:09,180
Speaker 1: Anyway.

564
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:18,540
Speaker 0: But, you know, Beyond D&D got a lot of people and it was pretty interesting to see all these anime people who were also really into role playing games.

565
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was actually kind of, I didn't think the turnout was going to be that much, what it was.

566
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,940
Speaker 1: But one thing that I think we, it's something I knew we needed to fix with that panel and I thought we did fix it, but I guess not.

567
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,099
Speaker 1: Is that, you know, the way we deliver that panel is we use D&D as the example all the time because everyone knows D&D.

568
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,640
Speaker 1: So that's what you, you know, you're going to be saying D&D a lot.

569
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:45,600
Speaker 1: And the result is it sort of comes off in the panel as if we're bashing on D&D, which we are not.

570
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,254
Speaker 0: Nevermind the fact that we began the panel with a five minute explanation of.

571
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:50,078
Speaker 0: we love D&D.

572
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,543
Speaker 0: D&D is awesome.

573
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:52,205
Speaker 0: It's important.

574
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:52,887
Speaker 0: We play it.

575
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,529
Speaker 0: It's great.

576
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,719
Speaker 0: D&D is awesome and do not think that we are in any way disparaging D&D.

577
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,183
Speaker 1: That doesn't help, right?

578
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:05,420
Speaker 1: So I do think we need to basically re-, just not use the word D&D or Dungeons & Dragons as much.

579
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:05,761
Speaker 1: One thing

580
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:18,519
Speaker 0: I did notice at this panel that has never happened to us at another convention before, and I don't know if just because of the crowd or the nature of the room or what, but in all the panels we did, people in the audience would like just start interrupting and yelling stuff at us.

581
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:30,038
Speaker 0: Like in every panel, like say, say something and someone in the back of the room would just start yelling like a comment like, but you guys forgot about going to guys work, the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

582
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:33,170
Speaker 1: And you just don't say, don't acknowledge them.

583
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:35,460
Speaker 1: Otherwise you're going to lose control of your panel.

584
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:35,780
Speaker 0: Yep.

585
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,725
Speaker 0: But it was interesting that this happened.

586
00:32:37,745 --> 00:32:43,600
Speaker 0: Like it happened a lot at Anime Boston and it's never happened at any other con except once at Kineticon.

587
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:44,398
Speaker 0: That's true.

588
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,226
Speaker 0: And it wasn't just our panels.

589
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,500
Speaker 0: Pretty much every panel I went to had people in the audience interrupting.

590
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,770
Speaker 0: And it was actually the same, as far as I could tell, like the same people.

591
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,560
Speaker 0: Like there were like 50 or 60 people who seemed to be the ones who kept doing it.

592
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:03,400
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there was this one panel we went to, it was these two girls and they gave a panel about murder mystery manga.

593
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:07,619
Speaker 1: And you know, it was an average panel, you know, and they had a very good list of murder mystery manga.

594
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,040
Speaker 0: I learned about two murder mystery manga I did not know about.

595
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,281
Speaker 0: Yes.

596
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:15,320
Speaker 1: I also I took the hands out on a nice piece of paper that had a list of all the manga they were talking about, which is very nice.

597
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,680
Speaker 1: Their slides had a really good design, but they had a lot of text on them and, you know, a lot of text on slides is not so good.

598
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,600
Speaker 1: But anyway, you know, so I learned about good murder mystery manga.

599
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,360
Speaker 1: So it's worth my time to sit in that panel, but like someone just blurted out a question and then they answered it.

600
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,080
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like, no, you're supposed to make them wait to the end and raise their hand and such and such.

601
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:36,454
Speaker 0: I'm curious as to what the phenomenon was.

602
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,400
Speaker 0: It wasn't really a detriment.

603
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,600
Speaker 0: It was just really interesting because some of the people who would yell stuff out did have really interesting things to say.

604
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,440
Speaker 1: Yeah.

605
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:50,900
Speaker 0: And I feel like I feel as a result, Anime Boston could host some panels that we don't even try to run at other conventions.

606
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,680
Speaker 0: We could host some serious like roundtable discussion style panels.

607
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:55,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

608
00:33:55,421 --> 00:34:06,840
Speaker 1: I feel like, though, either A, we need to make like the Beyond D&D panel shorter, like remove some content from it, or we need to get more time for it so we can take questions.

609
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,460
Speaker 0: Because pretty much the problem with doing a panel that says controversial things is that I mean, it was weird looking around the audience.

610
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:19,139
Speaker 0: I'd say half the people like I'd say something and the audience, like people, they'd be like nodding like seriously.

611
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:20,946
Speaker 0: Oh, I get it.

612
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:23,980
Speaker 0: But there'd be an equal number of people going, those guys are wrong.

613
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:25,971
Speaker 0: And they'd raise their hand like, I got to say something.

614
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:26,795
Speaker 1: I got to say something.

615
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:27,458
Speaker 1: I got to say something.

616
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:33,100
Speaker 1: Or there's the people out there like, you know, there are people who know more about animes and mangas and stuff than we do.

617
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,442
Speaker 1: Right.

618
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:34,830
Speaker 1: We are not the know it alls.

619
00:34:34,931 --> 00:34:35,051
Speaker 1: Right.

620
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:36,420
Speaker 1: That's why we had to throw out with us.

621
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,676
Speaker 1: So, you know, there are people out in the audience who know more than you and they might have something to add.

622
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:42,780
Speaker 1: that is, you know, new information.

623
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,708
Speaker 1: But sometimes they're not so eloquent.

624
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,074
Speaker 1: Sometimes they are right.

625
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:48,020
Speaker 1: Some, you know, et cetera.

626
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,745
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of variables there.

627
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:55,060
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like, you know, I want to hear what they got to say because it's obviously something I don't know.

628
00:34:55,542 --> 00:35:00,080
Speaker 1: But if they can't say it concisely and well, I don't want them to talk during my panel.

629
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,400
Speaker 1: Here's the thing, though, and be if they do, if they're that smart and they know these things, they should have their own panel.

630
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,280
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing that's really interesting about anime Boston with all of that, more so than at any other convention.

631
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,540
Speaker 0: And this is partly because the panels were all the ones I went to, like every panel I went to was pretty damn good.

632
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:20,913
Speaker 0: Like the weakest panel I saw was well above average for anime cons.

633
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:22,839
Speaker 0: And I saw some really good panels, too.

634
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:31,700
Speaker 0: But after every panel, like, you know, at Otakon or Katsucon or something, there'll be like 20 or 30 people who come up to the front of the room and want to talk to the people given the panel afterward.

635
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:36,920
Speaker 0: But at this con, like mobs would come to the front of the room and not want to leave.

636
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was sort of we had to like, you know, move people along.

637
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,903
Speaker 0: And again, it wasn't just us.

638
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,087
Speaker 0: A lot of people had this problem.

639
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:47,260
Speaker 1: And I think every panel was very punctual in the ending and starting times.

640
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,343
Speaker 0: Yes, yes, they were.

641
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:54,880
Speaker 0: But I think the way to solve this is to schedule panels the way Pax does, where every room needs a half hour period between each panel.

642
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,100
Speaker 1: Fifteen minutes.

643
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,540
Speaker 0: Well, no, a half hour and you dedicate, you know, the first 15 minutes of that to Q&A, wind the crowd down while the other people set up.

644
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:07,659
Speaker 0: And then you clear out the room and have another 15 minutes of silence.

645
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:08,880
Speaker 1: That's all right.

646
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,494
Speaker 0: Because the 15 minutes, knowing that there's that buffer, you can get all that kind of bustle of.

647
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:15,400
Speaker 0: I want to talk to the panelists, oh, my God, out of the way.

648
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:15,988
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

649
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:16,680
Speaker 1: That's true.

650
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,665
Speaker 0: The other option would be to have allow some.

651
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:23,638
Speaker 1: if you're going to do the half hour, though, you need to have, you know, remember, they had fewer, bigger panel rooms.

652
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:24,440
Speaker 1: that made Boston.

653
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,700
Speaker 1: So having these half hour gaps, that's a lot of content you're losing.

654
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:35,000
Speaker 1: If you have, say, four panel rooms instead of, you know, you have more of them, you can stagger the scheduling and then the half hour emptiness won't matter.

655
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,080
Speaker 0: Now, normally here in most kinds, here's where I'd say, yeah, we'll get rid of the video showing rooms and do and do that instead.

656
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 0: But anime Boston had better anime showings than pretty much.

657
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:44,172
Speaker 1: You could see the subtitles.

658
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:45,100
Speaker 1: It was nice and quiet.

659
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,426
Speaker 1: In fact, they were in.

660
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:49,460
Speaker 1: one of them was in this hotel that was attached to the convention center.

661
00:36:49,961 --> 00:36:56,640
Speaker 1: It was like a movie theater because you went in one door and then there was a little lobby area and then there was another set of doors.

662
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:03,400
Speaker 1: So there was no way that the hallway traffic could interfere with the quiet, dark video showing room.

663
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,280
Speaker 1: It was like an actual movie theater is awesome, but really interesting.

664
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:15,260
Speaker 1: Now, that is, you know, I can't dis other conventions for not having that because that's just a, you know, luck of the way the hotel is arranged, you know, the the architecture of it.

665
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:20,600
Speaker 1: But, you know, you could sort of get close by doing sort of like, you know, curtains on sticks situation.

666
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:25,280
Speaker 0: But the really cool thing, I walked in and I watched like 15 minutes of innocence, that whole golem scene.

667
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:26,110
Speaker 0: I just watched that again.

668
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:26,778
Speaker 0: It happened to be on.

669
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:34,640
Speaker 0: But in these rooms, there were a ton of people watching anime, like a ton in all the video rooms they had.

670
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:47,100
Speaker 0: And looking at the schedule, they didn't fall into the trap that a lot of other anime cons do where they'll show like, you know, episodes five through 11 of some TV show or like long stretches of some anime TV show.

671
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,359
Speaker 0: A lot of the showings were movies, one offs or like the beginnings of shows.

672
00:37:52,061 --> 00:38:07,740
Speaker 0: And in general, like if you're going to do anime video rooms, either don't do them because they're a bad idea the way most people do them, or at least do them the way Anime Boston did, or have the live action violence like Chinese, Japanese, Korean movies, the Filipino stuff and all that cool thing, all the stuff in video five.

673
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,060
Speaker 1: They didn't have that, but you know, whatever.

674
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:15,419
Speaker 0: But the video rooms were good enough to where I wouldn't say get rid of them and make more panel groups.

675
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:16,281
Speaker 1: All right.

676
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:20,430
Speaker 1: So the artist's alley at Anime Boston was actually pretty big.

677
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,580
Speaker 1: It was like maybe half, a little less than half the size of the Otacon.

678
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Speaker 0: I'd say a quarter.

679
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,722
Speaker 1: Quarter and maybe.

680
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:32,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was still very, very large, much larger than I thought it would be.

681
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,958
Speaker 1: There was maybe 100 tables, if not more, maybe 150 tables.

682
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,707
Speaker 0: It was it was it was still small.

683
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:42,780
Speaker 0: I mean, compared to Otacon, clearly, but it was a sizable artist's alley.

684
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,980
Speaker 0: The quality was it was the best artist's alley I've ever seen outside of Otacon.

685
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,300
Speaker 1: Yeah.

686
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,168
Speaker 1: I mean, there was a large variety of different things that were very, very awesome.

687
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:55,757
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, you had crafts, you had arts, you had fan arts, original arts.

688
00:38:55,777 --> 00:38:56,960
Speaker 1: There was an indie comics guy.

689
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:57,945
Speaker 1: Oh, that was right.

690
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,354
Speaker 1: We talked to this awesome indie comic guy.

691
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,180
Speaker 1: You got his card over there?

692
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,024
Speaker 0: I got his card.

693
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:01,890
Speaker 0: We'll talk about him later.

694
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,660
Speaker 0: We're going to interview him and stuff in the future.

695
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:05,463
Speaker 1: I just wanted to give him a prop.

696
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:14,560
Speaker 1: Basically, he was talking about how, you know, he tries to sell his indie comic at the comic cons and people will talk to him, but they won't buy his stuff because, like, they only buy Spider-Man for the Silver Age.

697
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,789
Speaker 1: But at the anime cons, he says, like, this is awesome.

698
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:18,852
Speaker 1: Everyone's buying my shit.

699
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,460
Speaker 1: So that was pretty cool.

700
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,507
Speaker 0: He basically this is his first anime con.

701
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:25,314
Speaker 0: And he's like, I'm never going back to comic cons.

702
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,720
Speaker 0: Like every anime con I can now.

703
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

704
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,525
Speaker 1: You know, and his stuff wasn't even anime.

705
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:31,089
Speaker 1: He was just an indie comics dude.

706
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:33,974
Speaker 1: And he had his, you know, little mini comics and he was going to make a trade.

707
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:36,860
Speaker 1: And I was like, dude, when you have a trade, I'm so buying it just because you're awesome.

708
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,637
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's the kind of shit that was going down the, you know, the anime Boston artist alley.

709
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:43,480
Speaker 1: It was totally great.

710
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,470
Speaker 0: Well, the cool thing was it looked like a lot of fun.

711
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,260
Speaker 1: People sat at their tables the whole time.

712
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:54,291
Speaker 0: I'd say the room was about 60, 70 percent crafty or social currency kind of stuff.

713
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,876
Speaker 0: And then the rest was art, like straight up art.

714
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:57,296
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

715
00:39:57,597 --> 00:39:59,420
Speaker 0: there weren't that many people selling prints and everything.

716
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,628
Speaker 0: It was mostly people selling crafts and interesting stuff.

717
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:04,811
Speaker 0: that wasn't just.

718
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,316
Speaker 0: there was some good sushi pillows in the corner.

719
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:08,478
Speaker 1: There was some good origamis.

720
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,786
Speaker 0: There were a lot of crafty plushy things like that.

721
00:40:12,307 --> 00:40:12,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

722
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:13,089
Speaker 1: It was.

723
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:15,354
Speaker 1: it was a pretty happening artist alley.

724
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:17,138
Speaker 1: I spent some times in there.

725
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:17,900
Speaker 1: Good times.

726
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,253
Speaker 0: Dealers room was surprising because there was one big dealers room and it was.

727
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:24,200
Speaker 0: it was one of the better dealers rooms I've seen.

728
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,385
Speaker 1: You know what it reminded me of?

729
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:28,000
Speaker 1: It reminded me of that anime next dealers room only twice as big.

730
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,549
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, we walk around the whole room and everyone's like, yeah, there's a second section.

731
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:34,960
Speaker 0: So we finish and we're like, oh, let's go to the second section, then leave.

732
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:37,445
Speaker 0: And it looks like it's just like this tiny alcove.

733
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:44,120
Speaker 0: So we walk over there and just around the corner in the alcove is basically an entire other dealers room.

734
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just a big room that happened to have a separator that couldn't be moved, you know, which had bathrooms and stuff in it.

735
00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:57,020
Speaker 0: But notes from the dealers room one, the people selling cells were there and they had like they had one guy.

736
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's at Otacon, too.

737
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,445
Speaker 0: And I got.

738
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:00,908
Speaker 0: I almost bought a cell.

739
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:07,160
Speaker 1: He has the legitimate posters, the legitimate wall scrolls in the cells, and he just shows up at all the cons trying to sell him.

740
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,908
Speaker 1: He's totally old school and I see him all the time.

741
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:12,556
Speaker 1: And I bought my Galaxy Express poster from a while ago.

742
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,980
Speaker 1: I got to still frame that shit.

743
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, but notes of import.

744
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,759
Speaker 0: The ATV table was pretty sad.

745
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:19,899
Speaker 0: Yeah.

746
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:21,807
Speaker 1: The ATV is looking.

747
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:24,136
Speaker 1: it was looking worse than the CPM booth was looking.

748
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:25,100
Speaker 1: And what happened to CPM?

749
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, CPM booth was two years ago.

750
00:41:28,374 --> 00:41:29,880
Speaker 0: We bought all that anime for like one.

751
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,004
Speaker 1: One interesting thing from the ATV booth.

752
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:38,340
Speaker 1: They had 14 volumes of the five star stories, manga for two hundred dollars, all bundled up.

753
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,569
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, man, but I wasn't going to pay two hundred for it, you know, but I was.

754
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:50,100
Speaker 1: I was going to go back at two thirty and like offer him like one hundred and maybe settle for one fifty, you know, which would have been ten bucks.

755
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,404
Speaker 1: Per book.

756
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:52,026
Speaker 1: But I didn't.

757
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:53,831
Speaker 1: I just, you know, I'll still.

758
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,760
Speaker 1: no one bought it, obviously, because no one else wanted it there but me.

759
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,485
Speaker 1: But I'll I'll get him at Otacon.

760
00:41:58,526 --> 00:41:59,429
Speaker 0: But a comic copia.

761
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:02,318
Speaker 0: They had all of Phoenix for one hundred bucks.

762
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:02,860
Speaker 0: Ninety bucks.

763
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,425
Speaker 1: Alex, actually, Alex leave it.

764
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:06,553
Speaker 1: But volume six through the end.

765
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:08,400
Speaker 1: So they only have one through five still.

766
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,084
Speaker 1: But they're actually the harder ones to get.

767
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:10,405
Speaker 1: Right.

768
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:14,918
Speaker 0: And I was very happy that I got the first 15 volumes.

769
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,469
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's all of it or not of Dr.

770
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:17,750
Speaker 0: Slum.

771
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,740
Speaker 1: Let me look that up for fifty two dollars.

772
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:20,780
Speaker 1: Yeah.

773
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:24,630
Speaker 1: I mean, comic copia, if you know, is an awesome comic store.

774
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,800
Speaker 1: in is 18 volumes of the manga.

775
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,222
Speaker 0: All right.

776
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:30,466
Speaker 0: So I have to get three.

777
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:30,848
Speaker 1: Yeah.

778
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:31,831
Speaker 1: Maybe they're still coming out.

779
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,899
Speaker 1: I'll look at them on the preorder list for you.

780
00:42:34,983 --> 00:42:35,847
Speaker 0: I don't own all of Dr.

781
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:36,108
Speaker 0: Slump.

782
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:38,640
Speaker 0: It is vaguely continuously amusing.

783
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

784
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:42,960
Speaker 1: And we also happen to talk about it at our know your creators.

785
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:43,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

786
00:42:43,704 --> 00:42:45,174
Speaker 0: And that's part of the reason why I had to buy it.

787
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:46,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

788
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:54,994
Speaker 1: But like there were actually some pretty good deals on mangas and you could actually find, you know, because they these you know, we bought a volume of Eagle for ten five bucks.

789
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:56,440
Speaker 1: that we found, you know, volume four.

790
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,280
Speaker 0: Oh, the best was I forget what booth we're at, but they had the cat eyed boy and it was twenty five dollars.

791
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,109
Speaker 0: And I think ten or fifteen percent off.

792
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:04,938
Speaker 0: Maybe he's even twenty five percent off.

793
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:05,220
Speaker 1: Yep.

794
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:06,626
Speaker 0: So I'm like, hey, I should buy it.

795
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:07,389
Speaker 0: This guy says wait.

796
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,800
Speaker 0: And he pulls out his iPhone and it looks Amazon.

797
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,805
Speaker 0: It's cheaper on Amazon.

798
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:12,909
Speaker 0: And he tells me this.

799
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,800
Speaker 0: The guy running the booth says, how much cheaper?

800
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,711
Speaker 1: And we're like, I just said it's like.

801
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,720
Speaker 1: I just said like it's twenty three on Amazon.

802
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:21,864
Speaker 0: I was a little bit.

803
00:43:21,884 --> 00:43:23,330
Speaker 0: Then he's like, I'll give it to you for fifteen.

804
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:24,916
Speaker 1: I don't I remember it more like.

805
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:25,840
Speaker 1: I was just looking it up.

806
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,129
Speaker 1: And I just remember saying it's twenty three on Amazon.

807
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:30,660
Speaker 1: And the guy just popped out and was like, I'll sell zero.

808
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,443
Speaker 1: I never fifteen.

809
00:43:31,463 --> 00:43:34,959
Speaker 0: And he was standing there and he stands there for a minute and he like he says, give me it.

810
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:38,835
Speaker 0: And I hand it to him and he holds it and he flips it over and he looks at the back.

811
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:39,960
Speaker 0: He flips it over again.

812
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:42,432
Speaker 0: And then he hands it back and says, I'll give it to you for fifteen.

813
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,960
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that's right.

814
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,753
Speaker 0: I think his appraisal was no one else is going to buy this.

815
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:48,134
Speaker 1: Yeah.

816
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:49,740
Speaker 1: No one's going to buy cat eyed boy.

817
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,285
Speaker 0: Cat eyed boy is pretty badass, though.

818
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:52,570
Speaker 0: It's very key.

819
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,296
Speaker 0: Taro slash bug boy.

820
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:55,260
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to read that.

821
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,903
Speaker 1: That's my alley.

822
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,285
Speaker 0: It is.

823
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:57,672
Speaker 0: It is very much your alley.

824
00:43:57,913 --> 00:43:59,280
Speaker 0: I read the first half already.

825
00:43:59,340 --> 00:43:59,782
Speaker 0: It's really good.

826
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:00,464
Speaker 1: I'm taking it.

827
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:04,840
Speaker 0: But dealers room aside, the last thing I want to point out is that our friend Luke is a dealer.

828
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:05,903
Speaker 0: For Hammer Girl.

829
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:07,027
Speaker 0: And he goes to a lot of cons.

830
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,020
Speaker 0: He really should have been at this kind of the one kind we're at that he doesn't go to.

831
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:15,760
Speaker 0: He sells all the stuff that like no other dealer at this conference salad would have made bank.

832
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:22,580
Speaker 1: One more thing about the artist's alley is, I think, not the artist's alley, the dealer's room.

833
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:29,600
Speaker 1: I think Gundam models might be making a slight comeback because there were a lot more of them for sale there than there had been previous.

834
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:33,273
Speaker 1: You know, I saw like dealers there who I see at every single convention.

835
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,120
Speaker 1: you see, you know, but they stay.

836
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,560
Speaker 1: They obviously stocked up on models and I saw a lot more people buying them.

837
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,631
Speaker 1: I also think Princess Tutu is making a comeback.

838
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:43,534
Speaker 0: That was so weird.

839
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:45,100
Speaker 0: Like at first an anime you should see.

840
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:52,140
Speaker 0: We're like we have the whole section of anime you probably wouldn't watch unless someone told you to or tricked you into it, but are actually good.

841
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:54,346
Speaker 0: And the first example is Princess Tutu.

842
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:59,080
Speaker 0: There were like four independent groups of Princess Tutu cosplayers at this car.

843
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:05,180
Speaker 0: There were like two tables in the artist's alley with Princess Tutu art and there was Princess Tutu art in the art show.

844
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:13,979
Speaker 1: So people, I would be on the lookout for a slight resurgence in American anime fandom in Gundam models and also Princess Tutu.

845
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:19,520
Speaker 1: Don't expect there to be a boom, but a slight surge is what you can expect.

846
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:20,919
Speaker 0: Maybe a counter-attack.

847
00:45:23,782 --> 00:45:25,880
Speaker 0: Oh my god, so speak, we'll talk about this now.

848
00:45:26,382 --> 00:45:28,320
Speaker 1: I was just about to bring up the same thing.

849
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,372
Speaker 0: There was an artist alley and there was a dealer's room.

850
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:33,580
Speaker 0: There was also a swap meet.

851
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,966
Speaker 1: This is so awesome, right?

852
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:37,780
Speaker 1: Because you're not allowed to sell things unless you're a dealer, right?

853
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Speaker 1: Because you got to deal with taxes and all that crap, but there's no rule you can't swap things.

854
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,110
Speaker 1: So on Friday and on Saturday they do it twice.

855
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:46,580
Speaker 1: Anime Boston has a swap meet.

856
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,471
Speaker 1: Basically people come and they bring all this junk they don't want.

857
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:51,439
Speaker 1: Old mangas, old DVDs, old toys.

858
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,320
Speaker 0: Plastic Halloween masks of Gundam characters.

859
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:54,803
Speaker 0: Right.

860
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,011
Speaker 1: They lay them out on it.

861
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,300
Speaker 1: They have a room full of tables.

862
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:02,440
Speaker 1: They just set their stuff up on a table and you sit there and people walk around looking at your stuff.

863
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,820
Speaker 1: And they, you know, they offer to trade you and people trade all their anime stuff.

864
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:13,340
Speaker 1: And it's, I'm just not, I use selling a whole bunch of stuff on like Amazon, like comics and stuff, like one piece volumes they didn't want and such.

865
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:14,543
Speaker 1: Screw that.

866
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:17,660
Speaker 1: I'm saving all my stuff, all my comics now for Anime Boston.

867
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:27,700
Speaker 0: Thing is, I feel like what no one did, but I would do is I got, you got to dress up like the merchant from secret of Mata and not set up on the table, but put a rug down on the ground.

868
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:36,820
Speaker 1: I'm going to get a turban, a rug, a vase, a plastic snake, and the whole, you know, a purple vest, you know, with a white poofy shirt under it and the whole, the whole thing.

869
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,539
Speaker 0: And that's what I, and what about your idea of taking my trench coat and hanging everything on the inside?

870
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:44,640
Speaker 1: Two swap meets one Friday, one Saturday, I can do both on Friday.

871
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,580
Speaker 1: I'll lay out the rug and on Saturday I'll come with a trench coat.

872
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:47,922
Speaker 1: Right.

873
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:50,379
Speaker 1: And I'll walk around and be like, I got manga.

874
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,289
Speaker 0: People had some crazy stuff at this.

875
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:55,560
Speaker 1: Well, one dude had like really crazy stuff.

876
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,209
Speaker 1: It's like the Tetris board game.

877
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,134
Speaker 1: He had a Dr.

878
00:46:58,174 --> 00:46:58,999
Speaker 1: Chaos cartridge.

879
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:01,069
Speaker 1: It was, it was pretty out of control.

880
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:02,920
Speaker 0: One girl had two gold box.

881
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:03,902
Speaker 0: Yeah.

882
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:06,815
Speaker 1: Most people just had like, you know, old manga.

883
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:07,860
Speaker 1: They didn't want to read anymore.

884
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,140
Speaker 1: You know, like the same Tokyo pops you see going for a dollar in a dealer's room, but there was some good stuff to be had.

885
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,480
Speaker 1: You know, one guy was trying to like, you know, pawn off his cowboy bebop box, but everyone else had already seen it.

886
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,337
Speaker 1: So they didn't want it.

887
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:31,340
Speaker 0: So Friday night we went to something we've never really gone to in fullness before we went to and fully attended Daryl Surratt and Mike tool performing anime hell.

888
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:32,645
Speaker 1: Oh, the third guy was there.

889
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:33,207
Speaker 1: The Kaiju guy.

890
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:33,568
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

891
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:34,070
Speaker 0: The Kaiju guy.

892
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,572
Speaker 0: What was his name?

893
00:47:34,592 --> 00:47:35,436
Speaker 0: Cause he's all horn.

894
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:36,540
Speaker 0: Cause he's awesome.

895
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

896
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,286
Speaker 0: Anyway, anime hell.

897
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:41,231
Speaker 0: If you haven't been to it, you should go to at least once.

898
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:42,173
Speaker 1: I knew what it was.

899
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:42,935
Speaker 1: I knew of it.

900
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:44,740
Speaker 1: I understood it, but I had not attended it.

901
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,230
Speaker 0: It is one of those things where you really need to experience it to understand.

902
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,820
Speaker 0: And if you don't understand, check out my thing of the day from yesterday.

903
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:53,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

904
00:47:54,765 --> 00:48:02,940
Speaker 1: What I like about anime hell is it brings me back to that, you know, two in the morning, alone in the dark, Cartoon Network, Space Ghost kind of action.

905
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,042
Speaker 1: That's that's what it is.

906
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:06,967
Speaker 0: Plus this one was in 3D.

907
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,091
Speaker 1: And Ivan the Red was there.

908
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:10,713
Speaker 0: Ivan the Red was okay.

909
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:11,755
Speaker 1: I liked Ivan the Red.

910
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:14,500
Speaker 0: I don't know, 3D Bollywood and stories from North America.

911
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:15,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

912
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:15,682
Speaker 1: Those are good too.

913
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:19,710
Speaker 1: Also those little clips of the Jesus crap taken out of context.

914
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:22,956
Speaker 1: Come with me kid.

915
00:48:22,976 --> 00:48:23,517
Speaker 1: Okay.

916
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:28,063
Speaker 0: That was fun stuff.

917
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:28,524
Speaker 0: Yeah.

918
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:35,160
Speaker 0: And I was also happy that we basically stayed Friday night at anime Boston in the convention center until it closed.

919
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,352
Speaker 0: I have not stayed at a convention until it closed since like, it's been like three years.

920
00:48:40,412 --> 00:48:41,374
Speaker 0: I'm too old for that shit.

921
00:48:41,434 --> 00:48:43,620
Speaker 0: And somehow I did it at anime Boston.

922
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:44,862
Speaker 0: Twice.

923
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,707
Speaker 0: I was so pleased with myself.

924
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:47,369
Speaker 1: All right.

925
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:50,699
Speaker 1: I try to remember what all we did, the anime squares, which is OK.

926
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were going to.

927
00:48:52,384 --> 00:48:53,528
Speaker 0: we were guest squares.

928
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:55,916
Speaker 0: We were the bottom left square on anime square.

929
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:56,839
Speaker 1: Nobody picked us.

930
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,448
Speaker 0: Well, the bottom left square is like the bastard stepchild of square.

931
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:05,800
Speaker 1: The other problem is that, you know, they really they need to have nine microphones for the nine squares.

932
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,265
Speaker 1: That way we could talk at any time.

933
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:11,540
Speaker 1: And also, oh, the way they set up the squares is very interesting, though.

934
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,888
Speaker 0: It's like sit on the people sitting in chairs.

935
00:49:13,908 --> 00:49:15,674
Speaker 0: They would people like up on the stage.

936
00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:17,420
Speaker 0: There were people sitting on the table above them.

937
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:17,921
Speaker 1: Yeah.

938
00:49:17,941 --> 00:49:23,640
Speaker 1: So it's like there was a table on the stage for the top three squares, the stage for the middle three and the floor for the bottom three.

939
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:28,056
Speaker 0: You know what I would have done instead of having the computer screen, give everyone big X's nose to hold up.

940
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:29,060
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good idea.

941
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's good.

942
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:32,769
Speaker 1: Very good.

943
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,900
Speaker 1: Also, the guy reading the questions, he didn't read them very eloquently.

944
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

945
00:49:39,683 --> 00:49:40,044
Speaker 0: No, no.

946
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,831
Speaker 0: Elegant or eloquent.

947
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:42,934
Speaker 0: You could go either way.

948
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:44,520
Speaker 1: That's exactly my point.

949
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,732
Speaker 1: It was it was sometimes hard to get the question out of him.

950
00:49:47,094 --> 00:49:47,657
Speaker 0: It was OK.

951
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:48,200
Speaker 1: It was all right.

952
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,830
Speaker 1: It could it could have been a lot worse, but it was good.

953
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:51,520
Speaker 1: People were entertained by it greatly.

954
00:49:51,900 --> 00:50:02,800
Speaker 1: And in fact, you know, at that panel, I think that the you know, usually on a game show, it's the the hosts and such and the content of the game show has to carry, you know, the load.

955
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:09,540
Speaker 1: But in the anime squares, the contestants carried the load of all the entertainment, which is awesome.

956
00:50:09,781 --> 00:50:10,183
Speaker 0: Well, it was.

957
00:50:10,263 --> 00:50:12,818
Speaker 1: it was not often that you have such great contestants.

958
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:13,120
Speaker 0: Yes.

959
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,659
Speaker 0: I mean, usually we do like the anime match game and we'll have awesome guests and we'll be doing it.

960
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:20,740
Speaker 0: And the people we actually get from the audience have like never seen an anime in their lives.

961
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:21,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

962
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:21,944
Speaker 0: Like they did.

963
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:22,767
Speaker 0: They have no idea.

964
00:50:22,807 --> 00:50:26,720
Speaker 0: But random dude from the audience knew more than like anyone we've had on our shows.

965
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,672
Speaker 1: But he didn't have to know a lot for the anime squares.

966
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:31,540
Speaker 1: It wasn't an anime trivia kind of thing.

967
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,187
Speaker 0: But at the same time, those people were making some anime jokes.

968
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:38,880
Speaker 1: They were indeed making some anime jokes and they were dressed up as various shapes and sizes.

969
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:46,480
Speaker 1: But Saturday, we went to the California concert and first it was a video games orchestra concert.

970
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:46,921
Speaker 0: Yes.

971
00:50:47,563 --> 00:50:48,385
Speaker 0: They scheduled it wrong.

972
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:50,912
Speaker 0: They said California concert and they scheduled it.

973
00:50:51,313 --> 00:50:53,960
Speaker 0: The entirety of what they scheduled was the video game concert.

974
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:57,338
Speaker 0: And then after that, not on the schedule was the California concert.

975
00:50:57,439 --> 00:50:57,620
Speaker 1: Yeah.

976
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,318
Speaker 1: They basically the schedule said California concert 90 minutes.

977
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,063
Speaker 1: Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

978
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:07,680
Speaker 1: It was video games orchestra concert 90 minutes, followed by California concert very long.

979
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,273
Speaker 0: The video game orchestra concert was pretty damn bad ass.

980
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:11,714
Speaker 1: It was.

981
00:51:11,794 --> 00:51:13,260
Speaker 1: I mean, it was only, you know, a chamber.

982
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,965
Speaker 1: It wasn't, you know, a whole orchestra.

983
00:51:15,466 --> 00:51:18,796
Speaker 1: But, you know, that's not it doesn't mean much.

984
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:20,100
Speaker 1: It was fucking awesome.

985
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:25,600
Speaker 0: And Calafina, if you don't know, Calafina are three vocalists and Yuki Kajira.

986
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:33,058
Speaker 0: They did the music for such terrible shows as Dot Hack, Noir, the Cabolet.

987
00:51:33,078 --> 00:51:33,720
Speaker 0: What was that show?

988
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,139
Speaker 1: El Cazador de la Bruja.

989
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:38,582
Speaker 0: Yes.

990
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:44,580
Speaker 0: Basically amazing, amazing music that will trick you into watching a bad show far longer than you otherwise would.

991
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,612
Speaker 0: I watched 13 episodes.

992
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:46,240
Speaker 1: Black Butler.

993
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:52,338
Speaker 0: 13 episodes of Dot Hack before I realized it was bad because the music was so good.

994
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:52,880
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell.

995
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,303
Speaker 1: Exactly right.

996
00:51:54,343 --> 00:51:59,420
Speaker 1: So they do basically this amazing sort of operatic almost kind of singing.

997
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:00,968
Speaker 1: And they can really sing.

998
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:02,033
Speaker 1: I heard them sing in person.

999
00:52:02,073 --> 00:52:03,320
Speaker 1: So it wasn't digital effects.

1000
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,420
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there is a such thing as live digital manipulation.

1001
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,483
Speaker 1: Possibly.

1002
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:10,092
Speaker 1: But for three people at once, it's not easy.

1003
00:52:10,232 --> 00:52:12,280
Speaker 0: They can freaking sing.

1004
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:12,781
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1005
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:14,907
Speaker 1: And the video games orchestra can fucking play.

1006
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:19,560
Speaker 1: But we because the concert was scheduled as such, we could not stay for the whole thing.

1007
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:25,120
Speaker 1: We had to leave before the very final bit because we had to go and get ready for our panel.

1008
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:26,804
Speaker 1: So that was kind of sad.

1009
00:52:26,824 --> 00:52:32,200
Speaker 0: We saw the whole concert except the encore bit, which apparently is when Yuki herself came out and performed with them.

1010
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:32,823
Speaker 0: I could have cried.

1011
00:52:32,843 --> 00:52:36,140
Speaker 1: And someone said that she was all elegant, like wicked, elegant.

1012
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,467
Speaker 0: I think it was like she went on.

1013
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:43,240
Speaker 0: She went at length to describe the degree to which this woman is elegant.

1014
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:44,042
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1015
00:52:44,182 --> 00:52:46,269
Speaker 0: So I sort of grace.

1016
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,052
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1017
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:49,640
Speaker 1: And of course, during the video games orchestra.

1018
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:49,982
Speaker 1: Right.

1019
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:54,019
Speaker 1: They were totally willing to let you photograph and whatever, which means everyone could bring their camera in.

1020
00:52:54,421 --> 00:53:00,220
Speaker 1: But during the California, you couldn't photograph or whatever, even though everyone had the cameras on them.

1021
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,639
Speaker 0: Still, you know, Japanese guests, that's the way it is.

1022
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:02,860
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1023
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:07,639
Speaker 1: One other thing is that while everyone was standing there waiting for the video games orchestra concert.

1024
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:16,720
Speaker 1: to begin, they had a pre-show in which they had video content on the screen that had audio that had audience participation thingies.

1025
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,444
Speaker 0: Stage.

1026
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,900
Speaker 0: All I have to say about that is that one brilliant.

1027
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,207
Speaker 1: It was indeed brilliant and effective.

1028
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:24,693
Speaker 1: It worked very well.

1029
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,580
Speaker 1: It was the ultimate crowd control.

1030
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,800
Speaker 0: It was exactly the same.

1031
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,136
Speaker 1: The only thing I question is, are they going to keep?

1032
00:53:31,618 --> 00:53:32,000
Speaker 1: are they going?

1033
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,990
Speaker 1: They can't reuse the same one next year.

1034
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,840
Speaker 1: They have to make a new one just like it.

1035
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:39,640
Speaker 0: They should sell the ones they use to other convention.

1036
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:45,240
Speaker 1: They should make a company that makes those for any convention, any events, any event.

1037
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:53,260
Speaker 0: We will make these things for stadiums, because at most anime conventions or like, you know, art animal club stuff back in the day, we would have to do this manually.

1038
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:59,979
Speaker 0: Like when the crowd was waiting for a music night to start or a tournament to start or something, like someone like me would have to get up.

1039
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:05,280
Speaker 0: And we had this list of like these BS games we would play with the audience just to keep them occupied.

1040
00:54:05,962 --> 00:54:08,580
Speaker 1: Like the one of our panels, I think an anime you should see.

1041
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:09,442
Speaker 1: I made the.

1042
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:14,300
Speaker 1: I did the wave with the whole panel room because there were like seven hundred and fifty people in that room.

1043
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,955
Speaker 1: I did the way from the front to the back.

1044
00:54:15,995 --> 00:54:16,460
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

1045
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:16,901
Speaker 0: Yes.

1046
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:27,000
Speaker 0: Anime, you should say the last thing about the king of the wave, the space that the concert is in for Anime Boston in the Heinz Convention Center is very Pax-esque.

1047
00:54:28,162 --> 00:54:30,356
Speaker 0: It lacks only the lack of chairs.

1048
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:30,959
Speaker 1: Yes.

1049
00:54:33,262 --> 00:54:35,996
Speaker 1: And I'd even had like an upper deck, too, on both sides.

1050
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:36,418
Speaker 1: That was on.

1051
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:36,619
Speaker 1: Yes.

1052
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:41,020
Speaker 0: And I point out that Pax East Coast there, I think is going to work really better.

1053
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:41,925
Speaker 1: Use that upper deck.

1054
00:54:42,005 --> 00:54:44,500
Speaker 1: I want to go up God because that I think about it right.

1055
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:47,218
Speaker 1: I've been to the concerts at Pax last year.

1056
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:47,460
Speaker 1: Right.

1057
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,560
Speaker 1: So they're probably going to be very similar on the East Coast.

1058
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,537
Speaker 0: But then again, East Coast, they're probably going to get some East Coast acts.

1059
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,203
Speaker 1: Possibly.

1060
00:54:55,363 --> 00:54:59,480
Speaker 1: But anyway, you know, standing there was great and all being right with the concert.

1061
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:05,580
Speaker 1: But it's like I feel like to do it again, I would want to sit back and that upper deck would be so great.

1062
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:09,087
Speaker 0: You are old.

1063
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,660
Speaker 1: Maybe we're older than all the other people there.

1064
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,401
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

1065
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:20,920
Speaker 0: Though I feel the average age of anime Boston was not high, but it was higher than other anime.

1066
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:21,381
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1067
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,144
Speaker 1: But I think that's only.

1068
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:25,420
Speaker 1: I think I don't think that's a result of it being actual higher.

1069
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,215
Speaker 1: I think it's a result of the con goers aging.

1070
00:55:28,235 --> 00:55:29,100
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1071
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,066
Speaker 1: It's the same people got a year older.

1072
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:35,080
Speaker 1: I don't think it's actually, you know, that older people are, you know, coming.

1073
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:40,000
Speaker 0: No, but that that that means there's a significant trend because before it was this boom of kids a certain age.

1074
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:43,040
Speaker 0: So we had this constant influx every year of younger and younger people.

1075
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:50,260
Speaker 0: If those whatever percentage of those people continue to go to cons as they get older are the ones who start watching more anime.

1076
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:50,841
Speaker 1: That's true.

1077
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:53,770
Speaker 0: And we'll have to do a separate show on that.

1078
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,820
Speaker 0: But anyway, the concert was great.

1079
00:55:57,221 --> 00:56:01,840
Speaker 0: But speaking of Scott doing the wave, our anime, you should see panel was.

1080
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:06,040
Speaker 0: This is the reason why I think we need to do this at every convention forever now.

1081
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,820
Speaker 0: Or in the very least, after we do it for a few years, like pass the baton to someone else.

1082
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,048
Speaker 1: It needs to be some time passing or at least swap it up.

1083
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:17,900
Speaker 0: Like maybe we'll always do it, but we'll always get a special guest on.

1084
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:20,667
Speaker 0: Maybe it's Daryl Surratt added a lot to it.

1085
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:24,660
Speaker 0: I kind of want to do it with Gerald instead at Otacon just to have a different person.

1086
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,230
Speaker 1: You know, he's going to tell him to watch bad shows.

1087
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,699
Speaker 0: He'll tell him to watch, right, man?

1088
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,333
Speaker 1: No, he'll tell him to watch, like, I don't know, desert punk.

1089
00:56:32,996 --> 00:56:33,698
Speaker 0: Nodgica.

1090
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:34,240
Speaker 1: Nodgica.

1091
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:43,340
Speaker 0: But anime, you should see, like it was crazy how many people were there, especially because that room is bigger than most other cons panel rooms.

1092
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:45,329
Speaker 0: And the fact that people were still turned away.

1093
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,972
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1094
00:56:45,992 --> 00:56:47,720
Speaker 0: I don't know what else I can say.

1095
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,206
Speaker 0: Other than that, the crowd really liked it.

1096
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:51,374
Speaker 0: And we will upload these slides.

1097
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:52,660
Speaker 0: Everyone's asking for them.

1098
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:57,020
Speaker 0: I think at Otacon, we're just going to have to print out a one page thing and give it to everyone.

1099
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:57,560
Speaker 0: Yep.

1100
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,945
Speaker 1: Let's see, what other panels did we go to?

1101
00:56:59,985 --> 00:57:06,338
Speaker 1: We went to, we sat there for Alex Leavitt's panel about Shinichiro Watanabe.

1102
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:07,100
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

1103
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,661
Speaker 0: It was.

1104
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:12,680
Speaker 0: We also went to, well, we'll save the Vile Specter of Moai for last because something special happened there.

1105
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:13,920
Speaker 1: Of course, something very special happened there.

1106
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,640
Speaker 0: We'll tell that after we talk about the late show.

1107
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,373
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to the worst of Tezuka panel.

1108
00:57:20,424 --> 00:57:20,685
Speaker 0: Yep.

1109
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:23,060
Speaker 1: And that was that was pretty great.

1110
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,133
Speaker 0: I've seen some of what they showed, but I had not seen all.

1111
00:57:26,294 --> 00:57:27,600
Speaker 1: I had not seen that Cleopatra.

1112
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,250
Speaker 1: Oh, my, I, I, I, I theoretically live action Astro Boy.

1113
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,680
Speaker 0: I theoretically knew how bad that Cleopatra was.

1114
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:41,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm in the same boat, but seeing it, actually seeing it was like, and actually that Phoenix movie.

1115
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,464
Speaker 1: I kind of want to watch.

1116
00:57:42,524 --> 00:57:45,219
Speaker 0: I kind of want to Otacon's got to get a hold of that and show it.

1117
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:46,084
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

1118
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:47,030
Speaker 0: Like video five.

1119
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:47,794
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1120
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:48,519
Speaker 1: I'm all over that.

1121
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:59,119
Speaker 0: But we you know, we did our panels and anime you should see was like crazy, despite the fact that ninety nine percent of the audience never even heard of Escaflowne.

1122
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:03,100
Speaker 0: Or like more than half the audience never seen Ghost in the Shell.

1123
00:58:04,162 --> 00:58:05,238
Speaker 0: Hardly anyone had seen Ava.

1124
00:58:07,642 --> 00:58:14,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had to resist asking for every single anime how many people had seen it because then it would get really stupid because maybe we should make a panel.

1125
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:15,849
Speaker 1: How many have you seen it?

1126
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:16,835
Speaker 1: And it would just be here.

1127
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:17,418
Speaker 1: Who's seen it?

1128
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:20,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that the whole panel.

1129
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:24,280
Speaker 0: how we could turn that into a pseudo game show where you you narrow the crowd down.

1130
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,004
Speaker 0: You know, have you seen it?

1131
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,440
Speaker 0: Have you seen it until there's only a few people left.

1132
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:31,880
Speaker 0: But then if they say yes, you randomly grill them to make sure they're not lying.

1133
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,120
Speaker 1: Of course, when you get down to the low numbers right when you got like one or two dudes left, you bring them up and you grill them on every single one of the shows to make sure.

1134
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:42,108
Speaker 0: So you say you've seen Evangelion.

1135
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:44,637
Speaker 0: name any character from it.

1136
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:48,896
Speaker 1: Misati.

1137
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:51,778
Speaker 1: Fail.

1138
00:58:53,642 --> 00:58:54,500
Speaker 1: Know your creators.

1139
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:55,940
Speaker 0: Tanaka fail.

1140
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,139
Speaker 0: We run it differently every time.

1141
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,819
Speaker 0: And I think we finally figured out how to run it.

1142
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:06,220
Speaker 0: So if you've seen our panels at other conventions, particularly anime, you should see don't go to our panels.

1143
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,440
Speaker 0: But go to know your creators, because it'll be very, very different.

1144
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,313
Speaker 0: We only got like 200 people.

1145
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,439
Speaker 0: I know your creators, but more people were shuffling in toward the end.

1146
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was sort of weird the way the panels are scheduled.

1147
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,109
Speaker 1: They weren't scheduled evenly.

1148
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,460
Speaker 1: Some were big, some were small.

1149
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:24,840
Speaker 1: Some had space, but for some had empty space before or after them.

1150
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:25,122
Speaker 1: Right.

1151
00:59:25,546 --> 00:59:27,140
Speaker 1: So it wasn't really consistent.

1152
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,800
Speaker 1: Like sometimes you'd start up a panel and an empty room and you'd have to fill it up with the power of your panel.

1153
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:37,520
Speaker 1: But sometimes you'd get someone's leavings from the previous panel and you'd be able to hold onto them and drag in some more.

1154
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,080
Speaker 1: Sometimes you would leave some people left over after a panel, but sometimes your panel be over to clear out.

1155
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:48,120
Speaker 1: And it was, you know, it sort of mixed it up and it was interesting, but I think consistency is better.

1156
00:59:48,841 --> 00:59:53,660
Speaker 0: So in all honesty, we did Saturday night, the late show, late night anime Boston.

1157
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,770
Speaker 0: This was kind of a test.

1158
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,920
Speaker 0: We were seeing how this would work.

1159
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, we learned a lot from trying this at Katsu.

1160
00:59:58,203 --> 00:59:59,740
Speaker 0: I think we did a really good job, actually.

1161
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:01,778
Speaker 0: All things considered at Katsu Con.

1162
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:01,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1163
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:02,960
Speaker 0: At Anime Boston.

1164
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,544
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

1165
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:09,300
Speaker 1: Basically we, you know, we didn't, we weren't able to do like a professional actual late show format or anything.

1166
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,765
Speaker 0: Because we didn't bring like any of the crew.

1167
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:14,840
Speaker 0: It was basically just me and Scott doing this entirely with force of will.

1168
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:15,380
Speaker 1: Right.

1169
01:00:15,702 --> 01:00:17,066
Speaker 1: And the room was not that crowded.

1170
01:00:17,086 --> 01:00:20,959
Speaker 1: It was across from the rave, but the doors were closed and the rave did not interfere with us.

1171
01:00:21,461 --> 01:00:23,488
Speaker 1: And we only had competition.

1172
01:00:23,669 --> 01:00:26,660
Speaker 1: The only competition we had was porn and sleeping and rave.

1173
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:31,200
Speaker 0: So, you know, there were, there were between 50 and 70 people in the room when it started.

1174
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:31,673
Speaker 1: That was about right.

1175
01:00:31,714 --> 01:00:31,878
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1176
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:35,992
Speaker 0: And the cool thing was it wasn't even in the con book.

1177
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:38,500
Speaker 0: So people showed up and no one knew what it was.

1178
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,200
Speaker 1: It was like in the, in the schedule, I said late show, but in the con book, it didn't say anything about it.

1179
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,045
Speaker 1: So it was just like late show.

1180
01:00:44,086 --> 01:00:44,549
Speaker 1: What's that?

1181
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:46,300
Speaker 1: And everyone asked us, what's the late show?

1182
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,540
Speaker 1: And I was like, you know, it's technically a late show, like, you know, Letterman or whatever, but anime, but you know what?

1183
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:53,805
Speaker 1: We're just going to sit up there and BS.

1184
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:59,819
Speaker 1: And we just, we tell, we told the joke of the only other things scheduled right now are porn about 10 times.

1185
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,325
Speaker 1: And then we dropped it.

1186
01:01:01,406 --> 01:01:01,527
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1187
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:02,900
Speaker 0: Then we dropped it, moved on to other jokes.

1188
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:11,000
Speaker 0: But if any, if there's any gauge, I forget what, what joke someone told, but there was a point at which someone said something and the audience just freaking lost it.

1189
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:13,567
Speaker 0: Like more so than any other joke.

1190
01:01:13,848 --> 01:01:17,240
Speaker 0: It looks like everyone there had a good time between me.

1191
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:31,260
Speaker 1: You know, it was just me, you, Daryl and, uh, it was just us sort of shooting the shit, you know, at the audience, having a nice discussion, saying funny stuff, showing, uh, we, we did the, um, the Harris bit.

1192
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:31,983
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1193
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,330
Speaker 1: We ended with the hope.

1194
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,174
Speaker 1: Don't know Ken.

1195
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:34,858
Speaker 1: Oh no bit.

1196
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:35,240
Speaker 0: Oh my.

1197
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,039
Speaker 0: The thing is because Daryl, like he, he's seen that clip as many times as we have seen that clip.

1198
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:40,320
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1199
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:48,360
Speaker 0: I've seen that clip a lot of times, but when we finally showed at the end, it's basically me, Daryl, Lou and Scott looking at my laptop, watching.

1200
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:49,423
Speaker 1: I was looking at the big screen.

1201
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:53,135
Speaker 0: We're looking at the laptop and we're just giggling because we all know how it goes.

1202
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:54,740
Speaker 0: And like we couldn't control it.

1203
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,009
Speaker 0: So Daryl's just sitting there like, it's a hilarious clip.

1204
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:03,960
Speaker 0: How can you, we also did the bit of the openers and closers to anime in Germany.

1205
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:04,963
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

1206
01:02:04,983 --> 01:02:06,908
Speaker 1: I think that went over actually really well.

1207
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:08,774
Speaker 1: People, people like that Italian one piece.

1208
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:11,060
Speaker 0: Italian one piece is better than real one piece.

1209
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,502
Speaker 1: Italian one piece is better.

1210
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:20,220
Speaker 1: And we also had fun torturing the audience with English one piece, which is just as good for, as the enjoying of the Italian one piece.

1211
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,404
Speaker 0: I think it was really fun.

1212
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:25,840
Speaker 0: And if Anime Boston will let us do it, uh, we were, we were, we were going to do this.

1213
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,167
Speaker 1: I want to do a panel of just the foreign opener.

1214
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:29,310
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm already working on that.

1215
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:32,300
Speaker 1: We should throw in like, you know, the DuckTales and stuff.

1216
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,597
Speaker 0: Anime Boston gave me like more ideas for panels than the last year of trying to come up with panels.

1217
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:38,420
Speaker 0: gave me for panels.

1218
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:38,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

1219
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:39,042
Speaker 1: Right.

1220
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:42,600
Speaker 1: Basically took bits from other panels and expand them into panels themselves.

1221
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,061
Speaker 1: Yep.

1222
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:44,885
Speaker 0: But the Late Show went really well.

1223
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:52,040
Speaker 0: And we originally were going to do this at KatsuCon, but we're kind of dropping KatsuCon for now, at least until they get their act together more.

1224
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:57,380
Speaker 0: But if Anime Boston will have us, I think we're going to up the ante and do the full on Late Show.

1225
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:57,741
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1226
01:02:57,761 --> 01:03:00,111
Speaker 1: We're going to need to do something to get more people in there though.

1227
01:03:00,231 --> 01:03:02,440
Speaker 1: And we're also going to need some more help on the backend.

1228
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:02,940
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1229
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,051
Speaker 0: Basically if we're going to do the Late Show, we're going to need to bring like our staff.

1230
01:03:06,071 --> 01:03:08,440
Speaker 0: We're going to need to bring like four or five crew people.

1231
01:03:08,862 --> 01:03:11,480
Speaker 0: And we're going to need to get at least one or two voice actor guests.

1232
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1233
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:15,365
Speaker 1: I think, I really think we should stick to the one voice actor guest.

1234
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:25,320
Speaker 1: That way we can fill half the Late Show with like our content and such, and then we can fill the other half with the interviewing a guest bit and then end with some, our content.

1235
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:35,840
Speaker 0: Plus, you know, like real Late Shows, you have the kind of two bit guests, you know, the Daryl Surratt, the Lou, not really two bit, but two bit in the sense of, you know, if you've got Vic and you've got Daryl, the audience wants to see Vic.

1236
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:38,725
Speaker 1: All right.

1237
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:49,660
Speaker 0: But the Late Show, I think like it was super fun to do and we had a great time, but then afterward we stayed because there was a panel that Daryl Surratt was going to be on with someone else.

1238
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:51,223
Speaker 1: The someone else.

1239
01:03:51,383 --> 01:03:57,820
Speaker 0: Well, the panel was the Vile Specter of Moet and it was, and I wanted to know about the Vile Specter of Moet.

1240
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,415
Speaker 0: And I knew a lot of this, like Emily had taught me a lot of this and like we knew a lot of the basics.

1241
01:04:02,656 --> 01:04:03,840
Speaker 1: I still learn things I didn't know.

1242
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,192
Speaker 0: This panel was so well researched and so together and it was, it was amazing.

1243
01:04:08,272 --> 01:04:10,840
Speaker 0: I look at Otaku in an entirely different light.

1244
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:18,460
Speaker 1: And you know, it's like, I always forget like, you know, the bad Miyazaki, you know, it's like, I know of him, like, you know, they posted his picture and I'm like, Oh yeah, that guy.

1245
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,340
Speaker 1: But I always forget like how significant that dude was in Otaku history.

1246
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:24,584
Speaker 1: You know, it's like.

1247
01:04:24,644 --> 01:04:28,940
Speaker 1: I needed that reminder, you know, and it really, you know, changes the whole perspective.

1248
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:32,320
Speaker 0: Plus, I didn't know about the early post-war usage of Otaku.

1249
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew that it meant house, right?

1250
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:38,620
Speaker 0: But I didn't know the other, like why the panel was really interesting.

1251
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:44,815
Speaker 0: And we're going to make sure any con where we have influence, he is going to come and do that panel again.

1252
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:46,660
Speaker 0: because the person doing the panel.

1253
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,950
Speaker 0: I walk up and I'm like, Hey, this looks like a good panel.

1254
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,739
Speaker 0: I shake the guy's hand and he's like, do you know who I am?

1255
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,110
Speaker 1: Well, he's like, you guys stole my club and we're like, what the fuck?

1256
01:04:56,632 --> 01:04:58,840
Speaker 1: And his, his badge says Christian daily.

1257
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,169
Speaker 1: So I'm like, I don't know anyone named Christian daily.

1258
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,479
Speaker 1: And it's like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1259
01:05:04,722 --> 01:05:10,080
Speaker 0: And I said, we suddenly realized that this dude was one of the original RIT anime club presidents.

1260
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:10,743
Speaker 1: That's right.

1261
01:05:10,784 --> 01:05:12,820
Speaker 0: This guy, there's a continuous.

1262
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:24,740
Speaker 1: See, when you are an anime club, see if you're probably the anime club president, like if you're in the anime club at RIT now, you probably hear these names like rim Scott Johnson, Luke, Christian, the other Scott.

1263
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,602
Speaker 1: It wasn't, there was another.

1264
01:05:25,642 --> 01:05:26,886
Speaker 1: Scott is president, right?

1265
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:27,066
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1266
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:29,694
Speaker 1: Scott Meeker and Jason what's his name?

1267
01:05:29,974 --> 01:05:32,020
Speaker 1: or Saudi and Greg young.

1268
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:40,380
Speaker 0: And especially, you know, there are some anime clubs that aren't that big, but there are like old school anime clubs where like being the president of that club in that school is a big deal.

1269
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:47,400
Speaker 0: Like it's, it's, it's like on the level of it's like if Utena were real to a tiny, tiny degree.

1270
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,440
Speaker 1: So you just, when we were in the anime club during the course of those years, we heard these names, Christian, something, something Scott Meeker, something, right.

1271
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,783
Speaker 1: We just heard these names.

1272
01:05:55,823 --> 01:05:56,966
Speaker 1: We didn't really know these people.

1273
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,916
Speaker 1: And occasionally like at a convention like Scott Johnson would say, Hey, that's Scott Meeker.

1274
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:02,240
Speaker 1: What's up for like five minutes.

1275
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:02,541
Speaker 0: Yup.

1276
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:10,537
Speaker 0: At Otacon, I think it was two years ago, we had five years of anime club presidents at the same time at the same time.

1277
01:06:10,557 --> 01:06:11,218
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

1278
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:11,960
Speaker 0: That was crazy.

1279
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:25,560
Speaker 1: So when we saw the badge was Christian and he said club, we're like, Oh shit, this dude was like anime club president, like before you're even at RIT, like we're getting the point now to where like he was graduated when we got there.

1280
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,081
Speaker 0: Yup.

1281
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:34,977
Speaker 0: And he, it's interesting because like our era at the anime club, like from Luke, Scott Johnson, me, Lisa, like this, there's this progression where there were huge changes.

1282
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:36,620
Speaker 0: Like everything exploded in good ways.

1283
01:06:37,262 --> 01:06:39,799
Speaker 0: And Christian was president during a similar explosion.

1284
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:40,701
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1285
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:42,446
Speaker 1: The perhaps the original explosion.

1286
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:47,880
Speaker 1: He was talking about how when he was in the club, like technically this girl was president who didn't do anything.

1287
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,084
Speaker 0: It's funny how the exact same thing happened with Scott Johnson later.

1288
01:06:53,006 --> 01:06:53,547
Speaker 0: Good times.

1289
01:06:53,627 --> 01:07:04,180
Speaker 0: But as a result, we, we, we met like one of the classic people of our own personal history and at the same time saw an awesome panel.

1290
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:08,010
Speaker 0: So Christian Daley, you are going to be at every freaking con we can get you into.

1291
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:08,632
Speaker 0: Good God.

1292
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:11,680
Speaker 1: Any con he wants to go to that he can go to.

1293
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:13,144
Speaker 1: All right.

1294
01:07:13,224 --> 01:07:15,960
Speaker 1: So, uh, what else is there to say about the anime of Austin?

1295
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,542
Speaker 0: Sunday was Sunday.

1296
01:07:17,562 --> 01:07:18,564
Speaker 0: We didn't do a lot of the con.

1297
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:19,527
Speaker 0: We kind of just hung out.

1298
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:19,647
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1299
01:07:19,707 --> 01:07:22,555
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, the schedule was not jam packed on Sunday.

1300
01:07:22,595 --> 01:07:24,500
Speaker 1: We could have gone to the open and closing ceremonies.

1301
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:30,660
Speaker 0: We, uh, we kind of skipped out on like Saturday evening at the con to go get dinner with friends outside the con.

1302
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,001
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1303
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:34,587
Speaker 1: It's not to be covered by this episode to be covered another time up.

1304
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:38,054
Speaker 0: the area around the convention center is actually great for a convention.

1305
01:07:38,094 --> 01:07:41,500
Speaker 0: You walk one block in any direction and it's very nice restaurant.

1306
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,722
Speaker 0: There are a million nice restaurants and no con people.

1307
01:07:43,983 --> 01:07:44,223
Speaker 0: Yep.

1308
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:44,683
Speaker 0: Zero.

1309
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:48,568
Speaker 0: Also, there's a salad place because the cool thing is anime.

1310
01:07:48,588 --> 01:07:50,390
Speaker 0: Boston could not fit in the Heinz.

1311
01:07:50,490 --> 01:08:00,060
Speaker 1: Like if it were just the Heinz, it's actually that the Heinz is a convention center is attached to a mall, a yuppie mall, which is attached to this hotel and is also attached to the Prudential tower.

1312
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:08,700
Speaker 1: It's like all these things are physically joined at the hip and that's necessary because all those con goers are going to that mall to get that caught food court.

1313
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,463
Speaker 0: You walk into that mall, like entering the mall.

1314
01:08:11,563 --> 01:08:16,729
Speaker 0: The mall is as crowded with nothing but con people as like a hallway in Otakon is.

1315
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:17,090
Speaker 0: Yep.

1316
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:25,460
Speaker 1: That hotel attachment allows them to have the later night programming that a convention could not, a convention con alone could not have.

1317
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,041
Speaker 0: Case in point.

1318
01:08:26,321 --> 01:08:31,046
Speaker 0: Anime Boston had two video gaming rooms, one in the convention center, one in the hotel.

1319
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:35,932
Speaker 0: They also had tabletop gaming run by this awesome dude in the hotel table.

1320
01:08:35,971 --> 01:08:36,853
Speaker 0: So I could go late.

1321
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:37,193
Speaker 0: Yes.

1322
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:40,117
Speaker 0: Tabletop gaming at Kinetic Kinetic Con.

1323
01:08:40,197 --> 01:08:42,899
Speaker 0: Anime Boston was like a mini Kinetic Con.

1324
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was not as good as Kinetic Con, but it was actually going like it was a room about the size of the UberCon room.

1325
01:08:49,932 --> 01:08:50,192
Speaker 1: Right.

1326
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,376
Speaker 1: And they had games there.

1327
01:08:52,416 --> 01:08:54,580
Speaker 1: Most of it was people playing Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc.

1328
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,386
Speaker 1: A lot of people were playing this monster Godzilla Kaiju miniatures game.

1329
01:08:59,407 --> 01:09:01,109
Speaker 0: There were a ton of German board games.

1330
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:05,136
Speaker 1: And they had a table that pretty much just had like one of every good German board game on it.

1331
01:09:05,176 --> 01:09:07,680
Speaker 1: And you could just pick them up and play without checking them out or anything.

1332
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:09,983
Speaker 0: And no one stole anything like the back right of the room.

1333
01:09:10,002 --> 01:09:12,867
Speaker 0: There were two tables running like D&D and role playing games all weekend.

1334
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:19,154
Speaker 1: Shadowrun and Vezum and the titles of these games were those around one half role playing game.

1335
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:23,200
Speaker 0: It was obvious that these were the fun convention style D&D role playing.

1336
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,185
Speaker 1: So I mean, usually right, like at Katsucon, you know, there's this.

1337
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:31,634
Speaker 1: I guess there's nominally a tabletop gaming or like Otacon, but nobody.

1338
01:09:31,674 --> 01:09:32,716
Speaker 0: hard gaming area.

1339
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:32,956
Speaker 1: Right.

1340
01:09:32,975 --> 01:09:35,020
Speaker 1: But no one uses it except for the LARP.

1341
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:35,240
Speaker 1: Right.

1342
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,243
Speaker 1: And they had there was a LARP area at the in that room.

1343
01:09:38,283 --> 01:09:38,604
Speaker 1: But I don't.

1344
01:09:38,764 --> 01:09:40,446
Speaker 1: I didn't really see too much action in the LARP.

1345
01:09:41,147 --> 01:09:42,408
Speaker 1: It might it might have moved around.

1346
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:42,929
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1347
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:52,760
Speaker 1: But there was actually significant action in the tabletop CCG board game role playing game department, you know, enough that we spent some time in there and played some games and had some fun.

1348
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:53,120
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1349
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:54,403
Speaker 0: We talked to people how to play games.

1350
01:09:54,443 --> 01:09:55,705
Speaker 0: We played a bunch of games.

1351
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,950
Speaker 0: We learned we found about a game that was fun, but not worth buying.

1352
01:09:59,231 --> 01:09:59,371
Speaker 1: Yep.

1353
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:00,513
Speaker 0: Might be worth buying.

1354
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:02,015
Speaker 1: I wouldn't buy that game.

1355
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:02,997
Speaker 0: I might buy it for cheap.

1356
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,840
Speaker 0: It's a good game to play it like cons with other people.

1357
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,921
Speaker 1: It's a game for you to buy.

1358
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:07,363
Speaker 1: Not for me to buy.

1359
01:10:07,423 --> 01:10:08,865
Speaker 0: I'll put it next to Twilight Struggle.

1360
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:09,466
Speaker 1: Right.

1361
01:10:09,546 --> 01:10:13,852
Speaker 0: And Hellas.

1362
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,276
Speaker 0: They had a DDR machine and an in the groove machine.

1363
01:10:17,637 --> 01:10:19,920
Speaker 1: They also had some pads hooked up to a PlayStation.

1364
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:20,621
Speaker 0: Yep.

1365
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:25,045
Speaker 0: The rave was not the kind of music I want to dance to.

1366
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:26,046
Speaker 0: Nothing is ever beaten.

1367
01:10:26,066 --> 01:10:27,187
Speaker 0: The first katsukan.

1368
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:27,688
Speaker 0: I went to that.

1369
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:30,431
Speaker 0: That was like the best anime dance I've ever seen.

1370
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:39,520
Speaker 0: But they are twice as good in the music department as Otacon because Otacon is just boom, boom, boom, boom for like three or four hours.

1371
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:44,465
Speaker 1: I went into the rave room as they were picking up all of the dance floor tiles and all that stuff.

1372
01:10:45,145 --> 01:10:47,147
Speaker 1: And it was looking like a pretty well laid out room.

1373
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:47,508
Speaker 0: Yep.

1374
01:10:47,568 --> 01:10:49,770
Speaker 0: And they had two different areas with two different kinds of music.

1375
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:52,833
Speaker 0: And the music was not like great dance music.

1376
01:10:53,133 --> 01:10:57,357
Speaker 0: But it had like four more elements other than just boom, boom, boom.

1377
01:10:57,637 --> 01:10:57,797
Speaker 0: Yep.

1378
01:10:58,218 --> 01:10:59,499
Speaker 0: It was almost danceable.

1379
01:10:59,599 --> 01:11:00,540
Speaker 0: I was very pleased with it.

1380
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:01,961
Speaker 1: So let's see.

1381
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:04,383
Speaker 1: I feel like there's something we're missing here.

1382
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:05,885
Speaker 0: Something we're missing.

1383
01:11:05,905 --> 01:11:08,908
Speaker 0: We hung out with Daryl Surratt a lot.

1384
01:11:09,328 --> 01:11:12,171
Speaker 1: The panels we did, the panels we went to.

1385
01:11:12,412 --> 01:11:15,775
Speaker 0: We have a lot of shout outs for cool people we met or hung out with at the con in general.

1386
01:11:16,516 --> 01:11:17,357
Speaker 0: I mean, Vega was there.

1387
01:11:17,377 --> 01:11:18,538
Speaker 0: We hung out with her a whole bunch.

1388
01:11:19,699 --> 01:11:19,979
Speaker 0: Water's Poison.

1389
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,121
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

1390
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:22,401
Speaker 1: Right.

1391
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:23,823
Speaker 1: Water's Poison's girlfriend.

1392
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:26,466
Speaker 1: She went to this plushie making panel.

1393
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:27,067
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1394
01:11:27,087 --> 01:11:27,988
Speaker 0: I wanted to go to that.

1395
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:33,794
Speaker 1: And she came out and like she was she like had a half made plushie of, you know, major Kusanagi.

1396
01:11:33,834 --> 01:11:35,096
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, that was not big enough.

1397
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:38,560
Speaker 0: But I don't think they had enough stuffing in that room to make the bubble.

1398
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,804
Speaker 0: But it depends, though, is it manga version?

1399
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:44,266
Speaker 0: Is it later?

1400
01:11:44,486 --> 01:11:49,150
Speaker 1: No, but it's like she had this little dolly and she had like, you know, a little purple hair, a little black coat.

1401
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,051
Speaker 1: And it's like she was going to.

1402
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:52,574
Speaker 1: you know, it was looking like, hey, that could be pretty good when it's ready.

1403
01:11:52,614 --> 01:11:58,460
Speaker 1: So that was, you know, I didn't go to the panel, but it looked good enough by the judging by the results to me.

1404
01:11:59,300 --> 01:11:59,861
Speaker 0: Who else was there?

1405
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:00,681
Speaker 0: was Naito was there.

1406
01:12:00,701 --> 01:12:03,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just lots of people.

1407
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:05,725
Speaker 0: We ran into a ton of you farmers and front row crew people.

1408
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:07,846
Speaker 0: So let us know if you were here.

1409
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:11,528
Speaker 0: And we forgot to mention you because we I got like a pile of business cards.

1410
01:12:11,589 --> 01:12:13,470
Speaker 1: Ian Levenstein and his girlfriend were there.

1411
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:18,093
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize that his girlfriend works with a Pokemon company until just now.

1412
01:12:18,653 --> 01:12:19,154
Speaker 1: So I'm going to.

1413
01:12:19,194 --> 01:12:21,035
Speaker 1: I'm going to get some hookups in that department.

1414
01:12:21,055 --> 01:12:21,675
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

1415
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:28,820
Speaker 0: The coolest thing, though, before anime, you should see, you know, we're like we're kind of standing outside the room getting ready to go in and this big group of kids walk up to it.

1416
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:31,383
Speaker 0: And they're like, oh, my God, blah, blah, blah.

1417
01:12:31,703 --> 01:12:32,764
Speaker 0: We saw you guys.

1418
01:12:32,864 --> 01:12:34,707
Speaker 0: And I don't remember if it was Katsu Kahn or Otacon.

1419
01:12:35,027 --> 01:12:37,249
Speaker 0: And you showed us that gag manga thing.

1420
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:38,491
Speaker 0: And I was like the best thing ever.

1421
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:40,793
Speaker 1: We only show we had to be Katsu Kahn.

1422
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:41,814
Speaker 1: It had to be.

1423
01:12:42,175 --> 01:12:46,219
Speaker 0: We've shown it in other places where I'm trying to remember it had to be Katsu Kahn.

1424
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,482
Speaker 1: We guarantee it was Katsu Kahn.

1425
01:12:48,682 --> 01:12:54,910
Speaker 0: Anyway, we they basically said we will watch anything that you ever tell us about again forever.

1426
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,056
Speaker 0: And then they sat through our animation and they took notes.

1427
01:12:59,116 --> 01:12:59,657
Speaker 0: They took note.

1428
01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:02,180
Speaker 0: They sat there and they were like, hey, watch this.

1429
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,282
Speaker 0: Be watch this.

1430
01:13:04,244 --> 01:13:04,524
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

1431
01:13:04,604 --> 01:13:06,027
Speaker 1: Those kids are going to turn out all right.

1432
01:13:06,327 --> 01:13:13,200
Speaker 1: We also in the game tabletop gaming room, there were some kids who were all magic, the gathering types, but we got them to play some block.

1433
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:15,507
Speaker 1: And those kids are all right.

1434
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:17,352
Speaker 1: They are going to turn out just fine.

1435
01:13:17,372 --> 01:13:19,278
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1436
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:19,759
Speaker 1: All right.

1437
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,842
Speaker 0: Boston was bad ass.

1438
01:13:23,383 --> 01:13:24,705
Speaker 1: It was a definite win.

1439
01:13:24,885 --> 01:13:31,355
Speaker 0: The cool thing is, like from this meta perspective, as a con goer, you know, like I don't want I can't go to a lot of other detail because I didn't really pay attention.

1440
01:13:31,395 --> 01:13:34,920
Speaker 0: But there was nothing obviously wrong with the convention at all.

1441
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,243
Speaker 0: Like there was no significant problem.

1442
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:38,505
Speaker 0: Nothing got in the way of my enjoyment.

1443
01:13:39,145 --> 01:13:50,140
Speaker 0: But most importantly, I wasn't enjoying anime cons or just cons in general for a while now, because like last OdaCon, we did like six panels because, you know, we were helping them out and filling in some extra panel space.

1444
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,806
Speaker 0: And like we've been doing a million million panels and artists and all this stuff.

1445
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:58,413
Speaker 0: And I never had time to just do stuff at the convention proper for a while now.

1446
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:02,240
Speaker 0: This con we only did like we did three panels.

1447
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,205
Speaker 0: And then like the anime squares, we just kind of we were guests on it.

1448
01:14:05,265 --> 01:14:06,587
Speaker 0: That was the same as doing a panel.

1449
01:14:07,368 --> 01:14:12,597
Speaker 0: Got to spend a lot of time hanging out with people and going to panels and doing all the stuff that I like doing.

1450
01:14:12,617 --> 01:14:14,320
Speaker 0: The reason I used to go to anime cons.

1451
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,421
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of weird.

1452
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:28,200
Speaker 1: It's like I thought that, you know, because I had been to so many anime cons that like there was no more excitement in dealers rooms or artists alleys or panels because I had seen so many and been to so many that I was just like, well, if I'm not doing I'm not having fun.

1453
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:36,289
Speaker 1: The thing was right, is that at these conventions, I was having fun when I was doing panels and I wasn't having fun when I wasn't doing them.

1454
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:41,715
Speaker 1: because I didn't I wasn't really actually able to do anything because I wasn't doing the panel last year.

1455
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:46,740
Speaker 0: We were just exhausted and wrecked managing like a 14 artist alley tables and like all the stuff.

1456
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,869
Speaker 1: And I was spending all my time sitting in an artist's alley, not doing anything, not going to panels, not going and checking stuff out.

1457
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:55,934
Speaker 0: Plus, we had to like go and get our stuff for all these panels we were doing.

1458
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:59,720
Speaker 0: And we scraped the bottom of the barrel like we did that Advanced Wars panel.

1459
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:00,340
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1460
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:00,881
Speaker 1: It was terrible.

1461
01:15:01,281 --> 01:15:03,825
Speaker 0: Thing is, a ton of people came to that panel and they loved it.

1462
01:15:04,085 --> 01:15:04,325
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1463
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:15,920
Speaker 1: But yeah, so actually doing stuff at the con, you know, and especially because there were so many people there that we sort of knew, you know, that we didn't get to see very often, you know, convention friends, Boston friends.

1464
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:16,741
Speaker 0: Yep.

1465
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:17,903
Speaker 0: We hung out with Kat.

1466
01:15:17,943 --> 01:15:19,025
Speaker 0: She was that artist's alley table.

1467
01:15:19,045 --> 01:15:20,167
Speaker 0: We didn't get to hang out with her more.

1468
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:24,095
Speaker 0: And like we were going to go to dinner with some people, but we lost like half the group.

1469
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:26,380
Speaker 0: So we didn't actually get to eat dinner with Vega and all them.

1470
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:33,600
Speaker 1: It's like I was going to call up my former coworker who was up in Boston, but I got his voicemail so we didn't get to eat dinner with him, you know?

1471
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:34,221
Speaker 0: Yep.

1472
01:15:34,922 --> 01:15:41,692
Speaker 0: But Anime Boston kind of, I realized to strike the balance, we're in all cons from now on.

1473
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:46,540
Speaker 0: Fewer, more focused panels and nothing else other than hanging out and having fun.

1474
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:47,623
Speaker 1: Yep.

1475
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:49,211
Speaker 1: I mean, think about New York Anime Festival.

1476
01:15:49,231 --> 01:15:51,220
Speaker 1: You pretty much walked in, did our panels and walked out.

1477
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, seriously.

1478
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:53,447
Speaker 0: It was last year.

1479
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:55,273
Speaker 0: We walked in Saturday morning.

1480
01:15:55,293 --> 01:15:57,220
Speaker 0: We did panel, panel, panel and we left.

1481
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:58,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1482
01:15:58,822 --> 01:15:59,063
Speaker 1: Wow.

1483
01:15:59,964 --> 01:16:07,334
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, New York Anime Festival is a little different because it's mostly is just a big room without a lot of, you know, stuff.

1484
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:09,658
Speaker 1: But I mean, we didn't see anyone else's panels or anything.

1485
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,300
Speaker 1: And it was probably something to see.

1486
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was.

1487
01:16:12,182 --> 01:16:20,540
Speaker 0: But my love of anime cons is rekindled and I'm looking forward to Otacon more than I've looked forward to any Otacon in years.

1488
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:25,852
Speaker 0: Just because, one, we're only doing three panels and it's the same three stupid panels.

1489
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:28,800
Speaker 0: I don't have to do crap except rewrite the Know Your Creators panel.

1490
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:29,641
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1491
01:16:29,661 --> 01:16:31,172
Speaker 1: I think we're going to turn it into a clip panel, right?

1492
01:16:31,313 --> 01:16:32,260
Speaker 1: We got more videos.

1493
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,066
Speaker 0: Wait till you see.

1494
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:34,199
Speaker 0: I already, you should see.

1495
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:37,950
Speaker 1: Because I think our panels, right, tend to be panels where we just talk and talk and talk.

1496
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:41,360
Speaker 1: And we have some slides that would have pictures on them to support talking.

1497
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,623
Speaker 0: And that works well for certain things like anime.

1498
01:16:42,643 --> 01:16:43,085
Speaker 0: you should see.

1499
01:16:43,486 --> 01:16:48,200
Speaker 0: Any other format would either have to be two hours long or you're going to cut off like a hat.

1500
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:48,320
Speaker 1: Right.

1501
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:53,940
Speaker 1: But like you look at say like Daryl Surratt likes to do these clip panels where he just shows a whole bunch of video and he'll talk over it.

1502
01:16:54,280 --> 01:17:02,296
Speaker 1: I think we need to, we're going to do the in between panel where we have the talking, but then we have a significant number of supporting video clips.

1503
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:04,080
Speaker 1: I think that's what we have to go for.

1504
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,866
Speaker 0: Plus I've already made the shirotasm scale.

1505
01:17:07,186 --> 01:17:07,587
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

1506
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,150
Speaker 0: I like just from left to right.

1507
01:17:09,211 --> 01:17:13,740
Speaker 0: And I've got these like shiro heads that show you how shirotastic something is.

1508
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,543
Speaker 1: How many shiro heads?

1509
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:15,467
Speaker 1: No one knows who it looks like.

1510
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:16,732
Speaker 0: I made one up.

1511
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:18,458
Speaker 0: I found something on the internet.

1512
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,666
Speaker 1: Just use the major's head and grow it.

1513
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:23,335
Speaker 0: I'll have to use the different versions of the major.

1514
01:17:23,355 --> 01:17:24,720
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

1515
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:31,357
Speaker 0: But that, the shirotasm scale will let you know what Know Your Creators is going to be like.

1516
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,240
Speaker 0: I'm excited about this.

1517
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:37,737
Speaker 0: And the panels we're going to be running at Anime Boston next year are going to be interesting.

1518
01:17:37,997 --> 01:17:38,800
Speaker 0: Suffice it to say.

1519
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,000
Speaker 0: Yep.

1520
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:42,124
Speaker 1: So Anime Boston was awesome.

1521
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:44,349
Speaker 1: There's probably something about Anime Boston.

1522
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:50,000
Speaker 1: we forgot, but that's all right because I think we talked about the awesomeness enough to cover the base.

1523
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:50,781
Speaker 0: Yes.

1524
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:57,800
Speaker 0: Go, if you are feeling down about anime cons or you're looking for an anime con to go to and you can't get to Otacon.

1525
01:17:58,361 --> 01:18:00,686
Speaker 1: Oh, here's the one thing you got to say about Anime Boston.

1526
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:02,449
Speaker 1: It's very, very smart.

1527
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:08,040
Speaker 1: They separated the masquerade feedback from the con feedback.

1528
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:08,642
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1529
01:18:08,662 --> 01:18:09,525
Speaker 0: I almost forgot about that.

1530
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:12,336
Speaker 0: There was a feedback session and a masquerade feedback session.

1531
01:18:12,376 --> 01:18:13,520
Speaker 0: Weren't they at the same time too?

1532
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,698
Speaker 1: No, they were different times.

1533
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:23,535
Speaker 0: Regardless, they should be at the same time because as we've noticed at every anime con ever, if you go to the feedback session, there'll be one person who has legitimate feedback.

1534
01:18:23,535 --> 01:18:26,520
Speaker 0: 99 cosplayers complaining about the masquerade.

1535
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:27,018
Speaker 1: Yes.

1536
01:18:28,362 --> 01:18:29,126
Speaker 0: It was brilliant.

1537
01:18:30,211 --> 01:18:31,176
Speaker 0: Why didn't I ever think of that?

1538
01:18:31,237 --> 01:18:31,860
Speaker 0: I feel stupid.

1539
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,775
Speaker 1: I also felt stupid, but when I saw that on the schedule, I was like, genius.

1540
01:18:36,638 --> 01:18:37,040
Speaker 1: Genius.

1541
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,302
Speaker 0: Otacon, take a page.

1542
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:46,640
Speaker 0: because seriously, Anime Boston, the best way I can describe it, kind of in the vague terms, it feels like Otacon, but it's closer.

1543
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

1544
01:18:48,245 --> 01:18:51,860
Speaker 1: It didn't have the numbers that Otacon had, but it had a very large number.

1545
01:18:52,121 --> 01:18:59,980
Speaker 0: And while it doesn't have the crazy Lark on CL concert, California was a crazy, badass concert.

1546
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,945
Speaker 1: The production quality of it was just as good.

1547
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:07,040
Speaker 1: And the feel of the convention was an Otacon feel.

1548
01:19:07,964 --> 01:19:08,919
Speaker 0: It felt just like Otacon.

1549
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,935
Speaker 1: I mean, if you go to Anime Boston, Otacon is the same thing with more people.

1550
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:13,497
Speaker 1: It's bigger.

1551
01:19:15,782 --> 01:19:19,597
Speaker 0: Take everything that Anime Boston has and make it bigger, except the panel of rooms.

1552
01:19:19,638 --> 01:19:20,240
Speaker 0: make them smaller.

1553
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:21,698
Speaker 1: Right, but there's more of them.

1554
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:22,175
Speaker 0: Yes.

1555
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,055
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rem and Scott.
