1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,961
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 26 that this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:19,569
Speaker 0: tonight with our brand new and mostly configured Compressor we bring you our pre Halloween Halloween special.

3
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:24,955
Speaker 0: Let's do this Great googly moogly.

4
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,901
Speaker 0: We got a compressor and rim.

5
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:29,350
Speaker 1: We talked about it already and rim forgot to hit record.

6
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,565
Speaker 0: I was so excited about the new compressor that I just totally didn't hit record on the computer.

7
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:34,930
Speaker 1: So let's talk about it again.

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, god damn is it fancy?

9
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:46,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we had our old compressor and it was like 70 bucks including You know shipping attacks and all that and we couldn't actually get the power cable for it from the company.

10
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,549
Speaker 0: They're on backorder.

11
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:55,210
Speaker 0: So instead of you know, not having a compressor for another couple weeks We just upgraded and bought a real real fancy compressor.

12
00:00:55,912 --> 00:01:02,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually two compressors in one in each of them is fancier than the single compressor We used to have.

13
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,849
Speaker 1: by that we still have but can't power.

14
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:05,673
Speaker 0: Yes, though soon.

15
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:10,090
Speaker 0: We'll be able to power that one and I'm going to set up an awesome three compressor setup.

16
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,990
Speaker 0: That's gonna kick the dog dick of a new bits his ass.

17
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,227
Speaker 1: We're gonna have to go out and get like seven compressors.

18
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,981
Speaker 1: I'll be like, yeah the more compressors we have the better.

19
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:38,109
Speaker 0: a frickin be a wolf cluster Eventually of compressors will compress the audio to the point that all geek nights will be is Hi guess so Yeah, I got to say though I mean our old compressor had some lights on it and they would move around a bit.

20
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,423
Speaker 0: But there are some goddamn lights on this compressor.

21
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:42,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm really liking the lights.

22
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,587
Speaker 1: It's giving me something to look at while we do the podcast instead of rims.

23
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:49,458
Speaker 0: ugly ass My ass is quite covered at the moment.

24
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:50,702
Speaker 1: Well your ugly ass face.

25
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, I face away from you.

26
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,090
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

27
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,949
Speaker 1: That's exactly why I'm looking at the damn lights.

28
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:02,190
Speaker 0: Yeah So anyway in the news I would have saved this for you know a video game day.

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,683
Speaker 0: But it's kind of urgent because if Walmart doesn't fix its mistake tonight or tomorrow.

30
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,589
Speaker 0: You might be able to take advantage of this.

31
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,315
Speaker 0: Walmart made a mistake.

32
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,871
Speaker 0: They are currently selling Guitar Hero 2 for $79.92.

33
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:24,049
Speaker 1: Well right now there's a picture of one Walmart selling Guitar Hero 2 and you can see clearly There's a bunch of Guitar Hero 2's on the shelf.

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,205
Speaker 0: Well, there are reports in forums that other Walmart's are doing the same thing.

35
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:40,229
Speaker 0: It may not be all Walmart's We don't know exactly what the story is But if you live near Walmart and you want Guitar Heroes 2 As much as I hate everything that is Walmart go see if you can pick it up.

36
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:50,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, normally I would not encourage shopping at Walmart under any circumstances But this gets close to the line at which shopping at Walmart is okay.

37
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,761
Speaker 1: I mean they got a game out, but how?

38
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,750
Speaker 1: when's Guitar Hero 2 supposed to come out?

39
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,573
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

40
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:57,281
Speaker 1: it's supposed to come out a while from now.

41
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,150
Speaker 1: It's not like a few days early.

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,530
Speaker 1: We're talking a lot of days early, and you know Walmart does have a reason to come out two weeks from now.

43
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, two weeks early.

44
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:08,869
Speaker 1: God damn if some imagine if Walmart was selling Wii's.

45
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, two weeks early.

46
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:13,430
Speaker 1: I mean it's one for Twilight Princess Gamecube two weeks early.

47
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:16,910
Speaker 0: I mean imagine you know someone comes over to your house, and they're like man.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,590
Speaker 0: I can't wait to get Guitar Heroes next week, and you're like man.

49
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,858
Speaker 0: I unlocked the whole game three days ago.

50
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:29,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you have a ps2 Man, it might be worth it to go to your Walmart and see if they got the game on the shelf.

51
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:33,869
Speaker 0: I'll probably have some sort of follow-up on Tuesday once we find out exactly what the deal was.

52
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:38,629
Speaker 1: of course We don't have a ps2 and if we did well, we probably would have bought Guitar Hero 2.

53
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,440
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, you know it's kind of like.

54
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,751
Speaker 1: probably would have bought Guitar Hero 1.

55
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's the thing I don't get.

56
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:47,229
Speaker 1: Guitar Hero comes in a box with a guitar, right?

57
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,001
Speaker 1: What if you bought Guitar Hero 1 and you already have two guitars?

58
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:54,910
Speaker 1: Can you buy Guitar Hero 2 sans guitar?

59
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,169
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you can but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

60
00:03:58,853 --> 00:03:59,616
Speaker 0: I mean, I know you can buy.

61
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,805
Speaker 0: Donkey Kong is with or without the Kongas.

62
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:02,247
Speaker 1: Yep.

63
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:06,001
Speaker 0: That is true That is true, and the people who made Guitar Hero are not stupid.

64
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:08,350
Speaker 1: We should try to get Donkey Konga.

65
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:08,753
Speaker 1: I don't know.

66
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:10,650
Speaker 1: Maybe it's not worth it that the Wii's coming.

67
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,680
Speaker 0: I imagine there will be similar better games for the Wii.

68
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:16,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Donkey Konga is just something we'll have to pass over.

69
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,820
Speaker 1: We'll get some drumming games or use the wiimotes as drumsticks.

70
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

71
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:30,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was gonna save this news for Monday just like rim was gonna save his for Tuesday, but Ubuntu edgy F came out today.

72
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:35,080
Speaker 1: ish and Let me tell you this is not like.

73
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:41,262
Speaker 1: it's an official Ubuntu release Number six dot ten because it's October 2006.

74
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:49,687
Speaker 1: Oh, oh But it is not, you know the recommended default Ubuntu.

75
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,653
Speaker 1: you should use Ubuntu.

76
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:57,750
Speaker 1: dapper Drake still has the three year support agreement or whatever how many years they decided.

77
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:14,829
Speaker 1: so if you have a system that is important, like I don't know the server that runs your Website or your company's mail server You're gonna want to use dapper Drake because well, it's guaranteed and supported and all that good stuff.

78
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:25,932
Speaker 1: But edgy effed if you are using a desktop computer for Linux or if you're gonna try out Linux to see if you like it edgy effed is Like.

79
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,273
Speaker 1: I didn't.

80
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,980
Speaker 1: I was didn't think it would improve on dapper that much.

81
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,063
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

82
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,850
Speaker 1: Is it 10,000 times better than dapper Drake?

83
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, let me put this in perspective.

84
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:43,789
Speaker 0: I didn't even pay attention to the fact that a new Ubuntu was gonna be coming out anytime soon Because dapper Drake was pretty good.

85
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:51,690
Speaker 0: I was very happy with it And I just didn't expect that the line of desktop Linux would have been crossed with such a little fanfare.

86
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:57,850
Speaker 0: This Linux this Ubuntu Ubuntu is pretty much above the line as far as I'm concerned.

87
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:06,170
Speaker 1: I would give this to my parents without a second thought The only that like let me count the ways in which it improves upon dapper Drake.

88
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,750
Speaker 0: I got the big one that I want to say right now because it's gonna jump out of me.

89
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,119
Speaker 0: All right sound works like it does in Windows.

90
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:17,850
Speaker 0: It just doesn't work like it does in that It just freaking works and it sees all your sound card.

91
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,770
Speaker 1: It works like a million times better than it did before.

92
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:34,635
Speaker 1: There was a problem in Linux in which if you had more than one sound card or if you had Sound cards with multiple devices like for example my sound card it has analog holes Which normal speaker holes.

93
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:44,114
Speaker 1: it also has an optical hole, you know for the fancy surround sound optical cables the digital TOS link whatever and That's a separate device.

94
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:51,772
Speaker 1: That's device 0 comma 2 whereas the normal sound card is device 0 comma 1 or 0 comma 0.

95
00:06:51,772 --> 00:07:02,578
Speaker 1: Ubuntu Edgy F just detected it automatically and works and it also has a new dialog box that allows me to manually choose That particular hole.

96
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:13,510
Speaker 0: now while Scott's right and that it's not exactly like Windows I guess my point is that for most of you out there at least 90% of you It's functionally just like Windows because you won't have to do anything.

97
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,971
Speaker 1: Yeah There are.

98
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:18,670
Speaker 1: there was a huge problem and people having to jump through hoops to get their sound cards to work.

99
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,432
Speaker 1: That is gone.

100
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:24,910
Speaker 1: Also people who want to use that crazy AI GLX fancy 3d shit.

101
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:25,859
Speaker 1: It's now 10,000 times easier.

102
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:41,202
Speaker 1: All the software that you probably want to use like Banshee, which is almost equivalent to iTunes It's basically 90% exactly the same as iTunes new cache the thing that's basically like quicken.

103
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:45,738
Speaker 1: all that that software has been Updated to the newest versions.

104
00:07:45,818 --> 00:08:01,229
Speaker 1: dapper Drake didn't have that stuff updated to the newest versions so you were stuck using version like 10 when version 11 is out and a version 11 is 10,000 times better than version 10. and not only that but Ubuntu comes.

105
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:09,383
Speaker 1: Edgy F comes with the real version of Firefox 2 with the right icon And it's the real deal.

106
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,469
Speaker 0: take that ice weasel.

107
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:15,875
Speaker 1: It is the real Firefox 2 from Mozilla Unmodified beat.

108
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,061
Speaker 1: that beat that I didn't have to do shit.

109
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,467
Speaker 1: It was just there today today.

110
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,203
Speaker 0: Oh, no Yeah, we got it.

111
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,590
Speaker 0: Scott's got a thing of the day that's coming up for Tuesday.

112
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:34,249
Speaker 1: I could say a lot more awesome things about why edgy EFT is a thousand times better than dapper Drake But I'll tell you a few of the bad things just just to round it out.

113
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:35,595
Speaker 1: It's still.

114
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:39,590
Speaker 1: if you want to have dual monitors, you still have to jump through a few hoops.

115
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,775
Speaker 1: It's not super simple.

116
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:41,960
Speaker 0: Yeah as opposed to Windows.

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,410
Speaker 0: We're honestly it just works without any effort.

118
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, though you can't do everything you want to do, but it works.

119
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:47,410
Speaker 1: It's a good thing.

120
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:51,881
Speaker 1: I know how to set up dual monitors And yeah, but other people don't know.

121
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,005
Speaker 1: so it might be a little tricky.

122
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,350
Speaker 1: They have to edit a text file.

123
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,601
Speaker 1: Oh, I had to add like a few lines to a text file.

124
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,326
Speaker 0: God kind of Superman.

125
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:00,189
Speaker 0: Do you think we are?

126
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,590
Speaker 1: Gnome screensaver is still the default screensavers.

127
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,730
Speaker 1: You have to uninstall it and install X screensaver to get a real screensaver program going on.

128
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's easy to do.

129
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:10,660
Speaker 1: It's not.

130
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,309
Speaker 1: it's not difficult in the least.

131
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,317
Speaker 1: and What was the other problem I had?

132
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:16,823
Speaker 0: were there any other problems?

133
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:17,385
Speaker 1: there was?

134
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:18,590
Speaker 1: it was just so minor.

135
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:19,172
Speaker 1: I didn't.

136
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,959
Speaker 1: I don't really remember it right now.

137
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,524
Speaker 0: If you don't like brown.

138
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,688
Speaker 0: It's still kind of brown.

139
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,234
Speaker 1: Yeah It's still kind of ugly.

140
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:29,330
Speaker 1: You have to go to gnome look org and get a new theme that you easily install.

141
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:30,614
Speaker 1: You know it.

142
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:34,645
Speaker 1: it's pretty much dapper Drake with a lot of problems fixed.

143
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,390
Speaker 1: a lot of problems fixed.

144
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:40,567
Speaker 1: If you oh right wireless cards are still hit or miss.

145
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:45,507
Speaker 0: of course That's not the fault of anything other than the wireless card manufacturers.

146
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,589
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but if you have a wireless card that just works it just works.

147
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, luckily not as many people put Linux on their laptops as the desktop.

148
00:09:54,041 --> 00:10:00,350
Speaker 1: actually you'd be surprised that all the questions I get are people trying to put Linux on laptops.

149
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz that's what's hard.

150
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:07,740
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't bother well And also a lot of people get the old laptops for cheap And they try to put Linux on it.

151
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,030
Speaker 1: cuz you can't put Windows on there.

152
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:25,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can know all the old laptops come with a spyware infected version of Windows 2000. great Possibly a spyware infected version of Windows 95 a. oh yeah You realize I had Windows 95 a. I ran to the point that when B came out I did not update.

153
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:31,279
Speaker 1: see I went from Windows 3.1 to 95 B. Wow Because I had USBs.

154
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:33,813
Speaker 0: See I didn't.

155
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:36,439
Speaker 1: yeah a lot of people don't know this.

156
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:39,607
Speaker 1: Windows 95 a couldn't use USB ports.

157
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:44,940
Speaker 0: Windows 95 B Could kinda use USB or kind of being the operative word.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,870
Speaker 1: that wasn't until Windows 2000 that USB worked for real.

159
00:10:49,652 --> 00:11:03,999
Speaker 0: It was kind of scary things of the day Man, it felt real good to say that loud again to not have to worry about clipping or anything.

160
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:09,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a. it's a good feeling to just be able to say what you want to say how you want to say it with No worries.

161
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:17,620
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah And imagine trying to have free speech when you can't say you know or else it'll get screwed up.

162
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,347
Speaker 0: You know yeah Michael.

163
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:24,969
Speaker 0: You know yeah, all right, so stay the course All right, I think in my course.

164
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:25,772
Speaker 0: I think I'm geek nights.

165
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,400
Speaker 0: We really need to sort of to the left.

166
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,410
Speaker 0: Oh, no see we got to stay the course.

167
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,446
Speaker 0: my strategy all along has been to stay the course All right.

168
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:35,340
Speaker 0: actually no my strategy was never to stay the course.

169
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,180
Speaker 1: Well, what was it all right now?

170
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:42,020
Speaker 0: We don't always get that political other than when we you know yell about politics.

171
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,329
Speaker 0: Oh, but I'm not.

172
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,449
Speaker 0: this isn't a thing of the day for a political reason Regardless of any of our listeners or our feelings about it.

173
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,601
Speaker 0: my thing of the day is this ad put out by the Democratic National Committee.

174
00:11:55,343 --> 00:12:08,386
Speaker 0: now it shows video actual video of our dear leader President Bush saying that in Iraq We have to stay the course and it shows him saying it dozens of times over the course of years in different situations And interviews.

175
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:17,760
Speaker 0: all right then When it shows a very recent one where he says very clearly my strategy was never to stay the course.

176
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:20,390
Speaker 1: Maybe he was lying before.

177
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,764
Speaker 0: well the thing is oh the.

178
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:29,540
Speaker 0: a lot of times in recent memory a lot of the Republican and I don't really want to use right and left because that doesn't really fit.

179
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:53,367
Speaker 0: But the Republican current non normal conservative neoconservative Republican rhetoric has typically been to accuse people on the other side of being liars all the time or equating them with the enemy or whatever, but historically Democrats and Not left-wingers, but you know what I mean tend to be Tend to not fight back so strongly.

180
00:12:53,407 --> 00:13:09,280
Speaker 0: it's rare to see someone who isn't on the neoconservative side attack someone and I was very surprised to see this ad put out by the Democratic National Committee That pretty much in video straight up calls out a Republican for lying.

181
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:18,126
Speaker 1: It kind of reminds me of how an eagle they hire the guy who's usually the campaign guy for the Republicans To work on his campaign.

182
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:23,080
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so uses the Republican getting elected strategy in the Democratic campaign.

183
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:36,900
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess if nothing else I really want to see a lot more Both sides of our government actually taking the other side to task when they do something wrong Or they say something bad or they lie.

184
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,444
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean it's one thing.

185
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:43,783
Speaker 1: when we had like the negative campaign ads and everyone was like all these negative campaign ads suck You want the positive ones?

186
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,889
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that's true that.

187
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:53,931
Speaker 1: but the problem was is the negative campaign ads of the past were all So and so didn't blah so and so blah blah blah.

188
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,375
Speaker 1: It's just like name-calling.

189
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,518
Speaker 1: It's like he's a doodoo head.

190
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:57,080
Speaker 1: vote for me.

191
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other guy sucks vote for me.

192
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:09,040
Speaker 1: This is let's show in video, you know Demonstrating someone else lying because you could do this for any politician in all of Washington.

193
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,745
Speaker 1: You can make a video just like this.

194
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,470
Speaker 1: So I want to see all those videos.

195
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:17,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe it'll get people riled up because you really can't argue with it.

196
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:18,437
Speaker 1: It's like there.

197
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:18,839
Speaker 1: he is there.

198
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,220
Speaker 1: he lied.

199
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,509
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do about it?

200
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,030
Speaker 1: It's like when I watched What was that movie?

201
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:24,937
Speaker 1: outfoxed.

202
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,899
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like I don't watch TV.

203
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,852
Speaker 1: So I didn't realize Fox News was that biased.

204
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:34,119
Speaker 1: like people said shit all the time I didn't pay attention because I didn't watch news on TV.

205
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,802
Speaker 1: I still don't.

206
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:38,758
Speaker 1: but I watched and there was that guy and they showed him saying shut up.

207
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,820
Speaker 1: Shut up You know, they showed him saying I didn't tell I never tell anyone to shut up and then they showed for like five minutes.

208
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,403
Speaker 1: All he did was say shut up.

209
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:46,724
Speaker 1: Shut up.

210
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:47,045
Speaker 1: Shut up.

211
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:58,245
Speaker 1: shot as he told guests on his show to shut up And I was just laughing hysterically and I was like, oh Okay Now this isn't a partisan issue any politician.

212
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:59,409
Speaker 0: I want to see this happen, too.

213
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:06,910
Speaker 0: In fact, were I in some crazy alternate bizarro world to run for president of the United States?

214
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,341
Speaker 0: Or if someone awesome were to run?

215
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:20,544
Speaker 0: I would love to see someone Pledge that if they were elected any time they spoke to the American people at a press conference or publicly They would first have themselves put under oath by a judge.

216
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,629
Speaker 1: That's what I would do.

217
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:28,007
Speaker 0: I mean imagine that I would love to see anyone have the pure testicular fortitude to do that.

218
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:36,610
Speaker 1: I Would definitely do it right away because as soon as you do that, you know you stick to it and you you got huge balls.

219
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,348
Speaker 1: But then with the real long-lasting effect is let's say the president does it and the guy's president.

220
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:47,330
Speaker 1: for eight years He's not president anymore then someone else's president and they don't do it.

221
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,843
Speaker 1: They don't swear under oath every time they speak in public.

222
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:52,770
Speaker 1: aren't people gonna say, huh?

223
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,817
Speaker 1: How come you didn't do do it?

224
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,747
Speaker 1: The last guy did he didn't lie to us.

225
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:03,310
Speaker 1: now You can't lie to us either and the guy's like, oh shit It forces every president to have giant nuts.

226
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,558
Speaker 1: If just one president has giant nuts.

227
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,490
Speaker 1: or you know, if a congressman does it then you know Everyone will start expecting other people to do it also or governor or anyone.

228
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:15,166
Speaker 0: It has another interesting effect in that.

229
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:23,975
Speaker 0: now I mean currently it's not illegal to lie in this country unless you're like on court or unless you're Slandering or libel anger.

230
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:24,638
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

231
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:25,139
Speaker 0: Yeah all that.

232
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:29,013
Speaker 0: but in general, I mean if I asked Scott Scott How are you doing today?

233
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,161
Speaker 0: And Scott says purple monkey dishwasher.

234
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,345
Speaker 1: That's not lying.

235
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:37,004
Speaker 1: That's just dodging the question Yeah, which is lying would be saying great when I was feeling like shit.

236
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people do that all the time.

237
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,233
Speaker 0: It's not against the law.

238
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:40,639
Speaker 1: No perfectly legal.

239
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,490
Speaker 0: The president should be perfectly legal can lie to the people.

240
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,190
Speaker 0: There's no no legal reason.

241
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,225
Speaker 0: He can't say whatever he wants other than a few specific exceptions to the people

242
00:16:51,028 --> 00:17:00,390
Speaker 1: and in some cases He probably should lie, you know I mean Let's say someone asked him a question and it would look really bad if he didn't answer the question at all and just dodged it.

243
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,571
Speaker 1: But saying the true answer could be dangerous Like like.

244
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:12,489
Speaker 0: is it true that we have a spy named John Smith in North Korea ready to assassinate Kim Jong-il and he's like?

245
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,058
Speaker 0: No, it's not true.

246
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he can't say no comment because then people go Unless.

247
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:22,929
Speaker 0: now there's the whole no comment thing.

248
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:27,009
Speaker 0: There are government's policies to always say no comment about anything like that.

249
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:32,390
Speaker 0: That way it's not if they say no comment all the time that them saying no comment doesn't mean anything.

250
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know but you get the idea.

251
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:37,326
Speaker 1: there are occasions we're saying no account you.

252
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:38,330
Speaker 1: it's better just say no.

253
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:46,630
Speaker 0: But now I mean Congress can't easily Impeach a president just for lying at a press conference the way it's currently set up.

254
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,570
Speaker 0: He has to do something illegal essentially.

255
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:57,690
Speaker 1: But if he swears to not lie with under oath with a judge Then if he lies during the press conference after being under oath, well, then that's a perjury.

256
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:04,357
Speaker 0: I mean, I I swear I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky And you know, normally I used.

257
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:13,630
Speaker 1: I would think I'm not a hundred percent sure on what the the law is for perjury And while I would think that you know, it only counts if you're testifying in a court.

258
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:18,430
Speaker 1: It counts when the president's you know, swearing to uphold the Constitution is inauguration.

259
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, so why wouldn't it count if he did it any time?

260
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,466
Speaker 0: Well, the the simple truth is that in reality Congress can impeach a president for any goddamn reason.

261
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,990
Speaker 0: They feel like yeah.

262
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:29,993
Speaker 0: I mean remember when.

263
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:35,830
Speaker 0: well not remember cuz we weren't around when Johnson was impeached back in reconstruction days.

264
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:38,635
Speaker 0: Yep, yeah.

265
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:38,856
Speaker 0: Yep.

266
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:39,980
Speaker 0: All right, whatever.

267
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:40,864
Speaker 0: You've got a thing of the day.

268
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:41,346
Speaker 0: Do you not?

269
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:42,190
Speaker 1: All right.

270
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,878

00:19:55,638 --> 00:20:03,330
Speaker 0: we perused it fairly often in college But it was only when we were really bored and we wanted low resolution videos of people getting hit in the balls.

291
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:04,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, there wasn't much to it.

292
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:17,765
Speaker 1: nowadays It seems to be that it's not a YouTube or a Google video, but what it is, it's sort of a really awesome They picking really good ones really often, you know, they had what other good ones did.

293
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,690
Speaker 1: they have recently the Street Fighter thing.

294
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,395
Speaker 1: That's right.

295
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:23,729
Speaker 1: The Street Fighter with that's the one Don't see.

296
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:38,489
Speaker 0: Okay So it's considering that Halloween falls on a gaming day and it's also the beginning of season two We figure today Thursday the Thursday before the holiday Halloween weekend that we would talk about.

297
00:20:53,291 --> 00:21:08,280
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, now sadly I actually haven't really had a chance to celebrate Halloween much since I left high school.

298
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,972
Speaker 1: I haven't had a chance to celebrate much since I got into high school.

299
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:12,855
Speaker 0: I mean at RIT.

300
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,160
Speaker 0: We never celebrated it.

301
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Speaker 0: We just kind of some people who wear costumes.

302
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,596
Speaker 0: We had the big cosplay at the anime club, which I could I have some stories from.

303
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:29,965
Speaker 1: yeah I think actually I heard somewhere recently the Halloween is the fastest growing holiday yet at the same time It's the fastest dying holiday.

304
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,976
Speaker 0: from what I've seen fewer kids trick-or-treat now than ever.

305
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,461
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

306
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:43,539
Speaker 1: I think it really depends on the area that you're in and the time of day and the type of people You know, I mean it seems like the suburban Protect your kid.

307
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:50,540
Speaker 1: Crazies are not letting their kids go out because they're really afraid and they'll drive their kids around in their cars during the day.

308
00:21:51,322 --> 00:22:09,839
Speaker 1: But in areas where people are all cool, and they're not you know afraid of the outside world You know The kids are go super like the kids that do trick-or-treat are doing a badass job of it like they'll go to an apartment complex and do the whole thing just Every single place to get a zillion candies.

309
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:17,727
Speaker 0: Well, actually when I grew up in Detroit, I mean when we lived in Detroit straight up You couldn't go trick-or-treating around the neighborhood.

310
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:28,678
Speaker 0: So it was kind of funny and sad at the same time, but all the more Not really affluent, but all the people who were afraid of the neighborhood would leave and

311
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:29,220
Speaker 1: on Halloween

312
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:40,953
Speaker 0: They'd go to Lakeside Mall in the suburbs and they set up a Halloween there where all the stores had candy And they all the kids would come and trick-or-treat at the mall instead of walking around downtown Detroit.

313
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:49,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, our mall always had All kinds of trick-or-treating going on But I only think we only did that once most of the time.

314
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:53,350
Speaker 1: we just walked around to the same houses that we always went To and got the same candy.

315
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:53,975
Speaker 1: We always get.

316
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,069
Speaker 0: yeah I mean I used to dress up when I was a kid.

317
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,394
Speaker 0: pretty much once I hit high school I stopped dressing up entirely and I'd still go out on Halloween.

318
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:03,967
Speaker 0: even when I was a senior in high school I still went out on Halloween.

319
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,040
Speaker 0: We didn't go trick-or-treating or anything.

320
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:12,167
Speaker 0: We just wandered around the neighborhood or out in the woods in a small posse of punk kid Causing all sorts of punk kid trouble.

321
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:13,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed to.

322
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:18,569
Speaker 1: it looks like what's happening to me or To me, it looks like what's happened.

323
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,013
Speaker 1: I don't know how to say this at all.

324
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:20,916
Speaker 0: All right, where's mr.

325
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:21,960
Speaker 0: Period when you really needed?

326
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously, mr.

327
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,779
Speaker 0: Shoots and leaves.

328
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,692
Speaker 1: lingual Isn't dead lingual is dead.

329
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:30,396
Speaker 0: Good job.

330
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,962
Speaker 1: Yeah Great.

331
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:49,587
Speaker 1: so it seems like what's happening to Halloween is that there's a lot less kids trick-or-treating actually going on But there's a lot more 20 30 year olds going out and having parties and getting costumes like they're selling a lot more costumes to Adults and college people now.

332
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:56,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're having parties and there's a lot less kids trick-or-treating going on Even though that still does happen a lot.

333
00:23:56,641 --> 00:24:04,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to say the last time I actually dressed up for Halloween was I believe it might have actually been my senior year High school, but I want him in my junior year.

334
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:06,838
Speaker 0: I don't remember but I dressed up as dr.

335
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:07,260
Speaker 0: Jekyll.

336
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:15,847
Speaker 0: I wasn't actually gonna dress up, but I decided at the last second because I was nominally going to a party with someone I knew I should probably dress up.

337
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:20,200
Speaker 0: So I took you know my suit and keep saying, you know, see what you did to me.

338
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,359
Speaker 0: No, no and some black pants.

339
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:27,394
Speaker 0: You can't say 10, you know I put on a fancy three-piece suit and then I put a black cape on over it.

340
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:37,419
Speaker 0: cuz I had a nice cape and I Borrowed one of my mom's walking like nice fancy silver-headed walking canes and I just said I was dr Jekyll and everyone thought it was a really good costume.

341
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:45,120
Speaker 1: Okay Yeah, I think I must have dressed up at some of those anime club things in college for the Halloween costume contest.

342
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:47,131
Speaker 0: I don't remember you ever actually dressing up.

343
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,720
Speaker 1: I think I did a couple times.

344
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,710
Speaker 0: You dressed up as a katani when we were freshmen.

345
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,780
Speaker 1: that was a good plan to katani costume.

346
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:53,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, that worked well.

347
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,509
Speaker 1: But I think I don't know if I did.

348
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,779
Speaker 1: it wasn't like I went trick-or-treating or anything.

349
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:02,100
Speaker 0: I thought I think we do more cosplaying than we do Halloween.

350
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:06,460
Speaker 1: I think it's not a really remember and it most of my costumes from when I was a kid.

351
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:20,695
Speaker 1: I think once I you know what I had a lot in elementary school I would have those costumes where you would just buy at the store in a little box and it came with a plastic mask Of the rubber band that would go around your head and then like a big plastic thing.

352
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:22,020
Speaker 1: You would just pull over your body.

353
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:26,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld is a whole thing in his stand-up about that.

354
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:27,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had.

355
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,140
Speaker 1: let's see which ones that I have.

356
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,206
Speaker 1: I still have some of these.

357
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,312
Speaker 1: I was Voltron once.

358
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:31,398
Speaker 1: that was the best one.

359
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:35,693
Speaker 1: Wow I was Voltron with big plastic Voltron mask and a Voltron suit.

360
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,659
Speaker 1: See when I was I was a centurion.

361
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:37,920
Speaker 1: once.

362
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,869
Speaker 0: I think we both had the exact same centurion cost.

363
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,217
Speaker 1: I think I still have that centurion costume.

364
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:44,160
Speaker 0: I have it somewhere.

365
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,160
Speaker 0: Wait, you had the other one with the red missile.

366
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,087
Speaker 1: No, I was the yellow guy with the green.

367
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,054
Speaker 0: I was the blue guy with the red missile.

368
00:25:52,294 --> 00:26:00,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, the missile was just this Phallic looking piece of plastic that stuck on the arm and to shoot it You pulled it off the arm and you threw it at your little brother.

369
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:05,560
Speaker 1: I think one year I was a Robin Hood or something or a merry man or a forest, dude.

370
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:06,483
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what?

371
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:07,046
Speaker 1: It's like my leg.

372
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,620
Speaker 0: I suddenly remembered the full chronology of all my costumes.

373
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,552
Speaker 0: All right, shoot out of the blue the first costume I can remember.

374
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:18,060
Speaker 0: my parents dressed me up as raggedy Andy Oh pun when I was a little kid.

375
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,305
Speaker 0: I think they still have the costume.

376
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:23,520
Speaker 0: and then my mom actually made my brother and I we wanted to be Ghostbusters.

377
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,686
Speaker 0: instead of buying.

378
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:32,851
Speaker 1: I was just gonna say I can't remember if I actually did a Ghostbusters costume or just everyone else in the world did one and not me.

379
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,700
Speaker 0: now all my friends also dressed up as Ghostbusters.

380
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,412
Speaker 1: It was like some one year where Ghostbuster was the costume to be.

381
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:39,914
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

382
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,860
Speaker 1: everyone in the world had a proton pack.

383
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:47,739
Speaker 0: Everyone I knew who was a Ghostbuster just bought a plastic proton pack and bought the car.

384
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:56,725
Speaker 1: No I think if I did do a Ghostbusters costume because I don't remember if I did one or not I did I still have the plastic proton bag So I think I would have used it.

385
00:26:57,066 --> 00:27:06,404
Speaker 1: but everyone else I knew was making proton packs like everyone had different proton packs of varying shapes and sizes and duct tape and cardboard and God-knows-what.

386
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:22,220
Speaker 0: I think it's the areas we lived because where I was everyone bought it except my mom was awesome And she made my brother and I perfectly accurate to the movie Ghostbusters costumes right down to the name tags and a uniform and the proton pack was badass.

387
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:29,838
Speaker 1: Say if we had Skype right now I would call my mom because she probably remembers every single Halloween costume I ever wore and she could just tell us.

388
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:40,239
Speaker 0: Yeah So then I dressed up after that as an army man With a little 45 and Everyone else was also dressed up as an army man.

389
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:47,260
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember my last Halloween costume as I went to the to the store and I got one of those rubber masks.

390
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,672
Speaker 1: you know that covers your whole head and has hair on it.

391
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:54,571
Speaker 1: and I bought the Sickest ugliest one I could find like it was.

392
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,740
Speaker 1: so it was like it's scared with my little sister.

393
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,204
Speaker 1: She was like don't put it on.

394
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:03,259
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and I wore that for like all around town and people would be like you.

395
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:07,218
Speaker 1: I Just bought the scariest mask at the store.

396
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:12,480
Speaker 0: So after the army man, I wanted now this dates me in terms of my anime fandom.

397
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:14,549
Speaker 0: This was I think this was fourth grade.

398
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,902
Speaker 0: I wanted to be vampire hunter D Oh.

399
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:22,500
Speaker 0: and my mom tried to convince me that no one would know what the hell I was and I shouldn't bother.

400
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,438
Speaker 0: And then I thought oh I'll just make the costume on my own.

401
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:41,840
Speaker 0: and I don't know what my little kid brain was thinking because I assumed that I would look exactly Like D when I when I made a costume, you know, it's really weird though and all my years as a kid You know kids who dress up as Ninja Turtles.

402
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,237
Speaker 1: They dress up is you know?

403
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,444
Speaker 1: Transformers and okay.

404
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:47,588
Speaker 1: No one.

405
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:52,105
Speaker 1: I don't remember a single kid ever dressing up as Mario ever Do you?

406
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,058
Speaker 1: I think I remember Sonic the Hedgehog's?

407
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:58,920
Speaker 0: Actually, I remember two different kids who dressed up as link and my little brother one.

408
00:28:59,121 --> 00:28:59,744
Speaker 1: There were links.

409
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,568
Speaker 1: there were links.

410
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,034
Speaker 1: there were no Mario's.

411
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,240
Speaker 1: do you remember a Mario ever?

412
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:13,160
Speaker 1: Like I hadn't seen no one did a Mario costume until recently when it was all cool with the cosplay action at the conventions.

413
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:18,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cosplay action that Daryl Surratt is trying to Undermine.

414
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're really.

415
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:22,635
Speaker 1: it's kind of weird because now that I think about it.

416
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:24,300
Speaker 1: It's like wow, I should have been Mario.

417
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,566
Speaker 1: How could I not have been Mario?

418
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:31,320
Speaker 0: see it's weird because we didn't see our video game culture as special when we were kids.

419
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,465
Speaker 0: It wasn't nostalgic.

420
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:33,429
Speaker 0: It wasn't awesome.

421
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:34,372
Speaker 0: It wasn't even cool.

422
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,099
Speaker 0: It was just the way you were.

423
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:37,766
Speaker 0: Everyone was that way.

424
00:29:37,987 --> 00:29:40,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Voltron wasn't special either, but I dressed up as him.

425
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:42,586
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was.

426
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,436
Speaker 0: I think maybe it was because there weren't Mario costumes.

427
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,419
Speaker 0: No one thought of it.

428
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:47,664
Speaker 1: I don't know man.

429
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:51,777
Speaker 1: I don't know cuz Mario all dressed up as Ghostbusters and those weren't nostalgic.

430
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:52,480
Speaker 1: They're brand new.

431
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:53,563
Speaker 0: I don't know.

432
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:59,880
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because video games were just so ingrained and so part of our daily ritualized lives.

433
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,427
Speaker 1: I don't know there.

434
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:06,708
Speaker 1: I feel like there should have been a Mario costume back though Since I didn't dress up as vampire hunter D.

435
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:07,130
Speaker 0: What do you think?

436
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,300
Speaker 0: I dressed up as you'll never guess vampire hunter D's hand.

437
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,325
Speaker 0: No, oh god.

438
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,169
Speaker 0: I wish I was that clever.

439
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,243
Speaker 0: No, actually my brother and I dressed up as Arabs Uh-huh.

440
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,752
Speaker 0: Now the reason that might sound odd.

441
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,040
Speaker 0: my grandparents traveled extensively.

442
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:22,589
Speaker 0: I mean they spent a long time in Australia.

443
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,480
Speaker 0: They very seriously considered emigrating there.

444
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,547
Speaker 0: They spent a lot of time in the Middle East in Egypt.

445
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:42,435
Speaker 0: And while they were there they bought full silken wondrous garments and they brought my size my little brother's size and they brought them back and We wore them that Halloween because they were authentic clothing silk and awesome.

446
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:44,704
Speaker 0: They were the most comfortable things I've ever worn.

447
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,720
Speaker 1: we should dress up as Arabs and just walk around town on Halloween.

448
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:48,523
Speaker 0: You know what?

449
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:50,310
Speaker 0: I don't want to spend Halloween in Gitmo.

450
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:51,916
Speaker 1: I know seriously.

451
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:59,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's fucked up Seriously fucked up, you know, seriously, you know, it's seriously fucked up, you know Serious, you know, yeah.

452
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:12,579
Speaker 1: It seems now though that any time a costume comes up It's always a video game or an anime like or possibly an underwear pervert, but it's all video game anime costumes.

453
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,378
Speaker 1: now What's up?

454
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:24,368
Speaker 0: I have not dressed up in a non video game anime costume since I got out of high school With the possible exception of the lamest costume I ever wore Which is well when I went to the st.

455
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:29,987
Speaker 0: Mark's holiday or Halloween parade with Emily a while ago I didn't really have a costume.

456
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:34,300
Speaker 0: So I nominally dressed up as a pirate by wearing a pirate van.

457
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:35,526
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess pirate.

458
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, not pirate is also included.

459
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:46,599
Speaker 0: and ninja I wore black blue black jeans a Pirate bandana with the skull and bones on it and a shirt with a skull and bones on it.

460
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:49,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much pirate.

461
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:49,507
Speaker 1: ninja.

462
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:57,567
Speaker 1: anime video games occasionally comic books and that covers 99% of costumes besides the generic skeleton.

463
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:03,357
Speaker 1: sexy which sexy devil sexy Ness sexy nun.

464
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:22,615
Speaker 0: Yeah Though in terms of I mean one fun story about me and dressing up as things is that at the RIT anime club We had a tradition of having the Halloween costume contest Which was basically a mini cosplay totally off-the-cuff voted on by the people in the crowd.

465
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,203
Speaker 0: not terribly official or anything But it was always great fun.

466
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,026
Speaker 0: It was Halloween.

467
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,129
Speaker 1: So we had a showing.

468
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,340
Speaker 1: anyway, you know, whichever Thursday was closest to Halloween.

469
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,135
Speaker 1: We had a meeting where we showed an anime that was usually Halloween related.

470
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:44,427
Speaker 1: take the x-train Yeah, so all we did was we said hey on the Thursday closest to Halloween wear a costume to club and we had all the people in costume line up.

471
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:52,134
Speaker 1: they all you know took a step forward one at a time and Then everyone voted on which costume was the best and someone won a prize.

472
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:56,094
Speaker 0: now freshman year I didn't dress up as all at all because I had no reason to.

473
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,080
Speaker 0: I didn't need to whatever.

474
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:01,647
Speaker 0: After that, I was on the executive board of the club So I had to dress up.

475
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:08,279
Speaker 0: the thing is I didn't have any time I didn't have any skill and I didn't have any money.

476
00:33:09,341 --> 00:33:16,279
Speaker 0: Yep, so let's go through the three costumes that rim wore at the RIT anime club.

477
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:18,969
Speaker 1: the Oh my god is the movie cast.

478
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:19,250
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

479
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,275
Speaker 0: No, that's the second one.

480
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,560
Speaker 0: Oh see here's the thing.

481
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:26,890
Speaker 0: I spent less than $2 on any given one of these costumes.

482
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:27,552
Speaker 1: All right.

483
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:27,993
Speaker 0: All right.

484
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:32,189
Speaker 0: So first off sophomore year I was the facilities coordinator of the club.

485
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:34,640
Speaker 0: We were gonna dress up as what Star Ocean?

486
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,806
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It was Star Ocean and I was the dude.

487
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:45,712
Speaker 1: I wore rims trench coat and I bought a sweater and a white shirt at the Good Will a sweater vest and a white shirt at the good.

488
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,700
Speaker 0: Did you even know what character you're dressed up as?

489
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:48,663
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

490
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:49,225
Speaker 1: It's the guy.

491
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:53,843
Speaker 1: it must be the only guy in Star Ocean with a trench coat a white shirt and a green Vest.

492
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:56,080
Speaker 1: he's some sort of doctor scientist guy or something.

493
00:33:56,341 --> 00:34:01,700
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, Scott Johnson dressed up as the kid the guy who has the two dragons coming out of his bag.

494
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:02,992
Speaker 0: So me and Greg Hartman.

495
00:34:03,153 --> 00:34:08,639
Speaker 0: All right We were set up to be the dragons meaning we were just stand behind him.

496
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:11,239
Speaker 0: So because we both didn't have money weren't a goodwill?

497
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:18,460
Speaker 0: I bought a $1 red sport jacket and he bought a dollar fifty blue sport jacket.

498
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:21,830
Speaker 0: I then printed out the words were dragon in red and blue.

499
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:24,699
Speaker 0: We taped them to our chest and we stood behind him.

500
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:26,042
Speaker 1: Awesome.

501
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,411
Speaker 0: That was my first costume.

502
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,141
Speaker 1: I remember that now that was great And it was.

503
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:33,049
Speaker 0: it was pretty infamous for how bad it was.

504
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:38,612
Speaker 0: So the next year around we're doing oh my goddess That's the whole eboards dressing up as oh my goddess.

505
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,080
Speaker 1: Well the movie specifically.

506
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:43,880
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, so there's that big bad guy who wears like the white robes and shit.

507
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, sell us soap.

508
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:51,329
Speaker 1: So you got a big white sheet and you wrapped it around yourself and I was a little bit more ghetto than that.

509
00:34:51,570 --> 00:35:02,200
Speaker 1: No, no, and then you had that truck the square slash diamond of White felt with blue felt glued to it and you cut a hole in the middle and put it over your head.

510
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,784
Speaker 0: Well, see the thing is the.

511
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:09,100
Speaker 0: the sheet that I wrapped around myself was actually the curtain from the kitchen.

512
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,783
Speaker 0: Right, right I pulled the curtain.

513
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:16,817
Speaker 0: cuz remember I made the first costume a week in advance by buying that sport jacket the next year.

514
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:21,680
Speaker 1: I Got out of key made the costume the day of right before right before club.

515
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:28,580
Speaker 0: I got out of class and I had 45 minutes before I had to be at club setting everything up.

516
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:34,294
Speaker 0: I made that costume Including stopping at the store on the way home from class.

517
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:39,080
Speaker 0: in that time It was it was the most ghetto thing in the world.

518
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:43,280
Speaker 0: I even took a piece of felt in the shape of that thing on his forehead and glued it to my own form.

519
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:46,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, you glued up a blue diamond of felt to your forehead.

520
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,060
Speaker 0: I remember and here's the thing the costume actually looked pretty good from about 40 feet away.

521
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:02,016
Speaker 1: Yeah As long as you were far away and you couldn't see the stains on our curtains and you didn't realize that it was felt Glued together with Elmer's glue like from the back of the club.

522
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:02,980
Speaker 1: the thing looked great.

523
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:11,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, until you got up to me and you realize that hey that's just Peeling felt and you're wearing some white pants with a curtain wrapped around your waist.

524
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:18,500
Speaker 1: Yeah That's something I learned in high school from when they were building the the set for the school play.

525
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:19,382
Speaker 1: Mr.

526
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:27,272
Speaker 1: Farrell who was in charge of that would always if you screwed up, he'd always say you can't see it from your house Because at a play no one's up close.

527
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,780
Speaker 1: They can't see stuff from far away.

528
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,035
Speaker 1: So if you as long as you put it together well enough the small details don't really matter.

529
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:36,699
Speaker 1: people aren't coming up to inspect it.

530
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, except people.

531
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,139
Speaker 0: the problem was I couldn't walk.

532
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:47,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it was tight and I can't walk in a tight dress in that little shuffling kind of gate I would have just fallen over.

533
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,859
Speaker 0: so I kind of stood still at the front of the room announcing people.

534
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:59,559
Speaker 0: awesome, of course, I remember also that Lisa and Kat were dressed up and Incredibly not terrible costumes.

535
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:03,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, some people actually spent time on their cows.

536
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:04,559
Speaker 0: You mean everyone but us.

537
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:07,728
Speaker 1: Yeah They had awesome costumes and we didn't know.

538
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:14,791
Speaker 0: the club after seeing this costume and remembering my previous year's costume Realized that I was a cheapskate and rims.

539
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,400
Speaker 0: terrible costume became a tradition in the club.

540
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:18,344
Speaker 1: Awesome.

541
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:27,940
Speaker 0: So the third year comes around and now I'm the president of the club I'm the top dog and the club is talking about what they think I'm gonna wear and how little money they think I'm gonna spend.

542
00:37:29,023 --> 00:37:33,342
Speaker 0: So we decided to do Final Fantasy 8 Mmm.

543
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:40,074
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 8 great Just what we need more Final Fantasy costumes and giant swords.

544
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,640
Speaker 1: Isn't that the one with the sword with the gun in it?

545
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,638
Speaker 0: Yes, the one with the sword in the gun.

546
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,060
Speaker 1: Grumble grumble grumble.

547
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,506
Speaker 0: So we all pick things.

548
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:57,804
Speaker 0: that turned out that I happen to own a hat that looked exactly Like the hat that Irvine wore in the game and I had a brown trench coat, of course You never played the game.

549
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:59,129
Speaker 1: So you didn't know who Irvine was.

550
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:01,920
Speaker 1: someone else had printed out a picture of all the characters.

551
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I saw this character who looked pretty much exactly like me.

552
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:20,252
Speaker 0: and because many people don't remember this Well, actually many people don't know this because they didn't know me in college but up until my senior year I had Australian Cowboy hat out of leather that I wore a lot.

553
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,418
Speaker 1: There's a funny story about that hat.

554
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,040
Speaker 1: freshman year.

555
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,873
Speaker 0: That's gonna have to be a geek fable for some day in the future.

556
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:27,300
Speaker 1: I think you just tell it right now.

557
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:36,500
Speaker 0: It's pretty short now because we've gone on long enough and that story can be told at length if need be Alright, plus I have other stories about that hat and how the Hat finally died.

558
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:42,580
Speaker 0: But I didn't actually get to wear the Hat with this costume because for various reasons the Hat no longer fit on my head.

559
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:46,820
Speaker 0: In fact, I didn't realize until I tried to put it on right before Club, haha.

560
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:58,540
Speaker 0: So I had spent about two dollars on the previous year's costume and this year I didn't have much money at all as in I had like eight bucks left and a repossessed car.

561
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, my car was repossessed.

562
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:03,936
Speaker 0: I got it back a week later, but that should be a geek fable also.

563
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:04,999
Speaker 0: Yes, it should be.

564
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,297
Speaker 0: That was actually pretty hilarious.

565
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:16,099
Speaker 0: So The way I made this costume is I first off I put on some blue jeans and then I made Chaps out of felt and glued them to my blue jeans.

566
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,113
Speaker 0: Then I put on my trench coat.

567
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,040
Speaker 0: Well, I had my trench coat.

568
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:29,428
Speaker 0: I took some fake fur and I kind of taped it around my neck kind of like his trench coat was Wow, and then the the kicker.

569
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:34,400
Speaker 0: he wore this kind of blue shirt underneath kind of like von von Allen escoflone.

570
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:44,313
Speaker 0: I made the front half of a shirt out of felt complete with all the little leather things on it and I duct-taped it To my chest and put the trench coat on over it.

571
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,860
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Wait directly to your chest with your hair directly to my back where there's no hair.

572
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,028
Speaker 0: The shirt was on my chest.

573
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:54,379
Speaker 0: the duct tape went around my back and held it in place.

574
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:59,880
Speaker 0: Okay, and again from about 40 feet away the costume looked okay.

575
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you got up to me, it looked pretty piss poor Especially when I revealed to the club that I was only wearing 50% of a shirt.

576
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,078
Speaker 1: Wow, I really I don't remember that so much.

577
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,880
Speaker 0: But yeah, well you weren't there in club space afterward when stories that I'm not gonna tell happened, but it was fun.

578
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,949
Speaker 1: Well, why wasn't I there?

579
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:19,675
Speaker 0: I don't know.

580
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:28,924
Speaker 0: Well part of it was you weren't allowed in club space when you when nothing was going on because you quit the you quit the EA ship.

581
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I was still hanging out there sometimes.

582
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:32,819
Speaker 1: I wonder what was going on.

583
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,419
Speaker 0: I don't think we allowed you up there anymore.

584
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:35,088
Speaker 1: I don't know.

585
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:35,758
Speaker 0: you didn't get to see.

586
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:45,216
Speaker 0: It was pretty there only like four of us up there at the time when I finally took the thing off and I think everyone In club, however heard the screams of agony as I ripped the duct tape off of my back.

587
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:49,597
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, I'm not good at dressing up.

588
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I'm pretty good.

589
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,171
Speaker 0: now the matter is just money.

590
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,939
Speaker 0: now that I have money I can make awesome costumes.

591
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can too, but I need time which I don't have.

Speaker 1: we got geek fables of Halloween.

594
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,798
Speaker 1: I can't really think of any right now.

595
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:12,620
Speaker 0: We've got funny stories, but they're all more related to anime or gaming than they are to actually Halloween.

596
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,106
Speaker 1: I remember one Halloween.

597
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:18,223

603
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:30,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, if only we had someone to help us make that.

604
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:39,160
Speaker 1: I mean our friend Yuko made some badass pumpkins back in the day And well because she's an artist so she just draws something awesome on the pumpkin and then carves it out.

605
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:41,317
Speaker 0: And I know Emily can make a badass pumpkin.

00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:41,720
Speaker 0: You know what?

607
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,980
Speaker 0: I'll imagine just about everyone else we know can make a badass pumpkin.

608
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,495
Speaker 1: I might go get the internet to help me making badass pumpkin.

609
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:49,640
Speaker 0: I imagine that's going to fail.

610
