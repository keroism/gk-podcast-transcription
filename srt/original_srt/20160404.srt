1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,760
Speaker 1: It's Monday, April 4th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,281
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:17,982
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight some specific hadoken.

4
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:21,776
Speaker 1: no That's actually a weird inside joke.

5
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:25,910
Speaker 1: the show is about HFS plus and case sensitivity.

6
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:28,447
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:33,430
Speaker 1: So as you all know I was at Zenkai con this past weekend doing a bunch of panels.

8
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,969
Speaker 1: It was really fun con, but mistakes are made.

9
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,804
Speaker 1: Yes on the way home because Amtrak's the only way to get to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

10
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:44,261
Speaker 1: now if you get there with a car Amtrak's the only way to get to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

11
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,830
Speaker 0: get there with a helicopter.

12
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:48,710
Speaker 1: I don't think there's a helipad anywhere in Lancaster.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,337
Speaker 0: You could just a big empty field.

14
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:51,200
Speaker 0: I mean come on and you could.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,876
Speaker 0: you could walk and you could bike there You could motorcycle there.

16
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,710
Speaker 0: so on the way home, and there must be a nearby river.

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,817
Speaker 0: Can you boat that?

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,750
Speaker 1: our only real complaints about Lancaster?

19
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,484
Speaker 1: You know when we would go because this time Scott bailed was just me.

20
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:04,147
Speaker 1: go to the convention.

21
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,393
Speaker 1: good move One.

22
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,926
Speaker 1: there's nothing open on Sunday, so you can't get any food and everything sucks.

23
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Jesus town.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking Amish Jesus not born-again Jesus, and that is no longer the case.

25
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,510
Speaker 1: weirdly so last year on Sunday There was nothing to eat.

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,140
Speaker 1: We went to the one restaurant that was open and just like drank beer and had crappy bar The thing only thing that was open on Sunday was like the donut place.

27
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:30,720
Speaker 1: uh that donut place did not appear to be open I couldn't tell but that tap room was open.

28
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:32,125
Speaker 1: you remember the tap room.

29
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,755
Speaker 0: Yeah the one with the upstairs Yeah, there's two tap rooms now.

30
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:35,337
Speaker 0: Okay.

31
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,530
Speaker 1: There's two places called the tap room that are very similar.

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,630
Speaker 0: Why don't you just call if it's not the same owner?

33
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,679
Speaker 0: Why don't you call one of them like the keg room or something?

34
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,294
Speaker 1: one's called the something tap room and someone the other is called The something else tap room.

35
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:46,976
Speaker 0: uh-huh.

36
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:49,746
Speaker 1: I just we just call it tap room, but anyway uncreative town.

37
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,844
Speaker 1: so now There were like seven or eight restaurant.

38
00:01:53,884 --> 00:02:02,856
Speaker 1: basically every restaurant That's new is open on Sunday and every restaurant that was already there when we had last visited Lancaster Not open.

39
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,710
Speaker 0: I'm surprised there isn't like an ordinance that they have to be closed on Sunday.

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,003
Speaker 0: I was you who's in control all the places on Sunday.

41
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,149
Speaker 1: We're super hipster.

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,280
Speaker 1: They had basically the same kind of brunch food.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,370
Speaker 1: you get it like sage or LIC market here.

44
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,949
Speaker 0: Just so basically even Lancaster could not escape shitty pot town.

45
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:27,988
Speaker 1: Yeah And you know what shitty pot town is real great when you have to visit the town For two days and you want somewhere to eat on Sunday, so I actually had a really good brunch.

46
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,457
Speaker 1: look Sunday was fun Sunday was a good day, but then I went home.

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,650
Speaker 1: You know as you might have seen me tweeting Amtrak Hit somebody like my train hit somebody.

48
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,539
Speaker 0: Now well it hit workers cuz.

49
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,970
Speaker 1: no no no no you keep saying that that is not what I said yesterday.

50
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:46,033
Speaker 0: No No The news is lying.

51
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:54,610
Speaker 1: an Amtrak train like eight hours before that in the morning Hit a backhoe that was working on the wrong track.

52
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,673
Speaker 1: It was just a bag.

53
00:02:55,714 --> 00:03:01,636
Speaker 1: someone just pulled a backhoe up onto an active Amtrak line and the next train that came hit it And killed everybody involved.

54
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,450
Speaker 1: mm-hmm least everybody in the back up no one in the train.

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,378
Speaker 0: So the Amtrak workers were killed.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,450
Speaker 1: I think it was just regular construction workers not Amtrak workers.

57
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:17,650
Speaker 1: But so Amtrak's investigating why the fuck they were just like on the wrong track, but I was like oh crap Maybe I'll get a home.

58
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:26,259
Speaker 1: Then I look online and Amtrak's like no your trains totally fine because you're coming from the Harrisburg line So we'll bypass the actual derailment.

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,001
Speaker 1: all right cool.

60
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:32,308
Speaker 1: I get on my train at the end of the day and suddenly the train emergency brakes.

61
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,414
Speaker 0: Someone pulled the stupid thing.

62
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:39,310
Speaker 1: no so the train just hit someone on the tracks totally unrelated to that other accident train.

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,354
Speaker 0: You were on his train.

64
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:43,147
Speaker 1: I was on just fucking hit somebody on the same day.

65
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:49,426
Speaker 1: Yes So I learned a lot about what happens when an Amtrak train hits someone.

66
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,490
Speaker 0: sits there for a while?

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,869
Speaker 1: No, but I learned about why it sits there for a while because the conductor was a super chill dude.

68
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,041
Speaker 1: And I was talking to him the conductor or the engineer.

69
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:04,990
Speaker 1: the conductor the engineer was not Around to talk because he had to do something stupid.

70
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:06,634
Speaker 1: He had to.

71
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,463
Speaker 1: so the train hit a human being.

72
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,689
Speaker 0: killed somebody the train?

73
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:10,412
Speaker 1: no He did.

74
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,616
Speaker 1: so the train hit a human being.

75
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,262
Speaker 1: the guy survived who got hit?

76
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:15,129
Speaker 0: apparently what stuff Amtrak's go away?

77
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,430
Speaker 1: fat I mean there, but he was severely injured, but he was not dead at that moment, okay?

78
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:25,790
Speaker 1: The train could have just kept gone on like and left this guy lying there like ambulance.

79
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,236
Speaker 1: I came immediately like they took care of.

80
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:27,798
Speaker 1: that was fine.

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,254
Speaker 0: the train could have just kept going with this bloody smear on the front Pulling into Penn Station.

82
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:33,578
Speaker 1: Uh yeah, actually they.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,885
Speaker 1: they pulled into Penn Station without cleaning it off,

84
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:36,607
Speaker 0: okay,

85
00:04:37,069 --> 00:05:03,554
Speaker 1: but The rules that Amtrak has to follow from the federal level are so Ridiculous and overbearing that because the train was involved in any sort of incident at all Basically the engineer Himself had to get off the train and walk the entire length of the train on both sides Inspecting the entire train and sign off on all these pieces of bullshit information along the way Before they could continue.

86
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,782
Speaker 1: the train is over a half mile long.

87
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:12,042
Speaker 1: it took him a long time to walk all The way around the train and they weren't allowed to leave until he did it.

88
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,570
Speaker 0: couldn't you just like improve this with some technology?

89
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:17,640
Speaker 1: You can improve the cameras underneath the train.

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,228
Speaker 1: improve this Scott in any number of ways.

91
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:20,990
Speaker 0: a bunch of sensors.

92
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,416
Speaker 0: So like you're on an airplane, right?

93
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,147
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, Scott airplanes do manual inspections.

94
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:25,730
Speaker 1: the same way.

95
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,902
Speaker 0: I know airplanes do manual inspections, but in the cockpit.

96
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:30,810
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of lights that show you what's working.

97
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,512
Speaker 1: What's that?

98
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:42,050
Speaker 1: - but because it struck something even though it was a soft human who was very unlikely to have caused any damage to To the mighty train could not be defeated by the squishy human.

99
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:48,636
Speaker 1: Remember the rhinos the Rhino ads in Australia and Melbourne like don't fuck around with the tram you don't is a rhino six rhinos.

100
00:05:50,931 --> 00:06:00,929
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah the three or whatever hour delay was 90% stupid Amtrak rules and the actual crisis was dealt with almost immediately.

101
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,016
Speaker 1: and That was my night.

102
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,990
Speaker 0: How did the ambulance get down into the train track?

103
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,474
Speaker 1: I don't know.

104
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:06,574
Speaker 1: It was right next to a road Like.

105
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:07,288
Speaker 1: I guess it was easy.

106
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:12,276
Speaker 1: People were walking up there people were walking up and down like going to the front like knock out the window and see what was going On.

107
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:16,035
Speaker 0: and yeah, I don't want to go see dead bodies Severely injured bodies.

108
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but apparently this happens kind of often.

109
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:19,872
Speaker 1: It's called.

110
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,581
Speaker 0: they call you out of the person get it's like it's.

111
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,530
Speaker 0: you know, you can get on to the Metro North tracks.

112
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,299
Speaker 0: It's sometimes in most places hard to get on the Amtrak.

113
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,881
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

114
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:27,984
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

115
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,866
Speaker 1: No, no pretty much anywhere I'm they're just there.

116
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,770
Speaker 1: Plus remember the other the step is usually a fence.

117
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:40,102
Speaker 1: Remember when we were coming back from this go-to party and we saw two separate cars almost get hit by a step to try Is way like the it's on the road.

118
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:41,310
Speaker 0: you can get near those tracks.

119
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, so apparently they call you if you want to find out how often this happens.

120
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:49,963
Speaker 1: It's called a trespasser strike Because one person was trespassing.

121
00:06:50,023 --> 00:07:00,555
Speaker 1: Yes, if you're on the track Truck and apparently trespasser strikes happen all the fuck time and a lot of times and abstract trains just get delayed for a long time It's because of that.

122
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:02,002
Speaker 1: It's really good.

123
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,410
Speaker 0: Why are people going on the tracks?

124
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:13,959
Speaker 1: uh, so the speculation that I heard from people I will not name and imply who they were and seems to be corroborated by a little bit of Cursory follow investigation homeless people.

125
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,425
Speaker 0: They just wander on a train.

126
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,248
Speaker 1: It's like 80% homeless people.

127
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,916
Speaker 0: Are they trying drunk people?

128
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:18,780
Speaker 0: Are they trying to die?

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,087
Speaker 1: No, they're just following the train tracks.

130
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:20,590
Speaker 1: No, no better.

131
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:27,410
Speaker 1: You don't know better than to not go near train tracks Scott because trains are not well known in America to most people.

132
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:32,510
Speaker 1: You would be surprised how many people just walk on train tracks because they don't have no idea how trains work.

133
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,901
Speaker 1: They assume train tracks they find are abandoned.

134
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,589
Speaker 1: They just don't even think about it.

135
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,223
Speaker 0: So, yeah, yeah, I assume train tracks I find are abandoned.

136
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:53,530
Speaker 1: if like they're rusted and broken With Amtrak, maybe you might or if I have a map that says rail trail here But the picture the more the other 20% is drunk people who just like walk off an Amtrak platform.

137
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,265
Speaker 0: How many taverns tap rooms are right near the train track?

138
00:07:58,325 --> 00:07:59,730
Speaker 1: Amtrak shares a lot of track.

139
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,783
Speaker 0: I feel like you shouldn't give someone a liquor license if they're right near a change.

140
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:08,434
Speaker 1: Amtrak shares a lot of Train-track area with New Jersey Transit Which you can drink on.

141
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:13,250
Speaker 1: no, but there's towns near there and drunk drivers are like like when cars get struck.

142
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,844
Speaker 1: It's usually a drunk driver who just like parks on the train tracks.

143
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,329
Speaker 1: when people get by trains It's pretty much always homeless people or drunk people.

144
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,953
Speaker 0: This is the ban.

145
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,870
Speaker 1: alcohol suicides appear to be pretty rare actually compared to all those other ones.

146
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,885
Speaker 1: So I learned all this last night and I didn't get home till like midnight.

147
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,310
Speaker 0: Oh glad I didn't go there.

148
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,129
Speaker 0: I stayed in New York where everything was good.

149
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:33,636
Speaker 0: Nice mocha festival.

150
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,467
Speaker 0: nice, you know, it's small but good stuff.

151
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:44,063
Speaker 1: Yep I will return to Zen kai khan, but if Zen kai khan overlaps with mocha fest again I'm not skipping to mocha fest in a row because I really like mocha fest.

152
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:44,646
Speaker 1: It's okay.

153
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,496
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll talk about mocha fest.

154
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,641
Speaker 0: spent a few hours there went home.

155
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you get a haul?

156
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,549
Speaker 1: some comics will talk about?

157
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,027
Speaker 0: no I just bought one comic with your said this cat on the cover who had a knife in his mouth.

158
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:54,670
Speaker 0: It was ready to kill.

159
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:57,229
Speaker 1: Sounds like something you would buy.

160
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:05,190
Speaker 0: It sounds like something we would both buying but I think I think it was just called like no kitty No, and it's like, you know, the cat just messing stuff up in their apartment.

161
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 1: So you got any news Technology news that doesn't involve trespasser.

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,445
Speaker 0: Well, it's sort of a news.

163
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:13,470
Speaker 0: It's not even a new news.

164
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,750
Speaker 0: It's like a January news, but it's sort of like came to a head at least today for me personally.

165
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,361
Speaker 0: So delicious, which is the site that I've been using.

166
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,469
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah used to be de l that I see I owe us.

167
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,028
Speaker 0: It still is de l that I see out of us, but it redirects you to delicious.

168
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:27,410
Speaker 0: calm.

169
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:32,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a site that was made in 2003 by a super nerdy guy Joshua something.

170
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:34,030
Speaker 0: I just remember his name was Josh.

171
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,397
Speaker 1: I think we did a whole episode.

172
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,870
Speaker 1: We use the shit out of this at RIT, right?

173
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,645
Speaker 0: So basically what delicious is is cuz you know when you're using the web, right?

174
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,372
Speaker 0: There's two kinds of bookmarks You need.

175
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:47,330
Speaker 0: there's the bookmark of the site you go to every day, right?

176
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,789
Speaker 0: You just need a fast way to get there.

177
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,850
Speaker 0: It's faster than typing it in even or maybe it is a complicated URL and you don't want to type that in ever.

178
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:57,410
Speaker 0: Right, like the Amazon Web Services console, right?

179
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,175
Speaker 0: It's like you could be.

180
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,094
Speaker 0: if you're working with Amazon Web Services You might be using that every day.

181
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,402
Speaker 0: the login URL for that is like fuck you.

182
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,790
Speaker 0: It's not like amazon.com slash console, right?

183
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,968
Speaker 0: It's some nonsense, especially if you've got to put like your account number in there and shit.

184
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:10,310
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

185
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:13,109
Speaker 0: So you use the bookmarks in your browser for that, right?

186
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,981
Speaker 0: But there are some times you just remember URL.

187
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,070
Speaker 0: for example, I see a thing of the day on the internet.

188
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:19,620
Speaker 0: That's not like a YouTube video.

189
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,566
Speaker 0: So I can't just like it.

190
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:26,990
Speaker 0: to remember it I have to like, you know save that URL somewhere and I don't want to use my browser bookmarks for that.

191
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,114
Speaker 0: That's like a big mess.

192
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:29,519
Speaker 1: and also browser bookmarks like.

193
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,234
Speaker 1: no one has made a good UX for that in modern era Right, and it's not.

194
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:34,340
Speaker 0: they're not searchable.

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,170
Speaker 0: They're not saved anywhere.

196
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,320
Speaker 1: So do I know you say that but I mean like Chrome.

197
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:41,678
Speaker 1: syncs it across all my Chrome's like sure But it's not super like.

198
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,709
Speaker 0: it's not convenient for that purpose, right?

199
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:53,225
Speaker 0: 2003 delicious solved this problem with a really simple website where you could just use a bookmark lit Which you'd make a real bookmark out of and any website you're on.

200
00:10:53,265 --> 00:11:03,910
Speaker 0: you could just click that Regular bookmark and it would hit the delicious API and create, you know And save the URL of the page you were on and you could also put a title description and tags.

201
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,997
Speaker 0: But it also man the.

202
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,830
Speaker 0: it would automatically fill those in for you.

203
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,781
Speaker 1: So think of this an old geek nights days I had a tag to TD which was things of the day.

204
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,070
Speaker 1: then I had a tag Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday.

205
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:22,470
Speaker 1: So anytime we had to do a show I'd be like, ah, well I'm gonna talk on a Thursday and I'd go to the URL that was Thursday plus to TD Thursday plus GN news, right?

206
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,089
Speaker 0: There was awesome.

207
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,672
Speaker 0: That was the best.

208
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:28,210
Speaker 0: one of the best features of delicious was that you could find things with multiple tags.

209
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:38,790
Speaker 0: so like you could just go to like delicious comm slash like music plus Evangelion, right and you could search for things that way like anything has these two tags on it.

210
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,910
Speaker 0: You could find stuff there that you couldn't find on Google easily because it was things that human being specifically like wrote down.

211
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:57,825
Speaker 1: Like man, you did do an episode on delicious on November 14th 2005. yeah, so 2005 night on gig nights we considered TV OSER over TCP IP Google Analytics.

212
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,409
Speaker 1: Douglas rush coughs new book.

213
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a rush cough has another new book by the upcoming.

214
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:03,225
Speaker 0: It's calling.

215
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:08,278
Speaker 1: It's called throwing rocks The upcoming Xbox 360 launch lineup.

216
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:12,088
Speaker 1: then we discuss slash shot FARC delicious and dig.

217
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,694
Speaker 1: we called this episode Reading the web.

218
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,000
Speaker 0: All right, so delicious, right?

219
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,004
Speaker 0: We talked about it.

220
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:17,209
Speaker 0: So I'm talking about lazy show.

221
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,196
Speaker 0: This is was made in 2003.

222
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,460
Speaker 0: It was bought by Yahoo.

223
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,627
Speaker 0: then in like by in like 2005 or something, right?

224
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,170
Speaker 0: And then in 2011, it was sold to some other company.

225
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,236
Speaker 0: We I think that was a news.

226
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:32,982
Speaker 0: then only in January of this year It was sold to yet another company.

227
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:46,229
Speaker 0: that company Right, even the previous company didn't do as good a job as even Yahoo or you know, the original developer Yeah But the company that started in January has begun in like the past month or two, right?

228
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,989
Speaker 0: They start, you know, they didn't actually get working until like February March, right?

229
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,196
Speaker 0: Really making delicious bad like.

230
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,259
Speaker 0: oh, sorry.

231
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,001
Speaker 1: I'll go to the list.

232
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,185
Speaker 1: It still does.

233
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:57,850
Speaker 1: Hey, why do I see all this like?

234
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,981
Speaker 1: Twitter trending bullshit.

235
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:00,830
Speaker 0: No, I mean that's always bad.

236
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,764
Speaker 1: You've been on the front page because I've never been to the front page of delicious before.

237
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:04,930
Speaker 0: no, you never have.

238
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:19,581
Speaker 0: it's always had stuff like that, but anyway the You know, they just redesigned it more and it's like it still does everything It always did technically speaking but it's been like broken at times or down at times Popular way more ads on it than ever before.

239
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:31,857
Speaker 0: Yeah popular tags AARP Bible Real estate I mean the point is delicious is sort of like finally Jumped the shark for real like.

240
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:32,740
Speaker 1: what's wrong with it now?

241
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:35,609
Speaker 0: I mean you want to keep using that site now.

242
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,230
Speaker 1: As far as you told me the site's been like this for a long time.

243
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,154
Speaker 0: No, it's it's.

244
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:41,696
Speaker 0: I mean this.

245
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:42,981
Speaker 0: it was bad and now it's.

246
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,970
Speaker 0: it's beyond the pale, right?

247
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:51,390
Speaker 0: So I switched to the next most popular thing today this morning It only took me like 10 minutes, which is called pin board.

248
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,730
Speaker 0: Now the problem with pin board is that a it doesn't look as nice on the website.

249
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,250
Speaker 0: The website looks like a Craigslist styling, right?

250
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:04,728
Speaker 0: successful for a reason but you don't have to go to the website because you can just get like an app on your iPhone or whatever.

251
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,395
Speaker 0: that hits the API and does it that way.

252
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,263
Speaker 0: so pin board is not free.

253
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:09,006
Speaker 0: It costs money.

254
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:15,502
Speaker 0: Ooh It's like $11 or whatever A year, it's got flicker style pricing.

255
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:21,384
Speaker 0: but for $25 a year You can get this super pin board, which basically does everything delicious did.

256
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,010
Speaker 0: only there's no ads ever.

257
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:26,790
Speaker 0: And it's super fast like it's performance is like their goal.

258
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,434
Speaker 0: It's way fast.

259
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:31,853
Speaker 1: if there was a Twitter that just cost 25 bucks a year Yeah, I know right.

260
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:36,025
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's super fast and it does everything delicious did.

261
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:40,781
Speaker 0: but if you buy this super version for $25 a year, what could it possibly do for me?

262
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:43,110
Speaker 0: It has this amazing feature that delicious did not have.

263
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,900
Speaker 1: What does it find things of the day for me?

264
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,644
Speaker 1: It tells me what to do.

265
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:46,368
Speaker 1: geek nights on.

266
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,309
Speaker 0: no What it does is it's archive mode.

267
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:56,750
Speaker 0: So anything anything you bookmark it will actually take a download a copy of that page and save it.

268
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:14,830
Speaker 0: so if like you but if you make a pin of Some like article and then you delete that article or edit that article or mess with that article or becomes 404 you can go to your pin board and click on this button and see the permanently saved version of that site that you Bookmarked.

269
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:22,450
Speaker 0: Whereas I'm delicious, you know, I loaded my delicious backup into pin board and it didn't take very long at all.

270
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,541
Speaker 0: It totally worked perfect everything everything broken.

271
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:34,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the old old links Most of them don't work but pin board even if you export from pin board like all the data They give you all those backups - it's like those are?

272
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:35,510
Speaker 0: you know, those are yours you're paying.

273
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:40,490
Speaker 0: So it's like if you want to leave pin board Well, you can download all those cached versions of web pages.

274
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:45,044
Speaker 0: The only caveat is it's a 32 megabyte limit per bookmark.

275
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,461
Speaker 0: So if you like bookmark a YouTube video You're not getting the YouTube video.

276
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:56,890
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, and if there's like a giant giant JPEG that's a whole bunch of them like a big photo gallery and they're all full-size.

277
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,702
Speaker 0: You're not getting us warning 1.4 megabytes.

278
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,566
Speaker 1: download with care.

279
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:05,558
Speaker 1: Yeah So There is a fork.

280
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,085
Speaker 1: This is just kind of a weird.

281
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:17,830
Speaker 1: so in the road I've been thinking about this idea a lot because someone pointed out very very poignantly that Soylent is just ultra slim fast.

282
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:22,809
Speaker 1: But tech bros pretend that they invented it and they market it at men pretty much.

283
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:31,020
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah Also, they make it in shoddy dangerous labs and with no oversight and it's sort of a we're surprised The FDA hasn't and looked into it yet.

284
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,430
Speaker 0: I suspect selling it is food.

285
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I suspected so.

286
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,944
Speaker 0: in the United States the FDA will look into it.

287
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,128
Speaker 0: I'm surprised but why did they?

288
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,495
Speaker 0: why were they able to Sell it before the FDA like tint.

289
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,200
Speaker 1: I don't know we should.

290
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,630
Speaker 1: we should find someone who can tell us how Soylent is not gone.

291
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:49,063
Speaker 0: Do I know a person I could ask about?

292
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:53,322
Speaker 1: we do perhaps What that person's opinion is but this

293
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:55,210
Speaker 0: I never thought to ask that person about this particular

294
00:16:55,692 --> 00:17:09,349
Speaker 1: ideas like fake food or vet meat or everything, but when it comes to fake flavor Like Americans like to drink garbage soda the candy water But and they've ruined their sense of taste so much that they don't want to drink anything but candy water most of the time.

295
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,020
Speaker 0: I don't drink any and they need to constantly drink candy water.

296
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:17,579
Speaker 0: So actually even drinking less juice than I drink before Yeah, I drink mostly water and seltzer.

297
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,483
Speaker 1: Well coffee.

298
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,490
Speaker 0: I'm only getting the high cloud on drink coffee either.

299
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,521
Speaker 1: Why coffee is good for you?

300
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,556
Speaker 0: No, okay That's what they want you to believe.

301
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,750
Speaker 1: actually pretty much every study says they paid for by coffee industry.

302
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:37,961
Speaker 1: No, but there's a lot of evidence actually that moderate to high intake of coffee Has a pretty strong correlation with not getting Alzheimer's sure Or at least not getting dementia in a general sense.

303
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,307
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's Alzheimer's specifically.

304
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,728
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

305
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,089
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, and all the you know, just keep you know, justifying your poison.

306
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,074
Speaker 1: What about water?

307
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:47,422
Speaker 1: I mean with Flint, you know, you never know.

308
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,888
Speaker 0: I'm drinking New York water.

309
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,587
Speaker 0: Yeah We should test our water and see you can get a free water test to call through on one.

310
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:54,150
Speaker 0: They'll send you one.

311
00:17:54,411 --> 00:18:02,650
Speaker 1: So but we invented to deal with this problem Fake sugar which you know, like people don't think a lot about diet soda.

312
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,470
Speaker 1: But when you really think about it, we design chemicals that taste like things our body wants but yet are indigestible.

313
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,177
Speaker 1: It's like we're drinking sawdust.

314
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,370
Speaker 0: Oh, you can just use MSG, which is actually totally okay for you.

315
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:18,130
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but it's a similar but that's a flavor that the body also will process.

316
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,790
Speaker 1: It's just not super caloric or I don't know if it's even caloric at all.

317
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,570
Speaker 1: I don't think it's cool might be a little caloric and you'd be surprised what things are at least moderately caloric.

318
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,397
Speaker 0: It just makes things taste savory.

319
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:27,839
Speaker 1: I just got.

320
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,750
Speaker 1: uh, how many calories do you think are in like a shot of vodka?

321
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,635
Speaker 1: Vodka yeah, or like grain.

322
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,304
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, there's no calories in the alcohol part.

323
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are.

324
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,675
Speaker 0: it's only the nutrition It's only the potato part.

325
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,122
Speaker 1: No, it's the alcohol part.

326
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,088
Speaker 0: Alcohol is nutrient is nutritive but that's not something that like you're what I mean, it's just your liver does that?

327
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:48,430
Speaker 0: not your?

328
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,970
Speaker 0: It's not something like you would digest and absorb in your intestines.

329
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,289
Speaker 0: It's like it goes into the liver and then the liver enzymes break up the outer sky.

330
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,974
Speaker 0: That's not giving you any calories.

331
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:01,403
Speaker 1: one ounce of vodka 64 motherfucking calories.

332
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:03,087
Speaker 0: That's all the potato part.

333
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:07,403
Speaker 0: No It's not I don't understand.

334
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:08,890
Speaker 0: This doesn't make any sense.

335
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:13,544
Speaker 0: Anyway, chemically speaking so it can't be just the ethanol if you just drink how many shots.

336
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,490
Speaker 0: so how many calories are in a shot?

337
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,603
Speaker 0: Of like Everclear 200 proof.

338
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,678
Speaker 1: I'll type it in around ethanol.

339
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got to be zero, right?

340
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:30,730
Speaker 0: You get to tell you could spell it properly Seven calories per gram of pure ethanol.

341
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:32,795
Speaker 0: Where does it come from?

342
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,383
Speaker 1: The what is ethanol Scott?

343
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:36,447
Speaker 0: It's just alcohol.

344
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:39,208
Speaker 1: Yeah we anyway.

345
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:42,490
Speaker 1: Anyway.

346
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:47,720
Speaker 1: so We're also the people who invented a Lester.

347
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,543
Speaker 1: do you remember Alestra?

348
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, didn't that make people like have diarrhea?

349
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it wasn't.

350
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:55,097
Speaker 1: so the deal with Alestra is that it was a fat But it was like it was just like.

351
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:56,565
Speaker 0: it was a fad that didn't break down.

352
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:57,530
Speaker 0: So it went straight through you.

353
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,335
Speaker 1: It was a fat.

354
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,650
Speaker 1: So you taste your nice fatty nonsense.

355
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,266
Speaker 1: But it just went straight through right through your body like a tube and just come out the other end.

356
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:05,070
Speaker 0: that is greasy.

357
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,790
Speaker 0: So it made your shit mad greasy.

358
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:09,870
Speaker 1: So I was reading actually about Alestra a couple days ago.

359
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,001
Speaker 0: And also you didn't get your necessary intake of fat.

360
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,027
Speaker 0: if you just ate that shit.

361
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:19,469
Speaker 1: even worse it might have actually caused other nutrients to leach out of your body and oh, yeah, because other food is gonna slip right out like a.

362
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:27,146
Speaker 0: It's like food that would have stayed in the intestine and gotten digested and absorbed instead right out.

363
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:31,541
Speaker 1: so The only reason it caused all that like.

364
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:39,110
Speaker 0: it's like you're not gonna get too much nutrition If even if you eat like a salads all day and like the most delicious best salads if you're also eating x-lax, right?

365
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,719
Speaker 0: it's not gonna help.

366
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:59,753
Speaker 1: so Basically Alestra wouldn't have been this problem that it ended up being Except for the fact that the people who were using Alestra chips like they'd eat Alestra chips because I don't want to get fat They would eat so many more chips than anyone even reasonably think the human would consume That.

367
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,402
Speaker 1: that is why they're having such a problem.

368
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:02,790
Speaker 1: They're busy ODing on a lot.

369
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,639
Speaker 0: So that's how they got on the shelves to begin with.

370
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:13,287
Speaker 1: cuz yeah people tested them tested a reason What human being will buy an entire extra large bag of chips and eat all of them in one sitting?

371
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,527
Speaker 0: and apparently the ones that Are really fat, which are the ones that are Alestra, right?

372
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,054
Speaker 1: Yep Exactly.

373
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,765
Speaker 1: Here is a. I never imagined that this would be.

374
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:22,810
Speaker 1: yet a third way to go.

375
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,496
Speaker 1: This is edging into.

376
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,282
Speaker 1: this is one step away from.

377
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:28,370
Speaker 1: why don't we just put a chip in your brain that makes you taste?

378
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,689
Speaker 1: Whatever we want you to taste?

379
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,051
Speaker 0: Okay.

380
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you could do that.

381
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:32,677
Speaker 0: Take that.

382
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I could save a lot of fucking money.

383
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,010
Speaker 1: I'll hack it and poop taste.

384
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:38,629
Speaker 1: Send me a Bitcoin or poop taste.

385
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:41,937
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you can make a great.

386
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:45,190
Speaker 0: you can go to restaurant websites and taste their food before going to the restaurant.

387
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I hacked it.

388
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,004
Speaker 1: you trust a restaurant's websites not get hacked with poop taste.

389
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:50,550
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna hack all the restaurants.

390
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:55,150
Speaker 1: Remember the time at RIT when we printed goats eat all those printers just kind of randomly.

391
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,290
Speaker 1: It's gonna be that but with poop in your mouth.

392
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:02,405
Speaker 0: Did you see that the the asshole weave guy sent like he printed things?

393
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:08,310
Speaker 0: are all that racist nonsense Nonsense around like every open printer he could find in the US or whatever?

394
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, fun fact guys, uh, if you just use Google, right?

395
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,078
Speaker 1: There are so many unencrypted public webcams of stuff You probably don't want to watch.

396
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,690
Speaker 0: No, there's a. I think there's a site.

397
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,750
Speaker 0: It's like a. it's like a roulette like you just click next and it finds a webcam and you watch it.

398
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:24,170
Speaker 1: I was playing with a site like that at work the other day and you know what?

399
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,515
Speaker 1: I mostly found video of.

400
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:29,410
Speaker 1: it was cameras pointed at pumps in factories.

401
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:30,496
Speaker 0: There's a lot of those.

402
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,522
Speaker 1: so I guess there's a pump breaks.

403
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,010
Speaker 1: you'd be like, well, I guess that's the one that's broken.

404
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,176
Speaker 0: I've worked I've worked.

405
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,750
Speaker 0: I'm like pump monitoring, you know stuff.

406
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,070
Speaker 0: It's like that's a big deal because like in factories like the pumps are the things that need the most looking at right?

407
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:48,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're constantly have a moving parts You know, they need to be lubricated and powered and that's all you know, if you're in a factory That's like mostly doing its own thing.

408
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,704
Speaker 0: I think the one we were working for was like a corn syrup place, right and it's like.

409
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,230
Speaker 0: that's the most important part.

410
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,356
Speaker 0: Everything else is like tanks.

411
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,166
Speaker 0: You don't really it's like there's a tank.

412
00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:57,910
Speaker 0: have a leak or not?

413
00:22:57,991 --> 00:22:59,509
Speaker 0: If it does we'll find out pretty quick.

414
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,128
Speaker 0: So they needed all kinds of stuff like monitor the temperature and the vibration and all this.

415
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,330
Speaker 0: You know all kinds of things on all pumps most of the IT work.

416
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,772
Speaker 1: I was doing an IBM like on that factory and the fab was not to add to the things that are actually directly making the Chips.

417
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:15,370
Speaker 1: it was monitoring all the parts of the process.

418
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:25,030
Speaker 1: So you detect if like a pump broke or like something weird happened somewhere or or usually like yields go down like well Why and then you have to look into the whole system to figure out what changed?

419
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:31,190
Speaker 1: This is a fork that uses varying frequency electric currents.

420
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:39,090
Speaker 1: So when it touches your tongue, you can it can give you a a basically like a binary of salty tasting and sour tasting.

421
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:40,859
Speaker 0: So the fork is pretty limited.

422
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:41,925
Speaker 0: It can't be poop taste.

423
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,030
Speaker 0: It's not poop taste yet It can't do any taste.

424
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,415
Speaker 0: It can only do this all.

425
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:49,430
Speaker 1: it's pretty much as current on off if you use it to and level I think frequency.

426
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,550
Speaker 1: I didn't read the whole paper.

427
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:54,529
Speaker 1: So it gives a salty taste because right like already think about how useful that is.

428
00:23:54,871 --> 00:24:04,677
Speaker 1: So people who have heart issues where maybe they need to really cut their salt intake As much as you should not eat a lot of salt You should still eat some salt.

429
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of people like try to avoid salt too much and that's also bad.

430
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,729
Speaker 1: Well, you probably should because all our food is way too much salt in it.

431
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,588
Speaker 1: So well, I mean if you try to avoid a hundred percent salt You'll probably take enough salt in to be okay anyway, right?

432
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,590
Speaker 0: But I mean first of all, you got to get the IO died.

433
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:18,750
Speaker 0: right.

434
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,461
Speaker 0: the thing is people are always thinking about when they think about salt.

435
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:29,327
Speaker 0: they think about the salt like when they're shaking salt on the Food and it's like that's actually like if you shake salt on the food as much as blue apron tells you to.

436
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:31,334
Speaker 0: that's actually not That much salt, right?

437
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:35,350
Speaker 0: But if you eat like a bag of potato chips, yeah, that's way too much salt.

438
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, the salt that's like in food you buy that's already made is too much.

439
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,450
Speaker 1: I think about this say you want to eat your awesome salty dish, but you're not allowed to eat salt because of medical condition.

440
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,689
Speaker 1: This would basically make your food taste salty if you use this fork to eat it.

441
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,176
Speaker 0: Sure, and it doesn't there's.

442
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:54,370
Speaker 0: no it's not even like a Lester where you're taking in something into your body.

443
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,970
Speaker 0: You're just not you're just tickling the tongue.

444
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,255
Speaker 1: Oh, so that that's why I was.

445
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,629
Speaker 1: the reason I brought this up is when it came to a Lester and diet cola.

446
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:05,223
Speaker 1: They feel vaguely disgusting to me because it feels like we're like.

447
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:15,716
Speaker 1: it feels like this weird subversion of our bodies Desires like we trained ourselves to like something bad and then we make a bad thing to consume so we can continue to experience that Sensation.

448
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,456
Speaker 1: this is just VR This Thing this fork it's just VR.

449
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:21,737
Speaker 1: It's just.

450
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:32,601
Speaker 1: it's not sight or sound it's just tongue Kinda, well, no, it's AR because you're not just gonna like carry it around in your mouth You're gonna use it to augment the food you're eating.

451
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:40,290
Speaker 1: So this is AR not VR This topic here, but there's room for debate.

452
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:43,345
Speaker 0: That whole point is I don't need the salt version.

453
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,170
Speaker 0: eat the sugar version.

454
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,400
Speaker 0: That would also a lot more people have diabetes.

455
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:49,650
Speaker 1: no, I need these sugar cookie version.

456
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:50,552
Speaker 1: It's just.

457
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,543
Speaker 1: I put it in my mouth and I taste sugar cookie.

458
00:25:52,623 --> 00:25:53,709
Speaker 0: I'm hacking that with poop days.

459
00:25:55,831 --> 00:26:04,490
Speaker 0: Now, you know that'd be the greatest like if I could somehow get it to her like Like this cookies and if you steal them, they taste like poop, but if I eat them, it tastes like DRM on the cookies.

460
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,535
Speaker 0: That's right.

461
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,464
Speaker 1: Wasn't there that company that's claiming they're gonna?

462
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:11,561
Speaker 1: if you pirate stuff They're gonna hack into your computer and like take it for ransom.

463
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:12,363
Speaker 0: cool.

464
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see how that goes down.

465
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:15,749
Speaker 0: Go for it.

466
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:17,315
Speaker 1: It's like.

467
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:24,670
Speaker 1: I want other news because this will affect Our listener more so than most people because this only affects insufferable pedants.

468
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:34,720
Speaker 1: The AP style guide has decided that the word Internet and the word web and the World Wide Web No longer deserving of capitalization in modern usage.

469
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:38,150
Speaker 0: Okay, I agree that World Wide Web should not be capitalized.

470
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,756
Speaker 0: Well, because I don't.

471
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:40,129
Speaker 0: the World Wide Web is not a thing.

472
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:48,360
Speaker 1: I agree with that but I want to qualify that by saying that the World Wide Web was a thing and We killed it and it no longer exists.

473
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:49,990
Speaker 0: It was never a thing right thing.

474
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:57,412
Speaker 1: All you're doing right is it and there was a time when the internet was just a collection of static web pages that were hyperlinked To one another.

475
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,038
Speaker 0: that's not true at all.

476
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,546
Speaker 0: In fact, the web came way after the internet started.

477
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,679
Speaker 0: Yeah the internet That's the problem as a consumer internet.

478
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:05,583
Speaker 1: You want to get pedantic?

479
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:06,045
Speaker 1: Let's go.

480
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,130
Speaker 0: No, that's not true at all.

481
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,708
Speaker 0: In fact the shit like prodigy for it came out for consumers way before the.

482
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:14,790
Speaker 1: you know HTTP and the World Wide Web was a revolution beyond that.

483
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:16,857
Speaker 0: No the World Wide Web is not even a thing is this?

484
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,694
Speaker 0: and the problem is the fact that people created the term World Wide Web to Refer to.

485
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:29,888
Speaker 0: you know web browsers and HTTP Made people think that the entire internet was HTTP and web browsers and that they don't realize like oh like.

486
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,810
Speaker 0: well Well, it gives all these other protocols for communicating over the internet.

487
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:42,210
Speaker 1: Most people thought that was that that was right as the growth of people accessing internet technology was skyrocketing.

488
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:52,007
Speaker 1: So the like pretty much within a year of the World Wide Web existing in any practical sense Probably the majority of people using the internet in any way had only ever experienced it.

489
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,690
Speaker 0: anyway I disagree that internet should not be capitalized.

490
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:12,371
Speaker 0: See if the internet is a thing and if you want to give a like if you want to say that like Chicago should be capitalized with a capital C then Then the internet as in the one and only big internet that the whole world is connected to should be capitalized with a capital I.

491
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:15,401
Speaker 1: so they pointed out that the reason for this is that very few people like.

492
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:18,653
Speaker 1: the word internet is used most often without the Definite article.

493
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:23,248
Speaker 1: it's used as a descriptor like an internet blah, then you should definitely lowercase it.

494
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:32,529
Speaker 1: in that case Yeah, and I I will do that, but I agree with you I will continue to get right if you want to when you're referring to it as the place where my culture lives.

495
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:41,810
Speaker 0: Right, if you want to talk about the internet as in the one then you need to use a capital I. But you know if you want to talk about yeah, you know on internet, right?

496
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:48,069
Speaker 0: Well, I think internet has an adjective like, you know as something as we discussed before we started recording the show.

497
00:28:48,714 --> 00:28:58,954
Speaker 1: No, well actually no, you know No one ever you no one ever in the modern era like for decades has actually said internet to mean Networks that were connected.

498
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:05,010
Speaker 1: okay there that are not on the internet the word intranet ended up encompassing everything that's not on the internet.

499
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, people people use the word intranet to describe internets when they shouldn't.

500
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,990
Speaker 1: yes, cuz intranet now just means private network.

501
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,453
Speaker 0: But you know what?

502
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:13,279
Speaker 0: I'm gonna disagree.

503
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:20,574
Speaker 0: I think if you're talking about say An internet protocol right for example, yeah Well, you wouldn't.

504
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:32,817
Speaker 1: you don't capitalize highway system protocol the highway systems not capitalized That's true, but if you're over but interstate I think is well You're thinking about the wrong thing.

505
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:42,676
Speaker 0: if someone writes New York bagel you don't Uncapitalized New York because it's being used as an adjective Chicago pizza, which isn't pizza.

506
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:45,544
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it would just be called pizza and not Chicago pizza.

507
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,390
Speaker 0: You still capitalize Chicago.

508
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:51,608
Speaker 0: Whoo, there's a you want to write, you know Turkish citizen.

509
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:55,183
Speaker 0: You don't Uncapitalized Turkish, ah, but what?

510
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:59,762
Speaker 1: as much as I'd like this to be true We can't actually live in internet yet and it's not a sovereign nation.

511
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:01,106
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean anything.

512
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:02,150
Speaker 0: It's still a proper noun.

513
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:05,488
Speaker 0: It is a specific one and only thing and not one of met.

514
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,061
Speaker 0: You know, it's like when you talk about a pie.

515
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:15,030
Speaker 1: so Scott as long as I can tell you style guides You have to capitalize the word interstate because it refers to the interstate road system in the United States.

516
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,878
Speaker 1: So if interstates capitalize,

517
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:20,912
Speaker 0: I think if you're talking about the interstate but not on Interstates, but

518
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:28,934
Speaker 1: no one uses that terminology and if you refer to a specific road like i-10 you have to say interstate 10 Capitalized I

519
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:36,097
Speaker 0: well, but if you were gonna talk about like a rim right not the rim But a rim would you uncapitalized rim in that case?

520
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:36,739
Speaker 1: in that case?

521
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:40,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would I don't know except there's no generic case For please.

522
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:42,299
Speaker 0: I'm just saying the AP got it wrong.

523
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:42,941
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

524
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:44,929
Speaker 0: They're trying to disrespect internet.

525
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:48,761
Speaker 0: We should we should uncapitalize AP just be like app.

526
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:56,096
Speaker 1: there are a lot of deleted Wikipedia articles and Arguments about the deletion of what.

527
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:59,609
Speaker 0: could be someone trying to go around all of Wikipedia uncapitalizing internet?

528
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,348
Speaker 0: now They're there.

529
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,947
Speaker 1: So the category was interstate highways in Alabama and apparently there was there.

530
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:09,690
Speaker 1: someone was trying to make a page interstate highways in every state.

531
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,770
Speaker 0: Why don't they just make the interstate highway system page?

532
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:17,943
Speaker 0: I just split up the states.

533
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:24,547
Speaker 1: I just found a Fascinating world that I do not want to step too much deeper in because I'm gonna read these pages all night.

534
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:29,506
Speaker 0: every Wikipedia Article has something like this if you just click on the discussion tab talk tab.

535
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,630
Speaker 0: That's why I don't click on that shit.

536
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, go for it.

537
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:36,330
Speaker 1: There's clearly no consensus in the use of uppercase H. That's what H. Why are they talking for highway?

538
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah highway is not capitalized.

539
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,267
Speaker 1: There's some people here really wanted to be capitalized.

540
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:42,150
Speaker 1: their arguments are stupid.

541
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:55,660
Speaker 0: well if I was talking about for example the Scott-rubin highway you would capitalize highway, but if you're talking about a highway like I'll take the highway Even though it's high road in that song, but you would You already undermine your own argument.

542
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,330
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I'm gonna take a ride on the highway.

543
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:11,560
Speaker 1: I would lowercase highway in that sense, but I guess the the useful categories today are intranet Internet is the Internet and then extranet is just basically like Basically replaced lands except they're private.

544
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:13,950
Speaker 1: They're only really used by enterprise companies.

545
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,279
Speaker 0: They're really just intranets.

546
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:26,269
Speaker 0: when a company has multiple canvases or Between companies like a bunch of companies will like if you're in the Google office in New York You need to be able to connect on the same network to the Google office in California.

547
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,610
Speaker 1: That's just a. when an extranet is more like say Google Amazon Yahoo!

548
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,670
Speaker 1: And ten other companies said we need to all communicate with each other.

549
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what everyone uses for that.

550
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,197
Speaker 0: just eat the Internet Yeah, but well no.

551
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:41,410
Speaker 1: so finance and there are a bunch of other industries.

552
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:47,710
Speaker 1: They use extranets where they sort of all agree and just directly connect infrastructure to each other and make their own internet.

553
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:51,809
Speaker 0: I mean do they do this like in a single data center, or is like Verizon helping them out?

554
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:55,490
Speaker 1: They do it across data centers, and they work with multiple vendors to make it happen.

555
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,755
Speaker 1: But the idea is you can connect through these networks to other people in a semi-public fashion within the network With varying levels of security.

556
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:03,919
Speaker 0: Does it have its own DNS?

557
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:06,207
Speaker 1: It's basically an invite only private internet.

558
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:06,830
Speaker 0: Does it use IP?

559
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:09,721
Speaker 0: Basically, yeah.

560
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:10,710
Speaker 0: Did they have their own DNS?

561
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually cuz everyone's running their own DNS internally for all these basically a bunch of intro.

562
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like how do you fucking find that?

563
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,030
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of intranets connected together.

564
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:25,775
Speaker 1: So actually extranets are what the generic case of the word internet was but because we don't use the word for that anymore We call it extranets.

565
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:37,453
Speaker 1: So extranets and intranets are lowercase I. The internet is uppercase I. All other uses of internet are lowercase I. That is my position Whatever.

566
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:40,090
Speaker 0: I'm gonna keep up keep an internet uppercase.

567
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:51,742
Speaker 1: Also, you're not allowed per the style guide to use the two-letter abbreviations of US state names anymore because it's confusing to people who don't Live in America and apparently it's confusing to a lot of people who live in America now.

568
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:56,036
Speaker 0: Tell me what is the two-letter Abbreviation.

569
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:56,901
Speaker 1: Montana or Maine?

570
00:33:56,921 --> 00:34:00,375
Speaker 1: Those are the ones that mess people up usually For Maine.

571
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,399
Speaker 1: Maine is ME, right?

572
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:01,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

573
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:02,543
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

574
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:03,688
Speaker 0: I'm reasonably sure.

575
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:04,230
Speaker 0: What's Missouri?

576
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,195
Speaker 1: M.O.

577
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:07,262
Speaker 0: I think you're right.

578
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:14,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know my shit Because Montana is MT, I'm pretty sure.

579
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:16,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maine is ME, so I'm good.

580
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:16,967
Speaker 0: And then Mississippi.

581
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:29,502
Speaker 1: I'm I Am I, cricket letter, cricket letter, I, cricket letter, cricket letter, I, humpback, humpback, I Things of the day.

582
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:30,469
Speaker 0: Oh shit, what was my thing of the day?

583
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,933
Speaker 1: So, all right, I'm gonna talk a little bit about Angola's Wikipedia pirates Mm-hmm.

584
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:40,636
Speaker 1: This is a cool thing that's happening But there's a whole- This is too weird.

585
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,625
Speaker 0: Angola, Wikipedia, pirate, those are three words that don't go together.

586
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,489
Speaker 1: Oh, and it relates to digital colonialism.

587
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:57,394
Speaker 1: So the article is fascinating because basically you're gonna hit a bunch of topics that are themselves fascinating by looking at this and This is sort of like a whole of stuff You probably have not encountered.

588
00:34:57,735 --> 00:35:05,339
Speaker 1: but the angle that the entry point of this whole article is that Wikipedia Wikimedia, so Wikipedia and you know, like all the other line.

589
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,810
Speaker 0: Wikipedia is run by the Wikimedia Foundation, which does other things also.

590
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not just Wikipedia.

591
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,878
Speaker 0: Mostly they run Wikipedia.

592
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,270
Speaker 1: Like they have hosting for like public domain stuff.

593
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:15,116
Speaker 0: They do a lot of shit.

594
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:25,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Facebook got together I think some other companies are involved too, to give Angola free access to their websites But not the rest of the internet, the whole net neutrality thing, but they did this.

595
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:38,097
Speaker 1: No, yes, and I while I think that's shitty if you- India said no, India took the smart route But India has a lot more developed infrastructure than Angola In a lot of ways.

596
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:39,950
Speaker 0: You should have said give me the whole internet.

597
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:41,394
Speaker 0: So anyway, this exists.

598
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:46,230
Speaker 1: So if you're in Angola, you have free access to Wikipedia, Facebook, and a few other things.

599
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,320
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna quote the article.

600
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:57,490
Speaker 1: So naturally Angolans have started hiding pirated movies and music in Wikipedia articles and linking to them on closed Facebook groups.

601
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:07,652
Speaker 1: And The degree to which nerds in Angola have hacked Wikipedia to hide pirated material is amazing.

602
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:17,488
Speaker 1: Like copy-pasting an entire novel into a rarely read Wikipedia article Telling other people and everyone just goes that article and copy-paste it out for as long as they can before someone fixes it.

603
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:19,640
Speaker 0: Good job Angola.

604
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:22,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is widespread and Amazing.

605
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:25,209
Speaker 0: Maybe you should give people the whole internet next time.

606
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:31,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, so never discount, you know, as much as you know stuff goes out around the world.

607
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,956
Speaker 1: go Angola never That.

608
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:40,294
Speaker 1: if there's a place with nerds and they have access to an internet It's your birthday.

609
00:36:40,595 --> 00:36:41,880
Speaker 1: nature finds a way.

610
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:42,985
Speaker 0: go Angola.

611
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:44,250
Speaker 0: You're my heroes.

612
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,425
Speaker 1: You got a thing of the day like the 90s.

613
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:50,798
Speaker 0: You got a thing of the day Yeah, so here is see.

614
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:54,330
Speaker 0: I don't know how many people listening have used an Apple to computer.

615
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,437
Speaker 0: I suspect all the old ones.

616
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:56,464
Speaker 0: I have some in my closet.

617
00:36:56,484 --> 00:37:01,770
Speaker 0: I have one in my closet The Apple to computer the original one that cost like a zillion dollars.

618
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:08,222
Speaker 0: I think it costs like over a thousand dollars originally and no one could afford that in 1980 something That was like a million dollars in 1980, whatever.

619
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:14,509
Speaker 0: It had a problem and that you could only use cassette tapes with it Which is like the style of the times.

620
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:22,490
Speaker 0: so you would like you would plug in a cassette tape rewind it press play and it would load the whole program into the Apple to and then you could use it right and that sucked.

621
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,570
Speaker 0: They wanted to use discs with the Apple to and using this with the Apple to.

622
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,199
Speaker 0: well They didn't have a disk drive originally.

623
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,070
Speaker 0: now they have one, but they didn't originally have one.

624
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:35,810
Speaker 0: So Steve Wozniak made the hardware for it and his hardware was like this genius hardware.

625
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:39,770
Speaker 0: I have some of the boards that do this because I have extra floppy drives.

626
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:46,680
Speaker 0: Yeah and I have the exact boards that like the Steve Wozniak design and Basically, it's a. it's the genius of that design.

627
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,504
Speaker 0: people don't realize.

628
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:48,670
Speaker 0: is that up until that point?

629
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,318
Speaker 0: Floppy disk controllers are mad expensive.

630
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:51,800
Speaker 0: Yes.

631
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,446
Speaker 0: They were all hardware, right?

632
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:54,590
Speaker 0: Everything was done in hardware.

633
00:37:54,771 --> 00:38:00,330
Speaker 0: He moved the complicated bits into software now put an IC on this on this board.

634
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:05,338
Speaker 1: I just want to point out that similar things were done later to Dramatically opposite effect.

635
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:06,850
Speaker 1: remember the wind tell modems, right?

636
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,570
Speaker 0: And this is why like the Apple to like there are other computers that have floppy disk drives.

637
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:20,184
Speaker 0: but the Apple to was like the first time where like everyone could have a floppy disk drive and have a bunch of floppy disk because The board that the floppy drive was actually, you know usable and cheap enough.

638
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,190
Speaker 0: right the controller boards were cheap enough.

639
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:29,849
Speaker 0: So but the problem was they had this thing, but they needed like they didn't need an OS But they needed like a file system kind of control.

640
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,669
Speaker 0: You know, there's some sort of disk operating system some way to actually use floppy disk All right to make files to read and write from them.

641
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,033
Speaker 0: And that didn't exist.

642
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:39,556
Speaker 0: So actually no one at Apple wrote that.

643
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:47,080
Speaker 0: I found out from this article here that They hired someone to do that from like another company in the same like, you know a little campus whatever.

644
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:51,080
Speaker 0: And that was the Apple to disk operating system.

645
00:38:51,120 --> 00:39:00,157
Speaker 0: And if you've ever put like an Apple to game on a floppy disk into an Apple to and turn it on It'll say like Apple to DOS version something something and then the game will start.

646
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:02,626
Speaker 0: Yep, right And that's.

647
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,180
Speaker 0: it's not really an operating system.

648
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,498
Speaker 0: It's just really like a disk controlling kind of thing.

649
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:11,659
Speaker 0: But it also like has a basic interpreter and stuff like that and lets you read and write files and whatever.

650
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:20,160
Speaker 0: and Finally the listing for that disk operating system is now publicly available for non-commercial use.

651
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,539
Speaker 0: You can read it yourself.

652
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:26,600
Speaker 0: And what's really fascinating is I've always wondered this like how did they write this to begin with?

653
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,100
Speaker 0: It's like I can use an Apple to writing in basic once the disk operating system is loaded.

654
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:37,486
Speaker 0: I don't wouldn't know how to write at least without a lot of help something like on a Blank Apple to like.

655
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:41,189
Speaker 0: I don't know how to interface with that at all like an assembly like, okay I wrote.

656
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,899
Speaker 1: what do you try?

657
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,571
Speaker 0: It's like I wrote some assembly for Apple to.

658
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,840
Speaker 0: how do I assemble it and get the Apple to to run it?

659
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,780
Speaker 0: I have no fucking clue.

660
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:56,160
Speaker 0: Apparently what they did Is they did it on a different computer with like punch cards?

661
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,499
Speaker 0: Right, and then that computer asset did the assembly the Apple to couldn't assemble its own assembly, huh?

662
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:13,920
Speaker 0: Right, they assembled it on a different more powerful computer and then print it out like I just you know You know a long tape right and then we're able to load it on the Apple to nice.

663
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:19,435
Speaker 0: So here's the listing for that assembly that you have to assemble on a different not all man.

664
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:20,578
Speaker 1: It's just PDF here.

665
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:22,143
Speaker 0: Oh, man Yeah, check it out.

666
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:24,151
Speaker 0: I mean it was the print.

667
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:24,794
Speaker 0: it's a listing.

668
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:27,196
Speaker 0: It's not the code in a file It's a listing of.

669
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:31,800
Speaker 0: you know Like if they used to do that print out books of code and you would turn from page to page reading the code.

670
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:32,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,043
Speaker 0: So here you go.

672
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,352
Speaker 1: Enjoy in the minute moment.

673
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:37,114
Speaker 1: We were just as thank.

674
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:37,656
Speaker 1: I can't release.

675
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:38,760
Speaker 1: I was at Zenka Khan.

676
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:40,108
Speaker 0: I was wise enough not to go to.

677
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:40,611
Speaker 0: thank God.

678
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:56,629
Speaker 1: I went to the mocha festival Convention is PAX East which is coming up pretty soon a few weekends from April 22nd 23rd 24th on the 24th on Sunday We will be presenting sometime in the afternoon Atari game design and that's one of our panels.

679
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:58,754
Speaker 1: That is definitely not on YouTube anywhere.

680
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,258
Speaker 1: It's also a pretty good panel.

681
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:00,860
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

682
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:04,414
Speaker 1: otherwise, uh, stay tuned for whatever news might come of.

683
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:05,799
Speaker 1: other conventions were involved with.

684
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,672
Speaker 1: and Yeah, the next book a book is Margaret Edwards Oryx and Craig.

685
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,940
Speaker 1: I'm going to start reading it within a week.

686
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:14,079
Speaker 0: I bought a copy already.

687
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:20,480
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish the 12th book of the Wheel of Time because I'm mostly through it and I did start reading it though.

688
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:23,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'll start reading in about a week.

689
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:24,572
Speaker 1: So you got a little bit of buffer.

690
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:34,347
Speaker 0: this Saturday April 9th is Netrunner regional championships in Massachusetts, which I bought a ticket to See if I go there as a who sits.

691
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:40,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in Cambridge and you're like MIT areas So I have at least possible ways of getting there.

692
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,219
Speaker 0: But it'll be weird going to Massachusetts and Boston area like three times in one month.

693
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:49,014
Speaker 0: Anime Boston net runner tournament packs.

694
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:53,880
Speaker 1: It's just like oh my god I once went to London and then went to Hong Kong in a separate trip and then stopped in love.

695
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:59,955
Speaker 0: Is the ninth then there's nothing the weekend after that and then packs is the weekend after that.

696
00:42:00,095 --> 00:42:01,680
Speaker 0: actually I could doable.

697
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll remember packs.

698
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:08,796
Speaker 1: This is not the four-day packs like prime and Sunday is not always super hopping.

699
00:42:08,856 --> 00:42:13,530
Speaker 1: just because you know Boston is not the best venue for the outside of Khan hopping.

700
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,315
Speaker 1: There'll be some hopping Thursday.

701
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:17,280
Speaker 1: day and night is gonna be really hopping.

702
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,820
Speaker 1: So if you want to expand your paxies scenario, you want to get there Thursday like early afternoon?

703
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:31,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm thinking actually I might go Thursday and like Sunday, you know try to go home late Sunday.

704
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:34,944
Speaker 1: I was thinking about that too, but like real late on Sunday I might still take money off work.

705
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,870
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll leave late Sunday.

706
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,040
Speaker 1: But then again, it's nice to just go to bed after a packs.

707
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,662
Speaker 1: We'll see like there's something, you know I go.

708
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:47,520
Speaker 1: I've gone to a lot of conventions where I leave like Night, because I don't want to stay like through the whole thing.

709
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:55,060
Speaker 0: But if it's a big con, especially a con that I do a lot The thing is for the cost of a hotel room, right for much less than the cost of one night in a hotel.

710
00:42:55,301 --> 00:43:05,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could take a cab from the bolt bus to my apartment and luxuriously get home at Sunday Or Scott for the price of another night in the room Which I would never something I would never do.

711
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:10,568
Speaker 1: I could take the Acela home and actually be home like real early like way Earlier than you think.

712
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,739
Speaker 0: it's not gonna save that much time.

713
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,188
Speaker 1: It's gonna cost a lot of money.

714
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:14,154
Speaker 1: compared it doesn't cost.

715
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:15,140
Speaker 1: I take you sell all the time.

716
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:17,634
Speaker 0: I'll probably buy tickets for tonight.

717
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:18,460
Speaker 0: That's like 12 bucks.

718
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:24,051
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy those tonight too, but if I was gonna take the Acela home Yes, so it's gonna hit someone and I'm gonna be home first.

719
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:24,874
Speaker 1: the Acela.

720
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:26,280
Speaker 1: if it hits someone they might not notice.

721
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:28,308
Speaker 0: Oh, it doesn't go that fast.

722
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:29,432
Speaker 0: No, it goes pretty fast.

723
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:33,829
Speaker 0: Not Shinkansen cells been going pretty good Not even 1/5 Shinkansen also Scott.

724
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,242
Speaker 1: It's at least it's the money part of Amtrak.

725
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:38,686
Speaker 1: it's not the Pennsylvania part.

726
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:42,076
Speaker 1: All right, so Scott tells me he's been having trouble with HFS plus.

727
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:43,360
Speaker 0: well, okay.

728
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:52,220
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if people realize this but you know computers have different file systems that they use Right, like all your CD roms have like ISO 96 60 or whatever the fuck it.

729
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, or like in the old days like on Linux.

730
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,623
Speaker 0: It was xt like and all your floppy disk used fat fat 16 and all your USB sticks probably using fat 32.

731
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:01,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is what Windows 98 used.

732
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:13,734
Speaker 1: I'll remember the old days fat 32. and then when people started using, you know A lot of people were afraid to leave fat 32 Because the newer file systems on Windows were not accessible on Linux.

733
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:16,245
Speaker 1: and those grognards they are now They are now.

734
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:17,095
Speaker 1: NTFS just works.

735
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,215
Speaker 0: fine NTFS is what your Windows computer uses and your Linux machines.

736
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:25,700
Speaker 0: you could use anything the fuck you want But you're probably using ext4 if it's modern, which is pretty great.

737
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,354
Speaker 1: I still see a lot of systems that default to ext3 and I don't know why.

738
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:30,740
Speaker 0: well, they're just old.

739
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,104
Speaker 0: Well, it's old kernels.

740
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:34,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's always people in selling like some old version of arch somewhere.

741
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:37,303
Speaker 0: stupid reason arch Usually just the newest.

742
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:40,673
Speaker 0: everything old version from a thing is old version.

743
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:41,957
Speaker 0: It's one of those rolling distros.

744
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:42,399
Speaker 0: Yeah.

745
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:42,820
Speaker 1: Anyway

746
00:44:43,762 --> 00:45:01,815
Speaker 0: Some people use XFS some people use ZFS whatever but max OS X modern a brand new MacBook you buy today from the Apple Store Uses a file system known as HFS plus which is I guess slightly better than HFS and HFS Plus even even the plus one is garbage.

747
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:02,417
Speaker 0: It is like though.

748
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:03,200
Speaker 0: It's worse than fat.

749
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:15,060
Speaker 0: Maybe it's not as worse as fat 32, but it's Like I don't know a lot about HFS cuz I've never really well really I mean there are many problems with it under the hood that like no one cares about or will notice, right?

750
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,875
Speaker 1: Well, yeah I mean I could say this like I used to.

751
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:24,889
Speaker 0: you know It's funny back when I cared a lot like it's not gonna give you the performance or the safety of like ext4 you know and all these kinds of things that no one cares about.

752
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:26,054
Speaker 1: I used to be like.

753
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:35,011
Speaker 0: I really like like when I made a Linux machine like I thought a lot about if you're a Linux user and you're not just doing defaults using ext4 for everything You have to think about file systems you like, you know what.

754
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:37,725
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put all these giant videos on this drive So I'll use XFS.

755
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:40,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I have to think about like what my block size is gonna be and stuff, right?

756
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,243
Speaker 0: You know, whatever.

757
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know you and you you thought it mattered.

758
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,367
Speaker 1: It usually didn't actually matter that much.

759
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:58,318
Speaker 0: the main problem with HFS plus is that it is not Case sensitive which means if you go to a directory and you make a file like readme.txt All lowercase readme.txt and you make another file all uppercase readme.txt.

760
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:05,760
Speaker 0: Those are actually the same file on Every other file system that I've ever used that I. as far as I can remember.

761
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:07,551
Speaker 0: That is not the case, right?

762
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:23,560
Speaker 0: If I go to my Windows machine I can make a file that's Scott.txt with a capital S or internet.txt with a capital I and a totally separate file internet.txt with a lowercase I and those will be two Separate files that are not the same file in any way, which is pretty important.

763
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Speaker 0: Like when you're programming something right, you know If you're programming file names into your code or in your settings for your you know Code's gonna use you gotta put file names in there, right and they got to be the right file name.

764
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,589
Speaker 0: Otherwise the wrong file is gonna get opened.

765
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:40,837
Speaker 0: if there's two different files with you know Only thing differentiating their names being the case of the letters in there.

766
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:47,856
Speaker 0: Now the counterpoint I usually see is people arguing that in practice You shouldn't be putting two files in the same directory with the same name.

767
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:48,520
Speaker 0: We're only cases.

768
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:57,788
Speaker 1: if you ever have a file called internet.txt with a lowercase I and Uppercase I and they're in the same directory fucked up.

769
00:46:57,929 --> 00:46:58,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, you there's.

770
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:01,179
Speaker 1: there is a deep problem with you.

771
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:03,005
Speaker 0: Maybe that's the case.

772
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:10,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was always the argument that they would assume that Users of computers would never want to do something like that.

773
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:18,617
Speaker 1: So if you put if you have a bunch of characters that are a file name They assume that if you use a similar set of characters that differs only in case you meant that file.

774
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:19,500
Speaker 0: Well, that's bullshit.

775
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,547
Speaker 0: Everything should be case-sensitive pretty much always.

776
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:27,787
Speaker 1: Actually I haven't thought about this a lot because I explicit is always better than implicit true but I have all I've.

777
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:34,032
Speaker 1: I always think about this in terms of applications and keys and databases and that kind of stuff.

778
00:47:34,072 --> 00:47:41,322
Speaker 1: but here the fat fat 32 NTFS, HFS plus all case insensitive Apparently.

779
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:42,165
Speaker 1: and what?

780
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:51,153
Speaker 1: apparently NTFS if you mount it in Unix is case sensitive Yes, but it's not case sensitive normally anyway.

781
00:47:51,254 --> 00:47:52,958
Speaker 1: interesting yeah, I did some.

782
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:59,780
Speaker 1: I just I found a Wikipedia article and I found some links that are telling me things I didn't know about NTFS.

783
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,904
Speaker 1: So I got distracted right?

784
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:04,800
Speaker 0: So the major problem here is that let's say somebody is working on a Mac.

785
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:17,400
Speaker 0: They're you know developer at my work, right and they're writing some JavaScript or something, right and in their JavaScript code They write something like include my file dot JS and they in their code They write like all lowercase my file dot JS.

786
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:24,059
Speaker 0: But actually when they make the file they make it like my file dot JS or some camel case uppercase M uppercase F.

787
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:32,040
Speaker 1: See now I would already feel not talking about specific technology that if I'm referring to a name of a library It should never be case sensitive, right?

788
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,119
Speaker 0: But so on their computer that totally works.

789
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:36,063
Speaker 0: Right, they?

790
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:41,060
Speaker 0: because my file dot JS is my file dot JS on a Mac with HFS plus.

791
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:46,556
Speaker 0: And then you give that code to someone else to run on this Linux server in production.

792
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:47,940
Speaker 0: and what happens?

793
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:51,500
Speaker 0: File not found my file dot JS no such file.

794
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,417
Speaker 1: Wait HFS plus is listed as both case sensitive and case insensitive.

795
00:48:55,437 --> 00:49:04,540
Speaker 0: That is correct because in fact if you are extremely wise You can actually flip a little blip and make it case sensitive and fix everything.

796
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,827
Speaker 1: However, however, does that break other things?

797
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:08,592
Speaker 0: it breaks two things.

798
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:15,813
Speaker 0: number one every single OS X Application that you try to use that is because the default is case insensitive.

799
00:49:16,214 --> 00:49:23,780
Speaker 0: every OS X application that you try to use That is basically not ever thinking that the file system will be case sensitive is now going to break.

800
00:49:24,142 --> 00:49:29,179
Speaker 0: So anything that's not coded extremely well For your Mac will just not work.

801
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:31,246
Speaker 0: So good luck changing that setting.

802
00:49:31,387 --> 00:49:37,208
Speaker 1: in any realistic scenario where you actually want to run software, right riser I forgot about that didn't kill his wife or something.

803
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:38,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, something weird.

804
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,337
Speaker 0: don't use that.

805
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:39,860
Speaker 0: It's dead.

806
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:49,340
Speaker 0: Because so whoever the other problem being Yeah, try to flip that before like before OS X installs and rewrites.

807
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:51,487
Speaker 0: It's like you can't flip the switch early enough.

808
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:58,932
Speaker 0: by the time you flip the switch OS X is already installed and all these case insensitive files are already there at least if that were an option in Unix.

809
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:02,917
Speaker 1: like you have full control like you can bootstrap your own Stupid system if you want, right?

810
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm not sure exactly how.

811
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:08,600
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can flip it after the fact somehow but good luck with that.

812
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,026
Speaker 1: So you want to have some extra fun this.

813
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:14,608
Speaker 1: I think I mentioned this once the gig nights before but this is I don't even know What would happen in the file system?

814
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:15,797
Speaker 1: So what if I in HFS?

815
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,581
Speaker 1: Made a file that used the Turkish I instead of a normal I?

816
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:25,779
Speaker 0: yeah Unicode is another big reason that we shouldn't make things case insensitive, right?

817
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:32,020
Speaker 0: You know, actually if you make so you make uppercase I and lowercase I are just two different Unicode characters.

818
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,045
Speaker 0: What's what's uppercase?

819
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:38,200
Speaker 0: There's no such thing right from the perspective of bits in a file name But there's a bunch of different uppercase.

820
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:43,498
Speaker 1: So if I write code in Turkish, will it now not work if the libraries are named?

821
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:44,240
Speaker 0: this is what I'm saying.

822
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,600
Speaker 0: What is uppercase and lowercase is from a computer's perspective, right?

823
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,940
Speaker 0: It's you're basically just saying apply this flag to any of these Unicode characters and they map to these other Unicode characters.

824
00:50:55,302 --> 00:51:03,240
Speaker 0: so for the purposes of looking at file names only Consider these 26 Unicode characters to be the same as these other 26 Unicode characters.

825
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:08,838
Speaker 0: All of the Unicode characters are unique except these 26 are the same as those 26 with a one-to-one mapping.

826
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,655
Speaker 0: and it's like Why are you putting that nonsense exception in there?

827
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:12,320
Speaker 0: Just make it wait.

828
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,952
Speaker 0: No file name is a string of Unicode characters that are unique.

829
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:15,112
Speaker 0: the.

830
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:16,800
Speaker 1: my file name has an uppercase one.

831
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,852
Speaker 1: So I guess the exclamation point right exactly, right?

832
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:20,495
Speaker 0: You wouldn't do that.

833
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,640
Speaker 0: That's nonsense, right?

834
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:29,500
Speaker 1: but at the same time so alright if because if you're doing the uppercase lowercase thing then again the Turkish I The dot I and not dot I are different.

835
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:33,080
Speaker 1: So if I uppercase a dot I it's an uppercase I with a dot on it.

836
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,740
Speaker 0: I mean of all people Linus Torvalds has like you can find he has many rants, right?

837
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,864
Speaker 0: he has a rant about this.

838
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:53,246
Speaker 0: basically talking about HFS plus is the worst piece of garbage on earth and As is often the case when he gives these kinds of technological rants He is a mostly right and B half the words are him saying stupid moron stupid You know, so

839
00:51:53,387 --> 00:51:54,735
Speaker 1: I think a little bit of by

840
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:55,259
Speaker 0: cetera, etc.

841
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:56,142
Speaker 1: Suspect.

842
00:51:56,162 --> 00:52:01,560
Speaker 1: there's an interesting the the tone of the words in the Wikipedia article about HFS plus which I'm looking at.

843
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,839
Speaker 1: Cuz I don't know a lot about HFS.

844
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,023
Speaker 0: Let's see who wrote quotes.

845
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:13,371
Speaker 1: due to the age of HFS plus several features that are currently considered staples of modern file systems Like ZFS or riser FS are not present.

846
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:14,637
Speaker 0: That's true, which is true.

847
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:17,224
Speaker 0: Apparently Plus is a garbage.

848
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:19,690
Speaker 1: Let's see nanosecond timestamps are not there.

849
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:26,146
Speaker 1: Nope, which actually could be a problem actually like Concurrent access.

850
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:28,700
Speaker 1: It's basically an old file check summing snap shotting.

851
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:36,811
Speaker 0: Okay, imagine if Windows like barely updated like me instead of making NTFS They had made like fat 64 and then they just stuck with that.

852
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:41,589
Speaker 1: Okay, so real until today It does not have proper hard linking.

853
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,958
Speaker 1: but are there modern use cases for true hard links?

854
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:44,560
Speaker 1: Really?

855
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,133
Speaker 0: Yes, but the point is one.

856
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:49,160
Speaker 0: is that Name one.

857
00:52:49,244 --> 00:52:56,198
Speaker 1: Yeah for a proper like fully compliant hard link like in the b-tree or whatever the file system uses.

858
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:02,180
Speaker 0: because some Application I have a file right and I want to put the file in like someone's home folder for example.

859
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:08,216
Speaker 0: But I also want the file to be in like var Www say for example so that a different application can look at it.

860
00:53:08,236 --> 00:53:13,495
Speaker 0: I don't want to just put a similar Because it may be a sim link isn't gonna work right cuz sim links aren't really.

861
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:30,209
Speaker 0: they're not true links No, but a hard link will totally get the job done, yeah anyway The point is is that there is absolutely no reason I can see why they can't just ship like the next version of OS X with like ext4 or ZFS or any UNIX file.

862
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,631
Speaker 0: It's just you.

863
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:31,655
Speaker 0: OS X is just UNIX.

864
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,040
Speaker 0: You can use any UNIX file system.

865
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:34,646
Speaker 0: It's open source.

866
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:41,757
Speaker 0: There's already a bunch of open source stuff in OS X. It probably would be like minimal labor to just ship OS X well with any

867
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:42,379
Speaker 1: modern file

868
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:49,039
Speaker 0: system Except for the issue of There's probably a lot of software out there that will break when the file system becomes case-sensitive

869
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,740
Speaker 1: Makes it the opposite of a minor problem with trivial effort.

870
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,383
Speaker 0: I think that you just.

871
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:58,263
Speaker 0: you know everyone who has actually has a program that people still use bugs and they'll be done.

872
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:58,564
Speaker 1: so.

873
00:53:58,724 --> 00:54:08,048
Speaker 1: Microsoft developers like dotnet people have to complain forever about the file path file name limitations Even though modern file systems can.

874
00:54:08,128 --> 00:54:18,334
Speaker 1: you can have very very very long paths and file names For all intents and purposes like any software you run in Windows or right in Windows Like you just won't work if your path gets too long.

875
00:54:18,414 --> 00:54:19,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, so shit'll break randomly.

876
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:32,010
Speaker 1: Microsoft has said unequivocally They will never address it because the cost of figuring out all the things that'll break and dealing with that is not worth them even Considering they will never remove that limitation.

877
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:33,094
Speaker 1: Mmm.

878
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:35,060
Speaker 1: So this is probably gonna be in that same boat.

879
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:44,244
Speaker 1: Yeah Until I don't know until I guess until they switch until they pull a Windows and switch from you know HFS to some fundamentally different You know.

880
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:50,240
Speaker 0: First of all, you could do it in iOS because right it doesn't even matter in iOS is no file.

881
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,320
Speaker 1: They could make their own custom file system that had a way to handle legacy application.

882
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,445
Speaker 0: Why write a file system?

883
00:54:55,485 --> 00:54:58,136
Speaker 0: someone already wrote like the best file systems ever for free.

884
00:54:58,277 --> 00:54:59,000
Speaker 0: Why would you write one?

885
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:00,347
Speaker 0: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

886
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:02,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll take it and fork it or something nonsense like that.

887
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:10,755
Speaker 1: That's like I mean I'm saying what I think is gonna happen is The people who care about this will be mad and nothing will not change in the foreseeable future.

888
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,360
Speaker 0: No, well, nothing's it change.

889
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just saying is that this is a thing.

890
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:20,896
Speaker 0: That's a big problem that people don't even know and The only people argue that file system should be case insensitive are bad.

891
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:26,059
Speaker 1: And now you can argue that like certain key lines line is terrible.

892
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,147
Speaker 0: to say They're stupid.

893
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:33,494
Speaker 1: a key field in a database You might want to make case insensitive and you might have a good reason for that But that's not a file system.

894
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:40,660
Speaker 1: file systems Like the underlying infrastructure of your storage that is you don't want to have implicit assumptions about that.

895
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,160
Speaker 0: The only times you want things to be case insensitive is like up at the user interface level like someone searches for like dog.

896
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:51,348
Speaker 0: it's like yeah, you want to return results if someone typed it if the you know, The article has a capital dog or like.

897
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:54,080
Speaker 0: say you have a system below the user interface level.

898
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:55,003
Speaker 0: You don't.

899
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:59,538
Speaker 0: you want case sensitivity perfectly for everything because that's computers dealing with that.

900
00:55:59,558 --> 00:55:59,940
Speaker 0: They need to be.

901
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:03,852
Speaker 1: Also anything that's human readable shouldn't be your key.

902
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:07,183
Speaker 1: your key should be some UID or some nonsense on the back end Like it's not you.

903
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:10,016
Speaker 1: So yeah, like say you want to make a report your system.

904
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:10,720
Speaker 1: you're writing reports.

905
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:12,889
Speaker 1: No one wants to name a report.

906
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:15,460
Speaker 1: internet with an uppercase I and internet with the lower case on.

907
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,670
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

926
00:57:55,485 --> 00:58:04,420
Speaker 1: and I will point out there is a surprising number of additional people who Choose not to have their name read at the end, but are donating above that threshold.

927
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:05,731
Speaker 1: More than one.

928
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:08,939
Speaker 1: who is donating 666 which I think is funny.

929
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:13,092
Speaker 1: But yes, we're back from Zek icon back from anime Boston.

930
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:15,118
Speaker 1: we got a few weeks before PAX East.

931
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:20,080
Speaker 1: so The patreon content is going to expand mightily the next few weeks.

932
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:37,578
Speaker 1: And I've decided because at least as I look right now if you look at the front-end number We're just shy of that first stretch goal of me remastering and re-releasing well, I guess releasing all of the Pre-geek nights launch beta episode some of which none of you have ever heard.

933
00:58:37,638 --> 00:58:47,340
Speaker 1: for sure most of you never heard them, but I think what I'll do because The actual amount of money you're pledging is well above what that threshold was set to.

934
00:58:47,761 --> 00:58:51,700
Speaker 1: It's just that kick patreon changed the way they count the submission money and everything.

935
00:58:52,402 --> 00:59:00,706
Speaker 1: I think I'm just gonna take the first ever episode of geek nights the one we did as a test the first time we ever Did anything before.

936
00:59:00,726 --> 00:59:03,500
Speaker 1: we did real geek nights with the Logitech stick microphone?

937
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:13,180
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take that remaster it and put it up on the patreon for you guys to hear and I'm sure I'll have some interesting commentary once I listen to that, so I'm gonna do that this week.

938
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:17,299
Speaker 1: And now I leave you with something kind of weird.

939
00:59:18,202 --> 00:59:21,954
Speaker 1: Then he waddled away waddle waddle till the very next day.

940
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:23,680
Speaker 1: bum bum bum bum bum bum.

941
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:35,210
Speaker 1: When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand and he said to the man run in the stand hey Bum-bum-bum got any grapes The man said no.

942
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:38,206
Speaker 1: like I said yesterday We just sell lemonade.

943
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:40,073
Speaker 1: okay, why not give it a try?

944
00:59:41,016 --> 00:59:42,180
Speaker 1: the duck said goodbye.

945
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,948
Speaker 1: Then he waddled away waddle waddle.

946
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,556
Speaker 1: then he waddled away waddle waddle.

947
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:49,820
Speaker 1: then he waddled away.

948
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,551
