1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,452
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday November 29th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:16,820
Speaker 0: We talk about Carcassonne and Hellas.

3
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:25,810
Speaker 0: You're gonna lay off on the legacy of Amadeus.

4
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:27,794
Speaker 1: No, cuz it's it's.

5
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:28,937
Speaker 1: it's our current shtick.

6
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:29,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,264
Speaker 0: Yeah for anyone who doesn't know us.

8
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:42,418
Speaker 0: It's real easy for us to get shticks and Let's just say if you ever watch Big O The end of every episode they pick up a phone and a guy with a funny voice says some funny words and We'll leave it at that.

9
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:43,489
Speaker 0: All right.

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:50,870
Speaker 0: So, uh at work today The one guy there's one guy at work who has a kid who's kind of cool the kids into animes into gaming.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:59,626
Speaker 0: So I'm trying to kind of steer him toward the proper geekeries and good works and away from the bad geekeries and the MMOs and everything better than no geekeries at all.

12
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:06,030
Speaker 0: and He doesn't want an Xbox 360 because they're a lot of money, but he wants an Xbox because he can get them cheap.

13
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:17,567
Speaker 0: So he had a friend who got an Xbox 360 the whole deal and the kid offered to sell him his current Xbox and a Bunch of games and controllers for like 75 bucks though the normal Xbox.

14
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:19,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay I was kind of cuz.

15
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,208
Speaker 1: it seemed people aren't even calling cuz.

16
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:25,563
Speaker 1: 360 is so many words that like people are just saying Xbox.

17
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:26,285
Speaker 0: So am I?

18
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,709
Speaker 1: yeah, so it's like.

19
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:33,658
Speaker 1: so I don't we call the old one like Old Xbox and Xbox or just 360 without saying Xbox 360. that could do it.

20
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway, he had a old Xbox and he was gonna sell it to this kid for 75 bucks and he did so All right, which is fantastic.

21
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,242
Speaker 0: Not bad two hours later.

22
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:51,026
Speaker 0: He wanted back out of the deal And he wanted his old crappy Xbox back.

23
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:51,570
Speaker 0: really bad.

24
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:53,288
Speaker 1: Why is that?

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,130
Speaker 0: Apparently his new Xbox 360 Crashes if you play it for more than 20 minutes, maybe he should lift his power supply off the ground with the string.

26
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:08,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gave him some advice and part of that advice was uh, make a giant heatsink and such.

27
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why if it's if this power strip is heating like this.

28
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:13,370
Speaker 0: Did Microsoft not test it?

29
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:20,744
Speaker 1: I think that some of them are bad and some of them are good But why don't they put a fan in it?

30
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:23,355
Speaker 0: there's already fans Arts in it.

31
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,642
Speaker 0: Remember it's a wall wart.

32
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,882
Speaker 1: It just happens to be very big I know but there are fans and everything else.

33
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:31,260
Speaker 0: put fans in that too Because it's already too loud.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,890
Speaker 0: People are already complaining about the loudness.

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,210
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if the loud if you're already loud being louder doesn't hurt you.

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,958
Speaker 0: You're not allowed people.

37
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,740
Speaker 0: people put it they plug it in it's loud So they put it in there like stereo cabinets.

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,785
Speaker 0: They don't have to hear it anymore.

39
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:47,274
Speaker 1: then it overheats Tada.

40
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:56,675
Speaker 0: so, uh Microsoft if you're listening good game good game In Good computer news.

41
00:02:57,116 --> 00:03:01,530
Speaker 1: Oh Firefox one and a half final came out today.

42
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:11,650
Speaker 1: I've been using the beta for a while and Whenever they upgrade Firefox, it always amazes me what they add because I always can't imagine more.

43
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:21,699
Speaker 1: It was a point at which when I was using Firefox point five I was like, you know, it'd really be good if they added this or this or this and They added that and that and that almost right away.

44
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,242
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

45
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:25,928
Speaker 1: And by the time point nine was out I was like, what can they possibly add now?

46
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,294
Speaker 1: this there's nothing else.

47
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,198
Speaker 1: I was perfect.

48
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:37,018
Speaker 1: and then 1.0 they added something and I was like, oh, I guess there was stuff they could add and in 1.5 I couldn't imagine what they were gonna add.

49
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:38,686
Speaker 1: and then I got the beta.

50
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,058
Speaker 1: and well Hey, they amazed me yet again.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,402
Speaker 0: So what did they add?

52
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,131
Speaker 0: Cuz I'm still using a virgin prior to 1.5.

53
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:51,625
Speaker 1: Well, first thing they did is the automatic updates and stuff of extensions and themes and Firefox itself.

54
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:53,370
Speaker 0: it now actually works.

55
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,986
Speaker 0: Ooh as opposed to just downloading an installer and then reinstalling.

56
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,076
Speaker 0: Yeah That's already reason enough for me.

57
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,470
Speaker 1: Okay, the back and forward button performance is increased.

58
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:11,633
Speaker 1: Basically, what they do is Firefox sort of caches buffers pre gets whatever is Whatever.

59
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,950
Speaker 1: you would normally see if you clicked back or forward.

60
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,106
Speaker 1: So that way if you click back or forward It's like instant because it already got the page when you were reading the current page.

61
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:19,970
Speaker 0: I like that a lot.

62
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,884
Speaker 1: All right, you can now drag the tabs to the left and to the right to reorder them.

63
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,895
Speaker 0: Ah I'm indifferent to that.

64
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:30,910
Speaker 1: but yeah, there was an extension to do it before but now you can just do it.

65
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:35,366
Speaker 1: So if the tab is like to the left you want it to be to to the right.

66
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:36,309
Speaker 1: you just pick it up move it.

67
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:43,130
Speaker 1: The pop-up blocking is improved to beat the people who got around it just previously recently.

68
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,168
Speaker 0: Haha, even though I've only seen those pop-ups once when I went to a wares site looking for wares.

69
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:56,917
Speaker 1: Yep They have this new clear private data feature where base used to go into the options and you'd click clear history clear cache And there'd be a clear all button.

70
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:59,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they also clear my cookies, which I didn't want it to clear.

71
00:04:59,693 --> 00:04:59,970
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

72
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:12,991
Speaker 1: But now there's a thing you can set up where you say you basically say if I click clear private data Clear the following things location bar you choose which things you want to be cleared and then you just click that button to clear those Things.

73
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:21,890
Speaker 0: that's real good for if you say you're in college and your mom you visit you fairly often and needs to use your Firefox Just go clear and it clears up the porn so she doesn't see the yeah porn, right?

74
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,410
Speaker 0: God dolphins.

75
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:31,370
Speaker 1: They added answers calm to the search engine list Which I guess you can add anything you want to that search engine list.

76
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,367
Speaker 1: In fact, there's like hundreds and hundreds of things you can add.

77
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:47,170
Speaker 0: in fact IBM did something kind of cool and they made they set up a thing Internally where you can makes it real easy for people who don't know anything about Firefox to add a internal IBM search thing.

78
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:53,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I all once made a search thing for that corner, but it was for OED So only people with names and passwords could use it.

79
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's not so useful to me anymore.

80
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, I use dictionary calm when I need something.

81
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:04,430
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, so you remember how it used to be in Firefox and you got an error that it would pop up a little window.

82
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,277
Speaker 0: I Used to turn that off all the time.

83
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:09,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would have to do some stuff to make it do in a web page.

84
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, all you had to do was change one setting in prefs.js right?

85
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:20,482
Speaker 1: Well now not only is that setting I guess set by default good But now the site the little error pages that you get are actually good.

86
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:21,345
Speaker 1: They're not.

87
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:22,570
Speaker 1: they're not that ugly poop.

88
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,199
Speaker 0: Not bad.

89
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,630
Speaker 1: All right There's a safe mode in case you screw it up with a bad extension.

90
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,980
Speaker 0: That's good because I've been installing Firefox on a lot of servers lately.

91
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,150
Speaker 1: The options menu is redesigned yet again slightly.

92
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,146
Speaker 1: RSS discovery works a little better.

93
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:49,950
Speaker 1: There is now better accessibility for blind people deaf people all that kind of stuff, you know Braille stuff whatnot?

94
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,390
Speaker 1: There's a wizard for reporting a broken website.

95
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,110
Speaker 1: So if you find a website that doesn't work in Firefox, you just click report and then the Firefox guys find out about it.

96
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,334
Speaker 0: That's fantastic.

97
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:01,655
Speaker 1: Yep.

98
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:03,722
Speaker 1: The OS X is improved a little bit.

99
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:21,690
Speaker 1: So you won't be screwed you know, it's so it competes with Safari better basically and It now supports SVG which you used to have to install something to support CSS to CSS 3 JavaScript 1.6 and a bunch of security fixes

100
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,952
Speaker 0: Obstanding

101
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:27,807
Speaker 1: that the CSS 3 is really important because now you can use these little canvases and things.

102
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:33,096
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool You know fast someone already made Quake in a canvas.

103
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:35,104
Speaker 1: So basically it's quake in JavaScript.

104
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:35,887
Speaker 0: Oh great.

105
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:40,522
Speaker 0: Yeah See unless you're really really like opera for some reason.

106
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:43,090
Speaker 0: There's really no reason to not use Firefox at this point.

107
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,419
Speaker 1: Well fire opera is free now though.

108
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't have ads anymore.

109
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:51,227
Speaker 0: So If you like opera I gotta admit opera is a little faster than Firefox in the loading of pages.

110
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:55,499
Speaker 1: a little faster I don't you know, but it's just crook slightly different.

111
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

112
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,669
Speaker 0: There's no excuse to use IE anymore and None at all.

113
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,604
Speaker 0: I I know most of our listeners don't need to know this and they don't need to hear this.

114
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:13,163
Speaker 0: but to those of you and I'm pointing this specifically at two people who have mentioned specifically that they still use IE Stop using it.

115
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:16,680
Speaker 0: You Know they never patched that thing.

116
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,832
Speaker 1: I told everyone about yeah I mean seriously if there's a guy in the corner giving out free I don't know.

117
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:30,582
Speaker 1: Ferraris right and you have a Pinto and you know, it explodes But you're just used to driving the Pinto.

118
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,109
Speaker 1: Why what the hell's wrong with you?

119
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,412
Speaker 0: I mean serious.

120
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,477
Speaker 0: seriously a couple lines of JavaScript.

121
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,110
Speaker 0: I could put it on our podcast site and I'd get control over your computer.

122
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,557
Speaker 0: Yep, I can just JavaScript.

123
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:51,050
Speaker 0: you don't have to do anything just visit the site and then we've got you and you know What this JavaScript is all over the internet and Microsoft hasn't even really figured out how to fix it yet.

124
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,302
Speaker 1: and basically anyone who wants to can just stick this on their website.

125
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:57,573
Speaker 1: and if you visit using IE You're pooned.

126
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:02,350
Speaker 0: and I know some people say oh well Firefox has exploits too and blah blah blah blah.

127
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,342
Speaker 0: And as it gets more popular to have more but one not really.

128
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,051
Speaker 0: it's had a handful and they were all patched within 24.

129
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,007
Speaker 0: I think the longest time it ever took for a patch to come out was like 30 hours.

130
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,402
Speaker 1: That was one that took a couple days, but it wasn't a serious like, you know end of the world I can take over your computer.

131
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:22,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, the worst Can do is take over your Firefox.

132
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,290
Speaker 1: No one can take over your computer with a Firefox hole.

133
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can take over your computer with an IE hole.

134
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:34,088
Speaker 0: in fact trivially I could probably I could tell you right now exactly what JavaScript to type to do it.

135
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,115
Speaker 0: Yep I'm not going to.

136
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:59,400
Speaker 1: there was actually an interesting discussion the other day about people were talking about Firefox's market share and it's about 10% a little less maybe right in terms of number of people but what they What they were saying is that they don't think that that information that statistic even if it's accurate is really Relevant or important because the people who use IE Aren't people who visit lots and lots of websites.

137
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:12,745
Speaker 1: so the people who maybe sign on visit website sign off Anyone who actually visits websites and goes around the web and does web things in a daily basis or a frequent basis they all most of them use Firefox at least 90% of those types of people.

138
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:28,970
Speaker 1: because if you go to websites that are the kind of websites that only nerdy website internet savvy people use like a delicious or Blah or like nerdy blogs or super podcasts most of the visitors are Firefox by a wide margin.

139
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:36,644
Speaker 1: Yep, so if you're not using Firefox You're really like all the smart people use it.

140
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:40,461
Speaker 1: There's a reason all this money Seriously, they went through effort to switch to it.

141
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:48,449
Speaker 0: I look at the statistics on our Site through the feeds and there is one person using Internet Explorer that I can see.

142
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,564
Speaker 0: Awesome one, you know who you are.

143
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:52,308
Speaker 0: Stop it.

144
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 0: All right, not to be mean but it's bad for you.

145
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna tell you to do something because You know, we have some evil agenda.

146
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,442
Speaker 1: I mean what the hell do we gain?

147
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just your loss that we're trying to prevent.

148
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:13,936
Speaker 0: Hey, so segue Segue into thing of the day.

149
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:18,520
Speaker 1: the thing thing thing thing and not the guy who's made of rock on the Fantastic Four.

150
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:20,624
Speaker 0: That was really bad.

151
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:21,086
Speaker 0: Shut up.

152
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's the thing of the day.

153
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:26,668
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah is better Do more.

154
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:35,223
Speaker 0: All right, so, uh Technology to keep kids off my damn lawn has grown a little bit Really?

155
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:40,960
Speaker 0: There's this old codger and it's in Britain and he doesn't like the fact that punk kids hang out in front of his shop.

156
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,120
Speaker 1: You know if I had a shop I wouldn't want punk kids loitering in front of it either.

157
00:11:45,381 --> 00:12:01,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he realized and this isn't really science But it's kind of true in a general sense that generally older people There cannot hear certain frequencies that younger people can because younger people haven't been to as many concerts plain and simple.

158
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:15,091
Speaker 0: So he made a little device that makes really annoying high-pitched noises like remember when you were in high school and Like the TV in the corner would be on and everyone in the class could hear it and they're like ah But the professor the teacher didn't hear anything.

159
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:15,895
Speaker 0: Yep.

160
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:16,599
Speaker 0: It's like that.

161
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:28,091
Speaker 0: so he has this making this noise outside of the front of his store and Teenagers and punk kids hear it, but all the adult customers who come in don't The dogs be pretty pissed.

162
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,178
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah dogs hate it.

163
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have if you run a pet shop, you don't want to use this.

164
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:37,000
Speaker 1: No, so we should go hang out in front of the swing in his pet shop in town.

165
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Speaker 0: So I thought while it's kind of blah it's I got to admit for a guy who doesn't seem to know much about science It's a pretty novel solution to his problem and I applaud him for that.

166
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:51,578
Speaker 1: I wonder if it'll work though.

167
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:58,140
Speaker 0: Well, there were places in Britain earlier that were started playing classical music in order to keep kids from hanging out.

168
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:58,843
Speaker 1: Did it work?

169
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,094
Speaker 0: Not really kids like classical music.

170
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:01,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too

171
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:18,399
Speaker 0: but the only thing wrong with this is that the guy seems to think he got on this kick when he Reporters interviewed him and he was talking about how we'd like to make a stronger one that could be used against this process or this method of thievery called streaming that apparently happens in Britain.

172
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,550
Speaker 1: Streaming streaming like streaming video.

173
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,039
Speaker 0: Yeah only streaming shoplifting instead.

174
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:39,160
Speaker 0: imagine you're you're in a little shop and you're standing there and Suddenly like 15 to 20 like young teenage punks run into your store Start smashing things and grabbing everything they can in a giant mess and then they all run out and scatter.

175
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:47,837
Speaker 1: So while they ran in it first of all, so if this happened more than once I would have heard about it Unless I was the first victim in which case I'm the first victim.

176
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:48,179
Speaker 1: Oh, well

177
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:48,763
Speaker 0: Yeah,

178
00:13:49,125 --> 00:14:04,719
Speaker 1: if I'd heard about it as soon as those guys came into my store It took me about the second to realize what was happening and I'd lock the door and they'd be stuck in my store and then I would have a shotgun and Then anyone who tried to walk out of the store with stuff would die.

179
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:11,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, or I would fill them with rock salt Which would be okay probably.

180
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,120
Speaker 0: now the guy seems to think that he made a stronger version.

181
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:20,998
Speaker 0: He could stun all these kids when this happens and prevent the theft maybe with an L rad not with one of these.

182
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,865
Speaker 1: no Definitely not with one.

183
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,236
Speaker 0: still I thought it was cool and it was a slow news day.

184
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:27,364
Speaker 0: So that's all I got All right.

185
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:29,311
Speaker 1: So do you remember back in the day?

186
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:39,538
Speaker 1: There was this thing called master maze, which was Basically you paid 50 bucks and you got this big heavy box with this metal already painted modular dungeons.

187
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,536
Speaker 1: Oh And you could make a dungeon for D&D by putting these pieces together and it would be nice.

188
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,920
Speaker 1: and 3d it had walls.

189
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:47,745
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

190
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:48,710
Speaker 0: It was just really really.

191
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,420
Speaker 1: it was awesome, but really expensive.

192
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,540
Speaker 1: But it had nice little you know, one inch squares and everything and it was really cool.

193
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,350
Speaker 1: You can make dungeons with opening doors and treasures and everything wicked cool.

194
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:02,360
Speaker 1: Well some guy took it to the next level.

195
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:18,112
Speaker 1: what he did is he made a Brand new role-playing game system and this system Depends on something quite like the master maze Only and here's where the geekiness factor doubles and triples.

196
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:22,058
Speaker 1: It is implemented with 100% Lego.

197
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:26,170
Speaker 0: Wow, wouldn't that almost be more expensive?

198
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:27,654
Speaker 1: I think it would.

199
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:28,357
Speaker 1: but he's got.

200
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,388
Speaker 1: he's got Rules for a system.

201
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,240
Speaker 1: He's got little guys for each class.

202
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:40,926
Speaker 1: He's got modular dungeons made of Lego like monsters Character sheets the whole thing.

203
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:51,340
Speaker 0: It's it's an RPG that you play on the table with Legos to represent your guys, you know, not only is that badass, but I probably have enough Legos in my collection to do it.

204
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:53,868
Speaker 1: I bought mostly Castle Lego in my day.

205
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,132
Speaker 1: I got a lot of Castle Lego.

206
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,740
Speaker 0: now see I guess I'm we're old fogies.

207
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,500
Speaker 0: But there when we were kids you could buy buckets of generic Lego pieces for almost nothing.

208
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,016
Speaker 1: It wasn't almost nothing.

209
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:06,320
Speaker 1: there was.

210
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,628
Speaker 0: We were like five Yeah, because Lego almost went out of business.

211
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,855
Speaker 0: Well, I think they almost did.

212
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,760
Speaker 0: they had a lot of trouble not that long ago.

213
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:23,260
Speaker 0: The problem with Lego was that Lego bricks are incredibly durable and it's almost impossible to destroy them.

214
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:31,140
Speaker 0: so as They sold more and more Legos the demand for Lego drops because parents people would pass them on to kids.

215
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:33,751
Speaker 0: people would sell them on a well not on eBay.

216
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:40,819
Speaker 0: back then if you would sell them and trade them and Once you had a certain amount of Legos, you didn't need any more Unless you're not like this guy.

217
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,009
Speaker 1: Yeah.

218
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,243
Speaker 0: so they started.

219
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:52,720
Speaker 0: they cut back on selling generic pieces and they made their sets more expensive and they added a lot of Special parts that can't really be used in anything else to try to get people to buy more Legos.

220
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:54,765
Speaker 1: Legos are still cool.

221
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,830
Speaker 1: They didn't go too far.

222
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,940
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not claiming they're not even went a little farther.

223
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,984
Speaker 1: They would be over the edge.

224
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:03,080
Speaker 0: But yeah, they're a little too pricey now, but I have enough Legos to make a small house.

225
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,118
Speaker 1: So I got plenty of Lego.

226
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,644
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to call Legos.

227
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:10,472
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's Lego Lego Lego.

228
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,160
Speaker 1: Lego is the pearl of Lego Lego my ego.

229
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:14,958
Speaker 0: No, yeah.

230
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:23,031
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you if you like D&D or role-playing games you just get in or Legos Totally got to check this out.

231
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,118
Speaker 1: It's freaking awesome.

232
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:30,025
Speaker 0: It's the main bit the main bit Main the main bit.

233
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,231
Speaker 0: that doesn't have music for the main bit.

234
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,236
Speaker 1: Yeah music real soon.

235
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:35,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're working on it.

236
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:42,496
Speaker 0: so it's a Gaming day and we've got two new games and they're not video games.

237
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:48,500
Speaker 0: Yeah for once So Carcassonne is a really fun game and we've played it a lot.

238
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:49,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

239
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,240
Speaker 1: if you haven't played Carcassonne it's a tile laying game.

240
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,000
Speaker 1: You basically take turns laying tiles and you put guys on the tiles.

241
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:11,440
Speaker 1: You could put them on the grass on the road or in a castle and then you finish the roads with other tiles and you finish the castles with other tiles or You build enough castles in the grassy area and that you have score depending on how well you placed your guys.

242
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:15,100
Speaker 0: It's really quick really fun really simple and it was a good game.

243
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,949
Speaker 1: It's actually so good that it's a German board game.

244
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:19,073
Speaker 1: they got sold at Toys R Us.

245
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:20,740
Speaker 0: so yeah, that's saying a lot.

246
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:26,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, now it's a great game, but there are a million expansions for it and we figured out why.

247
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,999
Speaker 0: Well many reasons why but the base set.

248
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,627
Speaker 0: After you play it a lot and get good at it.

249
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:42,140
Speaker 0: You discover that due to the way the tiles are set up It is very basically it's easier to screw other people than it is to get points for yourself.

250
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:49,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, for example, if someone else is gonna finish a castle for a bunch of points You know that such and such a tile does not exist.

251
00:18:50,123 --> 00:19:00,746
Speaker 1: So you arrange other tiles in such a way So that they need a tile that does not exist in order to complete their castle and thus their castle does not complete and they Don't score points.

252
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:06,656
Speaker 0: and if you're playing this game with you know, five people No one ever finishes anything and it's just a game of who screwed who the most.

253
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,343
Speaker 1: Yep It's that's.

254
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:10,431
Speaker 1: if the people know what's got who know how to play.

255
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,907
Speaker 1: if you play with noobs or if you've never played before This won't happen.

256
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,799
Speaker 1: You'll pretty much play a nice easy game.

257
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:25,052
Speaker 0: So we picked up the hotels and citadels or cathedrals Expansions and it only adds 18 tiles to the game.

258
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,507
Speaker 0: it adds two new kinds of tiles But and they actually add a lot to the game.

259
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,860
Speaker 0: I found I was skeptical at first but they actually make it really interesting.

260
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:37,700
Speaker 0: Yep, but these 18 tiles are all the weird tiles that didn't exist in the other game.

261
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:47,013
Speaker 0: they're all like a city in a city and then like a road coming in in a weird direction or like a City or like four city end caps all around a piece of grass.

262
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:52,575
Speaker 0: now you play this game with like 40 tiles So you wouldn't think adding 18 tiles makes a difference makes a huge difference.

263
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:53,700
Speaker 0: It's a completely different game.

264
00:19:53,862 --> 00:20:01,819
Speaker 0: It's now actually a game of Completing things because every time you think you screwed someone and you walled off their city and they can't find a piece They draw the piece they need like three times.

265
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:21,620
Speaker 1: See the problem was though is without the expansion you end up always needing a tile and then not getting it now with the expansion Not only do you get the tiles you need you get a bunch of really wicked Tiles that you don't need and you have to end up sticking them way off at the edge of the map because you don't have A weird situation to use them in because you filled it up already.

266
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,600
Speaker 0: And I gotta say it's fantastic since there's only two of us.

267
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,759
Speaker 0: We like playing two-player games and there aren't that many good two-player games.

268
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,416
Speaker 0: Carcassonne has been renewed to the point that I think we're gonna play it after we finish the show tonight.

269
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:38,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, it definitely The expansion revived the game, you know, it was it was big.

270
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,540
Speaker 1: then it kind of faded.

271
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,830
Speaker 1: Then we played a little bit then it faded.

272
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,820
Speaker 1: then the expansion has revived it to full.

273
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,169
Speaker 0: I can't wait to play the expansion with more people.

274
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:52,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the thing I think with with more people I think actually all the tiles will get used awesomely.

275
00:20:52,601 --> 00:21:01,700
Speaker 0: yeah, but anyone who tries to go for the size castles we're going for will be unhappy or Multiple people will try to finish castles and then try to edge each other out with a big, dude.

276
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:05,774
Speaker 1: Oh as opposed to where now we try to edge each other out in the farms.

277
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,100
Speaker 1: The farms won't matter so much.

278
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,431
Speaker 1: Yeah going for the big 70-point castle Cathedral whatever is in them.

279
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:20,600
Speaker 1: Also, I used to not pay attention to road so much but now with the inns I keep getting lots of road points.

280
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:26,220
Speaker 0: Yep, but so often you think if you ever play this game, you'll think how could anyone ever screw me on a road?

281
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:29,219
Speaker 0: How could I ever get to the point where I couldn't cap off a road?

282
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,429
Speaker 0: You freaking can't cap off roads because people screw you.

283
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,619
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I won because of it and you won because of it.

284
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:36,989
Speaker 1: It's a good plan.

285
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,367
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing is a lot of the.

286
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:43,295
Speaker 1: there are other carcass own expansions like.

287
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,320
Speaker 0: there's billions of them.

288
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,272
Speaker 1: Well, some of them aren't expansions.

289
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,359
Speaker 1: I actually looked into it.

290
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:56,359
Speaker 1: Yeah Some of them are actually other games and what they did is they rebranded the games as carcass own The castle or carcass own the something else

291
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,306
Speaker 0: Yep, like no dragon and the princess

292
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,060
Speaker 1: so that people who liked carcass own would be more likely to buy this other game.

293
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:07,726
Speaker 1: But some of them are expansions like the dragon and the princess or whatever It's called.

294
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,520
Speaker 1: and there's another one with a little count.

295
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:20,940
Speaker 1: Yeah count Dracula, but not a vampire that goes around the map You know and like the dragon eats your farmer guys and the princess saves them and little witches and fairies and things.

296
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:30,317
Speaker 1: And I don't know if I like those expansions so much but I haven't tried them so I can't say But if this expansion runs dry, I'll definitely be willing to try some more.

297
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:35,700
Speaker 0: Yep So if you ever buy a carcass own just pick up ins and cathedrals, it's definitely worth it.

298
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as for the other games that are labeled carcass own that are actually completely different games.

299
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,160
Speaker 1: Well, they're not completely different.

300
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,060
Speaker 1: They're similar in that they are tile laying games that you place guys on the tiles, you know.

301
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,249
Speaker 1: Which is why they're able to label them carcass own.

302
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,107
Speaker 1: but the ones that aren't actually carcass own I don't know.

303
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:59,680
Speaker 1: I guess you have to look at them individually Maybe what the original games were to figure out if they're good or not.

304
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:06,464
Speaker 0: We also picked up a bunch of other games, but we only played one of them because the rest require More than two people.

305
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,471
Speaker 1: we'll play those by next week.

306
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:08,912
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

307
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they look super awesome.

308
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have to head up to Albany grab some Pete and play some board game.

309
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:15,915
Speaker 1: Well card games.

310
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:20,329
Speaker 1: They're card games other games Games games.

311
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:32,754
Speaker 1: Anyway, the game that we were able to play which is two-player Which I bought because it was two-player and was recommended as a good two-player game is helles H-e-l-l-a-s as in Hellenic culture Greeks.

312
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,260
Speaker 1: It's a big Greek game.

313
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,022
Speaker 1: In fact.

314
00:23:35,344 --> 00:23:36,909
Speaker 1: the names of little guys in the game.

315
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:39,800
Speaker 1: It just says Greeks put your Greek on the island.

316
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:46,257
Speaker 1: It's um, we played it once I won handily.

317
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:55,047
Speaker 1: yeah the game isn't perfect, but it's better than the impression before playing it would.

318
00:23:55,108 --> 00:24:06,829
Speaker 0: yes let you feel because once we played it, it's fun and It looks like once we both get good at it and kind of figure out the strategies and the counters to the strategies It looks like a decent kill some time two-player game.

319
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:07,190
Speaker 0: Yep.

320
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:09,680
Speaker 0: The problem was when we were first reading through the rules.

321
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,020
Speaker 0: It sounds real arbitrary.

322
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:21,140
Speaker 1: It's like you could only have three guys here and you can only have this many this and you can only do This when the moon is in the south.

323
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:27,376
Speaker 0: If there's a squiggly line on the card you can use it sometimes but other times you can't.

324
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:30,605
Speaker 1: and yeah and The rules are in.

325
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:40,800
Speaker 0: they don't have the super preciseness of wording that you know A hundred percent what things do and we actually had to look up errata on one rule because there was no way to know.

326
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,270
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know, sometimes it's a little vague.

327
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,156
Speaker 1: Like can you play god cards now?

328
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,240
Speaker 1: Can you play them now?

329
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:48,565
Speaker 1: Did this one matter?

330
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,469
Speaker 1: Does that one matter?

331
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,855
Speaker 1: Can I go back on that?

332
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:51,658
Speaker 1: What are you know?

333
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:57,508
Speaker 1: And sometimes it feels a little loose like, you know I'm used to having games where the rules are.

334
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,483
Speaker 1: you do this then you do this then you do this and that is the end And you skip this.

335
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:03,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you can just play cards whenever.

336
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:06,789
Speaker 0: yes, like I play a card Yeah, I play a counter spell to that.

337
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,760
Speaker 0: Well, I play a counter spell to your counter spell.

338
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:09,828
Speaker 0: Well, I play a card.

339
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,439
Speaker 0: Let me take my counter spell back and play it again.

340
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:14,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do the same and then I play my original card.

341
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:24,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are cards just flying around Everywhere and it feels kind of willy-nilly which isn't such a good feeling except it isn't actually willy-nilly It's actually precise.

342
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:26,071
Speaker 0: You just have to get over that feeling.

343
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, also if you play the game Scott this is why Scott lost.

344
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:34,477
Speaker 0: he made the mistake of thinking that it was a game of conquer territory.

345
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:35,943
Speaker 0: move your guys around have Strong armies.

346
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 0: It's really a card game and maneuvering game.

347
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Speaker 1: Mmm, the cards pretty much make the whole game because you're only allowed to have three Greeks in a city.

348
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:52,549
Speaker 1: So and you have a limited supply of Greek a very limited supply of Greeks So you basically you must spread the Greeks thin.

349
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:55,540
Speaker 1: so getting new territory is all about cards.

350
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,543
Speaker 1: You can't do.

351
00:25:56,563 --> 00:26:03,989
Speaker 1: basically if you try to do something without cards your chances of succeeding are pretty much nil or a voyaging Which you just never did.

352
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:10,480
Speaker 1: I tried to do voyaging But I always felt so weak that I didn't want to voyage because then I wouldn't reinforce my position.

353
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,869
Speaker 0: The thing is I was equally weak.

354
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,677
Speaker 1: So I realized that You were a little stronger than me though in a lot of places that's cuz.

355
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:21,015
Speaker 0: I'm better stronger braver faster handsomer.

356
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,508
Speaker 1: You want to play it like risk, but you can't.

357
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:29,800
Speaker 1: you just have to try to get more islands and then it's not risk.

358
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:30,763
Speaker 0: Don't think it is.

359
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:31,245
Speaker 0: you lose.

360
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:32,450
Speaker 1: You'll totally lose.

361
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:36,741
Speaker 0: Or unless the other guy also thinks is risk and then no one will ever win There is.

362
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:37,082
Speaker 1: the only.

363
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:51,834
Speaker 1: the one thing though is that because the cards basically make the game is That if you don't get the cards It's like you'll get every card because there's so few but if you don't have the cards you want when you got them when you Want them.

364
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:57,570
Speaker 0: see I think that's yes Cuz I. basically what I did is I drew cards that I didn't want and I didn't get the cards I wanted.

365
00:26:58,112 --> 00:27:04,038
Speaker 0: So what I did is I looked at the cards I had and thought well then I can use these cards to do this and I had to change my strategy constantly.

366
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I tried to use whatever cards I had.

367
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:12,320
Speaker 0: I tried to do something with but a lot of times You gotta save cards don't use a card unless you have to.

368
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,666
Speaker 0: that way when you need a card you got a card.

369
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:20,970
Speaker 0: Yeah The one thing about the game that bugs me is it feels because we said earlier the rules are kind of arbitrary.

370
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:25,730
Speaker 0: It feels like they made this game and they played it and then they realized oh, it's broken.

371
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:26,969
Speaker 0: If you do this you win automatically.

372
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:32,507
Speaker 0: So they made a rule against that and then oh now it's broken this way and they just tacked on rules until the game was balanced.

373
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:34,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does kind of feel like that.

374
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:35,824
Speaker 0: Of course.

375
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,488
Speaker 0: It's balanced.

376
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:43,424
Speaker 0: So Yeah, it's balanced definitely not an A game not an A game but not a C game.

377
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:50,309
Speaker 1: no, oh if you know If I had to take one two-player game with me to the end of the world, this would not be it.

378
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:51,435
Speaker 0: I'd take San Juan.

379
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:57,689
Speaker 1: maybe San Juan, but you know if We're sitting around we want to play a two-player game.

380
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,929
Speaker 1: You got you know, the other games are a little played out.

381
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:02,653
Speaker 1: It's not bad.

382
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:07,830
Speaker 1: if I you know, it would definitely be in I guess some top ten two-player games so far.

383
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:09,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't know so many two-player games.

384
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,990
Speaker 0: I mean technically Tigris and Euphrates is two-player, but it only lasts about three.

385
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,339
Speaker 1: It's not a very good of being a two-player game.

386
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,483
Speaker 0: Shogun is two-player.

387
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:18,226
Speaker 0: So is risk.

388
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, those aren't very good.

389
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,315
Speaker 1: That's like a Lombre.

390
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, you play with Matt Matt.

391
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:28,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, but There are a whole bunch of other two-player games in this series.

392
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:36,376
Speaker 1: they all come in the same little square boxes and they say cosmos on them with a K and One of the other ones is lost cities.

393
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,581
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about gonna try that.

394
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,910
Speaker 1: it's pretty popular and there's some other ones.

395
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:43,578
Speaker 1: So this is just one of the more popular ones in the series.

396
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:46,747
Speaker 1: So I got it tried it not really regretting buying it.

397
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:59,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, so so we like the German board games and So since the college ended there hasn't been too much Opportunity to play them because a lot of them need more than two people.

398
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:02,870
Speaker 0: Granted we've had some crazy weekends of gaming where we played every game.

399
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:17,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, but you know, I've since I left college and got here with the job and everything I've been looking for some people to play with and You know board game geek was the place and I did kind of find some people but you know It never really came together a hundred percent.

400
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:18,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, I missed all this.

401
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:31,920
Speaker 1: I was out of town Yeah, and I heard about a group called maws like month weeks and months ago Maybe even but I could never actually find them because the only way to contact them was old email addresses that weren't used and all Kinds of stuff like that.

402
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:32,950
Speaker 0: Why don't they have a website?

403
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,695
Speaker 1: They're gonna have one soon.

404
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:36,485
Speaker 1: I guess that's least what that was.

405
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,450
Speaker 0: Should we make it for him?

406
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,006
Speaker 1: I mean someone else I think already made it but some people have to look it over.

407
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:41,448
Speaker 1: I don't know.

408
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:41,829
Speaker 1: I don't care.

409
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:46,818
Speaker 1: stand for Mid Hudson area war gamers society.

410
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:56,830
Speaker 0: every game every gamer club like that has a weird name like that because they think this Arweg the Rochester area wargaming guild Rochester war game.

411
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,708
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's because all of these things all the clubs that are still around are the ancient.

412
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:15,770
Speaker 1: They're the really old clubs from like the 70s from when it was war gaming and now that wargaming is left popular They've moved over to the German games and RPGs and CCGs and things.

413
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,764
Speaker 0: Why don't we start our own club with a non stupid name right here in Beacon?

414
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,779
Speaker 1: I Guess the guy who does the board game podcast.

415
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,850
Speaker 1: his his group is the Santa Clarita board gamers.

416
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,359
Speaker 0: We've officially formed a group in Beacon.

417
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:29,002
Speaker 0: There's two of us.

418
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:29,845
Speaker 0: We'll name it later.

419
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:38,555
Speaker 1: I had the beacon board gamers Anyway, so I finally found these guys, you know via someone else posting on board game geek And I was just lucky.

420
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:41,830
Speaker 1: I visited that day because I don't go there that often and I saw the word Poughkeepsie.

421
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,224
Speaker 1: So I went down to the Dragon's Den, which is local game store.

422
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:46,530
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest game store.

423
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:47,476
Speaker 1: It actually moved.

424
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,750
Speaker 1: It's a little better now, but you know, it's alright.

425
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,496
Speaker 1: Went down there played some games.

426
00:30:53,078 --> 00:31:01,649
Speaker 1: The guys are pretty much typical middle-aged gamer guys, you know, they're not very Attractive but you know, they're funny, you know, they don't know how to play games.

427
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:12,896
Speaker 1: it was a good time and If I didn't have anything better to do I wouldn't mind going back playing some more games, you know There was when I first got there.

428
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:17,630
Speaker 1: There was some guys were actually playing a super real war game and I was like, whoa

429
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:23,811
Speaker 0: You mean the kind of game where two guys sit there and like a tank runs into another tank Where

430
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:26,506
Speaker 1: there are little tiny squares of cardboard with numbers and some they

431
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:27,109
Speaker 0: don't roll dice.

432
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:31,992
Speaker 0: They actually sit there with an encyclopedia and they look up the different encyclopedia.

433
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:42,686
Speaker 1: but like they had a map a real kind of somewhat more real map than any kind of game I play and Little things they're like like Oh airplanes and tanks and the names of airplanes.

434
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:43,750
Speaker 0: see those games scare me.

435
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:50,050
Speaker 0: That's the kind of game where you'd look up in a book and then you'd say yeah But this tank in the real world that two-inch armor and therefore the shells couldn't penetrate.

436
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:55,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would say yeah, but a bunch of other guys I think in another table, so I sat down with them.

437
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,890
Speaker 1: one guy was the guy that I spoke to on board game geek.

438
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:03,890
Speaker 1: He was an okay kind of guy, you know, he was a little grumbly took the games like this tiny bit too seriously.

439
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:08,290
Speaker 0: That's tough for us to say because we take our games pretty damn seriously.

440
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:12,868
Speaker 1: It was like he'd be a little grumbly like if you did a move against him, you know and stuff like that.

441
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:13,330
Speaker 1: It was cool.

442
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:18,758
Speaker 1: There was another guy He I didn't know I don't remember anyone's name.

443
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,082
Speaker 1: one guy was Z man.

444
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:22,510
Speaker 1: He actually owned a game company Z man games.

445
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:25,689
Speaker 1: He was an okay guy, but he's a little talk too much a little bit.

446
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:29,764
Speaker 1: You know, I met the owner of dragons den actually right before I left.

447
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:38,550
Speaker 1: He was a cool guy, you know I mean he was trying to push his products Which I guess is understandable and you know kind of puts me off when someone is like that.

448
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:59,590
Speaker 1: But other than that, he seemed like, you know a decent guy looks like a game store owner, you know The game store does sell a lot of paintball airsoft and that seems to be their Biggest moneymaker which is kind of sad You know, but anyway, I also I played a bunch of these simple German type card games that were pretty fun.

449
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,621
Speaker 1: One of them was with these red chips.

450
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:02,667
Speaker 1: It was like a game of chicken.

451
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:03,290
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool.

452
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:13,329
Speaker 0: another one I played was Shit Do I need to add a cue here?

453
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,236
Speaker 1: I remember what the other one was.

454
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,705
Speaker 1: just add the cue and you played some games.

455
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:26,330
Speaker 0: Yeah So, yeah, that's probably our best chance to actually have people to play board games with nowadays.

456
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:30,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, I played one other game that was called Vegas showdown.

457
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:41,189
Speaker 1: It was a game from Hasbro, well, they called it Hasbro Hill, you know Avalon Hill the cut the people label that does like axis and allies and all those things.

458
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:56,605
Speaker 1: and You know, I was kind of iffy on this game with its Vegas theme and such but actually turned out to be a really good Game, you know despite the the Vegas theme like you bid on pieces of a casino And then you build a casino out of them and use the casino chips for money.

459
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,970
Speaker 0: Oh, I like bidding games.

460
00:33:58,713 --> 00:33:59,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

461
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:02,210
Speaker 1: it was actually a much better game than I thought even though I lost horribly.

462
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,018
Speaker 1: Yeah Overall good time.

463
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:06,783
Speaker 0: All right.

464
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:07,790
Speaker 0: There's some geeks out there.

465
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're uh, you know down in the mid Hudson Valley, you

466
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:14,393
Speaker 0: know Hudson River Yeah,

467
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:26,734
Speaker 1: and you're looking for some German type board games or anything like that There's a mailing list and I guess you can get on it by some miracle of finding these guys because they like to hide in The hole somewhere.

00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,907
Speaker 0: Well post whatever links we can come up with whenever we come up with them.

00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:38,717
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'll warn you though.

473
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,429
Speaker 0: Do you play Puerto Rico or tires and Euphrates with us?

474
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,958
Speaker 0: expect to cry.

475
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:49,389
Speaker 1: I Know these guys didn't cry when I played against them, even though I did shut the guy down an external conflict with five blue tiles.

476
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:52,905
Speaker 1: He became after me in this blue external conflict.

477
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,850
Speaker 1: He was so confident He was ahead by five and I was like five blue tiles.

478
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:00,501
Speaker 1: I was just five blue tiles and he was like he was like dying.

479
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:02,266
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah.

480
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:05,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I'm not saying Oh, we're so good blah blah blah.

481
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,237
Speaker 0: I'm saying we're bastards Like most people who seem to play board games.

482
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:11,681
Speaker 0: don't bevagon.

483
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:12,944
Speaker 0: They don't take their turn.

484
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:15,010
Speaker 1: These guys definitely did not take their turn.

485
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:20,278
Speaker 1: I think their turn faster than some people I know But they didn't they're not.

486
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,630
Speaker 1: I took my turn instantly and they did not because board game geek.

487
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:31,109
Speaker 0: I saw a thread where people talking about what do you do when your friends take too long and the Consensus seemed to be that you take no more than a few minutes on your turn?

488
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:42,410
Speaker 1: We take about five seconds and get really pissed if someone takes more than about five seconds, yeah people wonder like They were amazed when I said I played Puerto Rico five times in a day.

489
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,133
Speaker 1: It must take.

490
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:44,960
Speaker 1: that must mean ten hours to them.

491
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:50,301
Speaker 0: It means four hours to me Yeah, so because I mean a lot of games like.

492
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:56,100
Speaker 0: we have a friend Scott Johnson and he's on defucking feedable at this game called acquired

493
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,168
Speaker 1: apparently a lot of people use that same strategy of

494
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:06,580
Speaker 0: yeah You save a lot of games if you sit there and think long enough You'll know exactly what to do because you can calculate every option

495
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:10,008
Speaker 1: because they're only there because there are too many options to think of them instantly.

496
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,310
Speaker 1: But it's not like chess where you would have to think forever to figure out every possible move.

497
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,849
Speaker 1: There's a limited number of moves and you can calculate the points of each one.

498
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:26,069
Speaker 0: however to me that Reduces the skill of the game because if everyone does that the game takes forever and then everyone makes the perfect move every round.

499
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:33,349
Speaker 1: and this I don't like a game where you can do that Even if there's a you know a whole bunch of choices because then a computer can beat the game.

500
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:35,069
Speaker 1: Computer can do it.

501
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:41,276
Speaker 0: Why am I doing that in Tigris and Euphrates and I've seen ways to do it where I could sit there and count and come up with statistics immediately.

502
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,505
Speaker 0: Well, not immediately, but I could come over the statistics.

503
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:54,710
Speaker 0: I don't think you could write of Fully optimized AI to play But I could come up with the percent chances I have of everything I want to do succeeding and I thought I sat there.

504
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,450
Speaker 1: You can think of every option and you see every future of every tile in acquire.

505
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:03,930
Speaker 1: You can see every spot that you can do something and figure out each move.

506
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:07,269
Speaker 1: That's possible not just each move you might want to do.

507
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:14,550
Speaker 0: But I think the point is in games like that Part of the skill is not only being able to think of what to do, but being able to think of it quickly.

508
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that they should have.

509
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,530
Speaker 1: a lot of games should have variants with egg timers.

510
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:20,917
Speaker 1: I might go buy an egg timer.

511
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:23,690
Speaker 0: We should get one or actually we should buy a chess timer.

512
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:25,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you get the little gaming egg timers.

513
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,142
Speaker 1: They're like specifically for games.

514
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:27,745
Speaker 1: They're one minute.

515
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are good.

516
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:34,974
Speaker 0: So, uh, is it to Time to leave?

517
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:51,171
Speaker 0: it's time to leave a legacy of Amadeus and That was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
