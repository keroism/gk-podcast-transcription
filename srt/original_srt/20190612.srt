1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,878
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, June 12th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,420
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,583
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:15,006
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:19,766
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about Gunsmith Cats, the OAV from the mid 90s.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,527
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:36,185
Speaker 0: So my office is right by a place in New York that most people know, like, if they live here or come here often, they know what this place is, but they don't know that it's called something.

8
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,370
Speaker 0: Pershing Square.

9
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:38,053
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

10
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:48,593
Speaker 0: That it's basically in the front of Grand Central Terminal or Grand Central Station and Terminal together, there's a little viaduct that has a road on it because they made a road split around Grand Central.

11
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:50,238
Speaker 1: Well, it's Park Avenue, right?

12
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:56,410
Speaker 1: Because basically you go down Park Avenue and to the left is, you know, Madison Avenue and to the right is Lexington Avenue.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:56,671
Speaker 1: Yep.

14
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:00,530
Speaker 1: But Park Avenue can't go right through the middle of the train station.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,110
Speaker 1: So it goes up and then it goes splits in half and goes around Grand Central, right?

16
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:13,849
Speaker 1: And then in the back of Grand Central, there's these two like ramps that turn and go down and then it becomes Park Avenue again.

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,739
Speaker 1: And then that Park Avenue is like a road.

18
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,890
Speaker 1: that's like has a big median in it to begin with, right?

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,229
Speaker 1: So it still has that big ass median on the other side.

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,164
Speaker 0: Yep, but under that little bridge, there's a restaurant.

21
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:27,670
Speaker 1: We went to it a long time ago.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,532
Speaker 0: Yep, and I remember they had a really good chicken pot pie and their breakfast is pathetic.

23
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:37,950
Speaker 1: It was really interesting because I would see the restaurant constantly because I went when the days when I went to Grand Central constantly.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I was like really just like, oh, I don't want to eat dinner there.

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,050
Speaker 1: It always had this sign in the front that was like best breakfast.

26
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,055
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

27
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:48,810
Speaker 1: And I ate the breakfast once and I was not impressed.

28
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,550
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, diner or less and it was more money than diner.

29
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:56,750
Speaker 0: But I would rather eat it at Denny's than eat there for breakfast.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,610
Speaker 1: But the dinner that I've had there a few times, but not in many, many years, who knows what's changed.

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had dinner there maybe a handful of times many years ago just because convenience.

32
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:14,530
Speaker 1: And the dinner, while not like interesting, it was like perfectly normal dishes of, you know, just like restaurant, whatever.

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they were quite good.

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,369
Speaker 1: Like it was very flavorful chicken and a nice potato.

35
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:28,250
Speaker 1: And, you know, it was like boring food, but high quality, boring food at not too much overpriced, considering it's right there in front of Grand Central.

36
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,710
Speaker 0: But at a restaurant like to picture this, it's basically built into the bottom of this bridge.

37
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:35,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

38
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,488
Speaker 1: So like on top of the restaurant is a road.

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,191
Speaker 1: Right.

40
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:45,450
Speaker 1: And on the left and right sides are roads that you can't really drive on because they're like they turn them into pedestrian only zone, kind of.

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:45,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

42
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:46,730
Speaker 0: So that's what I'm getting at.

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,324
Speaker 1: And right in front of the restaurant is 42nd Street.

44
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,412
Speaker 1: And right.

45
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:53,250
Speaker 1: If you just go out of the restaurant and just cross the road, there's entrance to Grand Central.

46
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:57,310
Speaker 1: So for a long time, Pershing Square is the name of like the square.

47
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:57,894
Speaker 1: Yeah.

48
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,429
Speaker 1: But it's also the name of the restaurant.

49
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:00,454
Speaker 0: Yeah.

50
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,350
Speaker 0: And there's a little old sign there.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:12,369
Speaker 0: But basically, this area was really kind of like run down, like the bridge and the sidewalk and like the streets that weren't on top of the bridge were all just really run down and beat up.

52
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,133
Speaker 1: Well, they've been.

53
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,090
Speaker 1: they've been polishing it slowly over the years.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,591
Speaker 1: Well, that's it.

55
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:25,690
Speaker 0: So a while ago, like over a year ago, they blocked it all off and they started doing a big reconstruction project and they actually only recently removed all those fences.

56
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,050
Speaker 0: Now it's just open again and there's a big pedestrian plaza there.

57
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:33,450
Speaker 0: And now there's kind of like in Times Square, they got all those tables in those in what used to be the street.

58
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:33,834
Speaker 0: Yeah.

59
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,270
Speaker 0: They got that same thing going on here.

60
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:43,170
Speaker 0: And now there's outdoor seating for that restaurant in that area and public seating that's not tied to the restaurant also there.

61
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:46,329
Speaker 0: So I've been eating lunch like outside of these tables is real nice.

62
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,930
Speaker 0: But something interesting happened.

63
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,828
Speaker 1: The restaurant harassed you?

64
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:51,257
Speaker 0: Oh, no, restaurant doesn't care.

65
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,263
Speaker 0: It's a public land.

66
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,310
Speaker 1: because I was going to say.

67
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,549
Speaker 1: But, you know, restaurants do that, right?

68
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they don't.

69
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:56,110
Speaker 0: They're there.

70
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:56,970
Speaker 0: They know better.

71
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,371
Speaker 0: OK.

72
00:03:57,652 --> 00:04:04,170
Speaker 0: And also right next to that in 120 Park, the whole lobby of that building is technically public space.

73
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,471
Speaker 1: Yep.

74
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,150
Speaker 0: So like you'll see people playing board games in there.

75
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,743
Speaker 0: I know that one.

76
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:08,070
Speaker 0: Yep.

77
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,909
Speaker 0: Like so there's a whole bunch of public spaces there now and it's a pretty good place to hang out.

78
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:18,170
Speaker 0: But when they open this area, it is technically designated as a park.

79
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:23,410
Speaker 0: And what that means is that in New York City, you cannot smoke in any park.

80
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,058
Speaker 0: That's right.

81
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,890
Speaker 0: No exceptions.

82
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,729
Speaker 0: Like the cops will bother you if you can.

83
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,956
Speaker 1: Smoke on the sidewalk.

84
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,250
Speaker 1: You can smoke in your own car that you own.

85
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,069
Speaker 1: You can smoke in your place of residence if you own it.

86
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,450
Speaker 1: And but like in my apartment building is no smoking rule.

87
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,912
Speaker 1: You can't.

88
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,910
Speaker 1: But, you know, if you own a house, no one's going to start smoking in your own house.

89
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,171
Speaker 1: Right.

90
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:40,533
Speaker 1: Yeah.

91
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:44,530
Speaker 0: Unless you own a house that's too close to someone else's house and you smoke too much.

92
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,270
Speaker 0: Maybe the point is over nuisance.

93
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:46,830
Speaker 1: Right.

94
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:50,970
Speaker 1: You can also smoke in certain like cigar shops have like smoking zones.

95
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:51,416
Speaker 1: Yeah.

96
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:51,740
Speaker 1: Right.

97
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:52,349
Speaker 1: Stuff like that.

98
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,050
Speaker 1: But you can't smoke in a place of business.

99
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,170
Speaker 1: You can't smoke in a park.

100
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,910
Speaker 1: You can't smoke in like, you know, your apartment that you rent that has a no smoking rule.

101
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,889
Speaker 1: You can, you know, you can't smoke at work.

102
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:06,970
Speaker 1: And it's worked in the sense that I encountered within a certain number of feet of an entrance to a building.

103
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,630
Speaker 1: You sort of have to walk away from the building entrance to somewhere else that's not near any building entrances.

104
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:11,991
Speaker 0: Yeah.

105
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:17,650
Speaker 0: And it's to the point that in New York City, like the rare times I run into someone smoke it, it's so obvious.

106
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:24,850
Speaker 1: Like I 99 percent of the time it's somebody walking on the sidewalk while smoking, which is pretty much the only place you can.

107
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,750
Speaker 1: So behind him and have to run past him.

108
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,330
Speaker 0: So something interesting happened because Pershing Square, the two sides of the bridge, the restaurant and the bridge are in the middle.

109
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,950
Speaker 0: One side now is a big park with tables, meaning no one can smoke there.

110
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,250
Speaker 0: And the other side of it is the city bike dock.

111
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,210
Speaker 0: The other side of it is not actually a park.

112
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:45,229
Speaker 0: It's just a pedestrian throughway.

113
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:55,150
Speaker 0: Everyone who smokes anywhere in that area, the area with the city bike docks is the only place that you can actually legally smoke.

114
00:05:55,931 --> 00:06:02,869
Speaker 0: So there are a ton of really sad looking people smoking there, sitting on the city bikes every day.

115
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,230
Speaker 0: They're just sitting on the city bike smoking.

116
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,809
Speaker 0: And there's one dude and I see him every day and I know which dude it is.

117
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,448
Speaker 0: He's smoking weed there every day.

118
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:13,096
Speaker 1: All right.

119
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:16,610
Speaker 0: We just don't smoke cigarettes, smoke weed every day.

120
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was going to make the show and then I got high.

121
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,008
Speaker 1: So you got any news?

122
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:24,688
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

123
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:35,630
Speaker 1: So, you know, there have been various attempts over the years to make more, you know, Warner Brothers, Looney Tunes, you know, Forky Pig Bugs Bunny cartoons.

124
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,673
Speaker 0: Make success.

125
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:39,142
Speaker 0: Like there was a recent one that was basically just.

126
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,670
Speaker 1: you could even count things like, you know, Tiny Toons.

127
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:42,770
Speaker 1: Like big success.

128
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

129
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:43,732
Speaker 1: Right.

130
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:46,970
Speaker 1: You know, and other ones, not so much like the Seinfeld one.

131
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:47,711
Speaker 1: Right.

132
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:53,510
Speaker 1: But now there is a much more recent one, like literally just now.

133
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,929
Speaker 1: And it seems like they're going to make a ton of them.

134
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,210
Speaker 1: And they're going to basically allow the animators to sort of go like full controls.

135
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:16,807
Speaker 1: Like the team that works on one is going to like write it, direct it, animate it like, you know, so you'll get a lot of, you know, Similar to when Adventure Time would have guest animators, they'd be like, yeah, do whatever the hell you want.

136
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:17,470
Speaker 0: Make it awesome.

137
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:25,690
Speaker 1: So they're apparently have already made a bunch and are going to make a bunch more and distribute them like on all the places that they can distribute them.

138
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:28,150
Speaker 1: And there is one on YouTube already.

139
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,449
Speaker 1: I didn't watch the whole thing.

140
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,428
Speaker 0: It was pretty good.

141
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,870
Speaker 1: But what I've seen of it, it's like it's basically old school.

142
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,769
Speaker 1: Like it's the real deal.

143
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,910
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, they just made more of those from the olden days.

144
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,048
Speaker 1: But it's the new days.

145
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,610
Speaker 0: I've said this repeatedly because we've talked about all these shows like She-Ra, which is OK.

146
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,169
Speaker 0: It's a children's show or BoJack, all these different, like there's a lot of animation happening right now.

147
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,633
Speaker 0: Dragon Prince.

148
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:56,030
Speaker 0: And we're entering like this new golden era of animation.

149
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:56,996
Speaker 0: We're already in it.

150
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:58,529
Speaker 0: And I think it's just still continuing to grow.

151
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:05,030
Speaker 0: But right now we're in an era where there are new good Mickey Mouse shorts and now new good Bugs Bunny shorts.

152
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:11,390
Speaker 1: I mean, I think, you know, on the one hand, it's nice to see people doing something, you know, new and different.

153
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:11,692
Speaker 1: Right.

154
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:14,450
Speaker 1: We don't need to just repeat the same thing over and over again forever.

155
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:15,273
Speaker 1: Right.

156
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,229
Speaker 1: We like to see new things, original works.

157
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,131
Speaker 1: Right.

158
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:24,750
Speaker 1: And, you know, when people do retread a lot of old things, though, you know, they try to put a spin on it.

159
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,768
Speaker 1: And that can be hit or miss.

160
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,349
Speaker 1: And the thing is, oftentimes I think usually it's miss.

161
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:30,634
Speaker 0: Yeah.

162
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:39,650
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of times and, you know, where it's like, hey, there was a thing that was good and we don't want to just repeat that good thing forever because that's tired and boring.

163
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,169
Speaker 0: But if you change it, you change the thing that was good about it.

164
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,551
Speaker 1: Right.

165
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,169
Speaker 1: But we didn't get enough of that good thing.

166
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:45,751
Speaker 1: Right.

167
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:50,070
Speaker 1: Like I always say, Metroidvanias, just make another fucking Super Metroid.

168
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,030
Speaker 1: The same exact fucking kind of thing can be Super Nintendo quality.

169
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,377
Speaker 1: Just bigger.

170
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:56,970
Speaker 1: Just how hard is this?

171
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,869
Speaker 0: Take Symphony of the Night as is.

172
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:02,130
Speaker 0: And now after you beat the Upside Down Castle, Sideways Castle.

173
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:02,869
Speaker 1: 4D Castle.

174
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,790
Speaker 0: Just more castle.

175
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:04,253
Speaker 1: Right.

176
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,490
Speaker 1: It's like you can just do the same.

177
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,250
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, yeah, that was great.

178
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,510
Speaker 1: And I see that you're doing something else, which could also be great.

179
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,490
Speaker 1: But we didn't get enough of that great thing you did.

180
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,610
Speaker 1: Just do it like one or two more times.

181
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,194
Speaker 1: Don't go nuts.

182
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,050
Speaker 1: Don't make like 10 Super Metroids.

183
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,230
Speaker 1: Then we're going to go to sleep, right?

184
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

185
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:22,070
Speaker 0: Like Mega Man, eight, nine, 10, 11.

186
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,172
Speaker 0: Yeah.

187
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,250
Speaker 1: It's like Mega Man 10.

188
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,720
Speaker 1: Good job.

189
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:24,190
Speaker 1: Eleven.

190
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,056
Speaker 1: It's like, all right.

191
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:26,469
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, come on.

192
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,050
Speaker 0: I feel like 11 was better than 10.

193
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,789
Speaker 1: The point is, we don't need that many more NES style Mega Mans.

194
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,070
Speaker 1: We got, you know, one or two was fine.

196
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,712
Speaker 1: You're right.

197
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,690
Speaker 1: They're starting to go overboard making too many.

198
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,092
Speaker 1: Right.

199
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:52,030
Speaker 1: But we do need another Super Metroid and we do need some more Looney Tunes, especially because a lot of the old Looney Tunes are racist, sexist, inappropriate or whatever, and probably shouldn't be watched anymore.

200
00:09:52,532 --> 00:09:52,652
Speaker 1: Right.

201
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:57,910
Speaker 1: There's only a handful of them that are, you know, still worthy and hold the test.

202
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:04,101
Speaker 0: I can tell just based on watching a few again recently, the Yosemite Sam ones are by and large fine.

203
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:04,729
Speaker 1: Yes.

204
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,749
Speaker 1: Partly because it's just it's just a pirate dude.

205
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,552
Speaker 0: Pirate dude.

206
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:12,470
Speaker 0: Yosemite Sam is a very accurate representation of rural America.

207
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,789
Speaker 1: Just an angry pirate dude.

208
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,629
Speaker 0: Angry gun toting dude.

209
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,690
Speaker 1: Whatever he is in the episode cowboy or whatever.

210
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,210
Speaker 0: He'd be on Twitter with his two way hashtag.

211
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,238
Speaker 1: Yeah.

212
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:27,630
Speaker 0: But no, I think these are really good.

213
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,409
Speaker 0: And I look forward to watching them.

214
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:37,229
Speaker 0: And if if they're as good as the one I just saw, but they're not all just the same as the one I just saw, I feel like we're going to be really good shape.

215
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:37,691
Speaker 0: Yeah.

216
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:44,810
Speaker 0: So in some other news, Utena, there's got to be no more Utena like we don't say.

217
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,910
Speaker 1: I mean, I thought it was going to be more Utena manga.

218
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,330
Speaker 0: There is going to be more Utena manga.

219
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,668
Speaker 0: But the manga is not why people care about Utena.

220
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,550
Speaker 0: Let's not pretend otherwise.

221
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,989
Speaker 0: That show is a triumph and it stands alone and apart.

222
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:05,848
Speaker 0: But the musicals perennially come and go and the musicals have started to up their game and escalate a little bit.

223
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,170
Speaker 0: So the current state of that is one.

224
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,150
Speaker 0: If you don't know that there are Utena musicals, go to YouTube.

225
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,210
Speaker 1: Well, there's musicals for like all kinds of anime.

226
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:15,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,910
Speaker 0: We've talked about this on Geek Nights before, like it's a thing.

228
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,713
Speaker 1: Tons of them.

229
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:20,530
Speaker 0: But the Utena ones are pretty interesting.

230
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:29,352
Speaker 1: And they had like a resurgence lately, or at least if it's not an actual resurgence, it's a resurgence of Americans, you know, like getting reporting about which ones are happening.

231
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:29,653
Speaker 0: Yep.

232
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:33,930
Speaker 0: Because like hardcore Utena fans were like obsessed with the old Utena.

233
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,550
Speaker 1: While we were at PAX, the Sailor Moon musical was like sold out in New York City.

234
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,810
Speaker 1: I would have gone to see it otherwise.

235
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:45,885
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid, I pirated all of the Sailor Moon music, including all the songs from the musicals.

236
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,416
Speaker 0: And I remember being really excited about that because I couldn't actually get video of the musicals like.

237
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,748
Speaker 0: that was really hard to pirate back in the 90s.

238
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,565
Speaker 1: I have seen it being played at anime cons in the 2000s.

239
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,074
Speaker 1: Yeah.

240
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,612
Speaker 1: You know, like you go into a showing room and you're like, oh, they're showing the musicals.

241
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,175
Speaker 1: Yeah.

242
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:07,429
Speaker 0: But I think to your point, what's happening now partly is that American anime fans are starting to find out that these exist.

243
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,210
Speaker 0: And I feel like the fandom of them is starting to grow, but it's still very niche.

244
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:21,489
Speaker 0: So if you're a fan of Utena, the big news is that they are bringing it now because the Utena musicals tended to only cover basically season one.

245
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,569
Speaker 0: They're doing Black Rose.

246
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:30,934
Speaker 0: And they're right now they're releasing like the teasers and what the character is going to look like.

247
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:36,269
Speaker 0: And I'll admit, I don't actually particularly like the Utena musicals.

248
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,256
Speaker 1: I haven't actually seen any.

249
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:44,510
Speaker 1: I haven't seen too much of any anime musical because I haven't had access or like put the effort in to get translated.

250
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:51,249
Speaker 0: The problem is generally watching a musical on a screen tends to not be a great experience for a lot of reasons.

251
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:51,752
Speaker 1: Yeah.

252
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:56,070
Speaker 1: But I hope that, you know, we can get some translated ones.

253
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,226
Speaker 1: But yeah, none of the ones that I have seen have been like things that I want to spend a lot of time on.

254
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:01,730
Speaker 0: Yep.

255
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:13,369
Speaker 0: So the Black Rose Arc Utena musical will be in Tokyo early July, and they've announced some of the cast members and there's a bunch of stuff going on.

256
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:14,828
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

257
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,250
Speaker 0: I'm just going to keep an eye on this.

258
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:25,390
Speaker 0: And at some point, maybe I will watch a not great quality video of this musical and talk about it and some news that is only adjacent to the anime world.

259
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:32,270
Speaker 0: But I think we need to talk about a little bit, as you are probably aware, that guy, Vic, who is a voice actor for a bunch of stuff.

260
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,590
Speaker 1: Why do we keep talking about it?

261
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:41,389
Speaker 0: We're talking about good people because they're all just continuing to do good stuff like Monica is just like she's casting, being cast for more anime and doing stuff.

262
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,730
Speaker 1: But the news is basically interesting to say about good people.

263
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not just that.

264
00:13:47,716 --> 00:14:00,310
Speaker 0: Vic is probably a creep, a large number of people have made allegations about his creepy harassing every interaction and, you know, time that I have seen him in my life.

265
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,329
Speaker 1: I got a, you know, negative aura feeling.

266
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,792
Speaker 0: I cannot say that I have witnessed him harass anyone, but I can say I've not witnessed him or have any specific memory of witnessing him doing something specifically bad.

267
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,790
Speaker 1: I can say he was just a distasteful person to be around.

268
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,411
Speaker 1: I did not.

269
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:27,730
Speaker 0: I can say that while he was very nice to me directly and all the times I interacted with him, he was an absolute prick to the rest of my staff.

270
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:29,708
Speaker 0: And I will leave it at that.

271
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:42,509
Speaker 0: So the news was not just that this whole nonsense is going on, but that there's a huge brigade of Internet shitlords who have decided that he is their Elon Musk and they are going around harassing people.

272
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,929
Speaker 1: Why can't I be someone's Elon Musk?

273
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,451
Speaker 0: Yeah.

274
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,970
Speaker 0: Do you want an army of shitlords on the Internet to do your bidding?

275
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,473
Speaker 1: Yeah.

276
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,690
Speaker 1: I'd send them to attack the other armies of shitlords.

277
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,329
Speaker 0: That's like the toner wars.

278
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,689
Speaker 1: I'd be like, I'd be like, all right, guys, here's what we're going to do.

279
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:01,990
Speaker 1: You're going to find every single person who's, you know, doxxing people, you know, well, in order to defend Vic.

280
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,809
Speaker 0: But Scott, who doxxes the doxxers?

281
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,251
Speaker 1: That's right.

282
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:08,210
Speaker 1: And doxx each and every one of them and send 10 pizzas to all the houses.

283
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:24,970
Speaker 0: So the crazy part of this is that either Vic is stupid or gullible because he actually did sue like the people who are making allegations against him and funimation because his career is basically over.

284
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,470
Speaker 1: The only conventions that are inviting him to do something else is not like he's going.

285
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,350
Speaker 1: He's not criminally charged with anything.

286
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,209
Speaker 1: He's not going to jail.

287
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,510
Speaker 1: He just lost his job.

288
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,587
Speaker 1: So go get a different job, bro.

289
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,191
Speaker 0: Yeah.

290
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,129
Speaker 0: Like being an anime voice actor.

291
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:45,910
Speaker 1: Like if for some reason I was kicked out of the tech industry because I don't know, everyone stopped using the technology that I know and I didn't want to learn anything.

292
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:47,689
Speaker 1: I just go do something else.

293
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,131
Speaker 0: Yeah.

294
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,030
Speaker 0: I think the problem is his career jobs left to do.

295
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,649
Speaker 1: I would do them even if I had to work like, you know, some shitty job.

296
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:03,250
Speaker 0: His career seems to be based primarily on the like the shakings you can get from the pockets of the nerds who adore him at conventions.

297
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:09,510
Speaker 1: Also, there are plenty of industries where like, you know, things are still really bad and no one gives a shit about sexual harassment.

298
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:18,992
Speaker 1: And if you're a sexual harasser, you can just go work in one of those really old school industries where everyone's still a scumbag until we've weeded out those scumbags as well.

299
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:28,829
Speaker 0: But in the voice acting world, not like what you're going to be a video game voice actor or an anime voice actor, because that's basically the horizon you've got if you're a voice acting B-lister.

300
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,350
Speaker 0: Like what other industry needs voice acting?

301
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:43,690
Speaker 0: You could do bit like jobber jobs for like an ad agency that does not pay a lot like that pays a per diem like here's four hundred bucks.

302
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,664
Speaker 0: Read these lines.

303
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,030
Speaker 0: Yeah.

304
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,110
Speaker 0: Crusty the Clown style.

305
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:51,629
Speaker 1: I'm sure Vic opened up a thing that was like, send me money and I'll do whatever you write, like the other people do.

306
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,545
Speaker 0: Like John St.

307
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:52,670
Speaker 0: John.

308
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,212
Speaker 0: John St.

309
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:57,370
Speaker 0: John was like the king of taking advantage of that in the correct way.

310
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,869
Speaker 1: But the point is, I'm sure he would make a lot of money if he did that.

311
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:04,670
Speaker 0: So basically, dude sued Funimation over all this.

312
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,609
Speaker 1: With Funimation, which is now owned by Sony and has deep pockets.

313
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I'm if I remember correctly, also sued a bunch of individual people.

314
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,109
Speaker 0: And it's pretty crazy that this is happening.

315
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,989
Speaker 1: You probably got some cuckoo bananas lawyer just like, you know, it was like a go fun me and all this nonsense.

316
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:32,342
Speaker 0: So the best Twitter thread I saw was someone who said to to paraphrase as a lawyer, I believe that what's about to happen is that Vic is going to learn what happens during discovery.

317
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:32,810
Speaker 0: That's right.

318
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:40,109
Speaker 0: So Funimation, the news is that they actually finally reacted to this and they basically said this ain't happening.

319
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,204
Speaker 0: You can write me a link to it.

320
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:42,809
Speaker 0: That's the news.

321
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:58,191
Speaker 0: So if you are in the anime world and you encounter this like mob of shitlords that are harassing people on Twitter because of it, I'm just going to point out that I found a list of the Twitter accounts that are doing

322
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:58,452
Speaker 1: this

323
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,223
Speaker 0: and I added them to my Twitter block list.

324
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:10,673
Speaker 0: So if you happen to subscribe to my Twitter block list, some sixty five hundred people will be blocked, including most of the people who are in this weird harassment brigade.

325
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:11,340
Speaker 1: It's so weird.

326
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,460
Speaker 0: It's like that's the crazy thing.

327
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,420
Speaker 1: I was not but I would subscribe to your Twitter block list.

328
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,022
Speaker 1: But for some reason, the way I use Twitter, I never see despite blocking basically almost nobody.

329
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:31,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never see a almost I almost never see a tweet from anyone that I would block unless the only way is if I go looking for them.

330
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,041
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.

331
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:37,997
Speaker 1: But unless I do something like click on one of the president's tweets and look at the replies.

332
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,421
Speaker 1: Yep.

333
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:44,405
Speaker 1: So I basically see no bad tweets to block because I don't follow anyone shitty or reply to anyone shitty.

334
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:47,300
Speaker 1: And because I'm a white dude, no one should he replies to me.

335
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

336
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:53,563
Speaker 0: But occasionally I will click on a tweet from like Planned Parenthood and I don't do that.

337
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then I see those responses.

338
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,254
Speaker 0: But also me and our good friend Adam have a friendly game going on.

339
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:03,020
Speaker 0: of how many shitty people can we get banned from Twitter?

340
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,240
Speaker 0: So every now and then, if I get bored, I'll click on like an AOC tweet and I'll just block and report everyone who replies.

341
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:18,640
Speaker 1: See, when I see a good tweet like that from a person I know who has haters, I do not click to see the replies of the tweet because I know that there will be nothing useful.

342
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:19,282
Speaker 0: Yep.

343
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:24,438
Speaker 0: I basically only do it as a public service to the people who do encounter these harassment brigades.

344
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:32,099
Speaker 0: And also because I have gotten a lot more people banned from Twitter than Adam and I'm winning that race and I want to stay ahead.

345
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:33,760
Speaker 1: Well, I think you spend a lot more time on the Internet.

346
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:34,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

347
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,440
Speaker 0: So one last little, little news.

348
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:38,999
Speaker 0: I love going to TCAF.

349
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,025
Speaker 0: Emily used to go every year.

350
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:44,180
Speaker 0: We didn't go this year because we're saving those vacation days to do a big Japan trip in the fall.

351
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,914
Speaker 0: But I have a little more regret that I didn't go to TCAF this year because Junji Ito was there.

352
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,273
Speaker 1: We, you know, we know we did some episodes about some Junji Ito works.

353
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:59,439
Speaker 0: Junji Ito did a panel recently, like a normal panel.

354
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:05,480
Speaker 0: He also did a panel where he live drew his horrifying art and talked about it.

355
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,236
Speaker 1: It was basically like everyone who wants to draw horrifying Junji Ito art, you know, have a how to, which is pretty unavailable.

356
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:16,055
Speaker 0: Luckily, this whole both of these panels are just on YouTube on.

357
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,940
Speaker 1: this is why you regret not being there, because you can just fucking see it on YouTube.

358
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:23,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would have been neat to see this in person because TCAF is a fun event.

359
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:28,680
Speaker 1: And I'm glad that sharks with legs stay as far away from them as possible.

360
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess I'll put it this way.

361
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,839
Speaker 0: I really like the Penny Arcade Q&A.

362
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,859
Speaker 0: Like that's one of the highlights of the packs for me.

363
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,939
Speaker 0: Probably wouldn't watch it on YouTube.

364
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:38,870
Speaker 0: No, there's something about Q&A's.

365
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,994
Speaker 1: we were not at that.

366
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,725
Speaker 1: we could easily watch on Twitch.

367
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:42,417
Speaker 1: that we just don't.

368
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,806
Speaker 0: It's kind of like.

369
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,354
Speaker 0: there are certain sporting events like.

370
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,320
Speaker 0: I like hockey.

371
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,918
Speaker 0: I don't watch every hockey game, but if I'm like if it's two teams I don't care about, I'm not going to watch it on TV.

372
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:02,019
Speaker 0: But if I happen to get tickets to see two teams I don't care about, I will gladly go live and watch that hockey game like Sabres versus I don't know, the St.

373
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,440
Speaker 0: Louis Blues, like, yeah, whatever.

374
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:06,240
Speaker 0: I'll see that in person, but not Bill's Jets football.

375
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:11,219
Speaker 0: That was the only sporting event I have ever just said fuck it and walked out of.

376
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:16,000
Speaker 0: We left before halftime and we just drove.

377
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was before halftime, but it was early.

378
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,359
Speaker 1: I think maybe it was halftime.

379
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,540
Speaker 0: I think we might have left like right around halftime.

380
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,699
Speaker 1: We definitely just left.

381
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,277
Speaker 0: Because I remember the moment because I remember like P was sitting there and even he was cold and I looked at you and I was like, should we should we really need?

382
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,778
Speaker 0: do we really need to stay for this game?

383
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:35,479
Speaker 0: And we all were like, no, we could just leave.

384
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,368
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

385
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:48,010
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

386
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,429
Speaker 0: So our good friend Luke Burrage is a juggler.

387
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,208
Speaker 0: He is a professional juggler.

388
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:56,490
Speaker 0: He is in our forum arguing with all of you.

389
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,809
Speaker 0: And you should go and argue with him because that's always a good time.

390
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:10,194
Speaker 0: But there's been a genre of YouTube video lately that I'm a big fan of where you get an expert in a thing and have them tear apart movie depictions of the thing they're an expert in.

391
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,950
Speaker 0: I like that genre video.

392
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,729
Speaker 0: Like last night, I watched a really, really good one.

393
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:21,490
Speaker 0: It was a CIA agent who is the head of disguise for the CIA for a long time.

394
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:25,950
Speaker 0: And she broke down disguise shit in spy movies.

395
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,207
Speaker 1: I saw a video yesterday where there was a former Navy SEAL who was doing.

396
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:32,569
Speaker 1: he did a video about situational awareness.

397
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,935
Speaker 1: But as a only a small portion of the video, he was reacting to stuff in the Bourne identity.

398
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:42,150
Speaker 1: Oh, it wasn't that the whole video wasn't like react to movie.

399
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:43,609
Speaker 1: It was just a small portion of the video.

400
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,770
Speaker 0: Actually, I saw a similar one.

401
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,053
Speaker 0: It was these FBI agents and they were like, here's the reality of trying to read someone's body language.

402
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:55,546
Speaker 0: And it was really in depth because he was most of the things you think of, like, oh, people tend to touch their like.

403
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:55,930
Speaker 0: none of that.

404
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,582
Speaker 0: It's all bullshit.

405
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:56,909
Speaker 0: Yeah.

406
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,081
Speaker 0: But he talked about very specific things and what they mean and how you can use them to like tell a story.

407
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,829
Speaker 1: I rubbed his hands together.

408
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,828
Speaker 1: His hands must be cold.

409
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,013
Speaker 0: Yep.

410
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:16,791
Speaker 0: But there's one specific example of people who are confident in what they're saying or unafraid of answering a question if they bring their hands together, tend to do the Mr.

411
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,289
Speaker 0: Burns thing or just like clasp their hands.

412
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,909
Speaker 0: People who are nervous tend to interlock their fingers and rub them.

413
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,584
Speaker 0: And there is some evidence about that's like a self soothing thing that that humans and monkeys both do.

414
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:30,870
Speaker 0: And that was very specific.

415
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:32,629
Speaker 1: Do they know knowing this?

416
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,390
Speaker 1: Then do they play the poison cup game of clasping fingers and confidently saying lies?

417
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:37,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

418
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:50,708
Speaker 0: He only talked about how to spot other people and like and and also we talked a lot about how that information is not 100 percent and how it's just one tool in your toolkit to figure out if someone's lying to you.

419
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,029
Speaker 1: But I think I can tell if someone's lying.

420
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:54,829
Speaker 1: Is there an AMRIM?

421
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:57,709
Speaker 0: I rarely lie.

422
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,187
Speaker 0: There's a lie right there.

423
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:01,053
Speaker 0: First one.

424
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:05,030
Speaker 0: So our friend Luke does this for juggling in movies.

425
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:06,690
Speaker 0: And I learned a lot watching this video.

426
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,649
Speaker 0: This is actually really good.

427
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,268
Speaker 0: The only thing I will warn you about is that he pronounces David Bowie's name in a very brightish way.

428
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,288
Speaker 0: That's all I'm going to say about that.

429
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:20,300
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

430
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,070
Speaker 1: So, you know, there is this cat.

431
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:24,730
Speaker 1: It is a fictional cat, but it is a cute cat.

432
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:33,130
Speaker 1: It is named Pusheen and Pusheen is doing a lot more action lately, like you think it's like, you know, Pusheen sort of had their day.

433
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:43,230
Speaker 1: But no, Pusheen's popularity seems to only be increasing the activities of the Pusheen Corporation, as opposed to which I believe is in Chicago, as opposed to a viral video that suddenly gets famous.

434
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,689
Speaker 0: Pusheen is this long, slow and steady smolder that just grows and grows and grows like.

435
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:56,794
Speaker 1: a website was recently completely redone by our friends, Joe and Conrad, who have been on this podcast.

436
00:24:57,055 --> 00:25:08,510
Speaker 1: I believe that they made the official new official Pusheen website, but that was like a month, some months ago already, just like yesterday or the day before Pusheen the cat opened its official YouTube channel.

437
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,350
Speaker 1: And it is not just like new YouTube channel one video.

438
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,050
Speaker 1: It's new YouTube channel, a lot of videos with more coming.

439
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:23,150
Speaker 1: So if you don't want to follow Pusheen on like Instagram or Twitter or whatever, you can follow Pusheen on YouTube.

440
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:31,010
Speaker 1: And there's the stuff that Pusheen has on YouTube is basically YouTube version, right, which is, I guess, better in some ways.

441
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,390
Speaker 1: It has audio and more animation.

442
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:47,270
Speaker 0: So in the moment, the Book Club book that we are going to talk about for the next Thursday show, Troy Dennings Pages of Pain, an officially licensed Dungeons and Dragons Planescape novel.

443
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:53,850
Speaker 1: I from nineteen nineties something I'm actually something I'm really interested to.

444
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:54,818
Speaker 0: This is the 90s.

445
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,649
Speaker 0: It's like ninety six.

446
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,196
Speaker 1: It feels like 90s.

447
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:56,358
Speaker 1: Yeah.

448
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:04,529
Speaker 0: I'm really interested to do this show because the difference between you and I, because we both went into it knowing, yeah, this is a D&D book.

449
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:08,790
Speaker 0: I had read it once before, but my memory was it's the best.

450
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:12,685
Speaker 1: I think it's the only maybe the only I think the only one.

451
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,810
Speaker 0: it's only one you should even consider reading.

452
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,573
Speaker 1: Well, I think I would say it's the only D&D book I ever read, but that's actually not true.

453
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:24,150
Speaker 1: I had a. I don't know if it was D&D, but it was TSR.

454
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,293
Speaker 1: It was a TSR.

455
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:30,714
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure book, which gets into a mech suit and is the president.

456
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:32,650
Speaker 0: I don't know.

457
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:34,709
Speaker 0: I don't know which one that might still have it.

458
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,570
Speaker 0: I don't know because there's a bunch of those kinds of things anyway.

459
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:52,664
Speaker 0: But I'm really curious because the the only difference between you and I reading this book is that I know a lot about the Planescape setting, or at least I knew a lot about the Planescape setting as it existed in the 90s.

460
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:03,450
Speaker 1: I know about Planescape from playing Planescape torment once, but sort of cheating and not paying too much attention now and also absorbing being around nerds.

461
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,689
Speaker 1: You talked about Planescape a lot.

462
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,770
Speaker 1: Yup, but that's I never read a Planescape.

463
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,350
Speaker 0: You knew the lady of pain was the sword head lady.

464
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,930
Speaker 1: Yes, I never read a Planescape source book or anything like that.

465
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,191
Speaker 0: Yup.

466
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:20,509
Speaker 1: So the cool thing is, you know, actually we played one of the forum games he played was technically a Planescape game.

467
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe that was the one where I was the little dragon guy, the Mind Flayer.

468
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, you were the Mind Flayer.

469
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:26,970
Speaker 0: OK, that was a Planescape game.

470
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,457
Speaker 1: All right.

471
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:28,049
Speaker 1: There you go.

472
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was that was my Planescape experience.

473
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, Planescape.

474
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:31,730
Speaker 0: All right.

475
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:37,670
Speaker 0: I've always wanted to play Planescape games, but my group in high school was much more invested.

476
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:38,490
Speaker 1: Forgot 10 Realms.

477
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,669
Speaker 1: Forgot 10 Realms is just one realm.

478
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, Forgot Realms is just one realm.

479
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,369
Speaker 1: You're also in Planescape, right?

480
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,190
Speaker 0: Well, yes, everything is in Planescape.

481
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,630
Speaker 0: That's right.

482
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,929
Speaker 0: Except Ravenloft is sharted off at its own thing.

483
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:54,970
Speaker 0: And Dark Sun is also cut off from the multiverse for its own reasons.

484
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,523
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

485
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,050
Speaker 1: And let's just make a heretical D&D game where you go there anyway.

486
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,068
Speaker 0: No, you're not allowed to.

487
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:01,129
Speaker 1: Stop me.

488
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,190
Speaker 0: Gary Gygax will come back from the dead and get you.

489
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,829
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

490
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,769
Speaker 1: We want to resurrect him.

491
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:06,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could use it.

492
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:13,929
Speaker 1: We'd be like, dudes, we just played a D&D game and we opened a portal from Sigil to It's pronounced Sigil.

493
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,609
Speaker 1: Whatever, to Ravenloft.

494
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:17,089
Speaker 1: And we mispronounced Sigil.

495
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,050
Speaker 1: And that got Gary Gygax so mad that he came back from the dead.

496
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,530
Speaker 1: Check out the zombie Gary Gygax.

497
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,730
Speaker 1: He's running our game now to prevent us from doing these heretical things and making sure our pronunciation is correct.

498
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,390
Speaker 0: Oh, what are the not-hobbits, the Dragonlance ones?

499
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,088
Speaker 1: Halflings?

500
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:32,268
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

501
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:33,729
Speaker 0: Kender, Kender.

502
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,509
Speaker 1: It's the we'll have a game.

503
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,549
Speaker 1: I have heard that word before.

504
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,750
Speaker 0: So Kender are basically, they're only a dragon.

505
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,809
Speaker 1: That is a word I have heard.

506
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,589
Speaker 0: So Dragonlance are also technically a D&D setting, but that's even worse.

507
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,830
Speaker 0: But I don't think that's in the modern cosmology of Planescape anyway.

508
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,550
Speaker 0: But they had their own version of halflings that were a hundred times more annoying.

509
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:58,769
Speaker 0: And they're best not spoken of.

510
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,390
Speaker 0: We'll have both Kender and halflings.

511
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,030
Speaker 0: You know what?

512
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,630
Speaker 0: We'll even have some gnomes and some quarterlings in this game.

513
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:05,208
Speaker 1: And hobbits.

514
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,122
Speaker 0: Hobbitses.

515
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,410
Speaker 0: All right.

516
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,108
Speaker 0: You want to get into this?

517
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:09,989
Speaker 0: We got any other meta?

518
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:10,669
Speaker 0: We got no cons.

519
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,123
Speaker 0: So PAX.

520
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,750
Speaker 0: PAX ain't sold out yet, but Friday is going to sell out pretty soon, I think.

521
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,569
Speaker 1: Well Saturday's sold out.

522
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,068
Speaker 1: Sunday's almost sold out.

523
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,830
Speaker 1: The full day, a full weekend passes.

524
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,250
Speaker 1: This is PAX West in Seattle, by the way, on Labor Day weekend.

525
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:24,923
Speaker 0: Yep.

526
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:32,810
Speaker 0: The problem is with PAX is that they keep moving and moving to the point that they're all clustered like one after the other.

527
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,770
Speaker 1: So basically we don't have... Well, basically not in the summer, right?

528
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,870
Speaker 1: So as soon as you get through with summer, it's like Labor Day, PAX, then you got Unplugged in Australia.

529
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,963
Speaker 0: October, October, PAX OSS, November, PAX Unplugged, early January, PAX South.

530
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,090
Speaker 0: And then right away, like late February, early March, maybe April, PAX East.

531
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:50,329
Speaker 1: And then summer.

532
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:50,899
Speaker 0: Yep.

533
00:29:52,671 --> 00:30:00,650
Speaker 0: It's annoying in one sense in that we used to have this cycle of like write a bunch of panels and then do a PAX, and we have some time to be like, "Okay, what was good?

534
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,241
Speaker 0: Let's shift it

535
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:01,385
Speaker 0: up.".

536
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:06,709
Speaker 0: Now I get to write all the panels for all the PAXes in one go and submit them all at the same time.

537
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,629
Speaker 0: It's getting... It's moderate.

538
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,510
Speaker 0: It's not stressful, but it is annoying.

539
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,570
Speaker 0: But I don't know if I want more PAXes or I just want the existing PAXes to spread out.

540
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,949
Speaker 1: If there's enough PAXes, I can get them to pay me an equipment job.

541
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:21,070
Speaker 0: If there was one PAX a month, I think I could turn that into a living.

542
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,129
Speaker 0: So, gunsmith cats.

543
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:34,150
Speaker 1: So way back at the RIT Anime Club, right, in like one of the first... No, this is the first, but one of the first showings we went to was this anime.

544
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,230
Speaker 1: This was before we ran the RIT Anime Club.

545
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,950
Speaker 1: That was the last time I saw this before yesterday.

546
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:39,220
Speaker 1: Yep.

547
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:42,989
Speaker 1: And so that was like, what, 20 years ago.

548
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:49,230
Speaker 0: This OAV came out in like '96, so I was a freshman in high school.

549
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,769
Speaker 0: So I didn't see it until the year 2000 when we went to RIT.

550
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:03,450
Speaker 1: And all I remember watching it was, there was the girl with guns, the car, the girl with a bunch of grenades, and it was just sort of crazy and ridiculous.

551
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,170
Speaker 1: And watching it in a big group, it was a lot of fun and people got real excited.

552
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:08,402
Speaker 1: Yep.

553
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,489
Speaker 0: The crowd went crazy.

554
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,870
Speaker 0: It was only three episodes.

555
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,929
Speaker 1: Everyone, people were laughing hysterically at certain parts.

556
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:14,330
Speaker 0: Yep, it was only three episodes.

557
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,810
Speaker 0: It's pretty well animated, like it had a pretty high production value for like the era.

558
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:19,910
Speaker 0: Like it looks good.

559
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,623
Speaker 0: Like a lot of that...

560
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:29,710
Speaker 1: So much more recently, Dark Horse released all of the manga, Gunsmith Cats and Gunsmith Cats Burst, and I bought it all and read it all.

561
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,870
Speaker 1: I don't know if I kept any of it, I may or may not.

562
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,510
Speaker 1: If I do have it, it's on one of my back shelves hiding behind other manga.

563
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,650
Speaker 0: Yep, I never actually read the manga, but... And you know what?

564
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,730
Speaker 1: Even though I read absolutely all of it, I remember almost none of it, basically.

565
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:44,606
Speaker 1: Yeah.

566
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:45,930
Speaker 1: It was not memorable.

567
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,484
Speaker 1: And anyway, there's also...

568
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:57,710
Speaker 0: I remember the OAV more of it than I expected, because what I remembered before we watched it again was in the first episode, she does a cool ricochet thing with a shotgun.

569
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:05,429
Speaker 0: In the second episode, that Russian Spetsnaz lady fucking murders everybody, and she has a gun knife, which is a real thing.

570
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:11,369
Speaker 0: And the third episode is a little spooky, and it gets a little dire toward the end, and people die.

571
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:13,240
Speaker 1: And then...

572
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:15,610
Speaker 0: I also remembered she had the Shelby Cobra.

573
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,127
Speaker 1: Right.

574
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,110
Speaker 1: So there's this related thing called, like, Bean Bandit.

575
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,638
Speaker 1: Riding Bean.

576
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:28,950
Speaker 1: Which is a character, Bean Bandit, who is in the manga and is not in this anime, but he has his own spin-off anime, which is just a movie, called Riding Bean.

577
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,289
Speaker 0: I have not seen Riding Bean since I was in high school.

578
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,910
Speaker 1: I watched the Riding Bean anime VHS from the RIT Anime Club.

579
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,769
Speaker 1: I took it out of the library, and I watched it once, and then I returned it.

580
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,170
Speaker 0: I want to say I rented it from Blockbuster.

581
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,289
Speaker 1: I don't remember much of it.

582
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,430
Speaker 0: Pretty sure I got it from Blockbuster Video.

583
00:32:45,930 --> 00:33:00,870
Speaker 1: All of these things were made by a man named Kinichi Tsunoda, so what you have to know about this guy, is this is a guy, this is a Japanese dude, right, who I don't know how significant he is in Japan, right?

584
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:15,310
Speaker 1: It seems like... It seems like he had his day in Japan, where he was big, and like, his manga was big enough to be animated, right, into movies and OAVs, but it seems like he was bigger in America, at least compared to other manga artists.

585
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:25,790
Speaker 0: Which I think partly because Riding Bean and Gunsmith Cats came out at two, like, big inflection points for American anime fandom, and got, for the time, pretty wide releases.

586
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,210
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's also, I know he definitely came to conventions here and made appearances and stuff.

587
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,060
Speaker 1: I don't know how much...

588
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,330
Speaker 0: People cosplaying as Riley Vincent at early Otakobs.

589
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:43,730
Speaker 1: But also, this dude, maybe he's part of the reason he was coming to America and doing, you know, and stuff like this, is because this guy's America fanboy.

590
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:53,730
Speaker 1: He loves cars, he loves guns, he loves American cars, yes, he loves boobs, and butts, and naked ladies, right?

591
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,368
Speaker 1: That's the kind of guy he is.

592
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:01,290
Speaker 0: And weird, technically, she's 30 years old nonsense, he's a problematic figure.

593
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:17,947
Speaker 1: So, if you look at the manga and the anime, like, you know, the guns are so perfectly illustrated down to the tiniest detail modeled after real guns, the Shelby Cobra is drawn in, like, ridiculously higher resolution infidelity, but unlike Initial D, the characters are also drawn well.

594
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:18,440
Speaker 1: Right.

595
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:31,690
Speaker 1: The characters are drawn well, but still much less than the car, and it seems like most of the work he's had in the anime industry, other than the things he's worked on that were his original works, were basically character design for other things.

596
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,810
Speaker 1: He hasn't, you know, done a lot of original stuff.

597
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,530
Speaker 1: Also, it seems like he hasn't done anything at all in a large number of years.

598
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,010
Speaker 0: So, I know what he's up to.

599
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,310
Speaker 1: And according to Wikipedia, he's working at his family's candy store.

600
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:52,909
Speaker 0: Yup, by adding lemon peels to his family's existing candies, and providing his own bishoujo illustrations for the packaging, he's up to his same bullshit.

601
00:34:53,251 --> 00:35:00,269
Speaker 1: Right, but it's like, the point is, he, you know, it was a guy who had his moment in the sun, and went away.

602
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,870
Speaker 0: What a Wikipedia article.

603
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:09,570
Speaker 0: His personal life section says, and I quote, Sonora is a self-confessed gun fanatic, owning several replica guns.

604
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,350
Speaker 1: Right, because he can't have real ones in Japan, right?

605
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that is a sentence for a Wikipedia article.

606
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,449
Speaker 1: I think he's also done-

607
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,990
Speaker 0: He worked on, like, Doll Force, and Bubble Gum stuff-

608
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:30,030
Speaker 1: I don't know if this is true, but I get the- because there was also another guy who did this, I forget his name, but I think he's also done, like, American comic stuff a little bit, maybe.

609
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:30,890
Speaker 1: Anyway.

610
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,319
Speaker 1: Yeah.

611
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:43,608
Speaker 1: But yeah, there are other people who know a lot more about this guy, and can probably talk for hours about, you know, what the deal with him is, but you have to know about this dude to understand this work, right?

612
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,309
Speaker 0: Now, one thing I would say is, we're going to focus on the OAV, because- That's what I watched yesterday.

613
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:54,110
Speaker 0: Yes, you do not need to know anything about the Gunsmith Cats universe to watch that OAV.

614
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,350
Speaker 1: Right, if you read the Gunsmith Cats manga, you will get the full story of Gunsmith Cats.

615
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,530
Speaker 0: Because it was originally just the Gunsmith Cat.

616
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:05,709
Speaker 1: Who are these people, how did they get together, how did they get in this business, what their deal is.

617
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,969
Speaker 0: That is less interesting than the OAV.

618
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:08,530
Speaker 0: Right.

619
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,730
Speaker 1: You'll also, in the manga, get some really bad stuff, right?

620
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,067
Speaker 1: So if you don't know the girl, Minnie May, right?

621
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,050
Speaker 1: She is, in the manga, you will learn, she is actually like a teenager, basically.

622
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:28,689
Speaker 1: And in the anime, in the first episode, there's a very short scene where she looks at a photo of a dude longingly, and they don't mention that dude again.

623
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:34,230
Speaker 1: In the manga, that dude is her boyfriend, he's there, he's way old, and she's a teenager, and it's totally fucked up.

624
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,566
Speaker 0: Doesn't she like take drugs to keep herself young?

625
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:40,670
Speaker 0: I don't know about that, I don't remember, but- There's weird shit with her.

626
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,450
Speaker 1: It is interesting that the boyfriend's name is Ken, and the guy we just talked about who's.

627
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,286
Speaker 1: the creator is Ken "Ichi" Sonoda.

628
00:36:49,931 --> 00:37:00,410
Speaker 0: Oh my god, yes, May is tiny and young, appearing for her age, having taken growth-stunting drugs in an effort to stay attractive to Ken, the aforementioned guy.

629
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,361
Speaker 0: She can pass for a child of ten or tw-.

630
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:03,670
Speaker 0: Don't read the manga.

631
00:37:04,275 --> 00:37:04,666
Speaker 1: I read it.

632
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,470
Speaker 0: Do not read the manga.

633
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,668
Speaker 1: I don't know if I still have it, though.

634
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

635
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:15,549
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, other than like the creepy facts like that, though the manga is basically just a lot like these OAVs, only just more of it.

636
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,578
Speaker 0: But the beauty of the OAV is that

637
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,220
Speaker 1: a lot

638
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:40,906
Speaker 0: of 90s anime have this dynamic of there's a bunch of characters, and you kind of figure out their deal insofar as it matters instantly, and you just have this story with a whole bunch of characters that all play their part, and watching Gunsmith Cats again really reminded me, it's not the best anime, it's got a lot of flaws, but it reminded me of all the things I really liked about these 90s OAVs.

639
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,270
Speaker 1: I mean, this OAV, even though it's three episodes, it's actually just a movie.

640
00:37:47,450 --> 00:38:02,750
Speaker 1: It's not a movie like top-tier movie when you think of anime movies, but it is 90 minutes of animation with one contiguous story that just happens to be chopped up into three acts with an opener and a closer between separating the acts.

641
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,350
Speaker 0: The opener is basically the Cowboy Bebop opener.

642
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,490
Speaker 1: Or the Cowboy Bebop opener is the Guns for the Cats opener.

643
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:14,090
Speaker 1: It's jazz music with colors and panning and, you know, three dramatic guns.

644
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,348
Speaker 1: If you cut out the opener's enclosures and pasted all three of these together, it would be a movie.

645
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:19,087
Speaker 0: Yup.

646
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,510
Speaker 1: Like a made-for-TV-movie quality level, right?

647
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,010
Speaker 1: Not like a, you know, movie, cinema movie quality movie.

648
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,130
Speaker 0: So what is this movie?

649
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:31,842
Speaker 0: It is basically, we're in the city of Chicago, and there are these two women who run a gun shop.

650
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,488
Speaker 1: Yup.

651
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,310
Speaker 1: They're also bounty hunters.

652
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:34,665
Speaker 0: Yes.

653
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,670
Speaker 0: They are bounty hunters.

654
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:36,989
Speaker 0: They run a gun shop.

655
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,910
Speaker 0: The gun shop is perfectly legal and like regulated gun stuff.

656
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,029
Speaker 0: Like their customers are cops because that's just how it is.

657
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:52,130
Speaker 0: But they also have a large collection of extremely illegal firearms to support their bounty hunting.

658
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,690
Speaker 1: Well, also because, you know, she's a gun nut because the author is a gun nut.

659
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:56,910
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:38:57,231 --> 00:39:01,830
Speaker 0: The main character is a hyper competent gun nut who knows her shit.

661
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:02,728
Speaker 0: Also a car nut.

662
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,120
Speaker 0: Yup.

663
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:05,870
Speaker 0: Private investigator drives a Shelby Cobra.

664
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:10,389
Speaker 0: If you don't know what a Shelby Cobra is, it's a very rare and special car.

665
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:12,489
Speaker 1: It's a very American muscle car.

666
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:12,987
Speaker 1: Yup.

667
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,407
Speaker 0: There aren't many of them.

668
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:15,630
Speaker 1: There's enough.

669
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:17,130
Speaker 1: It's not ultra rare.

670
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:17,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

671
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,349
Speaker 0: But it's pretty rare.

672
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,901
Speaker 0: If you got money, you can get one.

673
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,930
Speaker 0: There are a lot of adjacent cars, but the Cobra was a rare one.

674
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:33,590
Speaker 0: Anyway, her partner is basically an explosives expert in the same vein as movies like Predator.

675
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,490
Speaker 0: You have the team and there's always the one on the team.

676
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,050
Speaker 1: Well, it's like Team Fortress.

677
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,930
Speaker 1: You got Gunperson and Demoman.

678
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:40,418
Speaker 0: Yup.

679
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:42,750
Speaker 1: You see a gun and Demoman.

680
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:51,430
Speaker 0: So like the running gag will be, there'll be a tense scene and Riley has a pistol or something and like gunfights and Mini May will just fucking blow up the building.

681
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:58,970
Speaker 1: She usually uses flash bangs and smoke grenades and is super clumsy with them and only uses Not clumsy, careless.

682
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,150
Speaker 1: Yes, but the explosives are usually reserved for traps when they're far away from them.

683
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,430
Speaker 1: She's throwing usually flash bangs and smoke.

684
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,522
Speaker 0: A lot of the jokes, like the throwaway games come down to.

685
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:16,249
Speaker 0: Riley's got a gun and she's like looking down a stairway and then Mini May kind of slides up behind her just holding a fist full of grenades.

686
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:18,730
Speaker 1: That's when the anime club got excited.

687
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:19,153
Speaker 0: Yup.

688
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:21,429
Speaker 0: And then you get the long distance shot.

689
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:26,010
Speaker 0: You see the house like way in the background, you just hear a pop and then smoke comes out the window.

690
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:26,565
Speaker 1: Yup.

691
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,768
Speaker 0: That kind of stuff.

692
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:34,670
Speaker 1: So the movie, these three episodes are, you know, they're not telling you any of the plot of the characters.

693
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,210
Speaker 1: There's no real character development or anything that happens here.

694
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,109
Speaker 1: They're assuming that you already read the manga or you don't have to have, right?

695
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,330
Speaker 1: But they don't bother introducing the characters very much, although you'll get it right away.

696
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:45,750
Speaker 1: Yup.

697
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:47,429
Speaker 1: It's just a side story.

698
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,570
Speaker 1: I don't believe this story was in the manga at all.

699
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,070
Speaker 1: It's like a complete side story, the same sort of like a cowboy bebop movie, right?

700
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,568
Speaker 1: It's just like a side story doesn't interfere, right?

701
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,330
Speaker 1: You could insert it pretty much anywhere into the into the main plot.

702
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:10,508
Speaker 1: You know, it's like is a bad guy is the story of them, you know, dealing with the bad guy, the ATF agent, the cops, you know, the Russian, the whole situation, right?

703
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:16,547
Speaker 1: And then resolving it over the course of, you know, 90 minutes, then the end back to status quo.

704
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,950
Speaker 0: And it has a pretty good progression.

705
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,310
Speaker 0: Like the three acts work pretty well.

706
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:29,430
Speaker 0: Like act one is basically the somewhat silly plot where they get roped into some hijinks and the cops sort of extort them into helping the cops with this dangerous investigation.

707
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:29,910
Speaker 1: Yup.

708
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:31,268
Speaker 0: And it's mostly funny.

709
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:35,750
Speaker 0: And then act two is like, oh, there's something bigger going on.

710
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,430
Speaker 0: This Russian like former Spetsnaz person.

711
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:45,670
Speaker 1: They thought they took care of it in episode one, but no episode two, actually, this is a much bigger deal and you don't want to be involved.

712
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,950
Speaker 1: But now you sort of are being forced to and a big shootout thing happens.

713
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:50,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

714
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:53,510
Speaker 0: It's a big shootout and a little bit of a. I'm too old for this shit.

715
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,010
Speaker 1: Yup.

716
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,730
Speaker 0: And then act three is no, this is dire and people are going to die.

717
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,550
Speaker 1: That crazy Russian person who you shot at and is upset and is now coming after you.

718
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,890
Speaker 1: And also the big boss has been revealed.

719
00:42:06,434 --> 00:42:07,469
Speaker 1: The end episode three.

720
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,089
Speaker 0: And it holds up pretty well.

721
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,810
Speaker 0: Like if you're an anime fan, it's worth watching.

722
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,729
Speaker 0: It's just on YouTube.

723
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:15,287
Speaker 0: You could just go watch it right now.

724
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,410
Speaker 1: Well, it's on YouTube illegally.

725
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,870
Speaker 1: But yeah, the things, you know, that are positive about it, if you really like illustrations of guns and cars.

726
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,220
Speaker 0: Yup.

727
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,510
Speaker 1: But, you know, there's also parts of the gun.

728
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:34,569
Speaker 1: There are also lots of scenes where there are just excuses for characters to have a lot less clothes on than otherwise.

729
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:43,030
Speaker 0: But what's funny and Dave Riley said this a bunch of times in the past, but it's almost wholesome compared to what that kind of fan service is in the modern era.

730
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:43,689
Speaker 0: That's true.

731
00:42:43,951 --> 00:42:45,108
Speaker 1: Also, some of the scenes.

732
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,650
Speaker 1: For example, it's like these two girls living together in a house.

733
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:48,969
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:55,030
Speaker 1: So for them to be like sitting in the kitchen table wearing only their underwear talking is like I feel like normal.

735
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,493
Speaker 1: That's like.

736
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,629
Speaker 1: that's how I live my life.

737
00:42:56,714 --> 00:42:56,870
Speaker 1: Right.

738
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:57,990
Speaker 1: It's like that seems normal.

739
00:42:58,112 --> 00:42:59,209
Speaker 1: And they're just illustrating it.

740
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:06,150
Speaker 1: You know, they're just happen to be have, you know, stereotypically sexy bodies or whatever, wearing sexy underwear.

741
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:14,030
Speaker 1: But like every scene that's most egregious is an episode two where the bad guy attacks by using the warehouse crane hook.

742
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:14,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

743
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:14,744
Speaker 0: Yeah.

744
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:16,049
Speaker 0: I was going to bring that up.

745
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,908
Speaker 1: And it happens.

746
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:30,110
Speaker 1: A giant hook is being is swinging at this woman and it just so just so happens to tear her shirt open right down the middle and tear her bra open right down the middle.

747
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,630
Speaker 0: Nineties anime, ladies and gentlemen, it's a giant hook.

748
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,859
Speaker 1: It's not like some, you know, it's like really.

749
00:43:36,361 --> 00:43:38,109
Speaker 1: it's not like a sword slash cutting the open.

750
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:40,939
Speaker 0: But the other like the good.

751
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:45,850
Speaker 0: positive aspect of the thing about it is that it's set in Chicago and they did their research.

752
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,500
Speaker 1: It is like, well, because he's and you know, this guy is a fanboy of guns, cars, America, boobs.

753
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,629
Speaker 1: Well, crime is like, yeah, Chicago.

754
00:43:53,830 --> 00:44:04,829
Speaker 0: So the anime was adapted by Takeshi Mori, who, according to this article, didn't know anything about guns at all, but knew a lot about cars.

755
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:13,270
Speaker 0: So they actually took some of the production crew to go to Chicago to scout locations, to get backgrounds, to do research.

756
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,370
Speaker 0: They actually visited gun shops and they went to a police academy and got firearms training.

757
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,949
Speaker 0: And then they use that to make the anime.

758
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:21,870
Speaker 1: Trying hard.

759
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:22,484
Speaker 0: Yep.

760
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:29,168
Speaker 0: And they actually went so far as to get a Shelby Cobra GT500 and record the sound effects for the anime.

761
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,810
Speaker 1: They didn't buy the car.

762
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,489
Speaker 1: They just found someone who let them listen to it.

763
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,721
Speaker 0: Yeah.

764
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,550
Speaker 0: And they got the sound effects and made it legit.

765
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,209
Speaker 1: I was going to say.

766
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,370
Speaker 0: And it's funny because half the gunplay is very noir.

767
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,030
Speaker 0: Like goons just fall over instantly dead.

768
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,249
Speaker 0: You don't see a lot of blood or any blood.

769
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:49,030
Speaker 0: But then a few moments are much more realistic about the guns.

770
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:55,930
Speaker 0: Like it's a weird thing to point out, but ricochets are hyper realistic for some reason.

771
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,090
Speaker 0: But the noir stuff is just John Wick style.

772
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,629
Speaker 0: A hundred Russians die.

773
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,670
Speaker 0: The gunfights are really fun though.

774
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:08,161
Speaker 0: They're more interesting than most of the noir gunfights, I would say after episode four of noir.

775
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:09,250
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:16,162
Speaker 1: If you want a nostalgia trip back to 90s anime, if you don't mind some of the negative parts of 90s anime.

777
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:27,930
Speaker 0: If you want to see like in a really tight example of what popular 90s anime was like, this is like, this is the shortest path to experiencing that.

778
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:37,570
Speaker 1: You can also learn about this Kinichi Tsunoda guy who was important/infamous in a time and a place in this really narrow.

779
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:41,950
Speaker 1: It's like a really big fish in this tiny pond for a period of time.

780
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:49,309
Speaker 1: You know, I guess we'll be remembered by some anime nerds and then, you know, it feels like we'll be forgotten at some point.

781
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:56,389
Speaker 0: Every now and then some nerds like us will do a panel at a random anime convention talking about, so you ever heard of this guy?

782
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:58,462
Speaker 0: Let's talk about this guy.

783
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,348
Speaker 0: none of you have heard of.

784
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,190
Speaker 0: But I now kind of have this itch I need to scratch.

785
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,070
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch like Bubblegum Crisis again.

786
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,790
Speaker 1: But you did character design for that, right?

787
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,126
Speaker 1: Yeah.

788
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:14,870
Speaker 0: But like that 90s anime, like I'm starting to feel it again.

789
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,069
Speaker 1: Bubblegum Crisis I think is much better than this.

790
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Bubblegum Crisis is also not great.

791
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,269
Speaker 1: No, it just is better than this.

792
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,562
Speaker 1: Yep.

793
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,808
Speaker 1: This means great.

794
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:26,809
Speaker 0: The only real important part of Bubblegum Crisis is that the 80 police suck.

795
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:27,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

796
00:46:34,743 --> 00:46:36,880
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
