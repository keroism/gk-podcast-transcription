1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:17,358
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, November 8th, 2016, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight, Uwe Rosenberg's Patchwork.

2
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,908
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,920
Speaker 0: So it's election day, which means that my Twitter is going to go back to mostly normal most likely, and you guys can unmute me probably.

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,366
Speaker 0: Hooray!

5
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:42,040
Speaker 0: But, I would say, God, Jesus Christ, vote, but there's no way you're going to listen to this and still have the opportunity to vote because it's going to be over.

6
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,360
Speaker 0: In fact, during the course of the show, it's likely we'll find out how the election went.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,059
Speaker 1: Hopefully, people listening to this don't live in the United States.

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically- I know a lot of them don't.

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,612
Speaker 0: If you're nervous about the U.S.

10
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:56,257
Speaker 0: election- I'm not.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:04,660
Speaker 0: The one thing I can tell you out there is that you probably don't have to stay up all night because Trump, there's a bunch of states that he has to win or it's over.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,280
Speaker 0: Clinton, basically, is the default winner unless Trump wins all of those states.

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,018
Speaker 0: One of those is Florida, and Florida's polls close in like 20 minutes as of when we're doing the show right now.

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,460
Speaker 1: It takes a while to count, though.

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,260
Speaker 0: But they already counted six million of them because six million people did early voting.

16
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,357
Speaker 0: That's more people than voted in total in the 2000 election.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,294
Speaker 0: Turnout is high, which means- Turnout is way- I had to wait.

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,480
Speaker 1: Turnout high means very bad if you're a backwards Neanderthal.

19
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:41,479
Speaker 0: If your party is the party of white supremacy- Most people aren't.

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,656
Speaker 0: And seriously, I've never had to wait in line to vote in all the years I've lived in New York City.

21
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,100
Speaker 1: I've never had to wait and vote for my entire life, and that includes today.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,840
Speaker 1: I went to the polling place I've been to for eight years.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,400
Speaker 1: It's the eighth time I've been there, this public school, and I go- You don't vote in the primaries?

24
00:01:58,866 --> 00:01:59,077
Speaker 1: No.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,055
Speaker 0: You really should.

26
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:00,860
Speaker 1: Whatever.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
Speaker 0: You could've voted for Zephyr Teachout.

28
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:03,540
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

29
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,820
Speaker 1: I couldn't have because I'm not registered to vote.

30
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:06,700
Speaker 0: You're not a Democrat?

31
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,179
Speaker 0: If you live in New York and you're not a Democrat, that's just dumb.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,780
Speaker 1: I'm a nothing.

33
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:10,800
Speaker 0: You should be a Democrat.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,740
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,640
Speaker 0: It's worth it because voting in the primaries is all that matters for the local stuff.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:24,600
Speaker 1: I go to the school to vote, and there's a little line at the door to get into the elementary school gymnasium.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,540
Speaker 1: It's always fun to go in the elementary school gymnasium because when I was in school- They felt so big, right?

38
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:31,039
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

39
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,497
Speaker 1: When I was in school, in elementary school, our elementary school used to be the middle school.

40
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:39,539
Speaker 1: The gym was enormous, especially if you're an elementary school kid, right?

41
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:45,360
Speaker 1: And then the middle school I went to used to be the high school, so I always had a real full-size gymnasium.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,399
Speaker 1: I was never in a elementary school gymnasium in a building that was made to be an elementary school until I voted at this place.

43
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,314
Speaker 1: It's like P.S.

44
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:55,680
Speaker 1: something.

45
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:58,259
Speaker 1: It's an elementary school gym.

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,600
Speaker 1: It's a gym with a basketball court, and it's not small.

47
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,879
Speaker 1: It's not really tiny, but it's like, "Man, I could just dunk in there," and I'm 5'11" and I cannot jump.

48
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:09,220
Speaker 0: We're also in a school.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,919
Speaker 0: We're like the newcomer's high school over here.

50
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:12,420
Speaker 1: Oh, that's where you're going.

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,117
Speaker 1: That's big, though.

52
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:14,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's big.

53
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,558
Speaker 1: That's real big.

54
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:20,959
Speaker 0: The voting always happens in an auditorium that has all these old chairs in it, like these antique-looking chairs.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,180
Speaker 1: All the chairs were full.

56
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,239
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of room in that auditorium for people unless they're sitting in chairs.

57
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,858
Speaker 1: They don't use the gym or whatever?

58
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:28,298
Speaker 1: Nope.

59
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:33,360
Speaker 0: So, I think it's because this room has a lot of direct-to-the-outside access.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,280
Speaker 1: Are you voting on the stage or something?

61
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:36,899
Speaker 0: Just about.

62
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:37,414
Speaker 1: Okay.

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,374
Speaker 0: So, Emily and I show up way early in the morning, and there is a crazy line of people inside.

64
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:57,078
Speaker 0: Two districts vote in that place, and there's two crazy lines that are overflowing and filling up the seats, and apparently because of Fire Code, they can't have people standing behind the seats.

65
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:58,299
Speaker 0: So, people had to sit.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:19,180
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, having been a PACS enforcer, having done convention, like back-end stuff for a long time, I have a pretty good idea of how lines work in general, but one thing that you have to realize is that when you work at even a shittily-run convention, you're dealing with people who at least understand the concept of a line.

67
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:24,520
Speaker 0: When you're dealing with the general public, all bets are off, and they did not have enough polling workers.

68
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,720
Speaker 0: They basically had one person.

69
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:26,859
Speaker 1: You could have been a polling worker.

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,856
Speaker 0: I had to go to work.

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:39,579
Speaker 0: There is one person whose job was to manage both of these lines, and they couldn't have people standing, so Emily actually was explaining to her how to do the pod bays, because it was going crazy.

72
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 0: People were yelling at each other.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,900
Speaker 0: There was bad feelings and a bad situation brewing in there.

74
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:45,940
Speaker 0: It was early.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Speaker 1: People were yelling at each other because of line waiting?

76
00:04:48,261 --> 00:05:00,100
Speaker 0: It was mostly old men claiming that people cut in front of them, or she'd come and yell at everyone to sit down but wouldn't explain where or how to sit down or how to get back in the line, so it just turned into this giant mob.

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,060
Speaker 0: Emily started explaining to the poll worker how to do the pod bay doors.

78
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:04,779
Speaker 1: That's not helping.

79
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:05,597
Speaker 0: Actually, it did.

80
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:08,280
Speaker 0: She did the pod bay doors, and it started working okay.

81
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,319
Speaker 0: The only problem was she needed more people.

82
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,400
Speaker 0: It looks like they eventually called the cops, and then a whole bunch of cops came and started managing the line inside.

83
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,420
Speaker 0: We were there a long goddamn time.

84
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,519
Speaker 0: I was way late to work.

85
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:24,280
Speaker 1: I showed up, and for the first ... I've never had a line at this place ever in my life.

86
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:34,559
Speaker 1: I've always walked into a mostly empty room with a few old people, signed my signature in a book next to an older signature of mine, and then filled out a bubble sheet and shoved it in a machine and went to work.

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,780
Speaker 0: Oh shit, a bunch of people were shot at a voting place.

88
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,219
Speaker 0: That's what people are talking about.

89
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:39,800
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

90
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:40,745
Speaker 0: In ... Okay.

91
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,199
Speaker 1: Some crazy place.

92
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:44,479
Speaker 0: Wow.

93
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:45,320
Speaker 1: Anyway.

94
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,996
Speaker 0: In Azusa.

95
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,659
Speaker 1: I don't know where the fuck that is.

96
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,159
Speaker 1: Alaska?

97
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,059
Speaker 0: LA Times.

98
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,280
Speaker 0: LA Times.

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,500
Speaker 0: This doesn't tell me where.

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,514
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I go in there, and there's a little tiny line to actually get in the gym, and I'm like, "Oh, all

101
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:57,737
Speaker 1: right.".

102
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:04,740
Speaker 1: I'm expecting when I turn the little corner and go in the gym that it's going to be that old big empty room that I've been in seven times before.

103
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:10,719
Speaker 1: I turn the corner, look in the gym, and there's a whole bunch of people in a bunch of lines, and I'm like, "What's going on?

104
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,038
Speaker 1: I've never seen this many people in this voting here in my whole

105
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:14,279
Speaker 1: life.".

106
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:18,180
Speaker 1: I go and I look for my district, because it's like a table for each district.

107
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:30,978
Speaker 1: You have to sign your name in the book, and then they give you your ballot to go fill out, and I go, and there's a big long line for the first table, and a big long line for the second table, and a big long line for the third table, like all the way across the other side of the gym.

108
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,895
Speaker 0: But the fourth one was just fine.

109
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,759
Speaker 1: The fourth table, Scott's table, like three people.

110
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:41,140
Speaker 1: We go sign, sign, sign, ballot, ballot, ballot, shoved it in the machine, went to work.

111
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,720
Speaker 1: No problem.

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,773
Speaker 1: So the moral of the story is be me.

113
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,799
Speaker 1: My computers always work.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Speaker 1: I don't have to wait in line for voting.

115
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:47,980
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

116
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:48,438
Speaker 0: It is.

117
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,960
Speaker 0: You live in a district where either nobody votes or nobody wakes up in the morning.

118
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,918
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, just be me.

119
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,100
Speaker 1: My advice is still correct.

120
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:07,118
Speaker 0: As best as I can tell what's going on, there's a heavily armed dude who shot a bunch of people near a polling place and is still on the loose, so that might mess up some election results in wherever this is.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Speaker 1: Do the people vote already?

122
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:09,959
Speaker 0: No, voting's still open.

123
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,280
Speaker 1: I mean, do the people he shot vote already?

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Speaker 0: It's not clear.

125
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,580
Speaker 0: This is literally like just happened.

126
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:23,020
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what, even though I live in New York and my vote really doesn't matter very much, if someone shot me at a voting place, I'd like crawl in to finish my ballot.

127
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,320
Speaker 1: If somebody shot me when I was still voting, that ballot is going in the machine before I go to the hospital.

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,859
Speaker 0: So someone tweeted something and I know, and it was just an interesting thing and they were like, how do the astronauts vote?

129
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,520
Speaker 0: And there was a process for that.

130
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,040
Speaker 1: I've read about that story four years ago and I read that story eight years ago.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,870
Speaker 1: I feel like I also read that story 12 and 16 years ago.

132
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:45,879
Speaker 1: I think I've heard that story enough times.

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,200
Speaker 0: All right, how do astronauts vote?

134
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,040
Speaker 1: Well, they fill out this thing before they go in space.

135
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,358
Speaker 1: It's like the absentee space voting thingy.

136
00:07:53,601 --> 00:08:05,760
Speaker 1: And then they basically, if there's a delivery that goes at a good time and the ballot's already figured out, they'll include a ballot in there for them.

137
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,737
Speaker 1: But otherwise, they just vote digitally and sign a thing and affirm over the space telephone who they're voting for.

138
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,260
Speaker 0: This was just a regular mass shooting.

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
Speaker 0: It wasn't specifically targeting the polls.

140
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,180
Speaker 0: It just was like right next to the poll, apparently.

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,760
Speaker 1: But was it a crazy person who is politically motivated?

142
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,620
Speaker 0: No, it looks like it looks like a run of the mill mass shooting in America.

143
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,738
Speaker 1: You don't say.

144
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,280
Speaker 1: Looks like a typical day when people are craziest.

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,700
Speaker 1: Some crazy person got even crazier than you.

146
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,298
Speaker 0: There's so many mass shootings in the US that odds were there was going to be one somewhere in the US today.

147
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:40,479
Speaker 0: So that appears to be it.

148
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:41,480
Speaker 0: We'll see.

149
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,676
Speaker 0: We're not reporting on this because I'm going on Twitter and an L.A.

150
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,139
Speaker 0: Times article that is not that up to date.

151
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,794
Speaker 1: That's not.

152
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,799
Speaker 1: We don't report on those even when we have.

153
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:52,914
Speaker 0: Don't come to us for news.

154
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,960
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that by the time you listen to this, you'll already know what happened.

155
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,220
Speaker 1: You shouldn't even bother mentioning because what's the point?

156
00:08:58,421 --> 00:08:59,859
Speaker 0: I was just really interested in what's going on there.

157
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,040
Speaker 1: It's not very interesting.

158
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,880
Speaker 0: I could have been really interesting.

159
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Speaker 1: By spreading that kind of reporting on the kind of information, it makes it happen more.

160
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,240
Speaker 0: There's actually no evidence of that.

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,740
Speaker 1: There's evidence.

162
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:11,080
Speaker 0: No, there's not.

163
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,600
Speaker 0: Are you saying that we should have censorship of the press?

164
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,759
Speaker 1: No, I'm not.

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,920
Speaker 0: So what are you saying then?

166
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:17,880
Speaker 0: What are you saying?

167
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:18,718
Speaker 1: I'm saying that.

168
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,084
Speaker 0: Mr.

169
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:19,880
Speaker 0: doesn't vote in primaries.

170
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,320
Speaker 1: The government shouldn't say press don't report on mass shootings, right?

171
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,540
Speaker 1: Because that'll make more of them.

172
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,499
Speaker 0: So you just want to have a giant press conspiracy to not report on a significant problem that happens in the US?

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,019
Speaker 0: Because then the narrative would be, well, there aren't mass shootings, so I guess we don't need to regulate guns.

174
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,940
Speaker 1: No, that's not should be the narrative either.

175
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,265
Speaker 1: The narrative should be they try to report on mass shootings and nobody watches that bullshit and this.

176
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,459
Speaker 1: they don't get ratings for it, so they stop reporting on it.

177
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,678
Speaker 0: That's not how that's going to work.

178
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,534
Speaker 1: That's you know, I do my part by not paying attention to the shitty news to discourage them from.

179
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,039
Speaker 1: No, you just disengage it.

180
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,954
Speaker 0: There was a young Scott Rubin, 2005, who talked endlessly about Barack Obama and how excited he was.

181
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,599
Speaker 1: That Scott became a smarter Scott.

182
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:17,820
Speaker 1: If you in fact, if you did not grow and learn and become a better person on the radio, the same shitty person he was in the year 2000, whatever you can, Scott is now an adult and rim is still some college kid, some dumb ass.

183
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:31,459
Speaker 0: But if you listen to the geek nights, Patreon with the beta episodes, you can hear Scott being so excited about Obama and talking about Scott, new specific shit about Tom delay and indictment hearings.

184
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
Speaker 1: I know specifically shit now.

185
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
Speaker 1: I just don't talk about it because I don't think, you know, specific shit anymore.

186
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,460
Speaker 1: I know more than, you know, I don't think you do pay attention to the shit that matters and not some mass shootings.

187
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,920
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you're worried about staying up late, the polls in Florida close real soon.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,718
Speaker 0: And basically if any one of those states like Ohio or Florida goes Clinton, you just go to bed because it's over.

189
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,140
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't matter.

190
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,658
Speaker 0: There's almost no way he can win after that.

191
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:02,799
Speaker 0: So you can go to sleep, wake up in the morning and not panic all night waiting for like Iowa's last district to report its last ballot or whatever.

192
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,151
Speaker 0: So anyway, I got any gaming news is like this weekend.

193
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:07,954
Speaker 1: for some reason.

194
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:19,620
Speaker 1: this past weekend, which I guess is like the first weekend in November or second weekend, I remember whatever every year for the past few years has turned into like the gaming extravaganza weekend.

195
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:34,960
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is, but this weekend has the fantasy flight games world championship, which if you don't know is when you've got the net runner world championship, the X wing world championship and a bunch of other games, no one gives a fuck about at the same, they're made by the same company, right?

196
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,480
Speaker 1: It's also Blizzcon for some reason has been on the same weekend this many years in a row.

197
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,939
Speaker 0: I was watching the overwatch championships at work.

198
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,239
Speaker 1: You get your overwatch championship, your hearthstone championship, you know, all the blizzard games.

199
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:48,960
Speaker 1: And also because it's Blizzcon, all the blizzard news.

200
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,120
Speaker 1: So we got tons of news to talk about blizzard stuff.

201
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:51,979
Speaker 1: Right.

202
00:11:52,420 --> 00:12:00,000
Speaker 1: And also this year it happened to also be PAX Australia, which we didn't go to, but which meant that I could stay home and watching Twitch.

203
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,660
Speaker 1: I was actually two windowing, three windowing Twitch at some times.

204
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:04,439
Speaker 1: It's so sad though.

205
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,097
Speaker 1: I didn't have to really go to three windows too often because of the time zones of PAX Aus.

206
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:13,355
Speaker 1: PAX Aus didn't really conflict with the Blizzcon and the fantasy flight stuff, which are in the US.

207
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,640
Speaker 0: It's so weird not being in a PAX because we go to all the PAXs and until now I had, I've been to one more PAX in Scott.

208
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,299
Speaker 0: So I went to two of the PAX Australia's.

209
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,380
Speaker 1: I only went to the first one.

210
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,540
Speaker 0: This year, just being at home and then seeing those tweets, like I'm on my way to PAX.

211
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,598
Speaker 0: Hey guys.

212
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,480
Speaker 1: Cookie Brigade tweets are the worst ones.

213
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,220
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

214
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,400
Speaker 1: It's like, hey guys, come to tabletop and get cookies.

215
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,159
Speaker 1: And usually when I see that tweet, I'm very soon after eating the cookie.

216
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,140
Speaker 1: And that time I didn't get a cookie.

217
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,020
Speaker 1: Like days after I saw that tweet.

218
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,400
Speaker 0: You're like, go outside and try to buy a cookie at whatever deli's open.

219
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,680
Speaker 1: It's not shaped like a mushroom.

220
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:53,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

221
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:53,800
Speaker 0: It's weird.

222
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,820
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure going to PAX Aus next year, we'll see what happens, but anyway, uh, so tons of stuff happens.

223
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,679
Speaker 1: So let's go down the list of most important things.

224
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,700
Speaker 0: The most, most important thing is actually just, well, a news about, you know, related to all these overwatch championships and all this nonsense.

225
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,418
Speaker 1: What is that news?

226
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,777
Speaker 0: Blizzard is going to have a professional, a professional overwatch league, which is not news.

227
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,500
Speaker 1: That's like, of course, I'm surprised it doesn't already exist.

228
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:20,918
Speaker 1: Already.

229
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,659
Speaker 0: They're not going to use all the, all the existing traditional kind of bullshitty ways that these leagues go together.

230
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:32,280
Speaker 0: They're going to have permanent city based teams, real goddamn adult sport.

231
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,720
Speaker 1: Let me tell you what I'd have never played overwatch even one second.

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,327
Speaker 1: I have only really showed like.

233
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:39,800
Speaker 1: you would actually only know what it looks like.

234
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,319
Speaker 1: Barely.

235
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,318
Speaker 1: I don't even know how to play.

236
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:48,559
Speaker 1: But if you tell me, if you tell me that the New York fuckers doesn't even need to be at the garden.

237
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,960
Speaker 0: The New York fuck sores are playing against the bar play center, the Washington butt faces.

238
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:58,040
Speaker 1: If there's the New York city somethings and they're playing overwatch, right?

239
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,979
Speaker 1: Whatever their team name is, as long as it's not like, you know, racist, right?

240
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:07,539
Speaker 1: I'm buying season fucking tickets and learning at least how to watch overwatch.

241
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:07,970
Speaker 0: Yup.

242
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,839
Speaker 0: So it's got literally, it's just like buying a Jersey factory.

243
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,720
Speaker 0: It's kept its CTF just good.

244
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:21,200
Speaker 1: Like it's just, yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I could figure it out in like five minutes, but I, you know, to enjoy watching it, I had to learn some specific stuff though.

245
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,560
Speaker 1: Like, Oh shit, he went and picked that character.

246
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:23,933
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

247
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:24,628
Speaker 0: Yeah.

248
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,619
Speaker 0: He picked me.

249
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

250
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,220
Speaker 0: He just released a new character, which is fucking me up.

251
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,777
Speaker 1: But I mean, that's not any different than like watching a hockey game and being like offsides.

252
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:33,135
Speaker 0: Yup.

253
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:33,636
Speaker 0: Yup.

254
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:34,458
Speaker 0: There goes Vessi.

255
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,040
Speaker 1: It'll take me probably 10 minutes.

256
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,379
Speaker 0: Like knowing who Vessi is.

257
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,260
Speaker 1: And hopefully they will play some other games too, because that would make it even better to go watch.

258
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:51,739
Speaker 1: Cause like if I could go down there after work, you know, my season ticket and watch the New York, whatever they are, is play like some overwatch and then play some kind of strike and then play some something else.

259
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,060
Speaker 0: But there's a much more important thing.

260
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,559
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a, for real professionalization of esports, they're going to launch Q3 of.

261
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:05,539
Speaker 0: So they got, they're setting all this up, but city-based teams does something that we haven't seen hitherto in that.

262
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,039
Speaker 1: Makes me actually care about the team.

263
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:16,940
Speaker 0: City-based teams imply local city-based infrastructure imply normalizing problems that plague other formats like lag and regional stuff.

264
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:26,120
Speaker 0: I mean like the way hockey works is you mostly play people in your local region and then you occasionally go out and do away games far away and like sort of cross.

265
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,860
Speaker 1: They're going to have, they're going to have divisions like, Oh, we won the division.

266
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,719
Speaker 1: We made the playoffs.

267
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:30,420
Speaker 1: All right.

268
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:43,220
Speaker 0: But they also, this article, at least that I found, talked a lot about how most other, most people either use a complicated fan nonsense system or a grind system, or they do use a relegation system, which the article points out.

269
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Speaker 1: Relegation systems are okay.

270
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 1: It works for English soccer.

271
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:59,940
Speaker 0: So I never thought about that much, but this article makes a pretty good point that in general, outside of the very specific soccer fandom in specific parts of the world, relegation systems confuse people and turn them away from sports.

272
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:06,480
Speaker 0: And if they become fans of a team that gets knocked out of the league, they usually don't attach to another team.

273
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,118
Speaker 0: They're just done.

274
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:11,880
Speaker 1: Well, the thing, the reason the relegation system works in English soccer is number one.

275
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:31,460
Speaker 1: in the premier league, there are certain teams that have so much money and are so good it, even though they theoretically like arsenal could theoretically be relegated if they really stunk it up for a bunch of years in a row or something, I don't know the exact, how bad you have to be to be relegated, but it's theoretically possible that some enormous team could be relegated if they really shit, right?

276
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:36,138
Speaker 1: But that will never happen because they have so much money and good players just keep playing for them.

277
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:36,432
Speaker 1: Right.

278
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,520
Speaker 0: Quote, while relegation and promotion make for good drama, they also lead to instability that can frustrate or scare away team owners.

279
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,155
Speaker 1: Yes.

280
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:56,059
Speaker 1: That's the thing is that, you know, that if you own, like, are you going to buy, uh, you know, buy the New York Rangers, like the Cleveland Browns, if there's a relegation in the NFL would have been relegated already.

281
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:56,420
Speaker 1: Right.

282
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,840
Speaker 1: These Philadelphia 76ers would have been relegated, but they have this huge history.

283
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,180
Speaker 1: So it's like, you don't want to buy a, you know, Philadelphia 76ers, if they could be relegated.

284
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,094
Speaker 0: Right.

285
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:18,973
Speaker 0: But this also means there will be e-sports related, legit careers in a bunch of cities, as opposed to concentrated in the few areas where e-sports is run.

286
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:21,900
Speaker 0: now, you don't have to work for Blizzard anymore.

287
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,438
Speaker 0: Well, maybe you will, cause they're running the league, but you could work for the New York Fox.

288
00:17:26,761 --> 00:17:28,789
Speaker 1: I hope that the league is a league.

289
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:37,880
Speaker 1: the same way, like the NFL is a league, technically a nonprofit, but it's really just a, an organization that exists at behest of the team owners.

290
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:43,432
Speaker 1: And then I could go work, I could go to get a job for the New York e-sport team, whatever it is.

291
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,180
Speaker 1: Right.

292
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:53,399
Speaker 1: Like I, you know, a team like that, there are so many jobs to be had from usher and hot dog guy at the arena, which you actually work for the arena then.

293
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:59,460
Speaker 1: But like for the team, there's so many jobs as trainers, there's coaches, there's tech.

294
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,016
Speaker 1: people is, is, you know, marketing, think about Seinfeld, right?

295
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:14,780
Speaker 1: George Costanza's job with, you know, there's the social media, there's like just, you have an enormous number of people that work for a team and I would totally apply it to get a job.

296
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,739
Speaker 0: I am all about this.

297
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,059
Speaker 1: I don't even care what the job is.

298
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,117
Speaker 1: I'll be the hot dog guy.

299
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:29,100
Speaker 0: The other thing that's very interesting, you know, you can be the cheer, you can be the mascot.

300
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,439
Speaker 0: So I'll be cosplayers with this game.

301
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,719
Speaker 1: Hopefully that'd be great.

302
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,960
Speaker 1: But there's, you can go get the Statue of Liberty guy from a time of score.

303
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:45,300
Speaker 0: The other way they're going to depart from most of these other e-sports is that there's going to be a season and there's going to be a lengthy off season just like real sports.

304
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:54,340
Speaker 0: And apparently that was based off feedback from, uh, the industry, the players, potential owners, pretty much everyone was like, yeah, we need an off season.

305
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,796
Speaker 0: Jesus.

306
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,154
Speaker 1: Right.

307
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:04,779
Speaker 1: I mean the, the, we talked recently about the MBA owners that bought, you know, e-sports teams and they're basically like, yeah, that's what they're doing too with their lol or whatever games they're playing.

308
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:06,659
Speaker 0: Oh, this is a really good quote.

309
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,400
Speaker 0: Nobody talks about what the prize pool is for the world cup or the super bowl.

310
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:12,139
Speaker 1: That's right.

311
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,507
Speaker 1: Yeah.

312
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:20,579
Speaker 0: So Blizzard continues to be like the, just on the bleeding edge of doing all this stuff the right way.

313
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:24,140
Speaker 0: And it's interesting that this, they're only doing this for Overwatch.

314
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,700
Speaker 0: Like they're still running heroes of the storm with a promotion relegation system.

315
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,100
Speaker 0: Like every one of their e-sports is run completely differently.

316
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:35,760
Speaker 1: They're going to, they're going to obviously going to try this out, see if it works best.

317
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,880
Speaker 1: And if so, they're probably going to move everything over.

318
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,920
Speaker 0: I don't know if they'll move everything.

319
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,440
Speaker 0: I feel like some of them like Hearthstone probably works well the way it is now because Hearthstone is an individual game.

320
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,460
Speaker 1: So I feel like you want to manage that the way you manage tennis or golf.

321
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,480
Speaker 1: You don't want to, it's not a team thing, right?

322
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,173
Speaker 1: You don't have owners in golf, right?

323
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,720
Speaker 1: You're just an individual with your own sponsors and your own, you know, or thing.

324
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:06,997
Speaker 0: But anyway, rather than try to tell you all the pertinent details, I'm going to link to this polygon article that is probably the best in-depth look at what they're actually doing.

325
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,720
Speaker 0: But this is the biggest gaming news of like the decade.

326
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,000
Speaker 1: Other minor e-sport news.

327
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,760
Speaker 1: There was a low event.

328
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,680
Speaker 1: And at the low event was basically they took the top ranked ladder players.

329
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,079
Speaker 1: So not pro players, just people sitting at home playing, but the best ones.

330
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:26,618
Speaker 1: And they brought them to an event to play with pros to see if they were good enough to be pros.

331
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,860
Speaker 1: And there's a list of requirements they had to meet.

332
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,999
Speaker 1: And if they met them, they would be pros then.

333
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,219
Speaker 1: You know, teams could draft.

334
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,680
Speaker 1: It was like an NFL combine kind of deal, right?

335
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,800
Speaker 1: Or a draft sort of thing.

336
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,974
Speaker 1: And the best player there is North America.

337
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:41,320
Speaker 1: only because North America is weak.

338
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 1: So it needed the help is North America thing, the best player there.

339
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,160
Speaker 1: He was a player who played a role on the team that is like a desperately needed role.

340
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,300
Speaker 1: Like no one plays that role.

341
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:53,200
Speaker 1: Like, man, we really need a running back.

342
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,159
Speaker 1: And he is a running back.

343
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,160
Speaker 1: It's like, oh shit, there are not a lot of running backs.

344
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Speaker 1: We got one in Overwatch.

345
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,540
Speaker 0: You need one really good Genji, right?

346
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,540
Speaker 1: So he's like the number one guy at that.

347
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,600
Speaker 1: And he was the number one overall.

348
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:05,718
Speaker 1: He was like, so good.

349
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:07,700
Speaker 1: And they're like, oh man, we want to sign you up.

350
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,540
Speaker 1: But the last requirement was basically you have to have a good behavior record, no shitheads.

351
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:14,259
Speaker 1: And they looked at his low history.

352
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,880
Speaker 1: Turns out he was a toxic player piece of shit.

353
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:19,660
Speaker 1: So they said, go fuck yourself.

354
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,000
Speaker 1: If you can't play, even though you were like the best, get lost.

355
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:24,059
Speaker 1: And that's awesome.

356
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:27,940
Speaker 1: I think like even the real, the real sports, right?

357
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,800
Speaker 1: It's like plenty of shitheads in the NFL, NHL, NBA, Major League Baseball.

358
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,779
Speaker 1: And they get to, even if they do something really awful, like go to jail for dogfighting, Michael Vick.

359
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,400
Speaker 1: They let him come right back afterwards.

360
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,260
Speaker 0: Imagine if the NFL was like, no domestic violence charges, you're done.

361
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,840
Speaker 1: And it's like, while I agree that, you know, it's like you served your time, you should be allowed back into society.

362
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaker 1: I don't agree with that box, like on job applications, like have you ever been a felon, right?

363
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,216
Speaker 1: There are certain things you should not be able to do, right?

364
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,540
Speaker 1: Like be a public figure, celebrity type person.

365
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:10,519
Speaker 1: You should just be like, okay, you can have a life, but you can't be rich, famous celebrity because you're a scumbag.

366
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,658
Speaker 0: We're not going to let you do that.

367
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,340
Speaker 1: Well, I suspect, I'm not a lawyer, that's not legal advice, that- Especially not in a position where like you are a role model, public figure type thing.

368
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:27,197
Speaker 0: If your job involves being a celebrity effectively, pretty sure you can discriminate based on public opinion of you.

369
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,153
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.

370
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,400
Speaker 0: And Blizzard has been like, I report people, like if someone says anything even close to being racist in any Overwatch game, I just report them immediately.

371
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,940
Speaker 0: And I tell them I report them and they usually get mad and say more report worthy things.

372
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,459
Speaker 0: And everyone else on the team will usually also report them.

373
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,880
Speaker 0: It looks like they just fucking take your game away, ban you from Overwatch for life.

374
00:22:48,982 --> 00:22:50,220
Speaker 0: Like they do not fuck around.

375
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,260
Speaker 1: Like if I was hiring someone to be a software developer- I look at their Twitter.

376
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
Speaker 0: And it turned out that they were like- I see some Pepe the Froyo over at Twitter.

377
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,860
Speaker 1: Well, no, let's say it turned out that they like, they killed somebody.

378
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,740
Speaker 1: Like they're a felon, but they got out of jail.

379
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:03,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

380
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,200
Speaker 1: Like I talked to their probation officer and I, you know, I just checked it out.

381
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,819
Speaker 1: I'm not, you know, I didn't, I didn't put the checkbox on the job application, but I'm still doing a background check because that's how I do, right?

382
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:18,700
Speaker 1: And I just find this out, but I interview them and they're a stable individual.

383
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:26,439
Speaker 1: And, you know, like, and if they know their shit and they're better than the other applicants that know when they're shit for this job, I'm gonna hire them.

384
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:38,940
Speaker 1: But if that job is say, I don't know, uh, to be like my developer relations person who has to go around, you know, talking to people, I'm like, yeah, murder.

385
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,340
Speaker 1: Can't have that job, right?

386
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,520
Speaker 1: To the face of my company.

387
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:42,060
Speaker 1: Right.

388
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:44,560
Speaker 1: But you can totally have a high paying job writing code.

389
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,132
Speaker 1: I don't care.

390
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:49,300
Speaker 1: Uh, tons of other news is going around a lot.

391
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,940
Speaker 0: I mean, I watched the overall championships.

392
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,299
Speaker 0: It was just kind of amazing.

393
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:55,200
Speaker 0: Uh, the commentation was pretty pro packs.

394
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:55,617
Speaker 1: Awesome.

395
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,920
Speaker 1: Megathon finale was basically VR, wild west dueling of some kind.

396
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,780
Speaker 1: From what I could tell, uh, I didn't actually see what game it was specifically.

397
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,460
Speaker 0: I just, but it was a notable megathon for a reason that I've, I've been, every year I root for this to happen.

398
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:10,820
Speaker 0: And this is the first time it happened.

399
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,840
Speaker 1: Not only was it too, we've been predicting VR for a while.

400
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:20,900
Speaker 0: But not only was it two women in the omega finale, but a woman who won the omega finale, it took long enough.

401
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:21,457
Speaker 0: Yup.

402
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,740
Speaker 0: I'm very happy with that outcome.

403
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
Speaker 0: I haven't actually watched the omega yet.

404
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,520
Speaker 1: I just saw screenshots.

405
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,620
Speaker 1: I didn't see in photos.

406
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,360
Speaker 1: I didn't watch the video of it or figure out any of that stuff.

407
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,700
Speaker 0: What sucks is I was literally in Australia and came home like a week before packs.

408
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,500
Speaker 1: The person who won the net runner world championship last year and the year before did not win it this year.

409
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,458
Speaker 1: They didn't even make the cut.

410
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:45,300
Speaker 1: Uh, so, so I watched, but I mean, if you care about net runner, you're just going to get all the info on your own.

411
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,540
Speaker 1: You don't need to meet to waste podcast time on that.

412
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:47,763
Speaker 0: Yeah.

413
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:48,759
Speaker 0: Don't get news from us.

414
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,440
Speaker 0: Get commentary.

415
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,180
Speaker 1: It's a good time to play net runners though.

416
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,680
Speaker 1: There's going to be rotation like pretty soon and new cards are coming that are exciting and old cards are going to go away.

417
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Speaker 1: So we're going to like reach the limit.

418
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,080
Speaker 1: We're like, this is the amount of money it costs to buy all net runner cards period.

419
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:07,039
Speaker 1: And that number won't really go up ever again once we hit that rotation time.

420
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:11,620
Speaker 1: And I hear there, there's a rumor they're also going to redo the core set a little bit.

421
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:15,920
Speaker 1: So, and that should really help make the game a lot better.

422
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,800
Speaker 0: So, so I watch the, uh, wow.

423
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,200
Speaker 0: Arena championship stuff they were doing.

424
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,438
Speaker 0: It was like this pregame thing.

425
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:24,999
Speaker 1: Uh, that's like, I didn't even, why did they even do that?

426
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,980
Speaker 1: I was just, why is that even a thing?

427
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,391
Speaker 0: Because I watched a lot of their other streams and heroes of the storm and, uh, Overwatch.

428
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,539
Speaker 0: The commutation was pretty good and that should be it.

429
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:36,159
Speaker 0: Like games.

430
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,003
Speaker 0: I don't know that well.

431
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:40,600
Speaker 0: at good commentary and games I knew that well, like also had good commentary.

432
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,738
Speaker 0: But the commutation on wow.

433
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,740
Speaker 0: Arena was nothing but made up words.

434
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,319
Speaker 0: I could not tell.

435
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,119
Speaker 0: I like, they kept saying this word that I assumed was the name of one of the players, but then it was not.

436
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:57,179
Speaker 0: And I couldn't figure out what the fuck they were talking about.

437
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:58,819
Speaker 0: And it's like, you couldn't follow it.

438
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,860
Speaker 0: Like I, that is the opposite of an e-sport that thing.

439
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,240
Speaker 1: The Hearthstone commentary is actually really, really good.

440
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,620
Speaker 1: The only problem with it is that if you don't know the names of cards, it will sound like gobbledygook.

441
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:11,640
Speaker 1: It's like, other than that, it's like, they're speaking perfect English.

442
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,780
Speaker 1: It's just, they referred to cards by name.

443
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,620
Speaker 1: Like, oh no, he's playing Ragnaros the Firelord.

444
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:17,358
Speaker 1: What's going to happen?

445
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,000
Speaker 1: They don't, occasionally someone will say, ah, this is what Ragnaros the Firelord does, but not frequently.

446
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,359
Speaker 1: Right.

447
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,660
Speaker 0: But that's about the level I want.

448
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,980
Speaker 0: Cause I feel like if I'm, well, really, I feel like the right way to do this in the future.

449
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:35,480
Speaker 0: And I feel like you could do this with traditional sports too, is there's always two commentary tracks.

450
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:35,815
Speaker 1: Yes.

451
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,340
Speaker 0: There's, you can pick between the, I'm a casual viewer of this.

452
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,599
Speaker 0: And I know what's going on.

453
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,019
Speaker 1: And not just English and Spanish.

454
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,529
Speaker 1: Yeah.

455
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:50,340
Speaker 1: But the Netrunner actually, they had, you know, commentary on the Netrunner World Championships from, you know, the FFG staff and some other people.

456
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,100
Speaker 1: And sometimes they had people on there who didn't know the game that well.

457
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:55,080
Speaker 1: And that was annoying.

458
00:26:55,442 --> 00:27:06,880
Speaker 1: And some, and the thing is even the people who did know the game really well, were really trying to talk intentionally, trying to explain everything as if the person watching was a new player, like explaining every card.

459
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:13,317
Speaker 1: It's like, that would be like, if you're watching a hockey game and someone goes offsides and they, you know, it's like, they just say offsides.

460
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,720
Speaker 1: Imagine if they're like offsides.

461
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:19,139
Speaker 1: Ah, that means he went over the blue line before the, I would just beat my face into the wall.

462
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,575
Speaker 1: Exactly.

463
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Speaker 1: So that it's like, imagine if they said that like multiple times, after you would go off with the four check, a four check is when, right.

464
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:30,100
Speaker 1: It's like, you can't do that either.

465
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:30,859
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

466
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,939
Speaker 1: You need to give people some amount of, you know, Puck is a hard wooden object made of rubber.

467
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,860
Speaker 0: Hard rubber objects.

468
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,480
Speaker 1: Oh, he got calls for tripping.

469
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,220
Speaker 1: That means it's just like, oh my God.

470
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,620
Speaker 1: You know, it's like only explain the complicated rules that even someone who knows how to play the game.

471
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,519
Speaker 0: You're only going to have one commentary track.

472
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:53,519
Speaker 0: You do it the way American football does it.

473
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:53,837
Speaker 0: Yeah.

474
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,360
Speaker 0: American football shows you what you think is American football.

475
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,080
Speaker 1: Even people who are football fans, even the kind of football fan who doesn't understand football that much.

476
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,559
Speaker 1: And he's just like the drunken football fan.

477
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:06,360
Speaker 1: Even they like the commentary less.

478
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,600
Speaker 1: John Madden was a big deal.

479
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,680
Speaker 1: And his name is on Madden football because when he would talk, we'd commentate the football games, right?

480
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:23,759
Speaker 1: He would talk about them on a, not, you know, the coaches high, super high level, but in a higher level than every day, people could even think about it.

481
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,820
Speaker 1: He would also be drawn the X's and O's and he'd teach you how the game of football.

482
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:33,080
Speaker 0: He'd reach down to you who don't know that much about football and elevate you a little bit.

483
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:34,558
Speaker 0: He wouldn't just leave you down there.

484
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,040
Speaker 1: No.

485
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,140
Speaker 1: And nowadays you didn't even see anyone using the telestrator anymore.

486
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,840
Speaker 1: The telestrator like does not exist in modern NFL broadcasting whatsoever.

487
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,979
Speaker 1: He brought it, he made it a thing and they got rid of it.

488
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:51,320
Speaker 0: I saw it on a Rangers game the other night talking about lines.

489
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,519
Speaker 1: But the only time they use the telestrator now is if you're watching like NFL network and there's not a game going on.

490
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:02,540
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, a special show where they're talking about like strategies and things.

491
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,539
Speaker 1: You can watch some of those videos on like nfl.com/whatever video or something like that.

492
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,020
Speaker 1: And cause you know, if you don't have NFL network cause you don't pay for cable cause you're a smart person, but during the actual games, they eliminated all of that.

493
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,319
Speaker 1: They've dumbed it down to an extraordinary level and it's not good.

494
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:21,319
Speaker 0: So this is our idea.

495
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,100
Speaker 0: Blizzard, you're doing everything right.

496
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,699
Speaker 0: My suggestion is if you can pull it off two commentary streams for every game.

497
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,298
Speaker 1: Every e-sport do that.

498
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,595
Speaker 0: Every non-sport do that.

499
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,078
Speaker 0: No one else is capable at this point.

500
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:33,939
Speaker 1: Every sport, multiple commentaries to choose from.

501
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:35,980
Speaker 1: And also every sport.

502
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,540
Speaker 1: Let me listen to the radio announcers synchronized on the TV.

503
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:41,719
Speaker 1: I hate your TV announcers.

504
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,680
Speaker 1: They suck except MSG used to be an app that did that, but it doesn't.

505
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,500
Speaker 1: We would delay the radio broadcast.

506
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:54,980
Speaker 1: It would, you know, you take an am radio and it would delay and you could match it up with your TV, but that doesn't work anymore.

507
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:59,460
Speaker 0: But uh, anyway, all the, all the specific news is that we could talk about.

508
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:02,660
Speaker 0: They'll trickle in as we have commentary in the next several episodes of geek nights.

509
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,357
Speaker 0: You can just go read about all this stuff.

510
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,370
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

511
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:20,430
Speaker 0: So if you're not familiar with, uh, Reddit, it has the concept of subreddits and some subreddits, the only reason Reddit works is because it has subreddits.

512
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,270
Speaker 1: You don't have to go to the bad subreddits.

513
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:25,829
Speaker 1: You can just stay in the good parts and ignore the shit parts.

514
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:31,590
Speaker 0: But the interesting thing about subreddits is they get shockingly specific.

515
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:32,350
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

516
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,308
Speaker 1: That's the other reason that they work, right?

517
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,220
Speaker 0: Is like, if you're a fan of say, I don't know, Harry Potter, right?

518
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,041
Speaker 1: Well, you're probably not, if you're like the Harry Potter fanfic writing type, you're probably not going to get along with.

519
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:47,030
Speaker 1: say my brother.

520
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,729
Speaker 1: My brother is a huge Harry Potter fan.

521
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,283
Speaker 1: He was reading Harry Potter before.

522
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:50,849
Speaker 1: it was a thing.

523
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,410
Speaker 1: Right.

524
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:52,188
Speaker 1: And he'll tell you that.

525
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,270
Speaker 1: And he's read every book and seen every movie.

526
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:57,289
Speaker 1: But if you showed him a fan fiction, he'd be like, get the fuck away from me.

527
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,209
Speaker 1: What the fuck is that?

528
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:58,461
Speaker 1: Right.

529
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:01,549
Speaker 1: But you know, he doesn't want to hang out with them.

530
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,589
Speaker 1: So slash R slash Harry Potter is not for him.

531
00:31:04,857 --> 00:31:05,110
Speaker 1: Right.

532
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:06,044
Speaker 1: Or maybe it is.

533
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,829
Speaker 1: And slash R slash Harry fic is for someone else.

534
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:21,369
Speaker 0: So this is a subreddit dedicated solely to not just the Pokemon executor, but the Aeolian version of the Pokemon executor.

535
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,330
Speaker 1: I didn't know there was a different version of exec.

536
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,770
Speaker 0: You haven't looked at the new Pokemon.

537
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,310
Speaker 1: Well, also, executor is a really garbage Pokemon.

538
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:28,944
Speaker 1: Fuck him.

539
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,970
Speaker 0: You know, he's one of the Pokemon I would use because he's great.

540
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,390
Speaker 1: Like execute an executor.

541
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:33,793
Speaker 1: That's like.

542
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:35,610
Speaker 1: that's like one of the worst Pokemon.

543
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,249
Speaker 1: Like, you know, if I was ranking Pokemon, especially like, I mean, it's an old Pokemon to style wise.

544
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:41,770
Speaker 0: They're great.

545
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,770
Speaker 0: The problem is they suck at being Pokemon.

546
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,269
Speaker 1: I don't care when I'm ranking Pokemon.

547
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,210
Speaker 1: I do not care about their effectiveness in pokey battle.

548
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,654
Speaker 0: That is like.

549
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:52,220
Speaker 0: that is not like.

550
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,730
Speaker 1: that is not a concern for me whatsoever.

551
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:59,870
Speaker 1: The only thing that I'm concerned with is their visual appearance and general stylings.

552
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:07,330
Speaker 1: And executor, despite being an old Pokemon, that is much better than, say, many of the modern pile of razorblades.

553
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,044
Speaker 1: Pokemons is probably like the worst Pokemon.

554
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,169
Speaker 1: that isn't a pile of razorblades.

555
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,208
Speaker 0: Executor.

556
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,248
Speaker 0: I think he's a great guy.

557
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:14,837
Speaker 0: Sure.

558
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,310
Speaker 0: Anyway, you have to go look at this subreddit.

559
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,190
Speaker 1: It's pretty good subreddit.

560
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,829
Speaker 0: Like it's not what you're expecting, but in a way it should be what you like.

561
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,310
Speaker 0: When you see it, you'll realize that this is exactly what you should have expected.

562
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:28,810
Speaker 0: And it's going strong.

563
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:29,920
Speaker 1: Nice.

564
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,068
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

565
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,889
Speaker 1: The problem is if you subscribe to the subreddit and get the highest rated posts on your Reddit homepage.

566
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:36,405
Speaker 1: Yeah.

567
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:37,870
Speaker 1: That's not very effective.

568
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,310
Speaker 0: Nope.

569
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,730
Speaker 0: You've got to go to it directly.

570
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:41,067
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

571
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:41,946
Speaker 0: This Arthur one.

572
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:42,647
Speaker 1: Right.

573
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:52,049
Speaker 1: So if you are old like us and you used or saw or knew about AOL back in the day when that was what Internet was.

574
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:53,349
Speaker 0: I never had AOL.

575
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,890
Speaker 0: I use the free CD, the free discs.

576
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,230
Speaker 0: I would sign into AOL online to do bad shit.

577
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,050
Speaker 0: I shouldn't have been doing.

578
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,949
Speaker 1: I would sign into AOL, minimize it and open up Netscape Navigator is a thing you could do anyway.

579
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,770
Speaker 0: Red Prodigy Internet and wow.

580
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,159
Speaker 0: Yeah.

581
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,450
Speaker 1: So you would, uh, you know, when you signed into AOL, you had to open the AOL app, right?

582
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:14,690
Speaker 1: Cause that was how you dialed in.

583
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,950
Speaker 1: You couldn't just dial in with your regular old, you know, modem, you know, you know, TTLs, whatever.

584
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:20,308
Speaker 1: Yeah.

585
00:33:20,854 --> 00:33:22,768
Speaker 1: So it would open up and it would check your AOL email.

586
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:25,070
Speaker 1: And if you had it, you would say welcome.

587
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,890
Speaker 1: And then if you had mail, it would say you've got mail.

588
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:33,050
Speaker 1: And this was such a big cultural phenomenon that there was even like a movie about it.

589
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,569
Speaker 0: And, you know, yeah, that movie real bad.

590
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:36,974
Speaker 1: There's a whole.

591
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:38,804
Speaker 1: it was a big deal back then in the 90s, late 90s.

592
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,250
Speaker 1: And then it disappeared once AOL disappeared.

593
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:46,529
Speaker 1: But, you know, but there's a certain generation of people where that will be a thing for them forever.

594
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:51,690
Speaker 1: And I wonder, were there things like that for even older generations that are now gone?

595
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,149
Speaker 1: I would like to know about them.

596
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:58,170
Speaker 1: Old people, please tell me what is the, you got mail of your generation that has now been lost.

597
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,488
Speaker 0: Probably where's the beef.

598
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,089
Speaker 1: That's I know that one though.

599
00:34:01,276 --> 00:34:01,508
Speaker 1: Yeah.

600
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,229
Speaker 1: Uh, send me your YouTube links.

601
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:08,889
Speaker 1: Uh, anyway, the guy who's the voice actor who said you've got mail, right?

602
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,369
Speaker 1: He's come back into, you know, 15 minutes of fame here.

603
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,097
Speaker 0: Nice John St.

604
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:13,710
Speaker 0: John style.

605
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,170
Speaker 1: You know, every once in a while this guy appears.

606
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:18,650
Speaker 1: He's not like a forgotten sad figure, right?

607
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,299
Speaker 1: He's, you know, he gets his, you know, recurring like, oh, there's that guy again once in a while.

608
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:23,580
Speaker 1: Right.

609
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,010
Speaker 1: He's sort of on the same level as like the guy who does the Mario voices.

610
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:36,770
Speaker 1: But apparently he's getting less work than the guy who does the Mario voices because he is currently at least partial part of the time working, driving an Uber.

611
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:37,909
Speaker 1: I hate Uber.

612
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,449
Speaker 1: I've never ridden in one and I never will because that company is evil.

613
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:48,447
Speaker 1: But someone got in an Uber and this guy was driving it and he was totally happy and chill to say you've got mail for them.

614
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:49,708
Speaker 1: And that's awesome.

615
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:54,168
Speaker 1: So I like this guy, even though he's working for some shit company part of his time.

616
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:54,730
Speaker 1: Yeah.

617
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:56,830
Speaker 0: I'll never blame the people who work for Uber.

618
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,350
Speaker 0: I'll only blame the people who work in corporate.

619
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,244
Speaker 1: I don't blame, listen, I don't even blame people who take Ubers cause there's people who were like, they need Uber.

620
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:10,269
Speaker 0: Like if you were in a place, I blame people who live in New York city and are traveling in the parts of New York city that actually have cabs against Uber.

621
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:16,986
Speaker 1: I've know, for example, disabled people who live in a place where like a cab isn't going to come get them.

622
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,870
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, even Uber gives them trouble.

623
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:25,450
Speaker 1: Like the Uber will say that they'll like handicap accessible and they won't or like they'll see them and drive past and shit.

624
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:25,710
Speaker 1: Right.

625
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,969
Speaker 1: But it's one of the, or I've seen people where like they live in a suburb where cars are a thing.

626
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:31,750
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:33,129
Speaker 1: And they just drive everywhere.

628
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,469
Speaker 1: A cab isn't going to come by their house.

629
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,015
Speaker 1: Right.

630
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:40,090
Speaker 1: And you know, to get a cab to come to your house is like a huge pain in the ass.

631
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:41,450
Speaker 1: The Uber is the best option.

632
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:55,523
Speaker 1: And there'll be a situation where like they need a car because maybe like, you know, they have to, they're going to get a cancer treatment or something and they're going to be mad dizzy and messed up on chemo and they got to get home from the cancer treatment place.

633
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:56,002
Speaker 1: Yeah.

634
00:35:56,312 --> 00:35:57,729
Speaker 1: And there's no, like, that's the best.

635
00:35:58,511 --> 00:36:05,750
Speaker 1: It's amazing that for all these situations like that, you know, a grandma, everything is great about Uber, the founders of the company.

636
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,009
Speaker 1: But the company is just awful and horrendous.

637
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,770
Speaker 0: So I got a second tiny thing of the day.

638
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,250
Speaker 0: This is the best tweet of 2016.

639
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,339
Speaker 1: Okay.

640
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:21,010
Speaker 0: Jill Stein with 0.6% of the vote sticking to her guns and going for a homeopathic victory.

641
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:26,674
Speaker 1: That's a funny joke, but it's not the best tweet of 2016.

642
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:27,469
Speaker 0: Find me a better tweet.

643
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,090
Speaker 1: I'll check my favorite tweets.

644
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,910
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I could find a better one from today.

645
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,070
Speaker 0: There's the guy who brought his rabbit to vote with him.

646
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,648
Speaker 0: That was pretty good.

647
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,408
Speaker 1: That's just cute.

648
00:36:36,556 --> 00:36:38,648
Speaker 1: You mean cute tweets aren't the greatest tweets, right?

649
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:40,770
Speaker 1: Or are they?

650
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:44,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, in the meta moment, the book club book is Rebecca.

651
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,270
Speaker 0: I'm going to read it real soon because I finished that World War II book I was reading.

652
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:50,736
Speaker 0: Are you reading it?

653
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,569
Speaker 0: or if you're not resumed it yet?

654
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:54,430
Speaker 1: Soon.

655
00:36:55,692 --> 00:37:01,349
Speaker 0: I feel like as soon as one of us starts reading it, we're both going to finish it in, like, a couple days and we'll do the book club show.

656
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,070
Speaker 0: Otherwise, check out my YouTube channel and Scott's YouTube channel.

657
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,790
Speaker 0: I've been uploading more and more stuff to the Patreon as I spin it back up.

658
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:24,930
Speaker 0: Now that we're back from Australia, I'm going to continue reading Simon's Quest, Castlevania II, the Worlds of Power novelization by FX9, where it's weirdly sexualized and it's creeping me out as an adult reading this book.

659
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,609
Speaker 0: I worry that all the rest of them are similar.

660
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,390
Speaker 0: If you didn't vote and you live in America, I guess you're a bad person.

661
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,530
Speaker 1: You're over the age of 18.

662
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you could have voted in America and you didn't, probably a bad person.

663
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,450
Speaker 0: Unless you might have an excuse.

664
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,830
Speaker 0: You might have been shot by that guy or whatever, but if not, probably should have voted.

665
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,411
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not saying this is best tweet of 2016.

666
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:50,390
Speaker 1: I just scrolled down through my liked tweets to find a tweet that was better than the one you just mentioned.

667
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:51,030
Speaker 1: All right.

668
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:54,229
Speaker 1: So here's one from nine days ago.

669
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,449
Speaker 1: Someone posted this early in the morning when they had to get up early and it's Sailor Moon pulling the covers overhead in a little gif.

670
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,328
Speaker 0: That's good.

671
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,128
Speaker 0: I know that.

672
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:03,249
Speaker 1: There you go.

673
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:03,546
Speaker 0: Okay.

674
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,024
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

675
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,630
Speaker 1: And right above that is a tweet that's actually text.

676
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,568
Speaker 1: So it's a real tweet.

677
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:16,130
Speaker 1: If Marvel wanted to capture that fading young male audience, they would bring back Ghost Rider, a skeleton, which rides a motorcycle on fire.

678
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:18,770
Speaker 1: And I wholeheartedly agree.

679
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:19,393
Speaker 1: That's pretty much.

680
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:24,529
Speaker 1: the only thing good about Ghost Rider is that he is a skeleton on a motorcycle who is on fire.

681
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:29,083
Speaker 1: And we need more of those because Inferno Cop and Ghost Rider are the only two I know of.

682
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:30,325
Speaker 1: Give me more.

683
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,427
Speaker 1: The end.

684
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:33,670
Speaker 1: All right.

685
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,450
Speaker 1: And don't give me that like human Ghost Rider fighting crime on the streets.

686
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:38,690
Speaker 1: Bullshit, right?

687
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,549
Speaker 1: The real Ghost Rider goes into literal hell.

688
00:38:42,094 --> 00:38:43,430
Speaker 1: It's like a doom situation.

689
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:44,250
Speaker 1: That's the Ghost Rider.

690
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:44,747
Speaker 1: I know.

691
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:45,949
Speaker 1: Exactly.

692
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:50,670
Speaker 1: I got some good Ghost Rider comics that are really best tweets.

693
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,630
Speaker 1: Imagine if Doom Guy was a skeleton on a motorcycle on fire.

694
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,528
Speaker 0: That's the kind of game that when I was in high school, I would have played the shit out of.

695
00:38:59,690 --> 00:38:59,838
Speaker 0: You did.

696
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,849
Speaker 1: It was called Doom.

697
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:03,470
Speaker 0: And Doom 2.

698
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,169
Speaker 1: You just shot rockets at skeleton heads on fire coming at you.

699
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:10,090
Speaker 0: All right.

700
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,170
Speaker 0: So Uwe Rosenberg, we're a fan of his games.

701
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:18,090
Speaker 1: He's a, you know, somewhat legendary board game maker of games like Agricola and such.

702
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,068
Speaker 0: Let's see.

703
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,610
Speaker 0: Agricola, Le Havre, Glass Road, which I haven't played yet.

704
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,448
Speaker 0: Everyone's telling me to play.

705
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:24,268
Speaker 1: Caverna.

706
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,889
Speaker 0: Which I do not enjoy.

707
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:27,189
Speaker 1: You played Caverna?

708
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:28,909
Speaker 0: I learned how to play it.

709
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:29,284
Speaker 1: Caverna.

710
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:29,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

711
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:30,490
Speaker 0: I learned.

712
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,130
Speaker 1: I was taught how to play Caverna.

713
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,110
Speaker 1: Because you don't say I'm going to a cavern.

714
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,670
Speaker 1: Well, you can say I'm going down to the cavern and it's a cavern.

715
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,750
Speaker 0: But you don't, you don't buy a crystal yet.

716
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,310
Speaker 0: The game is called Crystalis.

717
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:43,909
Speaker 1: Some people buy crystal.

718
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,690
Speaker 0: You're going to call it a crystal?

719
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:46,663
Speaker 0: Crystalis?

720
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,227
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

721
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:54,910
Speaker 0: It's not crystal with a K. Anyway, A Feast for Odin is the one that everyone's talking about recently.

722
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,830
Speaker 1: That's a hot new game I haven't played, know nothing about.

723
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:03,920
Speaker 0: Everyone who's mentioned it to me said, quote, I'm paraphrasing all of the things they said together, it's an Uwe Rosenberg game.

724
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,230
Speaker 1: I definitely want to have a feast with my bro Odin.

725
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,409
Speaker 1: There's no question about that.

726
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,210
Speaker 0: I think it's the one that has a really big box.

727
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,429
Speaker 0: Like you were taking pictures of dropping the box on things.

728
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,989
Speaker 0: That might be a heavy box.

729
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,009
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Odin's a hungry man.

730
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:16,546
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:17,508
Speaker 1: A hungry god.

732
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:22,511
Speaker 0: But a possibly overlooked small game that he did in 2014.

733
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:23,130
Speaker 0: It's not overlooked.

734
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:26,309
Speaker 0: I've never actually played it until today.

735
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,845
Speaker 0: I didn't play it until recently.

736
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,510
Speaker 1: So there's a game called Patchwork.

737
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,589
Speaker 1: It's a two player game.

738
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:39,310
Speaker 1: And I knew this game was hot because when I was working in the PAX library multiple years in a row, right, this game would be coming in and out and in and out as soon as it came in and went out.

739
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,390
Speaker 1: People wanted this game.

740
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:47,370
Speaker 1: We only had like one copy, which I think maybe felt like it had a higher demand than it deserved because it was a low supply situation.

741
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:50,510
Speaker 1: If we had more copies, you probably wouldn't have that problem.

742
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,230
Speaker 1: But anyway, two player game.

743
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,109
Speaker 1: I knew it was hot.

744
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,110
Speaker 1: I've seen it in stores.

745
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:59,330
Speaker 1: And recently the iOS app was on super sale, like way discounted.

746
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,004
Speaker 1: So I bought it.

747
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,129
Speaker 1: I learned how to play using the app.

748
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:07,609
Speaker 1: Today, I read the rules PDF, and it turns out the app taught me how to play exactly one hundred percent correctly.

749
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:12,030
Speaker 1: The app has an amazing user interface with very few flaws.

750
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:15,210
Speaker 1: Rim read the rules, which are really short.

751
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,168
Speaker 1: So he learned how to play.

752
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:17,370
Speaker 1: We played twice.

753
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:23,030
Speaker 1: I completely destroyed rim both times because I've been practicing playing this on the app for like a few weeks.

754
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:24,970
Speaker 0: And I literally never played it before.

755
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,989
Speaker 1: And you didn't try very hard.

756
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:32,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I wasn't going to spend the time to really look at all the potential pieces.

757
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:37,070
Speaker 1: But even if you had tried very hard and learned to play, you played it a lot.

758
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,470
Speaker 1: I mean, the margin of victory by which I destroyed you even in the second game was so vast.

759
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:49,525
Speaker 1: I think that, you know, even if you practice this for a while, I would still be better than you.

760
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,610
Speaker 0: I will play this game enough to prove you wrong on that.

761
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,470
Speaker 1: At least I think you could make it close.

762
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,350
Speaker 1: I do not think that you could beat me on any consistent basis.

763
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,310
Speaker 1: There is the tiniest amount.

764
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:07,089
Speaker 1: There's not that much going on in this game of luck in terms of who goes first, which could matter.

765
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:16,710
Speaker 1: And if two players are truly equal, depending on the piece distribution, first player could determine winner in like a small percentage of games.

766
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:17,765
Speaker 1: And that's about it.

767
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:18,630
Speaker 1: Right.

768
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:19,829
Speaker 1: So here's how the game works.

769
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,148
Speaker 1: You're trying to make a quilt.

770
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:27,150
Speaker 1: And the best quilt wins with big old like extended Tetris pieces.

771
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,449
Speaker 1: It's sort of like block is right.

772
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,710
Speaker 1: There's a set of pieces and it's the same set of pieces for every game.

773
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:37,810
Speaker 1: And some pieces are going to go to player one and some pieces are going to end up with player two and some places are going to end up with nobody.

774
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:39,789
Speaker 1: And you're making a quilt.

775
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:41,650
Speaker 1: And at the end of the game, best quilt wins.

776
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:46,488
Speaker 1: And here's how it works on your little board where you make a quilt, which is a nine by nine board.

777
00:42:46,952 --> 00:42:50,630
Speaker 1: Every empty square left at the end of the game is minus two points.

778
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,269
Speaker 1: So it's eighty one nine times nine times two.

779
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,869
Speaker 1: Eighty one times two is one hundred and sixty four hundred sixty two.

780
00:42:57,852 --> 00:43:01,388
Speaker 1: You can have negative one hundred sixty two at the end of the game if you don't put any pieces down.

781
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:02,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not going to happen.

782
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:07,410
Speaker 1: Also, you then get one point for every button you have.

783
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,350
Speaker 1: A button is like this currency and you start with five.

784
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:18,950
Speaker 1: And then as you get a certain number of incomes as the game goes on and the incomes are equal to the number of buttons that are in your quilt already.

785
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,509
Speaker 1: So certain pieces in your quilt have buttons sewn onto them.

786
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:28,307
Speaker 1: And those pieces will generate currency for you every time you pass a currency spot on the track.

787
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,730
Speaker 1: And the track is this timing track.

788
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,870
Speaker 1: So basically that archaeologist game.

789
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:33,250
Speaker 1: Right.

790
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,240
Speaker 1: So the timing track is whenever you add a piece to your quilt, it takes time to sew it on.

791
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:37,741
Speaker 1: Right.

792
00:43:38,172 --> 00:43:39,289
Speaker 1: So you get these hourglasses.

793
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:43,203
Speaker 1: And when you got to the end of the game, right, is.

794
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:46,489
Speaker 1: you spent so many hourglasses that your piece moves off the edge of the boards.

795
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:53,130
Speaker 1: You can think of it as everyone starts the game with X hourglasses and they're a currency that you're spending.

796
00:43:53,631 --> 00:44:00,329
Speaker 1: And as you spend more of them, right, you cross certain checkpoints and does get your income points.

797
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:06,930
Speaker 1: And you're also these little one by one squares that you can get by moving faster than the other player around the track.

798
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:14,729
Speaker 1: So if you spend a lot of time and get high hourglass pieces that you move faster, which is good and also bad.

799
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:22,250
Speaker 0: Which is interesting because the game is it's one of those rare games that has two very different currencies and pretty disparate.

800
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,030
Speaker 0: Like the ranges range from like one hourglass to what's the highest hourglass on that?

801
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:27,904
Speaker 1: I've seen sixes.

802
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:28,485
Speaker 0: Yup.

803
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,410
Speaker 0: And the button costs range from like one to ten.

804
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,370
Speaker 1: There was a zero piece that you can get.

805
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:36,590
Speaker 1: No buttons whatsoever.

806
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:44,590
Speaker 0: So as a result, the game has a lot of sort of play within a very narrow band.

807
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:48,370
Speaker 0: The rules are simple and there's a narrow space in which to make your decisions.

808
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:52,650
Speaker 0: But there's a surprising amount of play within that space, right?

809
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,223
Speaker 0: That's the best way I can describe the first few times I played this.

810
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,970
Speaker 1: I thought the game was problematic and that it was a snowball game.

811
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:06,130
Speaker 1: If you got pieces early that had a lot of buttons on them, then you would get a big income early, right?

812
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:14,050
Speaker 1: Like if you think about it, if you got a piece in your quilt with one button on it right at the beginning of the game, you actually just netted one button per income phase.

813
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,050
Speaker 0: And buttons are not only the currency of the game, but they're points at the end.

814
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,807
Speaker 1: So there's a set number of income times.

815
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,450
Speaker 1: You're only going to get income X number of times.

816
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,209
Speaker 1: I forget how many.

817
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,909
Speaker 1: It's like seven or eight times or something like that.

818
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,030
Speaker 1: So if you got one button right at the beginning of the game, right?

819
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,522
Speaker 1: That's huge.

820
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:32,990
Speaker 1: If you get two buttons right at the beginning of the game, that's really huge.

821
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,628
Speaker 1: Like you're getting two times eight, that's 16 buttons that you're getting.

822
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:44,590
Speaker 1: If you cross that first income phase without any buttons in your quilt, think about how much that comes out to at the end, right?

823
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:45,510
Speaker 1: It's all right.

824
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:57,369
Speaker 1: So I thought that the way to win this game was to get a bunch of buttons in your quilt early at any cost to get huge income, to buy amazing pieces, to have tons of buttons and just fill your quilt in as best you can.

825
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,430
Speaker 1: And then at the end of the game, we're going to win with a big fistful of buttons.

826
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:04,230
Speaker 1: And that is true to some extent, right?

827
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:10,409
Speaker 1: If you do get a bunch of buttons early, you will have a big income and it will snowball and you'll have a good score.

828
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:16,189
Speaker 1: Generally, that is, however, I was afraid it was, but it wasn't.

829
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,169
Speaker 1: You cannot like guarantee and lock in a win that way.

830
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:23,170
Speaker 1: It's not somebody else can have a lower income.

831
00:46:23,595 --> 00:46:24,609
Speaker 1: It's only a two player game.

832
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:29,010
Speaker 1: They can have a lower income and play more efficiently and fill in their quilt better.

833
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:34,230
Speaker 1: And as long as they have some kind of good enough income, they can beat you out.

834
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:42,610
Speaker 0: If you can't fill in your whole quilt because you moved so fast and sort of like how in someone else might be getting a bunch of pieces and setting up their stuff really well.

835
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,869
Speaker 0: But you've been accumulating the right numbers in this giant hand.

836
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,570
Speaker 0: And then you have a turn where you're like, I want that tile, that tile and that tile.

837
00:46:49,713 --> 00:46:49,906
Speaker 1: Yep.

838
00:46:50,495 --> 00:46:50,969
Speaker 1: It happens.

839
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:58,290
Speaker 1: It also be situations where it's like, OK, you spent ten buttons and bought a piece of three buttons on it and it filled in a whole bunch of your quilt really nicely.

840
00:46:58,352 --> 00:46:58,789
Speaker 1: That's great.

841
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:04,850
Speaker 1: I bought a piece that cost one button and that means I'm still got nine buttons left.

842
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,290
Speaker 1: That's like that's nine buttons.

843
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,889
Speaker 1: I didn't spend that you spent.

844
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:08,446
Speaker 1: Right.

845
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:13,709
Speaker 1: So even though my income is less, I actually got more buttons than you because I'm just holding on to them.

846
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:19,350
Speaker 1: I have a moderate income and I'm buying bargain basement pieces that are really effective.

847
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,450
Speaker 1: Whereas you are Uncle Moneybags over there with your big sack of buttons.

848
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,370
Speaker 1: You spent them all on the Mercedes piece and the, you know, the Ferrari piece.

849
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:28,749
Speaker 1: And now you broke son.

850
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,249
Speaker 0: Guess who wins now with these two currencies?

851
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:33,149
Speaker 0: Think of it this way.

852
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:41,890
Speaker 0: You've got one currency that is victory points and you you get them as income and you spend them to buy pieces that may or may not provide more income.

853
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:42,203
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:48,849
Speaker 0: The other currency is a fixed one where there's only a certain number of spaces you can move in the entire game.

855
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:54,190
Speaker 0: So there's one currency where you can only go down and it's worth bupkis at the end.

856
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,409
Speaker 0: You're always going to hit zero.

857
00:47:55,691 --> 00:48:01,329
Speaker 1: But at the very end of the game and the very last piece you take, it doesn't matter how many you take.

858
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:05,266
Speaker 1: So if you've got like one hourglass left, you're going to cross.

859
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:07,449
Speaker 1: you're at the next to last space on the board.

860
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:13,690
Speaker 1: As soon as you take a patch and add it to your quilt, it will be game over for you because you will cross the finish line.

861
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:20,788
Speaker 1: You can take a piece that has like theoretically like a thousand hourglasses on it because they let you do that.

862
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:26,408
Speaker 1: So you actually it's a variable number in that you don't have to cross the finish line exactly.

863
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:34,829
Speaker 1: You can benefit quite a lot by squeaking your way up to the finish line and then taking a piece that has like eight hourglasses on it.

864
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,310
Speaker 0: Now, so I mean, in the end, I mean, I'm probably going to buy the game, but I've been collecting.

865
00:48:39,471 --> 00:48:44,130
Speaker 0: I put it in the same class as Lost Cities and the morals game, the mushroom game.

866
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:44,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

867
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,429
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of games that are like little two battle lines.

868
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:49,848
Speaker 1: They come in the flat square box.

869
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,350
Speaker 0: That aligns with Kinesia, right?

870
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:51,705
Speaker 0: Yeah.

871
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:52,110
Speaker 0: Yeah.

872
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,970
Speaker 1: And it's one of those ones and it's a good one of those ones.

873
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:59,350
Speaker 1: It keeps getting checked out of, you know, the PAX library constantly.

874
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:00,429
Speaker 0: And it's pretty short.

875
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,490
Speaker 0: It's quick.

876
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,949
Speaker 0: It's really quick to learn.

877
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:03,322
Speaker 1: Yep.

878
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:11,470
Speaker 0: There's a lot of play in terms of skill and like you can just sort of play it like you're not going to play it out unless you really start memorizing build patterns.

879
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:17,949
Speaker 1: You start memory like you could really overanalyze it for like weeks on my phone and I'm still playing it occasionally.

880
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:18,930
Speaker 0: It's a good pooping game, I think.

881
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:19,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, good pooping game.

882
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:29,490
Speaker 1: I think the best thing about this game is that, you know, even compared to something like Lost Cities, it is way more accessible even to not board game people.

883
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:34,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would take me five minutes to explain this game to someone who's never played a board game before.

884
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,850
Speaker 1: You can get anyone to play this game and the theme is even accessible.

885
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,489
Speaker 0: Lost Cities requires me to explain a whole bunch of math repeatedly and people still don't get it.

886
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:48,470
Speaker 1: Right, but the quilt building part, you know, the theme of quilt building is totally chill with everyone, right?

887
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:50,270
Speaker 1: No one's opposed to quilt making.

888
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,549
Speaker 0: No one's offended by quilts.

889
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:58,910
Speaker 1: And then it's totally Tetris piece putting together, which is literally the most popular game that you want to play.

890
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,030
Speaker 1: So if you just say, hey, you know, it's like block us, right?

891
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,790
Speaker 1: You can just get anyone to play this.

892
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:11,550
Speaker 1: And the fact that it's fast and also two player, you know, you don't need to get this whole group of nerds together to make it happen.

893
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:14,588
Speaker 1: You can just open it up with one person and teach them to play and go.

894
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:18,030
Speaker 1: I think it's like a super good entry way.

895
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,729
Speaker 1: If you need to get one person into board gaming as a hobby.

896
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,330
Speaker 1: This is like maybe the best game you can get.

897
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,950
Speaker 0: And in general, these games.

898
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,830
Speaker 1: I can't think of another two player one that's as good at that.

899
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,513
Speaker 1: You need

900
00:50:29,553 --> 00:50:45,147
Speaker 0: to bring a few of them anytime you go to a gaming kind of like a PAX, because you're always going to be in a situation where three of your friends are in the middle of a tabletop game and there's and then you're sitting there just waiting for them to finish and another person walks up and you need to keep them in your orbit until the next five player game.

901
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,628
Speaker 1: Get the app on the iPad.

902
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:48,990
Speaker 1: It's even because then the setup is way faster.

903
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,133
Speaker 1: Yeah.

904
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:55,006
Speaker 0: I think I would prefer to play with physical pieces because then they're all out all the time.

905
00:50:56,193 --> 00:51:00,170
Speaker 1: So the app's credit, it lets you scroll around and see all the pieces.

906
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,430
Speaker 0: And when you're zoomed in, it shows you a representation of everything that's left.

907
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,710
Speaker 1: It's like it really lets you look at all the information and it's like.

908
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,369
Speaker 0: The app does as good a job as it can do.

909
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,642
Speaker 0: And it's like 90% there.

910
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:14,230
Speaker 1: It's like one of the best board game apps I've had ever.

911
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,630
Speaker 0: That's why I'm not complaining about this.

912
00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:16,119
Speaker 1: iPad helps.

913
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,790
Speaker 1: But listen, I play on my phone, no problem.

914
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,569
Speaker 0: But I would prefer it physically just because of the way I play games with extent information like the pieces.

915
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:32,510
Speaker 1: If I could see being able to see everything at once and not having to scroll to like remember what I just looked at, it would be very helpful.

916
00:51:32,932 --> 00:51:35,190
Speaker 1: But I mean, you're not going to make that happen.

917
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:36,179
Speaker 1: That's it.

918
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,189
Speaker 0: It's a trade off.

919
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,810
Speaker 0: You can get that holistic extent information experience by playing it physically.

920
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:48,589
Speaker 0: But then you have to do all the stuff that the game just sort of handles, like counting out the income will slow the game down.

921
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:51,330
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, what's my income?

922
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:53,229
Speaker 1: That could suck.

923
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,610
Speaker 0: But it's a good game.

924
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,329
Speaker 0: I'm probably going to buy it.

925
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:58,170
Speaker 0: I'll add it to my bag of tiny games.

926
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,480
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

936
00:53:27,602 --> 00:53:29,178
Speaker 0: You guys are just making this hard for me.

937
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:32,879
Speaker 0: The anxiety I have trying to say these names and not fuck them up.

938
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:43,460
Speaker 0: I am real glad that I did not commit to saying all the rest of these names of all the people who are either only given a dollar or actually there's some people who give a lot of money, but just don't want me to say their name.

939
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,479
Speaker 0: That's that's cool, I guess.

940
00:53:46,883 --> 00:53:49,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope you voted and now I leave you with something great.

941
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:23,927
Speaker 0: I'm laughing for real right now.
