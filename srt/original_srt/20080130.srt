10
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,800
Speaker 1: I think I'm like the 18th of January like I fixed a bug, but I didn't actually fix it.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,009
Speaker 1: I made a typo and I caused something to break.

12
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,205
Speaker 1: and then you know of course we find out about this right We don't discover it until today.

13
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:58,440
Speaker 1: first of all right, and we don't discover it until five minutes before I'm gonna leave.

14
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:04,819
Speaker 1: So you know normally I'm like up screw you times up and going home right, but you know I broke it.

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,880
Speaker 1: I got to fix it, and it was you know there's the thing processes at the end of the month.

16
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,339
Speaker 1: So of course the end of the month is tomorrow.

17
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:16,323
Speaker 1: So So I said okay, I screwed up I'll fix it.

18
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:20,320
Speaker 1: so I stayed there and fixed it which meant you know I stayed at work an extra 30 minutes to fix it.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,346
Speaker 1: Cuz you know I knew how to fix it.

20
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:23,440
Speaker 1: I and we had problems with this in the past.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,040
Speaker 1: I had scripts to repair it and such you know, but I had to do some things.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,899
Speaker 1: You know it took a half hour which of course means I get home like an hour later than I usually do so.

23
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,109
Speaker 0: See that's a different brand of a cowboy hat.

24
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,911
Speaker 0: usually when I have put on my cowboy hat it is Just type something.

25
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:42,004
Speaker 0: it's like oh, I see your problem I know how to fix it.

26
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:49,273
Speaker 0: and I type something in some Unix server Linux server And I hit enter and it's not until after I hit enter that my brain says alright.

27
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,039
Speaker 1: You just typed RMRF slash.

28
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,982
Speaker 0: good job It's more like.

00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:54,204
Speaker 0: my brain says alright.

30
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,710
Speaker 0: You just type that and now it's too late to undo it.

31
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,156
Speaker 0: What did that do and what server were you SSH into?

32
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:10,925
Speaker 1: You know if it caused a problem you'll find out soon enough, and if it didn't cause a problem well Then everything's Jim Dandy.

33
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:14,079
Speaker 0: yes, everything's Jim Dandy fine until I get arrested.

34
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:26,575
Speaker 0: oh Yeah, oh well anyway We had there's obvious news to talk about in the anime world, but for obvious reasons We're gonna kind of hold off on that until the main bid.

35
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:31,853
Speaker 0: so the Scott What do you have in the anime news world since since night?

36
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:35,405
Speaker 0: that does not relate to perhaps the Elephant sitting in the room.

37
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:39,740
Speaker 1: well my news is gonna be that elephant, so you sort of stole my thunder.

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,740
Speaker 1: I don't know what I'm gonna do for a news which means back to my policy.

00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,460
Speaker 1: It can't be bad, right?

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,654
Speaker 0: Well is that still true?

50
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:07,280
Speaker 1: well?

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,631
Speaker 1: Let me let me give you a little a little backstory about this goo and saga.

52
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,742
Speaker 1: real quick right the goo and saga is fucking Famous.

53
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:21,672
Speaker 1: like I didn't know shit about it, but if you would have said goo and saga to me I would have said I heard of that, but I don't know anything about it now.

54
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:23,980
Speaker 1: I know a little bit more about it, right?

55
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:35,661
Speaker 1: Apparently it is a series of fantasy novels by a guy named karu kurimoto, right It's been in continuous publication since 1979.

56
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:39,713
Speaker 1: He planned when he started to make a hundred volumes so far.

57
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,780
Speaker 1: He's made a hundred and eighteen volumes.

58
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:46,175
Speaker 1: It's it's like think like Lord of the Rings of Japan.

59
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:57,140
Speaker 1: That's the kind of fantasy We're talking here right and the basic story is there's a dude He's got a leopard head and like a human humanoid body, and he's a badass.

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,949
Speaker 1: fantasy occurs You know if you like berserk.

61
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:09,640
Speaker 0: if you I was about to ask is it like yes Keflon a style of fantasy the lotus war style of fantasy or the bastard?

62
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:10,784
Speaker 1: It's.

63
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:11,854
Speaker 1: it's somewhere between.

64
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:12,661
Speaker 1: you know berserk It's.

65
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,550
Speaker 1: it's the storyline.

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,599
Speaker 1: stylings are sort of more like berserk But the thematic things are more Lord of the Rings ish.

67
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,910
Speaker 1: You know in fact the berserk creator according to Wikipedia said that Gooben saga was a large influence on him.

68
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:33,977
Speaker 1: right so as a hundred and eight a series of 118 novels and so for vertical is actually publishing the novels in English as well so far.

69
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:34,940
Speaker 1: They've put out four.

70
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:41,440
Speaker 1: He got a hundred and fourteen to go Maybe and of course in Japan the guy's always writing more.

71
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,424
Speaker 1: You know cuz he's a machine.

72
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:47,471
Speaker 0: you know this is one of those times where the typical policy of I'll just wait for a box Probably.

73
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm gonna try to read the novels.

74
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,760
Speaker 1: We'll see if they're any good because this manga all right.

75
00:04:54,041 --> 00:05:01,071
Speaker 1: I read this manga not knowing anything about the goon saga except leopard head guy right and The thing is this is a pretty good.

76
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:02,500
Speaker 1: You know fantasy story.

77
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,305
Speaker 1: There's some weird stuff going on.

78
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:13,240
Speaker 1: the leopard guy comes in and it see you know it seems like you don't know enough About really the backstory which I found out later.

79
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:17,864
Speaker 1: Oh cuz this totally starts somewhere in the middle of the goon saga even though It's volume one of the manga.

80
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:22,580
Speaker 1: the manga here is not actually just a manga version of the novels.

81
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:27,360
Speaker 1: It's actually like a goon saga story by the guy who writes the goon saga.

82
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:28,905
Speaker 1: It's just in manga form.

83
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:36,893
Speaker 1: so it's like if you don't if you're not already familiar with the goon saga a lot of things I guess they it's assumed you would know while reading this.

84
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:37,535
Speaker 1: you don't know.

85
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:51,650
Speaker 1: so Yeah, I basically read it not knowing information that the book assumed I would know and I think there were some things missing because of that, but despite not knowing things It was pretty fucking entertaining.

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,800
Speaker 1: I mean you got you got giant spiders.

87
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:57,113
Speaker 1: You got you got guys chopping people's heads off.

88
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:58,900
Speaker 0: you got got a leopard head.

89
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:06,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got this like sage and his head falls off, and then he puts his head back on The leopard head.

90
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:12,716
Speaker 1: the the leopard-headed guy is the main character and he's sort of like a Horatio kind of.

91
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:16,070
Speaker 1: Wait a minute wait a minute now a little flog a kind of guy.

92
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,760
Speaker 0: where he is he movie Horatio or books Horatio.

93
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:19,363
Speaker 1: He's.

94
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:20,831
Speaker 1: he's kind of like.

95
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:31,134
Speaker 1: he's always smart He knows what's going on, and he's super badass all at the same time, but still there'll be times where he's like Kind of like.

96
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,419
Speaker 0: oh I wasn't quite sure what.

97
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:39,920
Speaker 1: Well you know it'll be like something like one frame.

98
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:41,951
Speaker 1: He'll be like well I'm gonna kick ass.

99
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:42,818
Speaker 1: the next frame he'd be like.

100
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:44,224
Speaker 0: To me.

101
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:51,218
Speaker 0: that that sound effect is what I heard in my head when Sean Connery playing in that manga samurai crusader.

102
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,534
Speaker 1: yeah, because he's sort of like that kind of in a way.

103
00:06:54,594 --> 00:07:03,660
Speaker 1: and You know even though I didn't you know I went into this sort of not with the Appropriate background in the goon saga.

104
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:08,720
Speaker 1: It was still good, and it shows that vertical is really smart, and they only publish the high-quality stuff.

105
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:17,320
Speaker 1: But I would still probably recommend that You go and get some knowledge and experience with the goon saga before trying to read this manga.

106
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:24,106
Speaker 1: That way you will get the maximum effect because I definitely felt like if I knew it was going on it would have been way More awesome than it was.

107
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:24,969
Speaker 0: you got a level up.

108
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,119
Speaker 0: you got to read some other things kind of build up to.

109
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,298
Speaker 1: yeah I'm gonna go and get some of the the novels that vertical published and maybe read one or two.

110
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:38,560
Speaker 1: of course I'll read those way later like after I read some other things that I was supposed to be reading like other fantasy novels.

111
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,978
Speaker 0: Maybe what about that?

112
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,972
Speaker 0: Anime that you said you were gonna watch.

113
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:44,100
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do that.

114
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,040
Speaker 0: We were thinking about reviewing this week instead of kind of copping out and talking about current events this week.

115
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,523
Speaker 1: I'm doing it.

116
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:51,589
Speaker 0: Oh, are you?

117
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,419

Speaker 0: So you're gonna finish it next week.

121
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,982
Speaker 1: I'll finish it soon enough Right.

122
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:08,159
Speaker 0: so the only other news of interest other than the news is that?

123
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,781
Speaker 0: Otakon.

124
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:14,315
Speaker 0: well Otakon is run by Otakarp and Otakarp had a president.

125
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:21,439
Speaker 0: the president was Sam Dang Who is known as generally being one of those kind of epic con staff at Otakon dudes mm-hmm?

126
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 0: Well he has stepped down for undisclosed personal reasons that apparently are not related to the con.

127
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:33,879
Speaker 1: Yeah It doesn't sound like it sounds like this is legitimately someone's personal issues with their private life and not some sort of you know.

128
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:38,657
Speaker 1: Oh, he says personal reasons, but really there was a drama with the con.

129
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:39,058
Speaker 1: not it.

130
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,893
Speaker 1: really I don't think there was any con drama.

131
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:42,201
Speaker 0: yeah now luckily I didn't.

132
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:49,299
Speaker 0: I expected after this announcement to see you know the usual shit store of internet people not understanding what they're talking about But people were kind of quiet about it.

133
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:57,022
Speaker 0: But just to make sure all indications are that this will have no effect whatsoever on Otakon happening and/or being awesome Mm-hmm.

Speaker 0: in fact a little bird who may or may not be a doctor who fan has Mentioned to me briefly.

155
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,086
Speaker 1: I really think so.

156
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:20,360
Speaker 1: you know I feel like and I even if that's not true I think it's because penny arcade makes you believe it that it becomes true.

157
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:21,646
Speaker 0: I have a feeling.

158
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 0: maybe I should just take off the two weeks between these two cons.

159
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:25,945
Speaker 1: I wish I could.

160
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:29,100
Speaker 1: I did get you know final permission day to take some unpaid days.

161
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,398
Speaker 0: I actually discover that I have like five more vacation days than I thought I had.

162
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:41,937
Speaker 1: yeah well I'm gonna get some unpaid days, so I think we're gonna do the trip We're gonna do all the three cons that we need days off for and I think I'm gonna go to Florida to to see my Grandma who haven't seen in like year

163
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,837
Speaker 0: Because I'm thinking about just taking a few days off to chill like after Otakon or something.

164
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:50,130
Speaker 1: well You could do whatever you want, but it's actually really convenient.

165
00:10:50,151 --> 00:11:02,159
Speaker 1: like the the Monday after Katsu khan is President's Day Which we now get off, but we didn't get it off last year and the Monday after PAX I think is Labor Day, so we get that off because it's fucking Labor Day not bad Yeah, so saving days.

166
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:15,420
Speaker 0: But yeah If if Otakon is epic and all indications are that Otakon is gonna do something epic this year And and I point out this is just observation that the last epic thing Otakon did was get freaking lark.

167
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:18,934
Speaker 0: Let's come and do a full-on concert in the arena.

168
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,220
Speaker 1: I'm telling you it's gonna be.

169
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:22,335
Speaker 1: It's gonna be too mix.

170
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:22,639
Speaker 1: It's good.

171
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:31,755
Speaker 1: it's gonna be a Yumi Hamasaki and And Utada Hikaru duets with the Yoko Kanno on piano.

172
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:32,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

173
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:37,919
Speaker 1: And they're gonna raise Tezuka from the dead and Miyazaki's coming.

174
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:40,959
Speaker 0: Satoshi khan is going to Satoshi khan.

175
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:45,388
Speaker 1: Satoshi khan Miyazaki and Tezuka risen from the zombie.

176
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:55,180
Speaker 1: Tezuka are all gonna get up work together and create an anime live for us While at Otakon and we can watch it there, and that will be the only time it's shown.

177
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:58,360
Speaker 1: And then it'll be destroyed and zombie Tezuka will go back to his grave.

178
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:04,825
Speaker 1: it'll be animated in real time and oh, yeah, and since you know, Yoko Kanno and Yumi will be there.

179
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:05,729
Speaker 1: They're gonna make all the music.

180
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:20,300
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and once again Right, but yes, I think that that is pretty much the oh, you know It's awesome as awesome as Otakon is and as much as I'm sure they are gonna completely blow us away.

181
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:31,060
Speaker 1: You know just looking at the history of things Pax has done and how it has consistently topped itself I really think that they are gonna need zombie Tezuka to beat Pax Or 2Mix.

182
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:40,640
Speaker 0: I just don't not me so much anymore either But I got to admit in the 90s 2Mix was as far as I could tell the best band ever.

183
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:43,611
Speaker 1: You were way into the 2Mix before like.

184
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:47,206
Speaker 1: I didn't even find out about it till I got to RIT and I didn't you Know every song is the same.

185
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:48,897
Speaker 0: So yeah, I didn't realize that right away.

186
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:53,610
Speaker 0: Yeah But I remember like every year for a long time.

187
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,760
Speaker 0: There was always the rumor that yeah, I heard Otakon's got 2Mix.

188
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:58,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard Otakon's got.

189
00:12:58,346 --> 00:12:59,490
Speaker 0: Otakon never had 2Mix.

190
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,035
Speaker 0: What were you people thinking?

191
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,239
Speaker 1: That Yoko Kanno once.

192
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:07,134
Speaker 0: But yeah, Otakon's gonna be epic.

193
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,120
Speaker 0: Pax is gonna be epic.

194
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,201
Speaker 0: We're gonna be at both.

195
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:20,710
Speaker 0: and don't forget KatsuKan August 2008 epic things of the day.

196
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:31,029
Speaker 0: now I really like aside from 2Mix Japanese like historical kind of music like with the traditional old instruments, you know the drum that goes pong pong pong the guy that goes.

00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:38,222
Speaker 0: You know the nice little guitar with the little.

200
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:44,586
Speaker 1: uh, it's not a guitar But it has that sort of weird shaped white plucking thing like a gigantic fan pick.

201
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:48,190
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway I wish I knew what they were called so I wouldn't sound like a moron.

207
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,890
Speaker 0: I thought it was Scott, but I guess it wasn't because he hadn't seen it until I showed it to him.

208
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,100
Speaker 0: So whoever sent this to me Tell me who it was because I forgot and you're kind of cool for finding this.

00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:39,736
Speaker 0: the website is in Pockner ease, but it is Smoke on the water as done by a band playing these traditional Japanese instruments and it looks like this was a kind of big deal, you know classical concert and They just kind of randomly in the middle of the set just played smoke on the water instead of whatever they were gonna be playing because the audience says the reaction you would expect of Rabble rabble rabble.

228
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:29,490
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, the newest or like the most recently discovered by me of those things is here.

Speaker 1: Are you ready?

230
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:31,121

Speaker 1: may.

233
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:58,321
Speaker 1: what we have here are basically incredibly fancy headphone sets from around the world such as the Sennheiser HD 4140 the Bose tri-port the technics RF 30 even the Eddie modics that are way more expensive than ours the Let's see the grotto RS 1, you

234
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,405
Speaker 0: know, I'll say one thing.

235
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:00,390
Speaker 0: just be related to that.

236
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:05,244
Speaker 0: I don't care how much you are into audio how much you think it matters you.

237
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:08,937
Speaker 0: there is no reason to ever spend more than About two hundred dollars on headphones.

238
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:09,579
Speaker 0: That's true.

239
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,346
Speaker 1: But the costs?

240
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:12,190
Speaker 1: porta pro.

241
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:21,445
Speaker 1: But yeah They've got a picture here of a girl for every set of headphones and all the girls are wearing the associated headphones So they're not like hanging on some guy's head.

242
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,518
Speaker 1: Yeah Look over here.

243
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:24,769
Speaker 1: Look at this, huh?

244
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:27,110
Speaker 0: You know, it's kind of a logical extension.

245
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,886
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that eventually there will be a ton for every possible device.

246
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:32,287
Speaker 0: that I don't.

247
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:36,142
Speaker 1: this isn't a time This is a Musa may get it right the same thing.

248
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:36,966
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

249
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:37,930
Speaker 1: I don't know what the difference is.

250
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,857
Speaker 0: I'll say one thing they're all girls aren't they?

251
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:40,781
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

252
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:41,443
Speaker 0: Oh, huh?

00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,110
Speaker 0: Yeah see that they're all girls.

254
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:45,077
Speaker 1: They're not really that perverted.

255
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:46,502
Speaker 0: None of them are now all.

256
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,088
Speaker 1: some of them are a little bit but which ones?

257
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:48,750
Speaker 0: what have you been?

258
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,094
Speaker 1: Looking at now some of these are Like this one.

259
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:54,827
Speaker 1: that's where like the AKG k271 is a little.

260
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:58,806
Speaker 0: well Well, that's understandable because those are some really really perverted headphones.

261
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:03,946
Speaker 1: Let me tell ya The AKG k1 seems like the AKG ones are more perverted some of the others.

262
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:05,010
Speaker 1: What's up with that?

263
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Yeah, this just shows you how far those crazy Japanese people go.

264
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,270
Speaker 1: plus you look at the quality of the art on this.

265
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,598
Speaker 1: you know, it's not like the best art in the universe, but Someone with art skills made this.

266
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,079
Speaker 1: I think I'd like to get them to the fucking design chip for us Instead of making useless headphone moose.

267
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:26,045
Speaker 0: amaze, they're not useless.

268
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,414
Speaker 1: Oh Hey, what's the use then?

269
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,383
Speaker 0: I wasn't gonna back that statement up.

270
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:31,870
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

271
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get some of challenges you step down, right?

272
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:37,301
Speaker 0: So, uh The news the big news.

273
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,030
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into the details of it.

274
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,130
Speaker 0: I'm sure if you care you read anime news network, and that's pretty much as much as you're gonna get about this.

275
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:47,210
Speaker 0: But a TV is in some trouble.

276
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:55,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can't exactly figure out what the real like exactly the full story of who what where when why how.

277
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,114
Speaker 0: but We know who.

278
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:59,895
Speaker 1: well, okay but the what where when why how.

279
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:05,409
Speaker 1: but they have removed various titles that they previously licensed from their website.

280
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,670
Speaker 1: and You know, I've I've been to the ATV website many times in the past, right?

281
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:17,899
Speaker 1: And we're talking about a website here where these people had like three volumes of yotsuba on the shelves and not one mention of Yotsuba on their website.

282
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,910
Speaker 1: right is a shittily Poorly updated website and not frequently updated.

283
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:39,410
Speaker 1: so the fact that they're removing titles from their site show that there was a problem and people looked into it and Apparently yes, they've through some sort of business of dealings Who knows the exact detail say because the anime industry is a secret cabal in this country.

284
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:46,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't really understand exactly what happened had to do with some kind of Financer something company.

285
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:47,140
Speaker 1: I don't know.

286
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:54,075
Speaker 1: I don't understand it, but they lost or temporarily lost the Licenses to some things they licensed.

287
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:54,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, now the

288
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:59,246
Speaker 1: only one I care about which is project blue earth SOS and the other ones I don't give a shit

289
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:13,689
Speaker 0: Don't know because there was like a letter that was leaked that was sent to retailers but then someone came forward and said that that wasn't true and it just I'm not gonna say the obvious that maybe if you weren't always so secretive about all this

290
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,400
Speaker 1: People wouldn't be spreading bullshit rumors.

291
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,930
Speaker 1: if he just came out and said what the deal was.

292
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:26,410
Speaker 1: I think the other problem maybe your fans would feel closer to you and give you more money if you were more friendly with them Instead of distant and secretive.

293
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:34,289
Speaker 0: I think the other problem is that they are kind of keeping silent and as a result All it really does is lend veracity to all these rumors.

294
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much

295
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:51,088
Speaker 0: but the official statement that they as as of recording of geek nights that they have put forth is that quote We know There are a lot of rumors swirling about and the fans are looking for assurances that ADV will continue to distribute the anime series They know and love.

296
00:19:51,854 --> 00:20:00,865
Speaker 0: While we can't go into any detail at this time Please know that ADV is working through a few short-term challenges and fully intends.

297
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,017
Speaker 0: I know the word intend To continue our releases.

298
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,563
Speaker 0: we thank you for your patience.

299
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:08,610
Speaker 0: And as far as I can see that is all they have said.

300
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:13,914
Speaker 1: We're having technical difficulties, please stand by Now.

301
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,690
Speaker 0: that is not really doesn't instill a lot of confidence.

302
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:24,860
Speaker 0: It's not really what I want to talk about because what I've seen the internet saying about this is largely It's all the fans subs fault.

303
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,930
Speaker 0: you damn pirates ruined it for all of us.

304
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,890
Speaker 0: We told you this would happen and now it's happening.

305
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,740
Speaker 0: You got to buy anime to support anime.

306
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,590
Speaker 0: if you don't buy anime anime is gonna go away.

307
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,990
Speaker 0: And I'm talking until I run out of air in my lungs.

308
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:38,317
Speaker 1: Here's the thing I find really interesting.

309
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,004
Speaker 1: right is that genie on went under?

310
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:50,067
Speaker 1: right but other than that You know other than genie on going under We really you know, there's no information about sales figures for anime DVDs or anything like that, right?

311
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:50,930
Speaker 1: That's we always complain.

312
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,956
Speaker 1: There's no sales figures.

313
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:58,990
Speaker 1: yet for the past many weeks People have been starting to discuss and rumble about anime DVD sales going down the shitter.

314
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,383
Speaker 1: How did you know they were going down the shitter?

315
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:02,510
Speaker 1: How did anyone know?

316
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:11,583
Speaker 0: I think the only thing I have to go on is word of mouth and I know that I don't buy anime and I know That most of the people I know I buy anime just rarely.

317
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:12,326
Speaker 0: Well, that's that.

318
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:14,113
Speaker 0: but as a result What art?

319
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:14,233
Speaker 0: look?

Speaker 1: You didn't buy it for you.

331
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:38,078
Speaker 1: Someone else bought it.

332
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:38,701
Speaker 1: It's not yours.

333
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:39,505

00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:40,750

Speaker 1: Oh, you sold them to him.

336
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,577
Speaker 0: I thought he bought them in the first people like the second half of the series But I bought the first half.

337
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,690
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, cuz no one wanted to like that.

338
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,681
Speaker 0: No one liked that show until I showed it to him.

339
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:51,973
Speaker 0: They're like that is big a big noses I don't get it.

340
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,509
Speaker 0: And then I was like, well, you're gonna watch and you're gonna like it.

341
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:54,609
Speaker 0: then.

342
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,759
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess they liked it.

343
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,241
Speaker 0: I Can't think of a new show.

344
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:03,887
Speaker 1: I've bought New show new show about master Keaton on a discount rack.

345
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:07,217
Speaker 1: Oh Boy bebop that new cheat box set.

346
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:10,846
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz cowboy bebop just came out like what about project blue cheek usos.

347
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:14,423
Speaker 1: Oh But wait, that's they just lost the license for that.

348
00:22:14,444 --> 00:22:17,465
Speaker 0: Who knows what's gonna happen Now what we want to talk about tonight?

349
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:29,270
Speaker 0: and well, we'll see how far we go with this because this could be broken up in any number of topics, but It's either why I don't buy anime DVDs or more importantly why no one's buying anime DVDs now.

350
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:34,570
Speaker 0: If this is wrong if this is a lie, and in fact anime DVD sales are just fine.

351
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:46,048
Speaker 0: Well, I just asked for anyone in the industry to tell us we're wrong and I'll gladly say oh, yes it turns out that animated sales are fine, but Every indication I have is that your DVDs aren't selling.

352
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:49,850
Speaker 1: well I think this episode is really gonna be gonna be two things, right?

353
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,141
Speaker 1: It's gonna be well and one is the result of the other.

354
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:55,616
Speaker 1: this episode is just gonna be us Speculating and you know what?

355
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:58,310
Speaker 1: I found speculation speculation You know what?

356
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:10,970
Speaker 1: I found out a lot of really entertaining shows on TV and radio are just people sitting around Speculating, you know, especially things like sports shows and and stuff like that, you know where there's no actual news.

357
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,621
Speaker 1: You know people deliver the news.

358
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:13,568
Speaker 1: then what do they do?

359
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:20,188
Speaker 1: Well, well all they can do besides after they comment on the news is speculate and apparently the speculating is mad entertaining.

360
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,952
Speaker 1: So get ready Speculation.

361
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:35,477
Speaker 0: Well, I'm pretty sure that the anime industry is gonna be okay in the end because I can't believe bebop 2 is coming out tomorrow and So let's let's let's start talking about why we don't.

362
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,559
Speaker 1: we already did a show on.

363
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:44,245
Speaker 1: You know, this is not a charity whatever so I don't want to retread that ground but in the forum recently There was a discussion about this.

364
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:56,559
Speaker 0: No region 1 anime DVD sales are in the crapper we think and The argument basically came down to half the people saying it's you damn dirty fansubber Pirates not watching the show on the fansub and not buying it.

365
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:02,080
Speaker 0: That's why there's no money in anime anymore and the other half of people saying I don't care.

366
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:05,500
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing right with the fansub.

367
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,426
Speaker 1: so let's let's get the fan.

368
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,025
Speaker 1: we could do a whole show on the stupid fansub just to get her out of the Way, right?

369
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:13,280
Speaker 1: I Think personally right everything that I've ever seen right?

370
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,895
Speaker 1: I watch the fansubs right and I also buy the anime but rarely and you know what.

371
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:20,560
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be perfectly honest.

372
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,687
Speaker 1: I am not lying if you choose not to believe me.

373
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:23,369
Speaker 1: Oh, well, right?

374
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:26,560
Speaker 1: I don't have some sort of addiction to anime.

375
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:35,383
Speaker 1: It's not like crack or heroin where I need anime, right if the show wasn't on fansub I just wouldn't hear about it and wouldn't watch it Like what?

376
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:36,407
Speaker 1: what's one of the new shows?

377
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:39,240
Speaker 1: we just watch spice and wolf spice and wolf, right?

378
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,710
Speaker 1: Spice and wolf is an okay show.

379
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:42,240
Speaker 1: It was a free fansub.

380
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,255
Speaker 1: It was incredibly easy to get and incredibly convenient to watch.

381
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:46,180
Speaker 1: it cost me nothing.

382
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:54,960
Speaker 1: So I watched an episode or two, right if that show let's say fansubs didn't exist and spice and wolf was only on DVD And let's even give them the benefit of the doubt.

383
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,912
Speaker 1: I heard about the show and I found out that I would like it.

384
00:24:58,073 --> 00:24:59,599
Speaker 1: right I probably wouldn't buy it.

385
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:00,643
Speaker 0: You know what I do?

386
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:02,249
Speaker 0: I Netflix it at best.

387
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:05,440
Speaker 1: I'm only watching it because it's free.

388
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,580
Speaker 1: I mean, I only I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it so badly that I'm gonna pay money for it.

389
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,600
Speaker 1: I only want to watch it a very tiny bit.

390
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:22,620
Speaker 1: So because it's so easy for me to watch it My desire is very low, but the effort required to achieve that desire is also very low.

391
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,942
Speaker 1: Therefore I watch it.

392
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:36,117
Speaker 1: if the difficulty required to achieve the desire was higher such as I had to buy the DVD and My desire for it would not change, you know, so I then I just wouldn't watch it.

393
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:42,700
Speaker 1: and I think Anime is very popular because it's so easy to watch with the fansubs.

394
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,080
Speaker 1: They're all these people who are watching the fansubs.

395
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:49,296
Speaker 1: They're watching it because they have a slight desire to watch anime.

396
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:52,608
Speaker 1: not a huge desire Just a little bit of desire, but it's so easy.

397
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:56,320
Speaker 1: So they watch it and if it wasn't easy, they just wouldn't watch.

398
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,426
Speaker 1: They're not losing out on DVD.

399
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:01,735
Speaker 1: the people who want to buy the DVDs are buying them.

400
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:07,271
Speaker 1: the people who are the strong desire To watch these shows, you know, those people are buying DVDs.

401
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,174
Speaker 1: Do you I really?

402
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:11,185
Speaker 1: I've never met anyone who is like He he he.

403
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:13,535
Speaker 1: I want to watch anime really badly.

404
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:14,540
Speaker 1: I need it like crack.

405
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:18,140
Speaker 1: I'm willing to go through any you know steps in the whole world to watch it.

406
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,280
Speaker 1: I need it so badly that I would buy it on DVD, but I'm not gonna buy it on DVD.

407
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:24,015
Speaker 1: I get it squashed the fansubs to save a bunch of money.

408
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:30,180
Speaker 1: Hahaha I've never met anyone who's that has such a strong desire to watch pays for it.

409
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:34,540
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a lot of kids who are super into like Naruto or whatever.

410
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,637
Speaker 0: They they love that stuff and they they pirate it, but they don't have.

411
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:41,793
Speaker 0: they don't have money Yeah, but they could probably convince their parents.

412
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:42,920
Speaker 0: I don't know.

413
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:51,554
Speaker 0: See, I'm gonna go on a slightly different tack here because I mean it's one thing to say Yeah, well watch the fansub but I but I watch fansubs.

414
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:53,160
Speaker 0: I don't watch a whole show on fansub it.

415
00:26:53,381 --> 00:26:59,280
Speaker 0: I'll watch a couple episodes and when I haven't watched the whole show on fansubs since like since Fullmetal Alchemist.

416
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:02,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fullmetal Alchemist is the last show I watched entirely fansub.

417
00:27:02,677 --> 00:27:03,199
Speaker 1: then you know what?

418
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:16,235
Speaker 1: If the DVDs had come out I'm gonna be honest if Fullmetal Alchemist was a good example because if the DVDs were coming out While the show is still really wicked popular right like at that time.

419
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:27,495
Speaker 1: I probably would have bought them You know because the show was so popular right then and there right but the show You know after you finished watching it, there was no desire to ever watch it again.

420
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:28,799
Speaker 1: It was a one-time show.

421
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,345
Speaker 0: so That's the thing.

422
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:31,908
Speaker 0: That's the tack.

423
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:32,613
Speaker 0: I'm going out of here.

424
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:33,076
Speaker 0: is that one?

425
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:44,046
Speaker 0: All right I'll look at me about my the example of me as a person and why despite being a huge anime fan I never having lots of money and having plenty of money and Not pirating.

426
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:46,360
Speaker 0: I still don't buy any anime.

427
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:47,799
Speaker 0: Let's see first off.

428
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:51,319
Speaker 0: The only reason I would ever buy a DVD and it's not just an image for anything.

429
00:27:51,464 --> 00:28:05,151
Speaker 0: Yeah Me too is if either one it's something that I expect to watch multiple times over the course of my life - that I want to lend to and show to other people Mm-hmm if one or both of those are not true.

430
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:07,380
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy because there's no reason to now.

431
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:10,268
Speaker 0: Alright, let's look at the legal ways.

432
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:14,400
Speaker 0: I can watch my anime without buying it one Netflix.

433
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:29,797
Speaker 0: now You say yeah, they get some money if the Netflix buys the DVDs and that is true But you don't get nearly as much money if Netflix buys four copies of your DVD Even if they're expensive rental copies and then every anime fan watches those DVDs versus if they buy them for $23 each.

434
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there might be some.

435
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:37,593
Speaker 1: I don't know exactly the finances of that situation But I can definitely pretty much guarantee that.

436
00:28:37,874 --> 00:28:43,476
Speaker 1: uh-huh, you know you need One rental is not as much money as a purchase at Best Buy.

437
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:44,360
Speaker 1: There's no way.

438
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:48,258
Speaker 0: Now the thing is Netflix serves the purpose of one thing and that is alright.

439
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:49,282
Speaker 0: There's a show I want to watch.

440
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:51,130
Speaker 0: it already aired on Japan.

441
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,475
Speaker 0: It's done airing.

442
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:53,800
Speaker 0: I heard it was good.

443
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,448
Speaker 0: So now I want to watch it.

444
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,960
Speaker 0: Well, I'm going to put it in my neck Netflix queue.

445
00:28:58,563 --> 00:28:59,909
Speaker 0: I don't care when I see it.

446
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,179
Speaker 0: I'm gonna see it at some point and that's it.

447
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:08,919
Speaker 0: Now if I want to see something more Urgently or I want to see while it's coming out the option would be obviously to watch it on TV.

448
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,676
Speaker 0: now You might say yeah, but a lot of anime isn't on TV.

449
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:12,119
Speaker 0: I get to that.

450
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,720
Speaker 0: Let's say that all anime was on TV in the u.s.

451
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:20,475
Speaker 0: It was just on TV at like eight o'clock with ads and that's how they made all their money.

452
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,560
Speaker 1: or we lived in Japan.

453
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,720
Speaker 1: How about we live in Japan?

454
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I spoke Japanese.

455
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:27,260
Speaker 0: so I get a satellite and I pay and I can just watch anime.

456
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:28,142
Speaker 0: No That's ooh.

457
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:31,800
Speaker 0: now if anime were on teeth like spice and wolf is a good example or fma or anything?

458
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:36,280
Speaker 1: What about those animes that are on like over-the-air broadcast in like one part of Japan?

459
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,167
Speaker 0: Well, I'm screwed there.

460
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:40,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then alright those shows.

461
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:44,320
Speaker 1: I have a house in Osaka with an internet connection and it goes to my house in New York.

462
00:29:44,761 --> 00:29:51,459
Speaker 0: Now most shows like that like most media in general most television shows unless there's something crazy.

463
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,826
Speaker 0: Awesome I only want to watch it once.

464
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:54,153
Speaker 0: then I want to watch it as it comes out.

465
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:55,300
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna watch it on TV.

466
00:29:55,621 --> 00:30:00,697
Speaker 0: All right, I'll watch it on TV as it comes out, but I'm not an old man.

467
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:15,415
Speaker 0: I Have a TiVo So I tell my TiVo to record all the anime I want to see off of the TV whenever it comes on and then whenever I want to watch it I sit down and I watch it skipping all of the ads along the way.

468
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:16,018
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

469
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,852
Speaker 0: now there are a lot of arguments one way or another but the the

470
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:20,756
Speaker 1: fact

471
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:40,456
Speaker 0: is that Me downloading a fan sub and watching it and then not watching that fan sub again and not buying the DVDs is no different Than me TiVo in a show Not watching the ads and then not keeping it or buying the DVD or ever watching it again because the same amount of money changes hands regardless.

472
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:47,023
Speaker 0: and in fact you could argue that the TiVo solution while perfectly legal is more fraudulent.

473
00:30:47,063 --> 00:31:00,179
Speaker 0: because now the only way that show is still making money off the TV is if the Advertisers are fooled into thinking that I saw those ads that I clearly did that starts a whole nother show about how and we're selling Ads is all about lying to people.

474
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:04,217
Speaker 0: Well, especially when it comes to television ads because you can just skip them.

475
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:06,415
Speaker 0: You don't have to watch them Yeah, and I don't yep.

476
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:10,395
Speaker 0: So, all right all the ways I have a watching anime.

477
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,300
Speaker 0: Let's go one step further.

478
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:14,015
Speaker 0: Let's say a show is really good and I buy it cuz.

479
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:14,920
Speaker 0: I really like it.

480
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,467
Speaker 0: All right I bought Eska flown at pretty much no one I know Bought Eska flown a. you want to know why?

481
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,199
Speaker 0: because I lent my copy to everyone who wanted to see it.

482
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:25,995
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with that right or Evangelion.

483
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:26,679
Speaker 0: we own it, right?

484
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:35,526
Speaker 0: Only one person in the entire front row crew needs to own any anime ever because we'll all just lend each other DVDs or we'll all Get together and have a marathon.

485
00:31:35,747 --> 00:31:37,395
Speaker 1: Oh, but you know most anime fans.

486
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:37,837
Speaker 1: who loses?

487
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,420
Speaker 1: no friends?

488
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:41,780
Speaker 1: So basically it's because people are going to conventions and making friends.

489
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:47,800
Speaker 1: That's ruining the anime industry because they can still have to sell less DVDs But everyone's a troubled loner like comic book fans.

490
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,912
Speaker 1: They can sell more copies because they have no one to share with.

491
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:52,042
Speaker 0: cuz I can say one thing at RIT I remember.

492
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:57,238
Speaker 0: All right, someone would like have money and they'd buy an anime DVD from media play for like 25 bucks, right?

493
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,369
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

494
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,220
Speaker 0: They would then watch that anime DVD multiple times in lounges with crowds like 10 or 15 people every time.

495
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,405
Speaker 0: So none of those people had to.

496
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:09,708
Speaker 1: this is this is when an anime DVD was like a new thing like oh my god It's on DVD.

497
00:32:09,748 --> 00:32:13,770
Speaker 0: I can't believe it and I guess the point that I could get.

498
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:27,118
Speaker 0: there's a lot of other ways I can watch anime But every single way that I can watch anime except one of them is perfectly legal Perfectly legitimate and in no way gives any substantial amount of money to any anime producer or creator.

499
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,100
Speaker 0: Yep So there's a problem here because I I'm arguably a huge anime fan.

500
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:34,279
Speaker 0: I love anime.

501
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:42,505
Speaker 0: I I've seen you ten like seven times because it's like this amazing show and cowboy bebop and eskaflowne and all the half of those Lupin movies.

502
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:45,156
Speaker 1: No, but let's say like you like the spice and wolf show, right?

503
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,160
Speaker 0: I really like spice.

504
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:52,940
Speaker 1: What if the only way to get it at all was to buy the DVDs for like 15 bucks each for like?

505
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,548
Speaker 1: Four or five episodes?

506
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:55,817
Speaker 1: would you buy it?

507
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:03,269
Speaker 0: See the thing is I bought eskaflowne because I could buy the whole box set for $23 because it was on sale.

508
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,933
Speaker 0: Hmm.

509
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:09,122
Speaker 0: I bought Evangeline Because I could buy the whole series for $30.

510
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:13,018
Speaker 1: So even a huge anime fan with plenty did this all anecdotal.

511
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,949
Speaker 1: but you know This is a speculation show here right?

512
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,483
Speaker 1: a huge anime fan Who's not?

513
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:21,460
Speaker 1: some high school kid with no money someone with a real job and lots of money, right?

514
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:29,255
Speaker 1: Arguably, you don't have enough free time to spend in the anime and that probably would change things But you're only willing to spend $23 for an entire anime series.

515
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:30,078
Speaker 0: Oh, it's even worse.

516
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,649
Speaker 0: All right master Keaton master Keaton is one of those shows.

517
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:37,581
Speaker 0: when I say those shows I get to that because I think this is the car of the Problem.

518
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:43,340
Speaker 0: but master Keaton is a show where there is with one exception that exception being the Cali man of the desert.

519
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:53,680
Speaker 0: There is no reason to ever watch an episode of master Keaton more than once Mmm, because everything the said the drama the suspense and everything is gone.

520
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,745
Speaker 0: It's like bleached Naruto.

521
00:33:54,765 --> 00:34:00,780
Speaker 0: the shelves are good, but you've seen an episode, you know, what happened You know how it was resolved and they're not the kind of show.

522
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,184
Speaker 0: They're like a TV show in America.

523
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:16,757
Speaker 0: you watch an episode and other than the crazy rare amazing shows like the Simpsons No one's gonna watch an episode of that again episode of master Keaton again is just boring Mmm, so I bought master Keaton Scott and I bought.

524
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:17,279
Speaker 0: I bought it.

525
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,679
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I was gonna buy but it was it from who those people with the really good DVDs.

526
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,514
Speaker 0: We bought it because it was only five dollars a disc.

527
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:26,539
Speaker 0: It was real cheap.

528
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,928
Speaker 0: and While we bought it and I'm glad I watched it.

529
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:36,472
Speaker 0: I would rather have Netflix did because I'm never gonna watch it again I'm probably going to lend or give away the entire set.

530
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:37,174
Speaker 1: Hey, it's mine.

531
00:34:37,214 --> 00:34:37,636
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

532
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:38,699
Speaker 0: You're probably gonna lend it.

533
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,592
Speaker 1: I gotta watch it all and then I can lend it.

534
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,148
Speaker 0: Yes, but after you watch it You don't care if you still have those DVDs.

535
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,315
Speaker 0: You're never gonna watch them again.

536
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,159
Speaker 1: Probably not.

537
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,605
Speaker 1: No, I mean I bought.

538
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:54,629
Speaker 1: we bought those guys Iraqi VHS's and we watch those I think twice and then But like initial D right I've watched those DVDs.

539
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:58,360
Speaker 1: how many times yeah or ask a seed how many times we watch those?

540
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,014
Speaker 0: I've seen that Gundam seed two and a half time.

541
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:03,123
Speaker 1: that cross TV series I own that I bought.

542
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:08,420
Speaker 1: I actually macross TV series because back when it first came out on DVD from anime ego.

543
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:15,509
Speaker 1: They had a pre-order for the box set of the original macross TV series subtitled only Remastered and that was like holy shit.

544
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,300
Speaker 1: This has never been something I could see ever before.

545
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:24,120
Speaker 1: You know the because I had seen Robotech but the original macross TV series, holy shit, so I was willing to pay.

546
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,920
Speaker 1: Well, it's like two hundred something dollars at the time because it was like oh my god is amazing.

547
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,514
Speaker 1: This is like my only chance in the entire universe right because I thought it was.

548
00:35:32,594 --> 00:35:37,235
Speaker 1: you know, it is something I wanted Desperately, and I thought the supply was very low.

549
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:41,580
Speaker 1: That's the amount of money I was willing to pay one up But that's not true anymore for anything.

550
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:50,355
Speaker 1: Even if you came out with something else that I desperately wanted to see in a rare ultra box set just like a blue GQ for 40 bucks the whole thing 40 bucks pretty.

551
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:54,152
Speaker 1: no not gonna happen Even though it's not a really really really want to see.

552
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:55,780
Speaker 1: cuz I've only seen one episode and I loved it.

553
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:59,460
Speaker 1: I really want to own it on DVD because I think I would watch that many times.

554
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,366
Speaker 1: I've already watched the first episode like five times.

555
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:03,091
Speaker 0: I have a worry about that show.

556
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:09,349
Speaker 0: I feel like sadly the first episode What set up expectations way too high?

557
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:12,040
Speaker 0: I don't think the show can keep up that level of awesome.

558
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:14,920
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be like the read or die OAV in terms of quality.

559
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,691
Speaker 0: It might be read or die is like crazy exception.

560
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:22,148
Speaker 0: and that it started with this level of awesome Right away that you look at it.

561
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,172
Speaker 0: You think all right.

562
00:36:23,534 --> 00:36:25,100
Speaker 0: There's no way they could keep this up.

563
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,213
Speaker 0: This is gonna turn into one of those gonzo shows.

564
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:31,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, but They kept it up and part of that was because the show was really really short.

565
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:37,000
Speaker 1: Yeah Well the project blue cheek you I think is a short OAV also or short T's very short.

566
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,289
Speaker 1: I don't think it's a lot of episodes.

567
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:45,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, but spice and wolf all right, if it was on TV, I'd watch it by T going it and That's it.

568
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 0: I would never.

569
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:46,820
Speaker 0: I would never buy the DVDs.

570
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:53,695
Speaker 0: It's definitely not gonna be a show that I'm gonna watch over and over again forever and it's gonna be timeless Unless that show really goes in a really interesting direction.

571
00:36:53,835 --> 00:36:57,133
Speaker 0: Yep, but So I'm never gonna buy the DVDs.

572
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:57,960
Speaker 0: It's not even a question.

573
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,540
Speaker 1: So because if it wasn't fansubbed, we just wouldn't watch it.

574
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,100
Speaker 1: The fansubs aren't ruining the show or causing them not to not make money.

575
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,100
Speaker 1: We're not going haha watch the fansubs instead of buying it.

576
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,820
Speaker 1: It's if there were no fansubs if their way for wasn't on TV, we just wouldn't watch it.

577
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:23,540
Speaker 0: Well, what I'm saying too is that if it were on TV, which is the best way to show a show like that They're still not really gonna make any money because I'm pretty sure that the anime make money by lying to advertise.

578
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,243
Speaker 0: that's the thing though.

579
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:31,551
Speaker 0: the the anime watching demographic probably heavy heavily overlaps with the Technological enough to know that you can skip ads in television demographic.

580
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:32,374
Speaker 1: I don't know.

581
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:34,280
Speaker 1: the Adult Swim gets enough ads to make monies.

582
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how many people watch those ads?

583
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:37,799
Speaker 1: I don't know.

584
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,010
Speaker 0: I really don't think that many people do.

585
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:44,692
Speaker 1: they still make money because they lied to the Advertisers and the advertisers still pay out because they don't know any better.

586
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,098
Speaker 0: I just I don't get it.

587
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,888
Speaker 0: But here's the thing for forget.

588
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:51,257
Speaker 0: Let's say everyone else watches the ads, but let now.

589
00:37:51,277 --> 00:37:54,140
Speaker 0: I'm not advocating this I'm just pointing it out as an interesting conundrum.

590
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,932
Speaker 0: How is now really I want to?

591
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:58,340
Speaker 0: I want all our listeners to answer this.

592
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:03,320
Speaker 0: How is me watching spice and wolf on American TV with a TiVo?

593
00:38:03,842 --> 00:38:07,697
Speaker 0: Skipping every single ad any different than watching the fans up.

594
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:11,286
Speaker 0: It's dubbed Alright, so it's worse for me.

595
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:18,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause them more money because they had to pay for that dub Whereas the subtitles didn't have to pay anything.

596
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:20,155
Speaker 1: So I'm just less.

597
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,400
Speaker 0: but think about it economically.

598
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,980
Speaker 0: I mean, what is the difference morally morals aside?

599
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,014
Speaker 0: Just think about the economics of it because all that matters in the end is the economics.

600
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:29,119
Speaker 0: and the economics are that?

601
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,757
Speaker 0: I don't think The anime industry in America is doing very well at all.

602
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:33,685
Speaker 1: No, I really don't think they are.

603
00:38:33,705 --> 00:38:43,120
Speaker 0: now what I think the primary reason and it relates to kind of everything we said is pretty simple The place they make all their money as far as we can tell is merchandising.

604
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:48,676
Speaker 0: The majority of the merchandising is for the super popular pulpy shows shown in fighting stuff.

605
00:38:48,877 --> 00:39:00,237
Speaker 0: the super popular the bleaches that sort of thing are the shows that have a million episodes that people only watch once and They're the kind of show that you watch dragon ball and you forget about.

606
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:07,813
Speaker 1: I mean There are some crazed fans who will watch Naruto again or watch Dragon Ball again You know, they'll want to own those things on DVD and watch them again and again and whatever.

607
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:12,012
Speaker 1: but most of the Naruto fans They just want to see the newest episode and go.

608
00:39:12,052 --> 00:39:12,394
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

609
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:13,118
Speaker 1: What happened this week?

610
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:13,440
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

611
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,123
Speaker 1: What happened this week?

612
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:16,013
Speaker 0: And in fact, I see a lot of these people.

613
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:23,660
Speaker 0: they'll buy like one or two DVDs But they'll buy the DVDs that have the specific episodes that were crazy awesome and they don't care about everything else.

614
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:38,120
Speaker 0: So, uh, what you've got here is a market that is based primarily on making money off of people who have no desire or incentive to buy the DVDs and Probably would just not watch anymore if they couldn't get the shows for free or very cheap.

615
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:46,834
Speaker 1: You have a product that is designed to make money by being shown on TV Weekly, you know, you're not showing it on TV weekly and you're not.

616
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:47,296
Speaker 1: well, they are.

617
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:52,153
Speaker 0: they had Naruto's on TV no, but the problem is people already saw the fan sub so I got ahead.

618
00:39:52,173 --> 00:40:01,227
Speaker 0: and then because of the the Idiocy of how the Japanese companies license anime and they're so afraid of re-importation They always make the licenses get so delayed.

619
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,755
Speaker 0: that all right by the time.

620
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:04,377
Speaker 0: All right.

621
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,260
Speaker 0: I've seen some fan subs.

622
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:12,309
Speaker 0: I like the show by the time they released in the US in English Legitimately, I'm already on episode 30 now.

623
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:13,031
Speaker 0: This is me.

624
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:15,740
Speaker 0: I don't do this, but I'm speaking from a Naruto standpoint.

625
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:18,919
Speaker 0: Why the hell am I gonna start from episode 1 again?

626
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,340
Speaker 0: I already know what happens and why the hell am I gonna wait until forever?

627
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:26,002
Speaker 0: When they bring out the next DVD past episode 30?

628
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:31,100
Speaker 0: So these kids really have no incentive other than charity to buy the DVD.

629
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,445
Speaker 1: And if they're not and if they're not a Nielsen house What does it matter?

630
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:36,599
Speaker 1: if they watch the fan sub or if they watch it on TV?

631
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,382
Speaker 1: They're gonna still.

632
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:42,040
Speaker 1: the person who's downloading the fan sub will actually probably is a is a more dedicated fan.

633
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:47,132
Speaker 1: It will probably spend more money on The Naruto headband and the merchandise and the manga and all that jazz.

634
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,100
Speaker 0: now, I don't know what to do about this.

635
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,203
Speaker 0: I mean, here's the problem.

636
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:52,330
Speaker 0: We we don't have the solution.

637
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:54,457
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone has a solution.

638
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:55,540
Speaker 1: I have some ideas.

639
00:40:55,802 --> 00:41:01,260
Speaker 0: I know I can't guarantee their solutions though I know that what the anime industry in America is doing right now is not the solution.

640
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:03,900
Speaker 0: No, but I really don't know what to do.

641
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:18,079
Speaker 0: I see no way to make money in the long run off of selling DVDs that the majority of people who Theoretically would want them are not going to buy and you can't stop the fansubbers Even if you no matter what you do, there's no way to stop it.

642
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:22,674
Speaker 1: I think the key I think the way to make money from selling DVDs is just you shouldn't?

643
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:25,486
Speaker 1: DVDs shouldn't be the primary Focus, right?

644
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,277
Speaker 1: It's like look at HBO, right.

645
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:30,499
Speaker 1: HBO She sells the DVD box sets of all their series, right?

646
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,500
Speaker 1: The Simpsons the Futurama box sets are very popular and then they sell lots of make make lots of copies, right?

647
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,420
Speaker 1: But those are primarily on TV and the DVDs are secondary.

648
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:44,419
Speaker 1: What they should do is if I was an anime licenser, right?

649
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:48,760
Speaker 1: Especially with this writers strike the TV channels are dying for content, right?

650
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,540
Speaker 1: I would push my anime series hardcore to get it in a great TV time slot with lots and lots of marketing.

651
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,002
Speaker 1: I try to.

652
00:41:56,363 --> 00:42:04,760
Speaker 1: maybe I would try to work with Japan to make a new anime that would really appeal to like the HBO Audience or something I could get on prime time or something, right?

653
00:42:05,141 --> 00:42:14,276
Speaker 1: And since I was just something I licensed from Japan and not a new thing made by writers in the US I wouldn't need to hire any writers and I could get it on TV and there be no competition and then

654
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:17,127
Speaker 0: or I think another Equally valid way with the shows.

655
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:27,849
Speaker 0: these shown in fighting shows would be to release them Subtitled because it seems like most fans are willing to just watch the subtitles Digitally online for a couple bucks an episode.

656
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:30,440
Speaker 1: Well, they do do that sometime kinda now.

657
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:36,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not not as it's coming out in Japan not as quick as the fan suppers, which isn't good enough for these kids.

658
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,519
Speaker 0: It's got to be right away or there's gonna watch the fan sub.

659
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:42,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, the probably the Japanese companies don't seem to ever want to have that.

660
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,868
Speaker 1: but if you put the show on TV you get your money because all these Advertisers give you all this money because they don't know any better.

661
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:50,774
Speaker 0: What if all the anime fans just Tivo it?

662
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:59,196
Speaker 1: it won't matter because They'll buy the incredibly cheap box set because you only gonna release the season boxes just like HBO does.

663
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:01,242
Speaker 1: the DVDs are sort of The supplement.

664
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,024
Speaker 1: you put something on.

665
00:43:02,064 --> 00:43:08,579
Speaker 1: TV is primarily a TV show and then you sort of make a few extra bucks because you can Sell DVD box sets on the side.

666
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:13,696
Speaker 1: You don't make DVDs and downloads the only the primary thing because those are there.

667
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,020
Speaker 1: a supplement not a you know.

668
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,140
Speaker 1: In terms of the money-making it.

669
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,680
Speaker 0: I mean we have a bunch of other ideas too, but just in the up in the in the Interest of brevity and so I can go to bed and maybe make some dinner.

670
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:26,211
Speaker 1: I want to make my point about this not good anime anymore.

671
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:26,693
Speaker 1: Also, though.

672
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:28,340
Speaker 0: It's already gone on too long.

673
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,448
Speaker 1: No, let me make the point.

674
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,240
Speaker 0: All right, hurry up and then we're going to bed.

675
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,783
Speaker 1: I had the other.

676
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:41,078
Speaker 1: the other factor here that I've been thinking about recently is right look Anime has been around for a long time since you know, technically a longer but basically since Astro Boy anime.

677
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,674
Speaker 1: as we know it It's like late 50s early 60s, right?

678
00:43:43,694 --> 00:43:44,459
Speaker 1: It's ancient, right?

679
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,054
Speaker 1: But anime, you know took off as a as a cool thing in the US.

680
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:52,084
Speaker 1: and what like mid late 90s Ish right something like that.

681
00:43:52,665 --> 00:44:00,696
Speaker 1: and at that time when anime took off it took off because of sci-fi animes from you know, like the 80s 70s and the 80s and things like that.

682
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:07,180
Speaker 1: and When the anime got big at first they you know, they slowly licensed more and more things.

683
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:10,640
Speaker 1: But what they did is they cherry-picked the best anime from history.

684
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,370
Speaker 1: They had all this history of anime.

685
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,154
Speaker 1: and why they do?

686
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:14,180
Speaker 1: they went for the big guns.

687
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:16,059
Speaker 1: They went you know for the Robo tech action.

688
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,860
Speaker 1: They went for the gun jim action cowboy bebop Evangelion as Capone, right?

689
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:29,860
Speaker 1: They got all these great Chuck here all the great movies of anime all the Miyazaki's Akira You know all the stuff right all the good stuff is what they got.

690
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:37,500
Speaker 1: And then after they finished up getting the best of history of anime, you know, they said alright, what do we do now?

691
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,858
Speaker 1: Well, let's see what's coming out this year.

692
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:45,220
Speaker 1: You know We've already and they just they started licensing every show or almost every show every year.

693
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:52,927
Speaker 1: And the thing was is that while they were able to you know, garner fandom in a lot of those shows Most of the shows are crap.

694
00:44:52,947 --> 00:45:01,374
Speaker 1: There's maybe one even as an anime fan a big anime fan This may be one good show every few years You know, not one good show.

695
00:45:01,455 --> 00:45:01,858
Speaker 1: It's not like.

696
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:04,385
Speaker 0: well One great show.

697
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:06,190
Speaker 0: cuz there are good shows but I good show.

698
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:12,930
Speaker 1: there aren't these great shows that they I'm willing to buy on DVD maybe once every few years and movies are even rare.

699
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,299
Speaker 1: Satoshi khan makes a movie every two or three years, right?

700
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,579
Speaker 1: Miyazaki makes a movie about just as slow if not slower.

701
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:30,960
Speaker 1: There's the speed of anime production in least for the big High-quality shows that everyone loves and will remember forever and spend a lot of money on and buy DVDs of is not common.

702
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:47,975
Speaker 1: So they made a lot of money when they licensed all the greats of history all at once and now There's not a lot of new things to be licensed that are great at a fast enough rate to sort of have Constant new content making a lot more money and everyone already bought all the good stuff.

703
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,982
Speaker 1: They license before it's now What do you do?

704
00:45:50,002 --> 00:45:54,900
Speaker 0: Well now they they're selling those great shows again to try to make more money.

705
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good idea.

706
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:58,777
Speaker 1: cuz I'm buying cowboy bebop, you know now that it's gonna be a $30 box set.

707
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:09,307
Speaker 0: But so basically what it comes down to is fans like us people who are really really in anime really have no incentive to buy Anime DVDs or anime merchandise.

708
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:12,436
Speaker 0: and yet we're not breaking any laws or pirating either.

709
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:15,017
Speaker 0: So as a result What do you do?

710
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:22,200
Speaker 0: If you're if your biggest fans are no longer a source of income you're you're kind of screwed.

711
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.
