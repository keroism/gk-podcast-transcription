1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,410
Speaker 0: It's Monday June 18.

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,892
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:15,320
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:19,280
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about my new computer.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,377
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:38,985
Speaker 0: So I was all set to talk about how I got to leave work early because the power went out in Yonkers probably because it was the first hot day and Everyone's air conditioning was on, but

7
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:44,360
Speaker 1: I'll tell you there's nothing people love more in New York in the tri-state area than blackouts.

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,945
Speaker 1: We love black out.

9
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,434
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz nothing bad ever happens during a blackout.

10
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:49,116
Speaker 0: No siree.

11
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:49,577
Speaker 1: Nope.

12
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,586
Speaker 1: It's awesome Everyone gets to go home Everyone has a big laugh.

13
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,191
Speaker 1: It's a nice change of pace.

14
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,596
Speaker 1: It makes the day exciting.

15
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:57,740
Speaker 1: It's way cool.

16
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:01,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I remember during the big Northeast power outage the biggest problem.

17
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:06,439
Speaker 0: I mean I got home from work just fine, and I just sit in my house, and I think all right This is gonna be fun.

18
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:14,717
Speaker 0: I directed traffic for a while started getting dark and went home And then I went to eat and I realized that I didn't have any food except food that needed cooking.

19
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:15,620
Speaker 0: that's fine.

20
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:24,840
Speaker 0: I got a gas stove, and I turn it on and I realized that Oh Electric ignition yeah, even with a gas stove you could light it with like a lighter.

21
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:29,479
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah a lighter or a match or something, but there weren't any in the house.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,047
Speaker 1: Well, you can go to the store and get some.

23
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:37,673
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, so uh I went to the store and They were all closed because they didn't have any electricity gas stations open.

24
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:42,114
Speaker 0: uh gas station wouldn't sell anything Because they didn't have any electricity to run their stuff.

25
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:43,965
Speaker 0: They would not take money They would not sell things.

26
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:46,660
Speaker 1: there are some places that are that will stay open in a blackout.

27
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:49,034
Speaker 0: I couldn't find any and after an hour.

28
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:53,479
Speaker 0: I went back home I opened a can of cold ravioli, and I ate it and then I went to sleep.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,433
Speaker 0: They wouldn't even sell me anything at all.

30
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:02,239
Speaker 0: I walked into the gas station And I was like at least maybe this is why looting is so rampant.

31
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:07,554
Speaker 0: uh Yeah, because I really needed to buy that 42 inch gas plasma.

32
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:11,264
Speaker 0: Just as the power went out Exactly, but uh no.

33
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,935
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about that because a little while ago.

34
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,439
Speaker 0: I almost burned the house down.

35
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,600
Speaker 1: Why why did you almost burn the house down?

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,080
Speaker 0: Well you see we have a lot of computers in our house too many.

37
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:30,540
Speaker 0: We have more computers than we have need for at this point Which is great because I love that but fortunately I think someone out there might need a computer.

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,323
Speaker 1: We should get rid of one.

39
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:42,459
Speaker 0: well see the thing is I've realized now that there's a law in the universe that states that if Rim and Scott have too many computers Catastrophe will befall one of them in short order thus restoring balance to the force.

40
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:48,759
Speaker 1: well I would argue that catastrophe had already befallen this computer Probably twice two or three times at least.

41
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:53,473
Speaker 0: The long story short is we had one computer called Jameson because it was a mother board.

42
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:54,415
Speaker 1: it had a $20 motherboard.

43
00:02:56,602 --> 00:03:00,239
Speaker 0: It was in a case that was basically cursed in many ways.

44
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:01,222
Speaker 0: It caught.

45
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:11,860
Speaker 1: we replaced everything in that case except the case and the power supply and it caused the same problem With two different computers, so uh we used it as our Skype box.

46
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,946
Speaker 0: I kept it next to my computer because you can't easily record Skype and Linux And I have the nice mixer.

47
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:23,999
Speaker 0: so I especially when my old computer was slow I just have this little box here and it would take care of the Skype and we could do whatever we wanted to do get people on interview them.

48
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,384
Speaker 0: and I had my new computer.

49
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:31,824
Speaker 0: so I cleaned up my room redid my desk put it all back together and today in the AC since I got home from work really early.

50
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:39,615
Speaker 0: I decided to plug good old Jameson back in and set him back up at the Skype box Now that my cables were all nice and cable tied.

51
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:50,131
Speaker 0: so I stick him down there I plug him in I turn him on I plug him into my monitor And I look and sure enough it notices that the disc hasn't been fished in a while And it was mounted a bunch of times because I kept using that USB thing.

52
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:52,400
Speaker 0: so it starts fisking the disc and I go downstairs.

53
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:55,208
Speaker 0: An hour later Scott comes home all right.

54
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,553
Speaker 0: Let's go get a p.o.

55
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:56,914
Speaker 0: Box.

56
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:57,496
Speaker 0: We need a p.o.

57
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:58,440
Speaker 0: Box and all that business.

58
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:09,333
Speaker 0: So we head out and just before we're about to actually leave I run up to my room to get my wallet, and I open the door to my room Which is sealed shut you know air conditioning, and I smell burning.

59
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:15,533
Speaker 0: I smell electrical fire Awesome, and I'm very well acquainted with the smell.

60
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,418
Speaker 0: due to some incidents that IBM back in the day.

61
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:21,860
Speaker 1: I'm very well acquainted the smell with many computers that set on fire.

62
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:22,539
Speaker 0: Yes.

63
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:29,380
Speaker 0: So I'm frantically going around the room looking for whatever is on fire trying to determine if this is an emergency yet or not?

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,598
Speaker 0: And I'm half debating running downstairs and just hitting the breaker before I come back up.

65
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:48,400
Speaker 0: Eventually I tracked down the smell to the computer area And I think oh no no no and I moved my mouse and my computer's fine Huh, so I hit the source button on the LCD and Jameson's not working so well anymore.

66
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,939
Speaker 1: I wonder maybe that $20 motherboard has something to do with it?

67
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:57,318
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe maybe that proceed power supply in case has something to do with it.

68
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:05,680
Speaker 0: now I was particularly worried because on Jameson's hard drive is the entirety of the archives of geek nights Awesome because Jameson was the backup.

69
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,220
Speaker 0: So uh I go down there and sure enough the smell of burning is overpowering and the case is hot to the touch.

70
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,199
Speaker 0: So I unplug it and I kind of push it out of the room.

71
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,760
Speaker 0: Good plan yeah, so it's sitting downstairs.

72
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:23,603
Speaker 0: I plugged it in a couple more times now that in a safe condition Somewhat safe.

73
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:25,952
Speaker 0: Scott left the room every time I did it to see what was wrong.

74
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,960
Speaker 0: I think it's the power supply.

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would if I had to plug it in I would have done it outside But the extension cord from far away see the thing is.

76
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,424
Speaker 0: I knew it wasn't going to explode or anything It could have.

77
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:37,267
Speaker 1: not really don't?

78
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,154
Speaker 1: we could add some capacitors going pop pop pop.

79
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 0: I've had that before it's day.

80
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,768
Speaker 0: I'm not that dangerous pretty dangerous.

81
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:45,036
Speaker 0: Not really plus the top like to avoid it.

82
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:45,799
Speaker 0: They wouldn't have gotten me.

83
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,026
Speaker 0: That's I wasn't too worried.

84
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,279
Speaker 1: I need safety goggles before I'll get close.

85
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:55,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, suffice to say that computer is now two dead and between that and my old computer shows are.

86
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,856
Speaker 0: I think we've got to pull All the relevant parts and make one computer out of them again, I think we do.

87
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,327
Speaker 0: maybe it's time I don't think the motherboard survived.

88
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,231
Speaker 0: That's just my guess.

89
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:10,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think yeah We'll probably just make a new egg order for because I'm gonna get another hard drive and RAM for my computer.

90
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,902
Speaker 0: I'll probably get a couple more hard drives to make some sort of Linux raid and then we'll buy a case for whatever We could.

91
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,794
Speaker 0: yeah, I'll buy a. probably I'll buy the second cheapest case on new egg.

92
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,440
Speaker 1: That's still a bad case.

93
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:22,899
Speaker 0: Hey, it's not the cheapest case.

94
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,033
Speaker 0: Cardboard box full of razor blades get a good one for like $40.

95
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,122
Speaker 1: That'll be actually good $40.

96
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,272
Speaker 0: That's more than twice what I spent on that computer.

97
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:34,303
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter Computers broken.

98
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:35,989
Speaker 0: so the motherboard my $40.

99
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:38,720
Speaker 1: It would be working and it would have never had a problem.

100
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:44,980
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah now despite the fact that is really hot out all my windows are open to dissipate the smell of burning.

101
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:45,315
Speaker 0: well

102
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:57,531
Speaker 1: also Because the windows might as well be open if the air conditioner is off and we turn the air conditioner off when we do the Show because it makes a lot of noise and I sit right in front of it And that means doing geek nights in the summer.

103
00:06:57,632 --> 00:07:05,663
Speaker 0: It's hella hot hella hot It's not usually the room is like 70 when we start doing the show and it only gets up to about 76 by the time We're done.

104
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:06,508
Speaker 1: I know I'm pretty high.

105
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,280
Speaker 1: I got this laptop on my lap and such.

106
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:08,824
Speaker 0: You know what?

107
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:14,280
Speaker 0: You know why you're hot cuz the air conditioning is not on Yeah, and I'm sitting in this squishy chair and yeah Yeah.

108
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:18,042
Speaker 1: But so I think in the summer the shows are gonna go Faster.

109
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:20,771
Speaker 1: just out of I want to go into my air-conditioned room.

110
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:25,528
Speaker 0: Well after the burning smell is gone from the room I'm definitely going to re-equip the air conditioning.

111
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,592
Speaker 1: good idea.

112
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,636
Speaker 0: All right.

113
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:28,740
Speaker 0: So what do you got in the news?

114
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,940
Speaker 1: This isn't so much a news because uh, there were some tech news is but I didn't really care.

115
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:34,462
Speaker 1: Is this?

116
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:37,095
Speaker 1: I don't know if this isn't even tech at all, but I don't know.

117
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:41,860
Speaker 1: I liked it Basically that some guy started a blog called unexpected truths.

118
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:49,267
Speaker 1: It was he put up one article in April and one in June and this is his second article the one from June 16th and it got dug.

119
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,164
Speaker 1: so I noticed it and It's not correct.

120
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:59,320
Speaker 1: Basically this base like I can just argue against it with one point and defeat it but it is partially correct.

121
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:11,348
Speaker 1: Basically, this guy makes an argument and he says that if you have a really hard standardized test right like stupidly hard Then it's actually less meaningful.

122
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,153
Speaker 1: and this is his logic right.

123
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:21,508
Speaker 1: his logic is this let's say I'm Scott and I know One thing about I don't know.

124
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:22,230
Speaker 1: pick a topic.

125
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,511
Speaker 1: I don't know.

126
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:28,870
Speaker 0: think about I don't know living podcasting Aerospace engineering, right?

127
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,897
Speaker 0: Let's go with quantum physics.

128
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:30,380
Speaker 1: All right quant.

129
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,347
Speaker 1: I know one thing about quantum physics, right.

130
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:42,520
Speaker 1: then you bring in another guy who's a quantum physicist and he knows I don't know five times as much as I do about quantum physics, but what happens when you multiply by zero?

131
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay Anyway, all right enough snipping.

132
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:52,879
Speaker 1: Yes, so then you give us a test right and the test has you know 100 questions, right?

133
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,060
Speaker 1: Let's say I know enough to get 10 questions, right and he knows enough to get 50 questions, right?

134
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:10,148
Speaker 1: Since it's so hard that 50 of the questions are just so hard that we can't neither of us know them then basically half the test is guessing.

135
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:28,700
Speaker 1: so a harder test like that where the knowledgeable person is Equally difficult has to guess also makes it better for me as the dumber person and that the ideal test Would be one where if you were knowledgeable you could get them All right, and if you weren't knowledgeable you would get them all wrong.

136
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:34,300
Speaker 0: Well, you see it depends because that really seems to rely on the fact that it's a limited number of multiple choice question.

137
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,700
Speaker 1: Yes, he does say this only counts in a multiple choice test where you only count the correct answers.

138
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also a lot of tests mitigate that by.

139
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:48,438
Speaker 0: you can choose not to answer a question But if you do choose to answer it you lose points if you get it wrong.

140
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,247
Speaker 1: Yeah That's the SAT used to work out of.

141
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,356
Speaker 1: it still works that I don't know the SAT works anymore.

142
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:53,060
Speaker 0: I never even took it.

143
00:09:53,542 --> 00:10:05,020
Speaker 1: Yes, but the basically the argument I mean this does sort of make sense though I mean, it's not a hundred percent correct because I could just say um, you can't really quantify human knowledge in that way.

144
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:12,984
Speaker 1: I mean obviously sure the quantum physicist doesn't know them all but he can make educated guesses on a lot of them and eliminate Multiple choices on.

145
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:18,340
Speaker 1: you know many of them which I could not do and therefore his odds of getting a better score better than mine.

146
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,780
Speaker 0: It's such plus I can relate when I was in high school in 10th grade when I took out AP biology.

147
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:24,415
Speaker 0: It was a class of like 11 people.

148
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,225
Speaker 0: It was this little seminar class.

149
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:31,405
Speaker 0: We're basically free to do whatever we wanted and the tests were Incredibly difficult.

150
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:37,163
Speaker 0: the tests were designed for someone who already had a degree in biology or saw, you know The relevant field.

151
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,126
Speaker 0: so we're talking about genetics.

152
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:43,240
Speaker 0: then it was that super hard about genetics and the class average was always around 30%.

153
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:55,281
Speaker 0: yep, and all it really did was force everyone to like you really had to strive for a lot more than you actually needed to Because by the end of the class we were averaging around 50%.

154
00:10:55,281 --> 00:11:03,577
Speaker 0: So when we went to take the actual AP test We were so used to these basically hammer-you-in-the-face questions that we all got fives on the test like that.

155
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:15,930
Speaker 0: Ah But then again, that means that doesn't mean that the tests we took in the class were really a useful measure of intelligence because it was generally a useful measure of Intelligent guessing like Scott was saying.

156
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:21,909
Speaker 1: Yes, but regardless they While his Argument is not 100% correct.

157
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:28,914
Speaker 1: I do think that you know incredibly Stupidly difficult tests are sort of not good at measuring intelligence.

158
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:43,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, at least to a point Yeah, but I would make the opposite argument that you don't want to test especially if you're trying to differentiate between people of varying skill That has too low of a cap because then you can't differentiate between people who are very intelligent.

159
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:48,820
Speaker 1: That's why what I would do if I was making a test two rounds, no, no, oh two rounds is okay.

160
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:53,280
Speaker 1: I would make the first question right the easiest possible question, right?

161
00:11:53,641 --> 00:12:05,219
Speaker 1: And I would make the last question the hardest possible question And that way you would basically everyone would start failing at a certain point along the way and maybe I would shut randomize them You know instead of doing them in order.

162
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:15,441
Speaker 1: but basically when I did the grading I could Shuffle them and look at them from easy to hard and then just look at your score is like a line with maybe some holes In it.

163
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:20,020
Speaker 1: if you messed up on a few problems and then you could really see okay, that guy's a friggin genius.

164
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,799
Speaker 1: He got all the ones near the end.

165
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:31,140
Speaker 1: Okay That guy only made it a third of the way through instead of having this test where half the questions are Impossible and basic, you know like that where it's pretty useless.

166
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Speaker 0: Well, actually another example just from my high school in AP physics.

167
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:43,359
Speaker 0: The way he did it was there'd always be ten questions on a test But you had a very short amount of time to actually do the test and you weren't expected to complete them all.

168
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,284
Speaker 0: they were Multiple choice.

169
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:51,156
Speaker 0: each one was a very complex, you know physics problem Yeah, and there were ten and you could choose which ones to just do whichever ones you can.

170
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:54,974
Speaker 0: that way he made that so difficult and not enough time.

171
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:58,264
Speaker 0: to where the loadout of the scores.

172
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:03,947
Speaker 0: the way the scores were disseminated at the end very much reflected how Proficient everyone was in the class.

173
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:04,870
Speaker 0: It was a very good measure.

174
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,760
Speaker 0: I think yeah, like I was so at one time I got six right and I was like crazy.

175
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,474
Speaker 0: There's this one kid who got eight once like four years before we got there.

176
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,116
Speaker 0: Yeah.

177
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,600
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, I just thought it was pretty interesting and this does look like a blog to me.

178
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,454
Speaker 1: That's pretty much trying to become popular and I don't know.

179
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:24,680
Speaker 1: he wrote two things.

180
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,020
Speaker 0: I didn't read the first thing he wrote but maybe he is taking these strategy that I used to take posting on slashdot.

181
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,628
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just a blogspot blog from some guy.

182
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,095
Speaker 1: So whatever a link to it.

183
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:35,436
Speaker 1: Why not?

184
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:49,900
Speaker 0: See, you know lately I found that whenever a blog talks about something like that or whenever they bring up a topic or a question I never bother reading the blog because I see the question on dig if it was an interesting question And I just read the dig comments and I probably get more out of it.

185
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:51,305
Speaker 1: See actually that would.

186
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:59,175
Speaker 1: that would have bitten me in this case because on dig the headline was the fallacy of hard tests And I thought it was gonna be about how the tests aren't really

187
00:13:59,216 --> 00:13:59,617
Speaker 0: hard,

188
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:06,280
Speaker 1: you know Like oh everyone says this is so hard to test but it's not and you can actually just pass the tests and blood or bullshit.

189
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,977
Speaker 1: And then I read it and that's not what it was about.

190
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:13,896
Speaker 0: Nah So a while ago we talked about a judge who didn't really know what a website was.

191
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,465
Speaker 1: Oh The lady in Connecticut.

192
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,411
Speaker 0: Alright, so arguments aside from that.

193
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:19,234
Speaker 0: No, no, no, not that.

194
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,240
Speaker 1: Oh the other one the Irish English one.

195
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,439
Speaker 0: Well, this is the other other one.

196
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:32,387
Speaker 0: okay, so I'm just gonna read the slash dot bit here because I think it says it all in an impressive example of the gap of understanding between legal officials and technology.

197
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:46,360
Speaker 0: US magistrate some woman found that a computer servers RAM or Random access memory if you will if I may is a tangible document that can be stored and must be turned over in a lawsuit.

198
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,353
Speaker 1: Now there he can have it now.

199
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,800
Speaker 0: think about this for a minute.

200
00:14:51,101 --> 00:15:07,700
Speaker 1: This judge is basically saying that you have to turn over the contents of your RAM Because there's evidence contents of the RAM or the actual RAM because it is possible to copy the data that is presently in the RAM To like a CD or something or DVD.

201
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker 0: That is equally useless because the the data in the RAM is transient and I highly doubt that the court Proceeding is taking place at a time where whatever data they wanted is still in RAM.

202
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:26,174
Speaker 1: I know that but it is possible to Take a snapshot of the current data in RAM if that is useful plus while I didn't.

203
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:37,026
Speaker 1: for example you could but potentially set up a computer or with a service that logs to a space in RAM and Maybe it doesn't log that much.

204
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:45,465
Speaker 1: or maybe you have so much RAM that you can hold on to those logs and thus a snapshot Of that RAM would be something you might want to put in Possible.

205
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:49,260
Speaker 0: I couldn't read the article because it was slash dotted and I didn't want to really search for it.

206
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:57,400
Speaker 0: All right, but it seems that the judge really doesn't understand and think so I think that's obvious that they can get the data that they want from the RAM.

207
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
Speaker 0: They're mad because torrents by according to them doesn't keep records.

208
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:09,480
Speaker 0: So I guess the judge must have found out about RAM and said well Wouldn't the data be in there because it has to be in there at some point not understanding that it's not there anymore.

209
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,540
Speaker 1: Well, all I can say is where the hell were the expert witnesses, you know, I wonder that more and more every day.

210
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:18,160
Speaker 1: Maybe there aren't any expert witnesses.

211
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,348
Speaker 0: Well when it comes to computers Because I ran into the situation today there aren't.

212
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:27,890
Speaker 1: I would love the job of expert witness flying around the country going to courts getting Asked today at work.

213
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,880
Speaker 0: It's not that I realize this is a problem.

214
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,420
Speaker 0: It's more that I ran into this problem again.

215
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,600
Speaker 0: But it seems like almost every IT problem in the corporate world comes down to a very simple problem.

216
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:41,749
Speaker 0: You have a customer and you have the technologists.

217
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:48,530
Speaker 0: the customer wants X, but they don't know about technology But they want some sort of technology to do their job.

218
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:53,919
Speaker 0: the technologists know how to make technology But they don't know anything about the customer or the customers job.

219
00:16:54,482 --> 00:17:02,260
Speaker 0: So the customer says say I want to be able to print these documents and the tech guy says fine And he gives them a printer but it might not be the mark kind of printer.

220
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:19,420
Speaker 0: The tech guy will often solve the wrong problem because the customer doesn't understand the technology enough to know what to ask for and there don't seem to be any people out there or at least very few of them who are capable of Talking to the customer talking to the technologist figuring out what needs to be done and writing it down.

221
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:22,660
Speaker 1: Well, you see that's actually they taught us in school to do that.

222
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,663
Speaker 0: Oh They taught us to.

223
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:32,200
Speaker 1: the problem is not that we're incapable of doing that like if I go To someone's business and I take a look at it for a little while maybe hang out for an hour.

224
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,448
Speaker 1: So see how they are their business process.

225
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,294
Speaker 1: I know figure out what they need.

226
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,880
Speaker 1: I'm not I understand business enough.

227
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:45,148
Speaker 1: The problem is is that in the actual business world while we were taught to do that in school No one else does know how to do it.

228
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,718
Speaker 1: people just don't do it.

229
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,331
Speaker 1: They think you go and a customer just comes up and says something and it's like wait I want to talk to you about this and figure out what you need.

230
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,235
Speaker 1: Just give me something.

231
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:57,129
Speaker 1: this I'm like, no You're not gonna be happy.

232
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,738
Speaker 1: All right, I'll give it to you.

233
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:03,680
Speaker 1: But if you complain you got you can't say anything you promised me right now on paper.

234
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:20,315
Speaker 0: Maybe that's cuz the kind of companies you work for but it's the opposite with me In the like IBM and these other companies where you know There's a customer and they want something big from the company or they want some big technology thing And they need something to do their job and they know what they want But the technology is just aren't willing to listen or figure out what they need.

235
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:29,680
Speaker 1: I think those technologists I think that's a problem that people have realized and The older technologists who have gone to school or much older than we are in their 30s and 40s didn't learn this.

236
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:37,348
Speaker 1: Yeah and then they began teaching it once they realized it was a problem because I'm basically the now because The older people are still the old way.

237
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,576
Speaker 1: There's we're not doing it even though we know how.

238
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,824
Speaker 0: yeah because I'm now I'm basically the fireman.

239
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:51,619
Speaker 0: I go around the company putting out the fires when they start and the fires are always always always Customer got what they didn't want because no one bothered to listen to them.

240
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,614
Speaker 0: But when it comes to these I mean, I mean there are.

241
00:18:55,714 --> 00:19:01,922
Speaker 1: there are many cases I will not deny you tech people out there of incredibly stupid customers Can't deal with.

242
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:07,179
Speaker 0: however, the easy answer is what you want is not feasible and all and of course the tech guy is never stupid.

243
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:16,363
Speaker 0: But I think the best answer to this sort of thing is to take the RAM chips and bring them into court and hand them To the judge.

244
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:16,907
Speaker 1: Yeah.

245
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:18,658
Speaker 1: I also think that is the best way to do it.

246
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:18,900
Speaker 1: now.

247
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,360
Speaker 0: It does remind me back when Scott and I were younger and more full of vim and vigor.

248
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:31,724
Speaker 0: We were trying to figure out how we could Like how we could mess with computer forensics people and we realized that if you wanted to commit some sort of piracy Internet crime.

249
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:38,859
Speaker 0: Oh, this is a great plan the best way to go about it, and I'm really surprised No one has done this yet, or if they have it hasn't been publicized.

250
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:43,200
Speaker 0: So we're basically gonna tell you all and I'm not saying you should do this.

251
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,036
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm going to say on the record This is one of those things where it's okay to put bomb instructions on the internet But it's not okay to might make bombs or blow them up.

252
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,226
Speaker 1: Yes This is what we're about to tell you.

253
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:55,153
Speaker 0: we're trusting you guys because I?

254
00:19:55,614 --> 00:20:02,137
Speaker 1: well I think the main reason is no Seriously go and actually do this because then we will get insane publicity when the news finds out.

255
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:04,364
Speaker 1: they learned how to do it From some podcast.

256
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yet don't actually do it.

257
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,874
Speaker 0: So I can't get sued exactly.

258
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:08,717
Speaker 0: You see how that works.

259
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:24,320
Speaker 0: Yes, but all that aside we realized that if you wanted to give data to people or put data out there of any kind that is illicit or Insightful or in any way would want to be stopped by the man or your government or whoever.

260
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,940
Speaker 0: This is probably a great idea for dissidents in China.

261
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:36,018
Speaker 0: Yep, what you do is you take laptops particularly you got to buy second-hand laptops with cash But that's not hard to do with wireless cards cheap-ass ones.

262
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,509
Speaker 0: now You get a big old battery and stick it to the thing.

263
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:47,634
Speaker 1: or if you can or you find somewhere where there's an outlet in Public like if you open up the bottom of a street lamp, there's usually an outlet in there Yep, or you can wire in and get power if you're smart.

264
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,838
Speaker 0: It's not that hard to do Yep.

265
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:57,049
Speaker 0: So what you do is you take this little laptop with its wireless card and no hard drive no hard drive No fingerprints, obviously all that stuff.

266
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,256
Speaker 0: You took the serial numbers off.

267
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:01,270
Speaker 0: Not that that matters Yep, so you run whatever.

268
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,420
Speaker 0: you make sure it's within sight of an access point.

269
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,485
Speaker 0: So it'll get on the internet.

270
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:07,219
Speaker 0: somehow you make a live CD.

271
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, a live CD that contains an operating system designed solely to do whatever it is you want to do.

272
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:15,530
Speaker 0: Maybe you take a not big CD.

273
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:24,729
Speaker 1: you put an Apache on it, whatever But you don't let it actually you don't set it to automatically do whatever it's gonna do on boot because then by Examining the CD they can figure you out.

274
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:30,951
Speaker 0: Now what you do is you boot this CD yep, and the CD now loads what it's doing into RAM.

275
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:36,607
Speaker 1: then you perform the critical steps via the keyboard and All everything is in the RAM.

276
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:50,719
Speaker 1: you close the lid and as soon as you close the lid You have it rigged in such a way that opening the lid or turning it off or rebooting it or opening The CD drive will just turn the computer off and furthermore you remove the CD.

277
00:21:51,302 --> 00:22:02,140
Speaker 0: Just in case though if you wanted to do it optimally the CD is just a straight-up Live CD with nothing on it because you guys say you did everything with a flash drive and then you take the flash drive away.

278
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:11,350
Speaker 1: So basically everything that's illicit that's going on is in the RAM of that computer and no one can figure out where the computer came from or who's doing it or anything.

279
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:14,525
Speaker 1: and the most they can do is just Pick up the computer.

280
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:21,374
Speaker 1: and as soon as they pick up the computer and if they try to do any sort of research on it Whatsoever forensics, they're not gonna find shit now.

281
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:22,700
Speaker 0: even better a lot of pcs.

282
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:26,919
Speaker 0: It's pretty trivial to set up a PC that if it's jostled it'll turn off or do something.

283
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,264
Speaker 0: Yep That's one step further.

284
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:38,135
Speaker 1: The thing is if it's a laptop like sitting on the street outside of a like Cafe using the free wireless then it's probably gonna.

285
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:39,860
Speaker 1: well no cuz you jostled on its own.

286
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:46,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, but someone's gonna steal it anyway, yeah But in that case that's for like the quick spy handoff where you leave the laptop there Like you're sitting at the Starbucks.

287
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:47,820
Speaker 0: make sure you're wearing a hat.

288
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,839
Speaker 0: No one can see your face on the cameras to leave it there.

289
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:53,133
Speaker 0: Someone walks by gets the data wirelessly while he's walking.

290
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:53,374
Speaker 1: Yep.

291
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,840
Speaker 1: See the problem with this plan, right?

292
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,304
Speaker 1: There's only one problem with it.

293
00:22:56,364 --> 00:23:01,340
Speaker 1: And that is that it's very uneconomical to get all these laptops.

294
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:03,889
Speaker 0: Well, there is another way but the the way.

295
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:06,317
Speaker 1: that's why everyone does things via Windows.

296
00:23:06,337 --> 00:23:07,100
Speaker 1: zombies, right?

297
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:18,580
Speaker 1: But the zombies have to start somewhere and starting them from one of these anonymous laptops is a great way to go Especially if it started with a cron job that takes place like three weeks after you left the thing there.

298
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:21,320
Speaker 1: Well, then you have to bet that it's gonna sit there for three weeks.

299
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a. hide it pretty well now if you're gonna has to have a three week battery.

300
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:35,474
Speaker 0: Yeah now if you wanted to host a whole bunch of data or something big You rent an apartment with cash in a shady part of town and you get internet stolen from your neighbor Which is not that hard to do usually.

301
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:35,878
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

302
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:39,916
Speaker 0: And then you just have a server and you have the server rigged up the same way.

303
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:43,380
Speaker 0: live CD Maybe a gigantic amount of RAM to hold the data.

304
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,533
Speaker 0: They should need that much because I can't imagine how much data it would be.

305
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,862
Speaker 0: you can get a lot of RAM and you rigged The house up.

306
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:51,813
Speaker 0: So if any entrance to the house is open, it cuts the power to the computer.

307
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:52,957
Speaker 1: Nice.

308
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,111
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Imagine the forensics guy trying to explain that to the judge.

309
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,478
Speaker 0: There was nothing in the computer.

310
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:00,623
Speaker 0: your honor What do you mean?

311
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:04,438
Speaker 0: we see clearly that it was serving the battle plans to the Death Star?

312
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,586
Speaker 1: Yeah But there was nothing in it.

313
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:07,389
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

314
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:07,730
Speaker 0: Nothing?

315
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:08,232
Speaker 0: Nothing.

316
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:22,680
Speaker 0: many both inside trying to get that Things of the day again, I'll be real brief.

317
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,611
Speaker 0: I don't have a lot to say about this other than that.

318
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,100
Speaker 0: I think it's really neat now.

319
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,364
Speaker 0: Sculpture is one thing.

320
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:29,090
Speaker 0: you make a sculpture to look like something.

321
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,414
Speaker 0: Maybe it's some abstract thing.

322
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:31,959
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a big naked guy.

323
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:33,987
Speaker 1: I was gonna do that.

324
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:34,911
Speaker 0: You were gonna do that joke.

325
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,076
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I already did it.

326
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:36,980
Speaker 0: It's done.

327
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:38,366
Speaker 0: It's taken naked.

328
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:39,972
Speaker 0: Greek guy is already out there in the open.

329
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:41,599
Speaker 0: There's nothing you can do about him.

330
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:44,500
Speaker 0: All right, all right, but and that's well and good.

331
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:51,120
Speaker 0: But what if instead of the sculpture being the art the shadow the sculpture cast worthy art now?

332
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,906
Speaker 0: You might say rim.

333
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,915
Speaker 0: That's so like Avant-garde nouveau whatever term crap modern garbage art.

334
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,340
Speaker 0: That's not anything interesting.

335
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:05,920
Speaker 0: Now what if you made Something a physical object that didn't in and of itself look like anything?

336
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:07,720
Speaker 0: In fact, it looks like a pile of trash.

337
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:15,630
Speaker 0: but if you shine a light on it in a certain way the shadow it casts is Nothing like the object and in fact is a work of art.

338
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:16,814
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

339
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:17,657
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

340
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:18,420
Speaker 0: That's what this is.

341
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,666
Speaker 0: That's all I have to say about that.

342
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:24,486
Speaker 1: All right, my thing of the day is a Simple astronomy picture.

343
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:28,780
Speaker 1: Well, actually it is a conglomeration of many astronomy pictures.

344
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:31,300
Speaker 1: You see you look up at the Sun, right?

345
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,192
Speaker 1: And you know that if it's noon The Sun is directly overhead and you have no shadow.

346
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:37,686
Speaker 1: and if it's early in the day The Sun is in the east.

347
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:38,774
Speaker 1: it was later in the day.

348
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:39,579
Speaker 1: The Sun is in the West.

349
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:46,270
Speaker 1: You know that in the summer the Sun takes longer to go across because the earth tilts and in the winter It takes less time to go across.

350
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:47,820
Speaker 1: and all that business, right?

351
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,959
Speaker 1: well, what if you had a camera pointed at the sky and the camera didn't move?

352
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:58,734
Speaker 1: and Like every day you had the camera take a picture of the sky at say 10

353
00:25:58,734 --> 00:25:58,774
Speaker 1: a.m.?

354
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:01,040
Speaker 1: Just pick a time, right?

355
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:14,600
Speaker 1: You can see all the different places in the sky where the Sun will be at 10 a.m Every day around the year and it sort of makes this like eight like this figure eight or like the infinity.

356
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,620
Speaker 1: It's kind of angular, you know.

357
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,553
Speaker 1: and like one day the Sun will be really low at 10 a.m.

358
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:22,424
Speaker 1: and then the other end of the year the Sun will be Really high at 10 a.m.

359
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:37,019
Speaker 1: And the shape that it creates in the sky is called the Analemma and here is a picture of the Analemma and They list the dates when the pictures are taken and everything and it's pretty cool and you learn something new.

360
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,410
Speaker 0: So it's been long enough and it's finally up.

361
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,520
Speaker 0: So I guess it's time to talk a little about my new computer.

362
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:46,591
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a cop-out episode.

363
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:47,799
Speaker 0: I think yeah a little bit.

364
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:51,740
Speaker 0: We actually put it in the schedule a while ago and we ended up you put it in the schedule.

365
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you agreed to it.

366
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,714
Speaker 1: I just I didn't agree outright.

367
00:26:55,854 --> 00:26:57,360
Speaker 1: I just did not object.

368
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,336
Speaker 0: Well, the main reason we put it in originally was all right.

369
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:01,000
Speaker 0: I got a new computer.

370
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,980
Speaker 0: we should talk about new hardware or whatever and You might notice that it's been quite some time since I got that new computer and we're doing this episode.

371
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:11,218
Speaker 0: The computer is just now working as it should be.

372
00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:15,494
Speaker 1: Alright, well, let's talk about what parts you got for that computer.

373
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:17,280
Speaker 0: Alright, well, of course the only relevant parts.

374
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:25,536
Speaker 0: well, I got a core to duo e 6600 which I still believe is the absolute perfect price point in terms of diminishing returns.

375
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:26,579
Speaker 0: dollar per unit.

376
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:32,896
Speaker 1: performance Yes If you have a lot of money like a pile of money Go out and get the faster one because this is not the fastest one available.

377
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:40,465
Speaker 1: if you can afford it There's better ones, but if you're gonna save money, but you still need if you're gonna just save money You don't care about performance that much.

378
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:45,060
Speaker 1: you can get like the core non two duos and like the core one duos and for real.

379
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:52,140
Speaker 1: But if you are looking to get performance and the money saving at the same time, this is still the best spot.

380
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,391
Speaker 1: I still I can't believe I turn my back on AMD.

381
00:27:56,201 --> 00:28:06,820
Speaker 0: AMD has been with me for a long time and I never thought that Intel would have a better chip or a cheaper chip because Intel was always just so ludicrously expensive and not that much faster.

382
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:09,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I wavered back and forth.

383
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,380
Speaker 1: I mean originally I got Intel because AMD was nothing in those days.

384
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,126
Speaker 0: Well, yeah back in like the k3 days.

385
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:16,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like before even the k2 days.

386
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:17,397
Speaker 1: Yeah.

387
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:26,953
Speaker 1: Well the k6 like 1999 yeah, and then AMD just came out and really caught were faster and cheaper bitches and I was like, oh, yeah It wasn't just a little bit cheaper.

388
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,365
Speaker 0: It was like $300 cheaper and twice as fast.

389
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was AMD for the win.

390
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:37,860
Speaker 1: and then I was stuck with AMD cuz they maintain their cheapness and their competitiveness.

391
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:43,180
Speaker 1: But then and Intel also sort of went down the tubes with their Pentium 4. it was not good.

392
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:48,285
Speaker 1: But then luckily this one R&D team at Intel Basically bailed them out.

393
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:51,976
Speaker 1: and the story is like some Israeli R&D team invented the core.

394
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:56,058
Speaker 1: do the core Basically, and then they core solo the core duo, etc, etc.

395
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,737
Speaker 1: And now AMD not keeping up they're trying to do their 64-bit thing.

396
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,658
Speaker 1: But that's not working out so well because the 64-bit OS is they're not so hot.

397
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:08,168
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean god, I tried to use Ubuntu.

398
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:09,012
Speaker 0: Well, I'll get to that.

399
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,622
Speaker 0: That's a whole other adventure gonna get to that We'll get to that.

400
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:17,547
Speaker 1: All right, but there's one constant even though Intel and AMD may change Nvidia is always the wind.

401
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:20,138
Speaker 0: Yep, but luckily I mean the thing that really pushed it over.

402
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:24,451
Speaker 0: because Literally the day before I bought my computer on Newegg.

403
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:27,940
Speaker 0: There was a gigantic sale on AMD processors.

404
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,419
Speaker 0: They were so cheap.

405
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:35,399
Speaker 0: ah and I still just couldn't rationalize it because the core 2 seems like it has so much future potential.

406
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:43,040
Speaker 0: and If it comes to it in the future I actually looked and I could overclock this thing like four years from now to keep this computer going a while.

407
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:45,940
Speaker 1: I don't think that's going to be necessary, but it is that much better.

408
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:49,940
Speaker 0: Yes, because and it uses practically no power compared to the AMD.

409
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:59,814
Speaker 1: I think that's another major factor is that AMD sort of just kept increasing the horsepower Over time and didn't increase the price very much and that helped out in those days.

410
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:00,275
Speaker 0: Yep.

411
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:09,691
Speaker 0: And also I really got to say Installing the Intel chip the core 2 duo compared to other CPUs I've installed was a dream.

412
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,880
Speaker 0: It just went in so wonderfully.

413
00:30:12,081 --> 00:30:15,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's a new mechanism that's sort of complicated and foreign.

414
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:15,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it works.

415
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,048
Speaker 0: No, the pins don't go in holes anymore.

416
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,819
Speaker 0: The pin just go up against these pads and it's really nice.

417
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:25,500
Speaker 0: There's no longer is the fear of fucking up my motherboard or fucking up my processor.

418
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean it is sort of strange.

419
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:32,132
Speaker 1: if you've done a lot of you know, old-school socket CPU So much better, but it does work.

420
00:30:32,354 --> 00:30:33,239
Speaker 1: It's not some BS.

421
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,654
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not as easy as a slot but the slot had too many drawbacks.

422
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:37,960
Speaker 1: So slot is no good.

423
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:46,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also I got to say the stock default heatsink cooling mechanism that comes with the core 2 is Absolutely silent.

424
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,610
Speaker 0: It does not make noise as far as I can tell.

425
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,312
Speaker 1: that's good.

426
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:50,716
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

427
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:51,860
Speaker 0: It goes on like that.

428
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:52,342
Speaker 0: It's just.

429
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:53,225
Speaker 0: it's so easy.

430
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,433
Speaker 0: It comes with the thermal paste on it.

431
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:57,139
Speaker 0: There's no reason to replace it.

432
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:01,854
Speaker 0: I can't praise Intel highly enough for the core 2 duo.

433
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,600
Speaker 0: I'm so incredibly happy with it.

434
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:16,240
Speaker 0: anyway, yeah and motherboard wise I actually had a lot of consternation because it seems like This generation of motherboards had a lot of trouble with Linux back in a lot of trouble regardless of Linux.

435
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,073
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but Linux in particular.

436
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:18,960
Speaker 1: Yes, also Linux.

437
00:31:19,261 --> 00:31:26,489
Speaker 0: I ended up going with the a bit a b9 Pro partly because one it has ten serial ATAs Which is more than you're gonna use but two.

438
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:34,980
Speaker 0: it had three different serial ATA controllers And I figured that no matter what problems there are with Linux at least one of those bad basses is gonna work.

439
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:37,048
Speaker 0: I don't know why I said bad basses.

440
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:41,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know how it's gonna make a noise of a fish But I really didn't.

441
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:42,994
Speaker 0: I wasn't gonna say badasses.

442
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,120
Speaker 0: I don't know what I was gonna say.

443
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,666
Speaker 0: I don't know where basses came from.

444
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,615
Speaker 0: bad boys the bad boys badasses.

445
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,820
Speaker 0: I guess they got merged together.

446
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,268
Speaker 0: I guess the bad basses of computer science.

447
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:54,056
Speaker 0: bad boys asses bad, but asses.

448
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:54,478
Speaker 0: Yeah.

449
00:31:54,698 --> 00:32:17,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Yeah, it turned out that there were quite a few problems with the a bit a b9 Pro the least of which was that my computer didn't boot when I first got it at all and I couldn't believe that the awesome and tech power supply I had bought that had way more power than I need for this motherboard and all my components Wasn't a problem.

450
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:17,927
Speaker 0: there's no way.

451
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:20,395
Speaker 1: it wasn't actually the problem what it was.

452
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,120
Speaker 1: Well, it was a nation problem.

453
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:28,920
Speaker 1: Yes, it affect because the whether you know it or not pretty much any power supply you buy these days, right?

454
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,730
Speaker 1: And it's been true for many years like since the year 2001 2000. even right is that?

455
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,664
Speaker 1: computer power supplies are very smart.

456
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:45,271
Speaker 1: if you try to get a computer power supply to give you more electricity that it is capable of Giving you it will say no and turn off that way.

457
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,516
Speaker 1: It doesn't explode or anything.

458
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:47,340
Speaker 1: That is good.

459
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:51,590
Speaker 1: It's a smart power supply Newer even like super new power supplies.

460
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,380
Speaker 1: ones that you get say today what they do.

461
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:59,706
Speaker 1: They have a newer feature if you don't ask for enough power They will turn off.

462
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:06,760
Speaker 1: because if you're not asking for enough power Then something might be wrong because the computer asks for a whole bunch of power when you turn it on.

463
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,489
Speaker 0: Yep, now it appears.

464
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:15,400
Speaker 0: from what I've read and researched though I haven't verified this experimentally because I'm not the type to sit there with a voltimeter and mess with it.

465
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it from what I've seen and all the evidence.

466
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:19,217
Speaker 1: I think this is 90% the case.

467
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:22,437
Speaker 0: Yes, though There is another issue that will also get to.

468
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:32,040
Speaker 0: yeah But it seems like the a b9 and a lot of other modern motherboards Staged the activation of components in such a way as to not suddenly overburden the power supply.

469
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:45,182
Speaker 1: So instead of turning on everything in your computer at once it turns on one bit over here then a bit over there then a bit Turns in the CPU then the memory then this and that and the result of that is you don't ask the power supply for enough Power.

470
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:49,078
Speaker 1: so the power supply starts turning on your computer and then it turns off.

471
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,936
Speaker 0: Yep No, I mean that's the guess I've seen.

472
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:52,520
Speaker 0: I can't again.

473
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,243
Speaker 0: I can't prove it.

474
00:33:53,605 --> 00:34:04,386
Speaker 0: that just and the reason I say that is the one a lot of other people have said that on the Internet and - I could get the power supply to power up longer and better and work a little bit more But still not actually work.

475
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:13,663
Speaker 1: if I loaded it down with more stuff Yeah The more stuff we plugged into the power supply it would spin the fan for like a second longer and then the computer would turn On.

476
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:14,760
Speaker 0: it was kind of weird.

477
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:18,375
Speaker 1: He would have plugged in enough things He would have turned on all the way but that wouldn't have been worth.

478
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:19,060
Speaker 1: it would have been worth.

479
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:28,060
Speaker 0: So basically I ended up buying this like the crappiest power supply you can imagine Because it was the only power supply they had really at Best Buy.

480
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:31,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he had to run to the Best Buy instead of waiting to buy a nice one on Newegg.

481
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:37,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I. well I couldn't wait any longer and This crap power supply works perfectly.

482
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:37,909
Speaker 0: Yeah.

483
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,120
Speaker 0: Now the other issue is that the antac is all fancy.

484
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:43,378
Speaker 0: It has three rails of 12-volt and each.

485
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,806
Speaker 1: well I'm not gonna talk about the rails suffice to say in.

486
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:59,260
Speaker 0: it does look like while the antac power supplies are really nice They can't provide enough power over to any single 12-volt rail long enough to fully power up my system.

487
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:06,216
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm not gonna get into the thing about the rails But I learned that I'll say expensive antac power supply wouldn't work.

488
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:12,531
Speaker 0: much crappier off-brand Disgusting looking power supply in a shady box worked perfectly.

489
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:15,720
Speaker 0: I'm still talking to antac support.

490
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:24,375
Speaker 0: I kept the thing around but mainly because I really want antac to give me a better power supply to make up for this because the antac power supply is Much quieter and quieter.

491
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 0: It's silent.

492
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:29,554
Speaker 0: The part my computer is utterly silent except for the power supply.

493
00:35:29,574 --> 00:35:31,580
Speaker 1: silent mostly thanks to its antac case.

494
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,132
Speaker 0: Yes, but my case is really hot.

495
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:35,940
Speaker 0: I love this case so much.

496
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,354
Speaker 0: The only thing better was the same case where the are the panel sagging.

497
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:49,851
Speaker 0: now the panels aren't sagging yet But according to the internet within a month or two the panels, you know The cold steel rolled panels are gonna start sagging.

498
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:50,493
Speaker 0: roll, I guess.

499
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:51,035
Speaker 0: Yeah.

500
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:51,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

501
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:52,820
Speaker 0: I said cold steel rolled.

502
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,038
Speaker 0: I said the right words in the wrong order.

503
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:59,273
Speaker 0: Yep But yeah, I worked all that out.

504
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:00,640
Speaker 0: computer wouldn't brood a little bit.

505
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,854
Speaker 0: I had to fiddle with the RAM timings to get it to go.

506
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:03,538
Speaker 0: That's just because.

507
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:09,940
Speaker 0: Get this it seems like all the nice motherboards can't handle that fancy gamer.

508
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:12,307
Speaker 0: Super fast low cast latency RAM.

509
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:18,272
Speaker 0: I also learned that based on the benchmarks that super low latency Twice as much money.

510
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:22,080
Speaker 0: low voltage RAM Isn't faster at all.

511
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:28,320
Speaker 0: No benchmark demonstrated any performance benefit whatsoever to using that so-called better RAM.

512
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:46,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of a lot of stuff in computers especially, you know the overclocking gamer computer market is a lot like the audiophile market where they charge you a whole bunch of extra Money for you know something that may not actually benefit you or doesn't actually cost them extra money to make.

513
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:49,131
Speaker 1: Yeah Monster tables.

514
00:36:49,293 --> 00:37:02,414
Speaker 0: back in the day I actually did a lot of research and looked at benchmarks and spent the extra money to buy lower cast latency RAM because the performance Benchmarks did show a not well not dramatic definitely measurable performance difference.

515
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,759
Speaker 0: And also the price difference wasn't that great.

516
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:10,085
Speaker 0: Nowadays, the price difference is ludicrous and there's no performance benefit at all Huh?

517
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:11,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, fine.

518
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:15,239
Speaker 1: Also, whatever Rams gonna work the best and get as much of it as you can.

519
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:19,305
Speaker 1: now It does matter like if your computer can handle DDR 800.

520
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:21,585
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You don't want to get DDR six.

521
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:24,131
Speaker 0: the RAM speed matters crazily.

522
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,980
Speaker 0: the cast latency and the strobe latency don't matter at all.

523
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:29,640
Speaker 1: So make sure you get the right speed.

524
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:41,106
Speaker 1: So if your computer gets DDR 800 get DDR 800 but just get as much as you can and don't worry about anything else except the speed and type of the RAM and The amount of it in the price.

525
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:47,026
Speaker 0: what took me off guard was the fact that I used to always buy RAM from a few Very very specific manufacturers.

526
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:49,934
Speaker 0: I pretty much bought Corsair or Crucial.

527
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:52,260
Speaker 0: I used to buy Viking way back in the day.

528
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:55,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, Corsair makes pretty cool RAM plus pirates.

529
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:03,008
Speaker 0: Yeah the thing is those Rams were very expensive compared to the RAM ended up buying and The RAM ended buying was like OCZ whatever.

530
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:06,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it looks all ricey and it's got this red heat spreaders on.

531
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,120
Speaker 0: It's all fancy, but it was also really cheap and you know what it works perfectly.

532
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:28,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's either gonna work or it's not gonna and pretty much the only qualms I have about buying like off-brand stuff from Newegg Is that I know that probably the vast majority of that off-brand stuff works but I am taking a risk that it won't work and thus taking a risk of suffering a pain in the ass.

533
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:42,539
Speaker 1: and I know That while there might be like a 90% chance of that off-brand stuff working There's a 99% chance of the brand name stuff working and sometimes I am willing to pay that more money just for that Peace-of-mind and that this is gonna work.

534
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:48,312
Speaker 0: Yep, and I know it's not gonna be the problem But I ended up spending a hundred bucks to get two gigabytes of DDR 800.

535
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:50,237
Speaker 0: It was G skill not OCZ.

536
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,903
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever Yeah, it doesn't matter.

537
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:52,947
Speaker 0: I'd never heard of them before.

538
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:53,911
Speaker 0: They're somewhat new.

539
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,095
Speaker 0: They definitely cater to.

540
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,023
Speaker 1: they're not that off-brand There's just like.

541
00:38:57,123 --> 00:38:58,911
Speaker 0: no they just cater to a demographic.

542
00:38:58,952 --> 00:38:59,876
Speaker 0: That is not me.

543
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:06,889
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, but the hardware aside I got it all together and Installed windows.

544
00:39:07,353 --> 00:39:12,740
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah at the video card That's probably important because that was the that was the component that I spent the most time thinking about.

545
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:22,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, because basically I want a game But I'm not willing to spend the four hundred dollars on a video card that I spent back in the day on the video card I was using up until now.

546
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,014
Speaker 1: usually buy a $300 video.

547
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:36,939
Speaker 0: Okay Well The other thing is I realized that not many games have come out since half-life 2 that I really need to play other than possibly supreme commander and I Wasn't willing to spend the money to get a computer that would play that well.

548
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:50,806
Speaker 1: yet Yep And the games that you do want to play in the future like Team Fortress 2 are basically half-life 2. so Hey, you just need to play half-life 2. and you know what my computer with a GeForce FX 5900 5900 place half-life 2.

549
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:59,092
Speaker 0: well enough what I ended up going with was the pretty much one not the topest of the line But near the top of the pack of the 7000 series.

550
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:03,808
Speaker 0: I got a 7900 GS Yep, with 256 megabytes of RAM.

551
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:06,920
Speaker 1: Well, the reason I think the logic was you don't want to buy ATI.

552
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,466
Speaker 1: Oh first, let me say something.

553
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:10,033
Speaker 1: people don't seem to realize this.

554
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,318
Speaker 0: don't buy ATI.

555
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,406
Speaker 1: Not only that, but I want it.

556
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:14,811
Speaker 1: people still don't understand.

557
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:17,420
Speaker 1: ATI makes chips to go on video cards, right?

558
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,620
Speaker 1: They also make the video cards.

559
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,620
Speaker 1: You cannot get as far as I know an ATI chip that is not on an ATI video card.

560
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:28,180
Speaker 0: I don't actually know because I've never that's the way it was.

561
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,960
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it's still that way, but I'm pretty sure it is still that way.

562
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,240
Speaker 0: I've never given ATI my business and every time I've had to use an ATI card has ended in misery.

563
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:36,384
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

564
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:40,778
Speaker 1: the only way to get ATI chips is with eight video cards manufactured by ATI.

565
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:43,228
Speaker 0: It's not that way with Nvidia.

566
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:45,519
Speaker 0: In fact, you can't just buy an Nvidia video card.

567
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:54,899
Speaker 1: no Nvidia only makes chips and they sell those chips to people who then make video cards with those chips on them.

568
00:40:54,919 --> 00:41:09,100
Speaker 0: and And Well, it used to matter back in the day because there were some people who made they took those chips and they made more solid More reliable video cards, but nowadays ignore the manufacturer of your video card.

569
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:12,860
Speaker 0: Just look at what Nvidia chip it is how much RAM it has and all that business.

570
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:16,620
Speaker 1: Oh, it does appear that that situation with ATI has changed slightly.

571
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:28,380
Speaker 1: There are some other brands of video card manufacturer that make video cards with ATI chips on them But they all appear to be far inferior to the ATI product.

572
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:31,170
Speaker 0: but I just bought some brand of video card.

573
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:37,248
Speaker 0: it didn't matter because it was a g4 7900 GS and It's stupidly fast for all the games.

574
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:47,020
Speaker 0: I'm going to play and I think my plan is I got a high-end DirectX 9 card because no games need DirectX 10 yet and I don't have Vista or anything and you're mostly gonna be using Linux.

575
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:47,859
Speaker 1: So, what do you care?

576
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:54,840
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty much gonna wait until there is a game that uses DirectX 10 that I need to be able to play well

577
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:55,962
Speaker 1: and And that

578
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:59,192
Speaker 0: will not play well enough on my current video card

579
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:02,503
Speaker 1: and that you're willing to pay for that and a copy of Vista In order to play.

580
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,129
Speaker 0: yeah, however at that time.

581
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:05,333
Speaker 0: I probably will be willing to pay.

582
00:42:05,574 --> 00:42:07,360
Speaker 1: maybe maybe it depends.

583
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,748
Speaker 1: It's got to be a damn good pretty much.

584
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:10,960
Speaker 0: I'm holding out on DirectX 10 for a while.

585
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:12,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there are.

586
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:20,900
Speaker 1: I think there's a new line of g-forces That's out very very recently like days ago or maybe possibly a few days in the future maybe even today or tomorrow.

587
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:25,040
Speaker 1: That is like the bargain end of the DirectX 10 cards.

588
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,465
Speaker 1: They're like $100 or so.

589
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:30,299
Speaker 1: So those might be worth looking into but I don't know.

590
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:32,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, and video works.

591
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:33,028
Speaker 1: ATI doesn't.

592
00:42:33,048 --> 00:42:36,699
Speaker 1: here's an example of a and video working at ATI not working for anyone out there.

593
00:42:37,462 --> 00:42:40,754
Speaker 1: No OS on a computer no operating system whatsoever, right?

594
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,400
Speaker 1: We have an ATI video card.

595
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,085
Speaker 1: It has an S video out hole.

596
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:49,102
Speaker 1: we connect that as video out with an S video cable to our television and we turn the computer On.

597
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:51,312
Speaker 1: we don't see anything on the screen at all.

598
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:52,800
Speaker 1: There's no operating system.

599
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:56,620
Speaker 1: It has nothing to do with Linux or Windows or anything, but nothing shows up on the screen.

600
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,590
Speaker 1: We can't get the video output to work in Linux either.

601
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:10,530
Speaker 1: Okay, so we replace it with an in video card All right, which we connect the S video out to the television Without Even before the operating system has a chance to go.

602
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,320
Speaker 1: the display is already on the television working properly.

603
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,987
Speaker 1: Nvidia's good ATI is not.

604
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:22,646
Speaker 1: I don't care if the ATI card at the present time happens to be a little faster For a little less money.

605
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:23,811
Speaker 1: It sucks.

606
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:30,596
Speaker 1: It's just not worth that slight Performance increase in your Windows games to suffer the hassle of everything else.

607
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:43,080
Speaker 1: ATI sucks at All right, so now rim had all the parts for his computer, yep, and he had everything together Yep, and I installed Windows and I immediately installed steam after getting all my windows updates and it worked just fine.

608
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,439
Speaker 0: And then I played Counter-Strike for like three hours.

609
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:47,246
Speaker 1: Haven't played Counter-Strike in years.

610
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:47,808
Speaker 0: And you know what?

611
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:58,059
Speaker 0: I'm not as good as I used to be but I Put in some noobs and I'm getting it back and after about an hour of icy world I got my headshot AK skills back.

612
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:05,114
Speaker 0: Oh, no s or my death from above Mac 10 attack Which I did like four times to the same guy earlier today.

613
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:06,540
Speaker 1: Someone set up us the bar.

614
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:15,040
Speaker 0: so then I go to install Ubuntu and install all these other OS's to play with them and I'm not gonna go into the details.

615
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,679
Speaker 0: We had a few problems with the audio getting everything set up and we resolved all that.

616
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:29,000
Speaker 0: It turned out that my computer would crash and well not really crash, but it would freeze Hard permanently with nothing in any of the system logs.

617
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:36,928
Speaker 0: No way to solve it sort of cutting the power and it would do this whenever I opened Firefox or Audacity.

618
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it happened pretty much all the time sort of randomly.

619
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:43,420
Speaker 1: I mean you could sometimes link it to times when you were doing things with high.

620
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:44,183
Speaker 0: I could I could.

621
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:48,840
Speaker 0: well the thing is I could very specifically recreate the freeze whenever I wanted.

622
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:54,320
Speaker 0: All I had to do is open Audacity have more than three tracks and try to play any selection from them.

623
00:44:55,181 --> 00:44:56,888
Speaker 0: Try to export away from Audacity.

624
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,056
Speaker 0: try to import more than like seven tracks.

625
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:00,060
Speaker 0: Like it would always freeze.

626
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:01,780
Speaker 0: But this wasn't an Audacity problem.

627
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,240
Speaker 1: No, no, because probably made the problem happen with a bunch of programs you never use.

628
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,888
Speaker 0: Well, I tried and I couldn't with any.

629
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:08,355
Speaker 0: I open office couldn't do it.

630
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:09,500
Speaker 0: I opened a bunch of different things.

631
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:14,900
Speaker 0: The only other thing that could do it is if I opened a bunch of tabs with flash in Firefox.

632
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:18,230
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and those are the only two things but nothing else would do it.

633
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:21,180
Speaker 0: All right, uh, I tried a bunch of different OS's.

634
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,599
Speaker 0: I thought maybe I had some kernel support problems.

635
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,750
Speaker 0: So I tried to get a newer Debian.

636
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,860
Speaker 0: the stable Debian won't install.

637
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,365
Speaker 0: Well, it has an old ass old kernel.

638
00:45:29,747 --> 00:45:33,440
Speaker 0: the testing Debian won't install because it has a bug that doesn't work with my hardware.

639
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:33,741
Speaker 0: Well,

640
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:54,119
Speaker 1: yes, basically the situation was is that the newest version of the Linux kernel probably would have worked great but it the only way to get that newer version of the kernel was to use Gentoo and some horribly pain because There aren't any Linux distributions that come with the very newest kernel.

641
00:45:54,601 --> 00:46:03,140
Speaker 1: so the only way to get it is to use a distribution like Gentoo which where you build everything from source and you would Get the newest kernel or to build the kernel by hand.

642
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:06,573
Speaker 1: Basically, if you wanted that new kernel that made the computer work, right?

643
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:07,858
Speaker 1: It would have been a pain in the ass.

644
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:20,650
Speaker 1: Meanwhile all the Linux distributions out there that aren't a pain in the ass Didn't have the newest kernel and while some of them might have booted and been stable They didn't support all of the hardware in the fancy new computer.

645
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:21,632
Speaker 1: So old kernel.

646
00:46:21,693 --> 00:46:25,385
Speaker 0: I basically tried all those flavors of Linux I'd never tried before.

647
00:46:25,445 --> 00:46:28,339
Speaker 0: I have a pile of installation and live CDs laying next to me.

648
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:30,089
Speaker 0: I was fiddling left and right.

649
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,899
Speaker 0: the crashes were happening in most of them.

650
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:35,915
Speaker 0: I was breaking down and I was gonna just fucking install Gentoo.

651
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:42,260
Speaker 0: as much as I hate Gentoo I use Gentoo for the longest time and while I respect it, it's not worth the problems that had causes.

652
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:48,329
Speaker 1: Yep, I discovered in the meantime a new Linux distribution We have yet to try on this computer called Sabayon.

653
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,915
Speaker 1: S-A-B-A-Y-O-N.

654
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:51,460
Speaker 0: Well, we shouldn't really talk about it.

655
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,225
Speaker 0: We'll do a show on it.

656
00:46:52,326 --> 00:47:05,740
Speaker 1: I just want to say that it's basically It's a live CD or a live DVD that you basically push a few buttons and it installs Gentoo without the hassle and once it's installed, it's basically Gentoo without the effort.

657
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:10,000
Speaker 1: Of course You need the effort once it's installed that Gentoo requires but not the installation effort.

658
00:47:10,442 --> 00:47:16,166
Speaker 1: The problem with it that I found so far is that it installs so much Software and most of it you don't want.

659
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:21,239
Speaker 1: and one of the beautiful things about Gentoo is that you only have to have the software You want and no other software.

660
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:29,529
Speaker 0: but beside that I was running out of things to do and I decided that the last ditch is to Force myself to upgrade the BIOS because that might.

661
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:35,331
Speaker 0: there might be a bug where Linux couldn't deal with it properly But Windows could because Windows is tolerant or whatever.

662
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:37,700
Speaker 0: and if I update the BIOS everything will be fine.

663
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:51,700
Speaker 0: And let me tell you Updating an a bit BIOS is not the pleasure It used to be because the utility that used to be on the a bit website that would let you just from Windows update your BIOS They stopped supporting and got rid of because they didn't trust it anymore or something.

664
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:55,640
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell the deal is back in the day when everyone had a floppy drive, right?

665
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,260
Speaker 1: It was easy to update your BIOS because everyone had a floppy drive.

666
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,160
Speaker 1: You just make a BIOS boot floppy you put it in you turn the computer on your BIOS is updated done.

667
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:10,280
Speaker 1: Now people don't have floppy drives anymore and a bit saw this problem coming and they made a program that you run in Windows.

668
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,565
Speaker 1: It's an exe program.

669
00:48:11,585 --> 00:48:12,168
Speaker 1: You would run it.

670
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,654
Speaker 1: It would update your BIOS.

671
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,100
Speaker 1: Then you'd restart your computer.

672
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:17,354
Speaker 1: It worked on my computer that I have now.

673
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,260
Speaker 1: I've used it many times.

674
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,820
Speaker 1: There was wasn't a problem with it at least on my a bit and f7s on rims new computer.

675
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:25,940
Speaker 1: We went to the a bit website looked up his motherboard.

676
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:33,082
Speaker 1: The only way to update the BIOS on this new motherboard was with a floppy disk and we could tell that he didn't have the newest Version.

677
00:48:33,102 --> 00:48:42,480
Speaker 0: so we needed to update it and it was very difficult to do So yep And I still haven't done it yet due to the fact that I have three floppy drives sitting to the right of me.

678
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:44,858
Speaker 0: Two of them function one of them does not.

679
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:54,120
Speaker 0: independent of that it took a while to get my motherboard to Recognize a floppy and deal with it and then that's because you didn't choose the right BIOS options to turn.

680
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,860
Speaker 0: No, because even when I did that then I plug the cable in upside down because floppies don't have the nice tab.

681
00:48:59,843 --> 00:49:02,560
Speaker 1: Your fault and not the fault of the computer not working with floppy drive.

682
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,509
Speaker 0: Well, also there were three different areas.

683
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:06,700
Speaker 0: I do enable all three to make the floppy drive work.

684
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:07,990
Speaker 1: Well, you disabled them all.

685
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,300
Speaker 1: they weren't enabled by default.

686
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:11,148
Speaker 1: You just turn them off and then you had to turn them.

687
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:20,880
Speaker 0: actually know some of they were disabled by default Because the floppy and the parallel ATA and all that stuff like the PCI are this legacy crap.

688
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,431
Speaker 0: That's on the motherboard in case you need it.

689
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,419
Speaker 0: They don't expect you to use it.

690
00:49:23,701 --> 00:49:26,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so I finally get that resolved.

691
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:28,370
Speaker 0: that didn't take long It's just I had to plug it all in.

692
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:32,094
Speaker 0: Uh We don't have a single functioning floppy disk.

693
00:49:32,496 --> 00:49:33,220
Speaker 0: None of them worked.

694
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:34,948
Speaker 1: Well, I think I found one that might work.

695
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I haven't tried a few and they didn't work.

696
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,407
Speaker 0: Yeah One of them seemed like it was working.

697
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,054
Speaker 0: then tried to boot it and it wouldn't work.

698
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:44,200
Speaker 0: and I'm trying to figure out man Is the floppy still not working then?

699
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,420
Speaker 0: I just discovered that it didn't actually write the data to the floppy.

700
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,206
Speaker 0: It just said it did.

701
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:49,516
Speaker 0: the floppy didn't even spin.

702
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:50,120
Speaker 0: as far as I can.

703
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got a lot of floppy disks that we haven't used in years and I'm not sure how many of them are good.

704
00:49:55,103 --> 00:49:57,815
Speaker 0: The one floppy that was good because it happened to be laying out.

705
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:59,000
Speaker 0: I rearranged all my games.

706
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:06,393
Speaker 0: I have this nine of the installation for quest for glory for That disk worked fine, but there's no way in hell.

707
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:07,539
Speaker 0: I was gonna use that disk.

708
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:09,387
Speaker 1: Well, you could just copy the data off of it.

709
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:10,632
Speaker 0: I didn't want to.

710
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:13,905
Speaker 0: I don't want to risk that disk In any capacity.

711
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:14,868
Speaker 1: don't risk that did.

712
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:15,751
Speaker 0: don't risk that disk.

713
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:16,012
Speaker 1: Yeah.

714
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:18,620
Speaker 1: Anyway, you lost my stack of CD ours.

715
00:50:19,043 --> 00:50:20,798
Speaker 0: I don't know where that stack CD ours.

716
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:25,293
Speaker 1: way I think I'm gonna go buy like a tiny package of floppy disks and some CD ours.

717
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:25,935
Speaker 0: Yeah.

718
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:38,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway I just want to point out that for some reason that there was no technical reason that we could not make a boot CD Rom and then do the BIOS from that.

719
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:41,480
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I would had to make a custom CD run that had the bios on it.

720
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,469
Speaker 1: Yes, it seems like they're like in Windows.

721
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:49,465
Speaker 1: if you want to make a bootable DOS floppy disk There's just a button that does that in Windows Linux nothing.

722
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:56,902
Speaker 1: there's no button that I can see to make a bootable DOS bootable DOS keep mind you not just bootable CD rock.

723
00:50:56,942 --> 00:51:02,240
Speaker 0: well there is but the thing is what I would have had to do is create such a thing on my computer.

724
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:08,309
Speaker 0: There's various means to do it that are not trivial and while I could have done them It wasn't worth the effort as opposed to just

725
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,401
Speaker 1: me to like install Nero and then do a bunch of crap and

726
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:17,220
Speaker 0: or I could have like gotten free DOS put it on a CD and made it a bootable CD and put all the

727
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,672
Speaker 1: Files on it, but that's not as trustworthy as using the windows.

728
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:29,682
Speaker 0: However floppy in my last-ditch effort I tried doing the thing that as in the past almost always made a screwed up Linux machine where you couldn't get anything else Go and work.

729
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:34,800
Speaker 0: I turned off a CPI and a pic and now my computer is working perfectly.

730
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:39,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember there are some problems in the past with a pic and instability in the kernel.

731
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:46,940
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm getting the feeling now that if the problems are still existing or if they come back up from the dead.

732
00:51:47,142 --> 00:51:52,040
Speaker 1: Everytime new motherboards come out They should really just rewrite that whole module in the kernel.

733
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,178
Speaker 0: It is definitely a problem with Linux because I want to do point out that Windows works like a champ.

734
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:02,041
Speaker 1: Yep I think it's probably something that would work in 2621.

735
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:11,633
Speaker 1: The problem is Ubuntu which is the only easy to use in good distribution for us is 2620. so we and it's very difficult for us to get the newer kernel.

736
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:14,829
Speaker 0: You know, it's not that it's difficult It's that it's not worth the effort.

737
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:18,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's basically what I'm saying Except I was more difficult or more.

738
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:21,880
Speaker 0: I was willing to put far more effort into solving the solution by another means.

739
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:30,020
Speaker 1: yes, and a CPI is the thing that Controls like when your computer goes to sleep and hibernates and and that's always been a problem in Linux.

740
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Linux is doing a lot better job of that.

741
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:40,260
Speaker 1: But it's basically that stuff is really undocumented and it's different with every single computer and no one follows the rules.

742
00:52:40,802 --> 00:52:44,577
Speaker 1: So, you know with some computers it just works perfectly and other computers.

743
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:45,480
Speaker 1: It doesn't work at all.

744
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:58,438
Speaker 1: So it depends, you know some people like on my laptop It kind of works but sometimes a little buggy, but it won't screw me, but I guess I'm rims Motherboard it just it's so incompatible that it crashes.

745
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:02,600
Speaker 0: now What I did is I just disabled them all in one fell swoop and the computer works.

746
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:09,563
Speaker 0: I might whenever I feel like it try using each one at a time to figure out if it's both of them or if it's just One of them.

747
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:14,827
Speaker 1: seemed like a pig to me because that's very similar to the problem I had with my parents computer in the past and a pic.

748
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:23,534
Speaker 1: basically there was this crazy problem right where if you had a Ubuntu I think the one before dapper or maybe dapper.

749
00:53:23,554 --> 00:53:24,075
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

750
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:42,171
Speaker 1: I think the one before dapper and you had an motherboard with an Nvidia integrated graphics processor an onboard Nvidia card that you were using and you had didn't have your RAM and dual in dual channel mode and You had the IO a pic on.

751
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,840
Speaker 0: I remember when Scott described this to me.

752
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,144
Speaker 0: Oh, I I couldn't.

753
00:53:45,165 --> 00:53:49,460
Speaker 0: I couldn't believe that he had the patience to solve it because I would have just said you know what?

754
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,486
Speaker 0: It doesn't work and gone home because it.

755
00:53:51,526 --> 00:53:55,100
Speaker 0: why wouldn't I don't like trouble if you had all those things in combination?

756
00:53:55,961 --> 00:53:59,820
Speaker 1: Then the computer would sort of freeze randomly similar to the way it was freezing for rim.

757
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,896
Speaker 1: if you bought a new video card and use that instead of the integrated graphics processor problem went away.

758
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:08,689
Speaker 1: if you got another stick of Ram and dual channel mode turn on problem went away.

759
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,977
Speaker 1: if you turn the IO a pic off problem went away.

760
00:54:11,057 --> 00:54:12,937
Speaker 1: use a newer version Of Ubuntu problem went away.

761
00:54:13,602 --> 00:54:17,035
Speaker 1: So that shows you the see people are gonna use.

762
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:21,612
Speaker 1: probably what we've said now to say Oh Linux blah and well yet kinda Linux blah.

763
00:54:21,752 --> 00:54:22,535
Speaker 1: new hardware.

764
00:54:22,877 --> 00:54:23,499
Speaker 1: the thing is.

765
00:54:24,243 --> 00:54:25,190
Speaker 1: Think about that problem.

766
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,348
Speaker 1: that is such an obscure problem And it only happens on the newest of awesomest hardware.

767
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:34,067
Speaker 1: unless your hardware is like the bleeding edge craziness Linux is gonna work.

768
00:54:34,127 --> 00:54:35,436
Speaker 1: fine is not a problem for you.

769
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:39,371
Speaker 0: plus I do note that the problem is solved and I can use the computer now.

770
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:45,050
Speaker 0: and the thing is I'm so fickle I Was ready to just dump two windows in a second.

771
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,653
Speaker 0: I'd be like screw it.

772
00:54:45,713 --> 00:55:00,019
Speaker 0: I'll just use windows, but The only reason I didn't do that and I kept trying to make Linux work was that the one program that I really need Resound does not exist anywhere else, and I could have built it in Sigmund or done a VMware.

773
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,922
Speaker 0: You know what.

774
00:55:01,103 --> 00:55:02,969
Speaker 0: I can't get it to build in Linux.

775
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can but only unlike Gentoo's.

776
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:07,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, only on Gentoo.

777
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:09,149
Speaker 0: I'll try it on Ubuntu.

778
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:12,340
Speaker 1: No no no that's something that people need to understand.

779
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:13,777
Speaker 1: Is that if you want to build?

780
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:26,688
Speaker 1: Like Linux software from source code like by hand it'll most of the time work on most distributions But only gen 2 and distributions like it seem to have the pure GCC.

781
00:55:26,749 --> 00:55:27,092
Speaker 1: that will.

782
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:28,846
Speaker 1: all that will work 99% of the time.

783
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:36,260
Speaker 1: like Ubuntu will only successfully build software like 90% of the time because it's not pure.

784
00:55:36,763 --> 00:55:43,929
Speaker 0: but I realize I don't want to talk about this very long, but Resound is Pretty much the perfect podcasting solution.

785
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:47,160
Speaker 1: for as far as what choices are currently available?

786
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,190
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean you could make something more perfect.

787
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:49,431
Speaker 0: Well.

788
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:51,340
Speaker 0: Yes, you could but it doesn't presently exist.

789
00:55:51,761 --> 00:56:00,320
Speaker 0: I looked around and I tried a whole bunch of audio applications and on my windows I pirated a whole bunch of things just to try them all out.

790
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:01,707
Speaker 0: Just to try them out.

791
00:56:01,748 --> 00:56:03,256
Speaker 0: I was actually willing to purchase them.

792
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:14,696
Speaker 0: however I discovered that almost every audio program out there when it comes to single track wave editing now Multitrack those programs are all really nice, and they're a lot better than audacity.

793
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:26,879
Speaker 0: I tell you what and But what they don't have is they lack certain critical Functionality that I really need to do geek nights or to do the other things I do with audio And I wonder why they're not there.

794
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:30,913
Speaker 1: It's like are we the only people in the entire world who use these functions?

795
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:36,280
Speaker 0: that can't possibly be true and a lot of them Will have the functions, but not to the level of control that I want.

796
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:44,689
Speaker 0: I mean I want to control the raw math of whatever I'm doing and while there are ways to do that with Nyquist things and Plugins it's already all there in Resound.

797
00:56:44,990 --> 00:57:02,367
Speaker 0: and also while the interface of Resound is really old-looking The way you interface with the audio is something that I haven't seen in any other program and maybe it's just that people don't have to edit the volume of audio this quickly like I do but I Haven't found anything better.

798
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,940
Speaker 0: It's not a matter of oh, I'm not used to it.

799
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,340
Speaker 0: It's a matter of it takes fewer clicks to do the things I need to do in Resound than in any other program.

800
00:57:10,581 --> 00:57:13,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like other programs can do what we do.

801
00:57:13,812 --> 00:57:22,920
Speaker 1: however even if you're the Grandmaster It will take you like an hour more to do it with that other program simply by the sheer number of clicks and processing time.

802
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:29,804
Speaker 0: Also, and here's the funny bit I'll end it on this because because Audacity crashed and now you know whatever Resound didn't crash.

803
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:34,040
Speaker 0: it crashed on its own, but that's just because it's Resound and I we resolved that with Jack.

804
00:57:34,602 --> 00:57:39,139
Speaker 0: But I had Resound and that was the only program I could use to make the show.

805
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:43,483
Speaker 0: So I had to make the whole show in a single track editor Which totally sucks.

806
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:49,560
Speaker 0: as a result I had to get creative and I learned that I and I made it and I'm still tweaking it.

807
00:57:49,620 --> 00:58:00,760
Speaker 0: But I was able to make a script in Resound that will make Process and do the entire show from start to finish and create an mp3 when it's done.

808
00:58:01,362 --> 00:58:06,599
Speaker 1: Wow, so basically all you do is you edit out the coughs and the stuff I spend because you can't have a computer.

809
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:07,823
Speaker 1: do that It computer in this.

810
00:58:07,883 --> 00:58:12,120
Speaker 0: as an AI I could but it would be very difficult and prone to error.

811
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,579
Speaker 1: It would be much easier to just do it by hand every night.

812
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:18,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you just do that and that takes how many minutes just to cut the things out?

813
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,365
Speaker 1: You know click click push a button click.

814
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:25,040
Speaker 0: it takes about one second for ten minutes of audio at this point to do that.

815
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you push a single button and the show is produced.

816
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:35,405
Speaker 1: No other audio application is capable of this even the incredibly expensive $1,000 professional ones.

817
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:39,760
Speaker 1: they can do it, but there's so much less efficient in the user interface.

818
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:46,148
Speaker 1: Meanwhile this free open source one that's kind of got this junky interface That's ugly and blah.

819
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,196
Speaker 1: it does it in one button.

820
00:58:48,477 --> 00:58:52,520
Speaker 0: part of the problem It's just that those expensive programs do what they do very well.

821
00:58:52,881 --> 00:59:04,190
Speaker 1: And if you were using them for the purposes for which they are intended like making music in a music studio Or you work in a radio studio, or there's a live concert And you they're great work in the sound.

822
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:10,355
Speaker 0: when I took digital audio at our IT And we use Pro Tools Pro Tools was the motherfucking bomb when it came to do.

823
00:59:10,616 --> 00:59:11,218
Speaker 0: it was great.

824
00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:11,620
Speaker 0: I loved it.

825
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:15,617
Speaker 0: We recorded everything multi-track in the studio, and I could just move stuff around.

826
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:16,160
Speaker 0: it was great.

827
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:27,877
Speaker 0: And while it was slow and somewhat inefficient to edit things compared to resound Well or even audacity in some cases I didn't need to do it quickly because you're not editing like but it but it but it but a bit.

828
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,869
Speaker 0: when you're making music You're editing it slowly.

829
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:31,200
Speaker 0: you're checking to make sure things work.

830
00:59:31,463 --> 00:59:41,600
Speaker 0: You're doing things very precisely And it's just none of those things are efficient for the fast and loose Edit an hour of audio and throw it up on the air ten minutes later thing that we do.

831
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:58,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if we made a podcast once a week or once a month or less often than four days a week right then We could probably go out and get one of those digital mixers And it would record both of us on two separate tracks And we could edit ourselves individually and mix it together, and it would be this you know double awesome professional job.

832
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:02,563
Speaker 1: But when you do it at four days a week You don't have time for that.

833
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:26,150
Speaker 1: you need something more efficient, and I really think that if someone made an audio application that incorporated the powerful Multitrack features of say Pro Tools or audition with the single fat the single track post-production editing efficiency of resound that you could make Amazing audio and even less time that has ever been done before.

834
01:00:28,123 --> 01:00:34,655
Speaker 0: And on that note I think we're done because I smell tofu downstairs And I want to turn my AC back on now that my room doesn't smell like burning.

835
01:00:34,775 --> 01:00:37,891
Speaker 1: and also I'm one day I'm gonna make a podcasting application.

836
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:38,696
Speaker 1: that is perfect.

837
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:44,918
Speaker 0: basically We just need to take the interface and the power of resound and write a program that does that.

838
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:45,119
Speaker 1: well.

839
01:00:45,139 --> 01:00:49,596
Speaker 1: basically I just replace I take the code of resound that does the audio part and replace the rest.

840
01:00:49,777 --> 01:00:50,460
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much.

841
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:54,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we could add it all to that Joe kosher which has promise, but it's currently useless.

842
01:00:54,774 --> 01:00:56,440
