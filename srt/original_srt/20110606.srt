Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:28,516
Speaker 1: And of course my goddamn bike got stolen.

8
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:29,398

10
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,646
Speaker 1: Oh my god It's the most bike steel in his city.

11
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:40,979
Speaker 1: Even the cops are like, yeah, there's like this professional ring of like me.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,389
Speaker 0: now Understand that right?

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,840
Speaker 0: I mean if you're a professional thief Bicycles think about how easy it is.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,040
Speaker 1: I mean you've seen those performance guys who basically go in very openly and sometimes right.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,488
Speaker 0: But you see there isn't that much money in by other.

16
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,780
Speaker 0: is how much money could I steal a relatively new?

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,880
Speaker 1: Nice, like not a fancy like super racing bike like a nice bike that costs like five hundred thousand dollars You can easily sell five hundred thousand five hundred to a thousand dollars.

18
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:11,999
Speaker 1: You can easily sell that for a few hundred bucks and it basically cost you nothing.

19
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:17,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are many other things you could steal that is much better off than what.

20
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,550
Speaker 1: that's that Most things like that are higher risk and are more difficult defense.

21
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:26,208
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not ready card numbers Yeah, and you know what people steal those all the time.

22
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:29,880
Speaker 1: I'm just probably competition in the credit card thievery market.

23
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,557
Speaker 0: I'm just saying they're also kind much more lucrative.

24
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:39,380
Speaker 1: And if you don't if you're not already, you know in the good with Russian hackers, you know, you're some street punk.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,002
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do?

26
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:42,229
Speaker 1: dealing drugs is likely to get you arrested.

27
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:45,359
Speaker 1: There's no way anyone will ever arrest you stealing a bike jewelry.

28
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,890
Speaker 1: Who are you gonna steal jewelry from?

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,760
Speaker 1: and more importantly who the fuck?

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,945
Speaker 1: Are you gonna sell jewelry to?

31
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,773
Speaker 1: jewelry has almost no resale value.

32
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:54,280
Speaker 0: sell it to all those guys.

33
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,240
Speaker 0: You know you ever walk down like the jewelry street and they're always like we buy gold.

34
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:57,983
Speaker 0: You know who's?

35
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:02,037
Speaker 0: you think who the hell would walk down that street to sell gold jewelry thief.

36
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:02,680
Speaker 0: That's right.

37
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:06,092
Speaker 0: The jewelry thieves are much better off than the bike.

38
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:07,840
Speaker 1: There's not that much jewelry to steal.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,495
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like people leave their jewelry tied up to posts on the street.

40
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:15,307
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised What I really.

41
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:24,237
Speaker 1: yeah, what amazes me though is that you know, I Was careful with my bike like I knew that the city is just a fucking like den of thieves.

42
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:24,959
Speaker 1: I knew this.

43
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:34,433
Speaker 1: So I never rode my nice bike Unless it was gonna like I would never leave it out of my sight for any like length of time Like if I knew I'd be in a store for more than like 15 minutes.

44
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:35,659
Speaker 1: I wouldn't use my nice bike.

45
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:38,774
Speaker 1: I was in the Home Depot less than 10 minutes.

46
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,613
Speaker 0: That's too long Yeah, and they stole it.

47
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:45,575
Speaker 1: in that time There were cops who visible like 50 feet away who didn't notice anything.

48
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:47,160
Speaker 1: huge crowds broad daylight.

49
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:50,340
Speaker 0: Well, of course, they couldn't notice because it was in the middle of a huge crowd.

50
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:54,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it was quiet and there were cops 50 feet away They would have seen it because they've been the only person to look at.

51
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:58,732
Speaker 1: Yep, but what was very funny is that Emily's bike was chained to my bike.

52
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:00,077
Speaker 1: They didn't steal hers.

53
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:01,100
Speaker 0: No, this is a piece of crap.

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,327
Speaker 0: I Did I did.

55
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,200
Speaker 0: how'd you get home subway?

56
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah subway.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,040
Speaker 1: Well since we went to the Home Depot and they chose they wanted like 25 bucks to deliver the one thing we wanted to buy.

58
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:13,266
Speaker 1: So we were like fuck it.

59
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:14,391
Speaker 1: We'll just go get it later.

60
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,100
Speaker 1: And then my bike was stolen.

61
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:22,199
Speaker 1: So since I didn't have my bike Emily just biked home and I went back into the Home Depot and bought the thing and carried it home on the subway.

62
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:28,555
Speaker 1: The cashier was even like, ah, you really needed this pegboard didn't you?

63
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,067
Speaker 1: and I was like now my bike got stolen And she's like.

Speaker 1: I'm like, yeah, I might as well.

66
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually mad props to Home Depot.

67
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:42,779
Speaker 0: I saw a video recently Oh, yeah of it was like some crazy right-wing nut job and he was like.

68
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,820
Speaker 0: I called up the Home Depot cuz they were donating to gay.

69
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:54,124
Speaker 1: No usually when something like this happens the story is always and the company quietly backed down and made some noncommittal statement and he was Like and he's like.

70
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:57,320
Speaker 0: they said they support diversity and we got you know.

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,104
Speaker 0: So I got.

72
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:00,699
Speaker 0: we got boycott Home Depot cuz they're going to hell.

73
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:05,033
Speaker 0: It was something along those lines and I was like, yeah Home Depot.

74
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:05,475
Speaker 0: That's right.

75
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,060
Speaker 1: Yeah Home Depot basically said, you know what?

76
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,513
Speaker 1: We're totally okay with gay people and we don't really need your business that much.

77
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:12,135
Speaker 1: So go nuts.

78
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:19,548
Speaker 0: Yeah I think Home Depot is gonna be alright because it's actually Hardware is one of the few things that you know is.

79
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,980
Speaker 0: you know online isn't always gonna be able to beat it out.

80
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:34,110
Speaker 0: I mean, I buy hardware is online from you know, like You know screwdriver, you know a level small amounts of wood I'm not gonna buy online because wood is very non-uniform.

81
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,733
Speaker 1: if I'm buying like three pieces of wood for a small project I want to see the pieces of wood and buy them.

82
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:39,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not just wood.

83
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,218
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's all kinds of stuff that out.

84
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:46,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff that like especially if you're doing a hardware project, right?

85
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,151
Speaker 0: Like you're remodeling your house or you're building something.

86
00:04:49,171 --> 00:05:00,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you might be like, oh shit I need X and you need X like now Really specific and it's like you can't be waiting three days and you always have the instinct.

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,560
Speaker 1: You're like, I wonder if I could use these other three tools to make something that would almost do that thing.

88
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:13,216
Speaker 0: Oh, this is a situation Like you need to replace a screw because you stripped it and now you go and you're like you go online and you're like, okay I don't need it right away.

89
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:18,060
Speaker 0: Let's see I need a. this inches screw and the thing of screws shows up and they're slightly off.

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,524
Speaker 0: You're like fuck.

91
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,500
Speaker 1: you're like, ah, you're trying to get the pic one time.

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,580
Speaker 1: I remember one time I was looking at pictures of screws on Amazon.

93
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, good job and trying to figure out if the threading was the same as the scrubs like holding up to the monitor.

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,432
Speaker 0: It's like no you just got to go to the hardware store and put the screw.

95
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,338
Speaker 0: hold the screw up next to the example screw And look at I hate going to hardware stores though.

96
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,122
Speaker 0: Why?

97
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:43,827
Speaker 1: because every time I'm in a hardware store the geek comes out and wants just random stuff I think like Oh electronics.

98
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:49,008
Speaker 1: I wonder if I could ooh HDMI cables ooh HDMI ports to put in my wall.

99
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:59,535
Speaker 1: Maybe I should replace all my cat six with cat seven And then I end up in like the nail gun area just thinking like yeah It'd be really fun to have this for like 15 minutes.

100
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:04,380
Speaker 1: Sure would Was that xkcd where the guy buys a house?

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,830
Speaker 1: He's like, oh I can do whatever I want.

102
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,805
Speaker 1: if I want to drill a hole through this wall I can just do it.

103
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,372
Speaker 1: and then he drilled his house down.

104
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:10,854
Speaker 1: Yep.

105
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:11,216
Speaker 0: Yeah.

106
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:11,578
Speaker 0: Yeah.

107
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:15,895
Speaker 1: So I also ran a race right before my bike got stolen.

108
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,763
Speaker 1: the first time in almost a decade Uh-huh.

109
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,109
Speaker 0: I ran in a win.

110
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,435
Speaker 1: No, of course not.

111
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:20,877
Speaker 1: Are you kidding?

112
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:33,133
Speaker 1: It's New York the most poodle grace you could have like five-year-old kid charity run for autistic Alzheimer's and Some marathon runner will show up and win it.

113
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,579
Speaker 0: So a place did you come in?

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,257
Speaker 1: I came in 80th out of like 1,300 people Which is not too bad and in my age class gender and age 20 to 29 year old.

115
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,686
Speaker 1: So I'm at the top of that age class.

116
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:44,890
Speaker 1: I came in like 20th.

117
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,837
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and I came in like 60th.

118
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,007
Speaker 0: They can really track all this data.

119
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:49,731
Speaker 0: This is pretty interesting.

120
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:50,053
Speaker 1: get this.

121
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,018
Speaker 1: So here's how they do it.

122
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,672
Speaker 0: Oh, no, you wear a number.

123
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:58,580
Speaker 0: they write your information So they put your time and your number and then the computer figures are actually really nice.

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,364
Speaker 1: You wear the number.

125
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,240
Speaker 1: number is basically just for photo verification after the fact.

126
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:11,640
Speaker 1: But really they give you this big RFID thing that you put on your shoe And it tracks when you cross the start line and cross the finish line And wait a minute.

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
Speaker 0: So why don't I wave it at the start line get on a motorcycle and wave it at the finish line?

128
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,562
Speaker 1: They'd notice.

129
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,505
Speaker 0: I could.

130
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:20,114
Speaker 0: just I could get off the motorcycle like a mile before the end.

131
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:20,997
Speaker 1: It's only a 5k run.

132
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,351
Speaker 1: It was like three and a something miles, right?

133
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,140
Speaker 0: So that go to the two miles on the bike.

134
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:27,665
Speaker 1: It was in Central Park.

135
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:29,231
Speaker 1: There's you wouldn't know it worked.

136
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,560
Speaker 0: Oh, it was just completely in Central Park.

137
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, I probably could done that.

138
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,793
Speaker 0: I probably wouldn't have been an 80th place.

139
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,880
Speaker 0: I would have been more like 100 plays proud of myself.

140
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:48,760
Speaker 1: But I also realized I'm old because the proud part came that I started the front like I started with the people who were trying To win which I'd never done in a race before because usually people are stupid and they all disappear.

141
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:56,883
Speaker 1: Well, remember that Chase corporate challenge we did that was the last race I ran and remember how we all stood at like the six-minute mile mark is we're like, yeah six seven minutes We can do this.

142
00:07:57,486 --> 00:08:05,180
Speaker 1: and then everyone near us was actually in the 15-minute miles And they just were stupid and stood in the wrong place and it took like 10 minutes for us to even get going.

143
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:11,817
Speaker 1: But I started in the very front and I ran with the lead pack all the way past the first mile.

144
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,140
Speaker 1: and then The fact that I didn't eat breakfast.

145
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:23,419
Speaker 1: I was late to the race so I biked over there really hard parked and ran right away and I chugged a Red Bull right before Caught up with me and that right the Red Bull was supposed to help you.

146
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Red Bull helped me.

147
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:25,180
Speaker 0: There's only three.

148
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,306
Speaker 0: It was only three K's.

149
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:27,672
Speaker 0: the Red Bull should have helped you the whole way.

150
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:31,592
Speaker 1: the Red Bull helped me in the first mile The stomach not so happy in the second mile.

151
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,039
Speaker 0: You should have brought two more Red Bulls.

152
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,428
Speaker 1: I should have just vomited and then kept running.

153
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,275
Speaker 0: but now you could have pooped and kept running too.

154
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,861
Speaker 1: that pooping wouldn't really had done It.

155
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:39,919
Speaker 1: it wasn't at the poop stage.

156
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:49,402
Speaker 1: But so almost a decade ago I ran a three and a half mile race and I end by time ended up being like 22 minutes almost exactly This time.

157
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,578
Speaker 1: a decade later ran the same race after having trained and run rigorously for a decade.

158
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,083
Speaker 1: Yeah 22 minutes.

159
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:57,445
Speaker 0: Yep.

160
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:02,864
Speaker 0: So, you know the winners time was probably like 12 minutes 17 Really for three.

161
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:03,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

162
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:07,760
Speaker 1: Hmm three back-to-back five six minute miles is actually pretty tough to do.

163
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

164
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:09,611
Speaker 0: but usually it's like the.

165
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,200
Speaker 0: you know, the people who are like the best in the world.

166
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,565
Speaker 0: They're on four minute miles, right?

167
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,559
Speaker 1: So if they're you know, yeah a minute mile one mile run three of those.

168
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:19,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are people who run multiple four minute miles.

169
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:28,371
Speaker 1: Yeah Those people don't show up to every race anyway, but I realize I peaked Probably somewhere in between there and I'm basically by working so hard.

170
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:34,568
Speaker 1: I am maintaining the fitness level I had when I was 20 Mmm, which is both optimistic and pessimistic.

171
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:44,380
Speaker 1: but optimism reigns because at the three mile mark when there's like a half mile to go The oldest dude you can imagine just flew right fucking by me.

172
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy was like 70.

173
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:49,977
Speaker 0: I've seen I think I've seen that guy had an old man run like.

174
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,040
Speaker 1: he was kind of shuffling But he was shuffling faster than I was running.

175
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:03,499
Speaker 0: I might I it either might be the same guy I see or a similar guy because when I bike sometimes in the morning down Second Avenue or whatever Avenue it is to go south.

176
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:09,538
Speaker 0: There's sometimes an old guy running north who's way old but he's fucking running and I'm like damn.

177
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:10,100
Speaker 0: look at that guy.

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:21,983
Speaker 1: I've seen him like three or four times when I bike to work There's always one super homeless guy with a giant Shopping cart full of homeless guy stuff and he must have a commute because he's always coming up the Queensboro Bridge at the exact same Time every morning.

179
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:22,444
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:25,434
Speaker 1: I guess he commutes to Queens to do whatever hobos do.

181
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:27,924
Speaker 0: there's a lot of people I see daily Just like you.

182
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:30,822
Speaker 0: just see them doing the same path on the street like the.

183
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:40,180
Speaker 0: this is one guy who comes over the Queensboro Bridge in the mornings and Basically, he's I don't know He's some sort of worker in a building of some sort cuz he's wearing like almost everyone.

184
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:46,350
Speaker 0: He's wearing that some sort of you know building, you know, you know, no works for the building like, you know Superintendent uniform kind of thing.

185
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,296
Speaker 0: I heard you gots.

186
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:52,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Basically, this guy has the hunches hunched like his.

187
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,440
Speaker 0: he doesn't have a hunch like his back, you know has a big blob on it.

188
00:10:55,761 --> 00:11:01,120
Speaker 0: He has a hunch like he's like literally bent over and he's like flimsy like a Twizzler.

189
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,234
Speaker 0: It's like if you're holding a Twizzler and you let it droop over.

190
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:04,140
Speaker 0: that's what this guy looks like.

191
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,575
Speaker 1: Well now you got something to work toward.

192
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,781
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't think you can possibly end up that bad.

193
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:14,930
Speaker 1: So it's Monday and You know, there's a lot of tech news, but we probably have to talk about jobs.

194
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:15,873
Speaker 1: Yep.

195
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:21,480
Speaker 0: It's Apple day today, which Seems to always occur a lot on Mondays.

196
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:27,499
Speaker 0: Guess it's just you know, I guess coincidence that we do our tech show on Monday and Apple does Mondays also.

197
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, well clearly Apple is emulating us.

198
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:37,721
Speaker 0: But anyway So we report on them in a timely manner if you just want all the information you can go to engage it and read it All.

199
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,955
Speaker 0: but I just want to hit some high notes and provide some insights that I don't think other people have right.

200
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,945
Speaker 0: Oh first major Insight OS X lion.

201
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:46,710
Speaker 0: right regardless of any features.

202
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,675
Speaker 1: It's adding the pricing is the story.

203
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,197
Speaker 0: No, no.

204
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:49,878
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

205
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:50,801
Speaker 0: No, no You're wrong.

206
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:56,940
Speaker 0: Okay, it's 30 bucks, but that's not a big deal because actually if you remember snow leopard was also similarly lowly priced.

207
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,250
Speaker 1: Well, this is 30 bucks for every Apple PC you own.

208
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:00,314
Speaker 0: That's true.

209
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:01,700
Speaker 0: That's slightly better.

210
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but are you ready for the real the real?

211
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,404
Speaker 1: What do you think is the real story here?

212
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:09,016
Speaker 0: You can only buy OS X lion in the OS X App Store.

213
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,225
Speaker 1: I Didn't even notice that.

214
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,095
Speaker 0: and why is that a big deal?

215
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,160
Speaker 0: Well, you think oh, it's not a big.

216
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:19,776
Speaker 1: well There's that lawsuit where Apple's trying to claim that the App Store is a is a mark of theirs.

217
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:23,807
Speaker 1: because Apple App Store You're missing it.

218
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,578
Speaker 0: You're saying that's one thing.

219
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:31,255
Speaker 0: now What is the biggest problem with OS X line only being available in the Mac OS X App Store?

220
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:36,340
Speaker 1: Oh It's harder to I don't know pirate.

221
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:42,397
Speaker 0: It's impossible to get it say in VirtualBox or make a hackintosh or anything because there's no DVD.

222
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:43,500
Speaker 0: There's no USB stick.

223
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,163
Speaker 0: There's no nothing.

224
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:48,391
Speaker 0: You know, the only way you can get it is if you already have a Mac that already has the Mac App Store.

225
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,305
Speaker 0: There's no other way to get it.

226
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:54,200
Speaker 0: We won't be able to install it in anything other than a Mac that already comes with it.

227
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,630
Speaker 1: So I have a hackintosh running snow leopard.

228
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:58,854
Speaker 0: Is it gonna upgrade?

229
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,097
Speaker 1: That's what I'm curious about.

230
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:00,980
Speaker 0: I'm very curious.

231
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:01,830
Speaker 1: That's the only way.

232
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,620
Speaker 0: that's the only way.

233
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:04,167
Speaker 1: That's the second only way.

234
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,060
Speaker 1: the real only way is some hackers gonna come up with a way.

235
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:13,464
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that maybe they're gonna come up with some snow leopard upgrade the lion trick But what?

236
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaker 0: one or two more versions down the road, you know, they're not going back, right?

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,110
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be total SOL.

238
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,200
Speaker 1: Well, I think there are many reasons Apple is doing this.

239
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:27,384
Speaker 1: I do agree now that your yours is probably the primary reason but It worries me.

240
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:28,367
Speaker 1: It's not just that.

241
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:29,892
Speaker 1: in general people are really.

242
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:32,280
Speaker 1: it's like the PC world is going through the same thing.

243
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,309
Speaker 1: It went through, you know, 10 20 30 years ago.

244
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:49,733
Speaker 1: the same cycles happen where suddenly they're becoming very Like this app thing is happening where people aren't down there like people are downloading apps for their androids their iPhones The same way that people used to go to CNET and download shareware.

245
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,126
Speaker 0: Yeah as opposed to installing only now They're paying.

246
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,079
Speaker 0: only now they're paying money.

247
00:13:53,641 --> 00:14:01,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you know everything in the Mac world always cost money and those things that cost money in the Mac world are free everywhere Else, right?

248
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,752
Speaker 0: It's like you owe a Mac.

249
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,800
Speaker 0: Oh you want to develop for the Mac, right?

250
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,420
Speaker 0: Well, you know you can sort of buy this Mac developer thing for $100 and you could buy Xcode for 10 bucks.

251
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,470
Speaker 0: Oh show you want to develop something for Windows here.

252
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,600
Speaker 0: Here's Microsoft Visual Studio Express for free.

253
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,712
Speaker 1: You got an emulator, but you want to use your fancy controller with it.

254
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:19,500
Speaker 1: Well, there's an app that'll do that.

255
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, you know, it's everything on Apple's platforms cost money.

256
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:24,893
Speaker 0: That's free everywhere else.

257
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,560
Speaker 0: All right, let's let's continue down this road, right?

258
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:33,231
Speaker 0: iOS 5 greatly improved integrated Twitter notification thing.

259
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:37,087
Speaker 1: which notifications Android is like?

260
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,292
Speaker 1: I really like Android.

261
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:47,060
Speaker 1: I have no complaints about my phone, but notifications Android are just so like 10 years ago.

262
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,760
Speaker 0: Are they really because they really can't be worse than they are in the iPhone now with iPhone is similarly bad.

263
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:55,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but this looks like this looks like a winner here.

264
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:58,552
Speaker 1: You know, you know what the real winner is in that front web OS.

265
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,607
Speaker 1: web OS to this day has the best Notification system I have ever seen.

266
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:02,908
Speaker 0: Yep.

267
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,480
Speaker 0: I agree and it beats even the new iOS notification center.

268
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:16,640
Speaker 0: They're also bringing out this integrated Twitter like integrated into the iOS Twitter Which is great competing with the palm free there also, right up cuz palm free.

269
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:16,921
Speaker 1: What.

270
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:22,116
Speaker 1: the only other good thing it had going was that messaging other than Twitter was completely integrated.

271
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:34,579
Speaker 0: Yeah speaking of messaging iMessage which is like what the fuck it's like a messenger that you can only use to message with other people on iOS It's competing with definitely BBM, right as opposed to say, you know, what anything else but it's like.

272
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,508
Speaker 0: Why don't they just put fucking I chat on iOS?

273
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:38,210
Speaker 0: boom done?

274
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:49,840
Speaker 0: And what's so weird right is why would they put I Message right, which is an I you a messaging system where you could only message between Apple devices on the iOS.

275
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:58,920
Speaker 0: but meanwhile IChat is now has support where you can add more modules to it's allowing I chat to chat with anything that has a module.

276
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:03,015
Speaker 0: It's like they opened up the I chat and they closed down with this weird ass.

277
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,883
Speaker 0: I message bullshit on The iOS.

278
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,187
Speaker 0: I don't understand what they're doing there.

279
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:08,652
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

280
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,418
Speaker 1: I actually don't have anything on that one.

281
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:12,672
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, let's see.

282
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:13,239
Speaker 0: What else we got?

283
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:24,540
Speaker 0: Oh, so another thing is most of the features that they announced right almost all of them Right have two things in common right or fall into one or both of two categories, right?

284
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,189
Speaker 0: Number first category is something typical from Apple.

285
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,119
Speaker 0: They act like it's new and it's a hundred years old.

286
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:33,467
Speaker 0: Yeah Think all you're not that?

287
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:36,740
Speaker 0: not that I'm talking about things like we added full screen support.

288
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:47,240
Speaker 0: Whoa, that was like a big deal like full screen and it's like welcome to DOS Welcome to the Apple - everything was full screen, but they're acting like it's a big deal, right?

289
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:48,165
Speaker 0: They're acting.

290
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:59,620
Speaker 0: they come at they come up with a new feature They treat it as if they have invented something when really what they've done is they had you in Locked up this whole time and they've removed one pair of handcuffs.

291
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:08,954
Speaker 0: But they pretend like they've created something new and really all they've done is release a lot You know a lock on you which in a way, I mean, can you fault them for it?

292
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:10,460
Speaker 1: It works really really well.

293
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,685
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it doesn't work.

294
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,400
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's like you got to see through that shit.

295
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,959
Speaker 0: You got to come before that, you know.

296
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,642
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't.

297
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:22,516
Speaker 0: you know what they're adding an OS X lion the ability to resize a window by grabbing it on any edge Instead of just the bottom, right?

298
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,124
Speaker 1: Well, wait, wait, wait Scott.

299
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:29,399
Speaker 1: They're way ahead of a default unconfigured FVWM.

300
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:35,840
Speaker 0: now It's like it's just like when they added spaces and they acted like it was a big deal.

301
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:39,444
Speaker 0: It's like I've only been using a virtual desktop since 1985 on my Amiga.

302
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:44,240
Speaker 1: Hey to be fair Windows doesn't have fucking virtual desk windows fucking retarded.

303
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:55,287
Speaker 0: But actually that Windows 8 looks sorta has virtual desktops sorta sorta I mean effectively doesn't really need him with that interface and props to Microsoft because he looked at the new Xbox Interface that they showed at e3 today.

304
00:17:55,467 --> 00:18:00,123
Speaker 0: They're giving all their stuff that window that Windows Phone 7 interface Which is not.

305
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:08,636
Speaker 0: I actually like it as it's not so bad and whether you like it or not I like being uniform across everything with the same interface.

306
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:09,218
Speaker 0: That's good.

307
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:19,598
Speaker 1: That's Simultaneously, I'm sure that for a long time if you do need some other interface for whatever reason the good old Windows thing will be there because corporate people lose their shit.

308
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,722
Speaker 1: and The

309
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:31,337
Speaker 0: other category of things that they added were features that somebody else was adding and they're basically eating someone else's lunch Right, which is I think we talked about this recently on geek nights where it's like if you go

310
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:32,521
Speaker 1: with the Twitter apps If

311
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:38,800
Speaker 0: you build something on someone else's platform and then they end up basically making you useless, right?

312
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,206
Speaker 0: You can't complain Right?

313
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:41,740
Speaker 0: and that's Apple did a whole bunch of that.

314
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:46,698
Speaker 0: Like there was that iPhone app that used one of the volume buttons to snap the picture and Apple said no.

315
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:47,240
Speaker 0: and now what?

316
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,490
Speaker 0: Are they adding the default camera program?

317
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,038
Speaker 0: You can press the button to take a picture.

318
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:54,609
Speaker 0: It's like There's so many.

319
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:55,859
Speaker 0: there was like a whole list of.

320
00:18:56,901 --> 00:19:03,400
Speaker 0: Someone made a funny list of all the different like third-party apps that are now useless because those features have been integrated into iOS.

321
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:05,160
Speaker 1: Really interesting to me.

322
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:16,324
Speaker 1: Look at the culture of computing now that there was a time when I mean the most apps the majority of apps in any app Store, you know Android web OS iOS whatever are Trivial apps.

323
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:29,607
Speaker 1: They're the kind of thing any competent developer could write in like an afternoon at most Yep, and they basically do almost nothing and in the old days stuff like that was at most at worst Shareware where they're like wins it.

324
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:30,369
Speaker 1: Yeah,

325
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:33,722
Speaker 0: or they were four windows that latches unzip in itself Yeah,

326
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:36,362
Speaker 1: or they were you know various forms of freeware We're like, that's

327
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:45,419
Speaker 0: actually a great example because now wind zip is not needed anymore because Windows has its own unzip But you still need like, you know seven zip because some people some morons ever our files.

328
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:52,740
Speaker 1: But now we have this culture where people will write these tiny meaningless apps that do this tiny tiny thing.

329
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:56,720
Speaker 1: But because the platforms are kind of closed and it's not super obvious how to install stuff.

330
00:19:56,981 --> 00:20:09,880
Speaker 1: You know side-loaded if you even can in certain situations And these people all want to charge like a dollar for it and then they get indignant When someone else implements the thing that they want a dollar for for free because it took them ten minutes to implement it.

331
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:14,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time these are all things that should have been in there already, right?

332
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a separate problem.

333
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:21,460
Speaker 0: There was a great article which is totally true that said hey Look, if you want to write an app for a platform, right?

334
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,920
Speaker 0: Don't write something that adds a feature.

335
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,166
Speaker 0: The platform is missing.

336
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:28,360
Speaker 0: you need to write anything if you want to try to make money doing apps.

337
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,547
Speaker 0: You need to write something that is vertical right?

338
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:34,880
Speaker 0: For example, Apple is never going to ever ever ever ever.

339
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,308
Speaker 0: Create it, you know build in to iOS.

340
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:42,260
Speaker 0: right like a calculator for physicists.

341
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:45,579
Speaker 0: Right like a special physicist thing, right?

342
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,750
Speaker 0: So if you write something that is for physicists and is not for the general populace Then it's never going to be part of iOS.

343
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:53,700
Speaker 0: your app will always have a home there, right?

344
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,557
Speaker 0: But if you do something that's like, you know, here's adds a missing feature to iOS.

345
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:01,619
Speaker 0: Well, that feature might no longer be missing anymore.

346
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,360
Speaker 0: Anyway, and lastly I guess we don't think about the iCloud, right?

347
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,368
Speaker 0: So they came so close with this right.

348
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:18,100
Speaker 0: what I've always wanted right for 10 years 20 years 100 years is why do I have to plug my iPod into fucking computers?

349
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,481
Speaker 1: I don't.

350
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,268
Speaker 1: my Android syncs everything over the wireless.

351
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,176
Speaker 0: It sure does and it's great.

352
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:22,859
Speaker 0: It sure does.

353
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:29,386
Speaker 0: but So the the iOS there with the iCloud They've done a whole bunch of really good stuff.

354
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,496
Speaker 0: in some ways beats the Android and some ways doesn't right.

355
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:34,063
Speaker 0: in some ways It's great.

356
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:35,211
Speaker 0: You're gonna be able to update.

357
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,766
Speaker 0: if they want to update the OS It's just updates just like Android.

358
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:38,831
Speaker 0: you want to update apps.

359
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,378
Speaker 0: They just update all good over the air.

360
00:21:40,518 --> 00:21:42,363
Speaker 0: No problem Just works.

361
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:46,960
Speaker 0: if you want to sync right you can sync with iTunes using the Wi-Fi.

362
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,855
Speaker 0: So it finds your computer with iTunes running and syncs to it.

363
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:50,418
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

364
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,871
Speaker 1: granted I don't want to have to even do that.

365
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:54,680
Speaker 1: I still want to just run it on my iPhone.

366
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,140
Speaker 0: So you can do that too, right?

367
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:08,040
Speaker 0: So if you buy a song right then that song, you know It knows in the database on the cloud that you bought that song and any iTunes up to ten devices that you have will just have that song.

368
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:13,820
Speaker 1: The Amazon store they it's just mp3 and any device I have can download it infinity time, right?

369
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,817
Speaker 0: But this is this difference between can download infinity times and is already downloaded, right?

370
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:20,700
Speaker 0: You see what they did there.

371
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:29,876
Speaker 0: It's like if I buy a song on my phone and I listen to it and then I go and I pick up my iPad And I hope I push the iPod icon and the song is in the library already.

372
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:30,940
Speaker 0: That's a step up.

373
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,553
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like my phone can do with droid.

374
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:34,920
Speaker 0: Can you really do that?

375
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:43,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you buy a song in the Amazon store, yeah, and then you go sit at your computer That song will already be on your computer on the hard drive.

376
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:47,392
Speaker 1: So to make it go on the hard drive I believe I have to do something you have to.

377
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:48,177
Speaker 0: it saves a click.

378
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:49,784
Speaker 0: basically It's one click more.

379
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:55,280
Speaker 1: but the one nice thing is it is almost never that I am not connected to the internet That's true.

380
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:58,893
Speaker 1: So as a result I leave it all in the cloud and just download it as I want it.

381
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:07,678
Speaker 1: and if I'm gonna go on a trick a trip Where I think I'm gonna go out of cell service like on my phone I can just be like download all these albums to my phone right now and then delete them when I'm done.

382
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,056
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway, so I didn't say anything about the podcast.

383
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:13,020
Speaker 0: what how that was gonna work.

384
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,230
Speaker 0: We'll see if it works or not.

385
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,200
Speaker 0: That's a big deal for me at least I don't know about for other people, but anything you buy on iTunes will do that.

386
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:26,760
Speaker 0: Also, if you take say a photo or a document It'll be saved in the cloud and then all your other Apple devices will have it download, you know.

387
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,798
Speaker 1: So unintended consequence and something my droid doesn't do.

388
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:39,239
Speaker 1: yeah There have been a lot like an ever increasing number of stories about police officers Doing bad things and then destroying people's cameras or freaking out when they get filmed or whatever.

389
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,300
Speaker 1: Autosyncing pictures and videos to the cloud is gonna make it a lot harder for cops to get away with stuff like that.

390
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,983
Speaker 0: It's a good thinking.

391
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,329
Speaker 0: I wasn't even thinking along those lines.

392
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,353
Speaker 0: That's a great idea.

393
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:49,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want that for Android.

394
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,016
Speaker 1: I want the option of just sending video I take as soon as is possible to some cloud server.

395
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:54,799
Speaker 0: Well, that's what it does.

396
00:23:55,961 --> 00:24:01,378
Speaker 0: So along all those lines they vastly improved this situation in the way I wanted to.

397
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:09,016
Speaker 0: but There's one problem, which is this whole deal with the the music Matt iTunes match.

398
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,300
Speaker 0: Have you have you read about this?

399
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, well say here's how it works.

400
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,852
Speaker 1: Everyone's got something like this now.

401
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:17,792
Speaker 0: Well, no, here's the way it works Right with Google or Amazon cloud, right?

402
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:24,326
Speaker 0: Let's say I have a CD I ripped or music I pirated from the Pirate Bay and I want to you know Sink it in the cloud.

403
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:26,660
Speaker 0: Well with Google or Amazon I can just upload it to the cloud.

404
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:27,865
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's that's it.

405
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:28,971
Speaker 0: Even if it's pirated.

406
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:29,553
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit.

407
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:35,250
Speaker 1: Yep, theoretically Google claims to have the right to remove pirated material.

408
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,840
Speaker 1: sure if it's pirated Amazon just says whatever as far as I don't care.

409
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:45,380
Speaker 0: So the what Apple's doing is there this is they got one angle on it, which is technological.

410
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:46,405
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good angle.

411
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,436
Speaker 0: But the other angle which is anti piracy.

412
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:49,220
Speaker 0: It's a bad angle, right?

413
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:57,339
Speaker 0: So the good angle is this you don't have to actually upload the music which could admittedly take a long time if you're not like rim with the fires right at my house, it would take forever.

414
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,595
Speaker 0: and Instead what they'll do is you pay $25 a year, which is pricing that I like.

415
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:03,900
Speaker 0: That's my Scott's kind of pricing.

416
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,523
Speaker 0: I'll pay that shit.

417
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:07,437
Speaker 1: double digits per year is pretty much what I want to pay for everything.

418
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:13,110
Speaker 0: Yeah and Then they will scan your music collection and it will see.

419
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,451
Speaker 0: you know using whatever logic it wants if any of your music Matches music that's in iTunes.

420
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:22,470
Speaker 0: and if the music's in iTunes Then it will put that iTunes music.

421
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,840
Speaker 0: make that available to you via the iCloud.

422
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:38,373
Speaker 0: so so if I have buy a CD in the store and I rip it and I have iTunes scan it for $25 a year then all that music from not the not the music from the CD But the music from iTunes would basically be added to my account sort of.

423
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:45,780
Speaker 1: so I take my whole CD collection Run it through and then sell my CD collection for like five bucks to someone who does the same thing, right?

424
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,265
Speaker 0: now here's what I'm waiting for.

425
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:50,497
Speaker 0: when is somebody gonna figure out how to fool this matching system?

426
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:54,460
Speaker 0: and there'll be a thing you can Get from Pirate Bay that gives you every song on iTunes.

427
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:57,689
Speaker 0: That'll be awesome for 25 bucks a year.

428
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then we'll see what Apple does.

429
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,020
Speaker 0: That's right.

430
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,060
Speaker 0: But how awesome would that be though, right?

431
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,985
Speaker 0: That's what they should do.

432
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,736
Speaker 0: is they should just be like look 25 bucks a year.

433
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:05,380
Speaker 0: You get everything.

434
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:09,214
Speaker 0: That's what they should do because who would not pay the $25 a year.

435
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:09,937
Speaker 0: They could make it $100 a year.

436
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:11,408
Speaker 1: I would pay that.

437
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:13,822
Speaker 0: who would not pay $500 a year?

438
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:19,920
Speaker 0: I would pay $500 for all the music in iTunes a hundred percent of it anytime you want on any device.

439
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:20,780
Speaker 1: Hell, you know what?

440
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,619
Speaker 1: I would even pay that if you had if there was a separate higher tier you had to pay for that to get me like.

441
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,398
Speaker 1: basically Music that's new isn't in the lower tier for even six months.

442
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:30,840
Speaker 1: Who cares?

443
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,020
Speaker 0: The thing is I realize the vast majority of the music I have is not in iTunes.

444
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,986
Speaker 0: It's like really they're gonna have.

445
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:47,990
Speaker 0: you know, it's for anybody soundtrack created even available yet Yeah, but it's like Creative Commons music Foreign music old weird music.

446
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:50,960
Speaker 1: Yep, you know not a lot of gemendo music which is all free.

447
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:52,365
Speaker 0: None of that is in there.

448
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:54,593
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's still worth it.

449
00:26:54,734 --> 00:27:01,479
Speaker 0: If just if you have just 25 songs a year So the second year you would need 50 songs.

450
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:10,455
Speaker 0: But if you have that many songs that are not in iTunes then it's worth it to pay for it and I'm sure everyone here has at least a few hundred songs that it would.

451
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,502
Speaker 0: that would match if They met.

452
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:15,175
Speaker 0: if you have that many that match it's worth it to pay the $25 a year for many years.

453
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:26,414
Speaker 0: So I'll probably end up paying it even though I'm waiting for them to use this data from scanning people's music collections This they could use it in good ways in bad ways bad ways detecting piracy.

454
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,019
Speaker 0: Yep good ways.

455
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,128
Speaker 0: What's actually pop figuring out what's popular?

456
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:38,230
Speaker 0: Hey, look at this we've noticed like the superhero be in like hundreds of All these people with superhero be in the u.s.

457
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,716
Speaker 0: My team, uh, who's that?

458
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:40,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, what the fuck is it Lloyd?

459
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,760
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe we should add that to the iTunes, you know.

460
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,529
Speaker 0: And maybe they could do good thing.

461
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,333
Speaker 0: and then what would happen?

462
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,740
Speaker 0: as soon as they added it to iTunes?

463
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:48,807
Speaker 0: Then it would start.

464
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:53,156
Speaker 0: everyone who had it would hit a match Alright, so that'd be pretty good.

465
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:58,060
Speaker 0: But yeah, they they were 90% of the way there but they're not a hundred percent of the way.

466
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,806
Speaker 0: They're a hundred percent of the way there would be.

467
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:05,487
Speaker 0: let me upload my obscure music into the cloud and don't worry You know ignore my pirating ways.

468
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:08,420
Speaker 1: Oh Amazon, maybe Google now, you know.

469
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,995
Speaker 0: But the thing is, you know, the iOS isn't gonna work so well with the Amazon and the Google.

470
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:16,388
Speaker 1: Yeah Look your latitude barely even works.

471
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:17,312
Speaker 0: Not a latitude works.

472
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:17,734
Speaker 0: I know it doesn't.

473
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:18,577
Speaker 1: you're not on ever.

474
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,360
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

475
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,625
Speaker 1: I'm not here to a while ago.

476
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,379
Speaker 1: What I'm on we talking about doesn't even sure where you are right now.

477
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:28,760
Speaker 1: What I gotta go check that's that's what you get for using an Apple product anyway.

478
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:34,156
Speaker 1: So I'm sure everyone's aware of lull sec and that I love lull sec.

479
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:35,482
Speaker 0: Oh kukaku Did you not?

480
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:37,510
Speaker 1: because they're nothing there no one.

481
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,180
Speaker 1: and yet people think there's someone but yet they're doing things.

482
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,095
Speaker 0: No, she's no one doing things and it's like the cult of the dead cow.

483
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:43,457
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:50,710
Speaker 1: It's great but one tiny thing that came out of all sec that I do want to point out is that They're basically attacking everybody.

485
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,600
Speaker 1: and hey, they went after Nintendo.

486
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:02,096
Speaker 1: Nintendo said on Sunday over the weekend that They'd been hacked but that no company or customer information was compromised at all.

487
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:03,400
Speaker 0: What were they gonna compromise?

488
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,800
Speaker 1: Well, and this is why I say props to you Nintendo.

489
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,760
Speaker 1: You have avoided being attacked by lull sec in any substantial way by not actually having any online services.

490
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:13,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are they supposed to attack?

491
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,340
Speaker 1: I mean, they don't even keep your credit card.

492
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,700
Speaker 1: You got to type the fucking number and every time you buy anything.

493
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:23,760
Speaker 0: The one thing though is you know these hacks against Sony and whatever are all trying to get personal data.

494
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:30,880
Speaker 0: And this is the one thing that still bothers me Even though it's a step up from what we had before right where people just try to hack you to make botnets.

495
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:37,059
Speaker 1: Well, though before before I would hack my friends and then open their CD tray while we were playing quake, right?

496
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,907
Speaker 1: No, but the point is and then sniping them.

497
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:41,740
Speaker 0: people have just been hacking for profit, right?

498
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,100
Speaker 0: Now they're hacking to embarrass companies and get personal information, right?

499
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:51,706
Speaker 0: Where are the people who are hacking Maliciously, I want to see.

500
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:53,954
Speaker 0: so, you know, you know don't?

501
00:29:54,014 --> 00:29:55,600
Speaker 0: when you hack Sony, right?

502
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:59,333
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be getting their personal information and shaming them.

503
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:00,417
Speaker 0: That's that's pretty good.

504
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:01,140
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

505
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,327
Speaker 0: It's all about I gotta.

506
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:03,574
Speaker 0: I got a better idea.

507
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:04,480
Speaker 0: I got a better idea.

508
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:08,933
Speaker 0: Why don't you make all the games free for everybody?

509
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:10,658
Speaker 0: That would be awesome, right?

510
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:12,246
Speaker 0: do that And I'll be fucking impressed.

511
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:15,402
Speaker 0: and you know next time you hack some people's computers Don't?

512
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:20,100
Speaker 0: just you know, put some key lager on there and try to get their passwords to their Facebooks, right?

513
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,877
Speaker 0: How about you erase the fucking hard drive like a badass because nobody wants to do that shit anymore.

514
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:28,428
Speaker 1: Remember, there's no Hierarchical organization.

515
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:30,598
Speaker 1: all second things like it are just the.

516
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:37,115
Speaker 1: you know The simmer last similar lacquer coming out of the internet the aid of the internet the collective Movement of individual actors altogether goes to the shell.

517
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:37,578
Speaker 1: blah blah blah.

518
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:42,980
Speaker 1: most people Despite all appearances are not total dicks.

519
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:46,995
Speaker 0: I got his what you know, there was that recent Mac thing Mac defender.

520
00:30:47,015 --> 00:30:50,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, right where they should have done They should have made the Mac defender, right?

521
00:30:50,580 --> 00:31:02,095
Speaker 0: If you got it then it would try to you know Mac defend or offend all the Macs nearby for a certain amount of time and then Destroy the Mac that it's on and then that would cause Apple so much trouble.

522
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:03,600
Speaker 0: It would be so glorious.

523
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:12,780
Speaker 0: I just want to see someone do something really malicious and really damaging not because I wish ill upon people Right, but because it's possible.

524
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:14,585
Speaker 0: Scott it hasn't occurred.

525
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:17,171
Speaker 0: counter-argument and I want to see what happens.

526
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:18,254
Speaker 1: counter-argument.

527
00:31:18,695 --> 00:31:20,600
Speaker 1: Is that not the same thing?

528
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,012
Speaker 1: Aside from the we actually want to see it that we say about terrorism.

529
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:33,020
Speaker 1: smart engineers could cause terrorism Trivially if they wanted to but this doesn't easy to do right, but no one does it.

530
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,542
Speaker 1: But why?

531
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:39,716
Speaker 1: the same reason nobody deletes some poor old guy's computer for no reason because the people who are capable of doing so Not evil yeah.

532
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:46,899
Speaker 1: Well sec and things like it look at the way that these I keep wanting to call them organizations because we don't have good words for these things.

533
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:53,166
Speaker 1: When things like this when simulacra like this Aggregors like this go out and do stuff.

534
00:31:53,186 --> 00:31:54,189
Speaker 1: They're a collective will.

535
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:57,738
Speaker 1: the collective will seems to be primarily concerned with funny pictures of cats.

536
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:07,017
Speaker 1: Yep making people angry without hurting them substantially, yep, and Being socially activist for the things that geeks and nerds care about.

537
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:14,260
Speaker 1: yep So those things together mean shame a company like Sony because Sony is a long history of being dicks about things like DRM.

538
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:22,860
Speaker 0: Still I would really like to see you know The I sort of science fiction story of geeks conquer the world basically hold the world for ransom.

539
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,408
Speaker 0: We're in charge now all evil politicians.

540
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:26,792
Speaker 1: You have five hours.

541
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,979
Speaker 1: Let's get the fuck out in high school nerds rule.

542
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:30,269
Speaker 1: now I don't even know if I have it.

543
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:31,720
Speaker 1: It's probably on one of those dead hard drives.

544
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:34,980
Speaker 1: I wrote a short story that I didn't finish those about that.

545
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:35,806
Speaker 1: It was about that.

546
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:39,699
Speaker 1: it was for a class like the beginning of it And then I tried to finish it, and then I just I don't know what happened to it.

547
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:41,848
Speaker 1: But the premise was it needs a movie.

548
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:54,850
Speaker 1: the premise was that the internet one day declares sovereignty You know like imagine 4chan declaring sovereignty yep, and demanding a seat at the UN and of course everyone ignores it And then like a month later declares war in the world.

549
00:32:55,652 --> 00:33:05,000
Speaker 1: it gives an ultimatum and when that is ignored obviously A shopping cart full of gallon jugs of milk gets simultaneously thrown into every intersection of every major city in the world.

550
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:10,104
Speaker 0: I know you love that one That's your favorite.

551
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:14,219
Speaker 1: and then the internet announces that it did that and that it wants to and then you know it goes from there.

552
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:23,608
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, anyway anyway, but anyway.

553
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,690
Speaker 1: That was a while things of the day.

554
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:29,084
Speaker 1: So there's a movie that Scott loves that I had not seen.

555
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:30,570
Speaker 1: Emily not seen until recently.

556
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:36,503
Speaker 1: Robert Redford Paul Newman some of the data about a con, man It's like everything rim likes in a movie.

557
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:37,630
Speaker 1: I can't believe I hadn't seen this movie.

558
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:42,015
Speaker 0: I kept telling you watch if he took so long Do what I say immediately.

559
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:45,345
Speaker 1: the sting is a fantastic movie, and if you like heist movies.

560
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,038
Speaker 1: It's way up there I'll say it's a con.

561
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:48,785
Speaker 0: It's not a heist.

562
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:53,187
Speaker 1: yeah Well the thing is is a con not simply a form of heist?

563
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:54,793
Speaker 0: no It's not.

564
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:56,439
Speaker 1: has all the elements of a heist movie.

565
00:33:56,479 --> 00:34:02,540
Speaker 1: the big gang that gets together do the really complex Payoff, but they're not robbing something.

566
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,647
Speaker 0: They are tricking a person.

567
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,055
Speaker 0: right It's it's a heist.

568
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:11,510
Speaker 0: is physic is about is about the physicality of breaking in to some hardened structure.

569
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:11,991
Speaker 0: It's about.

570
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:17,547
Speaker 0: it's about buildings and architecture, and you know explosives and drills like you know.

571
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:18,509
Speaker 0: I can die hard right.

572
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:28,597
Speaker 0: but You know a con is all about trickery and manipulation and acting and putting on Disguises and all that sort of stuff.

573
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:29,860
Speaker 0: It's you know the the.

574
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,969
Speaker 0: the execution of it is a completely different skill set completely.

575
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:43,143
Speaker 1: You know anyway the movies great, and I'm you know if you've watched any number of movies You'll figure out what the fullness of the whole thing is and it's pretty good.

576
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:50,282
Speaker 1: if you've read the lives of Locke Lamora I'm Pretty sure Scott Lynch saw this movie and cribbed from it.

577
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:51,607
Speaker 1: It's too close.

578
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:54,377
Speaker 0: You don't say And three.

579
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:55,730
Speaker 1: it'll give you a ton of inside jokes.

580
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:02,150
Speaker 1: For we almost watched this other movie called alphaville that many people have seen and commented on how they should watch it in Netflix.

581
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:04,337
Speaker 1: Don't watch it the ball.

582
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,140
Speaker 0: I couldn't finish it.

583
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,485
Speaker 0: so who knows what has the plot.

584
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,970
Speaker 0: I'll probably finish it at some point.

585
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to know what the deal is but the plot is as such.

586
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:14,090
Speaker 1: There's a really hard-boiled detective guy report.

587
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:22,530
Speaker 1: He works for newspaper Yeah in a noir futurist setting and every five minutes someone comes out of a closet with a gun comes out of the closet.

588
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:37,168
Speaker 1: So anyway my thing of the day other than the fact that it was weird to see Robert Redford looking young and kind of Brad Pitt ish I'm used to seeing him very old is a is a time waster.

589
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,816
Speaker 1: on Wikipedia This will take about an hour of your life away.

590
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,270
Speaker 1: It is the Wikipedia page that lists confidence tricks.

591
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:56,985
Speaker 1: so if you've ever heard the term pigeon drop or the Spanish prisoner or The wire or the pig in the poke or the badger game You'll learn all about them, and there's a lot of links to follow.

592
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,330
Speaker 0: you could learn everything on the internet.

593
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:01,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you've read American gods you probably know some of these.

594
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,189
Speaker 0: all right, so rim you ready for this right?

595
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,521
Speaker 0: Have you ever heard of Capricars operation?

596
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:06,507
Speaker 0: nope all right?

597
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:06,789
Speaker 0: You ready?

598
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,523
Speaker 0: Take any four digit number, but the four digits can't all be the same.

599
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:15,453
Speaker 1: so I picked one one one one fine One one two.

600
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:16,277
Speaker 0: you can't all right.

601
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:17,342
Speaker 0: one one one two is fine.

602
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,010
Speaker 0: You just can't do one one one one all right.

603
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:26,578
Speaker 0: Okay, now rearrange the digits right to make the biggest number You can make and also the smallest number.

604
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,445
Speaker 0: so for your number one one one two.

605
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:31,946
Speaker 0: the biggest number you can make Two one one one and the smallest is one one two.

606
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:37,697
Speaker 0: Subtract the smaller one from the bigger one all right What's the?

607
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,525
Speaker 0: what's your result there?

608
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:43,023
Speaker 0: 999 not oh zero nine nine nine.

609
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:44,590
Speaker 0: yeah, right, okay?

610
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,277
Speaker 0: Take Zero nine nine nine.

611
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:50,770
Speaker 0: yeah, right and repeat Capricars operation again.

612
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,586
Speaker 0: So take the biggest thing you can possibly make and subtract from it the smallest thing you could possibly make.

613
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:58,181
Speaker 0: so nine nine nine zero minus zero.

614
00:36:58,241 --> 00:36:58,725
Speaker 0: nine nine nine.

615
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:01,001
Speaker 1: Wait nine nine one.

616
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:02,028
Speaker 0: eight nine nine one.

617
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:02,310
Speaker 0: okay?

618
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:03,514
Speaker 0: Do it a few more times.

619
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,662
Speaker 1: if I recurse this it's gonna get me back where I was.

620
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:06,926
Speaker 0: no not at all.

621
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,499
Speaker 0: I Guarantee recurse it up a few times.

622
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,042
Speaker 0: keep doing it.

623
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:13,168
Speaker 0: Just real quick all right I'll just give you a minute there.

624
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,090
Speaker 0: Eventually what's gonna happen is you arrive at a number and once you arrive at that number?

625
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:25,070
Speaker 0: You will arrive at that number every time because that number if you perform Capricars operation on it results in itself yet again.

626
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,154
Speaker 1: Uh-huh so far.

627
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:27,078
Speaker 1: I haven't hit that yet.

628
00:37:27,118 --> 00:37:28,906
Speaker 1: I've gone through about four iterations in my.

629
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:29,710
Speaker 0: it might take a few more.

630
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,497
Speaker 0: It's it it will happen.

631
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:32,782
Speaker 1: so is it always the same number?

632
00:37:32,842 --> 00:37:33,364
Speaker 1: is that the deal?

633
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:34,830
Speaker 0: it is absolutely always the same number.

634
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,429
Speaker 0: I've written that number on this piece of paper.

635
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:39,364
Speaker 0: How much would you like to bet that I am correct or not?

636
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:40,430
Speaker 1: well you see?

637
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:48,020
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that since you probably just looked this up that you know the number already And I trust mathematicians to be accurate.

638
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:52,558
Speaker 1: so the smart part of my brain says to bet Negative ten dollars.

639
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,484
Speaker 1: Do you accept my bet?

640
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:54,229
Speaker 0: no?

641
00:37:55,531 --> 00:38:02,899
Speaker 0: It must be if I will bet a positive amount of money that I am correct any negative amount of money that That you and I have.

642
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:03,789
Speaker 0: you arrived at the number yet?

643
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:04,875
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

644
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:11,237
Speaker 1: it's kind of tedious actually to do this since I got a microphone in front of me but anyway the number is Six thousand one hundred and seventy four.

645
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:13,305
Speaker 0: uh-huh how fucked up is that?

646
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:14,790
Speaker 0: so this website?

647
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,112
Speaker 0: Explains to you.

648
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:16,794
Speaker 0: Why this is true.

649
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,057
Speaker 1: does it have pictures?

650
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:30,806
Speaker 0: it has many pictures and charts and proofs and tables and graphs and It's actually Pretty incredible And it's sort of freaking me out, but why is it six one seven four?

651
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:31,630
Speaker 1: Why is it pie?

652
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,555
Speaker 1: Why is it e?

653
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:36,524
Speaker 0: I know right, but it's something about six one E to the pie.

654
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:39,135
Speaker 1: I oh Shit, oh shit.

655
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:45,237
Speaker 0: I think that this is the bride the fifth most fucked up thing in math after Either the pie.

656
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:46,488
Speaker 0: I is always gonna be the winner.

657
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:53,830
Speaker 0: This is mysterious number six one seven four by you Taka Nishiyama a very smart, man.

658
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,950
Speaker 1: So you know what I'll bet if you're ever trying to break into a nerd's locker.

659
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:03,334
Speaker 0: six one seven four Whoa New pin number everybody.

660
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:09,009
Speaker 0: I believe you mean pin dun dun dun for the ATM machine.

661
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:14,382
Speaker 0: yeah Automatic ATM machine all right, it's it's.

662
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:15,990
Speaker 0: it's metamoment all right.

663
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,239
Speaker 1: So you know you many people saw.

664
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,267
Speaker 1: I uploaded it without much fanfare last night.

665
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:28,003
Speaker 1: for a long time I've been hinting that we may have made a spin-off show that was in Production and you took and you took way too long.

666
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:30,031
Speaker 0: you said you were gonna have it out weeks ago Yep,

667
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:44,393
Speaker 1: and I ran into a lot of trouble partly because all the very high-quality sources that I downloaded in torrents have really washed out color in them and the YouTube versions and the TV versions have the correct colors and FFD show.

668
00:39:44,574 --> 00:39:48,990
Speaker 1: I can use that to convert them to the correct colors, but that was very anyway.

669
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,530
Speaker 0: The point is is that you don't know how to do things quickly.

670
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:57,310
Speaker 1: I was also busy doing other things like the fact that you know I'm scheduling every panel for kinetic on and such.

671
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:09,819
Speaker 1: Also, we brought it out kind of right as the the pony Love was starting to not not fade But falter and slumber and wait for the following season.

672
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:19,150
Speaker 1: the updates were drying up the PMVs were slowing down and suddenly Oh shit, it's radio free equestria coming to you live from the everfree forest.

673
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:24,204
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Scott and I started a legit my little pony video show.

674
00:40:24,364 --> 00:40:25,126
Speaker 0: we'll see how it goes.

675
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,936
Speaker 1: we have one pilot up Uploaded last night with very little fanfare.

676
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:32,505
Speaker 1: It got a surprising number of video views almost immediately.

677
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:36,529
Speaker 1: a lot of positive commentary Mmm, so we'll see where this goes.

678
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:52,509
Speaker 1: every other week probably to start the show will go up and then as soon as I have the production process down it'll go to every week and If the pilots are all successful and you people like this we will see about making it a much more legit show.

679
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:54,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

680
00:40:54,314 --> 00:40:58,574
Speaker 0: you know plus it depends how long pony I mean if the show ever ends It's like how we supposed to.

681
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:03,730
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean of course many of those Firefly podcasts are going to this fucking day.

682
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:04,743

702
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:01,271
Speaker 0: Recess nerd NYC racist is Saturday the 18th of June game hack days in New York and June 25th and 26.

703
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,977
Speaker 0: Yep, I just search for game hack.

704
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:04,864
Speaker 1: We might not be at the recess.

705
00:42:04,924 --> 00:42:06,470
Speaker 1: We might be doing our own thing.

706
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,089
Speaker 0: That doesn't mean you shouldn't go to recess.

707
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:18,020
Speaker 0: However, if you go to recess and I don't know maybe if we don't start dragging out this meta moment I'm trying to just go through it real quick like You keep adding all these add stuff to keep adding all these details.

708
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,963
Speaker 0: the show is already long.

709
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:19,705
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

710
00:42:20,186 --> 00:42:20,849
Speaker 0: it is okay.

711
00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:26,981
Speaker 0: I think that's all the meta there is.

712
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:28,188
Speaker 1: is it all the meta there is?

713
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:39,700
Speaker 1: Good friend of ours talked about on the show a while ago going in a massive Many mile bike ride with the team easy riders to support the funding to hopefully try to get rid of Lou Gehrig's disease.

714
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:46,418
Speaker 1: Okay, good luck with that good friend of ours who also happens to be planning to walk around the world Mmm-hmm.

715
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:54,588
Speaker 1: So if you want to support this at all I would highly recommend you donate a small amount of money to his cause or a large amount if you have it All right.

716
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:55,456
Speaker 0: Do you have a URL for that shit?

719
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:06,960
Speaker 0: Well, that's for money for other people instead.

720
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we'll kickstart if we want to do another show because of one last announcement.

721
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,767
Speaker 1: We you know radio free equestria is finally going.

722
00:43:13,907 --> 00:43:18,200

723
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:21,666
Speaker 0: third show We're doing a lot.

725
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:29,873
Speaker 1: geek nights will always be here, but We reserve the right to possibly make money off of other non geek nights things.

726
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,698
Speaker 0: They'll still be creative comes.

727
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:37,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much Anyway anyway, so it's warm real warm lately.

728
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:41,738
Speaker 1: So we thought we'd talk about computer cooling because we've never actually talked about that.

729
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:47,180
Speaker 0: specifically We talk about overclocking which I think we covered a lot of cooling some up our overclocking episode.

730
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:49,028
Speaker 1: It's no longer a good idea.

731
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,616
Speaker 1: What the fuck you doing you fanboy?

732
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:52,685
Speaker 0: Yeah Just you know.

733
00:43:52,705 --> 00:43:56,239
Speaker 0: to sum that up in a couple more sentences your hobbyist and go nuts, right?

734
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,094
Speaker 0: It's like if your goal is to just have fun overclocking.

735
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:00,100
Speaker 0: well go nuts, right?

736
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,698
Speaker 0: But if you want to overclock for performance, that's just a bad idea.

737
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:05,184
Speaker 0: nowadays There's no reason to.

738
00:44:05,224 --> 00:44:06,811
Speaker 0: you could just get a better CPU.

739
00:44:06,992 --> 00:44:13,873
Speaker 0: also if you have a normal computer There's really no reason to ever use anything but the heatsink that comes with the CPU.

740
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:14,395
Speaker 0: right there.

741
00:44:14,455 --> 00:44:17,764
Speaker 0: in my Intel every Intel chip I've ever bought comes with the heatsink.

742
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:19,670
Speaker 0: that heatsink is perfectly fine.

743
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:20,613
Speaker 0: It's quiet.

744
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:21,496
Speaker 0: It works.

745
00:44:21,777 --> 00:44:27,180
Speaker 0: if you're having trouble with it It's probably cuz you have a stupid case and that leads us into the current show.

746
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,544
Speaker 1: So let's talk about cases.

747
00:44:29,006 --> 00:44:33,460
Speaker 1: pretty much there is no longer any goddamn reason to get a full tower.

748
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:37,802
Speaker 1: No that the last full tower I bought was the previous computer I owned.

749
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:40,412
Speaker 1: it was a gigantic tower because I set up.

750
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:42,280
Speaker 1: I put a ton of hard drives in it.

751
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:49,720
Speaker 1: I even got to the point where if I wanted to add more hard drives I was gonna put in a second power supply just for the hard drive and raid them all together.

752
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,162
Speaker 1: You know what?

753
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:54,136
Speaker 1: by the time I got that going computer technology moved along so fast.

754
00:44:54,176 --> 00:44:55,220
Speaker 1: It didn't even matter anymore.

755
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, but nowadays right it's like you can move all your hard drives.

756
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:01,822
Speaker 0: You only need one hard drive in the computer probably solid-state I would.

757
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:05,733
Speaker 1: you can put I would argue you want to you know one solid-state drive.

758
00:45:05,974 --> 00:45:08,785
Speaker 1: that usually won't be that big and you put Your OS on it.

759
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:11,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need a second hard drive.

760
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,071
Speaker 1: Just get the biggest fucking cheap drive ever for local storage.

761
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,376
Speaker 1: Like I'm editing video.

762
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:16,440
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna edit video.

763
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,607
Speaker 1: That's all stored on an Ethernet net.

764
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:22,160
Speaker 0: No if you're editing video put it on the fucking solid-state where it's the fastest.

765
00:45:23,383 --> 00:45:24,206
Speaker 0: Well, you got to get big ones.

766
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:27,320
Speaker 1: you got to see you're gonna spend a 64 gig one wouldn't be big enough.

767
00:45:27,682 --> 00:45:30,636
Speaker 0: If you're not you gotta get the 128 first of all wouldn't be big enough.

768
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:31,038
Speaker 0: two of them.

769
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:32,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna spend that much.

770
00:45:32,935 --> 00:45:33,299
Speaker 0: Why not?

771
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, these games are actually not big enough to justify their rear real big.

772
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:41,215
Speaker 1: For the kinds of video editing you're better.

773
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:42,220
Speaker 0: That's your editing a video.

774
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,676
Speaker 0: You just get the whole video in RAM while you're editing you only write it to disk when you're saving it.

775
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:50,777
Speaker 1: Ah The most RAM I've ever had in a workstation is Bob 24 gigs.

776
00:45:51,098 --> 00:45:53,041
Speaker 0: That's enough Depends.

777
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,675
Speaker 0: The point is is that you don't need really that many drives in your computer.

778
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:58,080
Speaker 0: You definitely don't need optical drive anymore.

779
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,747
Speaker 0: You definitely don't need more than one video card.

780
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,816
Speaker 1: If you're a performance nut have one solid-state drive.

781
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:05,497
Speaker 1: Just the OS.

782
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:11,016
Speaker 1: two Cheap hard drives just for like local scratch face working storage.

783
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:12,320
Speaker 1: Like I downloaded a bunch of shit.

784
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,847
Speaker 1: I'm working on it, you know torrent whatever.

785
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:16,680
Speaker 1: just make a raid zero or raid one doesn't matter.

786
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,394
Speaker 0: And if the drives crash who cares you?

787
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:21,549
Speaker 1: just replace them cheap And then buy a super cheap NAS.

788
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:22,614
Speaker 1: I got a netgear NAS.

789
00:46:22,936 --> 00:46:23,739
Speaker 1: I can see it from here.

790
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:29,180
Speaker 1: It's got two two terabyte hard drives in it and they're just rated together perfectly.

791
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I lose the drive just pop another one.

792
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,360
Speaker 1: every populates gigabit Ethernet shared everywhere.

793
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:36,580
Speaker 1: It has some problems just because it's consumer grade shit.

794
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,366
Speaker 0: But you gotta get a higher quality.

795
00:46:38,406 --> 00:46:42,400
Speaker 1: those problems are all related to the administration of the thing not to the performance of the thing.

796
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:46,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, you know the point is you don't really need a big computer anymore.

797
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,620
Speaker 0: But a lot of people have taken this to the extreme and they try to get small computers, right?

798
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,619
Speaker 1: Well, don't get a micro ATX unless you're making a HD PC.

799
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:59,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like a lot of you know, I can understand the desire to get something like, you know, that's Mac mini sized, right?

800
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,268
Speaker 0: Because small and quiet is just so awesome.

801
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:04,135
Speaker 1: If you don't need performance go for that.

802
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:05,220
Speaker 0: just buy the mag, right?

803
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,589
Speaker 0: But you got to keep in mind if you.

804
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:12,053
Speaker 0: well you can buy the Mac mini itself sure But if you want to build something really small make sure you keep it really weak.

805
00:47:12,113 --> 00:47:19,997
Speaker 0: a lot of people I've noticed because they can And because they sell these parts have been putting full power computers inside a very tiny case.

806
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:28,131
Speaker 1: now you can do that But you need to really ramp up the cooling which is gonna make the thing fucking loud Which defeats the purpose of having a computer in your living room.

807
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:30,100
Speaker 1: and why else would you want a tiny computer?

808
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, just get you know a mid tower or just you know, they have these sort of half-ish mid towers.

809
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,074
Speaker 0: Those are those are good enough mid towers pretty much what you want.

810
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:38,878
Speaker 1: I would argue.

811
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:47,369
Speaker 0: Yeah It's definitely good, you know while it might be a little bigger than say one of those like half-towery things but you can still get away with it was.

812
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:57,277
Speaker 0: it's so much easier even though it's mostly empty air and The cooling is just gonna work and it's gonna be so quiet and you can still put it underneath your desk where it won't get In the way, so who cares now, I wouldn't?

813
00:47:57,317 --> 00:47:57,620
Speaker 0: it's cheap.

814
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:06,915
Speaker 1: I used to also get a full tower because I had a bunch of shit in the front of my computer like, you know My DVD drive my CD burner my no one has any that shit drive.

815
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:08,120
Speaker 0: It's not just all gone.

816
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,450
Speaker 1: It was in front of my computer a $10 DVD burner.

817
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,057
Speaker 1: It burns every possible format.

818
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:15,744
Speaker 0: It's super fast and you never use it.

819
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:24,115
Speaker 1: I burned an ISO a Month ago to rebuild a server to put counter-strike.

820
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,260
Speaker 0: I use USB sticks for that.

821
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:26,868
Speaker 1: Ah, this this is a computer you gave me.

822
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:27,713
Speaker 1: the USB is broken.

823
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:28,417
Speaker 0: No shit.

824
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:32,551
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a reason I got rid of that computer and you know what.

825
00:48:32,572 --> 00:48:34,000
Speaker 1: that computer didn't have an optical drive.

826
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,900
Speaker 1: I had to pull mine out and plug it into that one snap.

827
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:47,341
Speaker 1: But anyway, so, uh, very simply though, you know get a mid-tower get a reasonable, you know Get like an Intel chip or even if you get an AMD chip just use the default cooler Don't?

828
00:48:47,682 --> 00:48:51,172
Speaker 0: a lot of people buy like these fancy coolers the thing coolers that look fancy.

829
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:53,378
Speaker 0: They're usually a bad idea, right?

830
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:02,928
Speaker 0: They're just bigger and stupider and they cost extra money and they probably use more electricity and they make more noise Whether or not they actually cool the thing down.

831
00:49:02,968 --> 00:49:06,340
Speaker 0: and also, you know, a lot of people try to excessively cool, right?

832
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,268
Speaker 0: It's like as long as your CPU is always within the recommended operating temperature It doesn't need to be any colder.

833
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,440
Speaker 0: being colder isn't really gonna help you, right?

834
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,980
Speaker 0: It's like oh my compete my CPU is running at 70 and now it's running at 50.

835
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,707
Speaker 0: It's like well with 70 within the limits.

836
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,353
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, well then what the fuck's the problem?

837
00:49:22,574 --> 00:49:27,175
Speaker 1: and also I mean, alright It's not gonna go faster now not gonna cool it loads.

838
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,300
Speaker 0: I told you not to overclock.

839
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,156
Speaker 1: You're not gonna cool it lower than the ambient temperature with a heatsink.

840
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:31,800
Speaker 0: That's right.

841
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,528
Speaker 1: So fans get big fans.

842
00:49:35,648 --> 00:49:38,215
Speaker 1: big slow fans are better than small fast fans.

843
00:49:38,597 --> 00:49:39,700
Speaker 1: any goddamn day.

844
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:46,833
Speaker 0: Yep, because a big fan have one like Gigantic fan or two gigantic fans one of the front one of the back.

845
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,440
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I got a standard antique case.

846
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:55,137
Speaker 1: It's got two pretty big fans in the front intake one Gigantic fan in the top and then it's got the power supply fan.

847
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:56,706
Speaker 1: That's it What works great.

848
00:49:56,806 --> 00:50:04,040
Speaker 0: the reason gigantic fans are so much better than small fans Right is because it's all about how many cubic centimeters of air it pushes per unit time.

849
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,284
Speaker 1: But also small fans.

850
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:10,623
Speaker 0: they can push the same amount of air, but that means they have to spin faster Which means they're louder.

851
00:50:10,723 --> 00:50:11,806
Speaker 1: Yes, and they were out.

852
00:50:12,047 --> 00:50:16,420
Speaker 0: loudness is come almost entirely determined by how what the rpms are.

853
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:22,260
Speaker 0: So a big fan at low rpm pushes the same amount of air at a small fan at higher rpm.

854
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:29,918
Speaker 0: Which is why a bigger fan is better because it can provide the same amount of cooling with less noise and less Spinach, right?

855
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:32,748
Speaker 0: So big fans always win if you can.

856
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:35,278
Speaker 1: so you have a case and a CPU and a motherboard.

857
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,084
Speaker 1: really not CPU But a motherboard that supports it.

858
00:50:37,606 --> 00:50:40,979
Speaker 1: use dynamic fans and then you know set the hardware switches as low as they can go.

859
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, my fans speed up if my computer is actually overheating.

860
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:44,811
Speaker 1: Yep.

861
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:46,415
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy to set that up.

862
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,040
Speaker 1: Just actually read the documentation.

863
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:59,669
Speaker 1: Don't bother with the additional side blowhole whale fan unless your case is overheating like for example, if you have a Gigantic set of video cards or something.

864
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:02,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you shouldn't really have those because they're waste of money.

865
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:08,180
Speaker 0: But then again, if I want a lottery and I was building a computer I might be tempted to get like for and video or for example.

866
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:09,529
Speaker 0: So get there's.

867
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,140
Speaker 0: I got so much money working with video.

868
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:17,079
Speaker 1: Right if I am rendering a video from for like radio free equestria took about an hour to render that right?

869
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:24,975
Speaker 1: My computer heated up substantially and hot air was blowing uncomfortably out of the area where my computer is.

870
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:31,404
Speaker 1: hmm and The you know could have caused a problem if I was rendering like a hundred things in a row over a weekend while I was Out of town.

871
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:39,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm thinking about getting the side fan But only get the side fan if you need it because it's gonna add loudness Lot of loudness and loudness is the thing I care about more than almost anything.

872
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:42,399
Speaker 1: Yep They'll arrange your cables.

873
00:51:42,922 --> 00:51:50,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people they don't know how to arrange your cables properly and it can sometimes be tricky depending on what parts you Get how long their cables are what your case is like.

874
00:51:51,014 --> 00:51:52,200
Speaker 1: it's a pain in the ass.

875
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,899
Speaker 1: It'll take you forever And if you're not good at it.

876
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,220
Speaker 1: You're probably gonna have to tear it all out and do it again after you're done.

877
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,444
Speaker 1: And this is another

878
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:17,907
Speaker 0: reason for the mid tower because while the mid tower you don't need all that space for the actual computer because Your computer is gonna like be like a tiny speck inside that big box That gives you a lot of places to hide and squish and stow all these Cables that aren't being used and you're just getting in the way for much more efficient cooling Right.

879
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:22,700
Speaker 0: So that's why you get the mid tower Even if your computer could fit in something like half or a quarter of the size.

880
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,393
Speaker 1: Luckily, it's becoming mood because no one needs, you know, serial ATA cables anymore.

881
00:52:26,414 --> 00:52:30,440
Speaker 1: Well parallel ATA cables Yeah, and serial ATA cables are tiny.

882
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:36,100
Speaker 1: Yeah used to be that you needed ribbon cables or if you were fancy you'd break a ribbon cable up and then band it together.

883
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,992
Speaker 0: It's mostly all about the the power supply cables.

884
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:40,800
Speaker 1: I know we really need a better solution.

885
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,725
Speaker 0: Well, they do have.

886
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:45,124
Speaker 0: there are some power supplies that where you could actually fuck that You know what?

887
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:45,429
Speaker 1: I want.

888
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:46,139
Speaker 1: you know what I want.

889
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:51,600
Speaker 1: I want there to be a standard like ATX for cases where cases include buses.

890
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:54,706
Speaker 1: Yeah You put you slide the power supply in.

891
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:56,412
Speaker 1: there are bus bars and wires.

892
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,842
Speaker 1: in the case you slide the hard drive hard drive can Closure in.

893
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,373
Speaker 1: it has ports for the power for the hard drives just built in.

894
00:53:03,855 --> 00:53:05,059
Speaker 1: why the fuck don't we have that?

895
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,085
Speaker 0: It's 2011 cuz it would.

896
00:53:07,246 --> 00:53:08,170
Speaker 0: you know, cuz it's a little bit.

897
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,235
Speaker 0: It's a less flexible.

898
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,863
Speaker 0: You know, I do it that way All right.

899
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:12,670
Speaker 1: Wait, how is it less flexible though?

900
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,240
Speaker 0: So let's say you have a slot for a hard drive, right?

901
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,211
Speaker 0: Well, it's an SAT hard drive.

902
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:18,440
Speaker 0: So it's got the SAT a plugs.

903
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,400
Speaker 0: But what if I want to put it on if I have a regular old hard drive?

904
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,705
Speaker 0: My motherboard supports it.

905
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,188
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

906
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see here's this is where they're probably leave.

907
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,872
Speaker 1: You leave a legacy port in the bottom or something, right?

908
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,500
Speaker 0: So that was a useless slot in my computer.

909
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,609
Speaker 0: I want to add another SAT a but there isn't one.

910
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:32,694
Speaker 1: it was not that long ago.

911
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:34,180
Speaker 1: My computer had an ISA slot.

912
00:53:34,723 --> 00:53:35,870
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's like now.

913
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,620
Speaker 0: I've got one more SAT a drive.

914
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:46,640
Speaker 1: But my case has a built-in non SAT a slot and also if you make the standard to start then people start supporting it and eventually you get to the point where everything does it.

915
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,266
Speaker 1: Then you just drop the ISA slot.

916
00:53:48,707 --> 00:53:52,120
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is that you know, it's significantly lower.

917
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,359
Speaker 1: Distribution inside of consumer PCs that are built by nerds has not gotten better in 20 years?

918
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,025
Speaker 0: No, not really.

919
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:06,019
Speaker 0: and there were the power supplies to let you remove the cables You weren't using but those for some reason never caught on that.

920
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:09,680
Speaker 1: now The only reason I'm not super mad about it is that in the old days?

921
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,138
Speaker 1: I'd open my computer up surprisingly often for various reasons.

922
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:17,092
Speaker 1: Yep I haven't reopened my computer down there since I built it.

923
00:54:17,112 --> 00:54:19,560
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm times have changed and they're better.

924
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:21,779
Speaker 1: So there's no market for what I just said.

925
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:29,551
Speaker 1: But if I were like Dell or gateway like his game if I was Dell I would do that on my own for my own piece.

926
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:31,860
Speaker 0: Well, they basically sort of do right is you know?

927
00:54:32,462 --> 00:54:33,466
Speaker 1: They do a lot of good stuff.

928
00:54:33,506 --> 00:54:36,720
Speaker 1: if you they have not gotten to the point of integrating bus bars with the case.

929
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:40,074
Speaker 0: No, I don't think it's just not economical now, but it would.

930
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:42,800
Speaker 1: it might be in the long run I could make a case for it.

931
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:47,919
Speaker 0: Anyway, the other thing right is that it's all about you want to have more intake.

932
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:50,853
Speaker 0: You know people always think about exhaust fans like this hot air.

933
00:54:50,893 --> 00:54:52,160
Speaker 0: I got to push it out of the computer.

934
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:54,447
Speaker 0: Well, no You also need to bring in the cold air.

935
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:54,667
Speaker 0: now.

936
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:57,256
Speaker 1: bringing in air is better for two very obvious reasons.

937
00:54:57,437 --> 00:55:01,088
Speaker 1: one if you put filters On your intakes, there's no dust in your computer.

938
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:04,760
Speaker 0: now if you usually yeah positive pressure is more important than filters, right?

939
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:08,980
Speaker 1: So well, I'm not up because if you have positive pressure and filters, you're all set.

940
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,703
Speaker 1: No dust gets in.

941
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:13,660
Speaker 1: if you have positive pressure and no filters your computer is still gonna fill with dust.

942
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:21,395
Speaker 1: But if you have negative pressure The dust is going to be sucked in through your optical drive that you hardly ever use.

943
00:55:21,616 --> 00:55:23,791
Speaker 1: and the one time you put a DVD In it, it's not gonna work.

944
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:24,579
Speaker 1: It's covered in dust.

945
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:26,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's odd.

946
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:29,600
Speaker 0: the reason, you know dust in your computer probably won't actually ruin your computer.

947
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:36,340
Speaker 0: But what it will do is it'll make the you know, it'll get in the fans It'll get on the heat sinks and make them heat let you know cool less efficiently.

948
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:43,934
Speaker 1: But if you have negative pressure and no filters and you don't have any optical drives or anything It is arguable that there is no effective difference.

949
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:50,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, so positive pressure What that means is that the air pressure inside your case right is greater than the air pressure of the room.

950
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,985
Speaker 0: So greater than what atmosphere?

951
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:52,668
Speaker 0: right?

952
00:55:52,688 --> 00:56:00,660
Speaker 0: you do this usually by having intake fans that are Bringing in a lot more air than the exhaust fans are exhausting out, right?

953
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:08,840
Speaker 0: You still need exhaust fans To in the areas where the air is the hottest like right near the CPU to blow out the hottest of airs in the computer.

954
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:14,860
Speaker 0: But the intake fans are bringing in cool air probably from the front of your computer just the air in your room.

955
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,140
Speaker 0: So they're bringing in room temperature air, which is gonna be cooler than what's in the computer.

956
00:56:19,622 --> 00:56:24,340
Speaker 0: So they bring in more room temperature air then the hot air that you're blowing out.

957
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:33,530
Speaker 0: That's gonna keep the temperature low And also the fact that the inside the case the pressure is higher than it is outside the case Dust can't get in because there's basically air.

958
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:50,066
Speaker 0: come all the seams in your computer cuz it's not airtight Right all the seams all around the optical drive all around the edges of the case air is gonna become getting pushed out Sort of like when you stand next to a doorway and the room on the other side has different pressure and like a wind coming Out of this cracked open doorway.

959
00:56:50,447 --> 00:56:55,180
Speaker 0: your case will be like that and dust won't get inside Which is totally awesome.

960
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,867
Speaker 0: And if you don't have that you get it wrong.

961
00:56:56,967 --> 00:57:00,763
Speaker 1: dust will get in through the main fans in taking air if you don't have Filters on them.

962
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:04,240
Speaker 0: Yes, obviously, but the point is if you set it up, right?

963
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,639
Speaker 0: There won't be any dust in your computer, you know hot air will be getting pushed out.

964
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:10,540
Speaker 0: cool They're will be getting pushed in to be totally awesome.

965
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,567
Speaker 0: If you have negative pressure you fucked up.

966
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:18,427
Speaker 1: if you don't have the discipline to clean your filters Don't bother with filters just once a month.

967
00:57:18,508 --> 00:57:20,935
Speaker 1: open your computer and air, you know, just air dust it all out.

968
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:21,336
Speaker 1: Yep.

969
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,987
Speaker 1: Uh That's mostly it.

970
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:33,356
Speaker 1: I mean don't put your computer in a cupboard Yeah, don't smoke In your house ever ever ruin your computer.

971
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:38,160
Speaker 0: Yep Now there's also bother with any weird fancy cooling.

972
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:39,828
Speaker 0: Well, yeah water cooling right.

973
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:45,480
Speaker 0: so water cooling if you do make it work It is kind of cool because it makes no noise.

974
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, dude, well and he keeps everything say it makes no noise, but most people I've seen it makes no noise except for the pump.

975
00:57:52,122 --> 00:57:53,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you can get.

976
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,978
Speaker 0: you can get some of these, you know quiet pumps.

977
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,489
Speaker 0: and you know I've seen water cooling systems where you may be here.

978
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,433
Speaker 0: It sounds like a fish tank.

979
00:57:59,454 --> 00:58:00,217
Speaker 0: It's a quiet bubbling.

980
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:04,193
Speaker 0: It's actually soothing Yeah, or I've heard completely quiet ones as well get around.

981
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:08,999
Speaker 0: you can try like heat pipe things Lots of stuff that you can do and it actually works.

982
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:12,837
Speaker 1: They're really only do these things if you're a hobbyist.

983
00:58:13,058 --> 00:58:20,020
Speaker 1: exactly Are you gonna make very very specific need if you're making case mods or like say you're made you're making a computer.

984
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:24,560
Speaker 1: That's gonna be inside of a recording studio for whatever reason and it has to be as quiet as possible.

985
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:30,860
Speaker 1: So you set up an air a water cooling rig where the pipes come from outside the room cool it and go back outside the room.

986
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:32,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, even recording studios don't do that shit.

987
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:33,932
Speaker 0: They just get really quiet.

988
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:36,160
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what you're doing.

989
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:38,059
Speaker 0: I've never heard of a recording studio doing that.

990
00:58:38,903 --> 00:58:40,540
Speaker 1: Well, usually you're not gonna have a computer in there anyway.

991
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:46,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know the thing is is that if you know there are reasons to do water cooling, you know Especially if just you want to do it for fun.

992
00:58:46,906 --> 00:58:53,660
Speaker 1: You go for it liquid nitrogen, but immersion and all that It's fun and silly but don't it's not for any practical purpose.

993
00:58:53,881 --> 00:59:00,579
Speaker 0: It's completely pointless and unnecessary because there is no consumer computer that you can't cool with just normal old fans and heat sinks.

994
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:07,880
Speaker 0: in a good case Right the old water cooling is only necessary if you're doing something really fancy or you just want to do it for the sake of it.

995
00:59:10,182 --> 00:59:12,550
Speaker 0: Now that covers, you know computers that people have.

996
00:59:12,691 --> 00:59:14,678
Speaker 0: that, you know, they bought and of course most people have.

997
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:15,340
Speaker 0: you buy laptops.

998
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,594
Speaker 0: You don't have to think about this at all.

999
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:21,100
Speaker 1: No laptops You have to go one thing one dust your goddamn laptop and don't cover the fan with anything.

1000
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't put it on your rug or your.

1001
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,637
Speaker 1: get your Afghan and try to use it.

1002
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:27,824
Speaker 0: Yeah It's pretty much it.

1003
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:30,820
Speaker 0: Yes, you know a well-designed laptop is gonna cool itself.

1004
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:34,940
Speaker 0: Don't buy a piece of shit laptop that has problems because there's nothing you can do to fix it.

1005
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,337
Speaker 0: Just don't if you buy a crappy laptop and they designed it poorly you can't fix it because.

1006
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:42,420
Speaker 1: so one last thing.

1007
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,785
Speaker 1: It's more so wasn't for quietness.

1008
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:46,072
Speaker 1: Don't buy a cheap PSU.

1009
00:59:46,152 --> 00:59:48,360
Speaker 1: They're way louder than the better ones.

1010
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:52,299
Speaker 1: Just do your research and find what people say and find the quietest PSU you can find.

1011
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:54,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're you know, the PSU is a fan.

1012
00:59:54,952 --> 00:59:56,760
Speaker 1: It counts as an X an output fan.

1013
00:59:57,202 --> 01:00:02,100
Speaker 1: So if you're designing a case you want positive pressure, don't forget that the PSU is drawing power out of your case.

1014
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:06,060
Speaker 0: Most of the PSUs though have adjustable fan speeds on them nowadays.

1015
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:14,769
Speaker 0: At least all the ones I've bought recently have little knobs to control the plate the power supply fan speed and the motherboard actually has Ways of controlling this the PSU fan speed as well.

1016
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,660
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit as you were alluding to to enterprise cooling.

1017
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:20,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see people need to know this shit.

1018
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:25,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean everyone always, you know thinks about cooling their computer in their house, right?

1019
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what nerds do.

1020
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,413
Speaker 1: Server usually needs to be about 20% cooler, right?

1021
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,140
Speaker 0: But when you've got a you know, it's not just you know a server having a server.

1022
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:40,040
Speaker 0: It's mostly the same as consumer cooling right, but it's all about when you're doing enterprise stuff or at a business.

1023
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:41,200
Speaker 0: You've got racks.

1024
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:58,865
Speaker 0: You've got a lot of servers in the same exact room with not a lot of space between them and it's usually a small room Which means that even though each computer might be designed well for cooling individually The room itself is like a secondary case and that room All the exhaust.

1025
01:00:58,885 --> 01:01:05,224
Speaker 0: the hot exhaust comes out of the computers into that room and into the intakes again and basically The whole room heats up.

1026
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:09,818
Speaker 0: and now you've got a problem because how can you cool something with intake fans that are bringing in air?

1027
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,820
Speaker 0: That is basically almost as hot as the air that's being exhausted and you're fucked now.

1028
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:24,200
Speaker 1: I was very lucky in my career that I started at IBM and I actually very rapidly came to manage a Relatively small raised floor, you know traditional data center.

1029
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:33,360
Speaker 1: So I learned all this stuff a long time ago and the vast majority of data centers you ever run into at least for the foreseeable Future will be exactly as I described.

1030
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:43,540
Speaker 1: So if you're an IT guy or you're just a guy who wants to know about this stuff I'm going to in maybe five or six minutes tell you everything you need to know about cooling data centers.

1031
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,587
Speaker 0: there are conditioners.

1032
01:01:44,728 --> 01:01:49,660
Speaker 1: we can't talk about the Fancy like Facebook's data centers or Google's data.

1033
01:01:50,122 --> 01:01:55,320
Speaker 0: Actually Facebook's data centers are completely open source and you can totally see videos of them and diagrams of them online.

1034
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:01,080
Speaker 0: And if that's your interest go for it, there are very cool upcoming emerging technologies about data center.

1035
01:02:01,146 --> 01:02:15,832
Speaker 0: Yeah basically there are certain plate data centers in the world that are so big and the people running them are so technologically apt that They actually, you know if they can save like one bit of energy It's this because they're so gigantic that saves them a ton of money.

1036
01:02:15,892 --> 01:02:23,920
Speaker 0: So they push the envelope of Efficiency of cooling and power usage in their data centers as far as they can possibly go.

1037
01:02:24,081 --> 01:02:27,500
Speaker 0: But the vast majority of data centers aren't like that, you know.

1038
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,019
Speaker 0: They aren't run by Google or Facebook or someone who's so big.

1039
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:37,000
Speaker 1: So here to make it to make a good analogy for people who might be more code inclined The super future far-out data centers.

1040
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:44,220
Speaker 1: That's the equivalent of writing like a pyramids web app like bleeding-edge brand-new barely documented shit.

1041
01:02:44,863 --> 01:02:55,984
Speaker 1: Most data centers all generally follow the same sort of, you know Tried-and-true best practices of cooling even because the people who run like the level of Django like alright kind of fancy But used in a lot of place.

1042
01:02:56,065 --> 01:03:01,584
Speaker 0: Well, you get Google does stuff like those, you know data center in a Shipping containers.

1043
01:03:01,664 --> 01:03:04,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, which you know what is actually not super out there.

1044
01:03:04,756 --> 01:03:05,720
Speaker 0: It's still pretty fancy.

1045
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:11,460
Speaker 1: It's fancier than normal stuff, but both the vast majority of data centers are alright.

1046
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,868
Speaker 1: You've got Apache running serving up static pages.

1047
01:03:14,189 --> 01:03:14,389
Speaker 0: Yep.

1048
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:17,660
Speaker 1: So you're gonna have a raised floor if you don't have a raised floor.

1049
01:03:17,802 --> 01:03:18,640
Speaker 1: I failed already.

1050
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:23,240
Speaker 0: I really there's a raised floor is basically like the reverse of a drop ceiling, right?

1051
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:31,074
Speaker 0: So, you know a drop ceiling is when you have all these ceiling tiles And if you push a ceiling tile out of the way you go Oh, look, the ceilings actually much higher than the ceiling that I see.

1052
01:03:31,315 --> 01:03:32,620
Speaker 0: there's a ceiling in front of the ceiling.

1053
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, you basically got floor tiles and under that is between one and four feet of space.

1054
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:46,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like there's a floor and you can actually open the floor and then this room under the floor before there's the All the you know other stuff about raised floors.

1055
01:03:46,752 --> 01:03:50,598
Speaker 1: cuz frankly I think we could do a show on raised floor data center man At least I could.

1056
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:55,620
Speaker 0: But as boring as hell we're gonna do a show about floors that are above floor.

1057
01:03:55,841 --> 01:04:02,496
Speaker 1: actually, I got a lot to say because it said These are useful IT skills that people don't fucking know in the real world.

1058
01:04:02,636 --> 01:04:05,004
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Cuz almost no one has a raise.

1059
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,087
Speaker 1: just talk about cooling.

1060
01:04:06,348 --> 01:04:10,560
Speaker 1: you'll have huge units usually that pump cold air under the floor.

1061
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:16,760
Speaker 1: So the floor is kind of fairly highly pressurized cold air just being pumped in high pressure.

1062
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,387
Speaker 1: Yep, and you'll have rows of servers.

1063
01:04:20,948 --> 01:04:25,320
Speaker 1: you spread everything and you break it up into hot aisles and cold aisles.

1064
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,377
Speaker 1: So you've got a rack a line of racks a hundred racks all in a row.

1065
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:29,980
Speaker 0: It's a cold.

1066
01:04:30,563 --> 01:04:32,371
Speaker 1: Well, no, no, no it separates.

1067
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:34,319
Speaker 1: it's basically the wall between two aisles.

1068
01:04:35,144 --> 01:04:44,060
Speaker 1: The servers are all side by side top to bottom in racks The servers and the two aisles that are next to each other the fronts of the servers face each other.

1069
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,020
Speaker 1: so all the fronts of the servers on the left rack are Facing in and all the servers on the right rack are facing in.

1070
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,697
Speaker 1: So if you stand in the middle of this aisle any direction you look you're gonna see the fronts of servers or more aisle.

1071
01:04:56,018 --> 01:05:00,520
Speaker 0: Hmm That's a cold aisle because all the intake fans are on the fronts of the server.

1072
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,224
Speaker 0: So they're all into.

1073
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:04,400
Speaker 0: all the servers are in taking the cold air from the cold aisle.

1074
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:09,399
Speaker 1: So in front of every rack is a floor tile that has holes in it.

1075
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:13,135
Speaker 1: Mmm cold air comes up and the servers suck it in.

1076
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:16,610
Speaker 0: so every other now Why now they think you think why would the cold air go up?

1077
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:18,820
Speaker 0: because cold air sinks and hot air rises?

1078
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,420
Speaker 0: Well, it's because the hot the cold air is pressurized.

1079
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:26,340
Speaker 0: So it's actually being squeezed out of those holes in the floor and being shot up in front of the servers.

1080
01:05:26,662 --> 01:05:29,560
Speaker 1: So the air goes through the servers which are all, you know rack units.

1081
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,320
Speaker 1: So they're long thin servers and the air comes out the back.

1082
01:05:34,382 --> 01:05:39,240
Speaker 1: The next rows are hot aisles the next aisles and all the backs of servers are facing these.

1083
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:49,256
Speaker 1: So all the hot air that has already cooled these servers down and has now the server heat in it comes into those aisles and Goes up because it goes up and away.

1084
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:55,140
Speaker 0: Yep You have vents or some sort of you know drop ceiling with basically the reverse of the cold floor is up there.

1085
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,210
Speaker 0: Maybe you send that air out of the building.

1086
01:05:57,491 --> 01:05:59,220
Speaker 0: Maybe you send it back to an air conditioner.

1087
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:09,391
Speaker 0: It's usually easier to send it out of the building and the air conditioner because it would air conditioner to cool The hot air would be more energy than just cool new outside air Which is already colder than the hot.

1088
01:06:09,411 --> 01:06:11,100
Speaker 0: it, you know, the heated up air from the CPU.

1089
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:24,920
Speaker 1: So when you're building a rack just fill it Just fill it with servers and more importantly any spot in your rack that doesn't have a server Put a faceplate to block kind of like how on your PC You put a faceplate to block those five and a half inch bays that you never use.

1090
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:31,929
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz if you don't put a faceplate to block then some of the cold air from the cold aisle will just shoot straight through the Hot aisle getting completely unused.

1091
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,280
Speaker 1: if you have racks put sides on your racks.

1092
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,997
Speaker 1: Don't put doors on the front that don't let the air in.

1093
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:40,913
Speaker 0: Yeah I've seen those racks with doors and it's like what the fuck.

1094
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:42,080
Speaker 1: every rack has doors.

1095
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:50,480
Speaker 1: but the thing is you have doors where either they have vents in the side where the air gets in or The fronts of the rack are actually over a hole.

1096
01:06:50,862 --> 01:06:54,800
Speaker 1: So there's a door and the cold air is coming up through the inside between the door and the fronts of the server.

1097
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:59,278
Speaker 0: Sometimes though you do want a door because what you'll have is you have a rack unit that doesn't actually have servers.

1098
01:06:59,298 --> 01:06:59,820
Speaker 0: that has like.

1099
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,999
Speaker 0: You know when those little terminal bits or something like, you know.

1100
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,996
Speaker 1: So I could go into all those details, but but you don't leave that for the raised floor.

1101
01:07:06,036 --> 01:07:07,040
Speaker 1: data center management show.

1102
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:07,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's.

1103
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:17,891
Speaker 1: but the key is don't put holes in the hot Put faceplates in your racks.

1104
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:19,820
Speaker 1: fill your racks if possible.

1105
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:23,375
Speaker 1: Don't block the intakes with anything.

1106
01:07:23,395 --> 01:07:26,065
Speaker 1: Yep That's really all there is to it.

1107
01:07:26,366 --> 01:07:29,314
Speaker 1: If the air conditioning unit fails call somebody.

1108
01:07:29,615 --> 01:07:31,440
Speaker 1: don't just let it stay failed.

1109
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:34,080
Speaker 1: Don't turn it off because it's loud.

1110
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wish that wasn't the advice.

1111
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:41,469
Speaker 0: I felt I needed to give yeah, but big big data centers They do things pretty differently.

1112
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:54,010
Speaker 0: like instead of most of what they the advancements You'll see is like instead of using regular old air conditioners and backup regular old air conditioners They'll have some sort of other cooling system You know that pumps the cold air into the cold isle.

1113
01:07:54,091 --> 01:08:05,020
Speaker 0: or they'll have more directed flow like something like, you know They'll use like misters and fans or rulers Yeah, or heat pumps or all sorts of different ways of making the air cold.

1114
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,272
Speaker 0: That's more energy efficient.

1115
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:14,080
Speaker 1: or directed flow Like you have ducks coming up out of the floor that basically direct feed the cold air to the individual servers in your rack.

1116
01:08:14,444 --> 01:08:14,667
Speaker 0: Yep,

1117
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:15,762
Speaker 1: cool things like that a

1118
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:30,828
Speaker 0: lot of people have tried sometimes You know and it's like the aisles won't actually have any air and what they'll do is all the racks will actually be sort of Sealed from all the sides but not the top and the bottom and they'll pump cold air directly into the bottom of the racks Which are sealed right?

1119
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:35,202
Speaker 0: So the cold air doesn't go into the aisle It only goes into the area where the servers are right.

1120
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,089
Speaker 0: and then the cold air is underneath the servers.

1121
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:41,975
Speaker 0: the servers heat it up and it rises out and they'll put the fans on The bottom and the top of the servers instead of in the front.

1122
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:45,059
Speaker 0: in the back All kinds of people try all sorts of weird things.

1123
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:49,520
Speaker 1: So last important thing there too cold is just as bad as too hot.

1124
01:08:49,685 --> 01:08:51,465
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Obviously people don't.

1125
01:08:51,505 --> 01:08:58,395
Speaker 1: a lot of people keep their data centers way colder than they should because if it's too cold One glitch in the humidity and you've got condensation.

1126
01:08:58,435 --> 01:08:59,259
Speaker 1: That's the fucking end.

1127
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:07,357
Speaker 0: Humidity is something, you know, you don't really to think about when you're just you know A normal person with consumer hardware, but humidity in a data center.

1128
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:09,862
Speaker 0: It's like Station.

1129
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:13,640
Speaker 1: if it's too hot overheating if it's too dry static problems.

1130
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:17,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, you know, you're cooling you just your computer.

1131
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,790
Speaker 0: Condensation is probably not gonna become an issue right?

1132
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:26,109
Speaker 0: But if you're cooling a whole room with air conditioners it's very possible that it could.

1133
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:30,479
Speaker 0: basically the whole room is a refrigerator and It can condensate very easily.

1134
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,197
Speaker 0: Any big trouble?

1135
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,537
Speaker 0: Computers and water are not fun.

1136
01:09:41,283 --> 01:09:43,800
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1137
