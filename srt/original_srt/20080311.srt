1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,485
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 11th.

2
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:12,587
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:17,980
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight the side-scrolling beat-em-up games.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:35,090
Speaker 1: You know surprisingly we haven't played brawl at all yet today.

6
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:39,966
Speaker 0: I played it yesterday for a bit and that like subspace emissary thing like.

7
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:40,508
Speaker 0: I'm not.

8
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,763
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm even 20% done with it according to the number in the top right.

9
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,250
Speaker 0: how long does it take to beat goddamn?

10
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,730
Speaker 1: I'm gonna let Scott go through all that and I'm just gonna play normal Smash Brothers.

11
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:52,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, rim can't be trusted to play co-op mode.

12
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:55,550
Speaker 1: I believe the lack of trust here is very simple.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,630
Speaker 1: You see Scott can't be trusted to not suck at the co-op mode.

14
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:00,595
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

15
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:07,183
Speaker 1: I'm sure every time we try to play River City Ransom or something We'll be playing and I'll be doing well and Scott will.

16
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:08,990
Speaker 1: just it's not like he does it on purpose.

17
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,014
Speaker 1: He just lacks.

18
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:12,885
Speaker 1: I guess I don't know skill, but he'll constantly.

19
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,330
Speaker 0: just yeah, I like so much skill.

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,630
Speaker 1: That's why I beat the game on hit me and it'll hurt me and he'll knock me over River City Ransom.

21
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:23,050
Speaker 1: He'll constantly just like hit me with a pipe or knock me with a brass knuckle or something.

22
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,786
Speaker 1: He'll throw a tire at a wall and hits me in the back and kick me.

23
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:28,474
Speaker 1: You'll punch me Punishing you for sucking.

24
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:29,296
Speaker 1: Yeah.

25
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,519
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I'm doing just fine.

26
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,106
Speaker 1: So, uh, you see Scott misses and hits me.

27
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:41,330
Speaker 1: I never miss but Sometimes I hit Scott and that is in retaliation for him not pulling up his end of the bargain.

28
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:45,370
Speaker 1: Boss fights are much easier if I throw Scott off the cliff then beat the boss by myself.

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:55,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure because you know, I can beat River City Ransom just fine on my own, but we're there And gauntlet I can beat just fine on my own except when you're there.

30
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:55,929
Speaker 0: shooting all the food.

31
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:01,230
Speaker 1: Gauntlet one for one is actually a pretty shitty game and that we're not arguing that right now.

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,110
Speaker 0: But do you or do you not shoot all the food in gauntlet does preventing anyone from having a good chance of doing?

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,254
Speaker 1: Well, I think a much more apt example in gauntlet is when as a warrior I push you into every single slime and death We run across.

34
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,104
Speaker 0: see this is exactly what I'm talking about.

35
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:16,626
Speaker 1: That's different.

36
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,330
Speaker 1: No, that's gauntlet.

37
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:18,775
Speaker 0: No, it's all the same.

38
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:22,188
Speaker 0: gauntlet cannot be trusted as a partner in co-op games.

39
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:22,750
Speaker 1: Just gauntlet.

40
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:31,109
Speaker 0: We really want to play co-op games But rim can't seem to play and actually try to win tries to kill all the other players in grief.

41
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,783
Speaker 1: Yet how come whenever we play four swords who gets voted all the way?

42
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,590
Speaker 0: the fuck down because you grieve.

43
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:38,537
Speaker 0: That's all you do.

44
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:40,049
Speaker 0: is you shoot me with the fire rod.

45
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,830
Speaker 1: So then you vote against me, but there's two other people and they're also voting against you.

46
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,485
Speaker 0: So something because you're just all laughing together voting against me, even though I helped the most.

47
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:50,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got the most jimmies.

48
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:52,636
Speaker 1: Everyone is out to get you.

49
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:53,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

50
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,543
Speaker 0: Well, they're not out to get me.

51
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:54,864
Speaker 0: You're just.

52
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:56,129
Speaker 0: you know, it's not like evil.

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,718
Speaker 0: It's like haha funny, but it that's not.

54
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,324
Speaker 0: no like haha funny.

55
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,890
Speaker 0: Let's vote against Scott every time low.

56
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,816
Speaker 1: Oh, we don't do that.

57
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:04,529
Speaker 1: We vote against you because you're a cock.

58
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,315
Speaker 1: Throw us into the water.

59
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:06,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

60
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:11,275
Speaker 0: You know how I'm a cock because the whole time I'm going you morons Why aren't you trying to win?

61
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,984
Speaker 0: Why are you shooting each other with the fire rod?

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,507
Speaker 0: Goddamn it.

63
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,150
Speaker 0: Let's try to win.

64
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:14,796
Speaker 0: Goddamn it.

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,462
Speaker 1: See that's the thing.

66
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:16,751
Speaker 1: There's a Bike.

67
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:18,815
Speaker 1: whenever I do grief, it is very much intentional.

68
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:21,019
Speaker 1: However, in that one mission.

69
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,422
Speaker 1: We have to avoid the searchlights.

70
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:28,450
Speaker 1: I And yelled and yelled at Pete for making a mistake.

71
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,370
Speaker 1: It happens to go back to the beginning and while he was yelling at him Scott just fucking stood there and the searchlight got him.

72
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,498
Speaker 0: Hey, I knew what I think.

73
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:42,430
Speaker 0: basically what the issue was there is that we had got caught by the searchlights, right?

74
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,033
Speaker 0: But then I was.

75
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:50,728
Speaker 0: I didn't realize right away that the reason the searchlights caught us was not because I thought it was just cuz someone Else is stupid and walked into them.

76
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:54,263
Speaker 0: But I didn't realize it was because the smashing of the pots attracts them.

77
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:58,969
Speaker 0: and then so yeah Once I learned that lesson, I did not mess up again.

78
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,900
Speaker 1: Anyway, this isn't really news, but I'll talk about it briefly.

79
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,930
Speaker 1: as you may know Scott and I are going to be at PAX.

80
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:10,570
Speaker 0: We have guaranteed it's a lock barring death or catastrophe.

81
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:19,620
Speaker 0: We will be in Seattle near the end of August for an event of penny arcade Expositioning now exhibitioning.

82
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:26,290
Speaker 1: there is a small chance But not a zero chance that we will be engaged in some sort of events at PAX.

83
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, we we can.

84
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:29,179
Speaker 0: we have no idea.

85
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:34,498
Speaker 0: basically we said please and we're waiting for them to say maybe yeah Pax is kind of different from other cons.

86
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:40,799
Speaker 0: I mean I look at my Congress a little bit a little bit bigger Yeah, a little bit video game a little bit other side of the country.

87
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,946
Speaker 1: Also not quite formatted.

88
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:49,426
Speaker 1: the way anime cons are Can't just run the same kind of panels you're on at these little anime cons as you can.

89
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,330
Speaker 1: is something like packs?

90
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:51,598
Speaker 0: No, not really.

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,289
Speaker 1: But yeah, we're working on it.

92
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,566
Speaker 1: We're gonna try to do some awesome stuff for you guys there and there'll be much more details to come.

93
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,848
Speaker 1: as time goes on We'll find out.

94
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:02,901
Speaker 1: So, uh, what do you got in the news for me?

95
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:06,620
Speaker 0: since I have nothing else today I'm not sure if I did this news on the show before.

96
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,850
Speaker 1: I don't remember you were gonna do it the night.

97
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,130
Speaker 1: We got fucked and stuck in the city and then Emily saved us with the Amtrak.

98
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:15,539
Speaker 0: Well, I don't remember but this is from February 12th.

99
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:20,530
Speaker 0: And if I did this news before oh, well tough shit You'll have to hear it again.

100
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,585
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because this is a news that everyone should read and it's sort of very.

101
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,050
Speaker 0: I think it's really important.

102
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,750
Speaker 0: So it's worth even if I talk about it twice.

103
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,935
Speaker 0: Basically, the story is here.

104
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:37,723
Speaker 0: There's a sort of a casual in quotes, you know I'm not sure how much I'm liking that term now gaming company.

105
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:57,254
Speaker 0: They make video games, right and basically, they realized that like 92% of the people playing the full version of their game online Right because they it was an online game they knew how many people were playing it 92% of the people playing the full version online Had pirated it.

106
00:05:57,474 --> 00:06:00,744
Speaker 1: think about that the that's not even like the majority.

107
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:01,686
Speaker 1: That's not even a lot.

108
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:08,427
Speaker 1: the vast Unmitigated majority of people playing that game had pirated it for free.

109
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:11,054
Speaker 0: That's an Overwhelming amount.

110
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:16,670
Speaker 1: like you could basically say pretty much everyone playing that game was pirating and you would not be exaggerating that much.

111
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,324
Speaker 0: So, what did they do, of course they tried some DRMs, right.

112
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:26,710
Speaker 0: so they Pumped up the DRM and then they looked how many people were playing and they pumped up the DRM.

113
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,669
Speaker 0: They looked how many people were playing right and they sort of kept track the whole time.

114
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:51,059
Speaker 0: now This isn't a very good scientific study You know and it for a real science or whatever because it's only a sample size of one game, you know not too many controls that sort of thing, but Basically if you look at these numbers It's it's pretty obvious that at least for this one game that one about one.

115
00:06:53,194 --> 00:07:01,189
Speaker 0: Okay, let me try to say this properly for every 1000 pirated copies they sort of blocked with DRM.

116
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:03,882
Speaker 0: They got one sale.

117
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:09,650
Speaker 0: So Anyone who's like, oh no you pirated a thousand copies of my thing.

118
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,570
Speaker 0: I lost a thousand times the ticket for the sale price.

119
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:16,581
Speaker 0: no, you lost like one times the sale price for every thousand.

120
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:30,170
Speaker 1: because this brings up a very Interesting issue because in the anime world in the technology world This is becoming a debate and an issue to the point that we could talk about it validly on all four nights of geek night.

121
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, pervading every possible kind of media.

122
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:36,810
Speaker 0: I think that what this shows is something that I had suspected for quite a while.

123
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:47,670
Speaker 0: All right, picture this you're at a carnival right and you're walking down the street Okay, and a guy says hey come in and see the bearded lady one dollar, right?

124
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,410
Speaker 0: Well at the price of one dollar, right?

125
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:57,648
Speaker 0: You know Some people will see the bearded lady and some people will not see the bearded lady at the price of two dollars.

126
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,800
Speaker 0: even fewer People's here to see the bearded lady.

127
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,450
Speaker 0: This is basic economics here.

128
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,830
Speaker 0: Right the higher the price the few people who will pay to see the bearded lady.

129
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:19,877
Speaker 0: Right now the thing is is that there is so much media and so much stuff Right that it's gotten to the point where there are some things in fact most things where you know for free For zero dollars.

130
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:23,590
Speaker 0: just about anyone will at least take a peek at the bearded lady, right?

131
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:32,330
Speaker 0: But once you raise the price to a dollar Like it's like well, I'd like to see the bearded lady, but I don't want to see it that bad that I'll pay money.

132
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:43,570
Speaker 0: You know, it's like if you give something away for free even if it's not that good even if it's kind of a Tons and tons of people check it out because it doesn't cost them any money.

133
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:46,129
Speaker 0: But as soon as there's a price on it, no one wants it.

134
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:53,990
Speaker 0: so the assumption that Someone pirating it would have bought it if it wasn't free if they couldn't pirate it is complete horseshit.

135
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,639
Speaker 0: The only if they give the game wasn't piratable.

136
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,910
Speaker 0: if they couldn't pirate the anime if they couldn't get the fan sub They just wouldn't watch they wouldn't play they wouldn't.

137
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,535
Speaker 0: It's like they.

138
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:10,368
Speaker 0: they like it enough to do it for free, but they don't like it enough to pay anything for it.

139
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:11,332
Speaker 1: now again We're not.

140
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:15,792
Speaker 1: I mean don't read into this in terms of thinking like oh so piracy is okay blah blah blah Cuz.

141
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,550
Speaker 1: it's not what we're saying.

142
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:40,433
Speaker 1: That's not even close to what we're getting it that the point here is just that there's so much media of every possible kind so much Entertainment available in the world today in the modern industrialized world that the cost of a obtaining any given form of entertainment or the I guess the value people are willing to give up the opportunity cause people are willing to expend is Approaching zero.

143
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:41,538
Speaker 1: like look at YouTube.

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,310
Speaker 1: how many people would even consider?

145
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,930
Speaker 1: Going to YouTube if it cost anything to see a video on YouTube?

146
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I'll watch a video of a cat bouncing around for free.

147
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,775
Speaker 0: if it was a dollar known watch it It was a penny.

148
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:56,622
Speaker 1: No one would watch it.

149
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much So we're.

150
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:03,250
Speaker 1: this is an interesting problem because even further you can't compete with the past.

151
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:04,918
Speaker 1: I mean consider.

152
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:20,170
Speaker 1: people always say and I again You know not condoning piracy and this is kind of a sad example, but seriously if you think about this consider Every book every single book that has ever been written in the that's in the English language today.

153
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:32,665
Speaker 1: Now let's say that due to piracy and used book sales No one from this day forward ever Buys a new book again or in any way contributes to the livelihood of an author.

154
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:39,848
Speaker 1: ever ever ever again There are still more good books in existence than any human being could read in their entire life.

155
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:44,507
Speaker 1: Yep Now that's not to say oh, well, therefore we should stop making books.

156
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:45,130
Speaker 1: That's ludicrous.

157
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,741
Speaker 0: That is ludicrous because they're new who?

158
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,910
Speaker 0: this is definitely room for more good.

159
00:10:49,970 --> 00:11:04,964
Speaker 1: but what it's saying is that because of the retention of data in society today and Because of the availability of access to information and across all medium media mediums We're getting to the point where you don't just compete with like.

160
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:11,009
Speaker 1: if I write a novel or I make a video game I'm not just competing with about Scott who wrote a novel or Scott who wrote a video game.

161
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:20,978
Speaker 1: I'm competing directly with every video game maker or every author who has ever existed and That competition gets to them.

162
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:22,664
Speaker 1: I mean think about that.

163
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:23,528
Speaker 1: Think about trying to keep.

164
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:27,640
Speaker 1: there are already Hundreds of thousands of things that are better than anything.

165
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,590
Speaker 1: I will ever do already out there already done.

166
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,698
Speaker 1: A lot of them are already available for free.

167
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:38,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you try to charge money for your new thing It's better be fucking awesome.

168
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:45,117
Speaker 0: or basically people are gonna walk by and you're standing there saying bearded lady five bucks They're just like fuck you man.

169
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,848
Speaker 0: I'd go in there for free, but not for five bucks.

170
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:49,030
Speaker 1: besides There's a stubbly lady over there for nothing.

171
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:55,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you if you if they walk by and you say holy shit Something fucking awesome.

172
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,650
Speaker 0: I can't think of anything right now.

173
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,563
Speaker 0: I don't know vampire cars right vampire car five bucks.

174
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,450
Speaker 0: people go vampire car.

175
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:03,694
Speaker 0: No fucking way.

176
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:04,797
Speaker 0: and they pay five bucks.

177
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:05,861
Speaker 0: cuz it's so awesome.

178
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,165
Speaker 0: So vampire car.

179
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:08,509
Speaker 0: I just tried to think of something awesome.

180
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,413
Speaker 0: Vampires are okay.

181
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:11,416
Speaker 0: Cool cars are cool.

182
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:12,299
Speaker 0: vampire car.

183
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,302
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

184
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's up there with a naked car.

185
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:17,119
Speaker 0: No, it's better than naked car.

186
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,277
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I've already seen a naked car So I'm not gonna pay to see another day.

187
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't want to see.

188
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:26,467
Speaker 1: you paid a Nazi name Naked car, you know if the naked if I hadn't seen the naked car would have been a happier person.

189
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:27,230
Speaker 0: That's true.

190
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,185
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know you.

191
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:34,368
Speaker 0: basically It's getting to the point where if you don't make something, holy shit.

192
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:45,522
Speaker 0: Awesome It's not worth the money of a whole lot of people especially people who are internet connected because it's this isn't just like Oh rimmons got saying this or oh people saying this.

193
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:46,828
Speaker 1: we have evidence.

194
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,210
Speaker 0: now We have a little bit evidence.

195
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,854
Speaker 0: Someone should really do a study along these lines to figure out like, you know Like.

196
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:56,230
Speaker 0: sit people down in front of a like, you know choice.

197
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,660
Speaker 0: This thing is zero dollars.

198
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,370
Speaker 0: This thing is five dollars pick one.

199
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:04,970
Speaker 1: I remember when Napster first got wiped out because Napster kind of suddenly disappeared.

200
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:12,850
Speaker 1: There was a gap between when Napster went down and when non techie normal people could once again get access to peer-to-peer stuff.

201
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:18,725
Speaker 1: Hmm and I'm reasonably certain that CD sales did not increase at all in that time.

202
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:33,190
Speaker 1: Hmm, maybe and Again, I don't know what to do about this that I mean it's one thing to tell the anime industry Look you say piracy is ruining you But if you eliminate it all piracy, you probably wouldn't see a single additional sale than you see now.

203
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,981
Speaker 0: They see a handful of additional maybe five or six maybe seven.

204
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:38,746
Speaker 1: how many people I mean?

205
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:39,970
Speaker 1: how many punk kids are?

206
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:43,820
Speaker 1: Honestly going to pay $20 per DVD for one piece?

207
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:45,127
Speaker 1: if they can't get it free?

208
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:50,286
Speaker 1: instead They'll just watch cat jumping on a trampoline on YouTube or they'll go play the video game.

209
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,129
Speaker 1: They already own.

210
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:52,354
Speaker 1: Yes, they'll go buy them.

211
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,703
Speaker 0: I mean think about this if they couldn't watch it for free.

212
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,389
Speaker 0: They just wouldn't watch.

213
00:13:57,094 --> 00:14:03,210
Speaker 0: If it wasn't zero dollars to see the bearded lady They would just walk right by the bearded lady tent and never see the bearded lady.

214
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:15,716
Speaker 1: I could spend the next five years of my life playing all the amazing Gameboy advance Gameboy PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games that cost a couple dollars each to get But I just never played because I never had time.

215
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:16,338
Speaker 0: Yep.

216
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:19,748
Speaker 1: So that really reduces the incentive to buy a new game.

217
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:20,409
Speaker 1: Yep.

218
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:35,538
Speaker 1: Anyway in other news this is Related to gaming partly in that I know a lot of gamers are fans of this and that that's kind of the demographic they go After and also because it is in and of itself a game Battle BOTS, I'll talk about battle BOTS

219
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:39,110
Speaker 0: talking about the real battle BOTS like that was on TV way back.

220
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,925
Speaker 1: Yeah battle BOTS that show that everyone was really excited about.

221
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,265
Speaker 1: then once it came on Everyone realized how absolutely lame it was.

222
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,010
Speaker 0: That's really old.

223
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,669
Speaker 0: That was that when I was like in high school, right?

224
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:55,064
Speaker 1: the long story short is that they struck a deal with ESPN and It looks like it's going to be on ESPN 2 again.

225
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:59,570
Speaker 0: Well, ESPN 2 is you know full of like trick pool and other stuff like that.

226
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,158
Speaker 1: So trick pool is so much cooler than battle BOTS.

227
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:12,010
Speaker 0: Oh, it definitely is but it's you know, it's not out of the realm for Battle BOTS to also be on the same channel as the trick shot pool, but a lot of people are excited about billiards.

228
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:18,253
Speaker 1: Sorry, but I'm gonna say this This is kind of a sneaky way of getting a review in because this is something that was really big when I was in high school.

229
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:23,827
Speaker 1: battle BOTS is Really dumb and I've never found it entertaining.

230
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,377
Speaker 0: battle BOTS Trademark is really dumb.

231
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:28,645
Speaker 1: Yes robots fighting is amazing.

232
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,070
Speaker 0: robots fighting is awesome.

233
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,210
Speaker 0: The idea of robots fighting is awesome.

234
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,510
Speaker 1: You get all the fun of making bugs fight without the horror of making living beings fight.

235
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,300
Speaker 1: You make mechanical beings fight with rockets easy.

236
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:51,278
Speaker 0: the on paper battle BOTS like the greatest thing ever But in reality the actual show battle BOTS the actual rules the actual game Sport of battle BOTS not cool.

237
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:55,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, did anyone out there actually actually enjoy watching battle BOTS?

238
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,630
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone did especially the later seasons.

239
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,774
Speaker 1: I'm really curious to hear why.

240
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:02,929
Speaker 1: because it was so unentertaining and so slow and so pathetic.

241
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:07,946
Speaker 1: now What I want to whatever I really want to talk about here is how to make battle BOTS.

242
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:08,468
Speaker 1: Awesome.

243
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:08,890
Speaker 1: This is real.

244
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:13,806
Speaker 0: We need a lot fewer rules because they've been way too many limits on the robots.

245
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,170
Speaker 0: They should have let you go hog wild.

246
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:20,011
Speaker 0: I'm talking like Chainsaws guns Pissed.

247
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,641
Speaker 1: no, I understand no projectiles that make sense.

248
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,367
Speaker 0: Oh, come on projectiles for the win.

249
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:31,254
Speaker 1: No, you'll Yeah, but no cuz I don't like that cuz then you got to make all these rules about ammo and all that I don't have.

250
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:38,572
Speaker 0: like like like sort of a helicopter thing with big weights on the end We're just Ram like wham right in the side of you like a big spinning thing I don't know.

251
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:45,924
Speaker 1: I always like the idea of you know, like a like a cattle stunner a captive bolts Mmm, I really like the idea.

252
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:46,690
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

253
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:49,689
Speaker 1: I never saw a battle bot that was cool and battle bots were so lame.

254
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:50,553
Speaker 0: now There are a few.

255
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:53,144
Speaker 0: the best ones are the ones that would scoop.

256
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:54,510
Speaker 0: they were so low to the ground.

257
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:59,470
Speaker 0: They would scoop up under the opposing robot and then they had buzz saws on their top.

258
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:03,005
Speaker 0: So when the opposing robot was on top of them, it would get all cut up.

259
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,190
Speaker 0: Those are the best ones.

260
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:11,455
Speaker 1: I think the real problem with battle bots aside from the restrictive rules was the fact that it was really kind of amateur Backyard whatever now.

261
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, those robots controlled so imprecisely like they would hobble around.

262
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,691
Speaker 0: They weren't like, you know, the controls weren't dead-on They.

263
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,712
Speaker 0: if I was making a robot I would have the controls be so tight That would be.

264
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,940
Speaker 0: I would concentrate on that more than they make.

265
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:32,623
Speaker 0: how many times you'll make robots that had like Swinging attack arms and the arms like miss every time it's like?

266
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:36,208
Speaker 0: or they'd like try to rotate it into position And it wouldn't quite work.

267
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:39,729
Speaker 1: Also the so-called damage zones or whatever.

268
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:41,309
Speaker 1: We're totally lame and weak.

269
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:51,039
Speaker 1: My idea of a damage zone is a plate and above that plate is a hundred pound weight that is smashing down Repeatedly and continuously as hard as it can.

270
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might that might be hard to maintain that weight But even so it's still pretty.

271
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:58,120
Speaker 0: that's that would be much better.

272
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:59,384
Speaker 1: Just something cool.

273
00:17:59,505 --> 00:17:59,886
Speaker 1: I don't know.

274
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:04,090
Speaker 0: pits fire Acid so definitely needs to be fire involved.

275
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:11,330
Speaker 1: The battle bots didn't show enough damage or weren't able to be constructed in such a way as to cause enough damage to be interesting.

276
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:18,310
Speaker 1: Now here is the simplest most obvious solution kick out the kids and the backyard bullshit.

277
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:26,270
Speaker 1: Why don't they have the board engineers at IBM and the free engineers at Lockheed Martin and military contractors?

278
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:29,668
Speaker 1: I'm talking make battle bots f-fucking-1.

279
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:36,950
Speaker 1: I want to see board engineers from IBM making death machines that fight against equally awesome death machines from Lockheed.

280
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,532
Speaker 0: I want them to have to do this shit in the middle of like the desert where no one will get killed because it's so Fucking dangerous.

281
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:46,604
Speaker 0: I see like honestly like six foot tall like freaking.

282
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:47,627
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

283
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,575
Speaker 0: It's a tank on legs I want to see like EMPs.

284
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:51,879
Speaker 1: I want oh, man.

285
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,510
Speaker 1: I want this to be awesome and battle bots is not awesome.

286
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:08,565
Speaker 0: I want to see like a robot that like walks over really quickly like has a Prehensile hands rips the head off the other robot like connects to its internal circuitry Jams the remote control signal makes the other robot turn around and kill.

287
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,770
Speaker 0: It's the person controlling it.

288
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:15,003
Speaker 0: Scratch that last part yeah, but that'd be good in the cartoon though.

289
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,688
Speaker 1: I think you see where I'm going with this.

290
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:26,651
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Anyway, it is time for things of the day.

291
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:27,975
Speaker 0: Oh that wasn't your thing today.

00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:29,260
Speaker 1: No that wasn't my thing of the day.

Speaker 1: ah those books.

298
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,920
Speaker 1: the best part about those books was dying.

299
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:41,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's actually an interview with the guy who created the choose your own adventure books.

300
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,000
Speaker 0: on the comic geek speak podcast.

301
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,280
Speaker 0: They did it a long time ago, but it's a. it's a great interview.

302
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:48,110
Speaker 1: I was glad that everyone read those books the way I did.

303
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,640
Speaker 1: you have like four fingers and four different pages.

304
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:55,920
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, but anyway some guy made a little graph.

305
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:59,973
Speaker 0: You know like like in the computer science sense of the.

306
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:00,936
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure book.

307
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:05,180
Speaker 0: it starts at page one And it's sort of you know it's like okay, then you go to page two.

308
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,244
Speaker 0: It's the only place you can go.

309
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,851
Speaker 0: then three is the only place you can go.

310
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:11,909
Speaker 0: then you go to four or six and he Has every ending labeled.

311
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:24,117
Speaker 0: so it's like there are 121 pages 36 endings 12 full page illustrations one start page 44 choices 33 continuing pages, which are just pages that say turn.

312
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:24,960
Speaker 0: you know go to the next page.

313
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,595
Speaker 0: And some of these endings you can look and they're.

314
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,925
Speaker 0: they're pretty funny And they're really good.

315
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:36,586
Speaker 0: endings are really far away from the start and the thing that really gets Makes me laugh.

316
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:38,816
Speaker 0: the most is on page 113. you have a choice.

317
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:47,025
Speaker 0: It will either send you to page 120 or 121. page 120 Cousins rich.

318
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:48,109
Speaker 0: that's the ending.

319
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:49,053
Speaker 0: page 121 rich.

320
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,370
Speaker 0: It's like on the final page.

321
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,819
Speaker 0: you choose between your rich and your cousins are rich.

322
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,883
Speaker 0: I Think Man, I have so many.

323
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:09,810
Speaker 0: this is the same book where the ending could be free ghost or which dies I remember one Or die in tomb Where you get captured.

324
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:10,835
Speaker 1: it's like at this one end.

325
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:13,344
Speaker 1: if it would choose your own adventure It was and it's pretty much.

326
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,677
Speaker 1: you spend the rest of your life in the prison planet, and then it's like the end.

327
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:23,800
Speaker 1: or If you want to try and escape go to page whatever and on page whatever you fucking get shot to death.

328
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:25,851
Speaker 0: Here's another funny one from this book.

329
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:26,072
Speaker 0: at.

330
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:31,666
Speaker 0: the book is oh by the way the book He made a graph of is the mystery of chimney rock On page one.

331
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:34,077
Speaker 1: I remember that one is page one.

332
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:35,342
Speaker 0: oh something I can't tell.

333
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,626
Speaker 0: right and a page one.

334
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:37,128
Speaker 0: oh something.

335
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:41,120
Speaker 0: you have a choice you can either look back or don't look back.

336
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,326
Speaker 1: You don't want to look back.

337
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:47,300
Speaker 0: if you don't look back it sends you to the page You're currently on and you just repeat the page.

338
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:49,284
Speaker 0: Look back you die.

339
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:50,708
Speaker 0: so basically don't look back.

340
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:51,189
Speaker 0: Don't look back.

341
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:51,691
Speaker 0: Don't look back.

342
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:52,152
Speaker 0: Don't look back.

343
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:53,596
Speaker 0: eventually you look back you die.

344
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:57,395
Speaker 1: ah Man someone needs to revitalize and bring back.

345
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,180
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure.

346
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,733
Speaker 0: But they are the guy who may originally made them is doing it.

347
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:01,960
Speaker 1: where I never see this?

348
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,724
Speaker 0: They're in the store.

349
00:22:02,784 --> 00:22:03,347
Speaker 0: go to borders.

350
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,512
Speaker 0: They want to go to Amazon search.

351
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,236
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure.

352
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:05,960
Speaker 1: You're all man.

353
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,049
Speaker 0: Oh, man, you're gonna buy some kitty books.

354
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:16,075
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna do a Thursday or yeah All right, well you know get on that anyway, so uh you might have seen this video.

355
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:17,860
Speaker 1: this video is on college humor.

356
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,725
Speaker 1: It's on YouTube.

357
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:19,450
Speaker 1: It's on dig.

358
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,978
Speaker 1: It's all over the place, but It's all set the scene for you.

359
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:38,004
Speaker 1: You know when you're a kid in elementary school or preschool you play the parachute game Where everyone stands around a parachute you wave it up and down with balls in the middle and then at the end like the big Finale y'all go up, and then you get inside and you pull it down, and then you're all inside the parachute And it's super cool.

360
00:22:38,486 --> 00:22:41,580
Speaker 0: Oh the big giant parachute in elementary school is way awesome.

361
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,920
Speaker 1: I remember I'd always like leave a crack behind me and try to make it collapse on everyone before we got out.

362
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:51,559
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but anyway all right That's awesome for little kids, and I could even enjoy doing that once or twice now.

363
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:53,825
Speaker 1: So the scene is.

364
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:55,489
Speaker 1: we're at a college campus.

365
00:22:56,191 --> 00:23:01,947
Speaker 1: in the distance to the right is a group of parents and prospective Students getting a tour of the campus.

366
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,305
Speaker 1: our our protagonists in the window are narrating They're obviously high.

367
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:09,111
Speaker 1: They're way high here.

368
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:09,853
Speaker 1: I'm coughing.

369
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,419
Speaker 0: They are test owned.

370
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,059
Speaker 1: however They're that cool college kind of stone not that dammit Duane kind of stone, and it's still stone now.

371
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,640
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that stone is awesome But there's a difference between the cool stone guy who you just kind of go hey to and walk away and dammit Duane.

372
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:33,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is and now fast move forward a bit and in the center of the screen There's a parachute, and they're obviously a bunch of people playing the parachute game.

373
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:40,440
Speaker 0: inside the parachute This is a bunch of people sitting in it And it's sort of full of air and it's kind of moving around like a little colorful mushroom on the ground.

374
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:45,680
Speaker 1: Standing outside of the parachute is a police officer or perhaps a campus security guy?

375
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,342
Speaker 0: We can't tell.

376
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:48,089
Speaker 1: it looks like an actual police officer.

377
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:48,370
Speaker 1: again.

378
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:51,080
Speaker 1: RIT's campus safety looked like actual police officers.

379
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, they sure did.

380
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:58,800
Speaker 1: of course up when they got hit with that bottle They left and then the real police officers came followed by the riot police.

381
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,807
Speaker 1: They sure did told that story didn't we?

382
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:01,891
Speaker 0: I'm sure we must have.

383
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:06,906
Speaker 1: ah if we didn't we were involved in a riot once And we got no riot.

384
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:08,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, not not much of a riot.

385
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,794
Speaker 1: I got pepper-balled.

386
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:10,696
Speaker 1: It wasn't cool.

387
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,983
Speaker 1: Well indirectly yes It wasn't cool.

388
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:13,906
Speaker 0: No it wasn't cool.

389
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:17,218
Speaker 1: I imagine directly is that times a million, and I imagine it's sucking.

390
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:24,145
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, something like that, but uh so in that parachute there are 20 Maybe 25 people.

391
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,482
Speaker 1: now What are they doing?

392
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:27,727
Speaker 1: their hotboxing?

393
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:31,740
Speaker 1: hotboxing is a term for smoking weed in a group in an enclosed space?

394
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,199
Speaker 0: I was not aware of this until just now.

395
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:42,696
Speaker 1: Now that is probably the most efficient way to smoke your drug of choice And I imagine so because you're all the secondary smoke here.

396
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:43,480
Speaker 0: You're saving it up.

397
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:46,570
Speaker 0: You know you you can keep inhaling it even when you're not.

398
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,814
Speaker 0: you know smoking directly.

399
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:51,505
Speaker 0: if you're passing something around you know You're always getting some.

400
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:52,227
Speaker 0: it's not bad.

401
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:58,584
Speaker 1: and also imagine the atmosphere if you even if you think marijuana like you're against drugs And that sort of thing and you know whatever.

402
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:01,151
Speaker 1: imagine the people in that balloon.

403
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,004
Speaker 1: They're probably have you yeah parachute Yeah, in a balloon.

404
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:05,907
Speaker 1: not such a good idea.

405
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:06,309
Speaker 0: No.

406
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,820
Speaker 1: They're probably having it a freaking good time.

407
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:12,334
Speaker 1: I imagine that being a chaotic and wonderful environment in there.

408
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:15,084
Speaker 1: if you're into that sort of thing I mean think about that.

409
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:20,480
Speaker 1: you got the thrill of doing it in public out in the open with a whole bunch of people.

410
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:26,115
Speaker 1: You're also playing the parachute game, which is finding it up itself, and you're stoned which makes everything.

411
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:30,710
Speaker 1: That's fun a Thousand times more fun even if it's not fun to begin with.

412
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,355
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much so.

413
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:33,198
Speaker 0: supposedly so.

414
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:44,217
Speaker 1: the campus the campus safety or police officer obviously knows what's going on and Benny hilarity ensues.

415
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:52,350
Speaker 1: I got something to say about that because someone put the Benny Hill aka Yakety-sacks over the end of this.

416
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,340
Speaker 0: yeah people call this song like the Benny Hill song.

417
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,334
Speaker 0: No, the song is called yakety-sacks.

418
00:25:57,394 --> 00:26:07,942
Speaker 1: get it right Benny Hill is just someone up and to use the realize that there are probably three tiers of people out there And I think that the tier that Scott and I are in or the minority by far I don't know I don't.

419
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:12,580
Speaker 0: I think the first group is the minority the people who actually saw Benny Hill back in the day.

420
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,285
Speaker 1: That's well.

421
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,320
Speaker 1: I've saw Benny Hill every day as a kid.

422
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,562
Speaker 1: No I didn't it was.

423
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:26,271
Speaker 1: I'd come home from school right in middle school and every day on TV as I came home was Monty Python's Flying Circus two episodes of it and then Benny Hill.

424
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:28,578
Speaker 0: we did not have the luxury of that.

425
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,094
Speaker 1: yeah Well I had Canadian TV, and let me tell you what Canadian TV is.

426
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:33,460
Speaker 1: American TV times a thousand.

427
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,063
Speaker 0: Yeah But not that.

428
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,070
Speaker 0: so there's people who actually know the fuck.

429
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,093
Speaker 0: Benny Hill is right.

430
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:39,999
Speaker 0: then there's people like me.

431
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:52,491
Speaker 0: We're come home from school, and I watch cartoons, but in the middle of those cartoons They'd be commercials from local cable television trying to sell like CD Compilations like you know pure funk and whatnot?

432
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,840
Speaker 0: actually pure funks not bad, but I have it.

433
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,880
Speaker 0: But they also tried to sell like Benny Hill VHS tapes and DVDs.

434
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:06,386
Speaker 0: They would always play that song and a lot of people you know all they know of Benny Hill is that commercial.

435
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,272
Speaker 0: that but everyone must have seen.

436
00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:10,660
Speaker 1: but then I realized that there's probably a third tier.

437
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,580
Speaker 1: And these are the people who only know of this through parody.

438
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:20,964
Speaker 1: they've seen Family Guy's and Simpsons and YouTube videos making fun of this and Parodying it and they've seen

439
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:27,586
Speaker 0: everyone using this song in all sorts of videos and other places and saying Benny Hill in Association with the song

440
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,860
Speaker 1: and they probably don't even know who Benny Hill is granted.

441
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,746
Speaker 1: I'll admit I didn't find Benny Hill bad funny.

442
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:31,906
Speaker 0: No.

443
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:32,789
Speaker 0: He's not that funny.

444
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,916
Speaker 1: He's no Monty pythons flying.

445
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:36,280
Speaker 1: some Monty pythons fly.

446
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:43,440
Speaker 0: He's just sort of a classic generic slapstick kind of ha ha funny guy, but he's not super funny.

447
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,140
Speaker 0: But he's worthy of respect.

448
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:48,520
Speaker 0: And you shouldn't be going around saying Benny Hill if you don't know who the hell it is.

449
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,480
Speaker 1: Let me say this the sheer number of stoners who escaped from that parachute is epic.

450
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,715
Speaker 0: The cops should have gotten some backup to surround the parachute.

451
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,140
Speaker 0: then it would have been even more hilarious.

452
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:00,789
Speaker 1: He should have just opened fire.

453
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:01,372
Speaker 0: I don't know.

454
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:02,779
Speaker 0: I don't think he can do that.

455
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,131
Speaker 1: He could have just said we've got you surrounded.

456
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:05,774
Speaker 1: Nobody move.

457
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:09,325
Speaker 0: He could have tased them, bro Don't tase them bro.

458
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:10,992
Speaker 0: Hey, just taste the whole balloons.

459
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:12,839
Speaker 1: All right, so what do you got for me?

460
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,087
Speaker 0: What do I have?

461
00:28:15,449 --> 00:28:18,720
Speaker 1: Oh, oh no thing of the day Did you forget?

462
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:26,408
Speaker 1: No, I sent the link to you and then I sort of did you get so caught up in my thing of the day That you forgot your own thing of the day.

463
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:27,954
Speaker 0: No, I already used my thing.

464
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:29,320
Speaker 0: There's choose your own adventure graph.

465
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:30,567
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was nevermind.

466
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:31,191
Speaker 0: Dumbass.

467
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:31,633
Speaker 0: I'm dumb.

468
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,679
Speaker 0: That's why you're confusing me.

469
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,966
Speaker 1: So, uh, I have a memory.

470
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:45,220
Speaker 1: this memory is of being at Cedar Point when I was a kid a very young kid and Cedar Point, I don't know if it's still there but for much of my childhood, I think Cedar Point is still there.

471
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:46,229
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.

472
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:53,640
Speaker 1: this thing at Cedar Point All right Because in Cedar Point was an arcade a massive arcade and half of this arcade had new games.

473
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:59,960
Speaker 1: But half of the arcade had basically Katsu Kans video gaming room times a thousand.

474
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:03,252
Speaker 1: They had every old arcade cabinet ever man.

475
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:05,180
Speaker 0: I remember when there were big arcades like that.

476
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:12,297
Speaker 1: Those are the days like as much as I love roller coasters I would spend like half a day in this arcade at Cedar Point.

477
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:23,923
Speaker 1: every year You want to go to New Hampshire and go to the the fun spot we should but honestly if it's still there the arcade at Cedar Point with the classic arcade games was like the best fucking arcade I've ever been into.

478
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:28,780
Speaker 0: my sesame street also has a very impressive arcade but fun spot is by far the number one arcade.

479
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,684
Speaker 0: There is no question.

480
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:42,280
Speaker 1: But uh, anyway, I remember a time in my life I was young and you know when you're out with your parents on a vacation you often don't get to Slip away and hang out with nerdy geeks or people are into the things you're into.

481
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:50,060
Speaker 1: Well at one point I remember I saw these like four punk kids play and they were about my age a little older.

482
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:58,799
Speaker 1: you know hip and cool kids and they were playing the Simpsons arcade game and They had been playing it for a while and I remember two of them left.

483
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:13,020
Speaker 1: so I walked over with my mom and we started playing with them and I learned at that moment that Anyone can be friends with anyone if standing in front of and playing a walk sideways beat-em-up in an arcade.

484
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:20,720
Speaker 1: Let me tell you the level of camaraderie in that game was was to the point that it has rarely been duplicated in my life.

485
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,745
Speaker 0: Let me tell you it was.

486
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:28,074
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's my birthday party or someone else's but it was at the you know Somewhat relatively local arcade type place.

487
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:37,430
Speaker 0: and you know If you're at someone's birthday party you get a cup full of fucking tokens and they had you know The six-seat x-men machine with the two monitors.

488
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,556
Speaker 1: Oh man, and nothing moves the blob.

489
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:40,800
Speaker 1: Nothing moves the blob.

490
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,048
Speaker 0: That thing we rocked it.

491
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:51,400
Speaker 0: I brought it from the start and you know other kids switched in and out but I was Cyclops from beginning to end, baby That was some good time.

492
00:30:51,420 --> 00:31:06,259
Speaker 1: There's something about those walk sideways co-op beat-em-up games where especially in the arcade Even though really it was just an exercise in pumping quarters in until you win and skill would basically Reduce the number of quarters somewhat but not as much as you'd think.

493
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:07,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty well.

494
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,880
Speaker 0: I mean cuz you could only get like your power so many times which you clear out the screen, right?

495
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:21,855
Speaker 0: So you could sort of work together all about Colossus and it would be like, okay on this screen We can beat up the guys with our normal powers or death screen.

496
00:31:21,895 --> 00:31:23,140
Speaker 0: We can beat up our guys our own powers.

497
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,988
Speaker 0: Okay, we're not gonna beat this screen.

498
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:27,720
Speaker 0: unless someone uses a power you use the power.

499
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:34,980
Speaker 1: Okay, you know people just know in common sense like how to fight the boss jump strike jump away jump strike jump away stand back.

500
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,565
Speaker 1: Well, he does well.

501
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,399
Speaker 0: Ninja Turtles was all about that.

502
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:47,748
Speaker 0: we would think cuz you had the jump kick the jump slash and the regular slashes and you had to mix them up just Properly and you could actually Ninja Turtles had some I guess Minor amounts of skill to it.

503
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:53,080
Speaker 0: if you knew how to fight each kind of guy without getting hit You could get really far without putting in too many quarters.

504
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,281
Speaker 0: But

505
00:31:53,301 --> 00:32:16,210
Speaker 1: there is definitely something about the formula of those arcade beat-em-ups where even though the skill didn't matter so much it was just a matter of basically pumping in cool in order to be cool and still be there with everyone, but the for some reason these games Fostered this sense of friendship and you get really into it and it would always become like this epic quest like hey guys Wanna fucking beat the Simpsons?

506
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's go want to beat Dungeons & Dragons.

507
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,704
Speaker 0: Dungeons & Dragons one.

508
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:21,487
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

509
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:22,008
Speaker 0: Golden Axe.

510
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:25,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now yeah, basically the beat the side-scrolling beat-em-up.

511
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:45,329
Speaker 0: I mean there were co-op games before but the side-scrolling beat-em-up is the original co-op Genre as far as I'm concerned, you know, I mean you look those are the first games where people are like, okay We're in this together, you know, you take the right you take the left you do this you do that you use your power I'll use mine, etc.

512
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:45,550
Speaker 0: Etc.

513
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,408
Speaker 1: Now, of course arcade non arcade Regardless far and away.

514
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:53,112
Speaker 1: I think the best one of these ever is River City Ransom But that deserves a show in and of itself.

515
00:32:53,132 --> 00:32:54,320
Speaker 1: So we're not even gonna talk about it.

516
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,685
Speaker 0: Well, we can talk about a little bit.

517
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:56,809
Speaker 1: I just fucking awesome.

518
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,723
Speaker 0: River City Ransom was great was better than other Games.

519
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:07,886
Speaker 0: even it was way ahead of its time because unlike other side-scrolling beat-em-ups River City Ransom The items actually worked properly.

520
00:33:08,026 --> 00:33:09,430
Speaker 1: It was somewhat nonlinear.

521
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:13,040
Speaker 0: It had RPG elements of getting money and buying shit.

522
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,116
Speaker 1: It was really funny.

523
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:20,055
Speaker 0: You could actually go anywhere you wanted instead of just continually going right beating up the bad guys.

524
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,299
Speaker 0: go right beat up the bad guys.

525
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,317
Speaker 0: it was actually really complex for the NES.

526
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:28,509
Speaker 1: and Yeah, if ever a game the music is awesome.

527
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:35,348
Speaker 1: ever a game has been in such dire need of a proper Perfectly making the dodgeball in the DS.

528
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,275
Speaker 0: They gotta bring back the River City Ransom.

529
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:38,840
Speaker 1: Oh god, super dodgeball.

530
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:40,004
Speaker 0: It's not a beat-em-up.

531
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:40,868
Speaker 0: You can't talk about it.

532
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:43,999
Speaker 1: It's one of my favorite games in any medium ever.

533
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:49,886
Speaker 0: Okay, oh that game You know the Ninja Turtles one.

534
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:54,060
Speaker 0: I'll go talk about that because this turtles game in the arcade it was pretty awesome.

535
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,175
Speaker 0: It's one of those arcade games that you know, it works so well.

536
00:33:57,195 --> 00:34:00,360
Speaker 0: cuz you know for turtles No, it makes sense for joysticks.

537
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,664
Speaker 0: Hey, you know it was.

538
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:04,333
Speaker 1: you fight the bebop you spider you fight the rock steady.

539
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:07,483
Speaker 0: for a large portion of my childhood That was in.

540
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:11,297
Speaker 0: that was pretty much the game that was in every arcade and it was just like the cartoon.

541
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:16,114
Speaker 0: and this is Of time where the arcade was superior to the home console.

542
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,920
Speaker 1: people would always talk like man.

543
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,080
Speaker 1: Imagine if you could have arcade graphics at home and that was why the Neo Geo was so legendary among kids.

544
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,164
Speaker 1: But no one actually had it.

545
00:34:24,324 --> 00:34:31,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing was is I had the Ninja Turtles to Arcade edition for the NES and it was almost as good.

546
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:33,630
Speaker 0: It was almost as good as the original.

547
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,980
Speaker 0: you had all the same moves.

548
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,760
Speaker 0: There are actually two additional levels in the game.

549
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:43,339
Speaker 0: The only things that were different was that it was you could actually sort of get to the end of the game with.

550
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,449
Speaker 0: you know The number, you know lives they gave you.

551
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,820
Speaker 0: you could beat the game and without spending any money.

552
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:52,431
Speaker 0: well, except for the $50 to buy it and This the music was a little worse.

553
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:53,719
Speaker 0: The graphics were a little worse.

554
00:34:54,422 --> 00:35:01,760
Speaker 0: But and and the one part that I think was the most Disappointing was that they took out the part of the game where you fight bebop and rock steady at the same time.

555
00:35:02,346 --> 00:35:10,480
Speaker 0: That was a good part of the game Yeah, but they added in other parts like riding the skateboards and fighting the wolf guy and the level with the Tigers.

556
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:11,902
Speaker 0: Yeah.

557
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:12,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a good one.

558
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,912
Speaker 1: I think my favorite of the arcade ones.

559
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:17,440
Speaker 1: However, I mean X-Men has a special place in my heart.

560
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,624
Speaker 1: I was always colossus.

561
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:21,234
Speaker 0: Well, it's unlike Simpsons Ninja Turtles.

562
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:24,420
Speaker 0: I think those games are all in the same engine Although I don't want to look it up right now.

563
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,285
Speaker 1: They feel like they were.

564
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:34,300
Speaker 0: they feel like they were the same engine with different graphics on them But the X-Men had the six players which really and it was at the height of the popularity of X-Men that helped it a lot.

565
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was like cartoon X-Men.

566
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:37,309
Speaker 1: That's my.

567
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:38,071
Speaker 1: that's the only X-Men.

568
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:39,054
Speaker 1: I really really like.

569
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:39,596
Speaker 0: Yeah.

570
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:40,197
Speaker 0: Yeah.

571
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:46,300
Speaker 1: Ah But those were good games, but I think my favorite arcade walk sideways beat him up will always be Final Fight.

572
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:48,305
Speaker 0: Final Fight was in the arcade.

573
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,775
Speaker 0: Final Fight was like an NES SNES game.

574
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,160
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's an arcade version.

575
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,948
Speaker 0: I've never played an arcade Final Fight.

576
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,355
Speaker 1: Anyway, what's your favorite game?

577
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,219
Speaker 1: and I'll look that shit up.

578
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,359
Speaker 0: Let's see streets of see streets of rage.

579
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:07,280
Speaker 0: There's like a whole series of streets of rage and you know, I think streets of rage 2 might be the best Or at least my most favorite.

580
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:10,009
Speaker 0: But all the streets of rages are kind of good because it.

581
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,420
Speaker 0: the thing about those is that you had this choice of characters.

582
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:17,987
Speaker 0: I liked all the characters but blaze was actually pretty hot One of the first characters.

583
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:19,595
Speaker 0: when you're like, you know a 13 year old.

584
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:26,792
Speaker 0: in those days You try to be like doing a jump kick so you can see more leg action Released in the arcade in January of 1990.

585
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:27,093
Speaker 1: Wow.

586
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:28,880
Speaker 0: I have never seen a final fight.

587
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:30,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

588
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:37,060
Speaker 0: I have seen that we we'd be sinful not to mention the double dragons Because I will talk about double dragon in a second.

589
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:46,296
Speaker 1: Yeah But I gotta say there was nothing in my childhood more satisfying than as Hagar Taking a guy shoving his face into my butt and crushing him.

590
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:57,720
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean in streets of rage you would you know grab on to someone's head flip over them flip back over them Just infinitely because it was fun then push another button and throw them across the screen at other guys who would then get hit.

591
00:36:58,045 --> 00:36:58,699
Speaker 0: That was good times.

592
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:02,500
Speaker 0: And also the streets of rage had the good weapons as well.

593
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,596
Speaker 0: See it like a. Nintendo had all the final fights and Genesis had all the streets of rages and it was there.

594
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:11,467
Speaker 0: basically, you know Technically mostly the same kind of game.

595
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:13,713
Speaker 0: neither one was technically superior to the other.

596
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:16,280
Speaker 0: they just had different characters different settings.

597
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,688
Speaker 0: You know, I guess streets of rage.

598
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:27,978
Speaker 0: you had to sort of push the button in the cop car shoots a missile at the screen action, but Final fight had the push a button and you sort of throw a fireball which kills all the guys.

599
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:29,544
Speaker 1: action I remember in.

600
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:34,340
Speaker 1: uh, I think there was a. I think it was streets of rage on the Sega Game Gear.

601
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,933
Speaker 0: Yeah, there probably was not a great game.

602
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:49,683
Speaker 0: I had it No, but you know that the thing is these beat-em-up games are largely dead With kind of good reason, I mean I remember I played some sort of 3d beat-em-up ish game on the ps1.

603
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:54,748
Speaker 0: we're like you'd walk around these like Small 3d areas beating guys up.

604
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:57,518
Speaker 0: It was kind of a you know, and I don't you know.

605
00:37:57,578 --> 00:38:01,794
Speaker 0: since then I think there's like been games like God hand and whatever but not too many.

606
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:03,119
Speaker 0: beat-em-up is sort of a.

607
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:06,240
Speaker 1: well They I think it's more that they're not super popular.

608
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:17,000
Speaker 0: No, not really Even though I think if they were brought back properly they would be super popular like River City Ransom could still do really well if you just You know like streets of rage probably wouldn't do that.

609
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:28,439
Speaker 0: Well today because it's pretty much walk sideways push B occasionally push a right but River City Ransom where you got weapons that actually work Smartly and such I think that that would be really popular.

610
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:32,317
Speaker 1: now You know, it also would probably work really really well, but it would take some doing.

611
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:36,814
Speaker 1: this is one of those you know pie in the sky ideas and this is also when I say MMO.

612
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,753
Speaker 1: Ignore everything bullshit, you know about MMOs.

613
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:48,820
Speaker 1: MMO does not mean Wow It does not mean MMO RPG, but imagine a massively multiplayer online River City Ransom or equivalent.

614
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,349
Speaker 0: Isn't that basically with that city of heroes is supposed to be?

615
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:56,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it could have been done so much better and I Have a lot to say about that.

616
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:57,092
Speaker 0: I've never played it.

617
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:58,560
Speaker 0: So I don't know but that's what I've you know.

618
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,725
Speaker 0: That's what people basically said.

619
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:02,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think superhero 3d beat-em-up MMO.

620
00:39:03,261 --> 00:39:10,468
Speaker 1: I think it could have been executed a lot better and with a lot less of the I don't know bad Trappings of most MMO games today.

621
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:18,301
Speaker 0: Yeah, see the thing is after you know The super early beat-em-ups right you being rigid double dragon was like, you know the game That's.

622
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:20,451
Speaker 0: I don't know if that was the first one but I was the first one.

623
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,200
Speaker 0: that sort of got was all about the elbow.

624
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:26,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem with double dragon right is double dragon - great game.

625
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:28,520
Speaker 1: double dragon 3 one of the worst fucking games ever.

626
00:39:29,102 --> 00:39:32,093
Speaker 0: Not just not that but it's that double dragon as a whole.

627
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:33,980
Speaker 0: the controls really were not good.

628
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,640
Speaker 0: You'd like push one button to attack to the right and another button to attack to the left and that was sort of like.

629
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,796
Speaker 0: It just didn't work out very well at all.

630
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:42,520
Speaker 1: a lot of game.

631
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:56,183
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is there's a lot of these games came out in the early days when controls weren't fully standardized yet and people I mean Renegade I remember like depending which direction you were facing different buttons did different things and it was just so Confusing.

632
00:39:56,785 --> 00:40:01,420
Speaker 0: yeah, but double dragon, you know, it's a classic and double dragon - is probably the best of the bunch.

633
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:03,420
Speaker 0: But the controls can be quite annoying.

634
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:09,659
Speaker 0: I mean It's not obvious how to do the jump spinning kick But it's pretty much necessary to be able to do it on command in order to win.

635
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,006
Speaker 1: Well double dragon 3.

636
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:13,560
Speaker 1: I think we can watch the angry video game nerd about that bullshit.

637
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:14,485
Speaker 0: You sure can.

638
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,520
Speaker 0: but you know when double dragon sort of later.

639
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,491
Speaker 0: You know later double dragon games like they made it into a fight a stupid fighting game and then a stupid cartoon based on The stupid fighting game.

640
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:28,219
Speaker 0: and you know That's when it stopped being a beat-em-up and that's when the final fights in the streets of rages came in.

641
00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:34,640
Speaker 1: Pretty much though I mean if you've never played one of these games before don't like go out and play them by yourself because they're not fun.

642
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:37,880
Speaker 1: You really need to play these games with someone.

643
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:53,500
Speaker 1: so if you're ever at an arcade with your friends some sort of classic arcade somewhere and You see a Simpsons arcade machine Grab three friends and just decide you're going to beat it and you will probably have a good time Even though the game itself from a technical level is not that good.

644
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:00,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Simpsons one actually is a very good choice, you know Because I imagine two people who have never played a beat-em-up like trying to play streets of rage.

645
00:41:01,216 --> 00:41:02,200
Speaker 0: It might get kind of boring.

646
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,324
Speaker 0: It's pretty much like okay.

647
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:04,427
Speaker 0: We're beating up different guys.

648
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:06,013
Speaker 0: Here's the guys with different hair color.

649
00:41:06,554 --> 00:41:08,160
Speaker 0: Okay, now we're beating up a fat guy.

650
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:10,253
Speaker 0: Okay, now we're beating up a bartender.

651
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:13,900
Speaker 0: It's like alright, come on And then at the end of the game you beat up a businessman with a gun.

652
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:15,439
Speaker 0: Oh my god a gun, right?

653
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:26,040
Speaker 0: But the Simpsons actually has all sorts of Simpsons shit going on all over the place and it's actually you know The stuff that's on screen while the game itself is just a beat-em-up.

654
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:30,600
Speaker 0: The stuff on screen can be very entertaining if you're a Simpsons fan at all.

655
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,719
Speaker 1: I played that game with my parents more than once and they enjoyed it.

656
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,833
Speaker 0: Yeah just like the Ninja Turtles one is only really entertaining if you're a ninja.

657
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:44,980
Speaker 0: if you know something about Ninja Turtles at least the Cartoon and you're a fan then that game will really really work for you because you'll see all kinds of stuff.

658
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,528
Speaker 0: Be like, oh man, look at that.

659
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:46,930
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

660
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,452
Speaker 0: Look at that.

661
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:48,980
Speaker 1: Is that all we have to say?

662
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,140
Speaker 0: I don't know you got any thing to say about beat-em-ups not terribly I mean.

663
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,068
Speaker 1: it seems like it's kind of like when we played Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

664
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:08,496
Speaker 1: beat-em-ups as they have pretty much always been implemented with the possible exception of River City Ransom are Primarily games of the experience and by the experience, I mean the experience of playing them with someone else.

665
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:10,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not much I mean.

666
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:19,700
Speaker 0: some of them can be really hard and some of them can have sort of complex Near fighting game level, but you know, you're not gonna have fun playing the x-men arcade game all the way through by yourself.

667
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:21,270
Speaker 0: No, not too much.

668
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:23,382
Speaker 0: It's pretty much Walk.

669
00:42:23,522 --> 00:42:29,500
Speaker 0: hold to the right whenever a bad guy gets near you tap the button repeatedly and remember that nothing moves the blob.

670
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:36,359
Speaker 0: Pretty much anyone moves the blob very easily just by hitting it.

671
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:45,992
