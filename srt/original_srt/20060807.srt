4
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,189
Speaker 2: We have some guest hosts for the show.

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,063
Speaker 2: Yes, we were just at Otacon.

6
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:22,170
Speaker 2: it ended yesterday Which means we are not going to be able to make a podcast today.

7
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:26,570
Speaker 2: So we are in fact currently sleeping on the beach somewhere in Wildwood, New Jersey.

8
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:30,129
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you're in Wildwood, New Jersey feel free to come find us.

9
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,330
Speaker 2: We'll be here for a few more days but regardless.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:47,970
Speaker 2: Previously we offered anyone who had the ability to podcast the opportunity to create their very own geek nights episode and We had some takers our friends over at simply syndicated who made from the movies.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,827
Speaker 2: You should see podcast which we have appeared on twice.

12
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:59,130
Speaker 2: yes They like our show so much that they decided to make their own episode of it And this is what you will be hearing very shortly.

13
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:05,866
Speaker 2: So first off if you are a new listener to geek nights You may or may not have found us through Otacon and all of the shows and events we did there.

15
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:19,770
Speaker 2: if you want to listen to a more standard Normal episode look for any episode that doesn't have the word special in the title.

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,507
Speaker 2: There are about a hundred and sixty of them out there either in iTunes or on the feed or on the website itself.

17
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:36,484
Speaker 2: also if you're Looking for our Otacon coverage It will be beginning next Monday And we'll go for approximately two weeks as we are currently out of town And we don't have the ability to upload let alone edit anything together.

18
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:52,550
Speaker 1: thus without further ado It's Monday 7th of August and this is geek nights.

19
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,670
Speaker 1: Tonight we'll be discussing stupid dumb Apple fanboys, and why geeks make the best boyfriends.

20
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,028
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

21
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:08,750
Speaker 1: Hello everybody welcome to geek night hello.

00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:13,588
Speaker 1: let's explain.

24
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:14,792
Speaker 0: okay Let's do that.

25
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:20,490
Speaker 1: so at the beginning you had just heard rim and Scott explaining that this isn't a normal episode of geek nights at all.

26
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:25,762
Speaker 1: You know we are The guest podcasters yeah, and we are part of.

27
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:26,866
Speaker 1: we're not all of.

28
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,230
Speaker 1: we're part of movies.

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,989
Speaker 1: You should see rim and Scott have actually been on our show a couple of times anyway, so the chances are you might hurt them.

30
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:40,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, hurt us hurt us indeed, so hopefully you did you know because they did some really good spots for us.

31
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:41,815
Speaker 1: I was pleased with them.

32
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,567
Speaker 1: actually last week's show last week's city of God check it out.

33
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:46,390
Speaker 0: It's a good show.

34
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,035
Speaker 1: We will plug later.

35
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:48,617
Speaker 0: Okay.

36
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:52,370
Speaker 0: We'll plug later, but that's those anyway Richard and Alison from movies.

37
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:52,953
Speaker 0: You should see.

38
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,789
Speaker 1: we should say hello to Craig Mike and Tristan who are also part of it.

39
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are.

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,467
Speaker 0: they should have been here tonight, but we have a little mishap.

41
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:03,437
Speaker 0: yesterday The clutch burn out in the car.

42
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:06,950
Speaker 1: well basically every one of us who owns a car has had it die in the last two.

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,703
Speaker 1: That's right, so nobody's going anywhere, and we didn't want to do this over Skype.

44
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:11,325
Speaker 0: No.

45
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,589
Speaker 1: No that would have been crap.

46
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,940
Speaker 1: so Basically, we're just gonna do a normal episode of geek nights.

47
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,770
Speaker 1: Yeah excellent so shall we kick off?

48
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,232
Speaker 0: We should.

49
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,340
Speaker 1: so we start with the news.

50
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:25,090
Speaker 1: okay happening well this week.

51
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:27,954
Speaker 1: Top of the Pops.

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:37,099
Speaker 1: yeah a British institution absolutely played its last episode After 42 years, that's the significant thing I suppose.

53
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,038
Speaker 1: if you don't know what top of the Pops is it's basically a weekly music show That's been on TV for the last 42 years.

54
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, where banners go on and they do the top 10 countdown and that sort of thing.

55
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,097
Speaker 0: It's basically the the TV equivalent of the chart show they tell us.

56
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:58,530
Speaker 0: What it's number one on a Sunday and What used to happen is top of the Pops was on a Thursday?

57
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:04,130
Speaker 0: And it got you geared up and buying records ready for the chart to be announced on Sunday.

58
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:15,970
Speaker 0: so it showed you everybody who's in the chart showed you how many places that had gone up and gone down and It really was something that was really part of my childhood and my teenage years.

59
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,394
Speaker 1: I never watched it.

60
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:21,670
Speaker 1: You know really never once have I sat through an episode of top of the Pops.

61
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,327
Speaker 0: It was my entire week the focus of my week when I was a kid like 10 12 years old.

62
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:34,903
Speaker 0: I loved that show and it would be the one thing that was guaranteed that I could watch Uninterrupted in the house.

63
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:44,650
Speaker 0: that was my program, and I think pretty much every teenage girl That type did until something happened in the UK and music started getting really really crap.

64
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,480
Speaker 1: and oh you mean the late 80s?

65
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:54,201
Speaker 1: well yeah and Actually mainstream music the very late 90s up until now.

66
00:04:54,221 --> 00:05:03,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had the Brit pop thing which made everything exciting again and And the MTV thing I guess took quite a bit away from shows like top of the Pops.

67
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,957
Speaker 1: Well, that's what they're saying.

68
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:10,112
Speaker 1: killed top of the Pops, and I think that's perfectly fair for them to say I think it's fair.

69
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:15,330
Speaker 1: You know who cares about a once weekly music show when we've got 24-hour music?

70
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:23,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get to see your favorite videos 25 times a day if you channel serve the right channels And so that kind of led to the demise.

71
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:34,730
Speaker 0: But my favorite days of top of the Pops were back when I was a child because you used to have these Horrific dancers on there were they pans people pans people.

72
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,616
Speaker 1: Let's explain about pans people.

73
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:45,169
Speaker 1: This is a very special part of our history part of our social history British culture, and it's embarrassing it really is.

74
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,630
Speaker 0: I'm sure they have kind of equivalent naffness in other countries around the world.

75
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,935
Speaker 0: I think we can get away with it.

76
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,283
Speaker 1: There was never naffness to this degree.

77
00:05:53,765 --> 00:06:05,939
Speaker 0: right go on pans people were a group of Young women who were probably aged about 18 to 30 and and they were quite Posh, oh yeah like it.

78
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,002
Speaker 1: They were a bit poncy.

79
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:14,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were dancers and Back in the days before video promos were available for pop songs in the charts.

80
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:21,069
Speaker 0: These women used to come on and do very literal Dancers that were about the song.

81
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,578
Speaker 0: So you got some amazing kind of dancers.

82
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,309
Speaker 0: I can't remember what the song was but it had dogs in it.

83
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:36,489
Speaker 0: For some reason it had puppies in it or something like that and and sure enough They had puppies on the stage in their dance.

84
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:43,870
Speaker 0: It was just the most ridiculous thing ever Trying to get these shout suits to stay still while they're doing massive leg kicks and stuff.

85
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,089
Speaker 0: It was horrific.

86
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:52,110
Speaker 0: But I think that everybody loved him because they're a bit sexy really and it was the most leg and body that had ever been.

87
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,677
Speaker 1: Run she's thing on TV at the time by a long way.

88
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,734
Speaker 0: Horrendous costumes.

89
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,179
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, it was horrific.

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,010
Speaker 1: You're probably Google pans people and see all of this.

91
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think baby doll 90s and that kind of thing very funny.

92
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,842
Speaker 0: You have to see it The facial expressions to go along with this song.

93
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,630
Speaker 0: It's just cheese on a stick.

94
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:20,310
Speaker 0: It really is expertly done, but that's kind of what made top of the pop so special.

95
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,655
Speaker 0: It was a very British thing.

96
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:25,250
Speaker 0: It was very British dance troupe and it it was just the cream of cheese.

97
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:26,154
Speaker 1: It really was.

98
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,439
Speaker 1: you see the problem.

99
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,468
Speaker 1: Here's an issue I had with it, right?

100
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,220
Speaker 1: The bands that play on top of the pops when they do so-called live Performances and doing the thingies with my fingers.

101
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,430
Speaker 1: this speech marks with my fingers the live performances, right?

102
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,996
Speaker 1: They're not doing live performance.

103
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,240
Speaker 1: No, they were at best.

104
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,049
Speaker 1: They recorded that performance earlier on in the day.

105
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,098
Speaker 1: But probably and I've seen this a lot.

106
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,863
Speaker 1: They sing the album version.

107
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:53,849
Speaker 1: They've blatantly just brought a CD with them.

108
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that, right?

109
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:58,050
Speaker 1: So they're miming and we know they're miming.

110
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:06,199
Speaker 0: It's happened by spectacularly on there as well where the dot machines Just gonna just sat there with blank expressions on the faces.

111
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,470
Speaker 0: the song plays in the background like what's going on all about Eve.

112
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,995
Speaker 0: That's who it happened to.

113
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:12,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, brilliant.

114
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,466
Speaker 1: That one's played on TV quite a lot is yeah.

115
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:24,005
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's just a nice little Example of the naffness of the program, but they're miming.

116
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:25,309
Speaker 1: we know they're miming.

117
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:26,617
Speaker 1: They know that.

118
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,490
Speaker 1: we know they're miming right.

119
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:35,809
Speaker 1: So essentially what it becomes is they're just doing a dance to their song.

120
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:40,169
Speaker 0: It's kind of we know it's like watching someone play a guitar.

121
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,414
Speaker 1: We know nobody.

122
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,206
Speaker 1: we know there's no music being performed in front of us.

123
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,050
Speaker 1: Nothing at all.

124
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:45,773
Speaker 1: We know.

125
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,589
Speaker 1: essentially what they're doing is dancing for us.

126
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:57,227
Speaker 1: They're just dancing in a way that look that they're playing at being a band But it's getting 15 year olds a chance to have a look at.

127
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,733
Speaker 1: well That's what it's there.

128
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:05,375
Speaker 1: Is it because the entire studio is there for you pay a fortune to get your song on top of the Pop so that it gets promoted.

129
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:06,800
Speaker 1: Oh, come on.

130
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,883
Speaker 0: Is it fair to say that?

131
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:09,909
Speaker 1: Of course, it's perfectly fair to say that.

132
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,525
Speaker 1: It's massively fair to say that because when will young one pop idol?

133
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:24,930
Speaker 1: Oh him there was massive Controversy over the fact that they were trying to pay for him to have two songs on the same episode, which no one has ever done.

134
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,195
Speaker 0: Was that a double-a-side job II?

135
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,560
Speaker 1: that was yes, right.

136
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,061
Speaker 0: Okay.

137
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,766
Speaker 0: He wants to get married actually.

138
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:31,629
Speaker 1: Oh, let him.

139
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,074
Speaker 0: That's what I say.

140
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:33,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's the?

141
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:34,459
Speaker 0: do an album?

142
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,470
Speaker 1: We should explain for anyone that doesn't know Williams gay.

143
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,989
Speaker 1: So getting there is an unusual, but he's allowed to do that here, which is special.

144
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:44,413
Speaker 1: Where were we?

145
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:51,598
Speaker 1: so yeah, so everyone who's on it is doing a little dance for us right from Christina Aguilera To the Gallagher brothers in Oasis.

146
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,330
Speaker 1: They're just doing a little dance for us, which is weird.

147
00:09:54,911 --> 00:10:00,425
Speaker 1: I find that weird because again, we all know that but we pretend that they're playing live.

148
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:10,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess Which is just crazy and always kind of made me want to buy songs a little bit more When I'd seen them, I want to see the videos.

149
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:24,250
Speaker 0: When videos first came out, they were amazing and you got to see things like oh god dire straits The MTV one, you know the money for nothing which was just the most amazing thing in the world when it came.

150
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,256
Speaker 1: There was nothing like that being seen.

151
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:31,577
Speaker 0: so so we started replacing pop stars with videos and you wouldn't get as many live Performances at.

152
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:32,750
Speaker 0: well not live.

153
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,176
Speaker 0: You get a video.

154
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,910
Speaker 0: you kind of felt a little while after you were being a little bit cheated.

155
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:49,684
Speaker 1: You actually want to see the band videos of the biggest cheat in the music industry Bar nothing because they're advertising to get you to buy the single.

156
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,790
Speaker 1: and now we're paying for videos.

157
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:56,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're paying to buy Advertising to make us buy something else.

158
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:57,450
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

159
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,610
Speaker 0: I'd much rather see a performer actually mime in front of me then see the same video.

160
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:05,994
Speaker 1: Dance for me.

161
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:06,395
Speaker 1: come on.

162
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:07,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what we need.

163
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,070
Speaker 0: I think you know in America with was it Dick Clark in America?

164
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:20,490
Speaker 0: he had like a show kind of like that whether you have a Band on and they come and play in front of a live studio audience and then you get to see it at home.

165
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:29,579
Speaker 0: It's kind of like, you know Just a live pop show and the only thing that we've got like that now in this country is like Jules Holland And he's not playing pop.

166
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,733
Speaker 1: He's playing the stuff jazz and blues Good stuff.

167
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:35,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, the good stuff good stuff.

168
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:36,986
Speaker 0: My thing is right.

169
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:40,249
Speaker 0: when I was a child I thought I'd always loved Top of the Pops.

170
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:45,745
Speaker 0: No, I did because I thought this this rules and this is where music is.

171
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,028
Speaker 0: no, I mean, no you haven't always loved it I haven't always loved it.

172
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,810
Speaker 0: I fell out of love with it when I started thinking I can't cope with British pop culture.

173
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's what's done it.

174
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:07,233
Speaker 1: in a final nail in the coffin in a program that only plays music you'd governed by What music's out.

175
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:07,635
Speaker 1: that's.

176
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,604
Speaker 1: if there's nothing good out there's nothing you can play and nothing you can do.

177
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:20,049
Speaker 1: so maybe again Simon Cowell the root of all evil in the universe where the shit pop music has destroyed Top of the Pops.

178
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,250
Speaker 1: if You trace every bad thing in the universe that happens it goes back to Simon Cowell.

179
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,357
Speaker 0: You really don't like him.

180
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:35,850
Speaker 1: everything everything pick anything you want I will trace it back to Simon Cowell and the decline of the British pop music industry.

181
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:37,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely very orange.

182
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:41,126
Speaker 1: He is and his waistband is far too high.

183
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:41,627
Speaker 0: That's right.

184
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:47,637
Speaker 0: And he's a No I just opposed him generally and everything about him, but enough enough.

185
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:59,028
Speaker 1: Jimmy Saville, sir Jimmy said night of the realm who?

186
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:12,625
Speaker 1: Introduced the very first Top of the Pops episode for two years ago The Top of the Pops God Stone's right-wing Moron, I love Jimmy Saville for one reason one reason alone.

187
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:20,490
Speaker 0: He's the first man to get two turntables and Put two records on and try and play them simultaneously.

188
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:24,430
Speaker 0: So he's the first ever proper turntable DJ.

189
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,704
Speaker 0: it lasted for one song and the entire equipment blew up.

190
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:34,101
Speaker 0: and it was Upstairs at the Otley working men's club in Leeds.

191
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,291
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it happened in 1962.

192
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,555
Speaker 0: I believe that's amazing.

193
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,742
Speaker 0: So for that reason alone, Jimmy Saville.

194
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:48,007
Speaker 1: Yeah God the oldest man still smoking cigars Since what's his name died?

195

Speaker 1: maybe I don't know Should have thought that through more before I started saying it But he he was the guy who turned out the lights on the last episode in only the crap way the BBC could do.

201
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,454
Speaker 1: How should we finish it?

202
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,485
Speaker 1: We'll wait till the opening the closing credits have finished and we'll have sir.

00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:23,107
Speaker 1: Can you?

206
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:27,969
Speaker 0: yeah I'm quite upset by this little frail old man in his running suit.

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,302
Speaker 0: And he's got a running suit and he's jangly jangly jewelry jewelry.

Speaker 1: It's over now.

210
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:36,669
Speaker 1: That's probably Dyson.

211
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:47,365
Speaker 1: That's really sad very very old though, so well it would just be time but looking at his picture I think he is dead.

212
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:52,467
Speaker 0: Well, you know, he's missed his mom since she went the old Duchess 40 years ago.

217
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:04,369
Speaker 1: How does that mean?

218
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:12,243
Speaker 0: Cash mine back to all those wonderful top of the pop seam jeans that you've only had.

219
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,045

00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:22,030

00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:33,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, nevermind get that It was a wicked show and I'm I'm gonna miss it retrospectively seen as I stopped watching it about ten years ago.

226
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:36,213
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm just old.

227
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:36,935
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

228

Speaker 0: Yeah middle-aged old me.

229
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:48,151
Speaker 1: Oh looking at this news report going back to the crap music I think it's worth noting that the last song played on top of the pops was Shakira.

230
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,816
Speaker 1: Shakira and Wyclef Jean's hips.

231
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,040
Speaker 0: don't lie hips.

232
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,843
Speaker 0: Don't lie.

233
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:54,150
Speaker 1: There's a mark of good music.

234
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,086
Speaker 1: It's good, isn't it?

235
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:03,754
Speaker 0: Here tell me I had too many pies And they're not lying.

236
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:05,579
Speaker 1: I'm too gentlemanly to agree with him.

237
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're not gentlemanly enough not to laugh.

238
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:11,428
Speaker 1: It's hard not to laugh.

239
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:25,918
Speaker 1: Let's move on moving on Things of the day.

240
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,504

246
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:39,659
Speaker 1: I ever listened to.

247
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,053
Speaker 1: yeah The thing that I actually enjoyed the most Was the closing credits music really?

248
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,240
Speaker 1: I Don't mean that like when I joke the film is really bad and I say that the best bit was when it faded to black.

249
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,009
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean actually the music.

250
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,053

Speaker 0: I really like that.

252
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,400
Speaker 1: I can't ask them more about where it comes from.

253
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:06,680
Speaker 0: Okay, so my thing of the day your thing of the day is this really cool little video.

254
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,635

255
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:11,659

Speaker 1: Well, that'll do.

258
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:14,753
Speaker 1: Sorry.

259
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:16,020
Speaker 1: I'm being overly cautious.

260
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:23,221
Speaker 0: Oh This little video is entitled collaboration 2001.

261
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:26,089
Speaker 0: I must stress that the collaboration is spelled with a K.

262
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,117
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.

263
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:34,115
Speaker 0: Right and And and 2001. there's quite a few files on there from collaboration.

264
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:48,560
Speaker 0: It seems to me I don't really know but it looks like a Korean sort of youth culture festival Korean American youth culture festival Where they go and they do street dance and that kind of thing and generally have a good time and show off their mad skills.

265
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:56,400
Speaker 0: and this little clip is of Three guys who do some body popping.

266
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,287
Speaker 1: It's yeah, it's body popping.

267
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:01,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what we call it.

268
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:02,077
Speaker 0: Is it?

269
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,704
Speaker 1: I don't know Robotic dancing.

270
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,400
Speaker 0: I'm calling it body popping because I don't know what else to call it.

271
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:20,200
Speaker 1: You see we say body popping and I think Back in the 80s with all the pop in the color Which is a little bit of it is in there, but this is a master class.

272
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,455
Speaker 0: There's two guys who were on first and you think they're all right.

273
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:24,460
Speaker 0: You think they're pretty good.

274
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:36,929
Speaker 0: They've got some moves and stuff and then this guy called Nathan from Santa Anna Comes on and just throws down the maddest moves I've ever seen a human being contort themselves into.

275
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,419
Speaker 1: this is certainly something that has to be seen to be believed.

276
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,540
Speaker 0: Yeah I think the guy's body is amazing.

277
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:53,457
Speaker 0: He can command it to do pretty much what he wants to do and he goes up from being like a solid piece of wood To something that's liquid and melting.

278
00:18:53,477 --> 00:19:04,992
Speaker 0: He's Absolutely astounding and I've seen it so many times now, but the guy just makes me go Every time I see it, it's awesome.

279
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,980
Speaker 1: It is it's just amazing.

280
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:10,560
Speaker 1: I want to say something more intelligent about it than it's just amazing.

281
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,440
Speaker 1: You do get the feeling that this kid might have been in some kind of accident or something.

282
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:33,737
Speaker 1: I can understand the how I can't make my body do the robot bit and the dancing Yeah, but when he just try when he just puts himself into a position like when he does that bit with his shoulders Yeah, I think well, why can't I do that?

283
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,149
Speaker 1: Cuz what is it about your body that mine doesn't have?

284
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,815
Speaker 1: or mine has that yours doesn't?

285
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,039
Speaker 0: I don't know.

286
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,286
Speaker 0: It's that I love this bit.

287
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:47,320
Speaker 0: You'll know it when you see it that he kind of makes like there's something underneath his jumper.

288
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:49,504
Speaker 1: See, that's clever.

289
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,889
Speaker 1: That's skillful.

290
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:51,490
Speaker 1: I get that.

291
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:52,654
Speaker 1: I can't do that.

292
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:53,737
Speaker 1: I'm happy with that.

293
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,645
Speaker 1: That's okay But you know the bit.

294
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:58,211
Speaker 1: why can his body do things?

295
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:58,653

00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:45,424
Speaker 1: This is something that It's actually to me.

335
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:48,954
Speaker 1: it's a video of everything that is wrong in the world today.

336
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:56,840
Speaker 1: I Think You know say never mind Simon Cowell ignore him.

337
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:11,060
Speaker 1: I think what this video shows is just the problem with the world as it is and that is I Don't know fucked up middle-class white boys.

338
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,225
Speaker 0: You think they're middle-class.

339
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:17,097
Speaker 0: I got a video camera from somewhere and I say I don't think they're middle-class.

340
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,060
Speaker 1: you see I look at them.

341
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,574
Speaker 1: I think your mum's an accountant your dad is a doctor and you don't like it.

342
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,360
Speaker 0: You see I don't get that at all.

343
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:33,736
Speaker 0: I get parents are divorced Dad's not at home They're doing spliffs and fat since they were about 12.

344
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,884
Speaker 0: They've got no prospects No, hope in life.

345
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:41,624
Speaker 0: and this is literally them with a borrowed mates all stolen Come card.

346
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:44,996
Speaker 1: These are the kids that are gonna rob our kids in 20 years, aren't they?

347
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:45,798
Speaker 0: Yes, dear.

348
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:46,019
Speaker 0: Really?

349
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:49,206
Speaker 0: It's all kids like them.

350
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:51,272
Speaker 0: Let's say that kids very like them.

351
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:59,875
Speaker 0: Mmm, because we're talking about a particular subset of British culture here that is known as a chav We should explain the chav.

352
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,299
Speaker 0: We should.

353
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,143
Speaker 0: There's a really really good website Call.

354
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:19,206
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah chav town.com that chav chav chav and it will tell you all about what a chav is what they wear how they speak where they go what they buy and the rest of it.

355
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:28,240
Speaker 0: it's an entire subculture and These choice young gentlemen that you have a particularly fine examples of breed.

356
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,924
Speaker 1: Yes It's.

357
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,714
Speaker 1: it's part of believing that.

358
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:38,315
Speaker 1: well Maybe that you're better at something than you perhaps are.

359
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,960
Speaker 0: I think It's a striving of getting out of the crappy shitty life that you live because let's not make any bonds about it.

360
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:51,840
Speaker 0: I think these guys are poor and I think they come from a poor background and it's about striving to get out.

361
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,684
Speaker 1: We've not even said what they do yet.

362
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:54,807
Speaker 1: That's my fault.

363
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:55,449
Speaker 1: I apologise.

364
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,050
Speaker 0: This is funny.

365
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:57,414
Speaker 0: They're rapping.

366
00:23:57,594 --> 00:24:00,864
Speaker 1: It's basically a video of three kids Rapping.

367
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:04,640
Speaker 1: they're called the kersal massive k-e-r-s-a-l massive.

368
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:09,154
Speaker 1: They're three of them and in actual fact they're quite, that's massive.

369
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:10,700
Speaker 1: They're quite small as well.

370
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean especially what's his name?

371
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,480
Speaker 0: little Kev not Kev our little Kev.

372
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,439
Speaker 0: He's about 12 so we can deduce from the little video that we've got.

373
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:30,360
Speaker 1: but this is a prime example of what happens when you give everyone a voice and As wonderful a thing as that is that we have the freedom in the world for everyone to have a voice.

374
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:35,920
Speaker 1: We realize perhaps that not many people have a great deal to say yet say it anyway.

375
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's what this shows.

376
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:47,511
Speaker 1: I think You know, I get the whole being poor and rapping your way out of the ghetto Whatever not that they live in a ghetto.

377
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:49,540
Speaker 0: These guys are not three M&Ms.

378
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:56,354
Speaker 1: M&M can do such a thing because the man is actually to be fair.

379
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,806
Speaker 1: whether you write like rap music or not He's shit out of what he does.

380
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I couldn't do that.

381
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:02,839
Speaker 1: He's not in a million years.

382
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,693
Speaker 1: There you go.

383
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,379
Speaker 1: You've got my time.

384
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:09,440
Speaker 0: These guys do this isn't M&M style rap?

385
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:23,392
Speaker 0: This isn't like that kind of American twang rap that you know, no these guys are rapping with black British accents Which just makes it even funnier cuz they're talking in it.

386
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:26,000
Speaker 0: Is it all that kind of crap?

387
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,740
Speaker 1: This is this is part of the most annoying thing that is happening in this country at the moment.

388
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:36,240
Speaker 1: Is this this overbearing need to respond to any part of conversation with the words?

389
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:36,921
Speaker 1: Is it?

390
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,707
Speaker 1: is it hello?

391
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:42,039
Speaker 1: Is it no what it's always questions.

392
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:51,927
Speaker 0: Example was that girl when I asked her where she worked and she says I'll work on one just the road daughter Dora, I don't know.

393
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:52,530
Speaker 0: I don't know.

394
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,213
Speaker 0: I asked you.

395
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:58,413
Speaker 0: weird anyway But that's the kind of language that these kids talking.

396
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:01,844
Speaker 0: it's not like an American rappers Hip-hop accent.

397
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:06,360
Speaker 0: It's black British hip-hop accent, and it's very silly.

398
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:09,796
Speaker 1: Well, the thing that winds me up about it is that it's totally made up.

399
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:25,259
Speaker 1: It's not like it is completely Made up and it's not like these people actually have these accents or actually come from a culture like that In the backseat, yeah, cuz I ain't they're not even old enough to drive a car.

400
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:31,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're talking about the mom's clear at one point and I mean we're talking Shop a car.

401
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:34,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, he opens up by talking about getting on the bus with this saver card.

402
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:37,886
Speaker 0: It does In on board with me.

403
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:38,288

Speaker 1: People who've been listening to geek nights for a little while will remember the tale about the guy who had his appendix out.

408
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:59,667
Speaker 1: I was that guy and actually as per Either Rima Scott's recommendation.

409
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:00,470
Speaker 1: I think it was rim.

410
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,940

447
00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:06,015
Speaker 1: There was a little kid outside the shop and he was Little roly-poly kid.

448
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:08,625
Speaker 1: He must have been about 14, but he was a little.

449
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,070
Speaker 1: he was the fat kid in his class.

450
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:13,789
Speaker 1: You know the little pink face with his little bobble at home.

451
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,722

Speaker 1: And I said no look if you don't drink beer, you'll lose weight and girls will like you And you won't need to drink beer anymore with him who quite frankly looks like he's been sipping antifreeze.

454
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:37,576
Speaker 1: No one's gonna say to these kids Because you're the little chubby kid.

455
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:45,600
Speaker 1: I get it I was a little chubby kid but drinking beer outside a Convenience store is not gonna help.

Speaker 1: No, that's not gonna get you.

457
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,230

00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz that would be tragic.

485
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:46,072
Speaker 1: so a Main topic main topic.

486
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:51,987
Speaker 1: This was quite tricky Because although You're quite geeky.

487
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:53,876
Speaker 1: I am as girlfriends.

488
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:54,720
Speaker 1: Go you're very good.

489
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,522
Speaker 1: Um, as far as as geekery goes you're excellent without without going too far Right.

490
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:01,945
Speaker 0: Okay.

491
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,679
Speaker 0: So on a scale of one to ten, how geeky am I?

492
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,246
Speaker 1: You're sort of six.

493
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,614
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

494
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:09,760
Speaker 0: I'm happy with this.

495
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:10,626
Speaker 0: I played worried.

496
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,480
Speaker 0: if I was a seven I'd be upset.

497
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was an eight.

498
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:16,500
Speaker 0: I'd be in counseling if I was a nine and that'd be you if I was ten.

499
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's fair to say.

500
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,353
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not a ten.

501
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:21,784

00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:24,995
Speaker 0: That's true.

504
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:27,731
Speaker 0: There's a couple of things Let's be honest, but it's not bad.

505
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:30,603
Speaker 1: Oh, there's things like Spirited away.

506
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,589

508
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:41,353
Speaker 1: you do But you know, there's I would be fair to say this far geekier than me.

509
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,360
Speaker 1: There's no comic books in the toilet.

510
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:45,300
Speaker 0: We met a geek a few weeks ago.

511
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,653
Speaker 0: Can you remember he had like one of every computer.

512
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:50,180

00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:58,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, we found ourselves in this guy's house for one reason or another.

515
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,176
Speaker 1: We were seeing a friend of ours who was in his house.

516
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:06,335
Speaker 1: Yeah And this guy we start talking and he's like you like computers.

517
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:07,699
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

518
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,560
Speaker 1: Well, you've got to see these.

519
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:17,580
Speaker 1: Oh One of every computer ever made pretty much most of them worked as well.

520
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:25,002
Speaker 0: he just kept getting another one out and another one out and it'd be like from 1982 and 1987.

521
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:30,497
Speaker 1: he had every Nintendo ever and they were all plugged in and working in his living room.

522
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were playing Donkey Kong Weren't we?

523
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,003
Speaker 0: Yeah Fantastic.

524
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:36,554
Speaker 0: I mean that guy plays World of Warcraft.

525
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:37,800
Speaker 0: He's got the beard.

526
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:39,540
Speaker 0: He's got the anime.

527
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:44,075
Speaker 0: He had the most anime I've ever seen in one place at any one time.

528
00:33:44,115 --> 00:33:50,259
Speaker 1: to be fair looking at him Where he wish to walk into a comic book store in Springfield and find him sat behind the counter.

529
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:59,940
Speaker 1: Now actually I my ex when I got my xbox chipped a couple of years ago The guy who did it actually was comic book guy.

530
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:04,200
Speaker 1: He was this big fat guy sat on the barstool behind the counter in the game show.

531
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 1: He had even had the greasy ponytail and the beard and everything.

532
00:34:10,643 --> 00:34:11,688
Speaker 1: It was fantastic.

533
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,935
Speaker 1: He I can't remember what it was about But he even connected corrected my pronunciation of a technical term.

534
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:18,998
Speaker 1: I was in there.

535
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,346
Speaker 1: He was comic book guy.

536
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:24,335
Speaker 1: and you just want to say to these guys like cuz you must know.

537
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's seen The Simpsons.

538
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,851
Speaker 1: He's seen comic book guy.

539
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:36,780
Speaker 1: He can probably quote every episode to me And so he must know he must sit there looking at himself at the screen at himself.

540
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,007
Speaker 0: Do you know who I think I am?

541
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,317
Speaker 0: Comic book guy.

542
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:40,824
Speaker 1: maybe Episode ever.

543
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:43,976
Speaker 1: Why are we doing bad Simpsons Impressions?

544
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:44,800
Speaker 1: I can't do Impressions.

545
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,693
Speaker 1: So we're talking about dumb Apple fanboys.

546
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:49,958
Speaker 0: We're talking about you.

547
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:55,158
Speaker 1: This is a unique phenomenon within the technical industry.

548
00:34:55,217 --> 00:35:00,185
Speaker 1: I believe in that Every company has its fans.

549
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:01,027
Speaker 1: every at.

550
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:06,020
Speaker 1: every company who makes stuff has people who only buy people who are brand loyal.

551
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,606
Speaker 1: We know what.

552
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:10,557
Speaker 1: Mike for example only has Sony stuff in his room.

553
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:11,460
Speaker 0: That's true.

554
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:19,840
Speaker 1: I keep trying to tell him that Sony are and the second force of all evil Other than Simon Cowell, but he keeps buying it because it's all already there and he likes it to match.

555
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,880
Speaker 1: But Apple fanboys are a law unto themselves.

556
00:35:24,863 --> 00:35:30,500
Speaker 0: This is very very true and something that is is becoming more apparent to me the longer I live with you.

557
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:31,862
Speaker 1: Now.

558
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,328
Speaker 1: I wasn't always like this.

559
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,653
Speaker 1: It has to be said.

560
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:36,260
Speaker 0: I know you caught a bug.

561
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:39,950
Speaker 1: I caught a bug about a year and a half ago I think.

562
00:35:40,030 --> 00:36:07,615
Speaker 1: cuz I work in a production company and when we all got together to begin with out of the four of us three of us worked on PCs religiously and there was Luke who had a Mac and At the time it was this weird little g3 blue Purple kind of rather girly affair that didn't really do anything and compared to the PC I had at the time it was well shit quite frankly and it crashed all the time.

563
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:12,580
Speaker 1: recently we have Smashed it up with a big bat, which was quite sad.

564
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:14,187
Speaker 1: No, we didn't.

565
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,260
Speaker 1: we should have done that actually and put it on YouTube with this slew of other.

566
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, watch me smash my Mac videos.

567
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,415
Speaker 1: But I think it was also then hurled off something big tired of being fun.

568
00:36:24,676 --> 00:36:25,217
Speaker 1: It was fun.

569
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:28,305
Speaker 1: Yeah I've lost track now.

570
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:36,517
Speaker 1: the g3 sat in the corner of the office the g3 sat in the corner of the office And then we we sort of bought our own or all our new equipment.

571
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:43,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Part of that was brand new spanky g5 power Mac that one that's up right there.

572
00:36:43,221 --> 00:36:52,376
Speaker 1: No, that was that's my one the one in the office The new one and this was unlike anything I had ever seen before in my life.

573
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:59,420
Speaker 1: actually for the first six months We sort of we were speaking behind each of those backs about Luke going, you know, we've got to get him on to PCs.

574
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:01,006
Speaker 1: What's this Mac shit?

575
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,251
Speaker 1: He's got going on.

576
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:05,993
Speaker 1: We can't be having this, you know I don't care how compatible is.

577
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:07,202
Speaker 1: don't want it Don't want it.

578
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:17,045
Speaker 1: got to get more and then I used it and three days and nights later I was physically removed from it because other work had to be done on it and that was pretty much it.

579
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:27,975
Speaker 1: and then those of you who have bought one will probably relate to the Stories of going to the Apple Store page over and over again building your ideal spec.

580
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:28,897
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

581
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,723
Speaker 0: I remember this Clearly.

582
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:35,760
Speaker 1: do I get the slightly bigger hard drive or the bigger graphics card?

583
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:40,853
Speaker 0: I can recall one night when you sat here and did that very task.

584
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:50,920
Speaker 0: over and over again over and over again We were coming up with figures that were near 12,000 pounds or that was my dream system was your dream system and you were really going for it.

585
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,197
Speaker 0: you're going for the top end of everything and every add-on that you could get.

586
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,679
Speaker 0: that was New and zippy and I want I still do that.

587
00:37:59,061 --> 00:37:59,644
Speaker 1: I still do it.

588
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,700
Speaker 1: only my ideal system is now sixteen and a half thousand pounds.

589
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,770
Speaker 1: That's just which is crazy for a computer.

590
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,375
Speaker 1: I mean really what does it do?

591
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,860
Speaker 1: Is it that much faster than mine?

592
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:10,605
Speaker 1: Probably not to be fair.

593
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,069
Speaker 0: You can buy cars for that.

594
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,734
Speaker 0: You can buy nice car.

595
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:15,880
Speaker 1: You can buy houses for that in some places.

596
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,602
Speaker 1: Let's be honest.

597
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:16,964
Speaker 1: Yeah.

598
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can which is ridiculous.

599
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,520
Speaker 1: Do I buy a power Mac or a house?

600
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:28,026
Speaker 0: Well given where that house would be in a really crummy area I'd actually get the Mac again.

601
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:31,558
Speaker 1: get the Mac and you can live in them as well.

602
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:32,180
Speaker 1: They're that big.

603
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,340
Speaker 1: They've got a bedroom on sweet.

604
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:35,128
Speaker 0: They don't.

605
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,406
Speaker 1: The next one will have.

606
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:38,009
Speaker 0: no they don't.

607
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:39,697
Speaker 1: Steve will bring it for me.

608
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:40,320
Speaker 0: He won't.

609
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:47,673
Speaker 1: so let's talk some more about How this is, you know, the more I'm talking about it.

610
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,680
Speaker 1: I'm actually starting to feel ashamed of myself.

611
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,219
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you see I was hoping that this might come out because this is good therapy for is it?

612
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,084
Speaker 1: This is gonna make us stronger as a couple I'm hoping so.

613
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:07,259
Speaker 0: maybe I'm hoping so because we're gonna both get to air outside of the story And you're going to realize that you're quite sad.

614
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:11,632
Speaker 1: Well, let's explain how it starts because as I say, I wasn't always like this.

615
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:14,400
Speaker 1: it starts with seeing it for the first time.

616
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is a rather beautiful machine.

617
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,956
Speaker 1: No, I don't want to get into the whole.

618
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:20,040
Speaker 1: I think they're brilliant.

619
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:21,468
Speaker 1: So you should go out and buy one.

620
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:25,149
Speaker 1: I'm not I don't want to talk about you that a lot Yeah, but I'm not in this case.

621
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:31,320
Speaker 1: I'm just talking about the experience of being The dumb fanboy rather that I'm not I don't want to get into which is better.

622
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,947
Speaker 0: Just explain what it's like when you look at that.

623
00:39:34,987 --> 00:39:46,840
Speaker 1: so for me you start building it and then it starts because You get yours and then something else comes out and you think well Wish I got that one because that's happened to you already.

624
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:48,700
Speaker 1: That's happened to a lot of people already.

625
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,520
Speaker 1: There was Craig who bought his g5 and then the week after the new one came out Yeah, and then my dad bought one of those and then the week after the Intel one came out.

626
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,329
Speaker 1: Two very upset people who are now very happy.

627
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,480
Speaker 0: you see that that marks on the downside for Apple.

628
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,513
Speaker 0: I think the quick no, no, no, no, no, that's.

629
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,120
Speaker 1: that's completely unfair.

630
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:12,640
Speaker 1: How often do you let Packard release a computer with the next Intel processor in?

631
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,865
Speaker 1: How often do they all do that?

632
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:25,028
Speaker 1: We only know with Apple because there's there's like two different machines and because Everybody watches them so closely Fools like me.

633
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:31,735
Speaker 1: this is that the key RSS feed Updating every 30 minutes linked to Mac daily news.

634
00:40:31,836 --> 00:40:38,135
Speaker 1: This is the key Richard Yeah to get rumors about things that are never ever gonna happen.

635
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:38,857
Speaker 0: Yeah.

636
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:46,473
Speaker 1: Oh And it's just stupid made-up things that make the news and we get so excited But you look at them and you just go straight away.

637
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:47,499
Speaker 0: Well, that's not real.

638
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,968
Speaker 1: I know I do that but then I get excited.

639
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,175
Speaker 1: This is what's so stupid about it.

640
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,740
Speaker 1: I'm not a dumb person.

641
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:59,978
Speaker 1: I can I can read things and decide and well think with education that that's stupid.

642
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:02,607
Speaker 0: and You see the rabbit and you start running.

643
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,049
Speaker 1: you want it.

644
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:07,542
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just like this.

645
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:26,300
Speaker 1: this latest one about the phone where there's this news report came out that this guy who knows a guy who's a Technology did a photo shoot for Apple allegedly and Allegedly photoed what he just described as the best-looking phone he's ever seen in his life.

646
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:29,119
Speaker 1: But it's probably a complete load of toss.

647
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:32,312
Speaker 0: But what did you say there was in the car going?

648
00:41:32,332 --> 00:41:34,480
Speaker 1: I know it's probably not true, but it's coming.

649
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,739
Speaker 1: That means it's coming next.

650
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,773
Speaker 1: What the hell is this about what?

651
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,256
Speaker 1: how does it happen what?

652
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:43,660
Speaker 1: what has it done to me?

653
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:49,778
Speaker 0: You've got that nice silver shiny beautiful box there and I'm going to agree with you.

654
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,968
Speaker 0: it's Aesthetically a beautiful machine.

655
00:41:53,109 --> 00:42:00,918
Speaker 0: Oh when you turn it on the screens are beautiful and You've got that and then you realize it's a beautiful thing.

656
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:11,196
Speaker 0: And beautiful things are very intoxicating and you want more beautiful things, especially when the beautiful thing looks rather beautiful Alongside the other beautiful things.

657
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:22,970
Speaker 0: Yeah And then they bring out another beautiful thing that is equally beautiful alongside both of those beautiful things and suddenly have to have every beautiful thing that has an Apple logo stamped on it.

658
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,918
Speaker 1: and then they give you stickers so that you can put Apple logos on Things that shouldn't have Apple logos on them.

659
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:28,782
Speaker 0: Yeah What we got?

660
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:34,520
Speaker 0: we got a little girly pink paper box on the mantelpiece that's got an Apple sticker on it.

661
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:35,418
Speaker 0: I put it there.

662
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:40,435
Speaker 0: I am not infected by the Apple pug, but I put that sticker on that there box.

663
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:42,060
Speaker 1: Frank has an Apple guitar.

664
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,804
Speaker 0: No, he doesn't Gibson guitar.

665
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,168
Speaker 0: it's got an Apple sticker on it.

666
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:48,533
Speaker 0: What why?

667
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:49,275
Speaker 1: I don't know.

668
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:51,343
Speaker 1: I don't know I can't tell you.

669
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,379
Speaker 0: I you know, his people are getting Apple tattoos.

670
00:42:55,082 --> 00:42:57,030
Speaker 1: Now that's too fast too far.

671
00:42:57,592 --> 00:43:01,546
Speaker 1: You see if you come back here with no Tattoo no, it's not gonna happen.

672
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:03,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll be trouble.

673
00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:06,100
Speaker 1: I'd expect to be kicked out for that to be perfectly honest.

674
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,237
Speaker 0: But oh, yeah, you know, yeah, I'm glad you've realized what's coming to you before so you've got.

675
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:12,180
Speaker 1: no I wouldn't do it.

676
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:19,232
Speaker 1: I don't want that because the moment I get it done is the moment they bring out the I poo and Stock prices crash through the floor.

677
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:19,775
Speaker 1: and that's it.

678
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:20,439
Speaker 0: That's it.

679
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:24,876
Speaker 1: Although I think they could actually bring out the I poo and it would sell in its millions.

680
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:31,172
Speaker 1: just to poo in a box With an Apple logo on Probably would people wouldn't buy one and people would dismantle it and go.

681
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,723
Speaker 1: there's clues to the new Apple phone in the firmware of the I poo, but

682
00:43:34,763 --> 00:43:44,200
Speaker 0: the interesting thing is that before you bought it we drive 45 miles to the nearest Apple store for you to look at it in that glass box

683
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,300
Speaker 1: and

684
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:48,173
Speaker 0: Fawn over it until you've got enough money to afford

685
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:48,294
Speaker 1: it.

686
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:52,788
Speaker 1: It's not my fault That the only Apple store is 45 miles away.

687
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,332
Speaker 0: It's the fawning.

688
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,435
Speaker 0: It's not the journey.

689
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:57,300
Speaker 1: Okay, it's on the other side of the pen lines.

690
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,605
Speaker 0: I have no money in my pocket.

691
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:01,555
Speaker 0: I want deeply what is in that store.

692
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:02,820
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna go and stroke one.

693
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,180
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go stroke it.

694
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look at it fawn and then walk away and go and have a look in game see what secondhand games have got.

695
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that's your other geek spot on that trip.

696
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:22,248
Speaker 1: That's half over because that was part of a quest to find an Xbox version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 And you've got a very old game.

697
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:30,180
Speaker 1: and are you telling me now that oh, yeah The quest is half over but as soon as I get a copy of fusion frenzy, we can all relax?

698
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:36,779
Speaker 0: Are you telling me that when you've got fusion frenzy the frequency of your visits into not one?

699
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,951
Speaker 0: Branch two branches of game with two branches of game in the same mall Are going to reduce?

700
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:45,964
Speaker 1: yes, I promise You promise.

Speaker 0: did you hear that everyone everyone?

Speaker 0: This is being recorded on the 7th of all.

703
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:53,886
Speaker 1: Don't be so Yeah, I promise.

704
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:56,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll stop reading my daily news.

Speaker 1: to the point where when I went to the Apple store last time to get my iPod sorted Which is another thing we'll talk about.

713
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:36,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I said to the guy behind the counter, you know I should get commission for all the max I sold and he looked at me In the most deadpan way and said have you any idea how many times I hear that every day?

719
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:02,608
Speaker 1: That since January I have had three.

720
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:07,120

722
00:46:11,052 --> 00:46:13,500

Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know what it does.

735
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,379
Speaker 1: I don't think it's simply using them.

736
00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:00,804
Speaker 1: That does it.

737
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,914
Speaker 1: First of all, I don't think it actually pleases that many people.

738
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:10,306
Speaker 1: I think you know as even rimming Scott have said There's massive problems there.

739
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:14,139

00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:25,855
Speaker 1: I mean when we were using Andy's MacBook yesterday when he put it away.

745
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:27,320
Speaker 1: Did you feel how hot the kitchen?

746
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,494
Speaker 1: You could have just fried an egg on the work Something out of Ghostbusters.

747
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:33,359
Speaker 1: You could have just done that.

748
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,255
Speaker 0: I don't know how long you've been using it for but it can't be however long.

749
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:38,600
Speaker 1: that was ridiculous.

750
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:42,379
Speaker 1: If that had been on your lap, you'd have been rubbing some aloe vera on there.

751
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:45,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, and believe you me that can lead to some nasty injuries.

752
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,999
Speaker 1: If I had to pick an area of my body to burn my lap wouldn't be it?

753
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:54,820
Speaker 0: Well, your testicles are such a great area to be heating up anyway.

754
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,900
Speaker 1: That's the age-old thing about laptops about they make you sterile and stuff like that?

755
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:01,086
Speaker 1: I don't believe they do.

756
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:07,042
Speaker 1: but the Mac book will fry your nuts right there and then I Mean the one.

757
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:12,040
Speaker 0: one thing about that area of the body is it's outside for a reason to cool it down.

758
00:48:12,301 --> 00:48:14,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, last thing you want to do is heat it up.

759
00:48:15,077 --> 00:48:15,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

760
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:21,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, if Steve Jobs came to the door now and said I'll give you this Mac book But I'm gonna have to take a listen away.

761
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:21,952
Speaker 0: You twat me.

762

00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:29,680
Speaker 0: but you would when he Really straight swap me for a MacBook Pro?

766
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, my book Pro.

767
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:36,260
Speaker 1: I mean if it was just a Mac book, I'd want a big hard.

768
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:39,231
Speaker 1: This is I wouldn't really swap you.

769
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:39,995

00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I tell you what, I can predict a couple of things.

Speaker 0: I can predict what he's gonna wear.

823
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,605
Speaker 1: That's it's becoming a game now.

824
00:52:12,705 --> 00:52:13,808
Speaker 1: It's like this big thing.

825
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,993
Speaker 1: I should do a website right here.

826
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,096
Speaker 1: is we we?

827
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:25,920
Speaker 1: we Wait, every time there's a big Apple event coming out people can post their like top three what I think is gonna happen.

828
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:27,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then the winner gets a prize.

829
00:52:29,185 --> 00:52:29,939
Speaker 1: That's crap idea.

830
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:32,264
Speaker 0: Fund a prize.

831
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:33,007
Speaker 0: That's a rubbish.

832
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:37,762
Speaker 1: Well, we get lots of hits and we make I don't know Forget it.

833
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,227
Speaker 0: Okay, we could make a prize.

834
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:40,551
Speaker 0: I suppose rubbish.

835
00:52:40,651 --> 00:52:43,380
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, that's when my broken iPod.

836
00:52:45,481 --> 00:53:05,591
Speaker 0: That's what you do though, I can remember I was racing back from your parents house To see the keynote live because you didn't want to wait for it and then we got back and because every Geek in the world was sat streaming the same piece of video We got about three seconds at a time before it cut again,

837
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,700
Speaker 1: but I sat there for four hours watching those three seconds of the time

838
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:13,514
Speaker 0: By the time we'd seen it it had been reported.

839
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:14,538
Speaker 0: we could have just read it.

840
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,697
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it's reported quicker than you get the video.

841
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:21,180
Speaker 1: now You can read a live blog faster than they put the video.

842
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:26,520
Speaker 1: The thing that frustrates me is that when a new thing comes out you want to hear it on the video?

843
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:28,039
Speaker 1: You want to see Steve go?

844
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:29,659
Speaker 1: Oh, and there is one more thing.

845
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:36,423
Speaker 1: But by the time the videos out you've got to go to the website to get it and they've put the new thing on the front Page of the website.

846
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:42,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you've got to sort of not look at the screen and try and hit the button To go to the video page.

847
00:53:49,283 --> 00:54:02,500
Speaker 1: If you were going to a website to watch a TV episode and on the front page of the Website was the last scene of the film Watch the first episode of 24. in the last episode Jack died.

848
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,247
Speaker 1: It would be pointless.

849
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:05,733
Speaker 1: It's like I'm not gonna mother.

850
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,059
Speaker 1: so that's what it is.

851
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:11,859
Speaker 1: But we still watch and I've watched many of them several times and even old ones.

852
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,685
Speaker 1: I know and I don't know why.

853
00:54:13,705 --> 00:54:16,854
Speaker 0: you like his style as well as much as you hear.

854
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:19,603
Speaker 0: you enjoy hearing him talk about his Thing.

855
00:54:19,743 --> 00:54:20,666
Speaker 0: you enjoy style.

856
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,813
Speaker 1: you like his present love him or hate him.

857
00:54:23,315 --> 00:54:25,020
Speaker 1: The man is a fantastic presenter.

858
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,620
Speaker 1: He does well on stage.

859
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,058
Speaker 1: Yeah More rumors surrounding the clicky thing.

860
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:34,680
Speaker 1: Apparently it's not an actual clicky thing.

861
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:45,494
Speaker 1: Apparently it goes to a room behind the stage that switches a light on that says you switch that thing over now or That's just upsetting because I really wanted the clicky thing to be a real thing.

862
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:46,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not.

863
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:46,960
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

864
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:55,488
Speaker 1: I think you see some people say there was one he did where it broke Yeah, and he had to make a joke about Apple.

865
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:56,491
Speaker 1: doesn't make the clicker thing.

866
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:57,213
Speaker 1: Whatever.

867
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:58,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know.

868
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:00,947
Speaker 0: so Let's go back.

869
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,260
Speaker 1: You know, we've talked about this for half an hour now.

870
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:06,719
Speaker 1: We haven't really discovered anything new other than I hate myself.

871
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:09,787
Speaker 0: I'll tell you one thing that did elevate you though.

872
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,017
Speaker 0: You didn't go whole hog with the old Apple thing.

873
00:55:13,037 --> 00:55:15,518
Speaker 0: You didn't get that crappy phone.

874
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:18,126
Speaker 1: That oh the iTunes phone.

Speaker 0: so, you know completely suckered.

878
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:26,758
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sat here surrounded by a power Mac and an eyesight and an iPod in there.

879
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:28,793
Speaker 1: Actually, you know, that's it.

00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:41,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want me to get an iMac more than I want to get an iMac.

884
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,040
Speaker 1: It's easier if everybody's using the same.

885
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,612
Speaker 0: Completely agree with you, but I am pointing out a fact here.

886
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,520
Speaker 0: You want it for me more than I want.

887
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,909

888
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:57,099
Speaker 1: Is that I chat is an incredible instant messenger program.

889
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:03,720

890
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,428

893
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:14,470
Speaker 0: Right, if I got it we could.

894
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:18,519
Speaker 1: and if we're in the same room Well, not just for you, but when I'm away and stuff.

895
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:20,067
Speaker 0: So you can speak to Tristan my dad.

896
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:30,649
Speaker 1: and So the plan is if I get everyone that I know on to a Mac then we can all use I chat and I don't Have to have stupid MSM messenger.

897
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,780
Speaker 0: That's so much cheaper than MSM message.

898
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,694
Speaker 1: We are like the only country in the world where MSM messenger is a big thing.

899
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:39,880
Speaker 1: no one uses it in America.

900
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:47,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all they're all on aim on AOL and stuff which is why I chat works in America because everyone's on AOL.

901
00:56:47,952 --> 00:56:50,740
Speaker 1: Okay, but here MSM and it sucks ass.

902
00:56:52,602 --> 00:56:54,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't use it on MSN.

903
00:56:54,249 --> 00:56:54,590
Speaker 0: Can you?

904
00:56:54,751 --> 00:56:57,040
Speaker 1: I can use MSM but it's like the most basic.

905
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:02,488
Speaker 1: So we have to do Skype for video to video thing.

906
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:04,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not even seen that working.

907
00:57:04,374 --> 00:57:04,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually.

908
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:07,829
Speaker 1: No, no Should we wrap up?

909
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,299

Speaker 1: should we give a?

913
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,739
Speaker 1: Basically, there's a. there's a list on Craigslist, isn't there of why geeks make of why geeks and nerds are worth it?

914
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,926
Speaker 1: That's a very long URL to give out.

915
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:46,327
Speaker 1: it is but if you do it, I'm sure if you google why geeks and nerds are worth it Then you'll probably get it.
