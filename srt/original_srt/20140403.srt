1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,624
Speaker 1: It's Thursday April 3rd 2014.

2
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:13,166
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:15,934
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and tonight's on geek nights.

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:21,493
Speaker 1: Whoa Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:26,080
Speaker 1: I Guess more properly the geek nights book club.

6
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:31,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah it is so uh warm today.

7
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:36,502
Speaker 1: Ah So Luxurious.

8
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:42,520
Speaker 0: I was so close to bike only had to wear like a hoodie and not really much coat.

9
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:43,768
Speaker 1: I little as not.

10
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:45,280
Speaker 1: I was like I should bike to work tomorrow.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,060
Speaker 1: Then I went to bed then I woke up and I was like I should bike to work today.

12
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:52,900
Speaker 0: It's right on the borderline where I think you'll be totally cool biking to work.

13
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:57,666
Speaker 0: But since you'd be wearing shorts, and then you go over the bridge You'd be a little cold like not.

14
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:00,034
Speaker 0: you'll make it and then it'll be.

15
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:00,717
Speaker 0: it's like it's.

16
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:01,720
Speaker 0: it's almost.

17
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:02,723
Speaker 0: It's like on that border.

18
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,791
Speaker 0: I have to grant warmer like fuck.

19
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:06,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was significant advantage.

20
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,460
Speaker 1: the Pulaski doesn't really count.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,705
Speaker 1: It's barely a bridge hair.

22
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:10,131
Speaker 0: So no no I had hair.

23
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:15,472
Speaker 1: I could bike now by the time I get to the Williamsburg Bridge, which is the bridge I have to worry about.

24
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,123
Speaker 1: I'm already hot and sweaty from biking Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:21,059
Speaker 1: I don't have a bridge early in my ride only late in the ride.

26
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:27,729
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't bike was that I have not actually looked at my bike Since last time I biked.

27
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,332
Speaker 0: yeah, I need to.

28
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:31,407
Speaker 0: I mean I guess all I really need to do The tires.

29
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:35,391
Speaker 0: I can probably just pump it up and go But I still got to check the brakes and make sure it.

30
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:36,577
Speaker 0: I gotta clean it.

31
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,539
Speaker 1: I got a lube it I actually want to degrease the chain and regrease it.

32
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:41,765
Speaker 0: Do that now.

33
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:43,129
Speaker 1: mine is pretty fucking grody.

34
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,209
Speaker 1: Mmm.

35
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,093
Speaker 0: It's only a year old.

36
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's never been cleaned.

37
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:50,440
Speaker 0: That's Apparently, you know you still have the original grease.

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:59,220
Speaker 0: That's from the when you've got the chain when the bike was new Supposed to not remove that for as long as humanly possible because you can basically never get lubrication better than what came from the factory.

39
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:03,854
Speaker 1: Well, my old mountain bike actually I never lubed it ever in the like 15 years.

40
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:04,636
Speaker 1: I used that bike.

41
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:05,780
Speaker 0: Well, that's too long.

42
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it worked fine.

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,740
Speaker 0: But yeah that lube that come when you buy a brand new bike the chain like comes pre lubed from the factory.

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,815
Speaker 0: Supposedly even on shitty bikes that is like the master lube like the amazing.

45
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,140
Speaker 0: you cannot do better than that.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,620
Speaker 0: So you should basically not clean that off Until like years when you absolutely have to and it's like okay it the master lube has finally stopped working.

47
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,700
Speaker 0: now I have to resort to my you know bottle of whatever.

48
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,380
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we're not gonna do much news because it's the book club.

49
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:55,026
Speaker 1: but I just want to point out because it's kind of breaking news that Pax East which after the Boston bombings did not have to go through the security theater that anime Boston was forced to go through as of 2014 is now inexplicably and suddenly being forced to go through the ridiculous Intrusive bag checks at every entrance.

50
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,514
Speaker 0: Oh, well, that's gonna be real bad.

51
00:02:57,674 --> 00:02:59,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see how it goes.

52
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:01,778
Speaker 1: Not too excited about it.

53
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:09,730
Speaker 1: The only thing I can really say about this is that if you're mad you should complain to the city of Boston Like you should actually email the mayor of Boston.

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,660
Speaker 0: I mean actually this, you know, we all know it's security theater, right?

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,959
Speaker 0: We don't need to talk about that again for the 10 billionth time.

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,459
Speaker 0: This is so obviously a scam to basically quote create jobs, right?

57
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,409
Speaker 1: Yep So I mean it's because the city provides these people.

58
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,493
Speaker 1: there's tons of them.

59
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:27,280
Speaker 1: None of them want to be there.

60
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,896
Speaker 1: I remember one lady when she was checking my bag at anime Boston Was going through the motions cuz her manager was there and she kept saying to me.

61
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,383
Speaker 1: I'm so sorry I'm sorry.

62
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:35,065
Speaker 1: I have to do this.

63
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:35,406
Speaker 1: Really.

64
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,108
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm sorry.

65
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,199
Speaker 1: She kept saying that everyone she was checking the bags for they know.

66
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,249
Speaker 1: So yeah, this sucks.

67
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:49,920
Speaker 1: The only thing I can say is that Pax Prime is literally in every way objectively superior to Pax East at this point.

68
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:52,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Pax East I'm gonna see it's gonna be hilarious.

69
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:58,653
Speaker 0: So a few thousand people are gonna try to get in on Friday at 10 a.m To go to the keynote, right?

70
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:06,748
Speaker 0: As far as I can see Waiting in the security line and then they're going to go up to the real line and While the keynote is.

71
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,306
Speaker 0: if the keynote starts on time The room might not even be full.

72
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:15,379
Speaker 0: people might still be in the security line and then as soon as they get through running to The keynote and getting there while it's in progress.

73
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:23,240
Speaker 1: I also predict that unlike Pax Prime Pax East basically no attendees are in a hotel that's connected to the convention center.

74
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:26,440
Speaker 1: That shit was sold out before the hotels went live.

75
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:34,864
Speaker 1: So the vast majority of the people attending Pax East are walking to the convention from far away or taking a shuttle From far away.

76
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,600
Speaker 1: They're all gonna have bags and there's more people there than anime Boston.

77
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:41,920
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's gonna be disaster.

78
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:48,910
Speaker 0: They're all people who want to get in immediately as soon as the thing opens either for the keynote or the dealers for hall Exhibition room.

79
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,203
Speaker 1: Yep, a Couple.

80
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,339
Speaker 1: all that with the fact that there's really only two entrances.

81
00:04:54,002 --> 00:05:07,615
Speaker 0: But actually because people don't meander in and out of the Pax East a whole lot during the day Like once they get that line through it should actually be okay, but then once people leave at night They ain't coming back which I already weren't coming back because of the hour decrease.

82
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:08,860
Speaker 0: They're really not coming back.

83
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:12,600
Speaker 1: Pax ends at midnight and I get dinner at 8 p.m I'm not going back.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,724
Speaker 1: Well, I am cuz I'm.

85
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:14,205
Speaker 1: I have to.

86
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,129
Speaker 0: I'm enforcing.

87
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,076
Speaker 1: my enforcer shift is the entire con.

88
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:17,778
Speaker 1: I'm not.

89
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:18,983
Speaker 0: well I'm enforcing.

90
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,410
Speaker 0: I hopefully I picked the night shift.

91
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:20,892
Speaker 0: We'll see.

92
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah.

93
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:25,950
Speaker 1: so Not super excited about this.

94
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:34,360
Speaker 1: I hate to say it, but Probably wouldn't attend Pax East if I weren't a guest speaker and or an enforcer that goes for pretty much every convention.

95
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,134
Speaker 1: I would go to Pax Prime if I was just an attendee.

96
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:40,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure I would go to mag fest if I was just an attendee.

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,315
Speaker 1: Well, obviously those are probably the only two major cons I'd go to if I was just an attendee.

98
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:49,497
Speaker 0: to be perfectly blunt I might go to kinetic on if I was cuz you know what.

99
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:51,807
Speaker 0: I would go to Just an attendee of kinetic on.

100
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:52,449
Speaker 0: you know what I could do.

101
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,172
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

102
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,055
Speaker 1: I'd play fucking game.

103
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:54,919
Speaker 0: Oh, man, right?

104
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,276
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I would go to kinetic on if I was just an attendee even though I've never done that cuz.

105
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:03,478
Speaker 0: I've always been a guest Or staff or something, but we have gone to kinetic cons where he didn't have much to do.

106
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,519
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, we were in panels, but that was it.

107
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:23,592
Speaker 1: Well, there was that one year but way back where we showed up not knowing if we had panels tricked the staff into giving us badges as guests and then we looked through the schedule found that they had scheduled all the same panels that we did the previous year that year without Telling us and then proceeded to show up in front all those panels.

108
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:37,528
Speaker 1: kinetic ons come a long way guys But yeah, that's neither here nor there geek nights book club, but first things of the day.

109
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,236
Speaker 0: So there's this guy.

110
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:42,306
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what the context of this video is.

111
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:44,715
Speaker 1: it doesn't really matter It is bikes.

112
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:49,250
Speaker 0: I think this guy is like an important person or maybe famous or something and I just don't know him.

113
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,173
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to figure it out.

114
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,219
Speaker 0: Let's see being interviewed by someone or something.

115
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,266
Speaker 0: I don't know Tyler the Creator.

116
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,612

118
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,043
Speaker 0: He's just not as somebody that I know.

119
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:02,410
Speaker 0: the point is whoever's interviewing him, right?

120
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,690
Speaker 0: I guess ask him something.

121
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,841
Speaker 0: But the video does not contain the question only contains the answer.

122

Speaker 0: and this is the greatest advice Regarding bicycles that I've ever heard in my entire life.

00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:32,688
Speaker 1: It's called the expert Mmm, and I will say this this is a hundred percent too real.

153
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:47,756
Speaker 1: I Real I have been the most real in meetings that if you literally take this exact conversation and just I didn't so many of these meetings just replace the proper nouns with TCP IP and Servers and shared objects.

154
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:56,708
Speaker 1: It is literally the same meeting right down to Exactly what the executives say the body language of the executives the.

155
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,540
Speaker 1: well Let's not lose track of the big picture here.

156
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:02,030
Speaker 1: We have a task that's set before us.

157
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:05,521
Speaker 1: Those exact words have been said to me dozens of times.

158
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,169
Speaker 0: I've been in this exact meeting many times.

159
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:16,750
Speaker 1: So if you want to know what the jobs of people like me and Scott are like when we have when we have a meeting When we have a meeting with someone who is not a technical person.

160
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:20,770
Speaker 1: It is it is literally this and I know what you're gonna think when you're watching this video.

161
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:24,102
Speaker 1: You're no one that you yourself if I were in that room.

162
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:25,828
Speaker 1: I would quit and walk the fuck out.

163
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:29,216
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah That's happened.

164
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've done that.

165
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:37,047
Speaker 1: I've seen people in meetings like this quit their jobs in said meetings.

166
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:43,167
Speaker 0: that actually What I do in this in meeting situation is you know, it's like the guy sort of caves in.

167
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,713
Speaker 0: he's like, I'm you know I can do anything.

168
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:47,044
Speaker 0: I'm an expert where I'm like, no he didn't.

169
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:47,847
Speaker 1: that was obviously.

170
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:54,833
Speaker 0: he's Sarcastic and he's checked obviously, but what I do is I'm like, no really really I like.

171
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,762
Speaker 0: I basically try to make that the other.

172
00:09:56,802 --> 00:10:00,650
Speaker 0: I turn it on them to make them seem He went and then people don't like me.

173
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,192
Speaker 0: But that's not.

174
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:07,010
Speaker 1: he went through all the stages that the engineer goes through including trying to use stupid back at stupid.

175
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,082
Speaker 1: He's like, well, I'm gonna draw the other six with transparent ink.

176
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:12,165
Speaker 1: How's that?

177
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,369
Speaker 1: I'm doing it right now.

178
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:21,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you cringe while watching this welcome to the corporate world reality This is what's real.

179
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,790
Speaker 0: It's a stone-cold dose of fucking real if you're like in college and you're getting ready to go enter the job world.

180
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:31,430
Speaker 0: Just be ready Once you have a job and you're a smart person.

181
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:36,425
Speaker 0: That is what the job will be like when you have to communicate with people who are dumbasses.

182
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:38,050
Speaker 0: now guys know anything about technology.

183
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,320
Speaker 1: I want to say something else because this isn't Monday geek nights.

184
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,324
Speaker 1: It's Thursday geek nights.

185
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:55,937
Speaker 1: I don't know who the fuck you are but if you watch this video and you've been in meetings that are of this nature like a technologist and the salespeople and the stakeholders and all that business and You're one of the people other than the engineer

186
00:10:56,017 --> 00:11:00,170
Speaker 0: right like an you're in a meeting and an engineer told you that's not and that's impossible.

187
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,052
Speaker 0: that can't be done.

188
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:08,449
Speaker 1: like if you could envision a meeting like this where you're not the engineer and You don't think that meetings went this way.

189
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:09,956
Speaker 1: You're wrong.

190
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:12,246
Speaker 1: that meeting went this way and you're the problem.

191
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,250
Speaker 0: You are the problem.

192
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:16,603
Speaker 0: You don't deserve your job or whatever monies you have.

193
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:18,089
Speaker 0: you should go back to school.

194
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,278
Speaker 0: I go back to school right now.

195
00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:22,764
Speaker 1: This is way too real.

196
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:23,869
Speaker 0: This is the most real.

197
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,401
Speaker 1: In the better moment the book club book was wool.

198
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:32,462
Speaker 0: we're talking about it right the fuck now This weekend when they chose the wool or were you the one that shows?

199
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:37,070
Speaker 1: I chose the wool because too many people gave me free Copies, I do have a sign free copy.

200
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:42,584
Speaker 0: I haven't chosen anything else yet because I didn't realize I had to do something.

201
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:45,130
Speaker 0: No, I'll choose something for the next episode.

202
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:46,338
Speaker 1: That's fine.

00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:57,029
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't say we know a lot of people in the place where we live.

206
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:05,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no a lot of people who don't live here are here because it's the mocha fact because it's New York City Mocha fest is this goddamn weekend.

207
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:06,001

00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,629
Speaker 0: That's the only place to eat and then go to the hotel.

215
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:43,570
Speaker 1: Get a space to game and don't fucking give up that space for anything for the rest of the night.

255
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:32,309
Speaker 1: So well, I picked will as a book literally because So many people gave me free copies of it and a bunch of people were talking about it on the internet.

256
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:38,595
Speaker 1: Either it was gonna be good Which is awesome or it was gonna be another King killer chronicle.

257
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:42,270
Speaker 1: captain penis fucks his way through being a nice guy in a fantasy world.

258
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,270
Speaker 0: Well, I mean anything in the world is either good or bad.

259
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:52,050
Speaker 0: Yeah But but not just bad but bad enough to where I'm actually what there was no chance of it being slightly bad or just mediocre.

260
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:54,147
Speaker 0: It was either gonna be amazing or crap.

261
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:54,913
Speaker 1: There was no.

262
00:14:54,973 --> 00:15:01,245
Speaker 1: someone tweeted at me recently and they said something like man The King killer chronicle really shat in your Cheerios didn't it?

263
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,450
Speaker 1: and I was like, you know what?

264
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:07,470
Speaker 0: Kind of did but yeah, no, I mean whenever something is ridiculously popular, right?

265
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,929
Speaker 0: Some nerds have a reaction where they don't even know anything about it.

266
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:26,448
Speaker 0: yet All they know is that thing over there is ridiculously popular and that either makes them Want to check it out super hardcore or if they're a different kind of nerd it makes them want, you know Immediately judge it to be shitty and mainstream or too popular and they completely, you know Say it sucks even though they're nothing about it yet, right?

267
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:35,974
Speaker 0: There tends to be a lot of nerds that do that Whereas for me when I see something that's ridiculously popular I go Mmm, and I don't.

268
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:44,320
Speaker 0: I don't necessarily say that sucks cuz it's not you know, most of the time it's it's not complete garbage Right, very few things are ridiculously bad, right?

269
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,749
Speaker 0: Oh Dean comes across once a century, right?

270
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,860
Speaker 0: But I don't immediately like jump on board either right?

271
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:54,150
Speaker 0: I'm always just skeptical like why is that thing?

272
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,260
Speaker 0: So popular?

273
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,390
Speaker 1: we'll do a little bit of research.

274
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:00,020
Speaker 0: Why am I seeing this so frequently?

275
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,688
Speaker 0: right before I even read wool I saw someone on the train on the subway Reading shift which is the sequel and I was like, huh?

276
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,075
Speaker 1: Which apparently we were told is shit.

277
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:11,620
Speaker 0: What's up with that?

278
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:26,671
Speaker 1: So, yeah And like I said, the anecdote was I was given a free copy by two different people And we got a free copy when he went to some charity dinner in like the goodie bag Yep, so I had all these free copies.

279
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:34,271
Speaker 1: So and So all that last I'm gonna say this one last time guys, it's a book club.

280
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,119
Speaker 1: we're talking about it assuming you already read it.

281
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,593
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna summarize the plot.

282
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,887
Speaker 1: We're gonna spoil Everything and there's a lot to spoil.

283
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,471
Speaker 0: and this is one of those books where it's like.

284
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,320
Speaker 0: it looks physically large like large paper.

285
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:49,227
Speaker 1: No, it takes like a few days.

286
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,953
Speaker 0: it takes like no time to read this book.

287
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:51,816
Speaker 0: the text is big.

288
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:52,720
Speaker 0: it reads really fast.

289
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:56,629
Speaker 1: So if you haven't read it yet Stop listening and go read the book.

290
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,040
Speaker 1: the whole point of the book club is that you've read the book.

291
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,568
Speaker 0: We're trying to make you read a book.

292
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:15,755
Speaker 1: We're trying to enjoy that experience That is so rare where you and all your friends all saw the same movie or read the same book and then you talk about It like the last several months of Kill La Kill So wool, uh, I liked it actually.

293
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:16,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's okay.

294
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,119
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, I said this on a previous episode, right but might as well compact it.

295
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:38,844
Speaker 0: You know reiterate myself for anyone who's just listening to this when I first read like page one, two, three I'm immediately thinking of you know, Logan's run Fallout paranoia RPG all those I'm like, this is another one of those and I'm like, well, that's kind of good I like those.

296
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:44,387
Speaker 1: those are things I'm down with and there aren't that many of those that have Multiple of those in the same story.

297
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:48,260
Speaker 1: that paranoia is usually just paranoia Brazil is usually just Brazil.

298
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,587
Speaker 0: Brazil doesn't have the see.

299
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:51,791
Speaker 0: this is more specific than that.

300
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:51,992
Speaker 0: right.

301
00:17:52,052 --> 00:18:12,325
Speaker 0: Logan's run paranoia and fallout all have Not just the sort of post-apocalypse weird society issue Which also Brazil has yeah, but it they also have the specific thing of people Locked in to a place right where the entire society is enclosed sealed in Phoenix Phoenix volume 2.

302
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:20,866
Speaker 1: future also has them within that space like the paranoia side The people are color-coded in some fashion and don't Right, but any.

303
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:24,498
Speaker 0: well, there was some intermingling at least in wool, but it was superficial.

304
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:25,240
Speaker 1: That's kind of the point.

305
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Speaker 0: So on the one hand I'm like that is that is a trope a story mechanic that I like a kind of story that oh Wow, Wikipedia fucking spoils it immediately, right?

306
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:36,800
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, right?

307
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,172
Speaker 0: Immediately, I'm also giving it minus points in the first few pages.

308
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:44,510
Speaker 0: cuz I'm like, oh it's just ripping off Paranoia fallout etc.

309
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:44,792
Speaker 0: Right?

310
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:49,640
Speaker 0: So on the one hand it's like, okay It's another one of those things that I like that I've seen so often.

311
00:18:50,242 --> 00:19:00,412
Speaker 0: But it's another one of those right plus and minus from the get-go, but then I realized something After like chapter 2 I'm like, you know, let's let's think about this for a second.

312
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:12,039
Speaker 0: Logan's run right fallout paranoia the RPG Phoenix volume 2 Those are fucking obscure things only nerds know about.

313
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,447
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe Logan's run.

314
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:21,974
Speaker 1: Well, maybe if you've never read a like a lot of fantasy fiction You might read Game of Thrones and think oh my god.

315
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:22,840
Speaker 1: It's so serious.

316
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,207
Speaker 0: Maybe Logan's run.

317
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:27,214
Speaker 0: a normal non nerd would know about.

318
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:31,640
Speaker 1: it has to be a normal non Nerd who's also kind of old at this point, right?

319
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,130
Speaker 0: It's like the things that tell this story.

320
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:44,933
Speaker 0: this story has been told at least five six times before But every place the story has been told is in an obscure nerdy You know media that only people like us even know about.

321
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:49,647
Speaker 0: they're super popular among people like us But among the general populace of the world.

322
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:55,210
Speaker 0: this story has not really been told in pop culture outside of Logan's run Which isn't that popular?

323
00:19:55,371 --> 00:20:01,120
Speaker 0: Yep, so This is like hey, you know, I saw people reading this shit on the subway.

324
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:04,713
Speaker 0: This is introducing that story that it to them.

325
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,664
Speaker 0: This seems unique and amazing and original Right.

326
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:11,583
Speaker 0: I don't know if the author of this, you know borrowed or came up with the idea I do.

327
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:15,985
Speaker 1: if this guy has never heard of any of those things I'm kind of amazed at his.

328
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:21,500
Speaker 0: well supposedly Harry Potter lady never read any, you know book of magic or whatever.

329
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:22,690
Speaker 1: I could see that though.

330
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,456
Speaker 0: I don't know.

331
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,529
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah what?

332
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:30,187
Speaker 0: so and and supposedly What's it called Hunger Games?

333
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:36,159
Speaker 0: never read battle royale or knew it existed Right, but you wouldn't believe it unless you know.

334
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,670
Speaker 1: There's one thing that you might not realize out there that you probably should.

335
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,820
Speaker 1: this was written as sort of a series of short stories.

336
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:44,147
Speaker 1: It's not.

337
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,600
Speaker 1: it wasn't originally a single book, right?

338
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,320
Speaker 0: So the wall guy so the book that we got that was just wool is actually like five books.

339
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,599
Speaker 1: It's five books, but really it's three books.

340
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:57,540
Speaker 1: One though, you know the first guy and again last warning fucking spoilers.

341
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,551
Speaker 0: That's up until the the mayor dies is book one, right?

342
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:04,084
Speaker 1: No book one is up until the first cleaner We see dies.

343
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:06,153
Speaker 0: That's like not long at all.

344
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:06,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's book one.

345
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,063
Speaker 0: That's like four pages You know what?

346
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:14,878
Speaker 1: I really like book one because book one Reminded me in every way of what is not even a book as a pamphlet.

347
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,891
Speaker 1: You know what it is It's a Ray Bradbury short story.

348
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,080
Speaker 0: Yeah book one is a pamphlet.

349
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,820
Speaker 1: It's even in the style of a Ray Bradbury short story.

350
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,987
Speaker 1: I mean look it sets up.

351
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,675
Speaker 1: Oh, but you know, it sets up this world really quickly.

352
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:30,694
Speaker 1: It sends him out there like oh He wants like a tent like he wants to go for a clean Twilight Zone episode.

353
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:31,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but explains the deal.

354
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:33,720
Speaker 1: He's convinced that you know.

355
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,360
Speaker 1: His wife went out there because she learned that they had the technology to make the screen show whatever it wanted.

356
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,449
Speaker 1: She's like, oh they pulled the wool over her eyes.

357
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,352
Speaker 1: The screens a fake.

358
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,160
Speaker 1: She went out there didn't come back.

359
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:47,011
Speaker 1: So he's like, I know that she knew something.

360
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:49,200
Speaker 1: I know the screen can fake it.

361
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,303
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go out there.

362
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:51,989
Speaker 1: Holy fuck the world's awesome.

363
00:21:52,350 --> 00:22:04,260
Speaker 1: Oh wait, they can fake it but wrong screen Mm-hmm, and that ending where he pot, you know You think he pops the mask off and then he just fucking dies out in the wilderness in the toxic air.

364
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was great.

365
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:11,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not gonna say I didn't see it coming But I didn't see the fullness of it coming.

366
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:13,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't see the.

367
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:14,574
Speaker 0: you know the.

368
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:29,063
Speaker 0: you know it's like you're reading the description of the screen over the face and it's like I only had to read two words of that description before Completely grok the whole situation right and then like it felt like when I'm reading the rest of those paragraphs like yep Yep, I already got it.

369
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,284
Speaker 0: Yep.

370
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:34,180
Speaker 0: Yep, you know, but I didn't get it before like the first two words of that paragraph.

371
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:35,499
Speaker 0: Yep, it's weird like that.

372
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,472
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you sort of you feel like you figured it.

373
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,880
Speaker 0: you didn't figure it out actually in advance, right?

374
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:47,817
Speaker 0: But you figured it out basically Right before Actually reading it like at that moment.

375
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:48,140
Speaker 0: It's weird.

376
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,199
Speaker 0: It's almost like your brain has already read the rest of the words in the page But you still haven't read the rest of the words in the page.

377
00:22:53,481 --> 00:23:04,720
Speaker 1: But all I could think was that whole system seems clever because just knowing that from the beginning part of the book All right Anyone who expresses a desire to leave is probably gonna be a problem in a society like this.

378
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:07,599
Speaker 1: So set up a system that guarantees they'll go die.

379
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:11,600
Speaker 1: But then why have this ridiculous that's over?

380
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:20,510
Speaker 0: After I read that first book one, I guess technically right as soon as I finished it I was like, aha Aha, so many questions have been answered right away.

381
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:21,273
Speaker 0: very interesting.

382
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:22,979
Speaker 0: and then I'm like, but why?

383
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:26,960
Speaker 1: yeah It's like that you could just fucking shoot those people and say don't fucking go outside.

384
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:32,220
Speaker 0: Why you know, why do you have to lie to someone who's going to be dead any second?

385
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,437
Speaker 1: Well, obviously you could think it's to trick them into doing the cleaning anyway, but would that get?

386
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:38,400
Speaker 1: why not cleaning?

387
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:44,320
Speaker 1: Why not just fake the screen not needing cleaning and just kill people who break the rules?

388
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:45,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't.

389
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:46,909
Speaker 0: it didn't make a lot of.

390
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:51,938
Speaker 1: so why don't I just fake them doing the cleaning and just have them all go out There and die they can't get back in.

391
00:23:52,423 --> 00:23:54,340
Speaker 0: You don't need to show the real outside world.

392
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,405
Speaker 0: You can just show some fake outside world that you've curated with your computers and then anyone who goes into that room You just incinerate them into dust.

393
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:05,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you just animated a person going out of them going out and cleaning.

394
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I don't know.

395
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:12,180
Speaker 1: so it was interesting that book two started and then just killed all those characters, too.

396
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:14,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that a lot actually.

397
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:15,814
Speaker 0: Well, I liked it in that we got to.

398
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:21,980
Speaker 0: you know You read like an Ursula manga right and he constantly introduces a new character and then makes you care about them.

399
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, right But they're never there.

400
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:28,165
Speaker 0: all these side characters that he makes you care about for like a minute and then he moves around a whole Bunch here.

401
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:31,000
Speaker 0: It's sort of similar introduce a new character make you care about it.

402
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:40,380
Speaker 0: I like that because there's more characters to care about and you end up caring about them But they're all main characters and then they kill them and then they introduce you another one and that you care about that.

403
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,473
Speaker 0: Why - after book - and you're not like.

404
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:43,540
Speaker 0: I'll bring back the old one.

405
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:49,260
Speaker 1: No Like after book one just because the the plot seems so sort of over complicated.

406
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,440
Speaker 1: Now I thought of that as being minus points, but then after didn't see it's another complicated.

407
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:57,438
Speaker 1: Well, no, no, no, not the plot of the book the plot of the screen.

408
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,322
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Contrived like.

409
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:01,749
Speaker 1: really you're gonna have a super complicated like.

410
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:02,791
Speaker 1: right, right.

411
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:10,580
Speaker 1: Okay, but then after book two, I Like the sort of when you say you start to figure out that actually it is a lot more complicated.

412
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
Speaker 1: I actually really got invested in what the fuck was going on with this world.

413
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:20,279
Speaker 1: Well, I mean because it has this theme that was kind of subtle of the it's.

414
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:28,420
Speaker 1: again It's always the zebra storyteller that the first characters the initial people who die Got the seed and then went out and died.

415
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:37,126
Speaker 1: They had to be killed before that seed could sprout but a tiny tiny piece of that seed survived Inside of the silo.

416
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:44,900
Speaker 1: someone else found it and otherwise had they not learned about the screens They would have died too, but they learned about the screens.

417
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,670
Speaker 1: But because they started a slightly ahead of everyone else and had a tiny bit more Before they learned that.

418
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,000
Speaker 1: yeah, they learned the resolution.

419
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:59,900
Speaker 1: So when she goes outside there's that moment of oh my god, the visor is XP, you know exit to eight by two inches.

420
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:05,033
Speaker 1: So she knew exactly what the fuck was going on because she'd been primed a tiny bit.

421
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:07,345
Speaker 1: and the look at the overall theme of this book.

422
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:10,739
Speaker 1: Information is the most powerful thing in the world.

423
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:17,599
Speaker 1: having the tiniest tiniest sliver of information a hundred percent changed the outcome of that.

424
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:27,819
Speaker 1: cleaning Juliet instead of dying could a hundred percent save the day and because she shared that with one other person He was able to make the supply thing happen.

425
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:33,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then that everything just cascades from there and information is literally a small not literally.

426
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:35,940
Speaker 1: information is a snowball in these books.

427
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:41,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's something I didn't like about that aspect of the story.

428
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:45,578
Speaker 0: right is that you know information is so powerful Which is why IT sort of ran the show.

429
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:46,945
Speaker 0: The bad guys.

430
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:50,060
Speaker 0: I guess, you know, at least the organization IT was the bad guys.

431
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even though any all the individuals in IT even the baddest guy were Bernard.

432
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,500
Speaker 1: I hated Bernard so much.

433
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:03,791
Speaker 1: But then as he's at least sympathetic at time because he makes that really good point of yes The people who set this up are horrible and evil.

434
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,280
Speaker 0: but what the fuck are we supposed to do instead?

435
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,624
Speaker 1: They already did it.

436
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,351
Speaker 1: They already ruined the world.

437
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:10,556
Speaker 1: And what do you want me to do?

438
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,519
Speaker 1: Let everyone die.

439
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:19,682
Speaker 1: My chance my options are follow through with their plot so that at least someone will survive to rebuild or Fuck it.

440
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:20,805
Speaker 1: Let's just all die.

441
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:24,136
Speaker 1: Right like it's very hard to see another way out for him.

442
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:30,418
Speaker 0: No, no But yeah, I hope that we're gonna see some sideways digging I guess in the future books.

443
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:33,160
Speaker 1: if you read I'm not gonna read the rest of the books because you learn.

444
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:38,977
Speaker 1: Luke Burrage basically said they're literally not worth reading and I trust him a lot.

445
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:39,800
Speaker 0: I trust him also.

446
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, also I read what they're about.

447
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:47,519
Speaker 0: Well, the second one's about silo 1 right which is interesting cuz like you kind of want feel like that.

448
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,291
Speaker 0: Would that's like where all the mysteries are at.

449
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:50,519
Speaker 0: you want to know about that, right?

450
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,975
Speaker 1: Yeah, except it seems to be a prequel and it's about a congressman.

451
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:58,620
Speaker 0: Oh It's not actually about what's happening in silo 1 right now.

452
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,480
Speaker 1: Oh, no, did you actually did you read the afterword in the book the Q&A with the author?

453
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,914
Speaker 1: Yes, where he was like you won't believe what's going on in silo 40.

454
00:28:07,914 --> 00:28:11,132
Speaker 1: It's like really now I really want to know what's going on in silo 40.

455
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:15,700
Speaker 0: I don't care about silo 40 I care about what's happening in silo 1 where the big bad guys are right now.

456
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,998
Speaker 0: That's like knowing what's going on in the Death Star where the Emperor is.

457
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:24,404
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know what's going on and you know, most of the silos made it only what like three Yeah died.

458
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:30,880
Speaker 0: so probably all just carrying on the same way that the wool silo was carrying on Yeah before any bad things happened.

459
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,653
Speaker 1: But that was that was the moment when I did not see coming like.

460
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:42,726
Speaker 1: I expected a lot of things from this book But when she didn't do the cleaning and she walked over the horizon When Bernard was like, oh fuck.

461
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,732
Speaker 1: and then he calls the other silos.

462
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:46,458
Speaker 1: He's like, this is silo 18.

463
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,160
Speaker 1: We got a problem.

464
00:28:47,723 --> 00:29:00,208
Speaker 1: I didn't expect there to be all these other silos Silos really but why I expected there to be other silos and it to be a really sort of Disconnected plot of like they're not to get.

465
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:04,360
Speaker 1: I did not expect the IT departments of all the silos to be in constant communication.

466
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:10,560
Speaker 0: Right, it's because they present right like Bernard and IT of their silo as like the biggest bad.

467
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:21,860
Speaker 0: You couldn't imagine a square boss really like at the square boss you imagined was hiding in the silo right not somewhere else It was sort of like a clever ruse, but it's like I didn't under even at that moment.

468
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,960
Speaker 0: I'm like, why is it such a big deal that she didn't clean and walked over the hill and she'll die over there?

469
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,603
Speaker 0: Who gives a fuck?

470
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:29,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, why is it important that they see her die on the thing?

471
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:32,297
Speaker 0: Why is it a real, you know, you saw?

472
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:35,120
Speaker 1: yeah Why are they engineering the suits the way they did all this stuff?

473
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,070
Speaker 1: like I thought the plot was going to be up before that point.

474
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:55,700
Speaker 1: they engineer the suits to fail because They are evil and they're trying to keep the people in the silo from trying to expand For what you know just so they can maintain their power kind of like in North Korea Mm-hmm, but then you find out that actually no they're trying to maintain all the other North Korea's so that they can all keep going.

475
00:29:56,462 --> 00:30:01,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I guess if the North Korea's all knew about each other they wouldn't be able to keep going.

476
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:15,004
Speaker 1: Well, no the idea is that because look at how dangerous information is and look at how apparently silo 17 like silo 18 Almost had the same thing a little bit of information just cascades into disaster and the silos done Mm-hmm.

477
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:17,071
Speaker 1: So the idea is to segregate the silo.

478
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:19,179
Speaker 1: So if one goes crazy all the rest are fine.

479
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:19,622
Speaker 1: Hmm.

480
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,259
Speaker 0: What do you do if your head of IT is all fucked the fuck up?

481
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:26,038
Speaker 0: You're putting all your eggs in one basket in one silo depends entirely on one person.

482
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:27,506
Speaker 1: Yep That's actually that kind of body.

483
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:30,260
Speaker 0: That's what happened in this particular silo.

484
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,043
Speaker 0: Is it fucked up?

485
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:33,492
Speaker 0: because Bernard fucked up trying to poison.

486
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,560
Speaker 0: he could have just not done that and it would have been just fine.

487
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, if he hadn't poisoned the mayor actually none of this bullshit would have happened, right?

488
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:40,080
Speaker 1: He was just stupid.

489
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:41,086
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

490
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:43,580
Speaker 0: I guess there must have been something in the order that told him to do that.

491
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

492
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:46,029
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

493
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like why.

494
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,099
Speaker 0: why did he do that?

495
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wasn't trying to poison the mayor.

496
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,131
Speaker 0: He was trying to poison the sheriff guy.

497
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:56,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know The second income, but even then why poison him?

498
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,980
Speaker 1: all that's gonna do is raise questions and cause fucking issues.

499
00:31:00,302 --> 00:31:02,820
Speaker 1: Why Russell Jimmy's that can be left on rustled, right?

500
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,265
Speaker 0: I'd like why did he like?

501
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:06,113
Speaker 0: what in the order told him to do that?

502
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:06,836
Speaker 0: Why was that?

503
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:07,820
Speaker 1: also he trusted?

504
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,286
Speaker 1: Let's say he's way too quick.

505
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:09,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

506
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,902
Speaker 0: Well, let's say he had succeeded in Poisoning.

507
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:15,699
Speaker 0: just the second, you know, the the sheriff is great.

508
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:24,000
Speaker 1: So now you have a mayor who's gonna be sad and pissed off and a new sheriff who she trusts Who's gonna be really pissed off and they're gonna investigate the fuck out of that, right?

509
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,580
Speaker 0: It's not that you know, his plan was not a plan that was going to help the silo.

510
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,398
Speaker 0: So I don't understand, you know why he did that or what order suggested.

511
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:31,920
Speaker 0: that was a good one.

512
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:39,379
Speaker 0: I also don't understand is why the silo all the other silo or maybe just letting what's your name the main character?

513
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,761
Speaker 1: Juliette.

514
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:46,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you let Juliette really you forgot I can't the whole subplot about Romeo and Juliet and I remember that now.

515
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:52,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you if you just let Juliette be sheriff would that really have brought about the doom of the silo on its own?

516
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,700
Speaker 1: Or he could have gotten rid of her later if she figured stuff out.

517
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,820
Speaker 0: I mean the sheriff was already bad seed or whatever, right?

518
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:06,199
Speaker 1: So yeah, if he hadn't called her back up to do the cleaning she probably wouldn't have figured any of that shit out, right?

519
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:20,088
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, honestly the only part of this book I did not like is the whole Super long section about her going down to get the pumps going again and then the drama of that failing Oh in the other silo.

520
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:25,840
Speaker 1: Yes, that store that Chapter that like plot was way too long.

521
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,791
Speaker 0: Yeah The pacing of it was was way off and it was cause.

522
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:33,073
Speaker 1: it was happening at the same time as the much more Interesting plot in silo 18.

523
00:32:33,073 --> 00:32:36,529
Speaker 1: Yeah with the revolution I wish that holds like it.

524
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,165
Speaker 1: I think a better editor would have told them to Literally skip over that part.

525
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:46,199
Speaker 1: have her go down be successful with the pump come back up and find a solo knocked out.

526
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:47,948
Speaker 1: Right that should have been like a few.

527
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:54,175
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, they build that up so much They spend all this time building it up and it's like yeah doesn't matter need to build that up.

528
00:32:54,236 --> 00:33:00,869
Speaker 0: diving with like Shoddy diving equipment under all that water is fucking scary You don't need to explain it to me for like two chaff.

529
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,180
Speaker 1: and also she's a goddamn engineer the whole book.

530
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:09,120
Speaker 1: She is like the the the uber engineer and yet she doesn't test this at all doesn't do a test.

531
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:18,040
Speaker 1: If you're gonna give me that level of detail on the production dive Then show her doing the test dives then it makes sense that it failed because she didn't account for something.

532
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,567
Speaker 1: Don't just have her be stupid.

533
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:22,600
Speaker 1: and then have her be stupid for like an entire fucking set of.

534
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:26,732
Speaker 0: And then don't days X the recovery with the air trapped under the stairs and shit.

535
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:28,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, that also wouldn't have worked.

536
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:34,066
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I was just that whole chapter That seriously who edited this book.

537
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:35,792
Speaker 1: that should have been cut anyway.

538
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:36,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was just.

539
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:37,900
Speaker 1: that was just baby's first novel.

540
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:45,596
Speaker 0: The other thing that bothered me slightly about this book was how you know I tease the bad guy and mechanics is the good guy, right?

541
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:49,605
Speaker 0: It's like you it's Where the tones.

542
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:51,149
Speaker 0: were they really the good guy?

543
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,874
Speaker 1: because what was their immediate reaction?

544
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:54,358
Speaker 1: a rabble rabble rabble?

545
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:54,840
Speaker 1: Let's kill it.

546
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:58,273
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is that you know, there there is a luddist tone.

547
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,498
Speaker 0: That is I'm not a fan of.

548
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:02,920
Speaker 1: ah But at the same time they weren't anti technology.

549
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,400
Speaker 1: In fact, they were pro technology and those among them who tried to advance technology got killed.

550
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,620
Speaker 1: Mmm, I mean they were like, why don't we just make more silo guys?

551
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,675
Speaker 0: Well, I mean that heard that's something else that bothered me right?

552
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:17,518
Speaker 0: is, you know You had the one guy who like never left his room.

553
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:20,300
Speaker 0: He seemed to be the only one capable of inventing anything.

554
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,375
Speaker 0: You're telling me this silos been around for I guess century at least they.

555
00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:24,520
Speaker 1: they said that up pretty clearly.

556
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:26,620
Speaker 1: Anyone who tried to invent anything was murdered.

557
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,188
Speaker 0: It's like no one had any inventive abilities.

558
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:32,679
Speaker 1: remember the Juliet's former lover was murdered because he was inventive.

559
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:34,266
Speaker 0: What what did he invent?

560
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:35,371
Speaker 1: He tried he tried.

561
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:37,620
Speaker 1: he figured out a plan to drill sideways.

562
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:38,485
Speaker 1: They were like nope death.

563
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:41,319
Speaker 1: and then he figured out a plan to drill down and then there's no death.

564
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,583
Speaker 0: Hmm any.

565
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:51,380
Speaker 1: it's implied that anyone who innovates at all is murdered because anyone who fucked around with radio equipment Would have heard those other silos immediately.

566
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:52,722
Speaker 0: That's true.

567
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,789
Speaker 1: I mean the radios themselves.

568
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,654
Speaker 1: if you spend any time analyzing the radio.

569
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:58,300
Speaker 1: Look how quickly he figured it out.

570
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:04,460
Speaker 1: You didn't even need to see the dial with 18 written on it, but to even know a radio is possible, right?

571
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,486
Speaker 1: Well, he knew radio was possible I guess because radio is.

572
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:10,057
Speaker 1: everyone knew the sheriff's had radios and it was part of the pack.

573
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:12,559
Speaker 1: death penalty If you have a radio you're not supposed to have.

574
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:19,700
Speaker 1: But how come Bernard was stupid and he just has this long argument with Juliet over the radio as soon as she talked.

575
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:29,713
Speaker 1: He should just shut the fuck up or held down transmit so no one could hear what she was saying like seriously, dude Or how come the other silos didn't be like what the fuck?

576
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:35,051
Speaker 0: and then to jump down on this How are they supposed to jump down on it from far away in a silo?

577
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,538
Speaker 1: IT any one of them could have just held down.

578
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:40,567
Speaker 1: transmit Sure, that's how that works.

579
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:46,674
Speaker 1: Remember at the Kinetic Con where we lost a radio channel Sure, and remember how hard it was to get around that.

580
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:47,277
Speaker 0: Sure.

581
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:53,573
Speaker 1: Yeah So, I mean it was a super fun book Well written mostly except for that one long overdone scene.

582
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:56,604
Speaker 1: the plot was pretty good Reasonably complex.

583
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:57,447
Speaker 1: I liked it.

584
00:35:57,648 --> 00:36:00,738
Speaker 1: I'm really sad that I'm told the rest of the books are really bad.

585
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,060
Speaker 1: Mmm

586
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 0: I mean, you know I realize you know Like I said at the beginning this story of the people trapped under in a sealed society in the post-apocalypse Right where they can't leave is a story that feels like it's been told often but hasn't actually been told that often.

587
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:22,560
Speaker 0: it's a story I like and After reading this I'm like, you know what this story hasn't really been exposed to the mainstream people.

588
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,435
Speaker 0: So I kind of like it to be like a wool movie.

589
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:28,192
Speaker 0: You'd probably go over Well, and I would like to see the story told again.

590
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,598
Speaker 0: Why the fuck not Fallout 4?

591
00:36:29,598 --> 00:36:32,223
Speaker 0: bring it on Anything else?

592
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:44,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, I I'll say this had I not been told by a bunch of people that the rest of the books are shit I would have immediately started reading the next book.

593
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:49,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like you know, it wasn't like the book was ridiculously deep or anything.

594
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:50,972
Speaker 0: It's just it's just a page turner.

595
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:56,657
Speaker 0: Just like really straightforward Like you just really got to read that next page, which is part of why it didn't take that long to read it.

596
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,924
Speaker 1: Yeah So it's a good book.

597
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:01,771
Speaker 1: I guess Scott is pick another book.

598
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:03,155

Speaker 1: Yeah, you gonna fix something good.

600
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:07,275
Speaker 0: I'll pick something real good.

604
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:23,440
Speaker 1: Yes, it's also really fucking hard to fly to Boston.

605
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, not super respectful for Boston anymore.

606
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:28,140
Speaker 0: Fuck you Boston.

607
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:28,983
Speaker 1: I would not.

608
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:32,719
Speaker 1: I would not move to Boston after what they've done to these conventions because I don't trust the city.

609
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:35,007
Speaker 1: But that's neither here nor there.

610
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:37,400
