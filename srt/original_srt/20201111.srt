1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,078
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, November 11th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:10,280
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:13,525
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,558
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:17,909
Speaker 1: We are reviewing the anime Deca-Dence.

6
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:20,709
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:29,019
Speaker 1: You know, it's been a thousand years since March and like the date doesn't mean anything to me anymore.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,786
Speaker 1: Like it never matters what day it is.

9
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:33,828
Speaker 1: Like I gotta look like Oh, what fucking day is it when I'm gonna say it?

10
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:35,770
Speaker 0: It matters if it's a Saturday or a Sunday.

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,419
Speaker 1: It matters what day of the week it is.

12
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,550
Speaker 1: It does not matter what the number is on the day.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:49,060
Speaker 0: No, because the calendar only matters for special events and if all special events are canceled then why does it matter what the calendar day is, right?

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,365
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be packs.

15
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:51,308
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be a holiday.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,605
Speaker 0: You know, it's like oh, it'll be Thanksgiving, but you won't be doing anything.

17
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,550
Speaker 0: So what does it matter, right?

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,428
Speaker 0: It's just another Thursday.

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,310
Speaker 0: Exactly.

20
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:02,110
Speaker 0: Do I have to work from home or just stay at home?

21
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:11,910
Speaker 1: But I noticed just now that today is 11/11, which there's a holiday not that it matters to us especially in America people barely celebrate Veterans Day or Armistice Day.

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,190
Speaker 0: We have a different Veterans Day.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,030
Speaker 1: But Armistice Day has a weirdly tragic story.

24
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:21,019
Speaker 1: I've learned a lot about World War One because I'm weird.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,922
Speaker 1: I may not like that.

26
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:27,349
Speaker 1: And World War One is a complex tapestry of bullshit that I do not want to get into right now.

27
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:31,830
Speaker 1: There's a lot of complexity to what the hell was going on in World War One.

28
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:39,842
Speaker 1: But the thing that's always struck me is that Armistice Day was on the 11th hour, the 11th day of the 11th month.

29
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,660
Speaker 1: And that wasn't a coincidence.

30
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:51,550
Speaker 1: The powers that be kind of did that on purpose because it was a cool number and people literally died because of that.

31
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:54,757
Speaker 1: And I don't know how many people know that.

32
00:01:55,098 --> 00:02:11,208
Speaker 1: but if you're ever in a position where you are prosecuting a defensive war against an aggressive and belligerent enemy and you have an opportunity for peace and you delay the opportunity for peace or at least a truce in order to make a cool number appear somewhere.

33
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:11,870
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,683
Speaker 1: Like do the right thing.

35
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,448
Speaker 0: The fact that these people had already been the people who had the power to end the war, right?

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,062
Speaker 0: We're also the people who chose to start the war.

37
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:26,130
Speaker 0: So already fuck them.

38
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:33,210
Speaker 1: Well, it's complicated because on one hand a lot of powers were culpable for starting World War One.

39
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,102
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, I will stand by.

40
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,530
Speaker 1: In fact, the last time I was in Australia.

41
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,329
Speaker 1: I ended up getting into an argument with a bunch of strangers about this topic.

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:55,609
Speaker 1: But I would say that Germany was primarily culpable for the continuance of World War One due to their continuing territorial aggression and then their unwillingness to exceed the fact that that did not work.

43
00:02:56,152 --> 00:03:06,110
Speaker 1: But anyway, Armistice Day is a day and that's literally the only interesting thing I can think to talk about in my life since nothing's happened since Monday.

44
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,749
Speaker 0: Nope, not really.

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's get right into some anime news.

46
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,028
Speaker 1: It's actually really, it's news that needed to come.

47
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:15,730
Speaker 1: I'm glad it came.

48
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,177
Speaker 1: I was worried that it wouldn't come.

49
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:25,255
Speaker 1: Like I was actually kind of worried about this but Katsucon has finally, correctly, canceled for 2021.

50
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:25,944
Speaker 0: Oh, finally.

51
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:26,228
Speaker 0: Oof.

52
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:32,790
Speaker 1: I won't share any rumors of any internal things in detail because they're just rumors.

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:42,807
Speaker 1: But basically it is notable that Katsucon waited so long to cancel when other cons that happen around the same time canceled a while ago.

54
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,969
Speaker 1: Like I'm surprised it took this long.

55
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:50,887
Speaker 0: I'm not, I mean, you know based on what I know, I'm not surprised.

56
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:51,349
Speaker 0: I'm just.

57
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,073
Speaker 0: It's hard, I guess it.

58
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:58,850
Speaker 0: can you be disappointed if you expect, it's like if you if it met your low expectations.

59
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:08,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I kind of stopped going to Katsucon when the staff thing happened, but that was so long ago that Katsucon has had much drama that I will not go into.

60
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,309
Speaker 1: But that drama was like a decade ago.

61
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:15,510
Speaker 1: We never even attended the new reformed Katsucon.

62
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,930
Speaker 0: No, no, I barely know what's going on since that drama with Katsucon all those many many years ago.

63
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:30,930
Speaker 0: But it, you know, because of that incident, right, I now in my mind give Katsucon a reputation for being a drama, you know, infused con, right?

64
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:48,129
Speaker 0: And this piece of information, you know, the the whispers that I've heard through who knows what grapevines that, you know, they were doing their best to try to make their event happen instead of, you know, if I ran a convention, I would be doing my best to not make it happen.

65
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:59,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the biggest danger right now are these conventions that are nonprofits where the state that they're in is a shitty state and won't like order them to cancel.

66
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,670
Speaker 1: and thus they're because of stupid laws and stupid contracts.

67
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,165
Speaker 0: MagFest, which is in the same exact building as Katsucon, right?

68
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,330
Speaker 0: It's literally the same place.

69
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:10,009
Speaker 0: Very close to the same time.

70
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,557
Speaker 0: You know, it held back a little bit.

71
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:17,370
Speaker 0: They tried a little bit, but then they're like, okay, no, right?

72
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:24,688
Speaker 0: Most of the people that most of the staff I think that I am aware of were like, yeah, no, if you have it I'm not coming if you have it, right, etc.

73
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,050
Speaker 0: So they didn't like Katsucon, look how long Katsucon held out until literally today.

74
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,836
Speaker 0: So they decided to cancel.

75
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,410
Speaker 1: They did issue follow-up statements.

76
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:44,148
Speaker 1: They said, I'll skip through a lot of this, "Please know that there were many logistical and legal steps to take before we could announce

77
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:44,409
Speaker 1: this.".

78
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:45,595
Speaker 0: That is true.

79
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,446
Speaker 0: That is not incorrect.

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,921
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we've talked about this a bunch of times.

81
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,190
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go deep into it again.

82
00:05:51,290 --> 00:06:04,350
Speaker 1: But for all of you out there who are disappointed that a con's canceled or who are mad that a con is not canceled yet, the thing to bear in mind is that contract law and like the way this works in America is really, really stupid.

83
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,490
Speaker 0: And I'm sure it works stupidly in other countries as well.

84
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,670
Speaker 0: Every country on earth has contracts.

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,071
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

86
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:16,290
Speaker 1: But American contracts, like in particular, part of what's going on is that America did not handle COVID well.

87
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:20,310
Speaker 1: That is the understatement because Republicans were in power.

88
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:30,550
Speaker 1: But as a result, not only is COVID not calming down to a steady state, like it's rising everywhere in the world, but it is rising at a catastrophic rate in America.

89
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,170
Speaker 0: Maybe we saw that coming.

90
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,628
Speaker 0: We were like, you know, in the summer, we were like, "Yeah, it's gonna way be bad when it gets cold

91
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:35,870
Speaker 0: again.".

92
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:36,468
Speaker 0: And we were right.

93
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,032
Speaker 1: Yep.

94
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,350
Speaker 1: A lot of things opened up.

95
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,629
Speaker 0: I didn't want to be right, but we're right.

96
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,191
Speaker 1: Yep.

97
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:45,107
Speaker 1: Now, the tricky part is a lot of people are saying, "Oh, we'll just go

98
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:45,530
Speaker 1: online.".

99
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,203
Speaker 1: Like, "I'm just trying to go

100
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:46,530
Speaker 1: online.".

101
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,370
Speaker 1: But I got to tell you, I've been involved in a lot of online cons up to this point.

102
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,472
Speaker 1: They're doing their best.

103
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:59,050
Speaker 1: However, online cons do not present a compelling story for most of the people who would attend a con.

104
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:00,073
Speaker 0: Right.

105
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:03,370
Speaker 0: Online cons do, you know, are a thing, right?

106
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,110
Speaker 0: But basically, they're just, you know, even if you do all the best stuff that you can do at the online con.

107
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,649
Speaker 1: You can have a bunch of panels and some discords to hang out in.

108
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,070
Speaker 0: Right.

109
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:19,970
Speaker 0: You are not making something that replaces the in-person con or serves the same purpose.

110
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,999
Speaker 0: You are just, you know, doing what.

111
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,190
Speaker 0: you have a company and you're doing what you can with your resources, plus the internet, to make money and engage your audience.

112
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:30,771
Speaker 0: Right.

113
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,309
Speaker 0: But you are not replacing the thing you actually do.

114
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,690
Speaker 1: And that's why, like, I think I hope God's Gun does try to do something online.

115
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:46,930
Speaker 1: I like that cons are doing this because they're basically doing it, one, to keep their brand afloat, two, to give their staff something to do, and three, just to, like, do something for the community they work with.

116
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,490
Speaker 1: Like, hey, if you run a con, usually you're running it because you want a cool thing to happen.

117
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,150
Speaker 1: Why not do the coolest thing you can do under the circumstances?

118
00:07:54,812 --> 00:08:02,030
Speaker 1: But it is basically impossible to charge any amount of money for an online con, except in rare circumstances.

119
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,598
Speaker 0: It depends.

120
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:04,207
Speaker 1: Yeah.

121
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:04,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

122
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:08,810
Speaker 1: And online cons do cost money to run for a lot of reasons.

123
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,489
Speaker 1: So we'll see what happens.

124
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:15,589
Speaker 1: But I just don't think there's going to be any cons in 2021 the way America is going right now.

125
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,042
Speaker 0: Who knows?

126
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,230
Speaker 1: So at least the other thing that I can say is I was scrolling through all these tweets.

127
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,490
Speaker 1: Very few people are mad about this.

128
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:33,210
Speaker 1: Everyone seems to be taking this the right way, which is actually very heartening compared to how some people reacted to other cons being canceled last year.

129
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,587
Speaker 1: Well, last year, earlier this year.

130
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:37,832
Speaker 1: God damn it.

131
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:42,010
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so tiny news here, right?

132
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:49,790
Speaker 0: So we did a Geek Nights episode on season one of Beastars, which is an AA anime, Beastars is great.

133
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,087
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

134
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:57,469
Speaker 0: And season two, we knew was coming eventually, but now we know it's coming January 5th, so January 5th.

135
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,717
Speaker 0: And you know how Netflix do.

136
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,630
Speaker 0: every episode is going to be there all at once.

137
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,030
Speaker 0: Right.

138
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,910
Speaker 0: So on January 5th, you'll be able to watch all of Beastars season two.

139
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,573
Speaker 1: I'm excited.

140
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,790
Speaker 1: I like this giant snake guy we're looking at here.

141
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:09,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, we haven't.

142
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,950
Speaker 0: I was wondering about, you know, those kinds of animals.

143
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:16,089
Speaker 1: But especially because this snake is gigantic.

144
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,041
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

145
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:18,529
Speaker 0: All right.

146
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,450
Speaker 0: Other tiny news, right?

147
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,650
Speaker 0: So there's an anime called Venus Wars that was a big deal in the U.S.

148
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:25,719
Speaker 0: in the 90s, late 90s.

149
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,390
Speaker 0: It was, you know, it was a sci-fi channel.

150
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,390
Speaker 0: Was it actually on sci-fi?

151
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,244
Speaker 1: It was on sci-fi network.

152
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:37,970
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure because I remember it was one of those few anime that were dubbed in the U.S.

153
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:38,533
Speaker 0: early.

154
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:41,870
Speaker 1: I rented it from Blockbuster and copied that VHS tape.

155
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

156
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,609
Speaker 0: How notable and good is it really?

157
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:45,612
Speaker 0: Right.

158
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:51,270
Speaker 0: If it wasn't for the fact that it was one of those few anime that was distributed in the U.S.

159
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,590
Speaker 0: in those days, would it even be known today?

160
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,031
Speaker 1: You know what?

161
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:54,693
Speaker 1: It's interesting.

162
00:09:54,954 --> 00:10:00,615
Speaker 1: I really liked it as a kid and it was good, but it basically doesn't have an ending.

163
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,685
Speaker 1: like it's a kind of one of those real war stories.

164
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:14,350
Speaker 1: like take a little bit of Akira aesthetics, not the crazy stuff, but just like the bike stuff, coupled with some little bit of mech stuff, but more like big tanks and make it a Red Dawn situation.

165
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,722
Speaker 1: A bunch of punk kids trying to fight against this occupation.

166
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:21,390
Speaker 1: like it's kind of a real war story, but the end just doesn't fucking go anywhere.

167
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,470
Speaker 1: Like this movie just ends on nothing.

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,069
Speaker 0: So anyway, did we ever review it?

169
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,770
Speaker 0: No, we thought we talked about reviewing it several times, but we only had a video CD that we got for free at a con somewhere.

170
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,305
Speaker 1: The only mention on our site about Venus Wars is in the out of date.

171
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,989
Speaker 1: I forgot this existed about rim page.

172
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,830
Speaker 0: Anyway, so why is Venus Wars make your about rim page?

173
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,229
Speaker 1: When he was nine, he saw his first anime, Vampire Hunter D, Robot Carnival, Project Echo, Venus Wars.

174
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:02,930
Speaker 0: OK, anyway, so by this show, Sentai Filmworks has license rescued it from wherever it was.

175
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:07,708
Speaker 0: So it's going to be available to watch again easily soon.

176
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,760
Speaker 0: Now, I don't know exactly what actually like.

177
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,589
Speaker 0: I'm glad I got the article and read it.

178
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:29,473
Speaker 0: So, you know, regardless of whether this thing's any frickin good or worth watching in the year 2020, it does have a significance to the history of anime in the United States only and may be worth the time it takes to watch a single movie just to know what the deal was.

179
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,290
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's going to be easy to do that soon or maybe even now.

180
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,610
Speaker 0: Click on the article, get the date.

181
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,052
Speaker 0: I don't know.

182
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got a few like really good iconic scenes.

183
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,630
Speaker 1: Like there's a scene with the reporter and her camera that's really tense.

184
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,469
Speaker 1: But yeah, just don't expect this movie to end.

185
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:45,112
Speaker 0: Right.

186
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:52,470
Speaker 0: In some other news, we got a good news, bad news here from maybe the best anime distributor/publisher.

187
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,488
Speaker 0: I don't know what they count as.

188
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,730
Speaker 1: And why are these two news on the same page?

189
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:58,869
Speaker 0: Because they're both discotheque.

190
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,190
Speaker 0: Discotheque made two announcements.

191
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,930
Speaker 0: It was a single press release in discotheque announcing two things they're doing.

192
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,549
Speaker 0: So the first thing discotheque is doing, we'll do bad news first, right?

193
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:13,169
Speaker 0: Is there is an OAV, an OVA, kind of not super old, but kind of old one.

194
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:19,027
Speaker 0: And they're releasing, they're re-releasing it and it is called Kiss X Sis.

195
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:26,170
Speaker 0: And you're probably thinking, listen to the name of that anime and thinking about what is an anime called Kiss X Sis about?

196
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,829
Speaker 1: Well, it's either Hunter X Hunter, like Hunter X Hunter kind of situation or it's incest porn.

197
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,590
Speaker 0: It is absolutely incest porn.

198
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,350
Speaker 0: This anime is so bad.

199
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:46,410
Speaker 0: This is like, you know, we make fun of a lot of animes, especially when we're judging animes about like, we're like, we get a whiff and we're like, stay away from this.

200
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:54,129
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I feel like I say Kiss X Sis sometimes as like, oh, this is going to be a Kiss X Sis situation.

201
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,854
Speaker 0: This is worse.

202
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,910
Speaker 0: I think Kiss X Sis is worse than like Chubra.

203
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,149
Speaker 0: This is like, oh, for sure.

204
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,850
Speaker 1: Chubra is positively tame compared to this bullshit.

205
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:12,050
Speaker 0: In fact, there are things that are just like, you know, actual hentai, right, that are less distasteful than Kiss X Sis, right?

206
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,610
Speaker 0: Because you have an actual hentai where like people are having consensual sex.

207
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,697
Speaker 0: You know, it might be drawn in a way to subjectifying people and has other problems with it.

208
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:22,020
Speaker 0: Right.

209
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:22,810
Speaker 0: It's not perfect.

210
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:32,586
Speaker 0: But Kiss X Sis is this dude has two sisters, literal sisters who want him to pay step sisters.

211
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:34,613
Speaker 0: Right.

212
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,970
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure these people are too young, I'm guessing.

213
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,576
Speaker 1: I mean, it's anime.

214
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,270
Speaker 0: So I have not looked into that many details.

215
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,179
Speaker 0: I just know enough.

216
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,189
Speaker 0: And that's all I know.

217
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:45,619
Speaker 0: And that's enough to know.

218
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,210
Speaker 0: this is the worst thing ever.

219
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,430
Speaker 0: Why are they bringing this back?

220
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:57,089
Speaker 1: But I guess they like the ad copy, like the copy from the press release, like specifically calls it out as a taboo breaking love bloom.

221
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,418
Speaker 1: Like, yeah.

222
00:13:59,144 --> 00:13:59,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what it is.

223
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,540
Speaker 1: They know what it is.

224
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,250
Speaker 1: They're marketing it.

225
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:08,435
Speaker 0: And that so having to be aware of the existence of Kiss X Sis is the price we have to pay for a discotheque.

226
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:17,710
Speaker 0: to also announce they are re-releasing one of the best Lupin movies, the Miyazaki one, the one that's not like any other Lupin movie.

227
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:18,900
Speaker 0: That's right.

228
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,750
Speaker 0: But it's still amazing.

229
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:28,585
Speaker 0: The most famous one, Castle of Cagliostro is getting released again this time in on a UHD Bure, which is 4K Bure.

230
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:31,849
Speaker 0: So you can wait for someone to rip that.

231
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:40,450
Speaker 0: And basically they had, you know, unlike a lot of other things, they try to re-release where they can't get like, you know, Project Aco, we can't find the material.

232
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,609
Speaker 1: We're literally using this laser disc.

233
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,217
Speaker 0: Exactly right.

234
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,830
Speaker 0: It's not one of those situations.

235
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,730
Speaker 0: This is like they have this.

236
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,730
Speaker 0: They have all kinds of material from this.

237
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:57,590
Speaker 0: In fact, it's going to include original like Japanese seven point one audio that they have for ultra surround sound and shit.

238
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:13,713
Speaker 0: So this is probably going to be all indications, the ultimate home release, like you cannot beat this short of going to a theater and maybe even going to a theater with film wouldn't be as good maybe as what they are about to release, like the ultimate edition of this anime.

239
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:16,521
Speaker 0: So I wouldn't.

240
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:24,070
Speaker 0: I personally don't buy physical media, but, you know, if you do or if you can get a pirated rip of this or whatever, it's coming.

241
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,170
Speaker 0: And that's that's exciting.

242
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we would give it a rewatch.

243
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:36,610
Speaker 1: We're living in an era where a lot of anime is getting remastered and rereleased basically at the best possible quality that is possible, possible, possible, possible.

244
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,688
Speaker 1: I said that a bunch of times.

245
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:38,832
Speaker 0: All right.

246
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,129
Speaker 0: So that's that's an excellent news.

247
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,430
Speaker 0: And I just want to mention this one other thing.

248
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,870
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've ever judged this show.

249
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:46,918
Speaker 0: I've never seen it.

250
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,409
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's a manga about it.

251
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,154
Speaker 0: I think there might be.

252
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:51,650
Speaker 1: I don't think we judged it because I would remember this title.

253
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:52,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

254
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:59,370
Speaker 0: So I basically well, I think we might have seen the title in Japanese, but basically there's an anime, maybe manga.

255
00:15:59,550 --> 00:15:59,813
Speaker 0: I don't know.

256
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:01,670
Speaker 0: I have to go to Wikipedia and Google it.

257
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:02,950
Speaker 0: I didn't do that before the show.

258
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,454
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

259
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,070
Speaker 0: But there's an anime that's coming.

260
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:10,650
Speaker 0: And all I know about it is the synopsis of the plot and the synopsis of the plot.

261
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,650
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like it's going to be a great all time anime.

262
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,030
Speaker 0: I'm not going to lie and be like, oh, this is going to be amazing.

263
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:21,148
Speaker 0: But the concept of the show seems so fun that I just I'm going to like.

264
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,593
Speaker 0: it makes me want to go check it out.

265
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:29,450
Speaker 0: So here's the show is called in English, Suppose a Kid from the Last Dungeon Boonies Moved to a Starter Town.

266
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:38,256
Speaker 0: So this is obviously, you know, one of those shows where the world is a fantasy world that works like.

267
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,589
Speaker 1: it's basically basically Takumi from Initial D.

268
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:41,873
Speaker 0: Right.

269
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:45,090
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a world where it's a fantasy world.

270
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:55,715
Speaker 0: It's not a video game thing, but it's where the world works the way an RPG works the same way as like Delicious and Dungeon, where the world works the way an RPG works, even though it's not.

271
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:58,430
Speaker 0: it's not about real people in the real world going into a game.

272
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,770
Speaker 0: It's just a world that works the way a game works.

273
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:06,890
Speaker 0: And in this world, there's this tiny little kid, right, who's mad weak.

274
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,790
Speaker 0: He's he's so weak compared to like all his friends and family.

275
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,029
Speaker 0: He's just so sad and weak.

276
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:12,771
Speaker 0: Right.

277
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:19,410
Speaker 0: So he leaves his home and he goes to like the starter tutorial town of the world.

278
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:19,977
Speaker 0: Right.

279
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,748
Speaker 0: Wherever that is.

280
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,730
Speaker 1: Let's go to Canaria and I'm going to figure go fight Garland.

281
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:28,029
Speaker 1: That's a basic moves venture for parties level one to three.

282
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:28,993
Speaker 0: Right.

283
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:32,870
Speaker 0: He moves to to Canaria, right, to parties one to three go.

284
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:47,050
Speaker 0: And it just turns out that where he comes from is a village that is sitting right next to directly adjacent to the most dangerous final boss dungeon in the entire world.

285
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,290
Speaker 1: Like basically the tomb of horrors is right there.

286
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:49,691
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:50,374
Speaker 0: Right.

288
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,550
Speaker 0: So he was the weakest kid in his town, so weak that he left.

289
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,429
Speaker 0: And moved away because, you know, everyone else is so much stronger than him.

290
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:00,750
Speaker 0: And he goes to the tutorial town, but in which he is basically God tier.

291
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,826
Speaker 0: But he looks like a little kid.

292
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:02,049
Speaker 0: Right.

293
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,570
Speaker 0: So just that concept is such an anime manga concept.

294
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:07,272
Speaker 0: Right.

295
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:07,875
Speaker 0: You can't.

296
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,955
Speaker 0: it's like if you just told me that plot, I would say that plot is definitely an anime plot.

297
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,849
Speaker 0: There's no way that that's something else.

298
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,115
Speaker 1: I love the whole thing.

299
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:20,670
Speaker 1: The title of the anime is, quote, Suppose a kid from the last dungeon booties booties moved to a starter town.

300
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,652
Speaker 0: Yes.

301
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:30,250
Speaker 0: And it's like, wow, that seems like, you know, not going to be the greatest show, but it seems like it could be a lot of fun if they don't spend too long on battles.

302
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,149
Speaker 0: That could be a really fun show.

303
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,489
Speaker 1: It has a little bit of a concept.

304
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,348
Speaker 1: It could be like Goku, though.

305
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,889
Speaker 1: If anyone remembers, it could be.

306
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,678
Speaker 1: I like Goku.

307
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:38,670
Speaker 0: So I'm right.

308
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,410
Speaker 0: So I'm kind of interested based on just the concept alone.

309
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:41,892
Speaker 0: I want to.

310
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:45,234
Speaker 0: I think I'm like, you know, I want to give this show a chance to see what the deal is.

311
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:45,802
Speaker 0: It might be funny.

312
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:46,269
Speaker 0: Yeah.

313
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,709
Speaker 0: So in another I tell people it exists.

314
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:49,834
Speaker 1: Another small news.

315
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:57,250
Speaker 1: If you didn't see, as we know, HBO is bringing out one by one hour long Adventure Time continuing specials set throughout different.

316
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,219
Speaker 0: Did we do an episode?

317
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,350
Speaker 0: We did an episode of the BMO one.

318
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

319
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,290
Speaker 1: So the next one is coming.

320
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,530
Speaker 1: The Marceline and Bubblegum won Obsidian.

321
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,890
Speaker 1: We they just dropped.

322
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,990
Speaker 0: I thought that would be the final one, but I guess not.

323
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

324
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,309
Speaker 1: The final one is supposedly just Finn and Jake again.

325
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that, you know, I thought it wouldn't be shocked if they make more after these four.

326
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:15,749
Speaker 1: They seem to be doing well.

327
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,590
Speaker 0: We'll see how many people, you know, they'll do whatever they want to do.

328
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:18,812
Speaker 0: Yeah.

329
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,290
Speaker 1: But Distant Lands, Obsidian.

330
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,768
Speaker 1: We have the trailer for it.

331
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:30,010
Speaker 1: And remember in the beginning when Marceline first gets introduced and she's like, oh, I was on vacation and it shows like hula hooping in some lava.

332
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:39,730
Speaker 1: Pretty sure the place with the lava is the place that they go to in this one because there's the lava and the dragon and like the crystal glass people.

333
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,541
Speaker 0: But the fact that they're together means it's not.

334
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,813
Speaker 0: it's not a story about Marceline's vacation.

335
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:47,990
Speaker 0: It definitely takes place after the end of Adventure Time based on the trailer.

336
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:48,633
Speaker 1: Yeah.

337
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:58,756
Speaker 1: Based on the trailer, the end of the TV 90 percent, it takes place after the end of the show or it takes place possibly during that brief era where Marceline and Bubblegum were like dating.

338
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:00,689
Speaker 1: But like the Candy Kingdom wasn't fully formed.

339
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,695
Speaker 1: It's not clear.

340
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:02,868
Speaker 0: I don't.

341
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

342
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:05,729
Speaker 1: Pretty sure it just takes place at the end.

343
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,574
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm pretty sure it takes place after the end of the TV show, unlike the BMO one, which takes place.

344
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,929
Speaker 1: Well, spoiler to say when that one takes place.

345
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

346
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:15,597
Speaker 0: Whatever.

347
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,550
Speaker 1: But the BMO one was great.

348
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,389
Speaker 1: So I'm actually really excited about this one.

349
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:27,210
Speaker 0: The trailer for this one actually makes it look like it's going to be, I don't know, I want to say better, but like it goes harder.

350
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,172
Speaker 1: I think so.

351
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:32,755
Speaker 1: Like it starts with like Marceline and Bubblegum are definitely in a committed direct relationship.

352
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:35,688
Speaker 1: Like they're not dancing around that like they had to in this one.

353
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,896
Speaker 0: This one's good.

354
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,189
Speaker 0: This one's going hard.

355
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,730
Speaker 0: So if you're an Adventure Time fan, it's good news.

356
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,178
Speaker 1: I mean, they're going to fight a dragon.

357
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,050
Speaker 1: There's a very like direct narrative here.

358
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,730
Speaker 1: The BMO one was very like interesting and told a story around the edges.

359
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,599
Speaker 1: This one, I think, is just going to be a direct.

360
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,810
Speaker 1: Marceline goes and fucks up this dragon via confronting trauma in some fashion.

361
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:56,247
Speaker 0: Yep.

362
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:56,308
Speaker 0: OK.

363
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,920
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

364
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,187
Speaker 1: What do you got?

365
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:16,100
Speaker 0: So I'm going to continue my tradition of using non things that don't match the geek night's day for a thing of the day.

366
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,063
Speaker 0: Right.

367
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,200
Speaker 0: So I found out about this like a while ago.

368
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:22,920
Speaker 0: Actually, and it was just so interesting.

369
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:34,779
Speaker 0: Apparently, people say that there are some authors and writers out there, prominent ones, most notably the Game of Thrones guy, although I don't know if you can call himself a writer because what has he written recently?

370
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:37,851
Speaker 0: The R.R.

371
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:38,540
Speaker 0: Martin, whatever.

372
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

373
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,183
Speaker 0: Old beard guy.

374
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:41,406
Speaker 0: who do?

375
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:47,247
Speaker 0: who still to this day do their writing, not with, you know, pen and paper.

376
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,419
Speaker 0: They're not going that old school.

377
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:49,082
Speaker 0: Right.

378
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:54,746
Speaker 0: Not with Microsoft Word, like some new one, but specifically word perfect for DOS.

379
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaker 0: Right.

380
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:09,560
Speaker 0: Where are or some sort of older word processor from that exact that brief period of time when word processors were still complex, you know, complex and fully featured there, you know, beyond text editors.

381
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:10,422
Speaker 0: Right.

382
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:17,608
Speaker 0: But not ridiculously full of features, which I guess around happened, maybe like maybe Microsoft Word.

383
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:24,280
Speaker 0: ninety five, maybe was around the time where they really went like, you know, ridiculous with the word processor and cluttered it up with.

384
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Speaker 1: I remember working like writing documents in these early eras of word processing.

385
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember writing an essay on an actual noncomputer, like a word processor where the screen was like four rows of base.

386
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,846
Speaker 0: I tried to go look for like.

387
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:42,359
Speaker 0: I tried to go look to see if anyone still made one of those or be if you could get old ones.

388
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,300
Speaker 1: Someone I saw some people are making some modern ones, but they're running like Raspberry inside of or something.

389
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not actually, you know, anyway, the point is, is that, you know, do you?

390
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,620
Speaker 0: actually it's a lot of hassle, right, to go do that.

391
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,020
Speaker 0: We need an old DOS computer.

392
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:58,901
Speaker 0: It's like.

393
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:03,155
Speaker 0: so here is a project actually that, you know, it's called.

394
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,720
Speaker 0: what's it called?

395
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,480
Speaker 0: Word perfect for DOS updated, updated.

396
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:07,881
Speaker 0: Right.

397
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,236
Speaker 0: And it's a whole set of instructions whereby you can.

398
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:29,280
Speaker 0: Get word perfect for DOS 5 1 6 6 1 or 6 2 to run on a modern computer, and they even have tools where you can like convert between Doc X format to word perfect format to get your files saved and loaded back and forth.

399
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:33,900
Speaker 0: You can print you can you can get the clipboard will work.

400
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,399
Speaker 0: You can copy and paste into it.

401
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:35,762
Speaker 0: Right.

402
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:36,024
Speaker 0: You can.

403
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,500
Speaker 0: they have all this stuff working.

404
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,443
Speaker 0: It's pretty impressive.

405
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,300
Speaker 0: I didn't feel like going through the hassle of doing it.

406
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:50,604
Speaker 0: But it really appeals to me in a strong way, not because I want to use specifically old as word perfect for DOS,

407
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:51,306
Speaker 1: but

408
00:23:51,687 --> 00:24:09,459
Speaker 0: the though that exact time period, the word processors that came out then right were had like this exact feature set of, you know, having enough features that word type, you know, typing is, you know, lovely and pleasant and you're not like missing anything.

409
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,380
Speaker 0: But there isn't a whole bunch of stuff like getting in the way.

410
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,581
Speaker 0: Right.

411
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:13,802
Speaker 0: It's like.

412
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:20,940
Speaker 1: I know personally, you know, I would argue those things don't get in the way of anyone with basic discipline, but maybe.

413
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:21,985
Speaker 0: But it's like.

414
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,320
Speaker 0: I just know that psychologically speaking, right.

415
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,619
Speaker 0: If I go to type something like, you know, I'm writing like, you know, essay long, a long form text of some kind.

416
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:34,060
Speaker 0: If I do it in a text editor, that's no, you know, like Vim.

417
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,395
Speaker 0: It's like that doesn't cut it.

418
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:35,660
Speaker 0: Right.

419
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,060
Speaker 0: Vim doesn't, you know, format text and do it directly in LaTeX.

420
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:40,346
Speaker 0: Yeah.

421
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,660
Speaker 0: You can't do headers or anything.

422
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

423
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:50,880
Speaker 0: You know, I could do it in LaTeX if it would, you know, but LaTeX only looks that way after you're done typing it, not while you're typing it.

424
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,161
Speaker 0: Right.

425
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:58,640
Speaker 0: So, you know, you have to type some, you know, if you're using like Lex or something, you got to type in the weird language or whatever.

426
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,920
Speaker 0: It's not that's not pleasant either.

427
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:00,622
Speaker 0: Right.

428
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:03,540
Speaker 0: But if you're going to use like the newest, newest Microsoft Word.

429
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:04,482
Speaker 0: Right.

430
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:12,840
Speaker 0: Or even Google Docs, you got to try to type a long thing in Google Docs and it's actually not, you know, it sort of gets in the way a little bit.

431
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:13,282
Speaker 0: Right.

432
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:19,190
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you type in and you get this formatting and it's popping up with like spell checks and all, you know, it's like.

433
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:21,603
Speaker 1: what fucking word do you have set up?

434
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:22,577
Speaker 1: I don't have any of these problems.

435
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:36,820
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, I'm just saying psychologically speaking, right, is, you know, there's less, you know, my mind is less focused on just the content of what I'm writing because it's being distracted in some way.

436
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:49,640
Speaker 1: I know, I'm just giving you shit, partly because the person who made this website is definitely like you and like has particular, did you click on the link they have for, quote, the fact why some people use a DOS error word processor?

437
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:50,770
Speaker 0: No, I did not.

438
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:51,600
Speaker 0: I did not read that.

439
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,144
Speaker 0: What does it say?

440
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:54,460
Speaker 1: Oh, if you click on that, it says everything is explained here.

441
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:58,800
Speaker 1: If you click on that, it takes you to the XKCD about how DOS is fine.

442
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:00,762
Speaker 1: And that's it.

443
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:19,820
Speaker 1: It's a very, but I guess what you're missing is that there are modern applications that are designed for things like I am writing a novel or an essay that are limited to the functions you would need that are useful for that specific purpose, like chapter outlines or plot outlines or citations.

444
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:24,000
Speaker 1: There are, but otherwise minimal and focused on the content.

445
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:24,981
Speaker 0: Sure.

446
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:31,005
Speaker 0: The other thing is that just the aesthetic of, oh, I would argue with you on the aesthetic.

447
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:32,300
Speaker 1: It's partly nostalgia.

448
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,200
Speaker 1: Like we grew up through all these areas.

449
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,859
Speaker 1: Like Scott, I literally grew up through like I wrote essays on a typewriter, mechanical, a mechanical one.

450
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,980
Speaker 1: We play you could plug it in because it would automatically do character turns.

451
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:46,060
Speaker 1: But otherwise, they're just a mechanical typewriter.

452
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:49,219
Speaker 1: And every era of word processors we've used.

453
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:50,382
Speaker 0: Yep.

454
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:55,583
Speaker 0: So like I wouldn't personally use this project, mostly because it's too much of a hassle to.

455
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:59,462
Speaker 1: Also, did you read the fact at the bottom false positives from antivirus software?

456
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:05,800
Speaker 1: Do not email me if you get if this says if if your antivirus tells you this is malware, use other software.

457
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:06,800
Speaker 0: Yep.

458
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:15,507
Speaker 0: But I would really love for somebody to to like write a piece of software that was basically a clone of word.

459
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,700
Speaker 0: perfect for DOS, except for Windows 10.

460
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,605
Speaker 1: You know, it'd be fun.

461
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:22,080
Speaker 1: Make it as a game instead of word processor.

462
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,119
Speaker 0: What do you mean as a game?

463
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,160
Speaker 1: You make the word to make you start an old word perfect and the game happens in there as you try to make a document.

464
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:36,660
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's like you pull a frog fraction.

465
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, you pull a frog fractions, but it stays with that aesthetic to the end.

466
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:41,861
Speaker 0: Yeah.

467
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,679
Speaker 0: So that, you know, if this interests you in any way.

468
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,322
Speaker 0: Right.

469
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:53,640
Speaker 0: If you if you just imagine like, you know, if you're doing some writing and you think, man, it would be really nice to write it with, you know, a word processor a lot like an old word perfect.

470
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,526
Speaker 0: Well, here's how you can.

471
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,540
Speaker 0: here's how you can do it on your modern computer.

472
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,325
Speaker 0: That's neat.

473
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,219
Speaker 1: So I just did an anime thing.

474
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:08,279
Speaker 1: I don't know how many of you have actually ever watched the old Speed Racer, like the like Speed Racer, but a couple episodes a long time ago.

475
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,280
Speaker 1: Speed is kind of a gigantic dick like he is mean.

476
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:15,679
Speaker 1: He is cruel.

477
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,479
Speaker 1: The show is if you've never seen it, it's probably not what you think it is.

478
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:24,421
Speaker 1: But one thing that really stands out in this video sort of encapsulates it is that speed kills.

479
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:32,636
Speaker 1: a lot of people like with guns, like speed will just bust out a gun and murder a whole bunch of people that happen.

480
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,945
Speaker 0: They're bad guys.

481
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are bad guys.

482
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,079
Speaker 1: He's killing, quote, bad guys.

483
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:40,220
Speaker 1: There's other videos that highlight other horrible things.

484
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,902
Speaker 1: Speed is done.

485
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:46,539
Speaker 1: But I think this video really encapsulates like the mood of what Speed Racer is really like to watch it.

486
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:54,016
Speaker 1: But it's a compilation just of him using guns, except one point where he murders someone with his car instead of with the gun.

487
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,680
Speaker 0: And it's I mean, you know, Wacky Races is pretty similar, right?

488
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,218
Speaker 0: In Wacky Races, you've got, you know, the bad guys, right?

489
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,119
Speaker 0: And they're intentionally running people off the road.

490
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:09,859
Speaker 0: But then it's like Yogi Bear, but he runs people off the road, too.

491
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:16,339
Speaker 1: I would like I would watch a like modern reboot Rocky Wacky Races type thing.

492
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,268
Speaker 1: Bonus points if you want to watch that.

493
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:29,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, Metamoment, the biggest news we got because we don't have cons, there's no new panels to upload or anything, but we are or we did.

494
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:33,240
Speaker 1: We published and officially activated the new Geek Nights Community Code of Conduct.

495
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:39,959
Speaker 1: I recommend you read it because if you're listening to this and you're interacting with us in any way, this code of conduct applies to you.

496
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:43,260
Speaker 1: It will not be a problem for you unless you're a bad person.

497
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:52,440
Speaker 0: If there is a digital or physical space in which we are organizing the community and so social activity, then this rule applies.

498
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:58,823
Speaker 0: And if you do not abide by the rule, you will be evicted from the space to the best of our ability.

499
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,999
Speaker 0: So you should read it.

500
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:01,882
Speaker 1: Yep.

501
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:07,600
Speaker 1: If you think you are not a bad person, but you think that we should make some changes to this, it's in GitHub.

502
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,760
Speaker 1: I know this is the Wednesday Geek Nights, but trust me, GitHub is not that hard to use.

503
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:17,119
Speaker 1: But you can submit changes to our code of conduct and we will review them.

504
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:24,179
Speaker 0: And you could just also just contact us using any means of communication whatsoever to tell us what you think about it.

505
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,140
Speaker 0: Positive, negative, change this, change that, you know, comment, whatever.

506
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:29,760
Speaker 0: It's always subject to change.

507
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,610
Speaker 0: It's not perfect.

508
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:31,219
Speaker 0: So, yep.

509
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:33,279
Speaker 1: And we'll continue to evolve it as time goes on.

510
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,080
Speaker 1: But speaking of community, remember, we have a forum.

511
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:44,600
Speaker 1: We have a legacy forum, like 12 years of like old posts from the old forum, which was really, really high volume compared to the new forum.

512
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,240
Speaker 1: Partly because forums aren't as common anymore.

513
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:47,658
Speaker 1: Like they're not as used as they used to be.

514
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:48,908
Speaker 1: We got a Discord.

515
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,420
Speaker 1: We got this YouTube stream right here.

516
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,519
Speaker 1: There's a million, million places.

517
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,179
Speaker 1: Actually, there's like seven places you can interact with us.

518
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,699
Speaker 1: But we're in all those places.

519
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,783
Speaker 1: Just find us.

520
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:59,980
Speaker 1: Type Geek Nights into whatever text box is in front of you.

521
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,480
Speaker 1: And unless it's WordPerfect on MS-DOS, it'll probably take you to one of those places.

522
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're on the Twitter, Facebook, freaking Spotify.

523
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,440
Speaker 1: Don't contact us on Facebook, please.

524
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,420
Speaker 0: No, but there is a page there.

525
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:13,899
Speaker 1: It is technically still there.

526
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:19,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I posted on it once and was like, hey, does anyone see this?

527
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,233
Speaker 0: And people saw it.

528
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess so.

529
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:31,558
Speaker 1: And otherwise, the the Geek Nights Book Club books, even the tale of Genji, I think I might just start reading it again every time I poop.

530
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:39,704
Speaker 1: Oh, so watch out if I if I continue this trend for the rest of the week, then you're on notice.

531
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:40,860
Speaker 0: I'll tell you.

532
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,506
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what.

533
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:42,779
Speaker 0: As soon as you read.

534
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:56,660
Speaker 0: The first person, right, if you read a page of the tale of Genji that you have not read before or I read a page of it that I have not read before, immediately message the other person and say, I'm reading it right this second.

535
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,592
Speaker 0: And that way, you know, whoever writes it, as soon as you receive the message, well, now you don't need to send because that's where we will know what I read.

536
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:10,699
Speaker 1: What I read was I skimmed through what I had read already to remind myself where I was.

537
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:11,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

538
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:17,960
Speaker 0: So, you know, we will that we will know exactly who started reading again first.

539
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:21,680
Speaker 0: And the other person will then have the hot, you know, the fire on the ass.

540
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:22,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

541
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:26,520
Speaker 1: But you're on notice, the fire's not like, yeah, I've only done this twice.

542
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,800
Speaker 1: That's two poops worth of reading.

543
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:37,860
Speaker 0: The point is, if one of us finishes it and the other person is not yet finished or not even started continuing reading it, oh, then every time we get to them at a moment.

544
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:38,362
Speaker 0: Right.

545
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:46,800
Speaker 0: For example, if I finish it and you haven't and you haven't even started, I'm going to be like, I've finished the tale of Genji, but still hasn't read any since.

546
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:48,518
Speaker 0: And that's going to be bad.

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,099
Speaker 1: So shame is a powerful motivator.

548
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:51,984
Speaker 0: That's right.

549
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,620
Speaker 0: So as soon as one of us starts, the other person has to also.

550
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:59,260
Speaker 1: So, yeah, otherwise, let's go right into it.

551
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,656
Speaker 1: Decadence will avoid for the beginning, at least spoiling anything about the show, but will spoil a little bit.

552
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:07,300
Speaker 0: So that's very difficult.

553
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,087
Speaker 0: But here, so we judge.

554
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:12,480
Speaker 0: we judge this show for the Crunchyroll Expo.

555
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if that made the cut.

556
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,140
Speaker 1: I think I might have edited out for time, like our review of the show at the time.

557
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,266
Speaker 0: We said this looks like a proper noun laden, sort of, you know, tropey, very anime kind of anime.

558
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,660
Speaker 0: That's I think that's what we said.

559
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:28,900
Speaker 0: I don't remember clearly.

560
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,140
Speaker 1: But I remember the result was, regardless of those details, that this show is probably fine, but probably not great.

561
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:40,240
Speaker 1: This is a show that I will not watch unless there is buzz about it.

562
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,658
Speaker 1: If other people are talking about it, then I will watch it to see what the drill is.

563
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:46,451
Speaker 1: Yep.

564
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:46,875
Speaker 1: And that buzz.

565
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,597
Speaker 1: Behold, there was buzz, buzz, like bit by bit, like one of our like.

566
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:56,939
Speaker 1: someone on Twitter was like tweeted something that I follow, I follow them and they were like something something decadence.

567
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,867
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

568
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,119
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, all right.

569
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:00,698
Speaker 1: Wasn't that the show we judge?

570
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:09,541
Speaker 1: And then our friends use the Natalie over the other guy we're hanging out a few weeks ago and they were like, oh, if you watch Decadence yet, oh, I'm not even I won't say anything.

571
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:14,739
Speaker 1: They refused to say anything about the show until I had seen two episodes.

572
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,080
Speaker 0: OK, so Decadence is an anime and it's only 12 episodes long.

573
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,119
Speaker 0: That's the whole damn show.

574
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to finish it.

575
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:34,040
Speaker 0: So you can think of it as a four hour movie, which is actually not significantly longer than like, I don't know, Lawrence of Arabia.

576
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,300
Speaker 0: It's like it's basically the same.

577
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:43,620
Speaker 0: So you can just think of it as, you know, one thing that you're going to watch all at once or break it up into two parts, whatever.

578
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,257
Speaker 0: It's really not long at all.

579
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've only watched four episodes.

580
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,918
Speaker 1: Scott's watched the whole thing.

581
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:58,100
Speaker 1: But what I'll say is that I see why people were acting the way they were about this show, why everyone who mentioned it to me always said the same thing.

582
00:34:58,302 --> 00:34:59,779
Speaker 1: Oh, watch a bunch of it.

583
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:01,720
Speaker 1: Then let's talk about it.

584
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,759
Speaker 1: The show is not about what you think it's about.

585
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it is a 12 episode show.

586
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,840
Speaker 0: It does not appear to have been based on a manga of any kind.

587
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:14,079
Speaker 0: It was directed by someone, Yuzuru Tachikawa, who I've never heard of.

588
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
Speaker 0: They might have done something else.

589
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,462
Speaker 0: I don't know.

590
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:19,600
Speaker 0: It was done by Studio Nut.

591
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:20,899
Speaker 0: I don't know what else they did.

592
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,740
Speaker 0: And then it's a Funimation thing.

593
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,503
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

594
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,039
Speaker 1: They did storyboards on Arslan.

595
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:38,498
Speaker 0: OK, the legal way to watch it in the United States would be on Funimation or Hulu and the illegal way would be to pirate it.

596
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:41,340
Speaker 0: And those are the only ways you're going to see in the U.S.

597
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,702
Speaker 0: right now.

598
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,380
Speaker 0: I don't think it's on a DVD of any kind or a Booray.

599
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think so either.

600
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:47,699
Speaker 1: It wasn't on any platform that I had like easily set up.

601
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:50,040
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I also don't know if it's dubbed.

602
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,055
Speaker 0: I watched it subbed.

603
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really watch dubbed anime.

604
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:54,249
Speaker 1: No, you can't.

605
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,775
Speaker 1: I just don't.

606
00:35:56,001 --> 00:36:03,680
Speaker 0: OK, so it's really hard to talk about the show without spoiling, because this show is heavily laden with anime tropes.

607
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,441
Speaker 0: I'm going to list so many tropes that get to the point where I list all the tropes it has.

608
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:21,660
Speaker 0: But one of the tropes it, of course, has is our favorite terrible secret of space where, you know, there is like all these questions constantly there in your face while these other things are happening and they're answering other questions.

609
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:24,520
Speaker 0: But there's these big questions like what's really going on in the world?

610
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,960
Speaker 0: How does this world darker than black?

611
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,258
Speaker 1: What's outside that wall?

612
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:29,978
Speaker 1: What's the key of the twilight?

613
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,041
Speaker 0: Right.

614
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:34,849
Speaker 0: The characters are in the dark about the what the truth of the world that they live in.

615
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,359
Speaker 0: Right.

616
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,180
Speaker 0: They don't understand the reality that they are under and neither do you.

617
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,579
Speaker 0: But it will be revealed to you before it is to them.

618
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:41,881
Speaker 0: Right.

619
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:50,901
Speaker 1: Now, some shows the end of the show or at least the end of a season or like the middle episode of the show will be like, here is the answer to the terrible secret of space.

620
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:54,680
Speaker 1: And if it's the end of the show, that's the plot or it happens in the middle.

621
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:57,799
Speaker 1: And that sets the stage for the final arc of the show.

622
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:06,400
Speaker 1: This show kind of reveals the secret, like so by the end of the first episode, you rims only seen four episodes, right?

623
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:14,300
Speaker 0: So they reveal quite a large secret of space in episode like two, one that would have been sufficient.

624
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:15,904
Speaker 0: That would be right.

625
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,195
Speaker 0: One that would have been a normal anime show.

626
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,438
Speaker 0: ending reveal of that's how the world really works.

627
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:23,587
Speaker 0: Right.

628
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:24,659
Speaker 0: And there's only 12 episodes.

629
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,460
Speaker 1: Right.

630
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:32,672
Speaker 0: So they reveal like a bombshell in episode two and then they continue to bombshell.

631
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:33,260
Speaker 1: Right.

632
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,285
Speaker 1: By episode four, I had been hit with a second bombshell and Scott's already telling me before the show.

633
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,100
Speaker 1: Oh, you haven't even read anything yet.

634
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:41,521
Speaker 0: Right.

635
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:48,082
Speaker 0: So, for example, in episode nine, I'm going to you know, in episode nine, they do a thing.

636
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:51,897
Speaker 0: There is a climactic event, right, that occurs in episode nine.

637
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,760
Speaker 0: that would normally be in another anime, the end of the show.

638
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,140
Speaker 0: It is so climactic.

639
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,720
Speaker 0: That's like, oh, well, Dave, Dave, that's got to be the end of the show, right?

640
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,620
Speaker 0: There is three more episodes left.

641
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,959
Speaker 0: That is a 12 episode show.

642
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,541
Speaker 0: Guess what?

643
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:17,360
Speaker 0: Twenty five percent of the show remains after a climactic event that would end any other normal and like Evangelion, like the third impact.

644
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,203
Speaker 1: Happens.

645
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,560
Speaker 1: And then there's still five more episodes.

646
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,140
Speaker 0: Right.

647
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,871
Speaker 0: So the only way in a show such as this where literally you're getting, you know, anything you discuss whatsoever is going to spoil.

648
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:30,580
Speaker 0: not, you know, tons.

649
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:31,720
Speaker 0: I don't care about spoilers.

650
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:32,163
Speaker 0: Right.

651
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:35,822
Speaker 0: Personally, but not going to spoil it for you because you're going to go watch this, I guess.

652
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:45,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would only discuss the show in a non spoiler way if I only speak in generalities and nonspecifics.

653
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,846
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess we could.

654
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:49,920
Speaker 1: at the very end, we'll see how we want to approach it.

655
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,090
Speaker 0: The problem is, is I can't, you know, I have to.

656
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,688
Speaker 0: if we go to spoiler territory, I got to let you take the lead.

657
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:55,840
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I'll put it this way.

658
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:59,560
Speaker 1: So when I start watching the show, it looks like a pretty standard anime.

659
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:09,740
Speaker 1: I was getting some Fullmetal Alchemist vibes in terms of like the rough like level of quality, like what the characters are like, like it just felt like that kind of show.

660
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,680
Speaker 1: And I was getting into it like if there had been no terrible secret or space at all, I think I would have been interested in the show anyway.

661
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,979
Speaker 1: I might have actually kept watching.

662
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:31,343
Speaker 1: So then at the end of the first episode, it like cuts to a scene that is really weird looking, like a very different style, and it doesn't explain anything in the episode ends.

663
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:32,520
Speaker 1: And you're like, wait, wait, what?

664
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,342
Speaker 1: What was that?

665
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:43,460
Speaker 1: And then episode two backs up and explains what the deal is with that, which is already a bigger, terrible secret space than most anime will ever have.

666
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:45,260
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

667
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,200
Speaker 1: And then it just keeps going from there.

668
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:59,260
Speaker 1: And what I like is that the characters cross all these like these like weird demarcations of what the show looks like and is about.

669
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:02,640
Speaker 1: And the characters are themselves pretty compelling and interesting.

670
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm trying to think of how we can explain the two styles and how significant they are to the show without spoiling it.

671
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,500
Speaker 0: Right.

672
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:13,420
Speaker 0: So imagine you had an anime that took place on two planets.

673
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:14,619
Speaker 0: It's not this, not this one.

674
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,204
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:21,240
Speaker 0: And one planet was drawn in an art deco style by one set of artists.

676
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:25,400
Speaker 0: And the other the other planet was drawn in an art nouveau style.

677
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:25,842
Speaker 0: Right.

678
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:26,979
Speaker 0: A completely different art style.

679
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:27,806
Speaker 0: Right.

680
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:28,540
Speaker 0: Doesn't even match.

681
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,579
Speaker 0: You think they're two different shows, but they're actually just two different places in the same show.

682
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:35,362
Speaker 0: Right.

683
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:39,119
Speaker 0: Two different sets of characters who live in the different places because they're two different alien races.

684
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:39,863
Speaker 0: Right.

685
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,220
Speaker 0: And they're just drawn completely differently.

686
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:42,622
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:51,636
Speaker 0: Like you hired, you know, you know, you know what, you hired Studio Ghibli to draw the first planet and you hired, you know, to draw the second.

688
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:53,947
Speaker 1: Keklos.

689
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:54,979
Speaker 0: Keklos does that.

690
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:57,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're right.

691
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:06,060
Speaker 1: The different the Spartans are drawn differently than the, you know, you've got the stop motion and Greek statues and then you've got the Yamashibai.

692
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:08,620
Speaker 1: look in 2D like limited animation characters.

693
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:09,685
Speaker 0: Exactly.

694
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,440
Speaker 0: So that's what's going on in this show.

695
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:15,180
Speaker 0: Is that there are two sets of characters kind of.

696
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,581
Speaker 0: Right.

697
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,480
Speaker 0: And they're drawn in completely different art styles.

698
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:26,180
Speaker 0: The main characters that you're going to start to see at the start of episode one are drawn in a sort of generic anime kind of way for 2020.

699
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,262
Speaker 0: Yep.

700
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:26,920
Speaker 1: They look good though.

701
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,020
Speaker 1: Like they're good character designs.

702
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,921
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:33,080
Speaker 0: And these other characters are drawn like cute little cartoon characters.

704
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,360
Speaker 0: They look like they're from like a kids show or something.

705
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,505
Speaker 0: You know, they're very like.

706
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:40,623
Speaker 0: they're toys that you would buy at like the kid robot store or something.

707
00:41:41,426 --> 00:41:41,908
Speaker 0: But they are.

708
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:45,728
Speaker 0: it's almost like a Roger Rabbit only instead of live action plus cartoon.

709
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,399
Speaker 0: It's cartoon plus different cartoon.

710
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:50,820
Speaker 0: And they're, you know, together in the same story.

711
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:06,458
Speaker 0: And it's kind of I think for a person who's not an animation person that just the visual contrast there, I don't think I think a non anime person that have a hard time just seeing past that.

712
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:07,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could.

713
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:08,580
Speaker 1: I could definitely see that.

714
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:16,260
Speaker 0: I could see someone taking the shows and taking the show seriously, because like the story of the show, it's not a silly story.

715
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,078
Speaker 0: It's a serious sci fi action.

716
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

717
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:25,780
Speaker 1: Like the like the opening scene like that set before you actually start watching the show almost feels like a scene out of like Jurassic Park.

718
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:27,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

719
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:29,840
Speaker 1: In terms of what goes down and why.

720
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:43,139
Speaker 0: And then especially the kid robot style characters, if they are doing something very serious, but just the way they look, it's not like Oh, kaburagi that voice, the main dude's voice is a very good voice.

721
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:44,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

722
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,000
Speaker 0: You'll notice there's a lot of voice actors in this.

723
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:57,506
Speaker 0: You've heard before there's them, you know, in every studio trigger anime, there's usually like a really loud, like squeaky, small, usually female, you know, female character.

724
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:58,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

725
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Speaker 0: It was like, you know, that character is that voice actor is also voicing a similar character in this show, even though it is not a studio trigger joint.

726
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:22,379
Speaker 0: So, yeah, but yeah, seeing the characters with the not serious cartoony art style engaging in serious drama, I think will be a miss for a lot of people who are not anime animation people.

727
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:23,682
Speaker 1: Yeah.

728
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:29,447
Speaker 1: Also, because the character interactions like it actually has a surprisingly low anime attacks.

729
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:35,160
Speaker 1: otherwise, like the characters are normal, like the characters interact in interesting ways.

730
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,520
Speaker 1: The voice acting is really good.

731
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,899
Speaker 1: There aren't like weird fan service bits.

732
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's literally the.

733
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,839
Speaker 0: I think the only thing that's an anime text is that.

734
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,097
Speaker 0: OK, so the other thing about this show is that it is like I said before, it is laden with anime tropes.

735
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:51,280
Speaker 0: Right.

736
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:59,500
Speaker 0: So the first trope you see immediately is, of course, the trope of, you know, there are secrets in this world, precursors, you know, whatever.

737
00:43:59,640 --> 00:43:59,923
Speaker 0: Right.

738
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,520
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's terrible secret to space.

739
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:05,380
Speaker 0: There is this thing that has become popular.

740
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:11,580
Speaker 0: I think Attack on Titan made it popular where you fight using some sort of backpack that has like a weapon attached to it.

741
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,343
Speaker 0: There's been at least.

742
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:19,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is a big Attack on Titan vibe when they're actually fighting with the big monsters outside of the city.

743
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:32,875
Speaker 1: It's got the trope of we're in a we're in a ship or of some kind and it's us against the world with like a man center in the ship and like deploy like almost like a gundam kind of gundam.

744
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:38,319
Speaker 0: Well, it's more like Macross, right, where the people live inside the giant robot.

745
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,202
Speaker 0: that is enormous.

746
00:44:40,325 --> 00:44:48,130
Speaker 0: But the giant robot also transforms and fights and it has, you know, a bridge and it's it now has.

747
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,370
Speaker 1: we have to change things because the the most powerful punch is one punch, man.

748
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:51,939
Speaker 1: That doesn't count.

749
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:54,219
Speaker 1: The most powerful punch, that's not one punch, man.

750
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,721
Speaker 0: Up until this point had been the big oh, big oh, or I guess Mazinger also is a rocket punch.

751
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:01,142
Speaker 0: Yeah.

752
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:04,531
Speaker 0: So I think, but the this is the.

753
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:10,220
Speaker 1: this is the big oh, I imagine if the Macross ship did the big oh punch is what happens.

754
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,923
Speaker 1: It does.

755
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,539
Speaker 1: I imagine that because that's literally what happens.

756
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:21,060
Speaker 0: The Macross ship has the the Daedalus attack because its right arm is actually just like is it a battleship or an aircraft carrier?

757
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,100
Speaker 0: And it's called the Daedalus, right?

758
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,480
Speaker 0: They attached it to the Macross.

759
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,959
Speaker 0: It's not an alien ship like the Macross is.

760
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:37,780
Speaker 0: And then it punches the alien ship right in the front and then they open the bay in the front of it and all the robots are just like launch all their missiles after they punch inside the hull of the enemy.

761
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,279
Speaker 0: Anyway, Macross spoilers.

762
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:52,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a. there's a big fight where you start out like a gundam or Macross fight where there's like, you know, that trope where there's people in like a command center shouting orders like open the thing, do the thing, communicating with each other.

763
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,120
Speaker 0: Right.

764
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,180
Speaker 0: This show, OK, this show also has the trope of a Godzilla movie.

765
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:00,722
Speaker 0: Right.

766
00:46:00,762 --> 00:46:06,778
Speaker 0: There's basically there's an episode where they're fighting a very large monster like Godzilla sized.

767
00:46:07,622 --> 00:46:17,959
Speaker 0: And you know how in a Godzilla movie, there's always that part where Godzilla is sleeping and you're waiting and then and then they're preparing and doing all this stuff and then wait for it to wake up again.

768
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,341
Speaker 0: Right.

769
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,700
Speaker 0: It is like there's an episode that's basically a Godzilla movie.

770
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:22,634
Speaker 0: The episode.

771
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:22,818
Speaker 0: Yeah.

772
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:27,500
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like I could probably keep going on with this more and more.

773
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:34,699
Speaker 0: It's like you're going to see in this show basically so many other anime just like incorporated together.

774
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:35,542
Speaker 0: Right.

775
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:40,100
Speaker 0: You know, like these key pieces of just well trodden territory.

776
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:53,074
Speaker 0: But then what they do to just, you know, to make this not just another anime is each and every one of those normal old anime things are a obviously combined into one show, which is interesting.

777
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:53,400
Speaker 0: Right.

778
00:46:53,761 --> 00:47:10,882
Speaker 0: But B, like we said, with the constant, you know, pushing to the next terrible secret of space after the previous one and, you know, going further is they push each and every one of those troops like farther than you could have imagined it being possible to push them.

779
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:11,123
Speaker 0: Right.

780
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:13,397
Speaker 0: So it's like if I took a lemon and it's like everyone knows.

781
00:47:13,437 --> 00:47:14,261
Speaker 0: a lemon tastes like.

782
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:14,542
Speaker 0: Right.

783
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:19,627
Speaker 0: And I squeeze it all out and you look at that lemon and you say that lemon is bone dry.

784
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,060
Speaker 0: That's the Godzilla movie lemon.

785
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,480
Speaker 0: We've seen everything we could see from a Godzilla movie.

786
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,100
Speaker 0: There is nothing left to get from there.

787
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,031
Speaker 0: And we know what it tastes like.

788
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:26,840
Speaker 0: It tastes like lemon.

789
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,621
Speaker 0: Right.

790
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:34,060
Speaker 0: Decadence comes over and grabs this dry ass lemon rind and squeezes it.

791
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,361
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:38,560
Speaker 0: And what comes out is still just more lemon juice.

793
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,815
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste any different.

794
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:40,079
Speaker 0: Right.

795
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:44,720
Speaker 0: But like a whole extra glass of lemon juice comes out and you're like, what the fuck?

796
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,688
Speaker 0: How did you get?

797
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:46,255
Speaker 0: Right.

798
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,480
Speaker 0: It's like that guy slapping the hood of the car.

799
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:50,700
Speaker 0: I can fit X whatever here.

800
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,041
Speaker 0: Right.

801
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:54,520
Speaker 0: It's like somehow they've taken this old hat trope.

802
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:55,422
Speaker 0: Right.

803
00:47:55,583 --> 00:48:03,559
Speaker 0: Of normal old anime stuff, stuff you've seen before, stuff you know so well and they haven't changed the way it tastes.

804
00:48:03,762 --> 00:48:04,939
Speaker 0: It's the same old anime.

805
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,978
Speaker 0: They just got more out of it.

806
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,939
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, wow.

807
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:09,565
Speaker 0: Look at that.

808
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,292
Speaker 0: How did you do that?

809
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,766
Speaker 1: In fact, you know, another thing it does.

810
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:21,365
Speaker 1: that I appreciate, because Big O did this sort of retroactively, all the little detail, like background details, like really minor stuff.

811
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,398
Speaker 1: Utena did this too.

812
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:31,716
Speaker 1: Anime looking things that you might just ignore in a show like, oh, they just drew that thing that way because it's anime that seems to always end up mattering.

813
00:48:32,438 --> 00:48:33,000
Speaker 1: specifically.

814
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:41,000
Speaker 1: Like there's a scene in the very beginning where the girl is like, I want to I want to be a fighter out fighting the Godalls like those people over there.

815
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:45,483
Speaker 1: And you see those people and they have like radically different colored skin for everyone else.

816
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:48,580
Speaker 1: And they're like like neon hair and they just kind of look crazy.

817
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:54,880
Speaker 1: And the explanation you're given is that, oh, they're part of this warrior case, like they're a different type of person.

818
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:57,720
Speaker 1: And it is true that they're a different type of person.

819
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:58,900
Speaker 1: But that is a spoiler.

820
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:03,600
Speaker 1: But that detail is just like two seconds of screen time.

821
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:19,123
Speaker 0: Well, at least at that point in the show, I can definitely tell you that is as someone who's seen the whole show, I can tell you there is I mean, other than, you know, your suspension of disbelief because you're watching a fictional anime and a fantasy sci-fi world.

822
00:49:19,204 --> 00:49:27,540
Speaker 0: Other than that, it is extremely tight on terms of plot holes and every single thing you see matters and make sense.

823
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,460
Speaker 1: I really appreciate that in a show.

824
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,364
Speaker 0: And there are.

825
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,980
Speaker 0: no there's not a lot of loose thread hanging at the end.

826
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:41,800
Speaker 1: I was not left at the end with any questions of like, hey, what about the something something like at the end of Fullmetal Alchemist, the original show, we were like, all right, so now what the fuck?

827
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,440
Speaker 1: You didn't answer like any of my questions.

828
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,245
Speaker 0: Exactly.

829
00:49:44,285 --> 00:49:45,500
Speaker 0: That will not happen with this show.

830
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:50,420
Speaker 0: The the negative thing I can say about this show is that being 12 episodes, it's good.

831
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,712
Speaker 0: It moves right along.

832
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,440
Speaker 0: It moves maybe.

833
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,386
Speaker 0: Right.

834
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:55,180
Speaker 0: It doesn't feel like it's going too fast.

835
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:59,720
Speaker 0: It's just like steadily hitting really hard constantly.

836
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:11,680
Speaker 0: But the characters, other than the two most main characters, all of the other characters are not given a lot of time and or development.

837
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,160
Speaker 0: Ones that get time early, get almost no time late.

838
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,580
Speaker 0: Ones that get time late are not given time early.

839
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:31,820
Speaker 0: So it kind of changes over the show, which characters are getting more time and all the characters, other than the main ones, basically have like one thread that's theirs is very shallow and is, you know, resolved.

840
00:50:33,102 --> 00:50:39,780
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, I guess in episode one, it's like the main character, the girl has like a friend in school or like it's orphanage school.

841
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:40,082
Speaker 0: Right.

842
00:50:40,685 --> 00:50:43,480
Speaker 0: And so that's a side character, that school friend from episode one.

843
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:43,861
Speaker 0: Yeah.

844
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:44,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

845
00:50:44,162 --> 00:50:50,880
Speaker 0: That school friend from episode one, you see briefly a few times when they interact a few seconds here and there.

846
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,180
Speaker 0: And then the plot with that character is wrapped up in a couple scenes of drama.

847
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:58,259
Speaker 0: And then that's pretty much it.

848
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:04,000
Speaker 0: It's and you get pretty much that amount of stuff from each character.

849
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:12,819
Speaker 1: Which is a shame because, you know, going back to the sort of Full Metal Alchemist energy, what I like about that show was that the side characters were all great and got a lot of screen time.

850
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:17,483
Speaker 0: And you start to like, well, I had more episodes and more manga pages to work with right here.

851
00:51:17,986 --> 00:51:20,380
Speaker 0: Each each side character is very one note.

852
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,140
Speaker 0: Like, here's their deal, their deal, you know, the first one.

853
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, they.

854
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:25,660
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

855
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,482
Speaker 0: Here's their deal.

856
00:51:26,764 --> 00:51:31,643
Speaker 0: They get a scene maybe right where you you write to maybe show you who they are.

857
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:34,680
Speaker 0: And then at some point their deal gets sort of resolved.

858
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:40,616
Speaker 0: And any other time you see them, if they do get more screen time, they're just sort of being who they are.

859
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:40,920
Speaker 0: Right.

860
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,960
Speaker 0: So like loud guy who likes to fight.

861
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,239
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, he's got a scene that wraps up his shit.

862
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:49,060
Speaker 0: He's got an introduction scene and every other scene he's in, which is quite a few.

863
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,419
Speaker 0: He's just being a loud guy who likes to fight.

864
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,560
Speaker 0: You know, he is not developing or have any, you know, interesting things going on.

865
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,740
Speaker 0: And there's several characters other than the two main ones.

866
00:52:01,142 --> 00:52:03,800
Speaker 0: But all of the other ones just sort of follow that thing.

867
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,687
Speaker 0: This is a show that is not about.

868
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,479
Speaker 0: at least it's about the two main characters and it's about the plot of the world.

869
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:12,620
Speaker 0: It's not about the other characters.

870
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:15,640
Speaker 0: They're just sort of filling in, you know, where characters are needed.

871
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is fine, because what I've seen so far, the world is plenty of meat.

872
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,840
Speaker 1: It's like a Thanksgiving buffet where I can't eat everything.

873
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,600
Speaker 1: It would be too much if it had everything, unless it was just longer.

874
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:30,380
Speaker 1: But then it might not hit as hard in terms of the density of the terrible secrets.

875
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:44,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if you made this as the thing is like the show is weird and that if you made it longer, you could give respect to those other characters, some of which could become really interesting and awesome characters if you did like having like just an episode where the main plot doesn't advance.

876
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:45,263
Speaker 0: Right.

877
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:52,499
Speaker 0: But they go fighting some bad guys or something and you spend that time, you know, developing or learning about some of these other characters in the show.

878
00:52:53,782 --> 00:52:57,020
Speaker 0: But by having every episode be a heavy plot episode.

879
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:57,983
Speaker 0: Right.

880
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:00,580
Speaker 0: It moves along in a different way.

881
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:10,540
Speaker 1: Well, you know, look at Attack on Titan is a good example of that, because that's the opposite of this in that it really, really, really focuses on the characters and like them doesn't move along.

882
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:14,300
Speaker 1: And the terrible secrets of space come like once every season.

883
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

884
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:20,839
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I think that's the balance that they struck here.

885
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,561
Speaker 0: Right.

886
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:25,540
Speaker 0: And I think if it wasn't 12 episodes, I don't think I want to watch the whole thing, you know.

887
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,517
Speaker 1: Unless imagine if it was just 12 more episodes of continuing secrets of space somehow.

888
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:33,719
Speaker 0: That I don't think that could happen.

889
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,300
Speaker 0: You could do more episodes, but I don't think it ends pretty solidly.

890
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,784
Speaker 0: Right.

891
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:39,138
Speaker 0: At least.

892
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:48,540
Speaker 0: I think if you wanted to continue this, I guess this isn't spoilers, you would have to go to a far away place in the same universe.

893
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:54,140
Speaker 0: You could not really do much more writing in the same characters, same place.

894
00:53:55,763 --> 00:54:01,899
Speaker 0: After the end of the show, you have to go to like, you know, another side of another planet, another galaxy, something, you know, something else.

895
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:03,403
Speaker 0: Right.

896
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:08,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what would I say about the show as a whole?

897
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:10,360
Speaker 0: I don't think it's actually like an A anime.

898
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't feeling that even from the beginning because I've seen some A anime recently.

899
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:40,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, my feeling is like this is a B plus anime, but because it has unique qualities and because it is so short, only four hours long for the whole series, that I think it's actually worth, if you're an anime fan, right, an anime person, there's a lot, you know, if you've already seen the top tier animes, you got four hours to do nothing.

900
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,439
Speaker 0: You're stuck at home all the time.

901
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:43,340
Speaker 0: Why not watch this?

902
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:44,820
Speaker 0: It's perfectly enjoyable.

903
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,938
Speaker 0: I don't regret spending four hours on it.

904
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,760
Speaker 1: B plus is the level of like a scrapped princess.

905
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,897
Speaker 0: Like pretty good show.

906
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:53,599
Speaker 0: Like this is better than Scrap Princess for sure.

907
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,519
Speaker 1: You didn't even watch all the Scrap Princess.

908
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,722
Speaker 0: That's right.

909
00:54:56,943 --> 00:55:00,700
Speaker 1: How far did you even get into Scrap Princess?

910
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:02,500
Speaker 0: A four or five episode.

911
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,699
Speaker 0: I don't remember it that well.

912
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,360
Speaker 0: The point is, you know, this is a show that's well worth watching.

913
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,419
Speaker 0: It will not become a legendary anime of all time.

914
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:19,440
Speaker 1: I feel like we might talk about it in a panel someday on the terrible secret of space or like the mid-season.

915
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:20,525
Speaker 0: I think it has.

916
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:22,012
Speaker 0: I think it has a lot of.

917
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:30,341
Speaker 0: I don't think it has the kind of staying power where it's going to be a show that is like must watch like everyone's putting it on their lists.

918
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:36,824
Speaker 0: But I think it's a show that will sort of, you know, it will come it will come back up.

919
00:55:36,844 --> 00:55:38,340
Speaker 0: People in discussions.

920
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:39,203
Speaker 0: Right.

921
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,040
Speaker 0: It will have some relevance and be brought back up.

922
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:54,820
Speaker 0: And someone who's you know, if any if you're into anime any deeper than you just watch Akira and Ghost in the Shell and Miyazaki movies, if you're on the next level where you're like an anime fan, this show should be one that you that you watch.

923
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.

924
00:55:55,705 --> 00:55:56,269
Speaker 1: I'm going to.

925
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,316
Speaker 1: I'm definitely going to finish it.

926
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:04,538
Speaker 0: And because it's it's you know, it's kind of hard to surprise an anime fan who's seen many animes, right?

927
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I'd like kill la kill at that point.

928
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,220
Speaker 1: I'm even like, all right, nothing really surprised me here.

929
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,048
Speaker 1: I'm just into this.

930
00:56:11,978 --> 00:56:12,120
Speaker 0: Yep.

931
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,000
Speaker 0: So you got four hours decadence, you know, enjoy.

941
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:22,979
