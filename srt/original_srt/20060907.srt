1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,642
Speaker 1: It's Thursday September 7th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:16,650
Speaker 1: We discuss how to not suck at talking.

3
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:21,034
Speaker 0: Let's do this Today at work.

4
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:25,070
Speaker 0: I had the privilege of going to one of those places most people only see in the movies.

5
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:40,550
Speaker 0: I went to the Bronx regional high school, which is one of those stereotypical inner-city high schools And I worked at the clinic there on the computers and the well more Specifically the closet where the routers and switches go, what's it like there?

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,276
Speaker 1: I mean it can't be that bad if they have routers.

7
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:46,572
Speaker 0: and here's the thing it looked exactly like in all those movies about troubled youths In the inner city.

8
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:53,982
Speaker 0: you know the school was really locked down on the outside bars everywhere, and there were guards at the doors and Everything was real.

9
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:58,143
Speaker 0: you know Everything was really locked down, but every student.

10
00:00:58,303 --> 00:00:59,649
Speaker 0: I ran into and I was during class.

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:26,341
Speaker 0: I was walking through the halls trying to find the clinic area and Aside to the fact that I walked past one student who was showing off her baby to a number of other students Mm-hmm high school mind you yeah, but aside from that I all the punk kids I ran into were typical bright looking normal punk kids and all the teachers seem to be teaching normal classes, and it seemed Exactly like any other high school I'd been to even to the fact that they seem to have plenty of money.

12
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:31,729
Speaker 0: they had plenty of computers like all the textbooks I saw look brand new and everything looked really nice.

13
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,878
Speaker 1: See this is what I keep telling people that you know it.

14
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:40,110
Speaker 1: just because you grew up somewhere where you have inner city schools Doesn't mean you can't learn anything.

15
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,475
Speaker 1: It's all about how much you try.

16
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:42,720
Speaker 0: and well see the thing is I don't.

17
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:52,184
Speaker 0: I don't know what they were actually teaching and I saw A small wing of the school, and I'll note that there was another wing of the school That was locked from that side like from the side.

18
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:53,530
Speaker 0: I was in to the other side.

19
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,450
Speaker 0: I don't know if maybe all the troublemakers were in that side.

20
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,589
Speaker 1: Yeah Those are the kids who shouldn't be in school in the first place because they don't want to be and they're not gonna learn anything.

21
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:01,719
Speaker 1: no How good the school is.

22
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:02,829
Speaker 0: here's the problem with that?

23
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,390
Speaker 0: Most I'd say most kids don't want to be in school when they're very young.

24
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,810
Speaker 0: I didn't want to be in school for much of my schooling.

25
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:14,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean you know there's a lot of kids Or you know there are kids where if you expel them they go yay, and there are other kids.

26
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,939
Speaker 1: You you expel them, and they go.

27
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,227
Speaker 1: no my life is what.

28
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:17,690
Speaker 1: what's the line?

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,687
Speaker 0: I mean if you expelled me when I was in first grade I would have thought that was the best thing that ever happened to me And I would have spent the rest of my life playing and looking at pictures and books hey.

30
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,035
Speaker 1: Hey, no you wouldn't He could.

31
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:31,484
Speaker 0: it's eventually become a homeless bum Yeah, and then I would have had the same books to look at.

32
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:41,011
Speaker 0: cuz I couldn't buy new picture books Yeah, and I'd learn how to read the words night train fortified wine MD 2020.

33
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:49,252
Speaker 0: Anyway real quick before we get into the news and everything I have a short short short geek back from our good friend and scientist Lisa Mm-hmm.

34
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:54,872
Speaker 0: I just want to say I want you to know or when I'm reading the wrong quote because I have a quote from my news Article as well.

35
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:55,555
Speaker 1: Oh good job.

36
00:02:56,017 --> 00:03:06,914
Speaker 0: I think your bamboo problem was bacillus Pumulus basilisk as in turns bacillus as in a little bacteria Not a snake.

37
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:07,395
Speaker 1: the B?

38
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,558
Speaker 0: a ci?

39
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,020
Speaker 0: ll?

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,862
Speaker 0: u s p?

41
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:10,404
Speaker 0: u m?

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:10,645
Speaker 0: i?

43
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:10,865
Speaker 0: l?

44
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,390
Speaker 1: u s so maybe it's bacillus.

45
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:14,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, that of bacillus.

46
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,022
Speaker 0: I've heard things like that said either way.

47
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,890
Speaker 0: I'm sure Pete and Lisa will correct both of us.

48
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:30,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure yeah But she is pretty certain that that is it because it's a small bacteria found commonly in dirt thrives in water smells like vomit and she is 100% confident that it smells like vomit.

49
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:34,386
Speaker 1: Well, um that seems to fit the description perfectly.

50
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd bet money on it.

51
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,221
Speaker 0: I will assume that the problem was in fact this tiny little bacteria.

52
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,030
Speaker 1: Can we get some of this bacteria to use on people?

53
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,918
Speaker 0: What do you mean use on people?

54
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,015
Speaker 0: It'd be easier just to vomit on people But it didn't smell.

55
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,862
Speaker 1: a vomit doesn't smell as bad as bacillus.

56
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:49,504
Speaker 1: I heard is.

57
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:50,990
Speaker 0: I could make you some vomit.

58
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:52,252
Speaker 0: We'll get it.

59
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:54,943
Speaker 0: We'll get a still we'll make some concentrated vomit.

60
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:55,545
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

61
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,290
Speaker 0: Oh, no We'll get a bag of vomit and leave it in the washroom for a week or two.

62
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,110
Speaker 0: Okay, as long as the acid doesn't eat through the bag.

63
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,597
Speaker 1: Anyway Let's cut the disgusting.

64
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:10,663
Speaker 0: Let's get on to the news.

65
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:26,690
Speaker 1: We have a pretty good topic today All right, so we told you a while ago that some guy broke the fair use for WM Thingy, which allows you to take the DRM off of fair play protected music files.

66
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:39,930
Speaker 1: So though that includes, you know music you buy from Napster and Yahoo and some other places that can be played on Microsoft's Windows Media Player some other players and any plays for sure device.

67
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:48,650
Speaker 1: Um, so of course Microsoft put out a patch so that fair use for WM doesn't work anymore.

68
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,270
Speaker 0: No, I thought Microsoft only put out patches on Black Tuesday.

69
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:59,150
Speaker 1: They usually do only put out patches on Black Tuesday, which is the second Tuesday of every month.

70
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:04,539
Speaker 1: You know, that's the typical thing is the second Tuesday of every month Microsoft will put a whole mess of patches out.

71
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,522
Speaker 1: you go to Windows Update.

72
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,265
Speaker 1: You'll be all gay.

73
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:07,329
Speaker 1: Yeah all good.

74
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:09,808
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I guess my.

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,743
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know why I said that but I'm really curious.

76
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:14,969
Speaker 1: I don't know whether it's you know.

77
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:22,390
Speaker 0: I just know that today I've listened to two radio people say a euphemism for homosexuality instead of their intended word.

78
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:24,077
Speaker 1: It's a virus.

79
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:32,067
Speaker 0: It's going around his pendulum And he said the word fag and then he stopped and he said I didn't mean to say that word.

80
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:37,765
Speaker 1: I meant to say Yeah Well, he must have been talking about a cigarette.

81
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:40,374
Speaker 1: He's British, you know Okay.

82
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:51,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is is that Microsoft usually patches everything including Extremely dangerous security vulnerabilities in its software on the second Tuesday of every month.

83
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,870
Speaker 0: So if a horrible vulnerability so if there's a virus going around the internet destroying everything and it comes out on that Wednesday You've got to wait a whole month.

84
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:06,589
Speaker 1: You got to wait a whole month before you're getting able to defend against it unless you have some sort of other company within any virus protecting you somehow.

85
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:22,878
Speaker 1: so someone broke the DRM on Windows Media files and Within three days, which is faster than Microsoft has ever released a patch ever They put out a patch to fix these holes.

86
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,004
Speaker 1: Of course, it didn't work for long.

87
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:29,470
Speaker 1: fair use for WM version 1.2 Basically makes the patch useless.

88
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:43,030
Speaker 1: And now there's gonna be this very long firefight in which you know fair use for WM upgrades and then Microsoft patches and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and I have a feeling fair use for DRM is gonna win.

89
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:50,124
Speaker 1: I just had this feeling yeah Yeah, I wouldn't bet against that but the point is you can tell who's really.

90
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,890
Speaker 1: you know controlling things at Microsoft.

91
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:55,413
Speaker 1: You know that they can dedicate resources To.

92
00:06:55,553 --> 00:07:04,223
Speaker 1: you know, making sure the record companies are happy that they can get a patch out in three days Whereas when is an extreme security vulnerability and a danger to the entire internet?

93
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:05,668
Speaker 1: Oh, it's okay.

94
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:06,390
Speaker 1: It could wait a month.

95
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,204
Speaker 1: it's no big deal because you know, that doesn't really hurt Microsoft's wallet so much.

96
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:15,036
Speaker 1: and Yeah Microsoft bad DRM bad.

97
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:15,418
Speaker 0: Yeah.

98
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,270
Speaker 0: Anyway, my news today is something it's been going around the internet for a while And I kind of ignored it because there's news like this all the time.

99
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,310
Speaker 0: But for some reason a lot of people have been talking about it.

100
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:26,801
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people.

101
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:37,470
Speaker 0: and then Recently, I discovered because I did a little bit of follow-up and I saw the final Consensus answer as to what was going on and this just really illustrates what bothers me about.

102
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,009
Speaker 0: You know people who are credulous of things when they really shouldn't be.

103
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:50,732
Speaker 0: There is a tree in San Antonio that one day started spouting water from a small hole on the side of it in great quantity Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:50,973 --> 00:08:05,909
Speaker 0: now interesting the people who own the property and the locals almost immediately began to believe that this was some sort of miracle water because one lady who was friends with the person who loaned the property said that she sprinkled the water on her spider bites and they disappeared.

105
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:16,776
Speaker 0: and Then another another woman associated with the homeowner said that she soaked her ankles which were arthritic in water from the tree and Their arthritis went away Uh-huh.

106
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there are all sorts of claims like this.

107
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,549
Speaker 0: So people were coming around and bottling up the water and you know, oh, it's miracle water keeping it protecting it.

108
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:33,270
Speaker 0: She called the state a few times, you know, hey test this I want to see what's up about that Which you think all right, maybe she's rational and she wants to you know, find out for sure what's going on.

109
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,049
Speaker 0: But I'll I'll destroy that little tiny burst of optimism a little bit.

110
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:41,774
Speaker 0: But first they have all these interviews and she's saying, you know It's miracle water miracle water.

111
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:46,250
Speaker 0: and then they talk to her son who says I don't believe any of that superstitious crap.

112
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:48,370
Speaker 0: And you think all right this kid's smart.

113
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:52,310
Speaker 0: But then he goes on to talk about how we think the water tastes better than the tap water.

114
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,189
Speaker 0: So he bottles it up and puts it in the fridge.

115
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:07,770
Speaker 0: so Eventually, you know some people come and they investigate and to make a long story short They discovered now despite the fact that everyone involved said there's no way it could be a burst pipe or anything because that just couldn't happen.

116
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:19,503
Speaker 0: There enough the tree one of its roots had Penetrated an old water pipe and the pressure had been forcing water through the tree where it then manifested at this hole in the middle of the truck.

117
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:27,310
Speaker 1: Oh Now the reason would have thought that that there was a perfectly rational bull, you know rational reasonable explanation.

118
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:28,594
Speaker 0: Now the reason they discovered this.

119
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:31,343
Speaker 1: the best part would have thought that people tested the water.

120
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:43,367
Speaker 0: Not only was it tap water but it was Filled with a very high Bacterial load probably because it was filtered through water and then a tree and that it was dangerous to drink.

121
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,470
Speaker 1: well dirt and then a tree.

122
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:48,138
Speaker 1: I mean the water It was dangerous to drink.

123
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:49,563
Speaker 1: Oh, good job.

124
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,770
Speaker 1: You smart people got what they deserved.

125
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:59,266
Speaker 0: Now the woman who said she wanted to get it tested and kept calling the state, you know Come and test this come and test this you might think.

126
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:03,490
Speaker 0: well She wants to find out what's going on because there's obviously rational explanation.

127
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:17,463
Speaker 0: Here is exactly why what she wanted the state of Texas to test for quotes, I just wanted to know if it was a healing tree or Miracle water.

128
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a difference somehow I don't know.

129
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,334
Speaker 0: I don't know ever.

130
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:36,870
Speaker 0: I can't believe that of so many people were suckered in by this and looking around the internet There are a lot of people who are still talking about how amazing this is now.

131
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, you scientist.

132
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:39,740
Speaker 0: You can't solve this one.

133
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:52,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just solved it in like a minute like the article I'm linking to came out before they discovered that it was a you know a pipe and The article is really kind of slanted toward the view that we can't solve it.

134
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,330
Speaker 0: It's a magical mystery.

135
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,330
Speaker 1: Just cuz he can't solve it doesn't mean we it just we haven't solved it yet.

136
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:13,084
Speaker 0: I guess I wish reporters would be far more incredulous when they talk to people because it seems that whenever reporter Interviews one of these people who says that their statue of I don't know Liam Neeson is bleeding through the eyes and they want you know, it's a miracle.

137
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,261
Speaker 0: I don't know why I picked Liam Neeson I don't know who that is.

138
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:20,263
Speaker 0: anyway Find their statue of Princess Leia.

139
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:24,761
Speaker 0: I know leading through the eyes We have a funny Princess Leia story, but that's neither here nor there.

140
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:25,504
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

141
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,589
Speaker 0: actually it's right over there.

142
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:38,696
Speaker 0: Yeah Reporters always interview the person as though it's true and they act as though everything that person says is true because they report it as though I'm Just reporting what this person said.

143
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:40,063
Speaker 0: It is not my place to judge them.

144
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,700
Speaker 0: I Really wish a reporter would ask the serious questions.

145
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,050
Speaker 0: Like wouldn't it make sense that this just penetrated a pipe?

146
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,350
Speaker 0: What makes you think that there's anything other than a rational explanation?

147
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,430
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it is is, you know on the news they pretty much have bad stories and good stories.

148
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,650
Speaker 1: You know a bad story is anything to do with national or international news at all is always negative.

149
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:03,779
Speaker 1: They get as negative as they possibly can.

150
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,848
Speaker 1: we're talking about anything out there.

151
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:09,362
Speaker 1: And whenever they talk about local news, that's not crime.

152
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:12,435
Speaker 1: They focus on the most positive thing They possibly can.

153
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:14,730
Speaker 1: they make it as positive as possible as all the fluff pieces.

154
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:23,025
Speaker 1: so the reporters, you know doing the local stuff are never gonna be negative about it because It's sort of like putting down your audience.

155
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,650
Speaker 1: It's like You know the peep the local stories.

156
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:27,022
Speaker 1: Those are the people watching the news.

157
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:27,949
Speaker 1: you're gonna go around.

158
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,850
Speaker 1: People are gonna watch the local news and see the news make fun of their neighbor or their friend down the road.

159
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,930
Speaker 1: They're not gonna like that, but they don't mind you making fun of you know, some guy in another country or some politician.

160
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,555
Speaker 0: Well, it's not just the local news.

161
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:41,358
Speaker 0: It's something.

162
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,482
Speaker 0: take the evolution debate.

163
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:44,910
Speaker 0: It's even though it's not really a debate.

164
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,107
Speaker 0: It's just one group of people yelling and other group of people ignoring them.

165
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:53,510
Speaker 0: But anyway It seems that the news always tries to appear fair and objective and balanced.

166
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:57,210
Speaker 0: So they always give equal weight to every argument, which is crazy.

167
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,710
Speaker 0: I mean say Scott Alex and I are arguing over whether or not the thing I'm holding in my hand is the DVD are.

168
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,304
Speaker 0: We look at it and all three of us agree.

169
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:07,750
Speaker 0: It says DVD are on it.

170
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,214
Speaker 0: It's obviously a DVD are.

171
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:16,162
Speaker 0: and then some hobo who escaped from the insane asylum up the road breaks in through the window and says That's not a DVD.

172
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:16,969
Speaker 0: are at the squirrel.

173
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:22,606
Speaker 0: But you don't need to even acknowledge the fact that the hobo said it was a squirrel.

174
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:28,350
Speaker 0: you and if you do You make sure to mention that this is a crazy hobo and not a DVD are expert.

175
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:29,736
Speaker 1: Well what you got her understand.

176
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:32,327
Speaker 1: the news doesn't care about giving the news properly.

177
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:33,130
Speaker 1: They care about ratings.

178
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:34,693
Speaker 1: There's one.

179
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,970
Speaker 1: I understand why there's a popular opinion, even if it's completely wrong.

180
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:46,770
Speaker 1: There'll be one-sided to the popular opinion and if there's an opinion that people debate on They'll try to be sort of fair so that no one gets mad at them.

181
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if there's an opinion that you know everyone believes the right thing then they'll report the right thing.

182
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:55,004
Speaker 0: You know that's unless they report the wrong thing just to generate controversy.

183
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,530
Speaker 0: so people watch to see what they're talking about.

184
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:03,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, generally what you do is don't watch the fucking shit mainstream news god damn is it worthless?

185
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:08,990
Speaker 0: yeah go to the Bloggers and places like geek nights instead because we have the real news.

186
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:17,576
Speaker 1: No the idea is to read as much information on the internet as you possibly can and sort it out for yourself Which doesn't work.

187
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:18,905
Speaker 1: if you're an idiot so step one.

188
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:19,570
Speaker 1: don't be an idiot.

189
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:26,872
Speaker 0: We should do a. how to not suck and not being an idiot show someday mmm next Thursday how to get the news truthfully as possible.

190
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,210
Speaker 0: things of the day.

191
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:44,465
Speaker 0: I Didn't give nearly as many hints as I probably could have as to my thing of the day one thing of the day Two things of the day and three things of the day.

192
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:49,342
Speaker 0: well just to just Nobody expects the third thing of the day because there isn't one.

193
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:51,950
Speaker 0: it's our fanatical devotion to the Pope anyway.

194
00:14:53,791 --> 00:15:02,958
Speaker 0: Now there were a lot of guesses to what my thing of the day is and I'm surprised no one guessed lemon party because naked men really Lemon parties what most people would think of.

195
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:06,210
Speaker 1: she just said it was lemon party and let them go see what lemon party.

196
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,078
Speaker 0: Don't go see what lemon party is though.

197
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:33,898
Speaker 0: It's probably the tamest of those things on the internet now, but the point is I gave a few hints there were a lot of guesses and Pretty much everyone in the front row crew knew immediately what I was talking about But no one else did and I don't think many people know about this and it's one of those things I really hope makes an internet resurgence because I find it to be one of the most philosophically inspiring videos I've seen on the internet in a long time.

198
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we saw this how many years ago at least two or three.

199
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:41,979
Speaker 0: It's pretty old may 2004 2003 perhaps and it spread like a virus.

200
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:48,090
Speaker 0: everyone who saw it showed it to everyone they could and Everyone who saw it then tried to spread it to more people.

201
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:55,847
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing you would expect You know like because there's a lot of old stuff that I saw a year or two ago is showing up on dig and gotten Really popular among all the people who haven't seen it yet.

202
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:59,610
Speaker 1: So I figure this one's gonna come back, but it hasn't yet.

203
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,070
Speaker 1: So maybe we can help it now.

204
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,030
Speaker 0: I'd suggest if you're at a computer that you stop listening right now and watch my thing of the day.

205
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:08,350
Speaker 0: It is called a heap of trouble.

206
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:11,242
Speaker 0: Yep, it's a short video now.

207
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:12,870
Speaker 0: I'll assume at this point that you've all watched it.

208
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:14,937
Speaker 1: Well, it's not safe for work by the way.

209
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:18,490
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there are naked men lots of them now.

210
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,433
Speaker 0: It is tastefully done.

211
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,643
Speaker 0: It is no worse than what you would expect from.

212
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:30,381
Speaker 0: I don't know a bunch of naked men walking down this road Causing a heap of trouble for all concerned.

213
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:44,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not like erotic It's just naked guys like a nude beach and not like a penthouse, but the video begins with typical suburban Scary, you know black hole Sun types kind of standing around.

214
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:58,719
Speaker 0: you know kids like playing in the in the street and a girl eating ice cream this nice cream man and all of the parents all of the adults are standing around and you can't really hear what they're saying, but it's definitely a Rabble rabble rabble rabble kind of thing, you know.

215
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,230
Speaker 0: Oh, how dare those blah blah blah blah blah blah?

216
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:12,888
Speaker 0: I'm all indignant cuz I live in the suburbs exactly and then everything stops because something is coming in the distance and Everyone starts getting really nervous and looking ahead.

217
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:20,412
Speaker 0: Three naked men and four naked men and five Naked.

218
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:26,470
Speaker 0: and eventually nine naked men just walking down the road Cause a heap of trouble.

219
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:34,250
Speaker 0: The lyrics are nine naked men just walking down the road will cause a heap of trouble for all concerned.

220
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:37,428
Speaker 0: Yes, nine naked men and it just repeats over and over again

221
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:42,478
Speaker 1: Occasionally they do the countdown, you know One two three four and then they just go back into the cars

222
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:50,376
Speaker 0: and sure enough over the horizon and around the corner come nine naked men Marching in a line singing this song.

223
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:55,850
Speaker 1: and I'm nine naked man of a rage of ages ages and body types.

224
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,836
Speaker 1: No, not pleasant to behold.

225
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,668
Speaker 0: This does not go over well with the simple townsfolk.

226
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:04,956
Speaker 0: They Start in various ways freaking out.

227
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:17,124
Speaker 0: the first a bunch of little kids like leg it and they run and the mother like freaks out And like starts grabbing the kids and trying to drag them inside now and the ice cream man is like oh shit He's like hiding in his thing.

228
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:22,685
Speaker 0: But then One of the men the dad the dad of the primary family in the video.

229
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:32,492
Speaker 0: He doesn't run away he stands there staring at them and He has this inspired look on his face and he slowly puts his daughter down and you know it cuts to.

230
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:47,085
Speaker 0: it cuts to everyone else running around and you know panicking and then it keeps coming back to him and he's Staring want only and slowly unbuttoned in his shirt At which point his wife and children see him and they physically drag him into the house.

231
00:18:47,507 --> 00:19:02,589
Speaker 0: while they're dragging him in he keep you like you hear him saying like no naked Down the road like he's trying to sing it and it's trying to get out of him and they drag him into the house And it keeps cutting different panicking and then it cuts to the naked man and they start marching by singing their song and they're

232
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,526
Speaker 1: still Wearing socks and shoes, which is way cool

233
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:12,225
Speaker 0: Not like like the little girl who has the ice cream drops and starts crying But everyone's gone and they're marching and the ice cream man is in his ice cream truck and

234
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:13,670
Speaker 1: he starts to take off his tie.

235
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,222
Speaker 1: But then he puts it back on like oh, oh shit.

236
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:19,637
Speaker 0: like he sees himself taking off the time He freaks out like what am I doing?

237
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:28,610
Speaker 0: And then they're getting closer and he's trying to hide he's covering his ears He tries to climb into the freezer and then they start doing the countdown one naked man.

238
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:39,961
Speaker 0: And then it gets to nine naked men and meanwhile a new naked man is running forth and then he sings ten naked men And he has joined them and is marching off toward awesome.

239
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:40,423
Speaker 1: Yep.

240
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,030
Speaker 1: Go ice cream, man.

241
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:56,550
Speaker 0: so then it cuts back to the people inside and the father is stripping himself completely naked and Desperately trying to get outside and the family is physically restraining him and yelling and screaming and then finally like he loses it He's like, oh it happened again and he's crying.

242
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,557
Speaker 0: Yeah the naked man leave and they're gone.

243
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:05,610
Speaker 0: and as their song fades away it cuts back to the father and he's like And his family's like yes, dear he's like.

244
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,957
Speaker 0: And then the credits roll, yep, well the credits are before that.

245
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:12,580
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but it fades to black.

246
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:13,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, it fades to black.

247
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:16,266
Speaker 1: now This video is just as odd.

248
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:20,860
Speaker 1: remember that I had a thing of the day where some dad beat up some punk kids skateboarding.

249
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:25,419
Speaker 1: This is the opposite of that because it shows what society should be.

250
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,268
Speaker 0: I mean this first of all, there are so many.

251
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,171
Speaker 0: this is like utenna.

252
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,479
Speaker 0: There are so many ways to interpret it now.

253
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:35,294
Speaker 1: First I think we're definitely reading more into it than the creator did.

254
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:35,957
Speaker 1: but that's okay.

255
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:36,559
Speaker 0: I don't know.

256
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:37,426
Speaker 0: I wonder.

257
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,240
Speaker 0: I'd like to I'd like to talk to the people who made it.

258
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:48,040
Speaker 0: But anyway, first off if you take it at face value It is nine naked men marching down the road causing a heap of trouble for all concern, which is awesome.

259
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,649
Speaker 0: It's absolutely hilarious.

260
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,662
Speaker 0: The comedic timing is impeccable Mm-hmm.

261
00:20:53,244 --> 00:21:02,015
Speaker 0: Now if you look at it from one metaphorical perspective those men represent that Libertine freedom that is so lacking in American society.

262
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,000
Speaker 1: They are the awesome.

263
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:11,454
Speaker 0: These are men who have decided that you know fuck all with Convention and all of your you know, rabble rabble rabble crap.

264
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:12,418
Speaker 0: I am naked.

265
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:15,559
Speaker 0: I'm proud I'm marching down the street and it is my right to do so.

266
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:20,140
Speaker 0: I beg all of you to join us in our revelry and our libertine wanton fun.

267
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:35,680
Speaker 1: And it also shows you that all you know, the men in society, I guess but you know The people of the world want to join them secretly, but because you know, they have this bullshit suburban life You know, they're withheld and they you know, they're concealed and they're holding in their inhibitions.

268
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:46,720
Speaker 0: I mean the ice-cream man clearly wants to join them but he is so repulsed by the idea of joining them that he becomes very Conflicted and the only time he becomes happy is when he realizes that that's what he really wants.

269
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,543
Speaker 0: so he goes and does it.

270
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:53,880
Speaker 0: meanwhile the father who think of this like a a fundamentalist group that is against homosexuals.

271
00:21:54,743 --> 00:22:14,430
Speaker 0: many times the rationale is that Homosexuality is something that is that can easily get you they can convert you they can make you be that way and it seems to me that the only people who would think that are people who are Homosexual and do want to be that way and think that everyone else feels that way And that it's you know a seductive thing.

272
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:15,837
Speaker 0: and it's the same thing.

273
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:16,320
Speaker 0: the father.

274
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:23,900
Speaker 0: He obviously really wants to do it and his family forces him not to and he ends up being one of them self-hatin.

275
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:26,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like, oh they almost got me.

276
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:28,864
Speaker 0: it's so sad Oh my god.

277
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:33,040
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the only time in the whole video he actually looks inspired is when he wants to join them.

278
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, the rest of the time he's all.

279
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:38,220
Speaker 1: he's either crying or he's just kind of bored and useless.

280
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:52,039
Speaker 0: Also the fact that society will use peer pressure as in, you know, everyone's saying no, this is horrible run away But it will also use coercion if it can to oppress you meaning they physically prevented him from joining the naked men.

281
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:06,860
Speaker 1: Yep Let it just be said that you know Rim and Scott are on the side of the naked men and if there were naked men marching down the road They would be plus two most likely except that they would probably then become registered sex offenders.

282
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:14,638
Speaker 0: Now, of course the third way to look at this that I just remembered that we were going to talk about We kind of skip is that these people are doing something.

283
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:23,505
Speaker 0: Not really, but you know if these were real people doing something really and not for a film they're doing it something that we like to call Freaking squares.

284
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:25,754
Speaker 1: Yes, you might remember the Simpsons episode.

285
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:27,140
Speaker 1: I believe it was the one with the Tamako.

286
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:29,247
Speaker 0: No, it was completely different.

287
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:30,611
Speaker 1: Those are with Ben and Jerry.

288
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,240
Speaker 1: Yes, and because that also involved a farm.

289
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,123
Speaker 1: That's why anyway

290
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:51,978
Speaker 0: Homer and the hippies decided to go freak some squares meaning go out Find people who are living their mundane life and do something that they can't just automatically react to kind of like what those Living theater people who do like Invader Best Buy or be slow-motion for 10 minutes in a Home Depot do?

291
00:23:52,259 --> 00:24:00,908
Speaker 0: yep Where you suddenly do something that people just can't deal with or it's something that people can't just rationalize Automatically and they have to stop and think.

292
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:08,821
Speaker 0: and your hope is that when they stop and think they might realize That they're kind of living their life like an automaton Mm-hmm.

293
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:20,700
Speaker 0: I mean I I do it occasionally where little things like if I'm standing in an elevator and everyone's facing the door I just kind of turn around and face all the people and it's amazing how absolutely uncomfortable everyone else in that elevator gets immediately.

294
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:22,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's always a fun one.

295
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:26,258
Speaker 0: or I'll just make eye contact with someone and not break it and they don't know what to do.

296
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:29,452
Speaker 0: Really people just don't know what to do.

297
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:39,852
Speaker 0: if I'm walking down the street And I'm like like I'm working in a lab somewhere and I just look up at someone to make eye contact and don't say anything They immediately look away like he saw me.

298
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:43,319
Speaker 1: Oh No, I'm not invisible anymore.

299
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:45,383
Speaker 1: What do I do?

300
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,468
Speaker 1: Oh, he has true sight.

301
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:49,313
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm so screwed.

302
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,398
Speaker 1: I can make a visual joke.

303
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:57,993
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Scott made an incredibly hilarious joke, but there's no way I can possibly impart over the air.

304
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:58,976
Speaker 0: Haha.

305
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,360
Speaker 1: It is so inside.

306
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:02,866
Speaker 1: It's inside our house still.

307
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:03,950
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

308
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,191
Speaker 0: Yes.

309
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,339
Speaker 0: I made another inside joke that no one can see.

310
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:13,480
Speaker 0: If anyone remembers this episode the next time they see us in person ask us about the inside jokes and see if we remember.

311
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:17,347
Speaker 1: haha Okay, I have a thing of the day.

312
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:20,180
Speaker 0: Why bother my thing of the day was so unbeatable.

313
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:21,705
Speaker 1: It's an okay thing of the day man.

314
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:22,127
Speaker 0: Is it?

315
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:25,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's a prison and a guy breaks out.

316
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:33,780
Speaker 1: I don't know how he broke out But he did and I guess he either did it by awesome skills or by stupidity the guards and hopefully it was awesome skills.

317
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:41,338
Speaker 1: I'm guessing it's awesome skills because of what he does in the video You see this guy's that break broken out of prison running down some train tracks.

318
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:47,480
Speaker 0: now Meanwhile, all the police know that a man who looks like this gentleman has just broken out of prison in this area.

319
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:50,652
Speaker 1: So of course running down the train tracks, who does he come across?

320
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,740
Speaker 1: but a police officer?

321
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:05,519
Speaker 1: Now, of course He doesn't just get up and run because well the cop would get in his car run Chase after him in the car hit him with the car Get out cuff him and put him in the back of the car.

322
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:13,049
Speaker 0: Also, probably call for the helicopter and the guards and say and the dogs and these the dogs and the bees the dogs That you bees out of the other car.

323
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,120
Speaker 1: That's a little while down the tracks and yeah.

324
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,300
Speaker 1: So he stops and talks to the police officer.

325
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,762
Speaker 1: He's got like a power rate or a Gatorade or something and you know, he's not wearing prison garb I think he's.

326
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:26,836
Speaker 1: he changed his clothes and whatever and the cop is like man.

327
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:27,860
Speaker 1: this guy fits his description.

328
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,680
Speaker 1: So he keeps a radioing, you know for help, but the cops picture of the guy isn't the highest quality.

329
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:42,207
Speaker 1: so he's not a hundred percent sure and The cop really questions the guy out and the guy isn't the brightest guy Like you could you?

330
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:55,248
Speaker 1: it's possible to have been much more smooth But his level of smoothness is sufficient to outwit this police officer and the cop just lets him go even with his Incredibly shitty alibi.

331
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,020
Speaker 0: now Scott and I view this slightly differently.

332
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:01,653
Speaker 0: I say that while he I mean, I don't know what the man did.

333
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,640
Speaker 0: so I'll assume that he murders babies.

334
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:07,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have no idea what the guy didn't seem like that evil a guy.

335
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:08,499
Speaker 1: He seemed like a normal kind of.

336
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,980
Speaker 1: He probably wasn't a killer.

337
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:12,851
Speaker 0: Yeah Let's assume he was a baby murderer just for the sake of argument.

338
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:14,477
Speaker 0: that way we're arguing the most extreme case.

339
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:16,851
Speaker 0: that way no matter What it's less bad than we think.

340
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,879
Speaker 0: okay, so The cop let him go.

341
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:28,220
Speaker 0: I would rather the cop let the baby murderer escape his custody Then have arrested someone who just happened to be walking down those train tracks.

342
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:29,199
Speaker 1: I gotta agree with that.

343
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:36,860
Speaker 1: But I do have to say if you watch the video all I'm saying is the cop does a real shitty job of checking to See if this is the guy I mean.

344
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:49,102
Speaker 1: You know the odds is someone coming along who meets the description so well And then you accepting the shittiest crap alibi like yeah, I'm in a hotel I don't even know where the hotel is my brother You know.

345
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:54,800
Speaker 1: drop me off some miles down the track so I could go jogging to the hotel and yeah.

346
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:58,315
Speaker 1: But then again I didn't even know the names of the towns around here.

347
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:01,882
Speaker 0: the guy's story follows the pattern of See.

348
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:05,280
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give you guys a little hint today because it really goes into what our main bit is.

349
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:16,806
Speaker 0: But if you want to lie to someone like a police officer or an authority figure one of the biggest keys you can do is to have a Somewhat strange story.

350
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:20,219
Speaker 0: don't ever say something generic like I'm just out for a walk.

351
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:26,300
Speaker 1: Or I think this guy says his name is like you know George Rogers or something so generic.

352
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:28,569
Speaker 1: Robert Robert Jones is what he says.

353
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:28,870
Speaker 1: his name.

354
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:35,414
Speaker 0: when I was caught by the police as a child doing things I shouldn't have been doing I always gave my name is like Steve something hmm.

355
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:36,879
Speaker 0: I just always use the name Steve.

356
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:50,075
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you need to lie to a police officer about something now of course I'm not advocating legally that you lie to a police officer who is doing his pursuant duties In a way that would get you in trouble.

357
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,988
Speaker 0: however That is simply the thing that I must say.

358
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:55,557
Speaker 1: isn't there not actually a law that says you you can't?

359
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,799
Speaker 1: there's no law that says You're not allowed to lie to a police officer?

360
00:28:58,061 --> 00:29:01,880
Speaker 1: No, just a law that says anything you can or say will be held against you if you're arrested.

361
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:04,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can lie to police officers all you want.

362
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:07,614
Speaker 1: Yeah if a police officer comes up and asked you and says do you know how fast you were going?

363
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:10,227
Speaker 1: and you know you can say I have no idea.

364
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,320
Speaker 1: or you can say I was going two miles an hour officer.

365
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:13,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can say whatever you want.

366
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:16,279
Speaker 1: Let's say you can say monkey purple Thursday.

367
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:25,572
Speaker 0: Unless he happens Unless he happens to have a judge with him and they put you under oath right away Yeah, then then you you can't lie, but there's no.

368
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:27,440
Speaker 0: or or if he's judged dread.

369
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,269
Speaker 1: Yes if it's judged don't lie to judge dread.

370
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,280
Speaker 1: or if it's a lensman cuz a lensman will know and He'll just get the truth out of your brain.

371
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:44,320
Speaker 0: But the point is Oh and Wonder Woman make your story a little bit off But not make it a little weird, but don't give too many details, but give at least one strange detail.

372
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:48,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, this guy goes beyond one strange detail into.

373
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,300
Speaker 1: basically he's obviously making it up on the fly.

374
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,249
Speaker 1: Like if you showed me this video without telling me it was the guy who was running he was escaping prison I would have figured out in about five seconds.

375
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,700
Speaker 1: I've been like, oh, that's the guy cuz he's just making up shit.

376
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably doesn't know what.

377
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:03,774
Speaker 1: he doesn't know where he is.

378
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:04,580
Speaker 1: He doesn't know anything.

379
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,947
Speaker 0: Well, just remember there's a you have to make up.

380
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:20,490
Speaker 0: I'd say a good baseline if you're panicking is make up three Details as to what you were doing and don't give any more details because if you give more than three or four details When a cop asks you that's a sign of nervousness.

381
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:23,642
Speaker 0: and the moment you're showing that kind of nervousness The cop is going.

382
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:27,100
Speaker 1: is the thing is the guy it was acting kind of nervous and the cop did kind of suspect.

383
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:27,983
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no the cut.

384
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:32,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cop didn't obviously know what I'm telling everyone.

385
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:36,060
Speaker 0: You I mean you can get away with lying to people who are dumb.

386
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,460
Speaker 0: I think I had no idea how to lie to people who are somewhat smarter than this cop.

387
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:43,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, give three pertinent details.

388
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:49,480
Speaker 0: Make sure at least one of them is somewhat strange and make sure your story is not just run-of-the-mill.

389
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:55,845
Speaker 0: but don't make it like don't say a bear killed me and Now I'm on these train tracks.

390
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:58,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point of this video is look at the stupid cop.

391
00:30:58,555 --> 00:30:59,157
Speaker 0: Hahahaha.

392
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:04,233
Speaker 0: Anyway, our topic today is how to not suck at talking.

393
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:04,795
Speaker 1: No.

394
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,520
Speaker 1: Wow, that's kind of generic.

395
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:13,929
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is we originally were going to do a show on how to do a good panel and we realized that Doing a good panel is one specific topic.

396
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:25,904
Speaker 0: but public speaking in general and the presentation of you know Your voice and your speech and your person Really could do to be an entirely separate show because a panel discussion would also have to talk a lot about the content Which I don't want to bother with today.

397
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:29,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it depends what kind of panel you're doing.

398
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,924
Speaker 1: But anyway Public speaking.

399
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:37,097
Speaker 0: Yes, public speaking is something that the majority of Americans cannot do well and are afraid of.

400
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:45,500
Speaker 0: in fact, and There are many studies that show that more Americans are afraid of public speaking than they are of dying.

401
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:51,304
Speaker 1: Now here is my first piece of advice to anyone who is Nervous at all.

402
00:31:51,364 --> 00:32:01,671
Speaker 1: if you have any amount of nervousness in your body when you get up to talk to more than one person Like you're standing on a stage or anything on a podium What the hell are you afraid of?

403
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,679
Speaker 1: what the fuck's wrong with you?

404
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,682
Speaker 1: I mean, what do you think?

405
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:08,020
Speaker 1: They're gonna throw tomatoes at you, but they're all gonna boo you and you got to run away.

406
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,601
Speaker 1: They're gonna.

407
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,546
Speaker 0: music's bad and you should fail that.

408
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:23,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like even if even if you're absolutely terrible you give the worst presentation Imaginable of whatever you're doing and everyone in the audience hates you and they think you're the worst person ever You know, they treat you like a baby raper.

409
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,954
Speaker 1: What's the worst they can do?

410
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:25,295
Speaker 1: What?

411
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:31,525
Speaker 1: you're not gonna go to jail You're not gonna get killed, you know, you're not gonna be anally raped You're not gonna.

412
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,638
Speaker 1: nothing bad is going to happen now.

413
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:39,200
Speaker 0: granted That sounds like very easy to follow advice that for many people is actually very very difficult to follow.

414
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:42,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I just I can't understand it because I never had the problem.

415
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:43,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

416
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,889
Speaker 0: Anyway, I at least understand that it's not you.

417
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,623
Speaker 0: just because someone's afraid of something and you tell them that it's not something to be Afraid of.

418
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:51,951
Speaker 0: that doesn't make it any easy.

419
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:53,300
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't say it does make it easy.

420
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,540
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I don't understand where the fear comes from because I don't have it.

421
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:05,760
Speaker 0: most people Scott who are actually human beings and not some kind of masturbation bod Know that they are afraid.

422
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,462
Speaker 1: I just don't know.

423
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:12,840
Speaker 0: most humans have an innate fear of being embarrassed of being discredited of being ridiculed.

424
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:14,819
Speaker 0: Many people have low self-esteem.

425
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,023
Speaker 1: Well don't have those things.

426
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,976
Speaker 0: many people are speaking for a grade where something bad can happen to you.

427
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:24,421
Speaker 0: a grade is not important It can be not really now, uh, yeah It can be.

428
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:30,480
Speaker 0: once Scott if I had a GPA of less than 3.4 IBM by their policy would not have even looked at my resume.

429
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not such a big deal.

430
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is terms of your greater life.

431
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:35,220
Speaker 0: You know what?

432
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:42,598
Speaker 0: it kind of is because working for IBM is pretty much what made me the Badass that I am today in terms of being able to get a job wherever I want.

433
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:49,660
Speaker 0: Hey working for IBM has greatly affected my life as much as many other of the greatly pivotal events in my life.

434
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not like if you didn't work for IBM you would have worked somewhere shit.

435
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:58,480
Speaker 0: Also, if I had not had a 3.4 GBA I would have lost all of my scholarships.

436
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:01,352
Speaker 0: Thus I could not have afforded to go our go to our IT.

437
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:01,794
Speaker 0: Thus.

438
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,260
Speaker 0: I would have had to immediately drop out.

439
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would have still made it somehow.

440
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,132
Speaker 0: No, I probably wouldn't have.

441
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:11,618
Speaker 1: I couldn't have generated that much money and I certainly You would have gone somewhere else, you know done something else.

442
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:14,679
Speaker 0: Yes My life would have been completely different, but it would have been bad.

443
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:17,414
Speaker 0: The point is that a grade can affect your life.

444
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:22,250
Speaker 0: or for example Say you're giving us a big presentation to a client for a company.

445
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:27,989
Speaker 0: if you botch the presentation and the client doesn't buy and it's a Big account you're there's a good chance.

446
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:28,893
Speaker 0: You might just be fired.

447
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,339
Speaker 1: that that is possible.

448
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,005
Speaker 0: Yes So yes, don't say that there can't be consequences.

449
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:39,659
Speaker 1: because there can be I guess but I've never had to give a speech or presentation with severe consequences.

450
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:47,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it's the best kind to give because if you suck at public speaking don't go giving speeches With consequences.

451
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,659
Speaker 1: do the non consequence ones first to build the skills.

452
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:56,580
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I mean, honestly, I have a lot more experience with this partly because I you know I was I was on the eboard of the anime club.

453
00:34:56,721 --> 00:35:05,388
Speaker 0: So every week for much of my college existence I had to get up in front of a few hundred people or a couple hundred people and you know Generally keep their attention not get laughed at talk about things.

454
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,242
Speaker 0: I Do it.

455
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:15,400
Speaker 0: I'm starting to suspect that not many places actually force people to do this much anymore.

456
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:24,205
Speaker 0: But at RIT pretty much any class you took you generally had to give at least one somewhat significant Presentation to the class.

457
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:25,870
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah in some of my classes.

458
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,495
Speaker 1: I had to give presentations weekly.

459
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:33,755
Speaker 1: Yes for computer classes I'd have to get up and talk about the project I was working on every week and give status reports and all sorts of things.

460
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:37,480
Speaker 0: one seminar I took on political speech giving a political communication.

461
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:49,340
Speaker 0: Not only did we have to present something every class but every week for every other week a Student was responsible for teaching to the entire class an entire lesson.

462
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:55,619
Speaker 1: I love that because a as I love teaching the class and because I think I do a better job than some teachers.

463
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,456
Speaker 1: and Be that take that teachers awesome and lazy so they get points.

464
00:35:59,476 --> 00:35:59,758
Speaker 1: Yes.

465
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,259
Speaker 0: Yes That was one of my favorite classes ever.

466
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:07,800
Speaker 0: Yeah Even though we I mean it was 12 people and we were all pretty smart and the teacher knows a lot about political science.

467
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:13,780
Speaker 0: He was convinced Absolutely convinced that John Kerry was not going to get the Democratic nomination.

468
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:18,338
Speaker 1: He shows you how much of a science political science is.

469
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:30,640
Speaker 0: Anyway now addition, I actually took every Communications class that RIT had to offer because I had free time in my schedule and I really liked that major.

470
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:32,840
Speaker 0: But I realized I could never get a job with that major.

471
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:40,782
Speaker 0: so I took a Concentration in it and I used that as an excuse to be able to sign up for all the classes that I normally couldn't sign Up for.

472
00:36:41,304 --> 00:36:45,600
Speaker 0: and what I did is I never filled out the paperwork to complete the concentration.

473
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:49,800
Speaker 0: Thus I was always in it and I could keep taking the classes long after I'd fulfilled the requirements.

474
00:36:50,981 --> 00:37:00,240
Speaker 0: Mmm, good move which was a big deal at RIT because class those classes build up almost immediately And if you didn't get in early in the crazy registration system, they have you could never take these classes.

475
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when I went to the liberal arts department.

476
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:04,800
Speaker 1: They're like you took too many liberal arts classes.

477
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,448
Speaker 1: I'm like, uh, it's fine.

478
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:07,915
Speaker 1: Just fill all these other slots with them.

479
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:08,398
Speaker 1: I don't care.

480
00:37:08,418 --> 00:37:10,643
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

481
00:37:10,783 --> 00:37:15,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also took a class specifically on public speaking and speech giving.

482
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:24,658
Speaker 1: I took the best speech public presentation class that I ever had was actually in my senior year of high school because there was this really good teacher.

483
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:51,840
Speaker 1: basically what He did is the whole class was come up with a speech and give it to the class and do it over and over and over and over and over and By the end of that class pretty much everyone was awesome like I even had a friend in that class who was just so nervous to go and talk in front of even like two people and He would get up in front of the class and start giving these great speeches and halfway through he just be like I can't go On and then he'd sit down even though he was giving this great speech and no one thought bad of it.

484
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:53,291
Speaker 1: That's how good the teacher was.

485
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:53,714
Speaker 1: Wow.

486
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,841
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright.

487
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,028
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's I learned.

488
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:10,620
Speaker 0: actually I remember because I'll say that I used to when I was very young Despite how you know loud I tend to be nowadays when I was very young I was actually very nervous about speaking in public or speaking in front of a crowd.

489
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,920
Speaker 1: So I guess in first grade they made me the narrator for the little pigs play.

490
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:23,162
Speaker 1: Oh I always hated that but for completely different reason and I would cuz I was loud and I was the only person who could speak Loudly and clearly I Read.

491
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:44,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what bothered me the most about school when I was very early schools that whenever the class would read something as a Whole I would read the whole thing like ten minutes while the class took an hour because apparently everyone else in the room couldn't read at All and they couldn't actually Say what they were.

492
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:52,845
Speaker 0: so that's for sure host to say Yeah, it just it bothered me and I'd always get in trouble because the teacher would call on me like I ran And you got to read something.

493
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,233
Speaker 0: I'd be like what I was asleep.

494
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:54,797
Speaker 0: I was done.

495
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:55,340
Speaker 0: I already read it.

496
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:57,270
Speaker 1: I always seem to get stuck with the narrating job.

497
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,160
Speaker 1: I remember middle school with Odyssey of the Mind.

498
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:07,947
Speaker 1: I got stuck with being the narrator with you know My loud and concise speaking but at least when I'm reading something when I'm coming up with stuff in my head It's not so good.

499
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:17,942
Speaker 0: in seventh grade suddenly our English teacher decided that we had to learn how to speak in public and what she did is she had everyone write down a Topic.

500
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:19,690
Speaker 0: Well, she didn't say what was going on.

501
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,859
Speaker 0: She just said write down a topic you're interested in.

502
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:23,167
Speaker 0: So we all wrote something down.

503
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,013
Speaker 0: Of course.

504
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,268
Speaker 0: I was the nerd who asked the question Can it be anything?

505
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:27,698
Speaker 0: and she said yes, it can be anything.

506
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,930
Speaker 1: However, did you write down?

507
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:30,997
Speaker 0: We'll get to that.

508
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:31,400
Speaker 1: Okay.

509
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,726
Speaker 1: So then I like how this is.

510
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:36,960
Speaker 1: now geek fables of public speaking instead of how to not suck.

511
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:38,511
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll give a bunch of advice real quick.

512
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:39,640
Speaker 0: Okay the end anyway.

513
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:53,012
Speaker 0: So then she puts them all in a hat and she says alright starting now with in alphabetical order Everyone is going to draw something from this hat and give a two-minute speech on it to the whole class and the whole room goes Oh shits

514
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:58,594
Speaker 1: What if it was something you didn't know like someone else wrote down like car racing.

515
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:00,020
Speaker 1: you didn't know shit about cars exactly.

516
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,735
Speaker 0: It was a test of extemporaneous speaking skill.

517
00:40:03,077 --> 00:40:05,247
Speaker 1: Oh, wow Yeah, it's pretty good.

518
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:06,411
Speaker 1: That'd be good for college.

519
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:09,503
Speaker 0: So the first person goes up and they get something I don't remember whatever.

520
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:11,449
Speaker 0: the second person goes up.

521
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,115
Speaker 0: They pull something out of the head.

522
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:14,600
Speaker 0: They look straight at me.

523
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:17,047
Speaker 0: They say Brandon, I hate you.

524
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:21,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they say I don't know anything about Norse mythology.

525
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:36,965
Speaker 0: Awesome, I remember that mine was flowers and I was really nervous and I got up and I start babbling Flowers.

526
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:39,239
Speaker 1: flowers blah like a gibbering mouth thing.

527
00:40:39,581 --> 00:41:08,091
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said the word for flower in German because someone had said that to me not two days earlier Uh-huh, and I finished and I realized right then and there that the class reacted to me The exact same way that they'd reacted to the people who'd gone before me and then as I watched To the same way to everyone that went after and with one exception or someone who gave a really funny speech No one was treated any differently by the audience at all And in fact, no one cared one shit except

528
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:08,593
Speaker 1: for nerdy.

529
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,080
Speaker 1: McFinkster who got picked on.

530
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:13,030
Speaker 0: Actually, no, no one can't like no one in the audience cared.

531
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:13,673
Speaker 1: Maybe nerdy.

532
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:15,140
Speaker 1: McFinkster was in the class across the hall.

533
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:19,459
Speaker 0: Oh, no no one in the audience cared at all how good anyone's speech was.

534
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:26,005
Speaker 0: and After the class was over and it ended I realized then that I can just give a speech and it doesn't matter cuz no one Cares.

535
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:27,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much So.

536
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:36,460
Speaker 0: then we had to actually give speeches in class like we had to prepare two speeches an informative one And I forget that a persuasive one something like that doesn't really matter.

537
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,306
Speaker 0: No, I did my my.

538
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,757
Speaker 0: I did my one that effectively was persuasive on Dungeons and Dragons.

539
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:42,740
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

540
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:46,920
Speaker 0: and Actually, I'm very proud of my other speech my informative one.

541
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:51,200
Speaker 0: I did a spoof of John Cleese's how to irritate people.

542
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:58,018
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and I talked for an hour about for 45 minutes about how to irritate people and it was hilarious Uh-huh.

543
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:09,680
Speaker 0: So I guess the first bit of advice to actually tie this into the advice is Remember that no matter how afraid you are in most cases like Scott was saying until I completely are disagreed with him.

544
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,944
Speaker 0: But it is true in many cases.

545
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:12,990
Speaker 0: The audience doesn't give a shit.

546
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:16,887
Speaker 1: No, I mean most likely they're just gonna go to sleep And they don't care.

547
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:18,219
Speaker 1: I mean depending on where it is.

548
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:31,720
Speaker 1: I mean if it's a panel at an anime con they want to be entertained and informed Yeah, but if it's like a business thing you want to convince someone but most of the time In all the situations I can think of its people are there because they have to be or something like that.

549
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:35,429
Speaker 0: Let me put it this way If you don't like public speaking you probably avoid it.

550
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:40,631
Speaker 0: as a result if you are in a situation where you are public speaking Meaning it is mandatory.

551
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:42,080
Speaker 0: You did not elect to do it.

552
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,555
Speaker 0: You have been chosen to do it by some force.

553
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:45,360
Speaker 0: You have no control over.

554
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:46,581
Speaker 0: Odds.

555
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:51,719
Speaker 0: are the people who have to listen to you don't care any more than you do and aren't any more interested than you are?

556
00:42:52,703 --> 00:43:02,459
Speaker 1: And also though if you are forced into a mandatory situation where there might be Consequences if you've been avoiding it all this long time you're out of practice and you're going to screw it up.

557
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:09,418
Speaker 1: So if there are ever opportunities to speak in public with no consequences just take them because no one will care.

558
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:14,595
Speaker 1: now I mean you will improve your skills at something which is not easy to improve your skills at.

559
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:16,342
Speaker 0: I can at this time give a Nod to.

560
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:20,160
Speaker 0: I mean there are a lot of organizations out there for people who are afraid of public speaking.

561
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,809
Speaker 0: Really the most prominent one is the Toastmasters.

562
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:25,760
Speaker 1: Oh, do they just give toast you just go there and keep toast.

563
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:31,925
Speaker 0: See, I thought it would be cool and I joined at IBM and I realized it was kind of lame because for me at least But for a lot of people really helps them.

564
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:33,611
Speaker 0: the Toastmasters are clubs.

565
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:36,200
Speaker 0: They have annual dues, but they're trivial.

566
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,160
Speaker 0: It's some piddly amount of money like a dollar.

567
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:40,479
Speaker 0: It's like 60 or something bucks, but it's not much.

568
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:46,618
Speaker 0: That's and you can go to their meetings for free pretty much Okay, and all they do is they give speeches to each other and then critique each other.

569
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:54,380
Speaker 0: Usually every group or Chapter has one or two experienced speakers and then a bunch of people who want to get better and it's usually a very good thing.

570
00:43:54,682 --> 00:44:01,336
Speaker 0: I personally found it very cheesy and boring but After I did one speech at IBM, the guy said why are you even here?

571
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:02,159
Speaker 0: You want to run this?

572
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,824
Speaker 0: Yes, and I never went back.

573
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:08,465
Speaker 1: See I would go to it not to improve my speeching skills But I would go to.

574
00:44:08,886 --> 00:44:11,779
Speaker 1: you know, give many persuasive speeches to the group of people there.

575
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:14,453
Speaker 1: Yeah to convince them of things that they were.

576
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:15,820
Speaker 0: here's why the Toastmasters suck.

577
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,946
Speaker 1: Here's why Toastmasters suck.

578
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:19,332
Speaker 1: Here's why God doesn't exist.

579
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:21,380
Speaker 1: Here's why Linux is the best.

580
00:44:22,811 --> 00:44:32,520
Speaker 0: Yeah So anyway, the fear thing we can't really cover anymore Other than the best way to get over your fear is to realize no one cares and to do public speaking whenever you can.

581
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:39,091
Speaker 1: Yeah there are other things you can do about it that a lot of people suggest like look at one person in the audience and just Concentrate on them.

582
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:46,908
Speaker 1: or you know Imagine a chicken dancing in the back of the room or get your friend to wear a chicken suit dance in the back of the Room and all that kind of BS, but that's just.

583
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,340
Speaker 1: you know ways of getting around the problem without pulling it out by the roots.

584
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:54,212
Speaker 0: Yes Actually, I remember the advice that I gave to a friend in high school.

585
00:44:54,473 --> 00:45:00,900
Speaker 0: that was stupid and hilarious And I wish there was a funny follow-up story, but there isn't though pretend there is one pretend.

586
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,140
Speaker 0: I told a funny story that happened as a result of this because none actually happened.

587
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:16,344
Speaker 0: I'm not going to make something up, but I Had a friend in high school who's very afraid of public speaking and my and he was like he was a guy and my advice was Think about Naked women.

588
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:20,703
Speaker 1: Oh my god, because I knew a guy who said he did this But I didn't believe him.

589
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:29,220
Speaker 1: is that when he was gonna give a speech you would bring up his speech notes and a plate and A center a playboy centerfold and he would put it one next to the other to give the speech.

590
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:30,440
Speaker 1: See do okay now.

591
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:35,119
Speaker 0: I told him you know just think about that stuff and it'll take your mind off of how afraid you are.

592
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:39,817
Speaker 0: Now my intention was that he would have a giant erection during his speech in class, which didn't happen.

593
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,988
Speaker 0: Yeah You know what?

594
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:43,340
Speaker 0: yeah, it happened.

595
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,697
Speaker 0: He had a giant erection in class and everyone laughed at him.

596
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:48,959
Speaker 1: good thing He wasn't a naked man walking down the road and then he died of cancer.

597
00:45:52,242 --> 00:46:00,819
Speaker 0: Now in terms of actually being good at public speaking or in terms of you know Speaking to a group of people no matter how large it is is that there are a bunch of very simple tricks.

598
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,645
Speaker 0: one Don't make.

599
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:18,040
Speaker 0: I will make eye contact with the audience But if you are uncomfortable doing so or and actually if you have the trouble I have where if I make eye contact with someone it tends to either unearth them when I'm giving a speech or I lock on To them and then it's obvious that I'm staring at someone.

600
00:46:18,165 --> 00:46:29,845
Speaker 0: Yeah the idea is look at everyone's foreheads and kind of look through everyone with a thousand mile stare because then Every single person in the audience thinks that you're making eye contact with them when in fact You're not making eye contact with anyone.

601
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:33,577
Speaker 1: You gotta be like the Abe Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial.

602
00:46:33,617 --> 00:46:34,560
Speaker 1: He's not looking at anyone.

603
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,760
Speaker 1: He's just got these eyes that are kind of going out over the whole area there.

604
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,579
Speaker 1: But if you look at the statue, it looks like it's looking at you.

605
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:43,507
Speaker 0: So that's the first see.

606
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:46,960
Speaker 0: we're gonna give very specific advice as opposed to the generic a blah blah blah.

607
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:51,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta have your eyes not looking down not looking up at the ceiling.

608
00:46:51,601 --> 00:47:00,259
Speaker 1: You gotta have them looking straight out, but not you know, if you're on a stage or if you're elevated at all I mean if the people are sitting and you're standing your head is above them.

609
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:08,269
Speaker 1: so if you're in order to look people in the face and in the eyes your head is going to have to be pointed down a Little bit or your eyes are gonna have to be pointed down.

610
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:13,300
Speaker 1: if you keep your head straight and your eyes Straightforward you won't be looking at anybody.

611
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:20,732
Speaker 1: You'll probably looking at like the back of the room or the chairs in the back or people's hair But everyone will think you're looking at them which is now.

612
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:22,840
Speaker 0: that was the effectively beginners advice.

613
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:29,440
Speaker 0: Yes, the advanced advice is that you really don't want to ever make eye contact with anyone in the room.

614
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:34,075
Speaker 0: However, what you do want to do is it depends on what kind of speech you're giving.

615
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:44,805
Speaker 0: but my general advice if you want to Appear confident and strong and you're trying to persuade the audience of something the best Mode your head can be in is you want to be looking Downward slightly.

616
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:50,749
Speaker 0: your head should be angled down just a little bit like you're looking at the ground But your eyes should be angled up.

617
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:54,060
Speaker 0: So you're kind of looking at everyone through slightly lowered gaze.

618
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:56,953
Speaker 0: So you're looking up like past your eyebrows at everyone.

619
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:58,863
Speaker 0: now don't do it Obviously.

620
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:06,253
Speaker 0: this has to be subtle but that sort of body posture Puts forth an extremely strong almost predatory.

621
00:48:06,313 --> 00:48:33,460
Speaker 0: Look that will keep the audience's attention very well Mmm, then doubt that is not so useful in front of very very large crowds But it is incredibly useful if you were talking to a small group of people Yeah and if you even if you're talking one-on-one using that kind of body language at the and then Increasing it slightly just as you make your important point Will very easily bowl over people who aren't ready for it or who are easily persuaded

622
00:48:34,141 --> 00:48:34,643
Speaker 1: Regardless

623
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:35,247
Speaker 0: of what you're saying.

624
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:46,374
Speaker 1: that also reminds me if there's a camera of some sort Like let's say you're on TV and as a video camera There's usually like a light or a thing that you're supposed to look at that, you know You know how Jon Stewart's always looking right into the camera.

625
00:48:46,394 --> 00:48:47,420
Speaker 1: That's what you got to do.

626
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,436
Speaker 1: You got to find where the thing you're supposed to look at is and look right into it or else You know the camera is gonna look at it like the side of your head.

627
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:56,012
Speaker 0: That's not good Though you still in a camera situation.

628
00:48:56,052 --> 00:49:03,560
Speaker 0: You still want to Basically pan your head from left to right and back and forth very slowly and somewhat erratically while you talk.

629
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:05,432
Speaker 0: So it looks like you're engaging a large crowd.

630
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:06,640
Speaker 1: You don't want to look like a statue.

631
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:07,957
Speaker 1: You want to look like, you know.

632
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:12,475
Speaker 0: More importantly if you were trying to impress people or do a good speech.

633
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:22,160
Speaker 0: if you're looking straight at the camera It doesn't matter to the people in the audience so much but to the people watching on TV It looks as though you are only speaking to the camera and that you have no audience at all.

634
00:49:22,582 --> 00:49:30,759
Speaker 0: If you're looking to the sides a lot the audience Subconsciously at home will get the impression that there's an incredibly large crowd there.

635
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:38,115
Speaker 0: It's just kind of a subconscious thing that you can use to your advantage Especially to make it look like you're giving a much more important speech than you really are.

636
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:38,958
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

637
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:44,774
Speaker 0: Now in terms of voice you have got to be loud or have a microphone.

638
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,020
Speaker 0: There are no bones about that.

639
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,087
Speaker 0: There's no way around that.

640
00:49:48,147 --> 00:49:49,980
Speaker 1: preferably be loud with a microphone.

641
00:49:50,522 --> 00:49:58,660
Speaker 0: If you are a quiet person and you have a quiet voice or if your voice is damaged or if there's some reason you can't Talk loudly you must get a microphone.

642
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:04,920
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm not going to talk about microphone etiquette and microphone technique because that would be an entire other episode.

643
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:09,174
Speaker 0: Yeah suffice to say if you're holding the microphone don't fiddle with it.

644
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:10,920
Speaker 0: Don't hold it in front of your face.

645
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:11,804
Speaker 0: Hold it down.

646
00:50:12,205 --> 00:50:14,274
Speaker 0: Scott holds it in front of his face.

647
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:17,738
Speaker 1: That's where I'm holding it now and Be consistent with it.

648
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:20,148
Speaker 0: However, you decide to hold it right or wrong.

649
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:29,627
Speaker 1: don't change that unless someone who is directing you tells you to yeah But what it all comes down to is that if no one can hear what you're saying it doesn't matter what you say.

650
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:33,959
Speaker 1: nothing else matters because no one can hear you and That's that's bad.

651
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:46,587
Speaker 0: Now in order to give a good speech or to talk to people in an engaging way You really the best way to do it is to speak extemporaneously Meaning don't have notes don't ever prepared speech just talk.

652
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:51,850
Speaker 0: say whatever you think you should say, which is Incredibly difficult if you haven't done it before.

653
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,020
Speaker 1: well, I mean, you know, we're do it on this show.

654
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:55,720
Speaker 1: We don't have any prepared anything.

655
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,580
Speaker 1: We just talk the way we would talk in public to our friends or to anyone on the street.

656
00:50:59,941 --> 00:51:07,440
Speaker 0: See the thing is people have a lot of trouble doing that to a crowd and more importantly usually You are speaking about something that isn't colloquial.

657
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:14,392
Speaker 0: I mean if I was giving a speech and act like I was political speech or something I probably wouldn't be talking the way I'm talking now.

658
00:51:14,895 --> 00:51:19,783
Speaker 0: No, probably not and but basically the Speaking as temper.

659
00:51:19,824 --> 00:51:20,646
Speaker 0: extemporaneously.

660
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:31,180
Speaker 0: the best way to do it is if you're speaking about something you were knowledgeable about the more you know About the topic at hand the easier it will be for you to give a speech with less preparation.

661
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean well first of all, it is very important to prepare.

662
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:35,820
Speaker 0: Well, yeah to a point.

663
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,360
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean don't over prepare we'll get into that.

664
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,437
Speaker 0: But in terms of actually giving the speech if you know about the topic The more you know the less you have to prepare.

665
00:51:44,457 --> 00:51:44,780
Speaker 0: think of it.

666
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:55,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, for example, if Stephen Hawking was gonna give a speech on some sort of astrophysics thing He already knows he doesn't have to go and study it or write up a bunch of notes He just get up there and start talking about it.

667
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:04,340
Speaker 1: If you ask me about like to give a speech on You know doing a geek nights podcast or Linux or anything I know a lot about I can just get up and tell you everything I know about it.

668
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:06,036
Speaker 1: It comes right out the mouth.

669
00:52:06,399 --> 00:52:22,199
Speaker 0: now the other thing is Even if you know like say you're the quiz bowl master and you memorize all the facts about Greek mythology That doesn't mean you'll be able to give a good speech on Greek mythology because unless you know the subject Intuitively as opposed to knowing the facts of the subject.

670
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:31,695
Speaker 0: While you'll be able to give perfectly accurate information and this seems to be the problem a lot of informative speakers seem to have Yeah, you PowerPoint people, you know all your stuff.

671
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:32,540
Speaker 0: You know it.

672
00:52:33,265 --> 00:52:43,727
Speaker 0: You have the knowledge you were imparting the knowledge But because you don't truly understand the content you don't emphasize the proper things and you over emphasize The things that don't matter so much.

673
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:50,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're essentially just a talking in monotone encyclopedia a lot of the time Which no one wants to hear because they could just read the encyclopedia.

674
00:52:51,219 --> 00:53:00,820
Speaker 0: now Along these lines a lot of people can't speak Extemporaneously for various reasons and because it is a difficult thing to do and there are many times when I have not been able To do it and I've been forced to prepare.

675
00:53:01,623 --> 00:53:08,527
Speaker 0: When you prepare a speech very simply don't write the whole thing Unless you plan to memorize it.

676
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:14,185
Speaker 0: if you write the entire speech out word for word and then you try to read it You will completely fuck up.

677
00:53:14,627 --> 00:53:15,971
Speaker 0: or you will look terrible.

678
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,319
Speaker 1: or you have a teleprompter and you know how to use it.

679
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,205
Speaker 0: Yes, however rare case.

680
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:24,360
Speaker 0: However, if you have never used a teleprompter, it is not easy.

681
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,068
Speaker 1: No, it is not good.

682
00:53:26,209 --> 00:53:28,640
Speaker 1: You have to spend a lot of time learning how to use one of those freaking.

683
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:36,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you're talking to it because we had one in one of our classes and you look away at the audience and you look Back you lose trip play track where you are and you're completely fucked.

684
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:41,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's sort of a. if you're the president talking on TV That's when it's for.

685
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:42,859
Speaker 1: it's not for anything else.

686
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:48,453
Speaker 0: But if you if you're gonna write a speech out you would better memorize it.

687
00:53:48,814 --> 00:53:49,817
Speaker 0: and by memorize it.

688
00:53:49,937 --> 00:53:56,353
Speaker 0: I don't mean memorize it I mean Say it often in front of mirrors for weeks before you're giving your speech.

689
00:53:56,574 --> 00:54:02,662
Speaker 1: Yeah when we're talking about preparation, you know I wasn't talking about you know, you write down every single word you're gonna say I'm talking about.

690
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:07,980
Speaker 1: you give the speech over and over again to yourself to your friends to anyone else in the house.

691
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,220
Speaker 1: But you know the more important the speech the more you want to practice it and you see what they think of it.

692
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:20,077
Speaker 1: and you know if they seem impressed like You know or you do it to the mirror and it seems right and you don't sound like an idiot then you know You're doing good.

693
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:25,660
Speaker 1: You know if you can't even give the speech to like your mom your dad and your friend sitting in the room you're in trouble.

694
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:32,200
Speaker 0: Yes, don't think that you'll magically pull one for the team or suddenly bust out amazingly.

695
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:35,624
Speaker 1: No, if anything you'll suddenly crumple, you know Hey, it's.

696
00:54:35,664 --> 00:54:41,732
Speaker 1: but even there's a chance that even if you did it successfully for you know your friends and your family that you'll screw up the best happy medium.

697
00:54:41,832 --> 00:55:12,100
Speaker 0: if you know a topic but you don't know it intuitively Or if you think you're a good enough public speaker to where you'll be able to just blow through it the best way I've found to prepare is to make you know little note cards or a sheet of paper that have a Basic outline of the order you want to talk about things in and the key points you want to talk about and Then have like a line or a piece of something or a bit or a statistic or all the things you want to remember For sure to say like say you have a really awesome line or a quote you want to use in the middle of a section.

698
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:16,300
Speaker 0: Put that down verbatim so you don't forget it, but don't put anything else down verbatim.

699
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:18,926
Speaker 1: That's what I would do In when I had to write speeches.

700
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:26,340
Speaker 1: for that class is I would write a speech and then it would go through and for every Paragraph I would delete the entire paragraph from the from the word processor.

701
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:29,374
Speaker 1: But I would write like a phrase that you know.

702
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:30,660
Speaker 1: get the idea of the paragraph.

703
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:55,012
Speaker 1: So if I wrote a paragraph about you know the memory manager I would just write talk about the memory manager or I just write memory manager and if those is Statistic or a particular piece of information in that paragraph that I'd remember a number I would put that one with an indent and I would just do that for every single paragraph and in the end I had one measly index card with the topic of each paragraph and Maybe a fact for some of those paragraphs.

704
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:56,178
Speaker 1: and that's what I would go in with.

705
00:55:56,379 --> 00:55:59,780
Speaker 1: you know And I just knew you know I looked down whenever I was stuck.

706
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:08,219
Speaker 1: You know whenever I was about to run out of things to say I'd look down at the next word and I would Transition right into that and just say everything I knew about the next thing.

707
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,640
Speaker 0: All right, we've gone a little long.

708
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:16,420
Speaker 0: I imagine we'll talk about this many times in the future with more and more details since there's a lot more we could say.

709
00:56:17,603 --> 00:56:27,807
Speaker 0: One last piece of advice because I think this is the most important piece that you can have when you're speaking publicly and that is You know there's the voice coming out of your mouth And then there's the voice in your head.

710
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:30,559
Speaker 0: the voice that's there that when you think to yourself you hear it in your head.

711
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:36,543
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm when you were speaking to not the voices in your head that are like telling you to kill people Not that one.

712
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:37,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are the fire voices.

713
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,509
Speaker 0: those are separate.

714
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:39,051
Speaker 1: those are bad.

715
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:51,251
Speaker 0: now when you were speaking to a crowd You really need to somehow find a way to make the voice that is in your head be perfectly in sync With the voice that is coming out of your mouth.

716
00:56:51,513 --> 00:57:02,120
Speaker 0: don't be thinking Independently of what you were saying because then you will forget what you were saying and if anything disturbs What is coming out of your mouth you will completely lose track of what you're doing?

717
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll go uh like I do on the podcast all the time.

718
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:09,500
Speaker 0: Oh, so instead of thinking you basically you want your thoughts to be your word.

719
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:15,900
Speaker 0: So everything that you were thinking is what you were saying and you have to concentrate to do this now.

720
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,120
Speaker 0: the Concentration will keep you on topic and prevent you from straying.

721
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:34,260
Speaker 0: It'll also prevent you from getting distracted in your head because many times it has happened to me where I'm speaking At a thing where I'm not really prepared at all like say it's a geek nights episode But I didn't really read the news article I'm talking about and I'm tired or I'm I'm fiddling with something on my desk.

722
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,348
Speaker 0: I'm not actually I'm fiddling right now.

723
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:38,155
Speaker 1: You are fiddling I see that fiddle.

724
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:43,560
Speaker 0: now at that point my mind Wanders, so I'm thinking this little figure of kagali is really cute.

725
00:57:43,722 --> 00:57:56,568
Speaker 0: I wonder if I can unscrew this thing but my mouth is still talking and Then suddenly my mouth a little buffer in my mouth runs out of things to say and my mind is still thinking And suddenly I have nothing to say.

726
00:57:56,628 --> 00:58:04,159
Speaker 1: it generally happens to me when rim talks for a while And then I start thinking about something else besides rim saying and then it's my turn to say something that go what.

727
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,646
Speaker 1: oh Shit I had to say something.

728
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:13,413
Speaker 0: so I hope there are at least some useful nuggets in that long Ramblings somewhat disorganized talk about talking G.

729
00:58:13,454 --> 00:58:17,344
Speaker 1: We just did we did a bad example And it's supposed to be.

730
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:17,705
Speaker 1: well.

731
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:20,394
Speaker 0: see the thing is while geek nights is often informative.

732
00:58:20,674 --> 00:58:24,488
Speaker 0: our primary goals are Insightful and more often funny.

733
00:58:24,508 --> 00:58:25,693
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

734
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:27,240
Speaker 1: I don't know if funny is the goal.

735
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:28,551
Speaker 1: I think it's more of a side effect.

736
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:32,080
Speaker 0: funny is my goal But then again, the goal of my life is mostly funny.

737
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:38,340
Speaker 1: Okay, my goal life is to have funny to view and hear funny things, you know making funny things just sort of happens.

738
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:47,099
Speaker 0: So if anything in the forums ask us questions about public speaking and I I'm sure we can give you Very detailed pieces of advice.
