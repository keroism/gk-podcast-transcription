1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,724
Speaker 0: Warning!

2
00:00:00,945 --> 00:00:03,820
Speaker 0: What you are about to hear is not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,980
Speaker 0: In fact, it is probably as far from a normal episode of Geek Nights as you'll ever hear.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,580
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we could just go "pfft" and that would be it.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,640
Speaker 1: And that would be as far from an episode of normal Geek Nights as you would hear.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,540
Speaker 0: Well, I guess there was the last year on the Thursday before Otacon the show we put up.

7
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,520
Speaker 1: Oh shit, we have to make a show for that Thursday.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,140
Speaker 0: No we don't, I'm thinking we shouldn't do anything.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,284
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

10
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,760
Speaker 0: We're talking in the wrong tense because that already happened.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,119
Speaker 1: It did already happen, yes.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,939
Speaker 1: This is Tuesday, July... 24th today.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,587
Speaker 0: Wow, it's a week from now.

14
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:36,019
Speaker 0: We're in the future podcasting back to you.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,763
Speaker 0: That's kind of cool.

16
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:41,340
Speaker 0: Actually, no, we're in the past podcasting to you in the future.

17
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:42,520
Speaker 1: Even better.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,844
Speaker 0: And then in the future, I guess we're... You know what?

19
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,631
Speaker 0: It's complicated.

20
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:47,560
Speaker 0: There's a paradox there.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:57,680
Speaker 0: Suffice to say, if you are a new listener, and I know a lot of you are, from all the things we did at Otacon, all the things we did at Kineticon, this is not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

22
00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,220
Speaker 0: This is what's called the Geek Nights Special.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,420
Speaker 0: Special is a code word for Raymond Scott or out of town, dead, or too lazy to do a real show.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,139
Speaker 1: I guess we could be dead, but yeah.

25
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,960
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that on Thursday.

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,729
Speaker 0: You should...

27
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:16,900
Speaker 1: You should listen to a normal episode of Geek Nights before you judge whether you want to listen to our show or not.

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,700
Speaker 1: I don't care if you listen or not, but just don't judge us by this throwaway episode effectively.

29
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:23,625
Speaker 0: I care a little bit.

30
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,799
Speaker 0: I'm kind of Mega Love maniacal.

31
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:26,637
Speaker 1: Yeah.

32
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:28,660
Speaker 0: I like people to listen to my voice.

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,360
Speaker 1: I like people to listen, but you know, I just don't want them to judge based on the wrong thing.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,940
Speaker 0: That is definitely true, because I'll tell the story, I think, also on Thursday about that.

35
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:39,962
Speaker 1: Yeah.

36
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:44,040
Speaker 1: So, today we're just going to talk for a few minutes about a random video game.

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,860
Speaker 1: Rym picked the game.

38
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,582
Speaker 0: Yeah.

39
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,880
Speaker 0: Basically, we kept saying games until one of us picked a game that we both agreed on.

40
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:51,340
Speaker 0: And the idea was, it's not a game that we could review.

41
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,978
Speaker 0: We could do a whole show on it.

42
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:56,600
Speaker 0: And at the same time, it bears talking about, and we needed something.

43
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,100
Speaker 0: So, we're going to do a Geek Nights Flash.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,599
Speaker 0: It's like under a special, even.

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,580
Speaker 0: Tonight, we're going to review Burger Time for the Intellivision and the Nintendo and a million other systems.

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:06,961
Speaker 1: Yeah.

47
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,318
Speaker 1: So, Burger Time is about this cook.

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,379
Speaker 1: And the cook, I guess he wants to make burgers.

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,280
Speaker 0: This cook, the chef, lives in a world of giants.

50
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:21,160
Speaker 0: So, he has to make giant burgers for giants to eat, but he's tiny and wears a French chef hat.

51
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:25,140
Speaker 1: And he's being attacked by evil things, evil food ingredients.

52
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,240
Speaker 0: The pickles and the French fries and that egg.

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,966
Speaker 0: That fucking egg.

54
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,159
Speaker 0: I hate that egg so much.

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,661
Speaker 1: Yep.

56
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:31,933
Speaker 1: And his only weapon is salt.

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,120
Speaker 0: Or pepper, depending on the version of the game.

58
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,060
Speaker 1: But salt pretty much ruins all the bad guys.

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,560
Speaker 1: He just shakes that salt on them and they dry right up.

60
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, for like 10 seconds and then they're fine again.

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:47,000
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there's water everywhere from the moist, steamy burgers.

63
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:53,999
Speaker 0: I just got to say, in terms of old games like that, this is one of the few games that really stood out as being awesome, even back then.

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Speaker 1: It was, you know, I think what it was is back then, so many games were just unplayable.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,179
Speaker 1: And this is a playable game that worked.

66
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,259
Speaker 1: So, it already was like way above everything else.

67
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:08,300
Speaker 1: And not only that, but in addition to being playable and working, it was fun.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,318
Speaker 1: Until Donkey Kong, you know, this was pretty much it.

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,101
Speaker 0: Plus, I remember as a kid, and this got interesting, that I never owned an Intellivision or an Intellivision 2.

70
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:18,820
Speaker 0: But my grandma on my mom's side did.

71
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,580
Speaker 0: And I'd always be excited when I went to her house, because she had the Intellivision.

72
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,578
Speaker 0: I only had the Atari.

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
Speaker 0: And the Intellivision, whether you guys liked it or not, a lot of people haven't played it.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,576
Speaker 0: Or they tried to play that GameCube crap version that just doesn't work at all, that I paid $1.99 for.

75
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:34,946
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Speaker 0: The actual Intellivision worked really well.

77
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:39,378
Speaker 1: It worked okay.

78
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,408
Speaker 0: It worked really well.

79
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,299
Speaker 0: Have you ever used one?

80
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, a couple times.

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,685
Speaker 0: What, an Intellivision or an Intellivision 2?

82
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:45,016
Speaker 1: I don't know.

83
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,320
Speaker 0: Alright, well, I'll review the Intellivision someday.

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,620
Speaker 0: But suffice to say, my grandma was real freakin' good at BurgerTime.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,559
Speaker 0: She was better than me for as long as I played against her.

86
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:56,698
Speaker 1: Awesome.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,020
Speaker 0: And basically, you'd walk along the burgers, and you could track the guys in the burgers.

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Speaker 0: And there was rudimentary AI as the things would try to chase you around.

89
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,880
Speaker 0: And it always felt like the egg was smarter than everyone else.

90
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,300
Speaker 0: The egg was always the one who headed me off at the pass.

91
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,765
Speaker 1: I think it just happened to be.

92
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:15,500
Speaker 1: the placement of the egg was always in the annoying spot.

93
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:21,079
Speaker 1: You know, the other guys were off to the side, or you could take some ladders and go around them and still get your burger together.

94
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,100
Speaker 1: But the egg was always right there, like on the burger, or right in your way.

95
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,800
Speaker 1: There was no other way to go, and that's why the egg sucked.

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,220
Speaker 0: The other thing I just really remember about it was there was this kind of this exploration aspect.

97
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,240
Speaker 0: Because as you got further into the game, different ingredients would start appearing.

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,447
Speaker 0: And I'd always be like, "Whoa!

99
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,353
Speaker 0: Check that thing out!

100
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:38,957
Speaker 0: I'd never seen that

101
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:39,299
Speaker 0: before.".

102
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the hell is that?

103
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause there's only so many things to put on a burger.

104
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,559
Speaker 1: You don't know, it might be a bad guy, it might be a new power-up.

105
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,099
Speaker 1: You know, of course there weren't any new power-ups.

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,869
Speaker 0: No, they were all just ingredients.

107
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,740
Speaker 0: It was pretty obvious what they were.

108
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,999
Speaker 1: I know, but you know, sometimes you never know.

109
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:57,880
Speaker 1: The thing is, I could- Especially in the- I mean, in some of the versions where the graphics are better, there was no question what they were.

110
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:04,560
Speaker 1: But in some of the worst graphic versions, if you hadn't played a better version, you know, so you see something new, you might not know what it is.

111
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,978
Speaker 0: Well, pretty much it was like, "Alright, that's obviously the bun, 'cause it's on the

112
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:08,300
Speaker 0: bottom.".

113
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,559
Speaker 1: The bun is always obvious.

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,840
Speaker 0: But there's the red thing and the green thing, and then the brown thing, and then there's the whitish thing, and you don't know what that is, maybe it's an onion, but they're all just squares.

115
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:18,394
Speaker 1: Yep.

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Speaker 0: Or rectangles.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,860
Speaker 1: Yep, and you step on them and they fall down and they land on the burger, and eventually you put the top on that baby and you get some points.

118
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,660
Speaker 0: And I think that's the end of that, because frankly, at this moment, we are probably either watching a movie or playing a game in a beach house in Wildwood.

119
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're a punk kid and you've never played BurgerTime, or if you're an old person who remembers BurgerTime, you haven't played it in a while, just go play some BurgerTime, 'cause it's still okay.

120
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:46,280
Speaker 1: And eat a burger.
