1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,865
Speaker 1: It's Thursday March 25th 2021.

2
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:19,359
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight We were talking about solitaire puzzles and puzzle books and such like.

3
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:21,433
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,559
Speaker 1: so uh try to make plans for this weekend and tomorrow and the nice weather.

5
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:38,426
Speaker 1: and Scott I ran to a little bit of an impasse cuz I went to one website and it said it's gonna be like 79 degrees tomorrow and Case I would cancel work.

6
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:43,680
Speaker 1: and Scott went to a website that gave a like 15 to 20 degree lower estimate.

7
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:45,326
Speaker 0: We try that much lower.

8
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:46,651
Speaker 0: It was more like 10 degree lower.

9
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,860
Speaker 1: 10 degrees is still a significant difference.

10
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:50,625
Speaker 0: It is very significant degrees.

11
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:57,007
Speaker 1: Fahrenheit is like a seasonal difference like that's why I act and dress very differently If it's 60 versus 70 or 70.

12
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:12,369
Speaker 0: for yeah I mean the point is is that the weather of the coming next coming few days in this geographic area is Probably going to be at its coldest like at the night time like high 40s and High 50s on the forecast.

13
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:18,878
Speaker 0: I'm looking at right now and at the best part of the day It might be like low 70s at best right probably high 60s.

14
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,374
Speaker 0: So for a lot of people that's plenty good weather for going outside.

15
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:23,695
Speaker 0: for me.

16
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:24,860
Speaker 0: That's still a little cold.

17
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,440
Speaker 1: How did you get so old so fast?

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,668
Speaker 0: It's a little bit cold.

19
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:38,620
Speaker 1: I can't just go with no jacket shorts and If it's low 60s mid 60s if it's above 45 I can run in shorts and like a thin long sleeve shirt for hours.

20
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:43,410
Speaker 1: If it's above 60 I can just bike like shorts t-shirt, let's go.

21
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,055
Speaker 0: No, it's too cold.

22
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:52,626
Speaker 1: how Well anyway, uh Now, I don't know like.

23
00:01:52,726 --> 00:02:01,420
Speaker 1: it'll be really interesting to see because we went to three different weather websites and got three significantly different weather forecasts for like tomorrow and Saturday.

24
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:07,460
Speaker 0: One of them you said had the wind warning tonight and another the National Weather Service at the wind warning tomorrow night.

25
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,091
Speaker 0: Yeah, so check to make sure you weren't reading.

33
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,660
Speaker 0: I don't know what weather calm you're looking at.

34
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:37,149
Speaker 1: Streaming it.

35
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,138
Speaker 1: I said it to Queens.

00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:40,604
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, 48 78 interesting.

37
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:40,744
Speaker 0: Yeah.

00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:45,823
Speaker 1: No No, yeah All right.

39
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:46,627
Speaker 1: We'll see how this go.

40
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:48,740
Speaker 0: whether that gov does not agree with weather.com.

41
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:55,040
Speaker 1: No, which is which is fascinating, but no the gale warning is apparently from tomorrow morning until Saturday morning.

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,223
Speaker 1: All right.

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,045
Speaker 0: Well biking and gale is not great.

44
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:03,520
Speaker 1: Southwest wins 20 to 30 knots with gusts up to 40 for what the fuck?

45
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:09,680
Speaker 0: Now what I learned from a man that I met in a chance encounter while biking many years ago in the city.

46
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,740
Speaker 0: Is that as if it's not raining?

47
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,738
Speaker 0: That would be an excellent time to get your box.

48
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:14,980
Speaker 0: kite.

49
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:21,272
Speaker 1: Kite flying is something I have not done since I was.

50
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:21,774
Speaker 1: what was the like?

51
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:23,280
Speaker 1: we tried to fly a kite at RIT once.

52
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,359
Speaker 0: That's one of those things that could be a great Thursday geek night's episode if we knew anything the fuck about it.

53
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:29,369
Speaker 1: I know a little bit.

54
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,380
Speaker 1: I used to fly kites a lot.

55
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:38,482
Speaker 1: You don't know enough to talk about 30 minutes like a fucking expert Even if I can if I share every anecdote I have because some things happen with kites the anecdote I have.

56
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:41,192
Speaker 0: I've tried to fly kites like cheapo kites occasionally.

57
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,460
Speaker 0: Obviously those aren't gonna make my own kites.

58
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:44,550
Speaker 1: I had a collection of kites.

59
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,499
Speaker 1: I'd fly them all the time.

60
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,719
Speaker 1: I tried to get into that kite battling but it's actually not fun at all.

61
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:52,171
Speaker 0: And then I met at that dude one time and that was my kite.

62
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,060
Speaker 1: Was it the dude who's always on the east side bike path?

63
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,446
Speaker 0: No, because there's a dude.

64
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,980
Speaker 0: There's this dude who works at the the Queen Science Museum.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,844
Speaker 0: I don't know if he's still there.

66
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,532
Speaker 1: I've seen this dude for like a decade.

67
00:04:03,673 --> 00:04:08,620
Speaker 1: whenever I do my half marathons I always run like up the east side path and I come down like over Randall's.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,951
Speaker 1: I like I have all this route.

69
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:17,536
Speaker 1: I do every time and There's one spot where if it's windy at all the same dude has been there for like a decade.

70
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:24,015
Speaker 1: fly in a gigantic box kite So far in the distance that it's like weird.

71
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,500
Speaker 0: That's how you know the pros.

72
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:27,050
Speaker 0: The kite is so far away.

73
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,660
Speaker 0: You think yeah helicopter a plane is.

74
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:33,487
Speaker 1: I've never seen him launch it.

75
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:36,841
Speaker 1: cuz he appears to start flying these kites like.

76
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:46,154
Speaker 0: I did actually meet one guy in that area one time on on one of the The bridges the pedestrian bridges that goes over the FDR.

77
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,560
Speaker 0: He was on the staircase.

78
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:51,017
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's the same guy, but I did meet a guy in that area one time.

79
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:54,512
Speaker 0: Yeah He didn't hand me his kite, but he let.

80
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:54,774
Speaker 0: he was.

81
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,820
Speaker 0: he's like feel the string.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,412
Speaker 0: The string was tight like it felt like someone was yanking on the other end.

83
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:01,459
Speaker 1: feel the string was something that like.

84
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,611
Speaker 1: That was how I learned to fly kites.

85
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:04,900
Speaker 1: my dad when he was teaching me as a kid.

86
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,820
Speaker 1: I remember he would like not hand me the kite because a little kid just I think was afraid I just lose it or something.

87
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,558
Speaker 1: But he was like touch the string see how it stops.

88
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,660
Speaker 1: you know It's pulling and that's how he kind of taught me like he made me put my hand on his string.

89
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:17,730
Speaker 0: Getting into that situation.

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,808
Speaker 0: you know once you once it's there, it's like okay You're just holding this thing right.

91
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:24,599
Speaker 0: you can let out string or bring in string But you know getting it well.

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,949
Speaker 1: There's a novice with some basic lessons.

93
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:36,513
Speaker 1: if you have enough room to get a running start against the wind You can get a kite going pretty easily if you don't have like the east side path the reason I'm so fascinated with this dude.

94
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,199
Speaker 1: He's got to be a pro.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,320
Speaker 1: Starting a kite especially a box kite from a standstill without like a running start.

96
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:46,926
Speaker 1: I could never fucking did it in my life Like I could never pull it up.

97
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,923
Speaker 0: bet if we search for this on YouTube we can just find we'll find videos of people like Doing it right.

98
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:51,687
Speaker 1: there's technique.

99
00:05:51,728 --> 00:06:00,940
Speaker 1: the internet will tell us everything kind of like how way back I had that thing in the day that was like remember the pine bog the The pine box Derby like that that's bit, and how it's been ruined by the internet.

100
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how on the internet you can just look up the exact perfect car.

101
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:03,800
Speaker 1: everyone.

102
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:07,317
Speaker 0: Just instead just like net decking and magic people just net carring.

103
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:11,220
Speaker 1: yep As a kid I tried to make my thing is good.

104
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:16,680
Speaker 0: Even as a kid there was someone who they didn't net car cuz there was no net at the time.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,227
Speaker 1: But like they had a parents who like knew they had.

106
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:28,420
Speaker 0: they knew someone who knew like the best design and because they had that Information from somebody right I remember the Cub Scouts.

107
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:39,176
Speaker 1: Well, I won the like our dens tournament like with the six of us in the den, and then I was like oh fuck I get to go compete now for real with like the actual like the whole pack, and I show

108
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:39,437
Speaker 0: up

109
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,840
Speaker 1: and There I saw that almost every other car was identical.

110
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:52,100
Speaker 1: They were all identical to each other with different colors exactly was way different and mine was like half the speed of theirs.

111
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:54,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to say I cried.

112
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:55,234
Speaker 1: This was a long time ago.

113
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:58,691
Speaker 0: I didn't cry I was I was salty cool.

114
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,078
Speaker 1: I was real salty.

115
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,646
Speaker 0: I Thought my car was the coolest looking But actually you know it was.

116
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,056

Speaker 1: those robot decals felt so good to put on.

119
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:14,819
Speaker 0: I rubbed on pretty much every decal.

120
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,735
Speaker 1: yep I got a decals like I wrote that fire on the side fire on the top.

121
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:22,673
Speaker 1: I put all the extra ones I didn't have anywhere to put on the bottom.

122
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:23,400
Speaker 1: Just cuz I wanted to you.

123
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:29,459
Speaker 1: I thought it was cool But I put a little metal man like with a helmet like in the top of it.

Speaker 1: Anyway, so uh yeah uh in the news.

Speaker 1: at no point Do we say the word chair we keep talking about.

Speaker 0: Yes, it's the such a geek night's thing.

151
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:51,157
Speaker 1: But anyway you I'm not like you can read how this happened, it's amazing.

152
00:08:51,177 --> 00:09:02,091
Speaker 1: this hasn't happened before like yeah, and Frankly if you're like me This is the kind of like Wikipedia rabbit hole that could occupy you for weeks.

153
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:06,603
Speaker 1: the the Suez Canal is a fascinating Topic.

154
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,427
Speaker 1: like seriously.

155
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,090
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding.

156
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,400
Speaker 1: go read the Wikipedia article about the Suez Canal.

157
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,633
Speaker 1: There is so much going on about that thing.

158
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,400
Speaker 1: you think a Panama Canal is important?

159
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:18,419
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the Suez Canal.

160
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:32,440
Speaker 1: But the the other cool thing about this that you can learn is the sheer number of people whose sole Profession is continue is making the Suez Canal function.

161
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:38,638
Speaker 1: That is like an army of humans working every single day 24/7 to make that thing work.

162
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:42,966
Speaker 1: like Ships catches go into it They like form convoys.

163
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:49,625
Speaker 1: only like a hundred and sixty ships go through it a day like there's there is like how it works How they organize these ships.

164
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:55,959
Speaker 1: like there's a class of ship called a Suez max because it is literally the maximum size that can fit in the Suez Canal.

165
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:07,279
Speaker 1: It's super cool, but the article I'm gonna link to It actually talks about like what's the impact of this boat being stuck in this canal with that tiny little digger slowly working?

166
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:07,820
Speaker 1: enormous?

167
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:17,639
Speaker 1: enormous impacts 400 million dollars in economic damage alone an hour Every hour.

168
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,033
Speaker 1: 400 million u.s.

169
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:22,637
Speaker 1: Dollars of economic activity is being lost.

170
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,460
Speaker 1: and that's gonna see includes.

171
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:30,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this count this includes things like something isn't getting to his destination on time.

172
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,380
Speaker 0: therefore something else, right?

173
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,335
Speaker 0: It's includes things like something on a boat is spoilable and it's spoiled.

174
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it includes things.

175
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,851
Speaker 0: Oh, it includes things like there is a suppose has to go a boat has to go around now Or we has to go around.

176
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,502
Speaker 0: some boats are waiting more Waiting.

177
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:49,988
Speaker 0: is I waiting or going around?

178
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,053
Speaker 0: doesn't matter that boat.

179
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,800
Speaker 0: Your is money is being lost.

180
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,496
Speaker 1: You can if you don't know where the Suez Canal is it connects the Red Sea in the Mediterranean Sea.

181
00:10:56,516 --> 00:11:02,400
Speaker 1: go look at Google Maps And figure out how to get a boat between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea if the Suez Canal is not there.

182
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:08,867
Speaker 1: But like that some of this damage is.

183
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:12,820
Speaker 1: there are goods that are part of a supply chain for other goods.

184
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,360
Speaker 1: So those other goods are not being blocked by this.

185
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,267
Speaker 1: But no one can make more of those.

186
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:22,809
Speaker 0: and then once the boat if the boat doesn't get to his destination to empty It doesn't get to fill with something else.

187
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,300
Speaker 0: It's the stuff waiting to go on a boat.

188
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,558
Speaker 0: Then the boat isn't showing up.

189
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,582
Speaker 0: You know an emptying.

190
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:40,820
Speaker 1: we're approaching the point where the impacts of this boat being stuck are going to last for years already literal years Mm-hmm and Like I learned some things.

191
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:46,940
Speaker 1: I think only like a hundred and seventy boats actually traverse a day because that's how much in each direction maybe total.

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know they did.

193
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,140
Speaker 0: obviously, you know for such an important thing.

194
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:56,076
Speaker 0: It's it brings up questions like you know, well, it was working fine all this time, right?

195
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,380
Speaker 1: So it's how come this never happened?

196
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,006
Speaker 0: Well, no, and what do we know about boats?

197
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:05,909
Speaker 0: Nothing canals nothing, but it's like you could have like invested into the canal Maybe widened it deepened it.

198
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:06,412
Speaker 0: they have.

199
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,840
Speaker 1: there have been significant investments.

200
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,479
Speaker 1: The Suez Canal is better than 25. as late recently as 2015 There was significant work to make this canal even better.

201
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:17,452
Speaker 1: The Panama Canal is also good proved and made large not good enough.

202
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:18,054
Speaker 0: Apparently.

203
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,000
Speaker 1: Well, cuz there's no such thing is good enough.

204
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:20,932
Speaker 1: It's induced demand.

205
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:33,849
Speaker 1: No such thing is good now, I guess That's true unless every boat that wants to go anywhere in the world can get there Without having to wait at all.

206
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:52,140
Speaker 1: There's there's a bottleneck But like one of the things that we're not even counting yet all these ships that are stuck Mean that new ships can't even be loaded because it's a cargo containers have not made it back to places like China.

207
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:53,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said that already.

208
00:12:53,625 --> 00:13:00,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like specifically the empty cargo containers are all bottled up now Just like being piled up like all over the u.s.

209
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:06,820
Speaker 1: This This is the it's interesting how a lot of news is get talked about a lot in pop culture around the world.

210
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:11,120
Speaker 1: But a news like this people are making fun of it and like it's the interesting situation.

211
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:23,900
Speaker 1: but very few people seem to really like be internalizing how Drastically this one ship having a accident in this one tiny place has impacted the world.

212
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,298
Speaker 0: Mmm, or at least you know the world of people who have money to buy goods.

213
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,884
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I mean there are people are not.

214
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,334
Speaker 0: you're not living in a capitalist kind of.

215
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:34,599
Speaker 0: you know a place with.

216
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:35,826
Speaker 0: you know That's involved in trade.

217
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,980
Speaker 0: if you know, then it probably won't affect you at all.

218
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:46,248
Speaker 0: Yep, there are still like weird ravification still that you know, but yeah majority of people on earth are affected but it will it.

219
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:55,878
Speaker 1: what it echoes is the one of the theories around the Bronze Age collapse Which is you know during the Bronze Age bronze was very important as you might.

220
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,100
Speaker 1: you don't say I don't say called it the Bronze Age like you don't say what was important about the Iron Age.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,502
Speaker 1: I don't know.

222
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:02,687
Speaker 1: What about the Stone Age?

223
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:03,731
Speaker 1: Why do we call it?

224
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the Stone Age?

225
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,627
Speaker 0: I don't think would have been.

226
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:13,179
Speaker 0: you know, I mean, it's like yes We only had the technology of stone in the Stone Age, but I don't think it would have been like.

227
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,610
Speaker 0: well It wouldn't because stone yes might yeah, it's like my.

228
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,720
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like my stone boat clogged up the canal on this.

229
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:33,460
Speaker 1: There was an era in the Bronze Age where there was a like large global trading network like Significant like massive trading network and a lot of complex societies all around the world and I'm talking like pre-grease.

230
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:44,159
Speaker 1: the problem was bronze requires a few different pieces of like a few different materials that in Vanishingly few circumstances actually exist in the same place.

231
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:50,180
Speaker 1: So an entire global trade network existed to make sure that everyone could make bronze because bronze was necessary.

232
00:14:51,121 --> 00:15:07,494
Speaker 1: When that when something disrupted that trade it basically destroyed civilization as most humans alive on earth at the time knew it Mmm, because the society was built on the foundation of that trade supporting the things that made that civilization function on a fundamental level.

233
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:11,098
Speaker 1: global shipping is very like that in the world today.

234
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:20,574
Speaker 1: if Another disaster happened like if the Panama Canal got blocked at the same time Like that could cause society to collapse maybe like we don't know humans.

235
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of.

236
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:25,229
Speaker 1: So just think about those things.

237
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,755
Speaker 0: people people losing their jobs, right?

238
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,103
Speaker 0: It's like well got to close the factory We don't have any materials to work with.

239
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:40,520
Speaker 1: Yep, or things like well can't make certain medical supplies anymore at all Because part A is made in China and part B is made in like Europe and part C is made in America.

240
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,669
Speaker 1: Well, there's no way to get those three parts together anymore.

241
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,400
Speaker 1: And none of those countries has a factory to make the other two parts.

242
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,465
Speaker 1: And oh just build a new factory.

243
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,852
Speaker 1: Yeah that that you know, what with what?

244
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:52,356
Speaker 0: with what materials?

245
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,699
Speaker 0: materials that come on a boat?

246
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:56,005
Speaker 1: There's a reason.

247
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:59,139
Speaker 1: there was a dark age between the Bronze Age and the next age.

248
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, it took a while to build stuff.

249
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:08,969
Speaker 1: But if you it's funny cuz the day this happened I was super busy at work like really busy.

250
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,336
Speaker 0: So really busy reading about the Bronze Age.

251
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:14,559
Speaker 1: I Was actually like I was in meetings like all day.

252
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:21,125
Speaker 1: So the day ends and I'm like fuck and I go to Twitter and I see this ship and I'm like, oh fuck Oh shit.

253
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:21,649
Speaker 1: Oh fuck.

254
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:23,020
Speaker 1: and I go into like discourse.

255
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,865
Speaker 1: I'm about to talk about it And I'm the only person who is like everyone else was like already following this like minute by minute And I just missed it for like.

256
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:37,519
Speaker 0: it is definitely a news that for some reason I saw people Finding out about it like so delayed.

257
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:38,744
Speaker 1: I'm still seeing.

258
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:42,740
Speaker 1: I saw somebody someone I work with found out about it today when I mentioned it.

259
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:43,542
Speaker 0: Right.

260
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:48,820
Speaker 0: So I think the reason is is that it's such a big news you that people can't help but share it.

261
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,459
Speaker 0: Right, a lot of people won't share all the news that they read.

262
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's such of news like this is very as a big shareable news.

263
00:16:55,933 --> 00:17:04,619
Speaker 0: So almost everyone has Retweeted it or you know posted it again in a you know saw it in one place and posted it in another.

264
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,650
Speaker 1: There's been like three evolutions.

265
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,839
Speaker 1: So the meaning of it, right?

266
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:16,638
Speaker 0: So you can sort of see because there's a higher percentage of people at least I think there's a higher percentage of people sharing this News when they discover it.

267
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:29,215
Speaker 0: I was able to see this delay of who's reading the internet every second of every day like me knowing it immediately and Who is finding out an hour later a day later, right and so on.

268
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:42,085
Speaker 0: you could see like people Discovering as time goes on and you can know now sort of infer their internet reading habits or their level of busyness From when they retweeted Or posted this.

269
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:44,273
Speaker 0: this that's an analysis.

270
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:49,700
Speaker 1: That would be interesting to study like Wow, like the right like how people react to news.

271
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:59,499
Speaker 1: I know there are people who are studying this kind of thing But I'd love to see those like a an impact map of like how the news spreads and how it reverberates And like that that sort of visualization and analysis.

272
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,665
Speaker 0: All right, let's go some other news.

273
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:05,900
Speaker 0: All right, so we had a thing of the day was the last week two weeks ago.

274
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:09,940
Speaker 0: Remember what is the anime cicadas, right?

275
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:23,040
Speaker 0: Everyone knows you watch an anime and it's Japan in the summer and they'll be Shots still shots of power lines with cicada noises to let you know that it's summer and it's about to be summer and the northern Hemisphere which means cicadas are coming, right?

276
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,220
Speaker 0: So, you know Japan will if you sure if you go to certain places in Japan You will hear those cicada noises if you're there at the right time in the right weather situation.

277
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,040
Speaker 0: But in the US we also have cicadas and I'm sure they're all around the world.

278
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:46,493
Speaker 0: In fact, I just learned a few minutes ago listening to a cicada podcast That was that was a few minutes long But right before I did this show cicadas have been around a hell of a long time.

279
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:52,520
Speaker 0: ancient peoples were writing about cicadas And so there are many different kinds of cicadas.

280
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:57,200
Speaker 0: They're obviously some that just come every year all the time, which is why you sort of hear them all the time.

281
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,800
Speaker 0: But then there's those ones that only come every so often, right?

282
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:10,457
Speaker 0: They go they're underground and then they all come out at once and then they go underground They breed the eggs or whatever or underground again and they come out again and like this cycle and the the.

283
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,432
Speaker 0: so we're the ones That are coming this year are the 17 year cicadas.

284
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,912
Speaker 0: So hopefully you will depending on your age if you're not like a hundred already.

285
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,299
Speaker 0: odds are you'll get to see them again.

286
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:28,316
Speaker 0: in 2038 we'll see them again, but it's the brood ex cicada.

287
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:29,219
Speaker 0: They're coming, right?

288
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:37,189
Speaker 0: And Obviously you have when you hear about this animal if you're a curious person You have a lot of freaking questions.

289
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,997
Speaker 0: How the heck do they know to come out every 17 years?

290
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,186
Speaker 0: What is the point of that?

291
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,515
Speaker 0: Why not just come out and breed every frickin year?

292
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:44,540
Speaker 1: Why are we talking of this?

293
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,503
Speaker 1: What do you mean bill?

294
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:46,245
Speaker 1: I didn't hate them.

295
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,453
Speaker 0: Why did they make these noises?

296
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:50,420
Speaker 0: Why are there so many of them, right?

297
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,606
Speaker 0: There's so many questions about this animal.

298
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:57,280
Speaker 0: What's up with the fungus that eats it from in the inside and makes its ass fall off?

299
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,420
Speaker 0: Yes, that's a real thing.

300
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,184
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:06,525
Speaker 0: So I had all those same questions some of those questions We actually don't.

302
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:08,071
Speaker 0: no one knows the answer to.

303
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:11,523
Speaker 0: we don't know why how they can tell That it's all.

304
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:16,260
Speaker 0: we don't know how they know that it's been 17 years and all signal to each other to come out together.

305
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,026
Speaker 0: We don't know that.

306
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,317
Speaker 0: we're trying to figure that out.

307
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,719
Speaker 0: But of course the most fascinating question is the one we don't fucking know.

308
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:32,565
Speaker 0: But every other question regarding cicadas can be answered by the podcast we're gonna link to and Maybe an article or two, who knows.

309
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:43,460
Speaker 0: but it's cicada time and it's cicada time is good news for people like me who rent And don't have to deal with any sort of like scraping cicadas off the lawn.

310
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:51,720
Speaker 1: And I deal with the fish flies like they're fish flies have a similar seasonal like every night every.

311
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,247
Speaker 1: I don't know the cycles or anything.

312
00:20:53,267 --> 00:21:03,120
Speaker 1: But every now and then a year would happen where there would be like Imagine it's just snowing dead bugs like a foot of dead bugs like that would happen in Connecticut.

313
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,742
Speaker 0: We had.

314
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:07,131
Speaker 0: basically there would be one day every year or few.

315
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:15,234
Speaker 0: I don't remember was every year or every few year, but our back porch Would just become 100% patio area 100% covered in flying.

316
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,140
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the flying is like forgot about that.

317
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:23,220
Speaker 0: It would be flying ant day and we try to you know, like get rid of as many flying ants as we could.

318
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:24,618
Speaker 0: But there was no stopping the fun.

319
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:27,991
Speaker 0: But so it'd be like oh, it's flying ant day.

320
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:32,087
Speaker 0: everyone get inside don't go on the back porch It's okay, get covered in flying ants.

321
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,274
Speaker 0: They didn't bite or anything, but it's like.

322
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:36,020
Speaker 0: who wants to be covered in flying ants?

323
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:40,076
Speaker 1: You know, there's someone out there who's like it's fucking my day.

324
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:42,406
Speaker 1: Here it comes For me.

325
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:46,820
Speaker 0: for me cicada time is awesome because I like cicada noises and I don't have to deal with the hassle.

326
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:52,000
Speaker 0: But some people who perhaps have lawns, especially it may be like a Virginia area, right?

327
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,963
Speaker 0: You're gonna.

328
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:59,052
Speaker 0: you know, depending on where it is the Brood X comes When they come for however many days it is.

329
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:01,040
Speaker 0: you're gonna be waiting through them.

330
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,380
Speaker 0: X might be coming and you're gonna be hearing and they're gonna be given a lot of noise.

331
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:08,303
Speaker 1: They're loud.

332
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:11,073
Speaker 0: If you there's too many of them and you know, they're big.

333
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:13,060
Speaker 0: they're like two inches big right and that's just one.

334
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,927
Speaker 0: And there's gonna be I think the in the podcast.

335
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:20,680
Speaker 0: they said in some places there could be millions of them per acre.

336
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:22,483
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

337
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't know what an acre is.

338
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:26,036
Speaker 1: Well, welcome to America.

339
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:26,779
Speaker 1: You can go look that up.

340
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:38,128
Speaker 1: It is weird when I think about like units of measure that I use I have a very clear idea of Exactly how big an acre is and it's a unit of measurement.

341
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:39,391
Speaker 1: I use that a regular basis.

342
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:42,800
Speaker 0: one acre is four thousand ish square meters.

343
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:49,770
Speaker 1: It's about the amount of like one relatively sustainable Farmstead for subsistence farming.

344
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,960
Speaker 0: It's like I think of it.

345
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,540
Speaker 0: I think of it is like a plot a plot of land.

346
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:55,303
Speaker 0: It's applies.

347
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:58,740
Speaker 0: what do you think about a standard plot of land like a front yard a house in a backyard?

348
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,940
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's an acre.

349
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,738
Speaker 1: Well, you know because you know I grew up in the suburbs.

350
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:05,048
Speaker 1: Suburbs are usually class like suburbs that aren't super dense.

351
00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,600
Speaker 1: people talk about like half acre and acre meaning how much land does each house have?

352
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,895
Speaker 1: Fancier like rich people suburbs that cause sprawl and problems.

353
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,120
Speaker 1: houses are on full acres.

354
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:18,511
Speaker 1: Usually they're on like a half acre and then dense suburbs.

355
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:21,140
Speaker 1: Like you just get the bare minimum the houses all crammed together.

356
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:31,706
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, and some other news New York has joined much of the rest of the enlightened world and is officially going to legalize Recreational cannabis.

357
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:33,774
Speaker 0: hasn't happened yet, but it's real soon.

358
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:34,799
Speaker 1: It's real soon.

359
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:42,536
Speaker 1: No one's gonna be able to buy it in New York probably for over a year because now They have to write all the actual laws because it's all on the boat.

360
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:43,179
Speaker 0: We're getting stuck.

361
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:51,260
Speaker 0: All the weed all the the weed from the other side Choice weed is just feeling what whole shipping container.

362
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:55,079
Speaker 1: I just imagine one dude sitting on that boat and being like it's gonna go bad.

363
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:57,070
Speaker 0: There's a shipping container on the boat.

364
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,773
Speaker 0: It says like weed to New York It's jam-packed like the most.

365
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:02,860
Speaker 1: it finally gets to New York.

366
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,440
Speaker 1: There's gonna be one dude passed out in the empty container.

367
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,930
Speaker 0: He's like he was the guy who's working on the boat.

368
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,936
Speaker 0: He's like, you know, he's like.

369
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:14,264
Speaker 0: I had so much time I was actually able to look through all the containers figure out what was in him And I had.

370
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:15,150
Speaker 0: I had nothing to do.

371
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,935
Speaker 0: it couldn't go anywhere.

372
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:16,740
Speaker 0: I had to stay on the boat.

373
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:17,657
Speaker 0: What else is I gonna do?

374
00:24:18,481 --> 00:24:23,260
Speaker 1: So it'll be a while But it's really good news because it was a while ever in Massachusetts legalized.

375
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:26,098
Speaker 1: It actually took a while for there to actually be places to buy it.

376
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:39,157
Speaker 1: but the important part is that the The framework and the laws that are actually going to make this happen for real are Very focused on restorative justice to the people who were harmed by the drug wars.

377
00:24:39,218 --> 00:24:43,210
Speaker 1: up to this point It's not enough like it's a lot.

378
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,275
Speaker 1: I want to make it clear.

379
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:48,200
Speaker 1: This is not enough But the fact that it's a lot is something.

380
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:54,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know voting matters in New York just some years ago in recent memory, right?

381
00:24:54,761 --> 00:25:02,603
Speaker 0: There was a situation where like there was a group of you know Democrats in quotes right who were basically Republicans.

382
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:11,410
Speaker 0: they voted with the Republicans even though when you went to go vote on the ballot, they would be labeled as Democrat and We used to complain about them weirdly often on geek night.

383
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,591
Speaker 1: Yes.

384
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:16,246
Speaker 0: Yeah a government our governor or was Shockingly still our governor, right?

385
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:22,860
Speaker 0: Nobody here likes him, but yeah, yeah Republicans don't like him because he's not a Republican and Democrats Don't like him because he's a Republican.

386
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:31,819
Speaker 0: But he Yeah, he helped those people get into position so that he would have more power, right?

387
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:40,293
Speaker 0: Otherwise the state legislature if it was all Democrats would just you know Be passing very progressive things that he didn't the governor doesn't like.

388
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:48,105
Speaker 0: he's not that progressive or at least, you know Sometimes they'll pretend to be anyway, but yeah, we voted we got rid of those people enough of them So that they don't matter anymore.

389
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:54,871
Speaker 1: and guess what when actual Democrats controlled our state Senate suddenly New York's passing a lot of really good legislation.

390
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,920
Speaker 0: We did everything except cancel rent.

391
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:02,436
Speaker 0: We did some stuff to help prevent people from getting evicted, but we weren't able to cancel rent.

392
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:03,299
Speaker 0: We did everything else.

393
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:04,804
Speaker 1: Yep, but look at this.

394
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:05,265
Speaker 1: We did.

395
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:10,240
Speaker 1: we got some real change that helped people as opposed to change that actively harmed people.

396
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:13,746
Speaker 1: mm-hmm and You only do an article.

397
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:19,528
Speaker 1: it talks about the specific social equity things that they're doing to make to Apply some restorative justice.

398
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:20,594
Speaker 1: It's all pretty good stuff.

399
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:21,660
Speaker 1: The taxes are reasonable.

400
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,762
Speaker 0: They're

401
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:38,379
Speaker 1: projecting like I don't even know where the number is But the number they had for like how much tax revenue they think they'll get in the first year after this goes live Like we could rebuild the whole fucking New York subway, of course I don't know what's gonna actually happen with that money and we'll see there's gonna be a

402
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:38,520
Speaker 0: lot.

403
00:26:39,662 --> 00:26:47,982
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of the money is gonna go into the pocket of like, you know The guy with the bodega at the end of the street whose entire window is full of bongs Got?

404
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:50,971
Speaker 0: he's got CBD and he's got vapes and whatever.

405
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Speaker 0: right once that guy could just sell just fucking weed.

406
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:56,649
Speaker 0: He is gonna be banking it right?

407
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,332
Speaker 0: It's time.

408
00:26:57,352 --> 00:27:02,599
Speaker 0: Like if you had money in New York right now Why not buy one of those bong bodegas?

409
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, like your future is that is a good investment.

410
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:08,359
Speaker 1: right now It looks like it covers some states have kind of messed this up.

411
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:12,778
Speaker 1: It also covers some things like you will be allowed to grow your own if you want to just for some limits.

412
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:22,023
Speaker 1: some states Yeah, and it allows for establishments to allow people to consume cannabis in Semi public.

413
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:26,019
Speaker 1: like you could have a bar that allows cannabis or a restaurant that allows cannabis, which a lot of states don't allow.

414
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:29,749
Speaker 0: So they're actually making as long as it's not inside.

415
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:30,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

416
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,518
Speaker 1: Well, also a lot of cannabis isn't smoked.

417
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:33,040
Speaker 1: It's edible.

418
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if yeah, I guess if you're not smoking that go on.

419
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,202
Speaker 0: I do inside I don't but in many

420
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:53,830
Speaker 1: places it is illegal to consume it anywhere but your own home and I I do appreciate the fact that if you're gonna make something legal Then you should also remove like obviously don't let people smoke in public and around other people But don't make something legal and then say oh, but you have to hide it from everybody.

421
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:56,979
Speaker 1: mmm Like I just know.

422
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:57,222
Speaker 0: you know.

423
00:27:58,211 --> 00:27:59,927
Speaker 0: My only concern is I just don't want it to.

424
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:06,755
Speaker 0: you know I want everyone who wants to smoke weed to be able to do so without going to jail or anything like that Also without doing it right next to me.

425
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:09,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just don't want it to smell like weed everywhere.

426
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:19,749
Speaker 1: Yep Not in my apartment in New York, like when I go for my half marathons, it smells like weed like everywhere already.

427
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:24,526
Speaker 0: As long as it doesn't, you know, I mean you expect it sometimes to go to a concert.

428
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:25,510
Speaker 0: It's gonna smell like weed.

429
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:32,457
Speaker 1: You'll get a whiff when you're walking by but I don't want it to be a whiff coming in my window From the downstairs balcony every.

430
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:39,566
Speaker 0: if I'm in a situation where I'm in like a restaurant and I just want to you know Eat food outside and it smells like weed outside and I'm sitting still.

431
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:40,350
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna look.

432
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,496
Speaker 0: I got to leave the restaurant.

433
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:42,541
Speaker 0: I can't be sitting here.

434
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:44,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that is the same as cigarettes Like.

435
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,766
Speaker 1: that's how I think of that.

436
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:53,869
Speaker 1: Like if someone lights a cigarette within like a couple hundred yards of me I can smell it instantly know exactly where it is.

437
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:57,808
Speaker 0: And this isn't even to mention anything about the harms of inhaling whatever, right?

438
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,970
Speaker 0: It's just like, you know, if there was someone just set off a harmless stink bomb in the restaurant.

439
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:04,168
Speaker 0: It's like I don't want to stay there.

440
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:08,929
Speaker 0: You know as far as I know skunk spray doesn't hurt you other than making it smell real bad, right?

441
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,173
Speaker 0: Maybe it does.

442
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:12,802
Speaker 0: I don't know but but it just smelled.

443
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:14,147
Speaker 0: if it smells like skunk.

444
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,010
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be mad.

445
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:20,130
Speaker 0: I don't care how much it hurts me or not But the fact that it could hurt me I just only makes it worse from what I read.

446
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:30,209
Speaker 1: The legislation is also informed by particularly how legalization went in Colorado and Washington Because a lot of states have done it different ways and they kind of fucked up parts of it.

447
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:36,972
Speaker 1: But yep studies have shown like studies by the states meaning they have a vested interest in finding out if they need to change their laws.

448
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:43,722
Speaker 1: in Washington and in Colorado there have been no Significant negative consequences like that is a very.

449
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:45,087
Speaker 0: you don't say that.

450
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:51,654
Speaker 1: Oh Nothing, particularly bad happened Like you use didn't know Like.

451
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:54,790
Speaker 1: like basically the only said on that not drawback.

452
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,237
Speaker 1: The only side effects were way fewer.

453
00:29:57,497 --> 00:30:02,986
Speaker 1: non-white people were going to jail and there's a whole bunch of tax dollars huh.

454
00:30:05,214 --> 00:30:12,679
Speaker 0: So, yeah, so I you know while it's it's you know that on the tax dollars while that's nice You know, it's still a regressive tax.

455
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:13,943
Speaker 0: Well, yeah text the rich text.

456
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,668
Speaker 0: You should text the rich and not the weed.

457
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,656
Speaker 1: Yes I am I'm not.

458
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,469
Speaker 0: texting the weed is basically just like a lubricant to get it through a legislature.

459
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:26,156
Speaker 0: at this point It's not actually something I approve of.

460
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:30,588
Speaker 1: if anything text alcohol a lot more and don't tell you because if someone's

461
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,909
Speaker 0: gonna use text Alcohol and cars

462
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:41,332
Speaker 1: alcohol kills so many people and We just it's not gonna kill a lot of people like the harms I'm actually I

463
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:50,662
Speaker 0: am actually hoping that just naturally without any intent the Legalization of weed just naturally results in less alcohol.

464
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:52,206
Speaker 1: So it might be to hold.

465
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:53,710
Speaker 0: some might be too hopeful.

466
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,990
Speaker 1: So I'm hopeful but I've shown that that appears to be true, but I don't I don't care about the studies.

467
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:00,652
Speaker 1: You know why.

468
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:01,415
Speaker 1: I think that's true.

469
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:10,662
Speaker 1: all the alcohol companies started investing heavily in cannabis Mmm, they know that this is going to their alcohol industry is going to shrink.

470
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:12,948
Speaker 0: They're gonna make weed alcohol.

471
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:14,974
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, yeah, there are.

472
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:15,355
Speaker 1: there are.

473
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:22,920
Speaker 1: in fact if you get a tincture tinctures literally are just cannabis dissolved in alcohol But it's not a lot of alcohol because otherwise you're gonna have a problem.

474
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:25,849
Speaker 0: So it's like vanilla extract of weed basically.

475
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:32,214
Speaker 1: Yeah So you could put it in your cookies or whatever exactly or put like one drop onto your tongue Like that's how they get used.

476
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,242
Speaker 1: those came out of mostly medical stuff.

477
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,270
Speaker 1: But anyway, you can read this article.

478
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:45,997
Speaker 1: it has all the juicy details and While you can't buy it in New York probably until around this time next year If the race is on now,

479
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,252
Speaker 0: New York and Massachusetts bring it in, you know Yeah,

480
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:53,929
Speaker 1: Massachusetts is making bad because it's very funny If you look at where the dispensaries are in Massachusetts where it's

481
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:56,775
Speaker 0: Right next to the fireworks.

482
00:31:56,835 --> 00:32:01,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all so literally like if you go from New York into Massachusetts.

483
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:10,710
Speaker 1: There's one like right there and almost every major freeway And all of all the cars parked in the parking lots are New York plates because we actually pass them on our way up to now

484
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:14,454
Speaker 0: entering now entering Tennessee Fireworks liquor store

485
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:15,036
Speaker 1: and you

486
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:15,799
Speaker 0: might go

487
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,909
Speaker 1: well since it's federally illegal and it's illegal in New York.

488
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,780
Speaker 1: Why don't the cops care that it's all New York plates?

489
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,946
Speaker 1: and the answer is they're Massachusetts cops.

490
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:26,490
Speaker 1: it ain't illegal in Massachusetts.

491
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:32,010
Speaker 1: They give zero fucks about New York and they're more than happy to get those tax dollars from New Yorkers.

492
00:32:32,932 --> 00:32:35,116
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like Oh New York money coming into Massachusetts.

493
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:35,577
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

494
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:43,876
Speaker 1: But anyway things Of the day.

495
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,444
Speaker 1: This is just too cute.

496
00:32:45,544 --> 00:32:49,555
Speaker 1: This is just a Long Series of photos.

497
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:53,510
Speaker 1: it's before and after photos of people's pets dogs cats even a rabbit.

498
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:55,356
Speaker 0: But before after what?

499
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:59,930
Speaker 1: so it's before and after young old young calling them a good boy.

500
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:02,436
Speaker 1: You take a picture of your dog.

501
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:05,530
Speaker 1: Then you say like good boy, and then immediately take another picture.

502
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:09,243
Speaker 0: All right, I guess some some animals would react and some wouldn't.

503
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:17,930
Speaker 1: it's interesting because the dogs Almost universally like emote in a very human way and likes visibly smile and react.

504
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,218
Speaker 1: The birds also react very strongly.

505
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,084
Speaker 1: the cats like with the first cat.

506
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:24,950
Speaker 1: the cat literally just turns around and sits down.

507
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,461
Speaker 0: Why would you do two photos though?

508
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:28,647
Speaker 0: I feel like just do have a video.

509
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:34,776
Speaker 0: just you know It's a listicle but It's I mean with the photos.

510
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:38,630
Speaker 0: with the photos you could just take two photos and say that one was the after one.

511
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:39,418
Speaker 1: I mean you could.

512
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:40,630
Speaker 1: this could be entirely faked.

513
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:43,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, the video I think is much better and we give it.

514
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:48,495
Speaker 0: you'd see the transition right from the normal face to the the happy Face and that would be much more.

515
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:53,496
Speaker 1: the best one is the rabbit because there's good boy to the rabbit and the next picture It's the rabbit just is slightly closer.

516
00:33:53,516 --> 00:33:54,480
Speaker 0: You know, it's a boy rabbit.

517
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:57,430
Speaker 1: I mean it might not be.

518
00:33:58,341 --> 00:33:59,953
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

519
00:34:00,114 --> 00:34:05,501
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day out in the country of Slovenia where I've never been but maybe one day I'll go there.

520
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,324
Speaker 1: I would really like to go.

521
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:06,625
Speaker 0: not in.

522
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:07,850
Speaker 0: there's not a pandemic.

523
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:16,009
Speaker 0: They have a computer history museum and in their computer history museum They have many cool things such as a whole bunch of terminals, right?

524
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:23,342
Speaker 0: Terminals the likes of which you may not have, you know, some of which I've seen a VT 100 a VT 220 What the hell's a paka 3100, right?

525
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:29,770
Speaker 0: It's like or you know, I think I've seen Adma three A's or ADM three A's, right?

526
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:36,368
Speaker 1: But yeah a whole lot of cool terminals And that just looks like a modern modern a CRT from the late 90s.

527
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:42,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Here's this article about a very interesting installation.

528
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:48,426
Speaker 0: They have there and in this installation They've got you know, like a deck VT 320, right?

529
00:34:49,429 --> 00:35:20,476
Speaker 0: they got some terminals and they got you know, some big old old-school computers and they got a Enormous dot matrix printer from way back in the day, right and this person has set up a system whereby there is a An old original Game Boy with the Game Boy camera in it and you take a photo with the old Game Boy camera and this original Game Boy and Then you go over to this terminal and you can print out on the dot matrix printer the photo you took With the Game Boy and

530
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,023
Speaker 1: basically like ASCII it is beautiful.

531
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:35,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is a Terrific thing going on the Slovenian computer Museum interactive exhibits like that because it's one thing to look at it all computer and go wow That's an old computer, but to actually interact with weird old technology.

532
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:36,930
Speaker 1: I think is important.

533
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,499
Speaker 0: I would really love to maybe like.

534
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,050
Speaker 0: that could be a really cool thing to do is like, you know There's computer museums all around the world in various places.

535
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:48,590
Speaker 0: What if we toured the computer museums of the world?

536
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,019
Speaker 0: We just went to every computer museum that you could.

537
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,790
Speaker 1: you could do like a long-running series on that.

538
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,877
Speaker 0: Basically you'd run you'd be able to do them all.

539
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:59,129
Speaker 0: there can't be that many right, but it would still be cool.

540
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:04,277
Speaker 1: Hey if any of you are rich and you want to fund that if you if you can pay us to live We'll fucking do it.

541
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:06,877
Speaker 0: Oh Just just an aside.

542
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:07,943
Speaker 0: This is my thing of the day.

543
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:09,270
Speaker 0: There's a guy called.

544
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:13,989
Speaker 0: He's a sort of this semi famous camera dude named Japan camera hunter.

545
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:20,490
Speaker 0: His stick is like you want to buy a camera, but you don't want to cut you want to get it.

546
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,250
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure you made him a thing of the day in a distant past.

547
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:28,150
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe but like you can you can have him go and buy a camera in Japan for you and then he'll mail it to you.

548
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:39,189
Speaker 0: But he went to the somewhat new ish Nikon museum that is opened in Japan and he made a YouTube video where he goes to every single part of it.

549
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:50,170
Speaker 0: They had like the world's largest like glass ingot there and such You know all kinds of cameras that went to space all that kind of shit.

550
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:54,009
Speaker 0: It was like I've seen the whole museum on YouTube, but I want to go there now anyway.

551
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:55,834
Speaker 0: So that's cool.

552
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,370
Speaker 1: in the minute moment, we're actually reading the tale of Genji so read along with us.

553
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,078
Speaker 1: It's the first novel like ever.

554
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:03,222
Speaker 1: that's the first one.

555
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:07,075
Speaker 1: if you're gonna read any novels at some point in your life You got to read the first one.

556
00:37:07,617 --> 00:37:10,389
Speaker 0: You're gonna have a lot of time to read while you're waiting for the boat to show up.

557
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,039
Speaker 0: His long book will you know get you through?

558
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,250
Speaker 0: and then once you've read the first book you can read the second novel.

559
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,277
Speaker 0: Whatever that is someone.

560
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:21,816
Speaker 0: let me know what the second novel ever is Because that's what we have to read.

561
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:22,157
Speaker 0: next.

562
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:25,570
Speaker 0: we're gonna start at the beginning read every novel ever written by.

563
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:39,850
Speaker 1: I still remember to this day the first novel I ever started reading and Stopped reading and chose to never read another page again in my life And it was piers anthony's chimeras copper.

564
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:52,242
Speaker 0: Okay, the first novel I read and stopped reading and didn't finish was I Don't even know I was so mad at that book like I got.

565
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:58,543
Speaker 1: it was a trilogy and I read dragons gold It's I. I read serpent silver is alright, and then chimeras copper.

566
00:37:58,623 --> 00:38:02,136
Speaker 1: I sort of realized that this whole thing was just bad And I don't know.

567
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,564
Speaker 0: I don't think I don't even know if there was.

568
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:04,770
Speaker 0: I can't remember one.

569
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:09,890
Speaker 1: Anyway, I guess I also didn't actually finish reading great expectations.

570
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:13,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so let's do some meta.

571
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:15,370
Speaker 0: Oh, we're already in the meta moment.

572
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:21,710
Speaker 1: Any other meta moment to say there is potentially there's light at the end of the tunnel and a post-covid world.

573
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,803
Speaker 1: So maybe in 2022, we'll start talking about conventions again.

574
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,290

00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,090
Speaker 1: In particular I call your attention to.

598
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:26,472
Speaker 1: Steam has a capability if you're not aware where you can curate a collection of games with like your own review like here is a Curated collection of recommended games Scott is looking at like fleshing that out without the games We like.

599
00:39:26,513 --> 00:39:27,136
Speaker 0: and yeah, we have this.

600
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,770
Speaker 0: we have a steam an official geek night steam group.

601
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:36,809
Speaker 0: It's existed for a very long time But I actually went and messed with it the week or two ago and maybe we'll pay more attention to it.

602
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:53,526
Speaker 1: Yep Similarly I am looking at cuz my board game geek account is where I post all of our game reviews to board game geek and I poked in there a couple weeks ago and a lot of people are engaging with that content like hmm more like Dozens of people are like commenting on a lot of those videos.

603
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:54,230
Speaker 1: I was surprised.

604
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:59,690
Speaker 0: We also we even have a subreddit that has been extremely rarely used, but it exists.

605
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:07,394
Speaker 1: So the newest post and there's probably several you're interested in or would like interact with or use Either of those.

606
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:17,049
Speaker 1: let us know because if you're interested and we tend like you want to help us or if you're interested You just tell us yeah I'd use the hell out of a curated like board game review on board game geek.

607
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:22,190
Speaker 1: That'll encourage me or Scott or both of us to continue to poke at these things.

608
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,257
Speaker 1: mmm No, I guess we just do the main bit.

609
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:28,641
Speaker 0: what should I eat for dinner?

610
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,710
Speaker 1: Uh, we had a late lunch of yumplings.

611
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:38,411
Speaker 1: So yumplings you say yeah, so we might have a light dinner cuz that was a lot of we I.

612
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:39,574
Speaker 0: how many yumplings did you get?

613
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:41,359
Speaker 1: I ate 12 dumplings.

614
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,921
Speaker 0: you ate 12.

615
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:45,010
Speaker 0: We hope we get eight and we we get not eight.

616
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:48,180
Speaker 1: We got 24 and I ate 12 of them.

617
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, we get 12 and eat six each.

618
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:53,569
Speaker 0: You don't get 12 and eat 12 each.

619
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,308
Speaker 1: All right, let's see.

620
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:03,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard to beat that yumpling in this area.

621
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:09,323
Speaker 0: All right, you need like a soup dumpling to like challenge it right?

622
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:11,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but soup dumplings don't survive delivery.

623
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,094
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

624
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:13,221
Speaker 0: That's I'm saying.

625
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:14,730
Speaker 0: but that's why the yumpling is so terrific.

626
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:26,410
Speaker 1: If someone can make technology to deliver a soup dumpling completely intact and perfect They could be a robot that delivers and it has soup finishes like it makes the road.

627
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:29,270
Speaker 1: It makes the dumpling outside your door before it rings the doorbell.

628
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:38,090
Speaker 0: It's making them on the way to you and they're ready as soon as it or at times it so with their final one is Ready as it when it arrives at the door and it just gives you the steamer basket that just finished.

629
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:43,809
Speaker 1: Oh for all that have a food truck that literally just like makes the food and drives around dropping it off in real time.

630
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:47,278
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway, let's do the main bit.

631
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:52,905
Speaker 1: so Solitaire puzzles and games and stuffy.

632
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:53,670
Speaker 1: I even said games.

633
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:54,615
Speaker 0: I think this.

634
00:41:55,137 --> 00:42:01,244
Speaker 0: this could be arguably a Tuesday show but Technically speaking these things are not.

635
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,530
Speaker 0: at least they're not ortho games.

636
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:03,696
Speaker 1: They're not ortho games.

637
00:42:03,776 --> 00:42:06,290
Speaker 1: unless you add a meta layer above them of some kind.

638
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:10,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can do the crossword puzzle the fastest kind of thing.

639
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:15,870
Speaker 1: And while they are interactive amusements That is it that I like that definite.

640
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:20,206
Speaker 1: They're also a series of interesting decisions depending on what type of thing you're engaged with.

641
00:42:20,627 --> 00:42:25,430
Speaker 1: not necessarily But they fit some definitions of game but not other definitions of game.

642
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:31,822
Speaker 1: Not just because we're hurting for Thursday episodes are we doing this now but also because which we are make no mistake We are hurting for Thursday.

643
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:50,566
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah But I guess this also shows that like the topics like when people talk about things generally there's actually a lot of nuance and gray areas and spectrums and fuzziness and People who try to categorize things very black and white like that is a game.

644
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:51,450
Speaker 1: That is not a game.

645
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:56,729
Speaker 1: Those are the rules of conversation tend to be insufferable people and tend to miss out on a lot.

646
00:42:57,231 --> 00:43:00,224
Speaker 0: So well, it's you know, I always say it's like, you know, there's semantics.

647
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:01,650
Speaker 0: you can have a semantic discussion.

648
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:03,309
Speaker 0: What does this word mean, right?

649
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:13,238
Speaker 0: And then you can sort of you know, since we have brains we can figure out even if someone uses words that technically mean X You know that that person means why right?

650
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:14,542
Speaker 0: There's just not better words.

651
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:25,950
Speaker 0: and but there's you know, just because something is Semantically, you know Logical that doesn't necessarily mean that the reality underlying the semantics follows the same rules, right?

652
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,350
Speaker 0: It's like oh you've category.

653
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:32,870
Speaker 0: You've correctly decided that that is the word game applies to that thing and not that thing.

654
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,100
Speaker 0: But nothing about the world is any different.

655
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,190
Speaker 0: That's just something about the English language is different, right?

656
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:46,670
Speaker 0: It doesn't have any actual meaning for like what you're gonna do with your life, right or what decisions you should or should not make But also anyway in the way we break up geek nights.

657
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:49,784
Speaker 1: We're talking about these in terms of like a lot of like.

658
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:55,590
Speaker 1: we're not gonna talk about the game Mechanics of these things as much as this is a social and human topic.

659
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,046
Speaker 1: There's a lot more going on here and what we actually want to talk about, right?

660
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:08,422
Speaker 0: So, you know my whole life especially in the days before things like smartphones Game boys, right, you know those sorts of things.

661
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:13,137
Speaker 0: you wanted something Portable that was entertainment.

662
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:17,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was really hard to beat the old, you know, there were really two things.

663
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:21,166
Speaker 0: I remember we'd go on family trips and our parents would buy us.

664
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:21,830
Speaker 0: They still make them.

665
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,144
Speaker 0: There's these yes and no invisible ink books.

666
00:44:24,466 --> 00:44:32,601
Speaker 0: Yeah it's a book that comes with a Pen and the pen is filled with this invisible ink, right?

667
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,590
Speaker 1: I found a picture of yes and no specifically.

668
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:42,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you basically there's all these different activities in the book and you engage with the activities by.

669
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:50,371
Speaker 0: You know rubbing this, you know special pen on the paper and it reveals like this this line that's been hidden or that You know these.

670
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:56,410
Speaker 0: there's markings that have been hidden on the page and this various, you know games and other games again, right?

671
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:03,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of them are just like trivia questions and you're trying to rub the correct answer and you know Because it's a permanent thing.

672
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:06,570
Speaker 0: It's like you can sort of see how well you did on the trivia, right?

673
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:11,741
Speaker 0: You could just completely rub every single page But that would sort of be defeating the purpose.

674
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, and and then So those were.

675
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:19,363
Speaker 0: I really like those and then there were also You know, you'd go to the grocery store and there would be like.

676
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:26,650
Speaker 0: I think I don't know if it still exists It was like games magazine even it was basically just like a or various like books you can get for real cheap.

677
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:30,710
Speaker 0: It was like penny press kind of thing I'll wear for a few dollars.

678
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:35,870
Speaker 0: You can get this big old fat book and it might just be like a thousand crossword puzzles a thousand word searches.

679
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:43,562
Speaker 0: But the best ones are the variety ones because they had stuff like p cross Sudoku Cryptograms the logic puzzles.

680
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:44,510
Speaker 0: I really like those ones.

681
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:49,529
Speaker 0: Just you know, some of them like some of them I couldn't really figure out how to do.

682
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,415
Speaker 0: Instructions weren't great.

683
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:51,877
Speaker 0: So I wouldn't.

684
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:52,660
Speaker 0: I would just skip though.

685
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,334
Speaker 1: They're very much adjacent to those little like Plastic games.

686
00:45:56,374 --> 00:46:07,199
Speaker 1: that would be like a little piece of plastic like a little like a size of a cell phone But thicker filled with ball bearings and some sort of way to flick the ball bearings around and there'd be like puzzles and things To do with the ball bearings.

687
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:08,570
Speaker 1: It's an adjacent space.

688
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:12,970
Speaker 0: Yeah nowadays all of these things have been just been turned into cell phone apps, right?

689
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,210
Speaker 0: It's like you don't need to buy a crossword puzzle paper book.

690
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,724
Speaker 0: You can just get the New York Times crossword puzzle app on your phone.

691
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:19,629
Speaker 0: You're good to go.

692
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:19,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

693
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:26,563
Speaker 1: and even kids like there's kid tablets and like kid versions of phones that are durable and have the same thing and These still exist.

694
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,089
Speaker 1: They're out there.

695
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:33,390
Speaker 1: I think they still serve a purpose especially because you know kids like they like to engage with tactile things sometimes.

696
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:37,286
Speaker 1: But these are a big part of my childhood because well, I could just read.

697
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:41,166
Speaker 1: you might say but room is God If you're bored, what's more entertaining and portable than a book?

698
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:41,910
Speaker 1: And yes, that's true.

699
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:51,950
Speaker 1: I won a lot of people like I'm one of those people cannot read Like long texts in a moving vehicle without getting no readily sick and getting a headache.

700
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:56,610
Speaker 1: Same same like if I read more than a paragraph of text in a moving vehicle.

701
00:46:57,072 --> 00:46:58,719
Speaker 1: I'm basically fucked for like four hours.

702
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,664
Speaker 1: Like I just have.

703
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:04,300
Speaker 0: only if it only if it's a car I'm good on the bus or the train or the plane.

704
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,407
Speaker 1: Just not a car car a bus.

705
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,798
Speaker 1: I actually have trouble with two But granted New York bus.

706
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:15,069
Speaker 1: I haven't really ridden other buses in a long time Mmm, but anyway, yeah.

707
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:17,396
Speaker 1: But also these things like it's.

708
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:21,830
Speaker 1: it's not like a book is of one kind of entertainment, but sometimes you're bored.

709
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:29,049
Speaker 1: But you want a more interactive kind of entertainment and that's where these things always shine like I want to do something.

710
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:32,810
Speaker 1: I want a more active activity instead of a passive activity.

711
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:37,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know a book sort of fills that need of you know length, right?

712
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,490
Speaker 0: It's like I want to dive deep into some fictional world for a period of time, right?

713
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:48,661
Speaker 0: You know, so it's good before bed on the beach or you're there for hours or who knows right how long you're there Right, you know a comic book or maybe smaller, right?

714
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,830
Speaker 0: You can do the same thing only in a shorter burst.

715
00:47:52,212 --> 00:47:53,157
Speaker 0: You know the puzzle book.

716
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:54,182
Speaker 0: it's like you can just open it up.

717
00:47:54,222 --> 00:47:56,774
Speaker 0: do a puzzle do part of a puzzle You know, there's no.

718
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:58,501
Speaker 0: you can stop it start it.

719
00:47:58,561 --> 00:47:59,645
Speaker 0: It doesn't even matter right.

720
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:00,388
Speaker 0: you can change.

721
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:00,930
Speaker 0: you don't like it.

722
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:02,089
Speaker 0: Go to a different one, right?

723
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:03,573
Speaker 0: You know who cares?

724
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:05,340
Speaker 0: no one's like grading you on your puzzle book.

725
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:08,694
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid like the mazes were the ones I was the most into.

726
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:16,762
Speaker 0: I love a good maze, but the problem is a maze is like, you know Sort of like really quick and then it's over and there's only a few mazes or

727
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:24,830
Speaker 1: it's literally just random and you'll sit there forever Trial and error like there's no technique Only go turn left.

728
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,176
Speaker 0: I always thought I was I thought always thought it was clever starting at the end of the maze But it's like.

729
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:30,550
Speaker 0: well, that's just the same thing.

730
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,373
Speaker 0: I started get the start.

731
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:38,790
Speaker 1: the difference is I there were a lot of mazes the way they were designed where They were designed to be difficult going one way because you'd make a lot of dead ends.

732
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:45,919
Speaker 1: But if you come in but there's only one true path if you come in from the exit a lot of times You basically what if I just took?

733
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:48,610
Speaker 0: what if I took the same exact maze and I took the word?

734
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,388
Speaker 0: entrance and I put it where the word exit was and I put the word exit and then put it where the entrance was?

735
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:55,588
Speaker 1: depending On how the maze was designed that mayor may not have an impact.

736
00:48:57,272 --> 00:48:59,240
Speaker 1: May just like how you can design a very you're not.

737
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,490
Speaker 0: the point is you're not clever for starting at the exit.

738
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:06,512
Speaker 1: Well, or you're as clever as you were expected to be Sure.

739
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:11,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ones the things that I actually enjoyed the most in this genre once I was older than like five or six years old.

740
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:17,730
Speaker 1: we're specifically Books like the Encyclopaedia Brown style, but there's a lot of series of this.

741
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:27,304
Speaker 1: we're like you get a really short story and then there'd be a question at the end like that was sort of a logic puzzle and That at the back of the book usually printed like upside down or backwards.

742
00:49:27,324 --> 00:49:29,190
Speaker 1: You needed a mirror would be the answer.

743
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,050
Speaker 0: My favorite was similar to that.

744
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,262
Speaker 0: It was the actual logic puzzles and but the way those would work is.

745
00:49:35,302 --> 00:49:37,550
Speaker 0: they would be like a few sentences, right?

746
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,949
Speaker 0: And it would be like, you know, Joe's hat isn't green.

747
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,593
Speaker 0: Sue has You know A brother?

748
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:50,166
Speaker 1: I actually really enjoyed that kind of puzzle that I think.

749
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:53,154
Speaker 1: that's why I like that one PI detective game.

750
00:49:53,194 --> 00:49:59,013
Speaker 0: we played a fax with Anthony that one time and it's like they give you the the minimum number of facts Possible.

751
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:14,370
Speaker 0: and then there's this grid and it's like they like it'd be like it right and it's like, okay Well, there's this five people there's five items and this you know, and there's you know, it's like, you know You know Sue's brother has a you know doesn't have an umbrella, right?

752
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:23,910
Speaker 0: It's like you got to put all these facts together and there's this grid where you can put X's and say okay a process Right Sue doesn't have a green hat.

753
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,895
Speaker 0: So you go from Sue.

754
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:31,290
Speaker 0: you go to the right and you find the green hat column and you put an X and then you Go to the green hat column and you put an X in the other side, right?

755
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,555
Speaker 0: It's two-dimensional logic.

756
00:50:32,977 --> 00:50:35,327
Speaker 0: and then you basically X off right.

757
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,674
Speaker 0: the things, you know aren't true.

758
00:50:36,794 --> 00:50:42,943
Speaker 0: and you put if something is true you put a Circle and you X off all the things that conflict with that.

759
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:44,910
Speaker 0: when you find a circle you just X off everything else.

760
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,917
Speaker 0: Right because you know that that's the right answer.

761
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:58,049
Speaker 0: and it's very similar to p-cross in a way But it's more like p-cross with a plot whereas actual p-cross, which I also enjoy is is is produces like an image, right?

762
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:02,807
Speaker 0: Whereas this produces an answer to two questions about a motherfucker.

763
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:03,670
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

764
00:51:03,871 --> 00:51:08,010
Speaker 1: So one of those books this is this is like the peak of irony.

765
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:10,210
Speaker 1: I don't remember what this book was called.

766
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:19,152
Speaker 1: I don't remember any other mystery from this book Like it was framed as you would be presented with a court case and then you'd have to be the jury like guilty or not Guilty.

767
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:23,030
Speaker 1: and then in the back of the book was here's the actual situations.

768
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:26,570
Speaker 1: You'd find out if you sent someone innocent to jail or you let a murderer get free or whatever.

769
00:51:27,273 --> 00:51:31,207
Speaker 1: I don't remember anything from this book except of the mysteries that were in it.

770
00:51:31,228 --> 00:51:49,278
Speaker 1: I Accidentally opened the book one day and saw the answer to one of them And I and I was like five years of sex five or six years old and I remember thinking to myself I'm just gonna I'm just gonna not read that mystery and just try to forget and someday when I'm adult I can come back and do this one without it being spoiled.

771
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,904
Speaker 1: The newspaper was at fault.

772
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,590
Speaker 1: The fucking newspaper was at fault.

773
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:55,068
Speaker 1: I remember that but I don't remember what the case was.

774
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:01,810
Speaker 1: I specifically just now remembered something that I spent 31 years trying to forget.

775
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,790
Speaker 1: Well fucking brain god damn it the newspaper was at fault.

776
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:07,634
Speaker 1: I will never forget.

777
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:11,030
Speaker 0: you can just get a book of a hundred other mysteries that you can do instead.

778
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:15,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as a kid, I was so adamant that I need to forget this in the future.

779
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:20,510
Speaker 1: Mmm, I have not thought about that in decades.

780
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,235
Speaker 0: There was also the.

781
00:52:23,336 --> 00:52:26,026
Speaker 0: the cryptograms were kind of fun, right?

782
00:52:26,046 --> 00:52:31,890
Speaker 0: It would be like it would be like, alright Here's a sentence but all the letters of the alphabet are actually swapped with other letters of the alphabet.

783
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,919
Speaker 0: So it could be it's not rot 13 because that would be too easy.

784
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like okay baby code breaker, right?

785
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:43,805
Speaker 0: It's like a is actually s and T is actually Q and P is actually e. right.

786
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:46,635
Speaker 0: and you look all they do is give you A sentence and it's written.

787
00:52:46,676 --> 00:52:49,348
Speaker 0: all the letters are jumbled up and you sort of have to figure out.

788
00:52:49,468 --> 00:52:49,729
Speaker 0: Okay?

789
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,162
Speaker 0: Here's the letter Z all by itself as a single word.

790
00:52:54,402 --> 00:53:00,134
Speaker 0: That means Z has to either be a or I Or I guess that's it.

791
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:00,435
Speaker 0: Right?

792
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:02,181
Speaker 0: Is there any other one letter words?

793
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:04,429
Speaker 0: We'll say a or I. you know, okay.

794
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,515
Speaker 0: Well, there's a two letter.

795
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:13,959
Speaker 0: So now you look for other Z's and you're like, okay well here is a Word and it ends in two Z's.

796
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:16,647
Speaker 0: so ending in two eyes is pretty rare.

797
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:17,950
Speaker 0: Is it Pompeii, right?

798
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,265
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's probably You know to eat.

799
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,437
Speaker 0: I don't know right stuff like that.

800
00:53:23,457 --> 00:53:24,240
Speaker 0: and you have to figure out.

801
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:26,610
Speaker 0: you figure out some letters and you can figure other letters.

802
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,345
Speaker 0: But god the letter, you know L has appeared the most.

803
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:30,290
Speaker 0: that must be easy.

804
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:40,243
Speaker 1: It's the most things are appearing letter like sudoku and pi cross and what you just described because they're all sort of like an iterative logical process you can engage with in your brain.

805
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:50,148
Speaker 1: that is oddly Satisfying to resolve even though you're not doing anything particularly difficult or complex You're basically just implementing a simple algorithm in your brain.

806
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:51,496
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

807
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:54,130
Speaker 0: It's like that's the thing is when we play like a board game, right?

808
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,605
Speaker 0: Especially a new one or any new, you know video game or something.

809
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,870
Speaker 0: what's going on in your brain?

810
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:00,830
Speaker 0: Is you have no heuristic whatsoever?

811
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,935
Speaker 0: You are developing a heuristic.

812
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:07,730
Speaker 0: you're creating an algorithm doing real problem solving right is here is the thing.

813
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,750
Speaker 0: We need to get an answer, but we don't know how to get the answer.

814
00:54:12,051 --> 00:54:20,445
Speaker 0: We need to first figure out how to get the answer and then engage that mechanism That will produce the answer and then we can engage that mechanism as many times as we need to.

815
00:54:20,485 --> 00:54:24,979
Speaker 0: we can play settlers 10 times And I've already developed the mechanism and I'll play settlers 10 times.

816
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,967
Speaker 0: a sudoku a pi cross anything like that.

817
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:32,449
Speaker 0: is The mechanism is already known or it should be known.

818
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:32,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, my.

819
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:33,654
Speaker 0: if it's not known.

820
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:34,578
Speaker 1: first do sudoku.

821
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:47,227
Speaker 0: you might solve sudoku for the first time like oh You might not know that mechanism and you might it develop it But eventually you you're gonna have it and then you're just sort of doing the same work that a computer does.

822
00:54:47,267 --> 00:54:49,907
Speaker 0: you're just executing right on this process

823
00:54:51,171 --> 00:54:51,733
Speaker 1: And for some

824
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:53,859
Speaker 0: people like sometimes it's kind of nice

825
00:54:54,060 --> 00:55:03,657
Speaker 1: it's a soothing feeling it's because you know what it almost gives you a flow State but with no stakes like a lot of things like when I'm playing like I'm skiing or playing an advanced video game That I'm good at.

826
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:04,990
Speaker 1: you get that flow state.

827
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:22,590
Speaker 1: We're like you're a cheer succeeding and achieving and it might be definitely you're doing work either physical or mental but you're also succeeding at it as you go and you just like get into this groove and This is a easy way to get into like a limited version of that state very quickly as an amusement.

828
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,715
Speaker 1: I think there's something you know We talked about.

829
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:29,410
Speaker 0: you know, I'm obviously a knowledge worker as like according to capitalism, right?

830
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:49,789
Speaker 0: And you know, but and there's obviously a lot of disadvantages to doing some you know What class capitalism would say is not knowledge labor, right something that is like, I don't know filing papers in a filing cabinet or I Don't know stacking shelves in the grocery store, right just sort of like a menial repetitive task.

831
00:55:51,432 --> 00:56:03,610
Speaker 0: But when you see people who love grinding and RPGs and stuff like that It's like, you know, even my brain sometimes is in the mood, you know, not often In the mood for a menial repetitive task, right?

832
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:09,490
Speaker 0: So a menial repetitive task that actually has you know, some complexity to it, right?

833
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:16,670
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of crunch on it You know, that's like I guess human brains or at least many human brains like that sort of thing.

834
00:56:16,734 --> 00:56:25,197
Speaker 0: Yeah But what's interesting is and you got you wonder if you could figure out what sort of Brain someone has based on which puzzles in the puzzle book They like to do and which ones they skip.

835
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:32,652
Speaker 1: the the thing is the puzzle that I like the most is one that you can't Get except with electronics the water pitcher puzzle Doing.

836
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:36,090
Speaker 1: well, I could I could do water pitcher puzzles all day and not get tired of it for a while.

837
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, uh, you know, what's his name, right?

838
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:40,589
Speaker 0: Professor Layton.

839
00:56:41,391 --> 00:56:44,281
Speaker 0: Professor Layton is basically this in video game form.

840
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:54,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's also interesting because Some things that seem like a much more complex game when you're good at them become this like if I play nourishing my hex on my Phone.

841
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:55,795
Speaker 1: it's this.

842
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:56,939
Speaker 1: it's the same feeling.

843
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:57,923
Speaker 0: I'm not mad.

844
00:56:57,963 --> 00:56:58,385
Speaker 1: No point.

845
00:56:58,405 --> 00:56:59,670
Speaker 1: Do I make a difficult decision?

846
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:10,420
Speaker 1: I just go through the motions of implementing this algorithm that I have internalized in tune to a unconscious degree, uh Honestly slay the spire is like that.

847
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:13,670
Speaker 1: I'm not getting better at slay the spire in any meaningful way.

848
00:57:13,992 --> 00:57:14,294
Speaker 1: I'll play.

849
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:16,146
Speaker 0: so you kind of need to a little bit at least.

850
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:22,230
Speaker 1: yeah a little bit But it it's incremental like I'll lay it down in bed and just throw on a level 10 ascension slay the spire.

851
00:57:22,592 --> 00:57:24,764
Speaker 1: I just go through the motions and play it and it's just.

852
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:25,750
Speaker 1: it's really soothing.

853
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:31,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean sometimes you do develop new, you know tricks, right?

854
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:35,203
Speaker 0: Sometimes those tricks are actually, you know new right like you've.

855
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:42,710
Speaker 0: you've enhanced your your algorithm In a way, but sometimes it's you haven't actually like changed your process.

856
00:57:43,112 --> 00:57:46,387
Speaker 0: You've just sort of like rearranged your process in a brain.

857
00:57:46,507 --> 00:57:56,410
Speaker 0: in your brain It's like the have any with p-cross somewhat recently where it's like I wasn't able to solve, you know There was no p-cross before that I couldn't solve and there isn't one that I can't solve now.

858
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:58,330
Speaker 0: It's not like I upgraded my p-cross.

859
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:09,172
Speaker 0: But there are certain situations where I was evaluating them by counting in a certain way and then I realized Oh just count in this different way and it's like now I'm counting in a different way I can.

860
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:11,805
Speaker 0: you know, I'm crossing off the p-cross.

861
00:58:11,845 --> 00:58:12,890
Speaker 0: This is like a different order.

862
00:58:13,332 --> 00:58:17,930
Speaker 0: I'm still getting to the same end point in relatively, you know, it doesn't seem that much faster or anything.

863
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:23,069
Speaker 0: But it's like my brain decided to think about the p-cross process in a new way for some reason.

864
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:26,100
Speaker 0: You know, it just it just happens.

865
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,330
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know if it's good or bad or just nothing.

866
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:32,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like jigsaw puzzles are adjacent to all of this.

867
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:35,909
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely Some adjacency going on there.

868
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:39,749
Speaker 0: One thing I think we got to give a special mention is the crossword puzzle, right?

869
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:51,570
Speaker 1: so as a kid, I'll admit until I was like in in college, I Gave crossword puzzles the short shrift like I didn't respect them as much like I as a kid.

870
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:55,502
Speaker 1: I sort of thought they were a knowledge game primarily and I didn't really are kind of.

871
00:58:55,522 --> 00:59:05,234
Speaker 1: they are kind of vocabulary and now but they're Also a game of a little bit of tactics and strategy and being clever like you answer the questions You can answer.

872
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:09,330
Speaker 1: that gives you more ammo to go after the ones you're struggling with.

873
00:59:09,952 --> 00:59:13,029
Speaker 1: Like there's better game design there than I appreciated when I was younger.

874
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:18,234
Speaker 1: You know, I think also if it's a well-designed crossword puzzle Well, the other thing is ruined.

875
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:23,550
Speaker 1: a lot of schools, especially elementary schools will make crossword puzzles for the kids and they're just garbage.

876
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:27,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you you know the New York Times crossword puzzle if you're not familiar right.

877
00:59:28,005 --> 00:59:44,370
Speaker 0: basically on Monday It's pretty easy and then on Sunday it levels up throughout the week and on Sunday is a big hard one And then it goes back to easy again On Monday, so like that's their pattern and the Sunday ones always have some sort of clever trick to them.

878
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:58,130
Speaker 0: They'll always do these things like oh my god Look, there's the letter L and is on a diagonal or all the very long answers the ones that are like You know many letters long will have like a common theme to them or spell something out, right?

879
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:06,458
Speaker 0: so that gives you like additional clues not just the across clues and the down clues but There's extra information to go on.

880
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:14,607
Speaker 0: if you're extra clever and can spot what they're doing Right that can either a help you solve the crossword puzzle faster, right?

881
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:28,590
Speaker 0: Make you feel like you've discovered something when you see what they did or just reward you more for solving it the correct way And then seeing the clever thing they did with the with the crossword puzzle that you know Isn't just a straightforward crossword puzzle.

882
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:35,760
Speaker 1: But the other thing is as a kid a lot of the knowledge you needed to beat the crossword puzzles least that I'd like Remember trying to do in like the true knowledge.

883
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:37,490
Speaker 1: I didn't know I was that I was kid.

884
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:46,352
Speaker 1: That's why I was a kid cuz I was stupid like I didn't know things Yeah, and like I'd see my dad my mom or my dad cuz they both did like they like they'd said look at the ones They finish.

885
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:50,589
Speaker 1: I'd be like I didn't understand most of the answers when I was a little.

886
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,706
Speaker 0: yeah My grandmother was big on the crossword puzzle right near my uncle George.

887
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:55,770
Speaker 0: He plays the crossword puzzle.

888
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,098
Speaker 0: The crossword puzzle can also be a social thing.

889
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,310
Speaker 0: you know there's always that stereotype of like asking someone like hey What's a word?

890
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:14,370
Speaker 0: Right and you can not only get the clues from the clue, but also just looking at the letters.

891
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,393
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

892
01:01:15,413 --> 01:01:17,822
Speaker 0: You know I don't know what the hell the clue is.

893
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,813
Speaker 0: it's someone some celebrities name from a TV show I didn't watch.

894
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:26,457
Speaker 0: I can google it, but that would just be cheating, but I can see that It's like you know our blank M. Well.

895
01:01:26,477 --> 01:01:27,440
Speaker 0: I guess it must be rimmed.

896
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:28,812
Speaker 0: That's it.

897
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:29,596
Speaker 0: That's the only name.

898
01:01:29,676 --> 01:01:32,912
Speaker 0: I know that starts with our three letters that starts with R And ends with M.

899
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:37,929
Speaker 1: You know it's your vocabulary skills as an APA and M as in man.

900
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:41,080
Speaker 0: see Yep, it comes in with your addition.

901
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,790
Speaker 0: You know the actual trivia knowledge together the combo.

902
01:01:44,291 --> 01:01:54,349
Speaker 1: but the other thing I really appreciate about crossword puzzles is a well-designed one will have a lot of clues intersecting with a very little black space between them.

903
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:58,299
Speaker 1: the craft of constructing something like that just fascinates me.

904
01:01:59,266 --> 01:02:00,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, there has been some scandals.

905
01:02:02,943 --> 01:02:07,200
Speaker 0: We talk about the plagiarism going on, but yeah there, but for the mode.

906
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,499
Speaker 0: But you know someone made those crossword puzzles originally and that was hard work.

907
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:15,614
Speaker 0: And you know it's a. it's definitely a good person has to have to make one you have to have.

908
01:02:15,634 --> 01:02:25,593
Speaker 0: you know such an amount of Vocabulary and trivia knowledge that you can stump these really smart people out there Yeah, or do something so clever to where when they solve it.

909
01:02:25,613 --> 01:02:25,975
Speaker 1: They go.

910
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:27,099
Speaker 1: Huh well you look at that.

911
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:29,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's and you got to put that out.

912
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:31,783
Speaker 0: You know with regularity It's not.

913
01:02:31,823 --> 01:02:34,411
Speaker 0: it's not easy work to make the crossword puzzle.

914
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:38,730
Speaker 1: so speaking of things that don't require any mental effort And you go through the motions till they're done.

915
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:42,148
Speaker 0: I think we can end the show there All right good on for over an hour.

916
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,895
Speaker 0: Hockey games gonna start, and I need food.

917
01:02:44,076 --> 01:02:45,080
