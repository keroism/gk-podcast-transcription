42
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,628
Speaker 0: a lot I think the thing is even though it's a lot of news Most of the news there isn't much to say about other than it's a thing

43
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:56,010
Speaker 1: or There's too much to say to where that really would be its own show if we actually wanted to talk about it.

Speaker 1: That is like.

81
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,683
Speaker 1: that is a very easy mistake for a normal person to make.

82
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,650
Speaker 0: why is it not the same DLC for both?

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,111

00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:48,776
Speaker 0: next tiny news.

85
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:51,464
Speaker 0: So command and conquer the original and red alert.

86
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:56,199
Speaker 0: They made HD remasters And they're on Steam and they're only like 20 bucks.

87
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:59,150
Speaker 0: and I thought about it, but I did it.

88
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,036
Speaker 1: I. I also thought about it.

89
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,942
Speaker 1: The problem is command and conquer.

90
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,150
Speaker 1: one is not actually that good and well, I enjoyed it.

91
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,522
Speaker 1: I never actually beat it because I am so bad at RTS.

92
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:09,505
Speaker 1: is I did not.

93
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:11,412
Speaker 0: I had command and conquer red alert I also.

94
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,059
Speaker 0: I did not beat that or command and conquer.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,610
Speaker 1: I really only played command and conquer multiplayer.

96
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,138
Speaker 1: I almost never played the single-player campaign at any point.

97
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,690
Speaker 0: I tried I couldn't beat me multiplayer or single-player multiplayer.

98
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:24,602
Speaker 1: I played with friends of mine who were just as bad.

99
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:31,425
Speaker 1: either played with people who are Way better than we played literally with null modems or by calling each other like I play.

100
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:38,542
Speaker 0: I played with the dial-up modem against some kids in high school and I was building my base right and defending me.

101
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:40,270
Speaker 0: It's no rush and skit.

102
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:42,510
Speaker 0: No, I was you know, I scouted out a bit, right?

103
00:05:42,590 --> 00:06:02,949
Speaker 0: I sent some infantries here and there right and eventually I got a recon plane and I finally found them and the recon plane Revealed a circle of in the fog and in that circle, I saw some factories and I saw medium tanks so densely packed In their base that there was nowhere for them to move.

104
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:12,670
Speaker 0: Their base was just as it was buildings and a sheet of tanks just like bristling quivering With right and I was like how the fuck did they do that?

105
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,221
Speaker 0: Clearly I saw get this game because I don't know what the hell they did.

106
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,110
Speaker 0: I've got some tanks.

107
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:28,877
Speaker 1: I feel like you to this day of that same problem in Civilization because you'll be like feeling pretty good got some science finally got some crossbowmen and then like the bombard rolls over the horizon Yeah, it's like.

108
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,530
Speaker 0: what did you do to do that or not?

109
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,710
Speaker 1: I don't understand how you did it faster than me, but this does remind me of a very brief anecdote from my high school life.

110
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:37,335
Speaker 1: It was.

111
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,070
Speaker 1: it was just a sublime moment of comedy.

112
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:44,090
Speaker 1: I was playing command and conquer over with a null modem with a friend of mine in the den.

113
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,500
Speaker 1: Like he was on one computer.

114
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,286
Speaker 1: I was the other computer.

115
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:46,910
Speaker 1: We had a null modem.

116
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,816
Speaker 1: We were playing command and conquer kind of seriously.

117
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,747
Speaker 1: the computer he was playing on was of course the worst computer like.

118
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:57,664
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use Your house if I got a Pentium Pro, I'm fucking using it.

119
00:06:57,724 --> 00:06:58,326
Speaker 1: so I'm on that.

120
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,162
Speaker 1: he's on like the 486 Which could play the game?

121
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:14,742
Speaker 1: Okay, like it worked We're playing but there was a problem with that 486 where every now and then not often but like once a month or so The mouse driver would just go insane And if you move the mouse at all It would just go blew it all over and you were just screwed.

122
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,195
Speaker 1: like there was no way to fix that without rebooting.

123
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:18,059
Speaker 0: so happened.

124
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:25,242
Speaker 1: while you're playing we're in the middle of the game and My Competitor suddenly says this is bullshit the mouse broke.

125
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,546
Speaker 1: I can't do anything.

126
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,930
Speaker 1: I can't command.

127
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,575
Speaker 1: That's the whole point of the game.

128
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:35,193
Speaker 1: And all I said was well, I guess your only choice is to conquer Mm-hmm.

129
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:36,817
Speaker 1: That's the extent of my anecdote.

130
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:37,539
Speaker 1: cool story, bro.

131
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,963
Speaker 0: Alright, so next thing.

132
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:45,500
Speaker 0: steam is having a summer Festival where there's like a zillion free game demos and like.

133
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:55,829
Speaker 0: actually it's sort of like a little convention on the steam store Website like you'll see like it's like developer talks like on the front page of the steam store moderately excited about this.

134
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,050
Speaker 0: Yeah.

135
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:06,529
Speaker 0: So if you want to play demos of any of the the games on steam that are on there and there's a lot of games Like I've never seen before it's sort of like got an indie mega booth kind of feel going on.

136
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, but unlike the indie mega booth as much as I love the indie game showcases at conventions, especially like Pax's.

137
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:19,249
Speaker 1: they're usually so crowded and dense that I end up just Taking pictures of the games that look interesting and trying to play them later.

138
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:20,456
Speaker 0: yep, Steve.

139
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,408
Speaker 1: and then I forget and I end up never playing any of them.

140
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:26,079
Speaker 0: and This just tons of tons of free game demos.

141
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,264

149
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:53,450
Speaker 1: I care about it from an academic and industry perspective.

150
00:08:53,612 --> 00:09:09,508
Speaker 1: I also care about it because while you and I are the kinds of people who will drop several thousand dollars than a gaming PC and like That is in many cases the correct decision for a lot of reasons PS 5 is basically a gaming PC that a kid can buy for according to this price leak 500 euros.

151
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,013
Speaker 0: It doesn't do.

152
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,924
Speaker 0: I don't think it's really qualifies as gaming PC, right?

153
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,530
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what kind of games you want.

154
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:23,163
Speaker 0: Oh, for example, it can't play 1700 1700 games that cost five dollars.

155
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,369
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll get to that news.

156
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:31,369
Speaker 1: But uh, but it does the thing about the PlayStation 5. the point I would see through all this is landing to the past randomize.

157
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:36,830
Speaker 1: Since then like the Nintendo switch was one of the it was the only console they came out in recent memory.

158
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,450
Speaker 1: Nintendo tends to do this that actually had something interesting going on with the hardware that made it like notable.

159
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,430
Speaker 0: I mean like you mean like every Nintendo console.

160
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, that made it notable beyond just the exclusive games that had.

161
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:57,033
Speaker 1: but the PlayStation 5 while it is just a console It's basically the last generic big iron Console.

162
00:09:57,274 --> 00:10:01,630
Speaker 1: that isn't just like a gaming PC because I mean a very different direction.

163
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,768
Speaker 0: Someone's buying the X bone and I don't know who it is.

164
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,722
Speaker 1: The next one look like.

165
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,088
Speaker 0: I don't know anyone who has one.

166
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,957
Speaker 0: I just like know it exists But like I don't see like it's like.

167
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:20,530
Speaker 1: it must be like in their own community somewhere like honestly everyone I know either has if they're a gamer at all like video games.

168
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:35,015
Speaker 0: They either have a gaming PC and a switch or they have a PlayStation and a switch Yeah, I don't know anyone who has and the newer Xboxes and I think there's another one coming I don't know anything about.

169
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,349
Speaker 1: I want to know who the person is who has an Xbox and a PlayStation.

170
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,333
Speaker 0: I know more people who pay for the Xbox game pass on PC.

171
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:45,670
Speaker 0: that gets you a whole bunch of Xbox games to play on your right.

172
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,210
Speaker 0: I always like style subscription.

173
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:52,930
Speaker 0: I always know people who have actual Xboxes the Xbox to eventually evolve.

174
00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:03,934
Speaker 1: I've you could listen to geek nights from like the early days and I would say this the future of the Xbox was it's just Microsoft wanted to do.

175
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:10,621
Speaker 0: is they wanted to be like, okay, we'll sell you a box in your house that can play the same PC Games, so if you're not a PC gamer, you can.

176
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:12,630
Speaker 0: we can still sell our PC games.

177
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,453
Speaker 0: Remember when you know.

178
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:19,737
Speaker 0: remember in valve develop the game once for Windows and DirectX and we can sell it to people on console Or on a PC.

179
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:27,430
Speaker 0: that's the original Xbox was about Originally and they just failed to deliver on that and they're getting closer to delivering on it as time goes on.

180
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:31,338
Speaker 1: Partly blame a Failure of vision in that they did.

181
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,204
Speaker 1: it's like a pendulette with the pigeon.

182
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:34,910
Speaker 1: They didn't really want it enough.

183
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,416
Speaker 1: They always made compromises.

184
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:37,842
Speaker 1: They always backed off into.

185
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:39,670
Speaker 1: well, really it is still just a console.

186
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,448
Speaker 1: You can't just play all your games on your gaming PC.

187
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:54,410
Speaker 0: I blame just the reality of hardware and that you know, the video game console works because you sell, you know Slower cheaper hardware that is customized and specific and doesn't have all this other PC stuff happening.

188
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:55,132
Speaker 0: Right.

189
00:11:55,433 --> 00:12:04,049
Speaker 0: and thus you can and developers know that when they're writing the games that they're targeting this one specific hardware platform They know exactly what's on there, right?

190
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:11,090
Speaker 0: So they can really heavily optimize the engines and things for that platform and thus you get higher.

191
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,284
Speaker 0: You know graphics and performance for less money, right?

192
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:17,050
Speaker 0: The thing only costs a few hundred dollars.

193
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game ends up looking like you're playing at a thousand dollar computer.

194
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:24,372
Speaker 0: Whereas and you're not a boy You're running Windows Right.

195
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:28,767
Speaker 0: So you've and you got all this other shit on your computer and you got all this other stuff running.

196
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:34,090
Speaker 0: and it's not You know at the people writing the game have to be prepared for that game to work on any computer anywhere.

197
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:38,790
Speaker 1: All right, he's trying to play with a steam controller and an old Xbox controller.

198
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,673
Speaker 0: He's got this guy.

199
00:12:39,753 --> 00:12:40,295
Speaker 0: I got it.

200
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:45,495
Speaker 0: We got to have this game work whether they've got a GTX 770 or a GTX 10,000 Right.

201
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,677
Speaker 0: This guy's monitor Hard or an Nvidia video?

202
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:54,109
Speaker 1: this guy's this gamers aspect ratio is 15 to 1. what even is that?

203
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,998
Speaker 0: right exactly so You know.

204
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,710
Speaker 0: and so a PC ends up costing more.

205
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:07,283
Speaker 0: So if you wanted to make a game that worked out a PC and a hypothetical Xbox The Xbox would need to be quite powerful like he's in point.

206
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,728
Speaker 1: Look at the old days the NES.

207
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,829
Speaker 1: a Lot of kids don't know what PC games looked like when the NES was out.

208
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:19,930
Speaker 1: Go look at what our PC game looked like contemporary to like Super Mario Brothers.

209
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:22,257
Speaker 0: Well, you can just look at like Commodore 64 games.

210
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:26,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Commodore 64 versions of games are not as good as any as fresh.

211
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:29,622
Speaker 1: That Megaman port is just amazing.

212
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:30,849
Speaker 0: only the audio is good.

213
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:34,691
Speaker 1: But I did find this one article that was sort of funny about the PlayStation 5.

214
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:38,462
Speaker 1: We'll probably talk more about the PlayStation 5 like as internet news comes out about it.

215
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,288
Speaker 1: I mean, it's notable.

216
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:44,696
Speaker 0: It's important, but There's talk about the PlayStation 4 4 was less notable.

217
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:56,740
Speaker 1: But there I saw this great headline when I was looking for the news that literally just says PlayStation 5 Exclusive games are quote more important than ever to.

218
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:00,029
Speaker 0: Sony says yeah, because there's no other reason to buy it.

219
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:09,208
Speaker 0: Yep, because I think that's really what it comes down to is that there are people out there I know who are huge fans of the Sony exclusive games like the spider-man game was an example.

220
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:09,750
Speaker 1: and guess what?

221
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:14,208
Speaker 0: Game I would like to play but I'm not gonna go out of my way to play.

222
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:21,354
Speaker 1: but I hate exclusives that I accept the Nintendo exclusives because they're tied to Exclusive hardware.

223
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,717
Speaker 1: that does something different.

224
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:28,329
Speaker 1: I don't need exclusive generic code that could run on my gaming PC.

225
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,076
Speaker 0: Well, that's the other thing.

226
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:33,230
Speaker 0: Is that a lot of games, you know, the pattern I'm seeing now?

227
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:39,450
Speaker 0: Is it a lot of games that were exclusive right in the in the some, you know past time, right?

228
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:40,783
Speaker 0: No longer.

229
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:47,287
Speaker 0: Yes exclusives right But you know even games like so for example, right?

230
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:51,420
Speaker 0: I remember Journey was like a big exclusive when it came out.

231
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:52,343
Speaker 0: Guess what?

232
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,250
Speaker 0: It's on Steam now, right?

233
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,074
Speaker 0: I think it actually.

234
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,790
Speaker 0: it came out on Steam five days ago, right?

235
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,178
Speaker 0: So that game is pretty old several years old.

236
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,908
Speaker 0: I think right, but I'm not in a rush.

237
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:03,490
Speaker 0: What's my hurry?

238
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have.

239
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,970
Speaker 1: I own thanks to a news that's coming up in a minute.

240
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:10,882
Speaker 1: I own more games than I'm ever going to play ever exactly so.

241
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:19,110
Speaker 0: but yeah journey which was I believe I'm pretty sure it was a PlayStation exclusive game when it came out came out on Steam five days ago.

242
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:22,372
Speaker 0: It's on sale right now for $11.25.

243
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:23,319
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll play that now.

244
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:24,548
Speaker 0: No, it's worth like.

245
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:30,490
Speaker 0: I Thoroughly enjoyed it sure but like I didn't there was no harm done to me by waiting.

246
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:34,246
Speaker 0: The game is not any worse now than it was then, you know, what's my rush right?

247
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,210
Speaker 0: that spider-man game?

248
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,438
Speaker 0: That's exclusive to PlayStation or whatever.

249
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:42,784
Speaker 0: Well five years from five years from now six years from now Maybe I'll play it on PC.

250
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:43,530
Speaker 0: and what's the difference?

251
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,473
Speaker 1: So I got the stats.

252
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:55,449
Speaker 1: of the 28 games that were shown as launch or near launch games for the Sony PlayStation 5 nine of them are from Sony Studios and are permanent exclusives.

253
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,190
Speaker 1: 14 are timed exclusives that will at some point specifically be available on PC.

254
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:08,330
Speaker 0: Yeah So 14, so what are any of those nine games games that I'm gonna like, oh my god, I need to play those.

255
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,294
Speaker 0: I'll pay.

256
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:13,090
Speaker 1: I assume the spider-man one is but I did not actually five hundred dollars.

257
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,744
Speaker 1: I mean the thing is the Nintendo switch was not five hundred dollars.

258
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:20,499
Speaker 1: and then it's also true What's worth the price of admission alone?

259
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,728
Speaker 0: Just well, I'm not and this isn't saying it.

260
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:25,438
Speaker 0: Yes what I'm saying This isn't saying something negative about the spider-man game.

261
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:31,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's saying something about the breath of the wild is like Yeah spider-man game ain't as good as breath though you

262
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:40,919
Speaker 1: got to divide the cost of a console by the total cost of all the exclusive game or the number of Exclusive games to that console to determine if that console is worth it.

263
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:49,390
Speaker 0: and Mario maker and p cross and animal crossing and Pokemon Yeah, all the other Mario games and super the Super Mario Odyssey paper Mario this alright.

264
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,537
Speaker 0: So yeah, let's move on to the next tiny news.

265
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:52,922
Speaker 0: Okay, this is a big news.

266
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:53,664
Speaker 0: There's a new.

267
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:59,498
Speaker 0: there's a new paper Mario That's coming Real soon, I think like in a month from now July.

268
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,406
Speaker 1: I did not see that Origami King.

269
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:03,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, Origami King.

270
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:13,829
Speaker 0: so this Yeah by all you know paper Mario as a whole taking every all you know is hit or miss, right?

271
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:22,825
Speaker 0: But when you take all the Mario RPG ish games, right Mario RPG Mario and Luigi paper Mario Super Mario all these different things together for the most part.

272
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,698
Speaker 0: Those are really good games I've enjoyed most of.

273
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,089
Speaker 0: there have been a few stinkers in there.

274
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:34,359
Speaker 1: I'd say they're like the whole cannon is above average, but that's because there's some really high highs Really low lows.

275
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, but thousand-year door was.

276

277
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:42,510
Speaker 0: if you haven't played thousand-year door for GameCube do that now, there's probably a geek nights episode about it.

278
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:43,185
Speaker 0: It has to be.

279
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 0: but anyway this Origami King by all evidence we have appears to be on The thousand-year door level of paper Mario game.

280
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,746

290
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,169
Speaker 0: They got a lot of problems going on at Wizards of the coast But they did one good thing, you know better late than never.

291
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:25,950
Speaker 0: They went through all of the magic the gathering cards from all of history and they found some racist ones and I was like She's surprised by how many of the racist ones that I recognized and or owned.

292
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:36,408
Speaker 0: Yep, yeah And that's actually somewhat of a credit to them in that if they did in fact find all the racist cards It's really hard to go through every magic card, right?

293
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,786
Speaker 0: You know.

294
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:51,287
Speaker 0: But if they found if those are truly all the racist ones that should be banned and they by the way They did bad them and remove their images and artwork from their website One of them was particularly egregious because its database ID was also racist.

295
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:57,067
Speaker 0: Yes, which could horrible been a coincidence which which they did acknowledge the horrible.

296
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:01,506
Speaker 0: Yeah Coincidence there is zero chance in my mind.

297
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:05,786
Speaker 0: That was a coincidence But the fact that they acknowledge that means that they know it which is good.

298
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,570
Speaker 0: Yep, right but anyway.

299
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:12,415
Speaker 0: But yeah They they banned those cards as hard as any Card could be banned.

300
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:24,368
Speaker 0: and if those indeed are all the ones that should be banned for this reason That I think is actually a credit to them and that it's seems to have been a very long time since they've made a racist Card so they've been doing somewhat of a good job.

301
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:31,110
Speaker 0: It's not like there were any cards I believe like in the brand new sets that were yeah that needed to be banned.

302
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,351
Speaker 0: Right.

303
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,155
Speaker 0: These are old cards.

304
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:37,351
Speaker 1: I mean granted my knowledge of the Magic Cannon Peters out around Alliance.

305
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:41,610
Speaker 0: yes, I'm just saying I was very surprised by how many of those cards I recognized and or owned.

306
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:42,992
Speaker 1: Yep.

307
00:19:43,193 --> 00:19:44,158
Speaker 1: Well part of that was cuz like.

308
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,350
Speaker 1: most of my cards are from the oldest sets.

309
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,914
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

310
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:48,858
Speaker 0: I mean my cards are from.

311
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,610
Speaker 0: I actually looked up when they put out that magic anniversary timeline.

312
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,096
Speaker 0: It's like wow, I played Magic the Gathering from like 1993 through 1990.

313
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,763
Speaker 0: I played it for a very short time.

314
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:08,870
Speaker 0: Yep, like two to three years like 1996 it was like a little after 96 But then it was like a two and a half year very brief period where I played Magic the Gathering and bought Magic cards.

315
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,375
Speaker 0: And that was it.

316
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:10,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought it felt like much longer.

317
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,363
Speaker 0: It felt like that was a major part of my childhood, but it wasn't.

318
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:14,570
Speaker 0: it was just two and a half years.

319
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like basically it was middle school.

320
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:28,403
Speaker 1: So in a very positive news or up on the opposite side of that there was a bundle for racial justice and equality On itch IO if you're not aware everyone everyone knows about this by now.

321
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:29,507
Speaker 1: gotta make sure everybody.

322
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:40,710
Speaker 1: I got a. so It raised eight over eight million dollars Mm-hmm, and anyone who bought it got basically an infinite number of indie games, right?

323
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:46,530
Speaker 0: So it started out with like, you know a smaller number of games But game developers just kept adding their games to it.

324
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,331
Speaker 0: Like yeah put my stuff in the bundle and then itch IO would check out their stuff and say okay that can go in the Bundle.

325
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:57,530
Speaker 0: in it goes and the bundle got bigger and the money got bigger and it's like you pay five bucks minimum.

326
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,399
Speaker 0: I think it's over now.

327
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,570
Speaker 0: I don't think you can buy it anymore.

328
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,263
Speaker 1: It ended rod it ended today a few.

329
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:08,430
Speaker 0: I had to like 3 a.m But like everyone bought it already right and anyone listening to this already bought this.

330
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:09,682
Speaker 1: I hope you did.

331
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:12,490
Speaker 1: if you didn't yeah Well, we're gonna be over time.

332
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,806
Speaker 1: You're gonna see a lot of people reviewing a lot of really tiny.

333
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:18,469
Speaker 0: in the ends A lot of the things in the bundle are not necessarily games.

334
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:30,235
Speaker 0: For example, one thing I saw in there was just sort of a piece of software that let you procedurally build a tower of bricks in 3d and then Throw balls at it at.

335
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:35,090
Speaker 0: you know, it's like a physics simulation engine and then watch watch the tower collapse.

336
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:35,581
Speaker 0: It was fun.

337
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,465
Speaker 0: It was fun for like 10 minutes.

338
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was pretty great.

339
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:48,029
Speaker 0: And you know, I was pretty happy with that, but it's not exactly necessarily, you know Like a game kind of right, you know, well, you know what it is.

340
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,520
Speaker 1: We've talked about this quite a bit in our panels over the years.

341
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,044
Speaker 0: It's like a software experience.

342
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:55,230
Speaker 1: This is all entertainment software.

343
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly, well you enter there also.

344
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,379
Speaker 1: was it software?

345
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,875
Speaker 0: there's also quite a large number of the items in the bundle are Software to help you.

346
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:08,786
Speaker 0: there was like I saw like a management like dragon.

347
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:11,660
Speaker 1: pixel art tile set Here's just a really big are a lot.

348
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:13,750
Speaker 0: There are a lot of pixel art tile sets.

349
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:20,649
Speaker 0: So if you are looking to make a game and you don't want to make art You're just want to use like RPG maker and make a game.

350
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:24,419
Speaker 0: This is like the mother lode because you have now a dragon.

351
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,441
Speaker 1: I'm just scrolling through.

352
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,747
Speaker 1: this is a full 2d game engine.

353
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:31,537
Speaker 1: Yep Form tiny hot loaded.

354
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's all kinds of crazy stuff in there.

355
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:40,870
Speaker 0: And yeah, if you buy it if you have this you probably don't need to buy any video games whatsoever for several years.

356
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,478
Speaker 1: Yeah at this point.

357
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:42,839
Speaker 1: Let's see.

358
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:44,066
Speaker 1: How many total games are it?

359
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:46,775
Speaker 1: So there are 1391 things in this.

360
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:49,146
Speaker 1: if I add that to my steam library, I own like 4,000 things.

361
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,421
Speaker 1: Yep, you know my steam library is terrifying.

362
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:55,845
Speaker 1: not I did not buy all those games.

363
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,210
Speaker 1: It's terrifying for other reasons.

364
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:01,818
Speaker 1: So, uh in some other big news.

365
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:08,082
Speaker 1: as you suspected a lot of conventions are not happening and PAX has actually announced their plan.

366
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,959
Speaker 1: they have Deferred pegs Australia to 2021 or to 2020.

367
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:13,310
Speaker 1: Yeah 2021.

368
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:19,251
Speaker 0: So it's hard to know when he packs us trip, so they're not gonna have two packs Australia's in 2021.

369
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:22,973
Speaker 0: They're just gonna cancel 2020 and have yeah 21.

370
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:27,769
Speaker 1: obviously packs West clearly is not gonna happen and instead there is going to be packs online.

371
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,782
Speaker 1: Now the cool thing is they're doing it in an interesting way.

372
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:33,106
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of details yet.

373
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,430
Speaker 1: This is like breaking news.

374
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:39,322
Speaker 1: now It's going to be 24/9 meaning.

375
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:41,973
Speaker 1: It's going to be nine days 24/7.

376
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:52,910
Speaker 1: well 24/9 from September 12th through September 20th And they have promised that there will be content rolling at all hours of the day during this experience.

377
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:55,167
Speaker 0: Right, so they're gonna get you know.

378
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,581
Speaker 1: There's gonna be live stream panels Pre-recorded panels eSports stuff.

379
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,950
Speaker 1: They're trying to figure out what to do with an expo haul.

380
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:05,718
Speaker 1: There's gonna be like panel submissions are open.

381
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:09,390
Speaker 1: They're trying to set up a community thing tournament aggregation systems.

382
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:14,950
Speaker 1: There's a lot of biz and we just have to wait for the details because we don't know any more than you do at this point.

383
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:23,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I do know however is that If you are someone like me who buys packs t-shirts, right?

384
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:30,470
Speaker 0: They obviously you know because the way the world works the they design all the packs merch each year and put in orders in advance.

385
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:40,898
Speaker 0: So the packs West and awesome merch was already ordered And probably in a warehouse somewhere and now they have to sell that off But they're not gonna have a packs to sell it at.

386
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,510
Speaker 0: so they are in the penny arcade shop website.

387
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:46,682
Speaker 0: They are selling all the packs West exclusive merch.

388
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,670
Speaker 1: They call it like the penny arcade garage sale.

389
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:49,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, all that.

390
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:50,820
Speaker 0: Well, no, that was it.

391
00:24:50,900 --> 00:25:01,310
Speaker 0: They were having a general sale on penny arcade Store in you know, just in general like like for the past week or so and it that now it seems suspicious.

392
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,344
Speaker 0: Maybe they were trying to clear up warehouse space for the pack stuff.

393
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:05,469
Speaker 1: No, that could make sense.

394
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:10,287
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm just guessing but yet all packs West stuff is pre.

395
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:27,050
Speaker 0: all the pracs West Merch and packs Explorer merch that usually is packs exclusive is pre-order on the penny arcade shop and the packs oss merch is coming a week from now and Presumably there will be packs online merch that they're gonna make out of nothing.

396
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:33,410
Speaker 1: I hope they do because packs online every packs has a color packs online has got the coveted green spot.

397
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:34,740
Speaker 0: It's sort of.

398
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:36,050
Speaker 1: it's too light.

399
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:38,299
Speaker 1: It's too close to the packs dev color to be honest.

400
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,850
Speaker 1: and there will I expect like we'll see what happens.

401
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:41,834
Speaker 1: They should have gone.

402
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:46,913
Speaker 0: see I don't know why they don't go with green like freakin, you know, Koopa shell green That's the green.

403
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:47,939
Speaker 0: I'm talking about.

404
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:51,230
Speaker 1: I like a good 2380 23.

405
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway But we'll see.

406
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:56,503
Speaker 0: you are someone who's never accept our panels.

407
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,030
Speaker 1: We're gonna do stuff at this packs.

408
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,450
Speaker 1: I'm breaking to take days off work and just like packs it up depending on exactly how this goes.

409
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:03,574
Speaker 0: We'll see how it goes.

410
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:04,477
Speaker 1: Where else am I gonna go?

411
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:07,929
Speaker 1: Like I those vacation days are already earmarked for paxes.

412
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,830
Speaker 0: I'm having real trouble finding ways to use the vacation days.

413
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,108
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, you know staying home and doing a digital packs might be you might end up being the only way.

414
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:22,642
Speaker 1: Yep, and You we can promise if our panels or our content is at this packs online.

415
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:25,330
Speaker 1: We will have the highest quality and fidelity.

416
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,569
Speaker 0: We'll probably go to Scott anyone out there and who actually listens to the show all three of you.

417
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:36,478
Speaker 0: If You want to Do an online convention, right?

418
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,762
Speaker 0: Because we could do that very easily.

419
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:42,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, right we could stay home use dirt in vacation days.

420
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:52,175
Speaker 0: all of us agree to do this during the online packs and basically create on our discord server like a Unofficial packs room.

421
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,583
Speaker 1: It's like the geek nights room during packs.

422
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:56,350
Speaker 1: It's like it's like the place in tabletop.

423
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:07,731
Speaker 0: We may or may not be officially associated with packs, but we can all agree that during the online packs we all take days off all go to the discord all day and Play.

424
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,617
Speaker 0: we could play RPGs, right?

425
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:11,041
Speaker 0: We got other kinds of games.

426
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:11,923
Speaker 0: You just hang out.

427
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:12,364
Speaker 0: we could.

428
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:14,330
Speaker 0: we could do a panels, right?

429
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,616
Speaker 0: We could do Q&A's with.

430
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,089
Speaker 1: we could attend other panels and make fun of them.

431
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:25,710
Speaker 0: Yeah You out there listening can submit panels to do on our discord for us and we'll watch your panel, right?

432
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:32,830
Speaker 1: This reeks of an ancient past where we basically stole a panel room from kinetic on before we took over, right?

433
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,018
Speaker 0: But this is just virtual.

434
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:34,864
Speaker 0: we're basically.

435
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:36,733
Speaker 0: we're basically Manufacturing up.

436
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:40,770

00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:40,830
Speaker 0: So it should be much easier to play now, but and it's gonna be on steam.

458
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:51,680
Speaker 1: But yeah for and last and least but also not least there is a fantastic Game that's been on steam for a while and then eventually made it to the switch Which I still think is the best form factor for it.

459
00:28:52,222 --> 00:28:53,308
Speaker 1: It is now on iOS.

460
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,499
Speaker 1: You can play it on your tablets and your iPhone.

461
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,390
Speaker 0: I've been wait been waiting so long.

Speaker 0: Slay the slayer.

463
00:28:58,754 --> 00:28:59,396
Speaker 0: slay the spire.

464
00:28:59,516 --> 00:28:59,897
Speaker 0: iOS.

465
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,522
Speaker 0: the iPad one is the best one.

466
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:04,070
Speaker 1: This game is such a good fucking game.

467
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,757
Speaker 1: I can I can now you enough.

468
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:08,690
Speaker 0: I can play slay the spire on my iPhone or iPad.

469
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:15,128
Speaker 0: That means when if I ever go back to work I can live the dream and play slay the spire on the toilet at work.

470
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:21,450
Speaker 1: Yep I don't do that with your ascension while I'm pooping but I could beat one floor while I'm can't do that with your switch.

471
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:23,936
Speaker 1: I mean I could.

472
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:28,111
Speaker 0: and now I can play the slay the spire on the subway to work without having to bring a switch to Work.

473
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,075
Speaker 1: slay the spire.

474
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:29,618
Speaker 1: It's just we've.

475
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:31,567
Speaker 1: I think we reviewed it at one point in the past.

476
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:37,928
Speaker 1: this game So good single-player is the game generated deck builder slay the spire like.

477
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:38,470
Speaker 1: that's the game.

478
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:45,610
Speaker 0: It's me, you know, it's made by people from the netrunner community back in the day all you know five years ago.

479
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:54,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I had to sell you on it The one thing I would say is that you know how in a deck building game like Dominion Like a balance problem might ruin your game like you have to worry about that.

480
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,238
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter in a single-player game.

481
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:00,910
Speaker 1: So this is a game where you might just figure out an infinite combo.

482
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,492
Speaker 1: You know what?

483
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:02,394
Speaker 1: Awesome.

484
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:05,062
Speaker 1: The game is totally single-player single-player.

485
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:05,443
Speaker 0: Who cares?

486
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you get over power, who are you cheating?

487
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,010
Speaker 0: the spire?

488
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:13,296
Speaker 0: Oh The spire has been cheated.

489
00:30:13,698 --> 00:30:15,629
Speaker 1: I should find that penny arcade and link to it.

490
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,917
Speaker 0: I've I've I've found it many.

491
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:19,664
Speaker 0: it was it was actually not the comic.

492
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:20,949
Speaker 0: it was it was the text.

493
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:21,895
Speaker 1: Yes It was the text.

494
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:22,921
Speaker 1: I remember we figured that out.

495
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,129
Speaker 1: He wanted to put it in a panel.

496
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tycho was talking about Jerry.

497
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,486
Speaker 0: Tycho was talking about people cheating at Diablo and he's like.

498
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:30,710
Speaker 1: who's like cheated?

499
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:31,454
Speaker 0: He's right.

500
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:32,279
Speaker 0: who is right?

501
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:34,289
Speaker 0: It's like who is the cheated party the devil?

502
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:36,329
Speaker 0: It's like.

503
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:38,878
Speaker 0: It's like you can't cheat a job.

504
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:49,725
Speaker 0: Okay, it's not like you're cheating your friend Satan the devil Things of the day.

505
00:30:50,408 --> 00:30:52,415
Speaker 1: This is so weird that I had to link to it.

506
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:53,720
Speaker 1: I did not know this was the thing.

507
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,218
Speaker 1: I'd never encountered this in my life.

508
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:59,475
Speaker 1: So the first thing I saw about this was a channel I follow.

509
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:12,096
Speaker 1: Adam Neely like good music stuff but it talked about testing and potentially debunking the 432 Hertz frequencies and temperaments and all I could think was what what like what like that?

510
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:14,564
Speaker 1: I know music I know audio.

511
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:20,307
Speaker 1: that didn't make any sense to me and I don't know what you just said and this is a person Who knows about music.

512
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:23,039
Speaker 1: so I was confused enough to where I watch this video.

513
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:41,518
Speaker 1: Apparently, I don't know when this started there is some Ridiculous wackadoodle woo-woo out there of people who don't know anything about anything Believing that normal music is based on 440 Hertz which will damage your brain in some way.

514
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,230
Speaker 1: but 432 Hertz that's the magic node.

515
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,580
Speaker 1: That'll make you smarter and better and cure your cancer.

516
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,806
Speaker 1: Okay, like.

517
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:56,187
Speaker 0: it's not only that I could play those two notes Out of like a speaker, right?

518
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,151
Speaker 0: I just make a wav file.

519
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:57,994
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

520
00:31:58,134 --> 00:31:59,800
Speaker 1: No, this is so many for you.

521
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:04,080
Speaker 0: It's only 8 Hertz apart, there was no way you could tell the difference in design.

522
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,847
Speaker 1: so the argument is not that.

523
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:10,926
Speaker 1: the argument is that we tune the key of a to 440 Hertz because that's the standard.

524
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:18,752
Speaker 1: but if you tune a down to 432 and play your music there It'll harmonize with the universe and do all this magic nonsense.

525
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:20,257
Speaker 0: You would never be able to tell.

526
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:24,675
Speaker 1: so apparently There's all these scam apps that will just like detune MP3s.

527
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:25,800
Speaker 1: You're playing on your phone.

528
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:27,385
Speaker 0: Is the app?

529
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:30,460
Speaker 0: you pay me money and I put an icon on your phone and it does nothing.

530
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,233
Speaker 1: The icon actually just makes all your detunes your music.

531
00:32:35,176 --> 00:32:35,878
Speaker 0: It actually works.

532
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:38,038
Speaker 0: Well, yeah It just doesn't just do nothing.

533
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:41,331
Speaker 1: Some of them probably do nothing but some of them definitely bring.

534
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:44,948
Speaker 1: they just detune they bring your music lower Which that's a trivial.

535
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:47,708
Speaker 0: if I was if I was gonna scam Conspiracy nuts.

536
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,098
Speaker 0: I would just make an app that does nothing.

537
00:32:49,158 --> 00:33:04,033
Speaker 1: Yep But this video is great because it it doesn't worry about the wackadoodle nonsense so much But it debunks how even if the wackadoodle nonsense were true It still doesn't actually work like the concept does not work.

538
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:07,683
Speaker 1: Even if all the magic nonsense were somehow real Mm-hmm.

539
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:11,260
Speaker 1: It's just a really good debunking that I enjoyed quite a bit.

540
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:19,293
Speaker 1: I'd encourage you to not in any way try to look up the actual 432 Hertz stuff because it is so crazy.

541
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:21,299
Speaker 1: I cannot stress how crazy it is.

542
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:23,588
Speaker 0: So what are you guys honey?

543
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:23,850
Speaker 0: Crazy?

544
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:33,504
Speaker 0: It's not a crazier than flat earth It's more in-depth than flat earth anyway, so NARS go can bet.

545
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:39,660
Speaker 0: there is a convention called narrow scope and Nara scope is a convention about narrative games, right?

546
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,379
Speaker 0: You know everything from like a text adventure to a game with a bunch of cutscenes, you know story games But video story games primarily, right?

547
00:33:48,522 --> 00:33:49,144
Speaker 0: And that's pretty cool.

548
00:33:49,164 --> 00:33:50,048
Speaker 0: It's a cool convention.

549
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:51,674
Speaker 0: It's been going on for quite a few years.

550
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:56,594
Speaker 0: I approve of it Although I'm not deep enough into that scene to attend it or speak at it.

551
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:59,958
Speaker 0: Definitely or I am not a Writer of any kind, right?

552
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:07,320
Speaker 0: And obviously narrow scope like all conventions had to go online this year and that was between June.

553
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,067
Speaker 0: It was like late May early June.

554
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:25,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were doing all sorts of streams and they put all their stuff on YouTube and whatnot and the keynote speaker of narrow scope 2020 happened to be someone I'm a big fan of Zalavir Nelson who is doing the game.

555
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:33,275
Speaker 0: I pretty sure I previously mentioned on geek nights at least one or two times An airport for aliens currently run by dogs.

556
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:33,556
Speaker 0: Yep.

557
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:33,777
Speaker 1: Yep.

558
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:41,771
Speaker 0: Yeah As well as many other things He has worked on And his keynote.

559
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,159
Speaker 0: I went and watched it, right?

560
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,820
Speaker 0: It's like you look at the quality of this keynote, right?

561
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:59,209
Speaker 0: and it's basically you're looking at 16 by 9 box and on the bottom of it is a narrow scope logo and Inside that is a 4 by 3 box or 6 maybe a 16. that's 16 by 10 It doesn't matter.

562
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:07,243
Speaker 0: and in that box You're looking at a screen capture of what appears to be like a Google Hangout or a zoom or something Or a sky.

563
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:09,108
Speaker 0: it might be a Skype actually, I can't tell.

564
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,512
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter.

565
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:17,799
Speaker 0: and on the left side is like the slide He's showing from his computer and on the right side is a tiny picture of him.

566
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:25,460
Speaker 0: Some webcam pointed at his face, right and it's like this it looks like a ramshackle kind of keynote, right?

567
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:37,260
Speaker 0: the keynote he gave for narrow scope 2020 is easily Five times as good as any packs keynote ever He's like does not even close, right?

568
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:49,739
Speaker 0: so if you're someone who cares about narrative games, right video games with storytelling going on or or Tabletop RPGs also right with you know storytelling going out.

569
00:35:49,779 --> 00:36:05,439
Speaker 0: Yeah Or you just want to hear awesome game keynotes or you're interested in the work of the amazing Zalavir who is whose output is insane And pretty much gonna play everything he's ever made including all the ones I missed.

570
00:36:06,882 --> 00:36:09,434
Speaker 0: You need to watch this keynote, even though it's 90 minutes.

571
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:13,146
Speaker 0: you could not Find a better way.

572
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:15,980
Speaker 0: It would be hard to find a better way to spend 90 minutes easily.

573
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,850
Speaker 0: I'm much better use of your time to listen to a geek night.

574
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, right like why even listen to a geek nights?

575
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:23,636
Speaker 0: Just go watch this instead.

576
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,290
Speaker 0: Alright, so met a moment.

577
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:28,780
Speaker 1: We're not really reading right now.

578
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,099
Speaker 1: We're not really doing a lot except like clearing our task lists and playing video games and trying to make that see book club.

579
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:39,546
Speaker 0: book is still Theoretically the tale of Genji.

580
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:40,008
Speaker 1: Yep.

581
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:40,652
Speaker 1: Not Hanzo.

582
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:53,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a Way way back when I decided to make this, you know the ill-fated time, but I decided to make this the book club selection Part of the influence, you know, I was already thinking about making it the book club selection.

583
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,669
Speaker 0: I think I told the story before but I'll repeat it.

584
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:58,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, I was thinking about making it the book club.

585
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:10,920
Speaker 0: it was like on my mind and then I found out that the Met had a whole exhibit about it and on the final day I found out about the exhibit and I went over there on the final day of the exhibit to go see the exhibit.

586
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:15,199
Speaker 0: And you know how museum exhibits always have like a book that they try to sell you.

587
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:19,896
Speaker 0: That's like a big expensive coffee table book full of pictures and descriptions of everything in there.

588
00:37:19,956 --> 00:37:28,926
Speaker 0: right like really in-depth Sort of like letting you take the exhibit home with you in paper form as much as possible for a large amount of money To make profits for the museum.

589
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:32,438
Speaker 0: and you know how museums right now are closed and no one's there.

590
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:36,578
Speaker 0: So it just so happens that the Met is selling that book.

591
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:39,670
Speaker 0: Normally you would have to like go to the Met gift shop to get.

592
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:44,430
Speaker 0: you could just buy that book online from that exhibit Because that exhibit is long gone.

593
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,497
Speaker 0: I went there on the final day.

594
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:47,544
Speaker 0: But yeah, you can.

595
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:56,640
Speaker 0: you can relive that exhibit in a book form coffee table book form Because they're selling the book now for probably I imagine a very large price at least 50 bucks, right?

596
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,968
Speaker 0: But go to the Mets website.

597
00:37:57,988 --> 00:37:59,034
Speaker 0: I'm sure you'll find it there somewhere.

598
00:37:59,054 --> 00:37:59,538
Speaker 0: I don't have a link.

599
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:02,120
Speaker 0: I just saw a tweet saying that they're selling the book.

600
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:07,099
Speaker 1: But we will read this book once the world opens up again and we have opportunities to read.

601
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:12,433
Speaker 1: but Honestly, both of us are busier now than we are like when the world is open.

602
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:14,939
Speaker 0: So I've just I've just become unbusy.

603
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,667
Speaker 1: No Unbusy enough to read.

604
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,337
Speaker 1: or are you gonna get into the deeper hopper?

605
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:20,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

606
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:23,189
Speaker 1: We got projects going we got things things.

607
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,316
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about lest we shit-talk them.

608
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:26,837
Speaker 0: That's right Yeah.

609
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,729
Speaker 1: So all that stuff find us on the internet.

610
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:32,396
Speaker 1: join our discord hang out with us.

611
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:33,460
Speaker 1: check out the YouTube channel.

612
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:38,560
Speaker 1: The last thing I'll say is that uh, you know, we have that geek nice presents YouTube playlist.

613
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,600
Speaker 1: That's basically all our board game reviews without the rest of the geek nights episode.

614
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,994
Speaker 1: So you can just hear like a review of a board game without having to listen to like.

615
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:57,304
Speaker 1: I was talk about our bikes for 20 Minutes, so those have been moderately popular and I think it's a good way to like get the reviews out without the weird Context of what we're rimming Scott like on about in 2006.

616
00:38:57,304 --> 00:39:00,260
Speaker 1: I just want to find out what tigers new freddy's is a good game.

617
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:05,696
Speaker 1: So I started doing the same thing for every anime review we've ever done.

618
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,571
Speaker 1: I made a pipeline.

619
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:10,167
Speaker 1: I Put together like 10 of these videos.

620
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:10,869
Speaker 1: They're all uploaded.

621
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,939
Speaker 1: They're gonna trickle out like every few days for the foreseeable future.

622
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:22,802
Speaker 1: and all I want to say is that looking back at the archive we reviewed a lot of Anime.

623
00:39:23,283 --> 00:39:24,647
Speaker 1: good lord.

624
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:29,440
Speaker 1: I think geek nights Wednesdays by themselves are the longest-running anime podcast on earth.

625
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:34,993
Speaker 1: terms of number of episodes good God No, maybe who knows.

626
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:41,563
Speaker 1: so uh Well, I got to figure out a pipeline to deal with those old ones where the audio quality is not so great because they're good Reviews.

627
00:39:41,624 --> 00:39:42,571
Speaker 1: just we were young.

628
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:45,740
Speaker 1: it was 2005.

629
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,045
Speaker 1: So are you actually?

630
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:51,120
Speaker 0: are you actually listening to those to make sure we don't say anything stupid before you upload them to YouTube?

631
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:56,140
Speaker 1: I do because they're not that long and I also add I put images in them like from the shows.

632
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:59,659
Speaker 1: If we say something stupid, it's buried somewhere in there.

633
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:03,920
Speaker 1: Okay, most of the stupid things we would say are probably in the news or in the opening bits.

634
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:06,072
Speaker 0: So I just want to do a say.

635
00:40:06,093 --> 00:40:08,223
Speaker 0: we're still in the meta moment here I had.

636
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:22,083
Speaker 0: I was told I was listening to a sports podcast and they talked about another sports podcast And the fit and the other sports podcast they were talking about Was a long-running one and that long-running one They.

637
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:26,540
Speaker 0: what they did on their anniversary is they played their very first episode.

638
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:31,923
Speaker 1: Oh, we got a living at first and they talked and Commentaried.

639
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:34,600
Speaker 0: it was like it was like a podcast on a podcast.

640
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:40,000
Speaker 0: I don't know how we could do that because I thought I did that for all the beta episodes of geek nights.

641
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,211
Speaker 0: They're all talking on top of ourselves might be impossible to hear.

642
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:49,627
Speaker 1: Uh, there's oh, I know how I would do it by Consider some auto ducking.

643
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,458
Speaker 1: there's a way to make that work like it could have.

644
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:53,940
Speaker 0: yeah I don't know if we actually want to do that.

645
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,059
Speaker 1: I'm just saying someone else interested in doing it.

646
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,768
Speaker 1: But we're not doing that with this live stream.

647
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,420
Speaker 1: that has to be in person or I'm not even gonna try to make that work.

648
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:05,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess we could like pause ourselves and talk and then unpause.

649
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,204
Speaker 1: I got I could.

650
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,152
Speaker 1: I can envision a pipeline where that would work.

651
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:12,088
Speaker 1: when I did that for all our beta episodes Which is all they're all free.

652
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:20,520
Speaker 1: like you can listen to this crap on the patreon I'd recorded my own like half-hour commentary on each one of those episodes of like the fuck were we on about?

653
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,880
Speaker 0: I think the other thing is, you know It's like we might want to do it where we only do commentary the first few minutes and not the whole right.

654
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:28,818
Speaker 0: But I don't know Park style.

655
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:36,100
Speaker 0: Yeah But we had to still understand the whole episode before we can once once we can get together in the studio again.

656
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,075
Speaker 1: That's something I would like to try to do because I can make the pipeline work.

657
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:39,960
Speaker 1: That is not hard to do.

658
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,579
Speaker 0: It's so meta though, someone already has to care about getting nice to care about that.

659
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,653
Speaker 1: There's people out there not not not a fan, but it could be.

660
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,200
Speaker 1: we could do it for ourselves.

661
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,860
Speaker 1: It could just be transformative and illustrative to us anyway.

662
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:55,350
Speaker 0: So let's move to the main bit.

663
00:41:55,371 --> 00:42:05,336
Speaker 1: finally something that died Something that one of my favorite games ever in the history of gaming of all these games We talked about all these board games that we love all these video games.

664
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:05,979
Speaker 1: breath of the wild.

665
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:14,180
Speaker 1: Tie fighter on the PC from 1994 Remains one of my like top five video games I've ever played.

666
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,972
Speaker 0: I do not play it as much but there is no.

667
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:18,640
Speaker 1: I like perfect tie fighter.

668
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:22,797
Speaker 0: Tie fighter is an amazing game and x-wing ain't bad and x-wing first.

669
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:23,580
Speaker 0: tie fighter ain't bad.

670
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,615
Speaker 1: X-wing tie fighter was bad.

671
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:31,332
Speaker 1: x-wing Had all right everything that x-wing verse tie fighter had but it worked.

672
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:34,840
Speaker 1: it didn't crash and the single-player was good like really good.

673
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:36,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, just not as good as tie fighter.

674
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:43,190
Speaker 0: the point is there was a series of Star Wars free space shooter games in the DOS Windows 95 era.

675
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:50,097
Speaker 0: That were some of the best games because what nerd fantasy is greater than fly x-wing?

676
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,087
Speaker 0: shoot yep But these games fly tie fighter.

677
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:57,340
Speaker 1: the thing about these games the free space shooters in general like that genre of gaming.

678
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,993
Speaker 1: There really were two kinds.

679
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:05,277
Speaker 1: one kind was Really facile free space shooters that were kind of railroady or minimal or like they weren't that good.

680
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:10,340
Speaker 0: and then game thing That's to say our rail shooter isn't really the same job true cuz they're near not in free space.

681
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,659
Speaker 1: Even if you can look around in free space you can't move around.

682
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,389
Speaker 0: You know control you have to be in the free space shooter genre.

683
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,234
Speaker 0: it has to be right.

684
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:26,215
Speaker 0: a first-person camera now Be you're in space right which means you know you're not.

685
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:30,654
Speaker 0: you're not flying a plane in the air Right which always has to be going forward to maintain lift.

686
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:31,880
Speaker 0: right you're in outer space.

687
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,440
Speaker 0: So this there might be gravity pulling you somewhere, but you could nominally move in all directions.

688
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:40,891
Speaker 0: Right you can sit still you could rotate in place.

689
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,677
Speaker 0: You could do barrel roll in place.

690
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:48,433
Speaker 0: You could you know Flip over backwards right you could do all sorts of ridiculous maneuvers.

691
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:54,892
Speaker 0: and the final thing it needs is That the weaponry because you're shooting right is.

692
00:43:54,932 --> 00:44:01,350
Speaker 0: the weaponry in the game Cannot be like in counter-strike where you click on someone right.

693
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:08,069
Speaker 0: it has to be like tribes where it's like a spin fuser that moves And you need to get your enemy to hit it right.

694
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:11,640
Speaker 0: you need to lead them or right in some way.

695
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:13,868
Speaker 0: You know the bullets aren't just like instant.

696
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:15,895
Speaker 0: You know hit scan right.

697
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:16,758
Speaker 0: did I click on them?

698
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:17,279
Speaker 0: they get hit.

699
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:25,500
Speaker 1: no That's not how it works Yeah, but has to almost simulate like dogfighting like planes, but without the constraints of gravity or the ground necessarily.

700
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:35,673
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm though these are very similar to like plane simulators in a lot of ways like very similar mechanics very similar play style depending depending on the game.

701
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:41,192
Speaker 1: because of course like if Descent counts descent is a very different experience from.

702
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:41,974
Speaker 1: so the difference.

703
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,118
Speaker 0: so the thing with descent.

704
00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:43,499
Speaker 0: right.

705
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,009
Speaker 0: well There's descent and descent free space or so descent free space is clearly just free space shooter.

706
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:55,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Descent one two and three are Different in that there's not a lot of gravity going on.

707
00:44:55,602 --> 00:44:56,545
Speaker 1: I mean they're free space.

708
00:44:56,665 --> 00:44:58,531
Speaker 0: FPS is almost right Is it?

709
00:44:58,712 --> 00:44:59,415
Speaker 0: is that you're?

710
00:44:59,475 --> 00:44:59,977
Speaker 0: you're also.

711
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:00,861
Speaker 0: I actually played descent.

712
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:04,432
Speaker 0: the most of any free space kind of game There's.

713
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,669
Speaker 0: there's no gravity really to speak of.

714
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,058
Speaker 0: the Weapons are still just like I said.

715
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:14,070
Speaker 0: you know they you have to sort of you know make sure they hit the enemy.

716
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:15,320
Speaker 0: They're not hit scan or anything.

717
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,200
Speaker 0: you can move in all directions But there's not really a ton of like momentum in descent.

718
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:20,641
Speaker 0: right?

719
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:21,082
Speaker 0: you don't like.

720
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:23,589
Speaker 0: you won't drift in space really right?

721
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:24,378
Speaker 0: you like You'll stop.

722
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:26,817
Speaker 1: well Tyler you didn't really drift either.

723
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:27,640
Speaker 1: you had you.

724
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:29,407
Speaker 1: if you turn the engines on you would move forward.

725
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:29,929
Speaker 1: you turn them off.

726
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:30,616
Speaker 1: you just Sat there.

727
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,549
Speaker 1: there was no drifting.

728
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:36,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the other thing in descent is that you were indoors most of the time.

729
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, right There was some descent.

730
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:41,124
Speaker 0: three had some outdoor action, but it was mostly indoors.

731
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:42,930
Speaker 0: so you were navigating these mines.

732
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:44,470
Speaker 0: Right so you're free.

733
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,815
Speaker 0: You're like.

734
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:45,749
Speaker 0: it's like it's a man.

735
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:50,550
Speaker 0: It's sort of like in Star Wars when you know they you take your x-wing and you go into the Death Star.

736
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:51,393
Speaker 0: All right, you're in it.

737
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:52,979
Speaker 0: That's suddenly descent.

738
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,645
Speaker 0: right you're no longer out in space.

739
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,090
Speaker 0: You're confined by these walls.

740
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:04,578
Speaker 0: You're trying to not hit and you would get damaged if sometimes if you smashed into the walls really hard, so But I guess descent is good stuff like.

741
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:14,457
Speaker 1: I don't want to try to get into a deep analysis of the genre Right now partly because we went super long and everything else and we could talk about this for and I haven't played That much of the genre right.

742
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:19,056
Speaker 0: I've played like you know the seminal games free space descent TIE fighter Wing commander.

743
00:46:19,097 --> 00:46:19,619
Speaker 0: I think counts.

744
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,810
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was good and count you know.

745
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,545
Speaker 1: But I guess what I would want to focus on is what did we like about these games like?

746
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:26,730
Speaker 1: what were the nuggets that these?

747
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:46,970
Speaker 0: Games had that we're not really getting from current genre games or just gaming in general because I think Obviously the number one thing about these games is like compared to other Genres is that you really get that role-playing true simulation fantasy thing going on.

748
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:52,270
Speaker 1: Yeah Like that feeling of I'm gonna get into a mech and hit a bunch of buttons and control everything.

749
00:46:52,732 --> 00:46:58,150
Speaker 0: Right when you play counter-strike you do not feel like you are a terrorists or a counter-terror.

750
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,441
Speaker 1: Yep, I feel like I'm really good at that Mario fly swatting.

751
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:04,150
Speaker 0: I'm just trying to win at counter-strike.

752
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:10,329
Speaker 0: When I play tribes I don't even feel like I'm some tribe member whatever they are.

753
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:14,246
Speaker 0: I'm a guy in my in my room trying to win it.

754
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:22,810
Speaker 1: try these games Honestly like for me as much as I am all about competitive gaming and how I do really want competitive free-space shooters.

755
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:27,061
Speaker 1: What I liked about these games was actually primarily the single-player experience.

756
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:30,710
Speaker 1: It was your soldier in this tie fighter.

757
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,776
Speaker 1: There's like intrigues.

758
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:33,237
Speaker 1: you get.

759
00:47:33,338 --> 00:47:34,381
Speaker 1: mission briefings like.

760
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:40,402
Speaker 1: that was what really sold it to me the fact that I'd have to sit through a mission Briefing where some dude is literally like on a screen.

761
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:42,270
Speaker 1: like go to this waypoint here.

762
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:44,617
Speaker 1: We suspect that there's enemies here.

763
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:46,301
Speaker 1: There's a transport here.

764
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:51,156
Speaker 1: You've got it like they give you this like human language Explanation of what the mission is.

765
00:47:51,176 --> 00:47:54,770
Speaker 1: but then you get into the mission, and you've got to just deal with it.

766
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,921
Speaker 1: I hope you remembered what he said.

767
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:56,810
Speaker 1: I hope you paid attention.

768
00:47:57,716 --> 00:48:01,699
Speaker 1: Yep Oh wait the rebels aren't where the guy said they were gonna be.

769
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:02,502
Speaker 1: what the fuck do I do?

770
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:02,863
Speaker 1: now?

771
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:05,740
Speaker 0: the other genre that has That same sort of.

772
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:15,772
Speaker 0: you know Immersion thing is like mech warrior time right, but the difference is that you know with something like mech warrior Right.

773
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:23,645
Speaker 0: first of all the role-playing is lessened by the lack of Star Wars and the lack of characters Quite often because wing commander also had a very rich like story.

774
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:24,127
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

775
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:24,568
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

776
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:32,527
Speaker 0: But also you know when being in a battle mech right is is slow and pondering right.

777
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:42,930
Speaker 1: you would spend a lot of time walking Right yeah, and you'd also spend a lot of time in the game like when you weren't fighting Customizing your mech and fucking around with your mech and like you're doing lots of lot.

778
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,878
Speaker 0: There's lots of long-range weaponry.

779
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but you can level up in mech warrior in tie fighter.

780
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:49,657
Speaker 1: You can't level up.

781
00:48:49,939 --> 00:48:51,810
Speaker 0: She's already good depends on which game.

782
00:48:51,850 --> 00:49:00,310
Speaker 0: It is no none of the time But the the dogfight the the of a mech is basically two mechs circles slowly circling around each other.

783
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,295
Speaker 0: Maybe one jumps.

784
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:07,781
Speaker 0: yeah right with free space shooters You the skill cap is insanely high.

785
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:17,862
Speaker 1: like you know in Star Wars when someone is like Oh They're on my tail and like you've got to shake them you're living that Reality and only your personal skill with that joystick is gonna get you out right.

786
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,310
Speaker 0: and it's like the speeds that you could reach.

787
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:22,962
Speaker 0: They let you reach are like ridiculous.

788
00:49:22,982 --> 00:49:24,830
Speaker 0: right you can go really fast.

789
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,450
Speaker 1: Oh, you know hard it was to like shoot down a transport if I was in like a Thai interceptor right?

790
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:34,590
Speaker 0: But it's like can you can you go that fat if you step on the throttle of your type fighter?

791
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,660
Speaker 0: Right and then try to fight while going at full speed.

792
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:40,190
Speaker 0: It's like can you maintain aim on the enemy?

793
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,997
Speaker 0: Can you not just crash into that space?

794
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:45,050
Speaker 0: Can you not just you know fly out of control?

795
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,511
Speaker 0: It's like.

796
00:49:45,531 --> 00:49:47,758
Speaker 0: can you keep your stuff together right?

797
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:54,283
Speaker 0: it's like and and and not only that but also Manage all your stuff right it's like your they've.

798
00:49:54,504 --> 00:49:55,490
Speaker 0: you know it's almost.

799
00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:04,390
Speaker 0: It's not the level of like Microsoft flight simulator where you're simulating every aspect of reality But you're like the fun and interesting parts, right?

800
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:16,870
Speaker 0: It's like you can manage your shields put energy to the rear shield to the front shield take away energy from the shields entirely And just go faster or start pumping shield energy like directly into your lasers that they charge up faster.

801
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:19,539
Speaker 0: Right you know it's like you you can.

802
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:29,529
Speaker 0: there's all these things you can manage in your ship And you know oh stuff on my ship got damaged, I guess I'm going slower now, right All kinds of stuff yeah

803
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:44,413
Speaker 1: and I particularly appreciated how like in the fighting and the way like battles would break down in these kinds of games a Narrative could emerge from the mechanics of the game and from the world very directly very similarly to like very few games do that well But this

804
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:51,630
Speaker 0: a lot like a dwarf fortress because this when you get your simulation level high enough And it's accounting for enough details.

805
00:50:52,172 --> 00:50:55,829
Speaker 0: There's an air is a natural narrative emergence that comes out, right?

806
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:05,485
Speaker 0: So it's like you the more details you put in the more story gets told yep and the game will reach more rich it becomes how you achieve those goals.

807
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:12,246
Speaker 1: like if I Solve the problem where like there's the traitor on the ship if I blow that ship up that works.

808
00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:16,421
Speaker 1: if I Get the Star Destroyer to come over and blow it up that also works.

809
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:24,650
Speaker 1: if I disable it and then call the stormtroopers to Come and like board the ship well, maybe now a new plot gets unlocked because now we captured this dude alive yep.

810
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:28,799
Speaker 0: So that's just high fighter, but yeah, that's just same right.

811
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,792
Speaker 0: so the same things apply though to most free space shooters Right is the?

812
00:51:33,832 --> 00:51:36,338
Speaker 0: you know that you still have those right.

813
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,225
Speaker 0: you have to control this ship right.

814
00:51:39,465 --> 00:51:41,370
Speaker 0: there's usually a mission-based game.

815
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:47,827
Speaker 0: You know the narrative emergence is still there because crazy things happen on the mission no matter how good or bad the.

816
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:54,106
Speaker 0: the game is Right and the genre as a whole seemed to have died out right.

817
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:57,046
Speaker 0: and the reason it died out At least that I can say.

818
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:58,796
Speaker 1: Factors.

819
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:04,264
Speaker 0: there's a lot of factors but the games are hard to make expensive to make.

820
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:09,890
Speaker 0: yeah right and as Games got more 3d right and technology advanced right?

821
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:15,190
Speaker 0: It's like that increased the cost of making this particular type of game a lot.

822
00:52:15,551 --> 00:52:19,825
Speaker 1: But also these games require two things that are difficult for gamers.

823
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:25,322
Speaker 1: one they require Physical peripherals that are not just commonly available.

824
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:31,582
Speaker 1: like in the era when tie fighter came out Almost everyone even non gamers had a joystick connected to their PC.

825
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:39,064
Speaker 1: like joysticks were kind of a semi standard Thing that people would just have and like every computer store just had a joystick section.

826
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:44,140
Speaker 0: right joysticks are now Specialized equipment because I mean it's even even arcade.

827
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,507
Speaker 0: joysticks are a specialized equipment for fighting game.

828
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:47,610
Speaker 0: play out right.

829
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:58,190
Speaker 0: It's like you know any kind of stick based control Which was like the default control on the Atari 2200 was just eliminated when the NES came out right from consoles.

830
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,628
Speaker 1: I got my parents like we bought.

831
00:53:00,648 --> 00:53:10,248
Speaker 1: we spent $70 in like 1980s dollars on a flight stick pro just to play Microsoft flight simulator and tie fighter because the joystick wasn't cutting it.

832
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:15,329
Speaker 0: yeah I feel like on PCs the joystick sort of died when like around the time USB came around.

833
00:53:15,971 --> 00:53:17,155
Speaker 0: Right because suddenly.

834
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:18,578
Speaker 0: It's like you got a new computer.

835
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,062
Speaker 0: It's like did.

836
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:25,919
Speaker 0: there weren't new games to demand the joystick The old games I could like old joysticks.

837
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,144
Speaker 0: We needed a game port.

838
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,770
Speaker 0: new computers didn't have the game port.

839
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, there weren't peripherals to make that work.

840
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:31,742
Speaker 1: there weren't like adapters that work.

841
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:35,616
Speaker 1: and even if there were USB joysticks I got a cheapo USB joystick.

842
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:42,570
Speaker 1: I could not get it to work with my like bootleg emulated in a virtual machine tie fighter.

843
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:49,600
Speaker 0: Yep You know there were also like you know specific things right in terms of like.

844
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,283
Speaker 0: You know the it's like.

845
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:57,670
Speaker 0: okay, we're even though someone might have wanted to continue the genre.

846
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:58,152
Speaker 0: It's like.

847
00:53:58,213 --> 00:54:07,686
Speaker 0: well Star Wars specifically wasn't in it right wing commander But like these John release the properties sort of individually fell out of game making.

848
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:09,050
Speaker 1: yeah, but there's something else.

849
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:09,917
Speaker 1: There's another factor.

850
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:17,809
Speaker 1: even if the hardware were there I feel like there's a bigger problem that these games if the kinds of games the way we enjoyed them.

851
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:22,850
Speaker 1: They require the player to learn skills to get better.

852
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:29,397
Speaker 1: And there's almost nothing in these games to help you get to help you get better Except by getting better.

853
00:54:29,698 --> 00:54:29,818
Speaker 1: like.

854
00:54:29,859 --> 00:54:31,466
Speaker 1: there's no leveling up your biz.

855
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:39,030
Speaker 1: you have to just Literally learn the skill of dogfight in this complex machine and learn the nuances of this machine, right?

856
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:46,637
Speaker 0: To make the game more accessible to more people right or to make it playable with a gamepad or lesser controls Right in any sort of reasonable way.

857
00:54:46,657 --> 00:54:50,793
Speaker 0: you have to dumb the game down to the point at which it's no longer the same Genre right.

858
00:54:50,813 --> 00:54:53,162
Speaker 0: you look at like rogue squadron on like the n64.

859
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:54,045
Speaker 0: I played those games.

860
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:56,958
Speaker 0: They were okay, but like yeah It's like it's a good game, but it's not even this.

861
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:58,144
Speaker 0: it's not even the same genre.

862
00:54:58,185 --> 00:54:59,169
Speaker 0: It's not as that itch.

863
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:00,275
Speaker 0: There's an x-wing.

864
00:55:00,315 --> 00:55:02,484
Speaker 0: it's shooting things, but it's really just a rail shooter.

865
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:06,503
Speaker 0: It's Star Fox right It's not a free space shooter, and it's like.

866
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:09,416
Speaker 0: you know if you have an FPS You can get people.

867
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:12,710
Speaker 0: FPS's aren't the easiest, but you can get people up into FPS.

868
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:15,530
Speaker 0: You can play one with a gamepad with two sticks on it, right?

869
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,628
Speaker 0: It's like you can get someone with a tutorial level to learn to control an FPS.

870
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:21,230
Speaker 0: It's like not.

871
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,274
Speaker 0: It's like it's not a mountain.

872
00:55:22,315 --> 00:55:22,756
Speaker 0: It's a hill.

873
00:55:22,817 --> 00:55:23,018
Speaker 0: right.

874
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:33,942
Speaker 0: yeah, if you drop someone in tie fighter level one No enemies nothing to crash into right just like like fly from point a to point B. That's all you ask them to do.

875
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:36,965
Speaker 0: It's like It's not easy like.

876
00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:38,975
Speaker 1: as a kid you know how I learned to play tie fighter.

877
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:46,110
Speaker 1: it came with this long book and I read the book and then I had the Book open while I was futzing around in the game.

878
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:52,105
Speaker 1: And now there have been games that have tried to do this over over time.

879
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:55,690
Speaker 1: some of them succeeded a little bit But like the genre is still relatively morbid.

880
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:59,794
Speaker 0: Yeah So that's how that is.

881
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:05,030
Speaker 0: so now the big news is that EA is making what's the name of this game?

882
00:56:05,514 --> 00:56:07,589
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the a Star Wars something.

883
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, find it again.

884
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,580
Speaker 0: Supposedly we're gonna find out the truth the full truth in a few days.

885
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:17,361
Speaker 0: But the current truth?

886
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:18,809
Speaker 1: Star Wars squadrons.

887
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:31,645
Speaker 1: Right so it less light art of Starfighter combat in immersive piloting experience with Star Wars squadrons and scrolling through this thing It looks like it might be exactly what I want.

888
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:35,528
Speaker 0: right the information They have released so far is all there.

889
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,395
Speaker 1: It's like they're saying all the right like.

890
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,880
Speaker 1: look at this for the first screenshot.

891
00:56:39,201 --> 00:56:41,690
Speaker 1: playing your skirmish in the briefing room.

892
00:56:42,392 --> 00:56:45,964
Speaker 0: Right everything that they have revealed so far is like yes.

893
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:46,245
Speaker 0: Yes.

894
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:52,369
Speaker 1: Yes, right first person Can modify your ship divert power between its systems, right?

895
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,243
Speaker 0: There's supposedly multiplayer and single-player.

896
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:57,490
Speaker 1: first five dogfights.

897
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:02,463
Speaker 0: Yes, there's gonna be all kinds of story and a wings.

898
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:04,930
Speaker 0: be wings x-wings y-wings Thai fighters.

899
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,439
Speaker 0: I advance support bombers reality.

900
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,579
Speaker 1: This is a killer app for virtual reality You know, they confirm that it supports VR and hotels.

901
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta get that hot ass hot ass Right.

902
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:20,860
Speaker 0: It's like everything they've said so far.

903
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,630
Speaker 0: It's like EA is the worst, but it's like almost the worst.

904
00:57:24,713 --> 00:57:25,896
Speaker 0: But it's like everything they've said.

905
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:29,226
Speaker 1: I trust everything about this website except the fact that it's EA.

906
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:34,342
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much Seems like wow, they are really bringing it back aren't they?

907
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:35,065
Speaker 0: it's gonna be.

908
00:57:35,105 --> 00:57:36,450
Speaker 0: this is gonna be it, right?

909
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:39,246
Speaker 0: But this close what it might even be worth buying some VR.

910
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:39,850
Speaker 0: I don't know.

911
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,633
Speaker 0: Well, well,

912
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:50,969
Speaker 1: you can try the VR in my place first because my dream has been to play a game like tie fighter with a VR helmet on But just like holding my joy like having a joystick Like a hot ass in front of me

913
00:57:51,391 --> 00:57:53,279
Speaker 0: I couldn't I couldn't get rimmed to play netrunner.

914
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:56,768
Speaker 0: He couldn't get me to play overwatch, but maybe this will be our game We can play.

915
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,158
Speaker 0: We'll make a little make eat.

916
00:57:59,178 --> 00:58:00,265
Speaker 0: We'll make eat night squadron.

917
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:02,215
Speaker 1: So stay tuned Like we're gonna get it.

918
00:58:02,235 --> 00:58:04,666
Speaker 1: we're gonna get on this and see what the deal is.

919
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:27,970
Speaker 1: uh If this game is good It actually closes one of the longest open chapters in geek nice history because in ancient ancient times like so long ago We didn't even video this panel and we only ran it once at PAX West once It was called egregiously unrealized potential and we just listed all the Obvious genres and obvious games that should be remade.

920
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,171
Speaker 1: there's.

921
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:30,559
Speaker 1: no one was remaking and we couldn't understand why and how.

922
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:42,610
Speaker 1: there's just a pile of money waiting for someone to pick up and Literally every game we talked about in that panel Except tie fighter s games had been remade basically exactly as we described.

923
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:44,277
Speaker 1: This is the last one.

924
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:49,256
Speaker 0: the one thing that we poke about Wasn't ever fully fulfilled.

925
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:52,716
Speaker 1: drew Pokemon go Edged into that territory.

926
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:55,370
Speaker 0: It's like there's a bunch of things combined that get really close.

927
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,280
Speaker 0: There's like MMOs that are basically Pokemon clones.

928
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, Pokemon itself got closer to em, but there is not Pokemon MMO.

929
00:59:02,898 --> 00:59:12,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is not the dream Pokemon MMO But otherwise if this game comes out and is good we've gotten pretty much everything we wanted out of that panel.

930
00:59:13,068 --> 00:59:16,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Yeah, free space shooters, you know, there's.

931
00:59:17,061 --> 00:59:18,708
Speaker 0: there are some newer ones out there.

932
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:20,629
Speaker 1: I've tried a bunch of them.

933
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,015
Speaker 1: They they don't like.

934
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:33,818
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into like specifics of a bunch of the ones I played but they all failed me And like odd ways or they're not satisfying or some of them try to be too accurate with the physics Which takes away a lot of the fun.

935
00:59:33,878 --> 00:59:36,830
Speaker 0: It's like you need to leave some of the arcade gameplay in there, right?

936
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, it can't just be like yeah true hard science real Have shit.

937
00:59:42,977 --> 00:59:45,165
Speaker 1: for momentum you could just stop on a dime, right?

938
00:59:45,226 --> 00:59:46,490
Speaker 0: It's too hard to do that It's.

939
00:59:46,571 --> 00:59:46,672
Speaker 0: it's.

940
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,503
Speaker 0: it's already hard enough as it is.

941
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:51,280
Speaker 0: It's like you don't wanna make it harder Yep, or something.

942
00:59:51,461 --> 00:59:58,050
Speaker 1: have the free space elements But they're mostly either fetch quest type games or like their narrative games.

943
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:05,217
Speaker 1: But the narrative is not tied to what you're doing in the spaceship so much as like where you're going in the spaceship Right or simply a lot of the games.

944
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:10,860
Speaker 0: It's just like they're not a lot of people playing them So you can't get your multiplayer action on right.

945
01:00:11,664 --> 01:00:15,522
Speaker 0: I've seen some of them that the mistake They make is like the the space that you're playing.

946
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:26,228
Speaker 0: it is too big and kind of empty And there's a lot of like quiet flying around as opposed to you know even you watch a Star Wars movie And it's like yeah, they're out in space this infinite space that you could fly around in.

947
01:00:27,212 --> 01:00:32,568
Speaker 0: But really the battle is contained right in a tight spot with a lot of ships in a small space.

948
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,905
Speaker 0: right That's what Star Wars is yeah.

949
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:43,739
Speaker 0: And then the other good free space shooters were the same thing the wing commanders and the descent free space and descent descent and All the other good ones.

950
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,233
Speaker 0: right they were all Small.

951
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:46,977
Speaker 0: you know you're.

952
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:56,839
Speaker 0: it's like even though you're fraud you're flying free But you're you're in a. you're like you're in a bottle right with a whole bunch of other people flying free And that's what makes it wild and crazy and fun.

953
01:00:56,859 --> 01:01:09,487
Speaker 0: if you're out in like space quiet It's like that's good for like 2001 Space Odyssey, but that doesn't scratch my tie fighter it just scratches a very different itch.

954
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:10,430
Speaker 0: yeah.

955
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:12,842
Speaker 0: So that's how that is.

956
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:21,050
Speaker 1: so All I will say is that I am cautiously optimistic about this name, and I'm going to play it to see what the deal is.

957
01:01:24,062 --> 01:01:26,600
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
