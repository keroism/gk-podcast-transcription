1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,099
Speaker 0: I feel like it's Tigress and Euphrates season suddenly.

2
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,838
Speaker 1: How is that a season?

3
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:17,239
Speaker 0: I feel like that's what happens.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,380
Speaker 1: Spring, summer, fall, went to Tigress and Euphrates.

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,139
Speaker 0: You know, if those were the four seasons, I would have a pretty good life going on.

6
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:36,080
Speaker 0: I think what happened is just that because we taught some people how to play and we did a live stream the other weekend, and then the following weekend, more friends came out and we just played it because we all know how to play.

7
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:40,539
Speaker 0: I also kind of got hustled in that game.

8
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,799
Speaker 0: Emily beat me in a game that we played with Phil and Jay the other night.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,460
Speaker 0: And basically what happened was, the first game that we played, I won the game and crushed everybody.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,900
Speaker 0: It was partly because Jay attacked me and I just happened to have four green tiles in my hand.

11
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,120
Speaker 1: It just happened.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,439
Speaker 0: Like they were there, I got attacked, I was like, "Well...".

13
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,880
Speaker 1: You didn't see the attack coming?

14
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,699
Speaker 0: I did not expect the attack at that time.

15
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:06,746
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing.

16
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,200
Speaker 1: When I play Tigress and Euphrates, I basically see the future.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,557
Speaker 1: Because every...

18
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,380
Speaker 0: Well, if you can see the future, you didn't see the future of me winning.

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,040
Speaker 1: People only have two actions, right?

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,660
Speaker 1: So you can't really surprise anyone.

21
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:24,000
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy to see every possible conflict that could happen on your turn.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,642
Speaker 0: Well, you should be clear.

23
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:28,074
Speaker 0: You can't necessarily predict what people will do, but you can narrow it down to.

24
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,720
Speaker 0: there's only a few things they can do.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,440
Speaker 1: But at least in a four player game it's harder, but in a two player game it's ridiculously easy.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:45,580
Speaker 0: It's more that in this attack, it was a strong, augmented attack from a hand that happened to be repulsed by an equally lucky strong defense from the hand.

27
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,176
Speaker 0: The kingdoms themselves were not that powerful in either direction.

28
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:49,779
Speaker 0: It was pretty even.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,934
Speaker 0: But then the next game, I was winning hand over fist.

30
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:55,280
Speaker 0: Just hand over fist.

31
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,800
Speaker 0: And then I attack Emily.

32
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:03,260
Speaker 0: And if I won that conflict, I would have won the game mathematically.

33
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,780
Speaker 0: There was nothing anyone could have done to stop me.

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,880
Speaker 1: But she had six tiles.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,779
Speaker 0: She just has a handful of black tiles.

36
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:12,458
Speaker 0: And just due to the way the game ended...

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,260
Speaker 1: You couldn't get your black guy back on the board.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,349
Speaker 0: I had like 15, 15, 15, 4 at one point as the score.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
Speaker 1: You couldn't get the black guy back on the board.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,940
Speaker 0: Ah, so the next turn, because I was still winning and I had a chance, I internal conflicted with my black leader...

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
Speaker 1: That's the only way to get it back on.

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,260
Speaker 0: ...to get onto a spot that had two black monuments.

43
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:35,160
Speaker 0: And yeah, once again, Emily just happened to have a whole bunch of red tiles in her hand.

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,446
Speaker 1: See, here's the thing, right?

45
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,620
Speaker 1: So here's some basic T&E strategies.

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,280
Speaker 1: We're not going to do a whole show on this, right?

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:40,541
Speaker 0: No.

48
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:41,974
Speaker 0: Well, we have done a whole show on it.

49
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:42,580
Speaker 0: I'll link to it.

50
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,033
Speaker 1: You can see what's coming and you can look at your tiles in your hand and you can tell, "Aha, a black conflict is coming.

51
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:50,738
Speaker 1: Am I going to win

52
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:50,819
Speaker 1: it?".

53
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:57,320
Speaker 1: If you're not going to win it, you can either A, abandon it or B, dump tiles to try to get black tiles.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,562
Speaker 0: Yup.

55
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,291
Speaker 0: Now...

56
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,960
Speaker 1: Other basic strategy.

57
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 0: Well, what was I saying the other day?

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,020
Speaker 0: The two most powerful things you can likely do in that game are build a monument in someone else's kingdom.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,460
Speaker 1: Yup.

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,940
Speaker 0: Or start a fight between two other people's kingdoms.

61
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,680
Speaker 1: You can also, the catastrophe can swing you.

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:23,480
Speaker 1: If you don't have the red tiles to get, if the kingdoms are big and are stable, then you can only use internal conflicts to get your guy back on the board, right?

63
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,858
Speaker 1: It's very hard to use external conflicts to get back on the board.

64
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,780
Speaker 1: Unless you go back on the board in a shitty location and just start taking two points, not the greatest.

65
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,148
Speaker 1: So, you need red tiles to get back on the board.

66
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:37,880
Speaker 1: You can dump to get red tiles or you can use catastrophes.

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:48,369
Speaker 1: That'll probably get you back on, but if you use your catastrophes first against someone to get back on the board, they still have their catastrophes.

68
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,340
Speaker 1: You don't want to be the first person to catastrophe.

69
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:52,039
Speaker 0: Yup.

70
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,840
Speaker 1: You want to be the last person to catastrophe.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,799
Speaker 0: If you're building a snake tendril of a kingdom out to touch somebody and make some mischief, and that somebody doesn't have any catastrophes left.

72
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:13,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you still have catastrophes and the other players have been forced to use them all, then what you can do is you can start using board positions that are normally weak to catastrophe with no fear.

73
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,094
Speaker 0: Like four leaders huddled around one un-treasured red.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,488
Speaker 1: You can leave a leader next to one red tile.

75
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,940
Speaker 1: You can make a long snake of tiles to grab a treasure.

76
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:43,120
Speaker 1: You can do all this stuff that you normally cannot do when catastrophes are out, but if you can force the other player to use theirs to get back onto the board by kicking them off and maybe blocking a nice internal conflict, like if they try to internal their way back on and they lose, they have to catastrophe their way back on, catastrophe them off, take your position back.

77
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,319
Speaker 1: They're out of catastrophes and now they're done.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,281
Speaker 0: Yup.

79
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:50,172
Speaker 0: Seriously, you know, we talk a lot about board games.

80
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:53,167
Speaker 0: We play a lot of board games and, well, we played.

81
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,978
Speaker 0: Lately, Scott doesn't play as many.

82
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,060
Speaker 0: But Tigris and Euphrates has consistently remained my favorite tabletop board game.

83
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:03,899
Speaker 1: So good.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,600
Speaker 0: There are a few games that I might argue are better.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,270
Speaker 0: It really depends on what you mean by better, like.

86
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,719
Speaker 0: better at, you know, what's a good at.

87
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,500
Speaker 0: Like Puerto Rico is probably a more finely tuned test of skill in a general sense.

88
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,200
Speaker 1: There's no random tile grab.

89
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:22,920
Speaker 0: Eclipse, however, is better at like satisfying that big old war game intense feeling.

90
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,807
Speaker 0: But in terms of the average of all possible aspects of a game, Tigris and Euphrates is far and away my favorite tabletop game.

91
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,207
Speaker 0: And it's telling that after all these years, nothing has unseated it.

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,479
Speaker 0: Even games that I really like.

93
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,241
Speaker 1: All right.

94
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:42,600
Speaker 1: So in the news, there's a new board game coming out that was announced today.

95
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,145
Speaker 1: Look at how new this news is.

96
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:57,972
Speaker 1: Fantasy Flight Games, publishers of such games as Netrunner and others you may enjoy, Citadel's, I guess, are now going to publish X-Com, the board game.

97
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,399
Speaker 1: Oh my glob.

98
00:05:59,439 --> 00:05:59,600
Speaker 1: So.

99
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,487
Speaker 0: Well, well, oh my glob.

100
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:06,669
Speaker 0: It's funny you say that because usually when there's property, I like game in that property.

101
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,056
Speaker 0: warning signs.

102
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:08,760
Speaker 1: That is true.

103
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,280
Speaker 0: But Fantasy Flight, not like Cryptozoic.

104
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,709
Speaker 1: So this is the thing people don't realize.

105
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:19,232
Speaker 1: is that X-Com, there's an interview I watched with the CEO of Fantasy Flight Games.

106
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,000
Speaker 0: You almost said the CEO of X-Com.

107
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,747
Speaker 1: No, the CEO of Fantasy Flight Games.

108
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:25,140
Speaker 1: So I guess is now possibly also the CEO of X-Com.

109
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:33,627
Speaker 1: And they asked him, how do you choose which properties to license and how do you get such good licensed properties?

110
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,773
Speaker 1: Because they do Star Wars.

111
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:36,080
Speaker 1: They're making X-Wing, right?

112
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,803
Speaker 1: Star Wars.

113
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,940
Speaker 1: What bigger licensed property is there than Star Wars?

114
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,530
Speaker 1: They're doing Warhammer and they're not games workshop.

115
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:42,454
Speaker 1: Okay.

116
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:46,168
Speaker 1: It's like, how are you getting these properties as Fantasy Flight?

117
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,100
Speaker 1: And he's basically like, look, we do such a good job.

118
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,620
Speaker 1: All the licensers are coming to us trying to get us to make games for them.

119
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:53,102
Speaker 0: Yeah.

120
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,146
Speaker 0: Take, take note of that.

121
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,000
Speaker 0: Anyone who goes to Cryptozoic and we turn most of them down.

122
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,559
Speaker 1: And then I guess they go to Cryptozoic and who always says yes and just make some piece of shit.

123
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,159
Speaker 1: So the fact that they said yes to X-Com, right, is a big deal.

124
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,367
Speaker 1: So is this game good?

125
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:12,059
Speaker 1: Well, let's see what we know about the game so far.

126
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,540
Speaker 0: It has an embed, like an app that goes with it.

127
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,760
Speaker 0: Right.

128
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,442
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

129
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:26,100
Speaker 1: All the descriptions of this game seem to suggest it's a combination of Pandemic, which sucks, and Space Alert, which is good.

130
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,579
Speaker 0: The board game is a hybrid digital game that requires a companion app.

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,682
Speaker 1: Right.

132
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:35,760
Speaker 1: So Space Alert uses like a CD or an MP3 or a cassette or whatever it uses.

133
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,765
Speaker 1: This uses an app.

134
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:44,075
Speaker 1: So it's basically it's more versatile and they could update the app to add more scenarios and things of that nature.

135
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:44,839
Speaker 1: So that can be pretty cool.

136
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,026
Speaker 0: Of course, you could also.

137
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,720
Speaker 0: it could also be Omega virus.

138
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,885
Speaker 1: It could also be Omega virus.

139
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:56,828
Speaker 1: But so basically you and your friends are co-op against the game, which is X-Com, the aliens.

140
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,480
Speaker 1: And each person does something different, right?

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:10,580
Speaker 1: You've got the chief scientist who manages the science, the commander who moves the interceptors around the central officer who basically pays attention to the app and also the satellites.

142
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:14,020
Speaker 1: The squad leader manages the units who come out of the sky ranger.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,589
Speaker 1: And so each person has their own job.

144
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:27,314
Speaker 1: And it doesn't seem like the jobs are programming related, which fixes the Space Alert problem of some of the people you're playing with can't program even for instructions and are incompetent.

145
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:33,390
Speaker 1: So you can't actually play Space Alert properly by making it more pandemic like.

146
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:39,693
Speaker 1: And at the same time, each person has to concentrate on a completely different thing, not more pandemic.

147
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:40,880
Speaker 1: Everyone's doing the same thing.

148
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,051
Speaker 1: So you is going to be less quarterbacking because of that.

149
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:54,740
Speaker 1: And also because it's real time with this app telling you what's going on and having to react to the app in real time, there's less quarterbacking because one person can't handle all four jobs.

150
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,487
Speaker 0: You need four people.

151
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,572
Speaker 0: That's a big factor.

152
00:08:57,612 --> 00:09:01,649
Speaker 0: The game now becomes much more reliant upon things like charisma, shouting ability.

153
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,340
Speaker 1: But you're all on the same team.

154
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:08,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even on the same team, you're not going to charisma the aliens into leaving.

155
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 0: No, but you're going to charisma your friend into doing what you tell him at the critical moment.

156
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:31,399
Speaker 1: I mean, if you can even, you know, hopefully it looks like like there's so little information about the game, but looking at the board and the pieces, it looks like each player has so much going on that I don't know if you could really like even pay attention enough to what the other people are doing in order to manage more than one of these jobs at a time.

158
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,114
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's some smart person out there going to handle two or three of the jobs.

159
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,125
Speaker 1: handling all four at the same time seems pretty difficult.

160
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,460
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, this looks like it'll be fun.

161
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,232
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'll pay for it, depending how much it is.

162
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:50,315
Speaker 1: I think I might sell a bunch of board games I don't play and buy this if I can't convince someone else to buy it.

163
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,038
Speaker 0: We'll see.

164
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,343
Speaker 0: I wonder if we'll be able to.

165
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:53,888
Speaker 1: I really want to try it at PAX.

166
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:57,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a game that I don't know.

167
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,121
Speaker 0: It could be good.

168
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,843
Speaker 0: It could be bad.

169
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:01,951
Speaker 0: There's factors in both directions.

170
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:02,553
Speaker 1: Yep.

171
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,334
Speaker 1: It's just exciting to see the XCOM license used at all for something besides a video game.

172
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:11,065
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, people forget the days of like XCOM Interceptor.

173
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,429
Speaker 1: Well, that's a video game.

174
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,014
Speaker 0: Yes, a bad video game.

175
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:14,416
Speaker 1: Yes.

176
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:19,614
Speaker 1: But I wish that, you know, the XCOM license were used more often on other things.

177
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,849
Speaker 0: Also, I was reminded why you should never read comments on articles.

178
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,124
Speaker 0: The comments on this polygon article about this are choice.

179
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,047
Speaker 0: Okay.

180
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:28,873
Speaker 0: Here, I'm going to quote one of these guys.

181
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:32,661
Speaker 0: This is trinium 1029.

182
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,145
Speaker 0: I'm sorry, but no.

183
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:41,792
Speaker 0: XCOM is great as a video game because it allows for real tactical decisions without needing to worry about a bunch of numbers and fuzzy stuff.

184
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:43,640
Speaker 0: Board games aren't so good at.

185
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,045
Speaker 1: XCOM has no numbers.

186
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:51,659
Speaker 0: He says that board games are bad at being real tactical games.

187
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,722
Speaker 0: is what he's saying here.

188
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:54,026
Speaker 1: Okay.

189
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:55,271
Speaker 0: I agree.

190
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,980
Speaker 0: Converting the XCOM to a board game seems like a painful experience.

191
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,690
Speaker 0: The plot and theme would make for a great game.

192
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:04,407
Speaker 0: These people, it's like they have no idea how to evaluate.

193
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:07,199
Speaker 1: Well, also he's like, it would be a bunch of numbers and stuff.

194
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,242
Speaker 1: In other words, I'm dumb.

195
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,628
Speaker 1: No want to do hard thing.

196
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,296
Speaker 1: In other words, you're dumb.

197
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,403
Speaker 1: We should not consider anything you have to say.

198
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,771
Speaker 1: You admit ignorance and anti-intellectualism.

199
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:20,906
Speaker 1: If you are proud of being stupid, why don't we just kill you?

200
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,231
Speaker 1: You're worthless and you admitted it.

201
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:26,874
Speaker 0: You should go post there because you're right in the tone of this discussion.

202
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,860
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I'm saying.

203
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,184
Speaker 1: Perfect internet comment.

204
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,635
Speaker 0: Plus five would read again.

205
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,563
Speaker 1: I'm even posting this comment to the internet in MP3 form.

206
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:36,285
Speaker 1: It's so fancy.

207
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,262
Speaker 0: I suspect if I have to guess, I think this is going to be a fun game.

208
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:43,508
Speaker 1: It could be good.

209
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,371
Speaker 1: It's worth it.

210
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,722
Speaker 1: It's going to be worth playing at least once to see how this app works.

211
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:47,464
Speaker 1: Now here's the thing.

212
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,571
Speaker 1: Requires this app.

213
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,916
Speaker 0: That's fine by me.

214
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:54,066
Speaker 1: Which you can use in a computer, a tablet, a phone, whatever.

215
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:55,370
Speaker 1: Even a desktop.

216
00:11:56,052 --> 00:12:00,727
Speaker 1: But what about those people who don't have any computing device whatsoever?

217
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:02,232
Speaker 1: Yeah.

218
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:08,017
Speaker 0: I'm going to have to get four friends and they're each going to have to buy a Game Boy Advance and the Game Boy Advance link cable.

219
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:09,806
Speaker 1: You know people are going to say that?

220
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:10,309
Speaker 0: Yep.

221
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,240
Speaker 1: They're going to be like, "I can't play this game because I don't have the

222
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,481
Speaker 1: app.".

223
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,147
Speaker 1: Or, "The game's at a convention.

224
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,894
Speaker 1: Check it out of the library.

225
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:19,549
Speaker 1: You don't have the app on your phone and no one does either in the

226
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:19,870
Speaker 1: group.".

227
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,642
Speaker 0: And the wireless is too slow because you're at a convention.

228
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:25,660
Speaker 1: You can't get the game because you got to download this massive app over wireless.

229
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,692
Speaker 1: Is the convention going to put a tablet in the game box?

230
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:30,753
Speaker 0: No.

231
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,618
Speaker 0: Well, I could see.

232
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:39,444
Speaker 0: so I could see like mag fest like having one person who just did that because they'd be pretty trusting of that.

233
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:40,388
Speaker 1: Maybe.

234
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:41,673
Speaker 0: I don't see that happening at PAX.

235
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:46,733
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, right, that's a problem for this game and convention libraries and other game libraries.

236
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:48,981
Speaker 0: What I would do is, you know what?

237
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,373
Speaker 1: It's also a problem for this game in the distant future.

238
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:57,394
Speaker 1: if you don't have some, you know, this app isn't going to be updated for all time, right?

239
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:00,605
Speaker 1: It'll probably stop working on iOS 12 or Android 20 something.

240
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:07,280
Speaker 1: It can go into the pile of such games as Tribes 2 and Quake 2.

241
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,334
Speaker 1: But it's a board game, so board games usually don't become unplayable.

242
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:18,331
Speaker 0: I have a WWF, that's how old it is, wrestling game that requires a VHS tape.

243
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:20,558
Speaker 0: I don't have a VHS player.

244
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,889
Speaker 1: No, but you can get a copy of that video in YouTube or something.

245
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,374
Speaker 0: I wonder if I can, actually.

246
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:27,462
Speaker 0: This is a piece of software.

247
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:31,477
Speaker 1: You would need like an iPhone emulator and a copy of it or something.

248
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:37,318
Speaker 1: It would not be as easy to play this game in the distant future when the software is no longer available.

249
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,646
Speaker 0: Playing Tribes 2.

250
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:43,820
Speaker 1: Well, there is a desktop version of this app, it appears, because it's a picture of a laptop.

251
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:50,961
Speaker 1: So whether I buy this game or not, I'm going to download the software and then keep it somewhere safe.

252
00:13:52,024 --> 00:14:03,237
Speaker 0: So here's the thing, if this game is good enough to be remembered to the point that anyone would want to play it after it is sort of expired technologically, it'll be kept around.

253
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:07,976
Speaker 0: I mean, how many packs of every ROM from every console ever are available online?

254
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,808
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, this is not, you know, it's not guaranteed.

255
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:16,885
Speaker 0: It's guaranteed because if it's forgotten, it was forgotten for a reason.

256
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,356
Speaker 1: There are things that are forgotten that shouldn't be.

257
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:20,219
Speaker 0: Very few.

258
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,904
Speaker 0: Some things.

259
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:22,852
Speaker 1: Nothing lasts forever.

260
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:23,960
Speaker 0: Some things ye mighty.

261
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,529
Speaker 0: So in other news, I want to bring this up briefly.

262
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:34,408
Speaker 0: We've been talking a lot and everyone's been talking a lot about Nintendo's not doing well.

263
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:35,653
Speaker 1: No, they're doing awful.

264
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:39,749
Speaker 0: You guys really need to pay attention to how poorly Nintendo is doing.

265
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,793
Speaker 1: Super awful.

266
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:46,740
Speaker 0: This isn't just like, I mean, like there were times in the past where they'd have like a weird, like, Oh my God, we were unprofitable.

267
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,592
Speaker 1: And then they came back and it was just like Apple came back.

268
00:14:49,613 --> 00:15:00,193
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of those instances were due to things like currency fluctuations or cycles missing between like when Sony releases something, but Nintendo doesn't have something to release that quarter.

269
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:00,999
Speaker 0: Like all sorts of things.

270
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,774
Speaker 0: Nintendo lost $97 million in the quarter ending June 30th.

271
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:07,135
Speaker 1: Okay.

272
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,238
Speaker 1: So Nintendo lost $97 million.

273
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,051
Speaker 1: Let me tell you some unrelated news just to give you some scope.

274
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:12,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

275
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:19,677
Speaker 1: Bernie Ecclestone, the F1 guy basically was mad bribery corruption and he was going to go to jail.

276
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:27,620
Speaker 1: And in fact, the other guy who was involved is in jail and he paid the court a hundred million dollars to not go to jail.

277
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,361
Speaker 1: Basically.

278
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:35,097
Speaker 1: So Nintendo lost less money than that dude paid to not go to jail.

279
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,523
Speaker 1: That's how much money 1% has.

280
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,469
Speaker 1: But there you go.

281
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,271
Speaker 0: That's just sad.

282
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:41,174
Speaker 1: Think about that.

283
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:41,856
Speaker 0: Yeah.

284
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 0: That's why Luigi is so mad.

285
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:47,180
Speaker 1: If they just gave that money to Nintendo, Nintendo would be in the profit zone.

286
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,068
Speaker 0: So why is Nintendo not profitable?

287
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,534
Speaker 1: Well, no one's buying their shit.

288
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,177
Speaker 1: Wii U sucks.

289
00:15:52,237 --> 00:16:01,179
Speaker 0: No one's buying the Wii U and no one bought a Wii U who didn't already own one to play Mario Kart 8.

290
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:06,200
Speaker 1: Why would I buy a Wii U just for Mario Kart when I already have 10 Mario Karts that are perfectly awesome?

291
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:13,465
Speaker 0: Just remember that there was a time in my life where GameCube, we had to own one because there's going to be a Mario Kart.

292
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:14,550
Speaker 0: We didn't buy GameCube.

293
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,540
Speaker 1: We didn't even buy GameCube for Mario Kart.

294
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

295
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,435
Speaker 0: But we bought a big GameCube because you knew that there'd be one.

296
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,668
Speaker 1: I don't even own Double Dash and I've hardly played it.

297
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,111
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:23,237
Speaker 1: I don't even like Double Dash.

299
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,086
Speaker 1: It's one of the worser Mario Karts in my book.

300
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:25,689
Speaker 1: Worser.

301
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,135
Speaker 0: Not one of the worst though.

302
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,099
Speaker 1: No, it's not the worst.

303
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,926
Speaker 1: It's not a great Mario Kart.

304
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,431
Speaker 1: Take that.

305
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:32,616
Speaker 1: People are mad at me now.

306
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:33,358
Speaker 0: Of course they are.

307
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:39,567
Speaker 0: A lot of people I know think that's the best Mario Kart because usually it's the people who are bad at Mario Kart who like to be the partner in the back.

308
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:43,643
Speaker 1: Those are the people who can't play the real Mario Kart on the Game Boy Advance.

309
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:44,024
Speaker 0: Yeah.

310
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,393
Speaker 0: What about the snaking Mario Kart on the DS?

311
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,416
Speaker 1: That's really bad.

312
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:51,290
Speaker 1: Actually, that could be the best one if it didn't have the snaking.

313
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,134
Speaker 0: But for snaking.

314
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:56,249
Speaker 0: Well, we're going to talk about snaking at our panel at PAX on how to win at games.

315
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,651
Speaker 0: Right.

316
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:57,875
Speaker 0: On Monday at noon.

317
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:04,422
Speaker 0: But the problem is that Nintendo does not have a lot to bring to the table anymore and they've gotten to the point.

318
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:04,622
Speaker 0: They do.

319
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,169
Speaker 1: They're just not bringing it to the table.

320
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:08,579
Speaker 0: Well, as a result, they don't.

321
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,903
Speaker 1: Pokemon MMO.

322
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,026
Speaker 0: Come on.

323
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,297
Speaker 1: How desperate do they have to be to make the Pokemon MMO?

324
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,040
Speaker 0: If they were going to make the Pokemon MMO, it would have to be on the PC and mobile devices, not on a Wii U.

325
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,923
Speaker 1: Yes.

326
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,107
Speaker 1: Just fucking do it.

327
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:32,466
Speaker 0: The problem is Nintendo's gotten to the point now to where their first party games are no longer, oh shit, I need to own the console to play that game or the current generation of those games.

328
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,940
Speaker 1: Of course not, because those games aren't Super Metroid 2.

329
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,928
Speaker 0: They're also not getting better.

330
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,882
Speaker 0: Mario Kart 8 is, you know, it's got a lot going for it, but it's not.

331
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:43,830
Speaker 1: How is it any different from Wii Mario Kart?

332
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:44,895
Speaker 0: Minor improvements.

333
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:46,461
Speaker 0: The Luigi Death Stare.

334
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:47,224
Speaker 1: Okay.

335
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:47,605
Speaker 1: Yeah.

336
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,271
Speaker 0: The network works better.

337
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,277
Speaker 1: Probably the same as Wii Mario Kart.

338
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,622
Speaker 1: What do I need it for?

339
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,813
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's great, but it's not worth paying money for.

340
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,522
Speaker 1: when I can play Wii Mario Kart.

341
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,155
Speaker 0: I'm actually still really liking the 3DS Mario Kart.

342
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's an okay Mario Kart.

343
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,708
Speaker 0: Also, look at the Mario Tennis.

344
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,560
Speaker 0: Recent Mario Tennises have gotten easier and worse.

345
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:07,443
Speaker 1: Yep.

346
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:08,387
Speaker 0: Objectively worse.

347
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:09,774
Speaker 1: I got GameCube Mario Tennis.

348
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:10,960
Speaker 1: What do I need another Mario Tennis for?

349
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,000
Speaker 0: I think GameCube Mario Tennis was the peak of Mario Tennis and it's been a decline since then.

350
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,622
Speaker 1: Obviously.

351
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:20,417
Speaker 1: Well, did you ever play the GBA Mario Tennis?

352
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,843
Speaker 0: Yes, I have played it, but I never owned it.

353
00:18:21,863 --> 00:18:29,976
Speaker 1: The GBA Mario Tennis is made by the people who made Golden Sun using the same engine and it's got like an RPG aspect to it.

354
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,120
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty awesome.

355
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:32,807
Speaker 1: I recommend checking it out.

356
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:38,494
Speaker 1: I don't recommend maybe playing the whole thing because it takes a while, but it's worth seeing for like, "Ooh, this

357
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:38,876
Speaker 1: happened.".

358
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,361
Speaker 0: I don't think Nintendo is going to recover.

359
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:42,147
Speaker 1: Maybe not.

360
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,491
Speaker 0: I don't foresee.

361
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:48,049
Speaker 1: I would just, I hope that they could recover so easily if they would just do what I tell them.

362
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:49,456
Speaker 0: Well, look at what happened.

363
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:52,611
Speaker 1: The thing about this, all right, so here's something someone pointed out the other day, right?

364
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:57,489
Speaker 1: We talk about, people are talking about like PS4 and Xbone.

365
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,280
Speaker 1: There's more 3DSs than PS4s and Xbone combined.

366
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,802
Speaker 0: Well, watch out.

367
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,610
Speaker 0: The PS4 is selling like crazy.

368
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,654
Speaker 0: The Xbone's not.

369
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:06,521
Speaker 1: It seems like the PS4 is winning, for sure.

370
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,544
Speaker 0: Winning, I think won.

371
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:08,808
Speaker 0: I think done.

372
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,851
Speaker 1: Probably, yeah.

373
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:15,150
Speaker 1: But still, 3DS is crushed both of them by a lot, right?

374
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,118
Speaker 0: Is that just because it's been a lot longer?

375
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:23,116
Speaker 1: Why doesn't Nintendo just abandon their Wii garbage and just go full-on 3DS and give the people what they want?

376
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:26,833
Speaker 1: Nintendo's main problem is not that they can't give the people what they want.

377
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:27,195
Speaker 1: They won't.

378
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:32,703
Speaker 1: If Nintendo would just do what we tell them, as we've been saying on this show, for as long as this show has existed.

379
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:36,157
Speaker 0: Well, in the GameCube era, they would make all the money.

380
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,101
Speaker 1: The profit would go whoop.

381
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:44,127
Speaker 0: In the GameCube era, they experimented and they went toward their like sort of core, invested in Nintendo demographic.

382
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:48,061
Speaker 0: But yet, they also had the infinitely profitable mobile platform at the time.

383
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:56,328
Speaker 0: Then, in the Wii era, because they weren't doing so well, they had a rapid gear shift and they went toward the Blue Ocean strategy.

384
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,460
Speaker 1: Which made them a lot of money on Wii Sports.

385
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,084
Speaker 0: Wii Bowling.

386
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:01,868
Speaker 0: Not even Wii Sports.

387
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,415
Speaker 0: It was pretty much just Wii Bowling.

388
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,360
Speaker 1: And then also Wii Fit.

389
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:05,141
Speaker 0: Yeah.

390
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,955
Speaker 0: And then all those people didn't buy any other games.

391
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:09,778
Speaker 1: No, of course not.

392
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,285
Speaker 0: And certainly weren't going to buy a Wii U.

393
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:11,847
Speaker 1: No.

394
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:14,077
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, all the people like us said, "Yeah, fuck you

395
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:14,459
Speaker 0: guys.".

396
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:15,944
Speaker 0: So we left.

397
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:18,975
Speaker 0: So now they're floating out in the Blue Ocean alone.

398
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,745
Speaker 1: But Nintendo could easily please us people.

399
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:26,648
Speaker 1: If they would just make what I tell them, all of us would suddenly have to go and buy whatever they were selling.

400
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,215
Speaker 1: If they made the right game for it.

401
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,461
Speaker 0: I've said this so many times.

402
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:40,069
Speaker 0: If Nintendo did even a quarter, an eighth, a twentieth of what the Wii U controller is capable of, I would have bought that console in a heartbeat.

403
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:41,373
Speaker 0: But they haven't.

404
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,062
Speaker 0: They've done nothing with it.

405
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,633
Speaker 0: Just like they did nothing with the waggle.

406
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:51,787
Speaker 0: The last time they did anything was Four Swords and Crystal Chronicles with the GBA link cable.

407
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,470
Speaker 0: I gotta reach back for glory.

408
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:02,134
Speaker 0: And the greatest achievement in terms of proving an interesting path forward?

409
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,843
Speaker 0: Most people consider those games a failure.

410
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,870
Speaker 0: I think those people are wrong and kind of dumb.

411
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:11,539
Speaker 0: Tiny side news too.

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,611
Speaker 0: There's an article on Polygon that caught my eye a minute ago.

413
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,620
Speaker 0: Zelda fans debate Sheik's gender.

414
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,061
Speaker 1: What?

415
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,508
Speaker 1: It's Princess Zelda in disguise.

416
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:21,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, guys.

417
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,914
Speaker 0: It's Zelda in disguise.

418
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,541
Speaker 1: Have you not played Zelda 64?

419
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:33,566
Speaker 1: I think that the title can't be true because if you don't know that Sheik is Zelda in disguise, you're not a Zelda fan.

420
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,613
Speaker 1: He's not a real Zelda quote.

421
00:21:35,814 --> 00:21:39,425
Speaker 0: Sheik's gender is a surprisingly hot debate among Nintendo fans.

422
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:42,474
Speaker 1: Is Samus gender a debate as well?

423
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,076
Speaker 0: You know what?

424
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:45,645
Speaker 0: It was when I was a kid and there was no Internet.

425
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:50,602
Speaker 0: I remember when someone told me Samus Aaron was a girl and I said, "How do you

426
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:50,923
Speaker 0: know?".

427
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:58,766
Speaker 0: And the thing is they couldn't beat the game quickly enough to show me, so I didn't believe them until I went and found a picture of it.

428
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:08,056
Speaker 0: Is Sheik, the mysterious character first introduced in The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time, a man or a woman?

429
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:14,682
Speaker 0: The debate has begun again after Nintendo reveals that Sheik will be a playable character in the upcoming Hyrule Warriors.

430
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,932
Speaker 1: Have you played Smash Brothers?

431
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:19,597
Speaker 0: This article's amazing.

432
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:22,086
Speaker 1: You don't even have to have played Zelda 64 to know this.

433
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:31,082
Speaker 0: One person argues that, yes, it's Zelda, but it's Zelda dressing up as a man, therefore it's cross-dressing, blah, blah, blah, non-gender, binary, fluid, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, argument.

434
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:35,680
Speaker 0: Therefore, it's better if you argue that Sheik physically transformed into a man.

435
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,144
Speaker 0: So that's all fan garbage.

436
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:40,931
Speaker 0: At the bottom, the Polygon article.

437
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:42,155
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna read this.

438
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:51,640
Speaker 0: This is "Sheik asked Nintendo if there was an official word on this, and they answered the call.

439
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,260
Speaker 0: Nintendo's official line quoted from Nintendo's senior product marketing manager, Bill Trinen, is

440
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,262
Speaker 0: this.".

441
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:01,389
Speaker 1: Nintendo of America, not Nintendo of Japan?

442
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,260
Speaker 0: Uh, Bill Trinen, so I think Nintendo of America.

443
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:04,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

444
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,109
Speaker 0: I actually don't know which one he works for.

445
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,081
Speaker 1: He could have hired an English dude in Japan or vice versa.

446
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,187
Speaker 0: They could have, but I don't know.

447
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:10,012
Speaker 0: I don't know Bill Trinen.

448
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:10,535
Speaker 0: Anyway.

449
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,901
Speaker 0: I've heard the name, but I haven't.

450
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:12,122
Speaker 1: Anyway.

451
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:19,360
Speaker 0: Quote, "The definitive answer is that Sheik is a woman, simply Zelda, in a different

452
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,861
Speaker 0: outfit.".

453
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,742
Speaker 0: You don't say.

454
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:22,404
Speaker 0: You don't say.

455
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:23,245
Speaker 1: You don't say.

456
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,697
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

457
00:23:31,717 --> 00:23:35,283
Speaker 0: You know the old game, high five?

458
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:38,476
Speaker 0: Where you give someone a high five, and then you mess with them?

459
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:39,600
Speaker 1: You mean slap me high?

460
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

461
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:40,483
Speaker 1: Slap me low?

462
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,547
Speaker 0: Down low, too slow?

463
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,535
Speaker 1: Slap medium, slap me low, you too slow?

464
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:43,676
Speaker 0: Yep.

465
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:44,700
Speaker 0: All those kinds of things.

466
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:55,316
Speaker 0: The interaction in middle school, or possibly elementary school, where the cool kid does this to the not cool kid, and the not cool kid gets flustered, and it's hilarious.

467
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,042
Speaker 0: You know, that kind of thing.

468
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:01,874
Speaker 0: This video, I don't know what to say about it, but Mr.

469
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:09,512
Speaker 0: Ligandarius has presented an 18-second drama recorded entirely in vines of that experience.

470
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,917
Speaker 0: This is amazing.

471
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:16,127
Speaker 1: This is, we'll have to compete with my equally amazing thing of the day.

472
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:21,160
Speaker 1: Three words, Russian duck farmer.

473
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:22,985
Speaker 1: That's all I'm going to say.

474
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:23,828
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

475
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:26,458
Speaker 1: It's a tough choice between mine and yours.

476
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,582
Speaker 1: Excellent things of the day.

477
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:30,091
Speaker 1: Today, perhaps of great vintage.

478
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:33,743
Speaker 0: Perhaps we're back into the, we might be coming into a vintage year.

479
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:36,412
Speaker 0: No longer do we just go to College Humor.

480
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:38,459
Speaker 1: Those days are long past us.

481
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,471
Speaker 1: I haven't stopped going to College Humor, which is part of the reason.

482
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:45,014
Speaker 0: Thing is, as a result, I've been going to College Humor, and it's still consistently the best source of great videos.

483
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:45,395
Speaker 1: Probably.

484
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:45,857
Speaker 0: Yeah.

485
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,863
Speaker 1: Other meta moments.

486
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:50,533
Speaker 0: The Book Club book is The Canticle for Leibowitz.

487
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:53,242
Speaker 0: I'm hoping Scott will read it on the flight to Seattle.

488
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:54,385
Speaker 1: Maybe.

489
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:55,207
Speaker 1: It's too nice out.

490
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:57,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, too nice out on the plane flying to Seattle.

491
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,346
Speaker 1: I guess I recharged my Kindle.

492
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:07,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually just bought a, I found a book that purports to teach me Turkish.

493
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,196
Speaker 0: that's relatively new, so I bought it on the Kindle.

494
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:10,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try it out.

495
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,646
Speaker 1: We'll see how much Turkish you learn.

496
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:17,241
Speaker 0: I know more Turkish than most people in America who are not Turkish.

497
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,084
Speaker 1: You don't say.

498
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:21,736
Speaker 1: I know more Hebrew than most people in America.

499
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:23,923
Speaker 0: Those ducks know more Russian than any of us.

500
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,026
Speaker 1: That is true.

501
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:32,306
Speaker 0: We are giving away two fucking tickets, four-day tickets, fuckers, to PAX Prime 2014.

502
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:32,627
Speaker 0: Holy

503
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:38,347
Speaker 1: shit, if you want to go to PAX Prime 2014 and you can get there on your own, and you can find a place to stay on your

504
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:41,579
Speaker 0: own, and you can either give us your address or meet us at

505
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:50,212
Speaker 1: PAX, and for some reason you didn't get tickets because maybe you were lazy and didn't buy them, or you were just slow, or you're bad at internet, or whatever.

506
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,317
Speaker 1: You didn't listen to us.

507
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,329
Speaker 0: I can no longer blame people for being lazy or slow.

508
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:54,932
Speaker 1: I got them.

509
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:55,896
Speaker 1: How come you couldn't get them?

510
00:25:55,956 --> 00:26:01,615
Speaker 0: Scott and I saw that it went up at the same, like within seconds of each other.

511
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,401
Speaker 0: We both jumped into the queue.

512
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:08,855
Speaker 0: Scott bought as many four-day badges as he could, and I could not buy any.

513
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:11,382
Speaker 0: However, I got the good hotel.

514
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:14,653
Speaker 1: To get these two tickets, here's what you must do.

515
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:19,831
Speaker 1: You must tweet on Twitter and shamelessly self-promote us Geek Nights.

516
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:22,099
Speaker 1: We need promotion, so here's how it works.

517
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:22,701
Speaker 1: You make a tweet.

518
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:26,234
Speaker 1: The tweet must contain the hashtag of PAX.

519
00:26:26,274 --> 00:26:28,541
Speaker 1: That way people who are looking at that hashtag will see it.

520
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:33,555
Speaker 1: It must contain either the hashtag of Geek Nights or @GeekNights.

521
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:43,260
Speaker 1: If you use @GeekNights, do not make that the very first thing in the tweet, because then only we will see it, and other people who follow us and also follow you will see it, but no one else will see it.

522
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,852
Speaker 0: Thus defeating the purpose of shameless self-promotion.

523
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:50,764
Speaker 1: And it must contain a link to some sort of Geek Nights content.

524
00:26:50,864 --> 00:26:53,851
Speaker 1: It could be one of our panel videos on YouTube.

525
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:59,404
Speaker 1: It could be Geek episode, right?

526
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:11,480
Speaker 1: It could be anything that is us to promote us, and you make that tweet sometime before the tickets arrive at my house, and then if you make more than one tweet, it won't help you.

527
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,387
Speaker 1: It won't disqualify you, but it won't help you.

528
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,271
Speaker 1: One tweet is enough.

529
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:16,440
Speaker 1: More tweets are welcome.

530
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:21,114
Speaker 1: Tweet all you want, but only one entry per person.

531
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:29,395
Speaker 0: Because the more popular we get, I mean, we just spent like a thousand dollars on new microphones to do some awesome stuff, but we'll do that awesome stuff faster if you guys get us around more.

532
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:40,655
Speaker 1: And then on that day, uh, sometime soon, I will search all those tweets and use random.org to pick one of the Twitter accounts, and those two tickets will go to that person.

533
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:45,112
Speaker 1: If that person sells the tickets for money, you're a fucker and an asshole and a jerk.

534
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:49,610
Speaker 1: I won't be able to stop you, but I'll be hella pissed, and I'll put your name on the shit list.

535
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:51,658
Speaker 0: It's a short list, so watch out.

536
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,773
Speaker 1: If I give you the tickets, I want to see you at PAX, like at our panel and go, "Hey, what's

537
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:54,934
Speaker 1: up?".

538
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:55,376
Speaker 0: Yeah.

539
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,277
Speaker 0: So, in fact, if you come to our panel with those tickets, what panel would that be?

540
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,787
Speaker 0: That would be, oh, I gotta go to the older news, archive news.

541
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,457
Speaker 0: It is How to Win Every Game.

542
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:09,460
Speaker 1: Every game.

543
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:16,040
Speaker 0: The example games we list are games like Stratego, Settlers of Catan, or Football.

544
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,424
Speaker 0: We're not even joking.

545
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,086
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

546
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:22,896
Speaker 0: Noon Monday, Sandworm Theater.

547
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:24,240
Speaker 1: Sandworm Theater.

548
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,055
Speaker 0: So, if you get the badges and you come to that panel and say hi.

549
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,541
Speaker 1: Don't say the word Beetlejuice when you come.

550
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:34,588
Speaker 0: But bring spice, though.

551
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:38,374
Speaker 0: Can you think of a third Sandworm thing?

552
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:40,297
Speaker 0: No.

553
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:40,958
Speaker 0: Really?

554
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 0: Tremors?

555
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:42,948
Speaker 0: No tremors?

556
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,016
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell that is.

557
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:44,580
Speaker 0: Really?

558
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,207
Speaker 0: Scout doesn't know what tremors is.

559
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,213
Speaker 1: I don't know what you just said.

560
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:50,747
Speaker 0: What rock do you live on top of?

561
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:52,737
Speaker 0: Because if you lived under it, they would have gotten you by now.

562
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:53,200
Speaker 1: Long Island.

563
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,890
Speaker 0: So, beyond all that, oh, that's a bachelor party.

564
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,896
Speaker 0: Do I have any other stuff?

565
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:01,137
Speaker 0: Yes.

566
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:05,533
Speaker 0: We've started streaming and uploading videos of us playing tabletop games.

567
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:07,280
Speaker 0: So, a lot of you asked for that.

568
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:08,103
Speaker 0: We did it.

569
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,939
Speaker 0: If you liked it, spread it around, post it to Reddit, and we'll do more of it.

570
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,339
Speaker 0: That's a good way to get into the Geek Nights PAX Ticket Giveaway as well.

571
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,827
Speaker 0: So, Curse of the Necrodancer.

572
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,520
Speaker 1: So, this is a game I know has been coming for a long time.

573
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,144
Speaker 0: Played it at a PAX.

574
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:26,575
Speaker 1: I played it at a PAX like a minute, so it barely counts.

575
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:29,388
Speaker 0: They had, and I feel like, well, we'll talk about it.

576
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:38,104
Speaker 0: I feel like it was a little bit of disingenuous advertising, but they had it at PAX, and they had a dance pad set up, and there'd be people standing there dancing in front of the game.

577
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:38,545
Speaker 0: Yeah.

578
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:43,899
Speaker 1: So, this game, on paper, is a rhythm roguelike.

579
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,002
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

580
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,447
Speaker 1: DDR plus roguelike.

581
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:53,613
Speaker 0: You know, not just us, but people in general are big fans of the "What if you took Mega Man and mashed it up with

582
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:54,416
Speaker 0: football?".

583
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:58,131
Speaker 1: But, I mean, that particular combination is just so, well, there's Mega Man soccer.

584
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,700
Speaker 0: That's what I was about to make a joke about.

585
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:06,706
Speaker 1: That particular combination of roguelike and rhythm is just so, you can just imagine how amazing this game is going to be.

586
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:14,960
Speaker 1: Walking through a dungeon, equipping items, fighting really hard bad guys, but also funky music, excellent soundtrack, moving around, up, down, left, right.

587
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,463
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

588
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:16,328
Speaker 1: This has got to be the greatest.

589
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,601
Speaker 1: You play it for like a minute, and you're like, "Oh, my God.

590
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,223
Speaker 1: I can't believe

591
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:19,344
Speaker 1: it.".

592
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:24,460
Speaker 1: Finally, the pre-release of the game is on the Steam.

593
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,760
Speaker 0: Pre, pre, pre, pre-release, alpha, nowhere near done.

594
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,161
Speaker 1: Sure.

595
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,697
Speaker 1: It's nowhere near done, but it's actually more done than you would think.

596
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:36,116
Speaker 1: I think, like, the only thing that's missing is, like, final bosses and ending levels.

597
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:43,580
Speaker 0: It's got plenty of levels and there's tons- It's missing UI stuff and polish and a few tweaks to the core conceit.

598
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,328
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if it's ever going to get this.

599
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:46,434
Speaker 0: I don't think it will.

600
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:52,411
Speaker 1: But, regardless, we both played it, and let's talk about it.

601
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, Crypt of the NecroDancer is pretty fun.

602
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,362
Speaker 1: Great name.

603
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:57,186
Speaker 0: Yep.

604
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,009
Speaker 0: Great music.

605
00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:01,283
Speaker 1: I have a feeling- I mean, the music isn't the greatest rhythm music, but it's still great.

606
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:05,480
Speaker 0: The music reminds me so much of Super Hexagon's music.

607
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little bit.

608
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:12,286
Speaker 0: It's a little bit less- I don't know, but listen to it again without playing the game.

609
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:16,704
Speaker 0: But someone told me, and I haven't tried to do this, that you can just put any song in there.

610
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:19,394
Speaker 1: But it has to be the right rhythms.

611
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:19,996
Speaker 0: Hellorb.

612
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,681
Speaker 0: It'll figure out the beat, supposedly.

613
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,051
Speaker 0: So much Hellorb.

614
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:27,093
Speaker 1: Okay.

615
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:27,935
Speaker 1: Mr.

616
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:28,336
Speaker 1: Hellorb.

617
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:29,859
Speaker 0: I'm not Hellorb.

618
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:30,360
Speaker 0: You are.

619
00:31:32,342 --> 00:31:35,698
Speaker 0: So, basically, what it is, is it's a row-like where you play it in a rhythm.

620
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:42,543
Speaker 0: So, it's almost like a row-like where instead of just you move and then, like, the world's turn happens because you took your turn.

621
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,513
Speaker 0: Instead, turns happen every beat.

622
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:48,282
Speaker 1: So, if you stand still, bad guys keep moving on the beat.

623
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,213
Speaker 1: And you move on the beat.

624
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,737
Speaker 1: You don't have to move on the beat.

625
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,247
Speaker 1: You can't really move faster than the beat, right?

626
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:57,954
Speaker 1: So, ideally, you move on the beats.

627
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,063
Speaker 1: If you miss the beat, you don't really move.

628
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,805
Speaker 1: It's like, oops.

629
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:05,823
Speaker 0: Now, the game rewards you for continuing to move on the beat exactly.

630
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:07,370
Speaker 1: You get a coin multiplier.

631
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,312
Speaker 1: So, the coin multiplier basically means that when you kill guys, you're getting more and more monies, right?

632
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:16,611
Speaker 1: So, when you go to the shop, you can buy pretty much everything if you have your coin multiplier up.

633
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:17,515
Speaker 0: That's my problem.

634
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:19,483
Speaker 0: I kind of want to dwell on the bad stuff first.

635
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:24,662
Speaker 0: The problem with this game, fundamentally, is that the rhythm aspect of it matters very little.

636
00:32:24,703 --> 00:32:26,647
Speaker 0: That coin multiplier is it.

637
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,696
Speaker 0: Except in a few rare cases.

638
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:35,396
Speaker 0: Like when there's a shrine that you can activate and then you get hurt every time you miss the beat.

639
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:37,304
Speaker 0: But you know what happens when that happens?

640
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,447
Speaker 0: You just die.

641
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:43,383
Speaker 0: I mean, most of the games... So, yes, the rhythm multiplier would be cool.

642
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:46,112
Speaker 0: Except it only really is triggering when you have a fight.

643
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:51,632
Speaker 0: A good chunk of all the play is walking around a mostly empty level exploring.

644
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:55,907
Speaker 0: Staying on the rhythm during that time is boring and you're just gonna fuck it up.

645
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,637
Speaker 1: And it's just a steady rhythm, right?

646
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:03,254
Speaker 1: And it's not like you have to follow a particular pattern or hit different beats.

647
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:06,325
Speaker 1: It's just keep pushing the arrows at this rhythm.

648
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:11,020
Speaker 1: And different levels are... Later levels get faster and the rhythm is faster.

649
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:21,945
Speaker 1: And this is kind of good because if the game was turn-based, the way you fight the bad guys, it would be trivial because you could sit there and think about each and every move and figure out the optimal move.

650
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:28,350
Speaker 1: Because it makes you move fast, that's what makes you screw up because you don't have time to think and the bad guys are coming.

651
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:33,568
Speaker 1: But in terms of it, it needs a little more DDR going on here.

652
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:37,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I said in the early time when you see it set up and people are showing it off.

653
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:38,588
Speaker 1: It seems amazing.

654
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:42,604
Speaker 0: Because they have the dance pad out and you imagine it being a certain kind of thing.

655
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,011
Speaker 0: The dance pad is an afterthought.

656
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,123
Speaker 0: The dance pad does not really add to the game.

657
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:53,270
Speaker 1: It's a different control aspect and it also makes the game a lot harder which is why they have dance pad mode which is basically easy mode.

658
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:57,428
Speaker 0: But for example, Dance Dance Revolution, you're walking around the mat doing patterns.

659
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:03,668
Speaker 0: This game, you're mostly going left, left, left, left, left, right, left, left, left.

660
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,634
Speaker 0: It's really fucking tedious.

661
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:09,286
Speaker 0: You can't even just leave your foot down to keep going left.

662
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:10,069
Speaker 0: You have to keep tap.

663
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,667
Speaker 0: So it's basically tap with your foot on a really inefficient bullshit controller.

664
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:18,621
Speaker 1: As opposed to DDR which is like up, down, jump, both, left, left, left, right.

665
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:27,145
Speaker 0: If the game had like combos like do a rhythm to cast a spell or a particular dance to do a thing.

666
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:30,138
Speaker 1: All the items that you cast are basically two buttons at once.

667
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,853
Speaker 1: So it'll tell you on the screen like for bomb, go down and left simultaneously.

668
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:38,052
Speaker 1: So if you're using a game pad, you can't use the D-pad or the analog stick.

669
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:41,587
Speaker 1: You have to use the four buttons on the right to control the game.

670
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:42,792
Speaker 0: Or bind a combo button.

671
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:43,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, which sucks.

672
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,900
Speaker 1: You don't want to do that.

673
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, now what I would have done is made the game more like eighth note patterns.

674
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,387
Speaker 0: So on the beats, you move and do the normal game.

675
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:57,674
Speaker 0: But if I want to use a potion, I should have to be like up left on an eighth note pattern to use the item instead.

676
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,763
Speaker 0: That would have been cool but they don't do anything like that.

677
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:05,147
Speaker 1: Now the other thing is the bad guys in this game, each bad guy has his own pattern of movement and attacking.

678
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,180
Speaker 1: So you can learn each bad guy in the way to approach them.

679
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,049
Speaker 1: For example, there's a green slime.

680
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,360
Speaker 1: All you got to do is walk up and bump into it to kill it.

681
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,022
Speaker 1: Pretty easy.

682
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:14,668
Speaker 1: There's a blue slime.

683
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,294
Speaker 1: The blue slime only moves up and down.

684
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:19,228
Speaker 1: To kill him, you have to hit him from the left or the right.

685
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:21,762
Speaker 1: If you approach him from the top or the bottom, he's probably going to hit you.

686
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:23,951
Speaker 1: Unless you get your timing really right.

687
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:27,648
Speaker 1: And then you know bosses and stuff come at you in even harder ways.

688
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:36,044
Speaker 1: So it's like when the dragon comes, it's like you have to step away from the dragon, then step back at it, then hit it, then step away and go at it and hit it and so on.

689
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:38,676
Speaker 1: It's like there's more complicated things you have to do.

690
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:48,435
Speaker 1: There's a ghost that's like boo and he follows you around invisible but then you turn it and you got to turn around right when he's just behind you to get him to appear and stab him, right?

691
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:49,940
Speaker 1: And you have to do this on the rhythm.

692
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:58,233
Speaker 1: So when there's a room full of a bunch of different bad guys and you have to keep moving, it's not the easiest to think of like the exact right patterns.

693
00:35:58,273 --> 00:36:02,912
Speaker 1: Like you can focus on one guy and then another guy is going to come over and kill you like the big dragon or something.

694
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:14,497
Speaker 1: So you know the rhythm is good and then it forces you to, because if you could just sit there and think and assess all the bad guys and how they move, it would be trivially trivial and dumb.

695
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:18,114
Speaker 1: You would never get hit and never die because you'd always be able to make the right move.

696
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:23,192
Speaker 0: And I enjoy this that aspect of it a lot because it is not even analogous to DDR.

697
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:24,477
Speaker 0: It's not even the same realm.

698
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:29,291
Speaker 0: It's just a you don't have time to think roguelike.

699
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:34,347
Speaker 0: The other problem I have with the game is that it does a very poor job of Mega Man X-ing.

700
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:38,518
Speaker 0: It does not tell you fuck all about what things do.

701
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:43,718
Speaker 0: but in rogue and roguelikes that's fine because you sit there and think like I do a thing.

702
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,565
Speaker 0: What the fuck did that weird thing do?

703
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:52,570
Speaker 0: In this game because it's moving so fast, unless you read a fact, you will never know how the weapons actually work.

704
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,785
Speaker 1: The only way to learn anything is to learn the bad guy movements.

705
00:36:56,825 --> 00:37:00,083
Speaker 1: They have a little training mode where you can go and practice against all the different bad guys.

706
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:03,418
Speaker 1: You have to unlock the guy who does that for you by playing.

707
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,653
Speaker 1: And there's another one where you can unlock bosses to practice against them.

708
00:37:06,673 --> 00:37:09,245
Speaker 1: To unlock that you need to get diamonds and shit.

709
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:18,383
Speaker 1: So it's like you can't get the practice mode to learn the game for the different bad guys and their movements until you get kind of far in the game and have probably beaten those guys.

710
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:30,162
Speaker 0: And also a lot of the game is very unrhythmic in the sense that the patterns of the monsters are sort of mitigated by the fact that you can dig up pretty much any wall.

711
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:40,662
Speaker 0: So the game is very open and you spend a lot of time backtracking through empty areas which is super boring especially because you've got your coin combo going and you want to just keep it going.

712
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:51,156
Speaker 0: So you got to be like left, left and follow the rhythm perfectly and then you'll a lot of backtracking through boring empty areas even in harder higher levels.

713
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:55,632
Speaker 1: I think part of the game is sort of trying to be like spelunky in a way.

714
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,920
Speaker 0: Yeah it reminded me a lot of spelunky.

715
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,394
Speaker 1: Where it's like okay the stages are kind of small right.

716
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:02,680
Speaker 1: They're sort of randomly generated.

717
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,890
Speaker 1: They have a few areas and a few aspects in common.

718
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,000
Speaker 1: There's always a shop with some random items.

719
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:17,456
Speaker 1: There's always going to be certain numbers of rooms with bad guys and a treasure chest maybe and maybe a key and you know it's like okay do you just rush for the exit?

720
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,303
Speaker 1: Do you try to beat all the bad guys?

721
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:30,503
Speaker 1: Do you you know try to get certain items and things you know and it's like doesn't have as much stuff as spelunking but it has bombs which spelunky has and it also has the shop and whatever.

722
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:33,776
Speaker 1: So you know I think they're hoping that you know.

723
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,524
Speaker 1: people are going to try to do the same thing with this.

724
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:48,635
Speaker 1: they did with spelunky like trying to perfect it trying to unlock secret stuffs trying to do easter eggs speed runs all that sort of stuff which you could do that with this game but it wouldn't be as good as spelunky until a lot more is added.

725
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:52,427
Speaker 1: Spelunky is mad polished after being released on like a zillion different platforms.

726
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:57,744
Speaker 0: So I don't know this game like if I had to say in some.

727
00:38:57,784 --> 00:38:58,808
Speaker 0: now it's not done yet.

728
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:05,856
Speaker 0: I don't think and I think you agreed when you hinted this earlier it's never going to get the the highest level of polish like.

729
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:06,880
Speaker 0: I don't see that happening.

730
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,467
Speaker 1: There's no way it's like.

731
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:17,101
Speaker 1: unless they keep working on this thing for years which I don't see happening it's not going to reach like the spelunky level but it's definitely going to be better than it is now.

732
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:22,235
Speaker 1: but I don't see them changing the core conceit and adding more rhythmness to it.

733
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:39,371
Speaker 0: So if I had my dream game it would be a game where you hold a controller to move around and you dance on a dance pad to do things like almost like robotron controls but it's moving with the hands and casting spells by doing complex combos with the feet.

734
00:39:39,793 --> 00:40:01,593
Speaker 1: What I would actually like to make is a pure rhythm game where it's just ddr but the visualization of the game right you know like when you're playing regular ddr the visualization just the arrows yeah and the guy dancing in the right and and you can see him going through the dungeon.

735
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:08,517
Speaker 1: and as long as you keep hitting perfect the guy goes through the dungeon nicely and if you you know mess up playing ddr.

736
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:10,244
Speaker 1: the visualization is not so good.

737
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:12,273
Speaker 1: you get hit when you make a mistake.

738
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:13,900
Speaker 0: oh you don't even have to be a visualization.

739
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,964
Speaker 0: imagine going between the two.

740
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:24,138
Speaker 0: imagine if the the dungeon in one of these levels in this game was very linear and you're playing it and the enemy's patterns are all sort of.

741
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:25,724
Speaker 0: basically you have to the pattern.

742
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:26,527
Speaker 0: that's perfect.

743
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:28,193
Speaker 0: there's no like empty spaces.

744
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:32,391
Speaker 0: you're just going through stuff monsters and the dance pattern is always the same.

745
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:36,728
Speaker 0: don't make it randomly generated necessarily and you've got to just like play perfectly through it.

746
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,962
Speaker 0: but also you know what it doesn't do anything with you.

747
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:42,167
Speaker 0: either get the rhythm or you don't.

748
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,637
Speaker 0: there's no like gradation there.

749
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:54,304
Speaker 0: what if every day if you hit the rhythm so perfectly like the perfect in ddr you got like a 1.1 to x damage got a good.

750
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:57,537
Speaker 0: maybe it's 0.8 x damage like it doesn't do anything like that?

751
00:40:57,557 --> 00:40:58,340
Speaker 0: i don't think it ever will.

752
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,344
Speaker 1: hmm that would be good.

753
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,000
Speaker 1: yeah there's a lot of this and the rhythm is always steady right on the beats.

754
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,833
Speaker 1: there's some things that'll speed it up and slow it down sure but within a single level the rhythm doesn't change unless you fall into a trap or something that messes with it.

755
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:16,231
Speaker 1: why not have the rhythm actually follow like the melody a bit right so it.

756
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:24,578
Speaker 1: you know the game would be like move move move move move move move move move instead of move move move move move move.

757
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:32,011
Speaker 1: you know it would be a lot more interesting that way because you know you had to sort of sit around in the opening part of the game get a feel for the song.

758
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,461
Speaker 1: you know there would be certain times like you'd be like all right.

759
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:38,419
Speaker 1: wait for the bunch of movement then approach the room full of bad guys on this beat.

760
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:53,600
Speaker 0: you might get caught by surprise when the suddenly you know there's a there's an awesome does have pretty good co-op in the sense that you just play together and it's actually really fun.

761
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:59,125
Speaker 1: but if you get to the edge of the map you're sort of stuck yep and it doesn't do any split screen or anything interesting.

762
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:07,040
Speaker 0: and if you die well fuck you just sit there and wait for your friend to beat the level or die and the game over because it's a roguelike you're dead you're dead.

763
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:20,868
Speaker 1: yep i'd say it has a bit of the rogue legacy though where when you die any diamonds you got other things don't matter but any diamonds you got can be used in the lobby to buy stuff but if you don't use them you lose them.

764
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:25,001
Speaker 1: so you can't build up diamonds over time sort of like rogue legacy.

765
00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:39,227
Speaker 1: yeah uh and you can use that to buy things in the shops that either you know put items into chests in the dungeon to make the chest better or permanent upgrades like more heart containers just period stuff like that.

766
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:44,926
Speaker 0: so if i had to rate this game in terms of fun it's about the same level as the binding of isaac?

767
00:42:45,408 --> 00:42:46,713
Speaker 1: yeah by the same level.

768
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:51,732
Speaker 0: it's the kind of idle game that i like playing my laptop with my fingers while i'm waiting for an airplane.

769
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:53,558
Speaker 1: it's not an ftl level.

770
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,775
Speaker 0: yeah uh speaking of which i've been playing a lot of ftl.

771
00:42:56,795 --> 00:43:00,804
Speaker 1: still you don't say people were talking.

772
00:43:00,824 --> 00:43:07,688
Speaker 1: i heard some rumblings right not of anything actually happening in terms of an official thing but just you know fan made.

773
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,058
Speaker 1: they were typing in fan made ftl board game.

774
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:13,427
Speaker 0: but also i've been talking about that.

775
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,877
Speaker 0: i've started prototyping an ftl board game.

776
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:22,476
Speaker 1: someone else is talking fan made ftl tabletop rpg using torchbearer ish kind of rules.

777
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:23,378
Speaker 0: yeah that would be.

778
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,006
Speaker 0: that would be the fucking bomb.

779
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:27,981
Speaker 0: that's what i'm saying especially because then you take those like the care.

780
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,267
Speaker 1: would it be the fire bomb?

781
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,476
Speaker 0: you take the character sheet inventory tetris.

782
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:33,825
Speaker 1: i'll be i'll be mantis man and you couple it.

783
00:43:33,865 --> 00:43:37,980
Speaker 0: you can be stone man but you couple it with the ship's inventory tetris.

784
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:41,573
Speaker 0: yep oh my god there's so many possibilities there.

785
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:42,517
Speaker 1: i'm mantis man.

786
00:43:42,677 --> 00:43:43,280
Speaker 1: that's all i'm saying.

787
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:47,933
Speaker 0: you really have to read more culture books scott.

788
00:43:47,953 --> 00:43:49,320
Speaker 0: that's all i'm gonna say this mantis man.

789
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:50,224
Speaker 0: uh i'm just.

790
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:51,570
Speaker 0: there's so many things.

791
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:54,182
Speaker 1: i'm sure if you're in the culture you can just become a mantis man.

792
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:55,226
Speaker 0: who's gonna stop you?

793
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:57,434
Speaker 0: there's that guy who he's he?

794
00:43:57,514 --> 00:44:00,264
Speaker 0: he's the ambassador to the species called the affront.

795
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:01,548
Speaker 1: they're mantises.

796
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,497
Speaker 0: no they're just the worst but he's like.

797
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:07,951
Speaker 0: he kind of likes them even though they're the worst and he's kind of like me.

798
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,156
Speaker 1: are they worse than azad?

799
00:44:09,177 --> 00:44:12,344
Speaker 0: uh you have no idea.

800
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:14,209
Speaker 1: that's why i'm asking.

801
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,756
Speaker 0: that's pretty tame compared to the affront.

802
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:17,498
Speaker 0: are?

803
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:22,695
Speaker 0: i'll put it this way they were found by the like normal civilizations.

804
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:30,798
Speaker 0: the big guys and they were like you motherfuckers are an affront to existence and this civilization liked that name so much.

805
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:32,664
Speaker 0: they adopted it as their own name.

806
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:39,927
Speaker 0: awesome and this culture guy's like kind of want to become an affronter and everyone else is like what the fuck is wrong with you.

807
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:43,178
Speaker 0: but there's mantis men too.

808
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:45,024
Speaker 0: yeah mantis man they're not that they.

809
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:48,880
Speaker 1: uh they're not that great mantis men in ftl though are the best.

810
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:52,272
Speaker 0: i'm more a fan of a bunch of rock men to be honest.

811
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:53,779
Speaker 1: uh all right let's get in a fight.

812
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,025
Speaker 1: you're mantis man you're rock man.

813
00:44:55,045 --> 00:44:56,853
Speaker 0: i just got my mantis man all right.

814
00:44:56,873 --> 00:44:58,841
Speaker 0: fine you know what rock man mantis man.

815
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:01,088
Speaker 0: i'll just cut the oxygen in the room.

816
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:02,152
Speaker 0: that's fine.

817
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:04,540
Speaker 1: we're fighting inside my med bay on my ship.

818
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:14,337
Speaker 0: yeah you should play ftl advance because one thing you can start as is the mantis ship that doesn't really have a lot of weapons and you just teleport guys over and fuck shit up.

819
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,708
Speaker 0: yes the whole game is killing people.

820
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:22,795
Speaker 1: yes but then you get it's so much easier if you can board people because then you get to steal their ship and upgrade really fast.

821
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:25,367
Speaker 0: the game's an easy mode and then you get some anti-bio beams.

822
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:29,082
Speaker 0: you're also shooting deadly stuff at their ship but that doesn't hurt mantis.

823
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:30,306
Speaker 1: men it's good times.

824
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:35,641
Speaker 0: so uh yeah hopefully we'll keep doing shows right up until packs.

825
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:42,360
Speaker 0: but uh the week of packs there's gonna be no shows at all because if you don't live in the u.s.

826
00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:48,045
Speaker 1: this is labor day weekend which is a holiday you don't know about but it's always the first weekend of september.

827
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,719
Speaker 1: so we're going to rim's gonna be going to packs like way earlier than me.

828
00:45:51,739 --> 00:46:02,852
Speaker 0: me and emily are flying out to packs on tuesday because we're going to packs dev first then scott's joining us we're all going to the sky high tabletop charity as vips and then we're going not because we're actually vips but just because we paid for that.

829
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:07,953
Speaker 0: yes you realize most people who are vips paid for that or are friends with people who run whatever.

830
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:08,555
Speaker 0: that is.

831
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,422
Speaker 0: yeah in a general sense not this thing.

832
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:13,531
Speaker 0: just in general vip means money or nepotism.

833
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:20,689
Speaker 0: in this case money yes and then packs for four days and then we're flying back like the tuesday after pack.

834
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:27,165
Speaker 0: so we're gonna be gone for a is like tomorrow i think.

835
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:29,373
Speaker 0: uh-huh i'm going to pack sauce.

836
00:46:29,814 --> 00:46:33,372
Speaker 1: okay i don't know if scott is so i don't think it's gonna happen like yeah i'm gonna go somewhere else.

837
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,620
Speaker 0: should we kick start you going?

838
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,250
Speaker 1: someone else gives me a whole pile of money.

839
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,863
Speaker 0: i'll just why did you just kick start like you going and doing the panels?

840
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,452
Speaker 1: because that's not a thing you can kick start.

841
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:42,136
Speaker 1: yes it is.

842
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,462
Speaker 1: you do it then i'm not doing it.

843
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:44,565
Speaker 0: the result of the kick start?

844
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,290
Speaker 0: well i i can just pay to go.

845
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:49,320
Speaker 1: you you kick start me going.

846
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:50,203
Speaker 0: why would i do that?

847
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:54,156
Speaker 0: i'll kick start me going and i'll just pocket that money.

848
00:46:54,176 --> 00:47:00,319
Speaker 1: if anyone's just mad rich living in australia and you got money to burn send me some monies and maybe i'll go.

849
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:03,451
Speaker 0: the good news is as a result i submitted a panel that i've always.

850
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:04,435
Speaker 0: we did it.

851
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:05,439
Speaker 0: we never videoed it.

852
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,074
Speaker 0: i thought it was a great lecture so i rewrote it and i want to do it again.

853
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,560
Speaker 0: scott wants nothing to do with this.

854
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:12,125
Speaker 0: so that's what i'm hoping to do.

855
00:47:12,186 --> 00:47:12,808
Speaker 0: a pack sauce.

856
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:13,932
Speaker 0: great it's.

857
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:15,257
Speaker 0: the losing should be fun.

858
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:16,663
Speaker 1: uh you and your losing should be fun.

859
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:18,712
Speaker 0: i think that was one of our better better lectures.

860
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:24,016
Speaker 0: i think it was way better than the other unvideoed one the egregiously unrealized potential.

861
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:27,969
Speaker 0: that one was not good that one was better than money-making games.

862
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:34,812
Speaker 0: i think maybe i like that one because it was basically the end was 20 minutes of us going contento.

863
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:37,482
Speaker 1: what the fuck the thing we just did just now.

864
00:47:37,662 --> 00:47:45,809
Speaker 0: yes also that was the one where we got to talk a lot about how bionic commander rearmed was the true sequel and the actual sequel failed.

865
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:47,976
Speaker 1: everyone knows that.

866
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:50,165
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't seem to know what happened there.

867
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,615
Speaker 0: yeah i remember we pulled up the sales figures.

868
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:53,700
Speaker 0: the audience was like what.

869
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:57,223
Speaker 0: so yeah see you guys at packs.
