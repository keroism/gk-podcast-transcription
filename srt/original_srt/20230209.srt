1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,228
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, February 9th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:10,409
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:14,057
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,759
Speaker 1: And this is the Geek Nights Book Club!

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,300
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about Scott's most recent choice, Alif the Unseen.

6
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,148
Speaker 0: It was your choice.

7
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:23,300
Speaker 0: I gave you two options.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,813
Speaker 1: Ah, it was your choice, and then I had the meta choice.

9
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:28,360
Speaker 1: It was you cut, and I chose.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,250
Speaker 0: Yeah.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,340
Speaker 1: So Alif the Unseen by G. Willow Wilson.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Speaker 0: It's my cut and your choice.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, so why'd you pick it again?

14
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:42,318
Speaker 1: Because I remember we had a good conversation when we launched this one about like why we're picking this author in particular with Ms.

15
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:42,640
Speaker 1: Marvel.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:51,319
Speaker 0: Right, so what happened, yeah, so what happened was I was like well I got to pick some book club books, right, and I got to pick two, and I will cut two, and Rym will choose one of the two.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,249
Speaker 0: So I go to my Amazon wish list, which even if I don't buy the books on Amazon, I just use Amazon wish list.

18
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:03,087
Speaker 0: And whenever I see a book on the internet and I say I want to read that book, I don't buy it because that's a mistake.

19
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:09,762
Speaker 0: I'll add it to my wish list, and then if there comes a time where I'm actually going to read it immediately, then I'll buy it and start reading it right away.

20
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:15,563
Speaker 0: So I went to the wish list and said are there any books in here that are going to be good for the book club?

21
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:20,699
Speaker 0: And by complete coincidence, I noticed two of the books on.

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,830
Speaker 0: there were from the same author, an author I had never heard of.

23
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:29,675
Speaker 0: And I was like what are the odds that some author I've never heard of gets two books, two different books.

24
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:37,960
Speaker 0: In fact, I think they're only two books, at least they're only two like novels, onto my wish list separately.

25
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,991
Speaker 1: Right, that are not in a series.

26
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:45,147
Speaker 1: Like the Wheel of Time wouldn't have counted, like Prince of Nothing books don't count.

27
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:52,158
Speaker 0: I added them months or years apart, so it wasn't like I. at one point in time I like recognized the author and added all their books.

28
00:01:52,238 --> 00:02:01,008
Speaker 0: It was like one book came up at some point and into my, you know, notice and was added to the wish list, and then sometime later the other book.

29
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,315
Speaker 0: So I'm like well that's a sign.

30
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:14,190
Speaker 0: So I look up information about the author G. Willow Wilson and I find out that they are a famous comic book writer, even though I haven't personally read many.

31
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,499
Speaker 0: any of their comic, you know, book works.

32
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,486
Speaker 0: They've, you know, they've done a lot of famous stuff.

33
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,579
Speaker 0: Like, you know, the newer Ms.

34
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,255
Speaker 0: Marvel, they basically invented that character, which is a big deal, right?

35
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,087
Speaker 0: It got really popular, even though I never read any of it.

36
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:31,381
Speaker 0: They've won, you know, they got some Eisner action going on, right?

37
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,146
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's a big deal.

38
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:39,765
Speaker 0: comic book person and writer for many years and they had two novels and I'm like.

39
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:45,863
Speaker 0: well this seems like a significant person in the the nerd literature world, right?

40
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,671
Speaker 0: Fantasy sci-fi superhero biz.

41
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:50,716
Speaker 0: Let's check this out.

42
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:55,995
Speaker 0: and I was like and conveniently they've written two books for me to offer Rim to choose from, right?

43
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:58,423
Speaker 0: Oh well, you know, it's like it just lands in the lap.

44
00:02:58,463 --> 00:02:59,726
Speaker 0: Such an easy go.

45
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:17,062
Speaker 0: So Rim chose the older of the two novels Leaf the Unseen, which is basically a middle eastern sort of, you know, magical realism, cyberpunk kind of deal, right?

46
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,711
Speaker 0: Which is like a great new combination.

47
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,922
Speaker 0: You can't find any fault in that combination whatsoever.

48
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:26,093
Speaker 0: That's a recipe, you know, the recipe was for greatness, right?

49
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:29,828
Speaker 0: But we hadn't yet tasted the the dish, right?

50
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:33,502
Speaker 0: We saw the ingredients and we said well that's going to be amazing, right?

51
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:38,622
Speaker 0: Just based on the ingredients alone and the name of the chef and other things the chef had done.

52
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:44,040
Speaker 0: We're like well that's going to be great and we ate the meal at this point finally.

53
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,650
Speaker 1: It was a pretty, it was a solid meal.

54
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,016
Speaker 1: I've enjoyed it, like I enjoyed it.

55
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,060
Speaker 1: I got a lot to say about it.

56
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:57,124
Speaker 0: And also this person is basically the exact same age as us, so we have a shared, you know, uh, you know.

57
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:01,701
Speaker 1: Their Wikipedia is great too because it's not long, but I'm gonna read a short quote from it.

58
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:07,344
Speaker 1: Wilson first encountered comics when she read an anti-smoking pamphlet featuring the x-men in fifth grade.

59
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:08,910
Speaker 1: I feel like I read that same pamphlet.

60
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:12,206
Speaker 0: I don't know if I read that one, but I've definitely seen.

61
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:16,606
Speaker 1: The characters fascinated her and she began watching the cartoon x-men every Saturday.

62
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,309
Speaker 1: The one we watched.

63
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,849
Speaker 0: I can say that the first time I ever saw the x-men was actually a coloring book.

64
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,189
Speaker 0: that wasn't even my, it was someone else's coloring book that they had already colored in that that they gave to me.

65
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,675
Speaker 0: They only, right?

66
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:30,839
Speaker 0: And it was like x-men.

67
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,467
Speaker 0: and I'm like who the, what the hell is x-men?

68
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:33,291
Speaker 0: I was like I don't know.

69
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:42,215
Speaker 1: I was aware of the x-men because my uncle and my mom were like into comics, but like as a kid I didn't really read them or think about them, but then when I was young we got an x-men board game.

70
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:55,719
Speaker 1: The one that came with all those miniatures and it came with a random issue of the x-men, but it was like a floppy that was between two story arcs and didn't make any sense because it had no context and nothing happened.

71
00:04:55,739 --> 00:05:00,480
Speaker 1: It was just like Beast talking to somewhat to like Cyclops in an abandoned building the whole time.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically the x-men in that comic book were like the the the x-factor style with like.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,887
Speaker 0: it was that era, right?

74
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,600
Speaker 0: So it was kind of old and I was like it wasn't very appealing.

75
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:18,980
Speaker 0: But then, you know, once, you know, when I got into x-men was when everyone else got into x-men, right?

76
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:25,823
Speaker 0: When there was Jim Lee, Adjectiveless X-Men number one, the arcade game and the cartoon, right?

77
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:29,835
Speaker 1: That cartoon, that got me, that made me an x-men fan.

78
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:34,986
Speaker 1: That was very successful despite the fact that that cartoon, not that good.

79
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:36,869
Speaker 0: That cartoon is great.

80
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,677
Speaker 0: All right, let's talk about Alif the Unseen.

81
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,186
Speaker 1: All right, so it's the GeekNuts Book Club.

82
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:47,997
Speaker 1: So if you've never listened to the GeekNuts Book Club before, just to remind you or to share with you, one, it's a book club, meaning we all read the book.

83
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,203
Speaker 1: We're assuming you read the book.

84
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:55,176
Speaker 1: So if you did not read this book, you're going to have no fucking idea what we're talking about because we're not going to explain everything that happened in the book.

85
00:05:55,477 --> 00:06:00,197
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about it assuming just to fully summarize the broad, the broad stroke.

86
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,958
Speaker 1: And two, obviously we're going to spoil stuff because we read the book and the whole point is talk about the book.

87
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:05,922
Speaker 0: Yep.

88
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:19,968
Speaker 0: And if you, if you read the book, come to the places that we exist on the internet, which is our forum and our discord server and, you know, discuss, discuss the book with other people who also read the book.

89
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,998
Speaker 0: Hopefully we're the only ones reading it.

90
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:22,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

91
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:23,626
Speaker 1: Talk about the book with us.

92
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,897
Speaker 1: Cause there, there's some, it was a pretty good book overall.

93
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,889
Speaker 1: It wasn't the best written thing I've ever read.

94
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:31,143
Speaker 1: Uh, it's a little awkward in a few times.

95
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:35,904
Speaker 1: I'd say about a third of the computer scenes are plausible and two thirds of them are implausible.

96
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:36,004
Speaker 1: Yeah.

97
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,041
Speaker 0: I'm not, I'm not concerned about the plausible, right?

98
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:45,712
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I always complain when other nerds, I mean, I understand that feeling cause I've had it at times, right?

99
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:50,175
Speaker 0: I mean, they made us watch, I always say they made us watch the net in high school, like, Oh my God.

100
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:57,602
Speaker 0: Um, but it's like, you know, if you're going to sit there and complain, they're like, Oh, the computer part wasn't real.

101
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,570
Speaker 0: And therefore that ruined the whole thing for me.

102
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,354
Speaker 0: And it's like, I guess you're only gonna ever watch the hardest of sci-fis and don't watch any star wars.

103
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:08,024
Speaker 1: You're only going to watch things that you don't know shit about.

104
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:09,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

105
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:19,399
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if you w you can watch some movie about, uh, cooking and you don't know shit about cooking and then it's like, there'll be everything's wrong in it, but it doesn't bother you because you don't know anything about it.

106
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,820
Speaker 0: So it's like, so if I see bad computer stuff, it's like, I don't get hung up on it.

107
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,806
Speaker 0: I'm like, well, what I guess I would say is if I'm going to be hung up on that, how am I going to feel about the genies?

108
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:29,268
Speaker 0: Right.

109
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,051
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

110
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:43,290
Speaker 1: But I said implausible and not bad because they fit into the implausible parts didn't get in the way at all because the story worked perfectly with the way they were portrayed.

111
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:50,400
Speaker 1: And obviously they were highly abstracted in the same way that like wizard magic is highly abstracted in most non prince of nothing books.

112
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:51,343
Speaker 0: Yep.

113
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:57,748
Speaker 0: It's even, it's even somewhat abstracted in those, but yeah, but it talks a lot more about that anyway.

114
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,535
Speaker 0: So, all right, so let us do that.

115
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:03,211
Speaker 0: The brief, very broad brush summary of what goes on in this book, right?

116
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,400
Speaker 0: Is this guy named Alif, right?

117
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,175
Speaker 1: Who I thought was a lot younger than I realized he was later in the book.

118
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,821
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess he's, I always, he's like a college type person, I thought he was like 17, 18, but no, he was like 21, 22.

119
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:16,103
Speaker 1: Yeah.

120
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,371
Speaker 0: He's not, he's not in college though.

121
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:20,601
Speaker 0: Uh, he's living with his, you know, family.

122
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:22,169
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess it's not his dad.

123
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,917
Speaker 0: His dad is some like deadbeat dad who's far away kinda.

124
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:30,475
Speaker 0: But anyway, he's living in sort of, uh, it doesn't actually like name a country.

125
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:36,318
Speaker 1: I don't think it's specifically left vague and unnamed on purpose, but other real countries are named like.

126
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:37,563
Speaker 1: Egypt is clearly nearby.

127
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:45,734
Speaker 1: Like the rest of the real world exists, but they do not tell you where this is specifically on purpose, probably to avoid difficulty in drama.

128
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:46,197
Speaker 0: Yeah.

129
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:49,473
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of it is based on like, you know, Arab spring, right?

130
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,543
Speaker 0: That happened was a great inspiration for this book.

131
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,110
Speaker 1: I mean, the book was published in 2012.

132
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,656
Speaker 0: That was a lot of that was in Egypt.

133
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:56,844
Speaker 0: It was like the center was in Egypt.

134
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,145
Speaker 0: Right.

135
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:03,131
Speaker 0: And, um, you know, but basically it's in a city in the middle of a desert, you know, I guess near some water, I think.

136
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:19,212
Speaker 0: But the, the city has like different districts sort of representing and, you know, all the different sort of aspects of, you know, you've got in one district, you've got like these really wealthy, you know, uh, people that sort of reminds you of like, you know, royalty from Saudi Arabia.

137
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:19,994
Speaker 1: Yeah.

138
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:26,113
Speaker 1: Big Saudi or UAE vibes in terms of how it was portrayed and like what kinds of places were shown.

139
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:26,997
Speaker 1: Yeah.

140
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:44,180
Speaker 0: And then you've got, you know, another district that feels more like, you know, uh, you know, where the not so wealthy people live sort of like if you watch, you know, Disney's Aladdin, like, you know, the market area at the start, you know, and then you got sort of like a outskirts places, right.

141
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,250
Speaker 0: You know, um, there's like a prison off to the north area.

142
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:51,369
Speaker 0: It is a map in the book because it's a fantasy book and all good fantasy books have a map.

143
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:51,670
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

144
00:09:51,891 --> 00:10:00,228
Speaker 1: But then you got a leaf who is living a lot of teenage nerd internet people's dream of.

145
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:04,004
Speaker 1: he's actually a pretty good like hacker type person.

146
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:10,868
Speaker 1: And then he's basically running null soft waste for anyone who has a beef with the government anywhere in the middle East.

147
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,550
Speaker 0: Right.

148
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:20,596
Speaker 0: So a leaf doesn't seem to have a strong, like he doesn't take sides in like the, the big cultural, you know, battles that are happening.

149
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:25,109
Speaker 0: His side is simply only like anti-authoritarian only.

150
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:25,390
Speaker 0: Right.

151
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:34,564
Speaker 0: So it's like, he's, you know, uh, providing service and his clients, like if his clients knew who each other were, like they might even hate each other.

152
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:34,745
Speaker 0: Right.

153
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:38,355
Speaker 0: He's serving all the, doesn't skirt around.

154
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:44,460
Speaker 1: Like at the end, it kind of comes back together and reminds everyone like, yeah, a lot of the people leaf with helping are not great people.

155
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:45,463
Speaker 0: No.

156
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:55,134
Speaker 0: Um, but you know, a leaf is what he's doing is basically helping people avoid like the big brother eye of the government on the internet kind of right.

157
00:10:55,174 --> 00:11:10,687
Speaker 0: He's like providing the, you know, it's concealed internet services that the, you know, very much, uh, you know, surveillance society is, you know, normal people are being surveilled in an almost China like way in this society.

158
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:18,815
Speaker 1: You have to imagine that there's also some religious police and he's running a deniably encrypted like file transfer chat and voice network.

159
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:26,243
Speaker 1: Basically like people can communicate, coordinate think telegram plus null soft waste plus a couple other things kind of rolled in together.

160
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:32,690
Speaker 0: And he's also sort of, you know, he's, he's constantly protecting it from, you know, the event, the attacks from the outside.

161
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,112
Speaker 0: Right.

162
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:36,187
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not just like a, it's like, it's not a. set it and forget it deal.

163
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:36,469
Speaker 0: Right.

164
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,816
Speaker 0: He's got to, you know, maintain this thing all the time.

165
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,114
Speaker 0: Um, and so he's doing that and he gets into, he's got this girlfriend also.

166
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:45,796
Speaker 0: Right.

167
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:50,670
Speaker 1: And he gets into post college drama about their relationship.

168
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:51,731
Speaker 0: Yeah.

169
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:55,283
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, he's, he's a young individual, right.

170
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:58,655
Speaker 0: He's got, uh, he wants to get his, his business on.

171
00:11:58,855 --> 00:11:59,176
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,541
Speaker 0: He fell in love with this girl.

173
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:00,601
Speaker 0: Um,

174
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:04,193
Speaker 1: it was mutual, at least for like, they were doing,

175
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:17,955
Speaker 0: it seems like a mutual situation, but she's like, look, you know, this is a mutual situation, but, uh, you know, I got to choose, you know, he's basically in a situation where he's in the lower part of society.

176
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:18,236
Speaker 0: Right.

177
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:21,425
Speaker 0: He's a lower, you know, economic, uh, rung.

178
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,873
Speaker 0: So he doesn't have much to lose.

179
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:24,235
Speaker 0: Right.

180
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,785
Speaker 0: So he's like all in on the love action.

181
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:26,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

182
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:27,810
Speaker 1: Just run away with me.

183
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,225
Speaker 1: And she's like, uh, my family's rich and my dad arranged a marriage.

184
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:32,390
Speaker 1: And are you serious?

185
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,271
Speaker 1: Really?

186
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:33,673
Speaker 1: Right.

187
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:42,865
Speaker 0: She's like, she's like, you know, while I do, she's like, she likes him, but it's like, Hey, uh, I can't choose this over what I've got right now.

188
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:46,254
Speaker 1: Like any, and this is after about this book, like

189
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:46,836
Speaker 0: any

190
00:12:47,858 --> 00:13:06,699
Speaker 1: like male gendered crypto online nerd, who's like the kind of character relief is his first solution is not to have a conversation or to do any normal adult reasonable thing, but to write an AI bot to hide her from him on the internet forever, because he's being a little baby about it.

191
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:07,443
Speaker 0: Yeah.

192
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,552
Speaker 0: He's she's like, listen, all right, this is it.

193
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,099
Speaker 0: Don't contact me again.

194
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,661
Speaker 0: Right.

195
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:12,445
Speaker 1: Don't contact me.

196
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:13,630
Speaker 1: Well, I will contact you.

197
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,445
Speaker 1: I'm going to literally write a bot to erase you from the internet.

198
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:17,229
Speaker 0: Right.

199
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,240
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't erase her from the internet.

200
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,750
Speaker 1: It's almost like an ad blocker that blocks him from ever seeing her again and prevents her from ever communicating with him again.

201
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,351
Speaker 0: Right.

202
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,940
Speaker 0: And it's not a simple one either.

203
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,724
Speaker 0: It's like that sort of.

204
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:34,816
Speaker 0: the plot is that he doesn't just block, like, you know, he doesn't do the simple thing of like, okay, this is her email address.

205
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,484
Speaker 0: I'm going to block that email address.

206
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:37,769
Speaker 0: This is her IP address.

207
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:38,672
Speaker 0: I'm going to block that.

208
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:44,733
Speaker 0: He makes like an intelligent, almost like a machine learning thing, like the chat GPT.

209
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:45,093
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:49,766
Speaker 0: That can read that looks at the text of incoming content.

211
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:50,427
Speaker 0: Right.

212
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:55,724
Speaker 0: To his computer systems and tries to determine who wrote that content.

213
00:13:55,745 --> 00:14:05,360
Speaker 0: So if she were to like get a new email address or a new text number or any kind of other communication service, let's say a new, a new communication service appears, right?

214
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:06,966
Speaker 0: A new, a new social network.

215
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,016
Speaker 0: And she makes an account and types messages.

216
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:12,004
Speaker 0: The AI can sort of detect that.

217
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:13,108
Speaker 0: that's her writing style.

218
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:22,841
Speaker 0: She wrote that and pre block so that there's absolutely no way that she will ever be able to digitally communicate with him and his computer systems.

219
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:23,685
Speaker 0: Period.

220
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:24,347
Speaker 0: End of story.

221
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:29,484
Speaker 1: I want to head off some nerds because right away, this is not one of the implausible things.

222
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:31,169
Speaker 1: It's not completely.

223
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:33,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, this is real technology.

224
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:34,439
Speaker 1: It is doable.

225
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,492
Speaker 1: I've seen proofs of concept and demos of this kind of tech.

226
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:42,525
Speaker 1: A machine learning algorithms can indeed do this kind of thing.

227
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:50,097
Speaker 0: It's, it, it, it's not going to be, it's, I mean, in the book they portray it as being like a hundred percent, almost a hundred percent perfect, right?

228
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:55,101
Speaker 0: In the real world, it would be like some much lower percent perfect, but it would still be very impressive.

229
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:59,700
Speaker 1: It also wouldn't really work on like very small communications, right?

230
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,505
Speaker 0: But if we took, for example, every geek nights episode, it would, we could make something that separates the rim from the Scott.

231
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:26,400
Speaker 0: We could take all of rims, public postings and whatever other content rim has ever made, you know, and put it on, you know, that we could access and throw it all in there and make a thing that is very, a computer program that is very, very good at identifying whether something new, a new piece of text or a new audio is rim or not rim.

232
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:39,445
Speaker 1: It's basically like at work recently, I, you know, write evals and like review other people and write things that the person who's the recipient of it is going to get a summary, but they don't actually let them see the actual text.

233
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:45,426
Speaker 1: And I got a note back from HR that literally said like, yeah, we are really rewrote yours.

234
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,553
Speaker 1: Uh, you have a distinctive writing style.

235
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:51,708
Speaker 0: Uh, but I mean, you could do it for even people without it, right?

236
00:15:51,748 --> 00:16:00,563
Speaker 0: Cause you're, I'm easy to detect on the internet, the kind of machine learning technology we have now that looks at a picture and is like, are there cats or no cats?

237
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:01,467
Speaker 0: Where are the cats?

238
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,170
Speaker 0: There's the cat.

239
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,832
Speaker 0: That's a tree.

240
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:10,136
Speaker 1: Now this is just shitty, but it's not over an ethical line yet, but then how does he train this machine learning model?

241
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:22,635
Speaker 1: He uses the same network that he built to protect all these dissidents and basically runs a botnet and non-consensual key loggers to gather the data necessary to train the model.

242
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:34,130
Speaker 1: And that of course, that's why the title is funny because Alif the Unseen is seen by the government and the main antagonist basically instantly in this book.

243
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,605
Speaker 1: Like he writes this thing and like the next day shit has hit the fan.

244
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,552
Speaker 1: And I appreciated that it moved fast.

245
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,522
Speaker 0: So the plot is that this AI becomes like too good.

246
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:47,052
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not just blocking this girl.

247
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:48,960
Speaker 0: It's like, it's, it's going out of control.

248
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,784
Speaker 0: Right.

249
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:55,246
Speaker 1: And then the government, all his, all his contacts like, yo, what the fuck did you put on the botnet?

250
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,069
Speaker 1: It's using my CPU.

251
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:58,523
Speaker 1: And then the government's like, whoa, look at that.

252
00:16:58,564 --> 00:16:59,871
Speaker 1: We've been trying to write something like that.

253
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:00,996
Speaker 1: Let's figure out who wrote that.

254
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:02,843
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

255
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:03,747
Speaker 0: So he's like, Oh shit.

256
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:04,088
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

257
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:04,470
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

258
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,079
Speaker 0: And he's, he's, so now he's on the run, right?

259
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,609
Speaker 0: Because what's, what's the name of the bad guy?

260
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:12,097
Speaker 1: Oh, well the hand, the hand.

261
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:16,633
Speaker 0: so that the hand is basically sort of this mysterious government individual.

262
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:21,817
Speaker 0: And you imagine that they're basically like, they're not the, the, the King or the Sultan or whatever the person.

263
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,807
Speaker 0: they're like the Jafar, they're the year.

264
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:28,987
Speaker 0: They're the, they're basically like, yeah, they're like this, the evil CTO of the government.

265
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:32,757
Speaker 0: Who's running the, the internet systems?

266
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:42,118
Speaker 1: because, yeah, but, uh, the IT department in wool, like the guy who ran that Bernard, I think was his name anyway.

267
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,646
Speaker 0: But yeah, so the hand, anyway, I don't know.

268
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,904
Speaker 0: I don't, but yeah, the hand is basically upon him, right?

269
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:54,520
Speaker 0: So he's like, Oh shit, I got to run and save my ass and also protect my clients.

270
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,353
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, he shuts the thing down to protect the clients.

271
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:58,559
Speaker 0: He goes to his friend.

272
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,941
Speaker 1: He also cauterizes the wound and a whole bunch of them just get compromised straight up and they're just fucked.

273
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:05,834
Speaker 1: And there's, and to his credit, there's nothing like.

274
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:10,330
Speaker 1: he's really broken up about having to basically leave a whole bunch of people.

275
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,859
Speaker 1: He's helped to die, uh, literally die in many cases, but at the same time, there is literally nothing he could do.

276
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,320
Speaker 0: Cause I think a big theme is he could have not been a baby in the first place, but he could have too late.

277
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,667
Speaker 1: He could have not written tin.

278
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:23,109
Speaker 1: Sorry.

279
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,676
Speaker 1: And deployed it in the first place.

280
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:25,500
Speaker 1: That was his fucking.

281
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,770
Speaker 0: sorry is the name of the computer program.

282
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:44,225
Speaker 1: But at the same time of a really big theme in this book that I think is understated, but very important to it is the idea that people who are very online one, they will see very online solutions as the default solutions to problems.

283
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:52,570
Speaker 1: Like that's the hammer they use for any nail they see, even if it's a screw or a person, but also how internet power is real.

284
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,255
Speaker 1: Like the book doesn't say the internet doesn't do anything.

285
00:18:55,335 --> 00:19:03,591
Speaker 1: That's, that is like the opposite of the limits.

286
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:09,110
Speaker 1: And a guy with a crowbar has a lot of power that an internet person cannot wield.

287
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:10,854
Speaker 0: Yep.

288
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:16,317
Speaker 0: So once this happens, the game, the, the book sort of breaks out of the, the internet part, right?

289
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:23,349
Speaker 0: And now you have this real world situation where it's like, there's government agents coming to get him and he's just some kid.

290
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:28,493
Speaker 1: But what's fat, what I really like is he is at this point, he is portrayed despite his fuck up with tin.

291
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:28,895
Speaker 1: Sorry.

292
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,226
Speaker 1: He is a super skilled computer person.

293
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:32,110
Speaker 1: Like he's a good hacker.

294
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:33,334
Speaker 1: He's very good.

295
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:36,544
Speaker 1: He's got extreme OPSEC in his actual internet life.

296
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:48,470
Speaker 1: But as soon as he is walking around, looking around kid, doesn't know shit like uses a cell phone, like all the, he does all these fuck ups along the way and basically like makes it so easy for the police to find him.

297
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:53,490
Speaker 1: It's kind of funny, like how unworldly and naive he is once he's not online.

298
00:19:54,651 --> 00:20:02,197
Speaker 0: So he gets, he's basically now just literally on the run, like running and hiding from, you know, people on the street trying to find him.

299
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:02,739
Speaker 0: Right.

300
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:11,217
Speaker 0: And he wrote, he gets assistance from local computer guy, which is, you know, clearly we're going to be one of those like awesome side characters.

301
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,428
Speaker 0: I imagine him a lot like, um, ghost in the shell.

302
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:15,793
Speaker 0: What's the, that's the guy's name.

303
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:20,567
Speaker 0: Uh, not narrow guy beard guy goes in the show.

304
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:22,174
Speaker 0: Who sits in the computer room all the time.

305
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:22,817
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

306
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:23,119
Speaker 1: I forget.

307
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:23,984
Speaker 1: I forget all their names.

308
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,693
Speaker 1: I haven't watched ghost in the shell in like a decade.

309
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:31,744
Speaker 1: Anyway, the one who's also addicted to pachinko, right?

310
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:32,766
Speaker 0: Yes.

311
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:33,067
Speaker 1: Yeah.

312
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:34,891
Speaker 0: I remember that.

313
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:35,835
Speaker 0: Yeah.

314
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:37,902
Speaker 0: Uh, and also his neighbor, right?

315
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,688
Speaker 0: So his neighbor is the big deal, right?

316
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:50,945
Speaker 1: So his neighbor is like just this, you know, observant, you know, Muslim girls specifically, she converted against the wishes of her family to an extreme Wahhabist form of Islam.

317
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:51,707
Speaker 0: Yep.

318
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:52,973
Speaker 0: She wasn't that observant.

319
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:53,938
Speaker 0: And then she's like, no, what?

320
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,588
Speaker 0: I actually believe in this whole bunch.

321
00:20:55,709 --> 00:21:01,092
Speaker 0: I'm going to observe more, you know, which is something I've seen in my life with a lot of Jews where they grew up in a house.

322
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:05,326
Speaker 0: And the house was this level of observant of Judaism.

323
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:10,709
Speaker 0: And some of the children in the house became less observant and some children in the house became more observant.

324
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,210
Speaker 0: Right.

325
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:11,612
Speaker 0: It's a thing.

326
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:12,636
Speaker 0: It's a thing that happens.

327
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,431
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's, that's what happens to this neighbor.

328
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:27,852
Speaker 1: Obviously, like reading this book for the first time within two sentences of Dina being introduced, it is a hundred percent clear she's been the eponine to this other relationship the whole time.

329
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,403
Speaker 1: Like it is so obvious that she always had a thing.

330
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:37,792
Speaker 0: We've seen a lot of animes where, you know, the neighbor, the neighbor best friend your whole life wins out in the, in the dating sim.

331
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:38,014
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:39,663
Speaker 1: It's critically like, why are you reading?

333
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:41,392
Speaker 1: Why do you want to read all my fantasy books?

334
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,950
Speaker 1: Like, it's not like you can, like, you're still mad about it because of Islam or whatever.

335
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:50,210
Speaker 1: And he like does not get it that she just wants to hang out with him at any point.

336
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,969
Speaker 1: No, he doesn't figure it out until near the end of the book.

337
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,090
Speaker 0: That's, you know, he figures it out though to the credit of the author.

338
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,230
Speaker 1: I would say he kind of figures it out because multiple genies tell him like kind of directly.

339
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,396
Speaker 0: It is sort of a cliche though, right?

340
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:10,113
Speaker 0: Like, you know, the, the, the, the quote hot girl, right?

341
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,602
Speaker 0: And then the neighbor girl is the real one.

342
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:13,004
Speaker 0: Right.

343
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,792
Speaker 0: I mean, look at a fucking macross, right?

344
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:20,235
Speaker 0: You got, it's like the, the min may, but no, it was actually the Mesa the whole time.

345
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:20,778
Speaker 1: Right.

346
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,006
Speaker 0: You've seen that play out a whole bunch.

347
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,376
Speaker 1: So anyway, but I like how he's playing.

348
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:30,740
Speaker 1: Eventually they, one of his computer friends is like, Oh, I know a guy who got beaten up real badly.

349
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,891
Speaker 1: You should go find out who beat him up and hire that guy.

350
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:36,755
Speaker 1: So anyway, he's like, yeah, that's a great idea.

351
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:37,576
Speaker 1: Let's go.

352
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:38,679
Speaker 0: He's on the run.

353
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:45,786
Speaker 0: And because he's desperate, he seeks help from Vikram, the vampire, who you imagine is just like some super dangerous underworld guy.

354
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:48,717
Speaker 1: My favorite character in the book instantly.

355
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:53,794
Speaker 1: The fact that their first meeting is Vikram basically just like punches him out.

356
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:57,287
Speaker 1: And then when he wakes up, all Vikram says like, Whoa, man.

357
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:57,568
Speaker 1: Yeah.

358
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:58,010
Speaker 1: Sorry.

359
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,620
Speaker 1: I, uh, didn't think you'd be that fragile buddy.

360
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,667
Speaker 1: Like the fuck are you even doing talking to me?

361
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:03,748
Speaker 1: Yep.

362
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:06,355
Speaker 0: It's like why?

363
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:11,190
Speaker 0: But anyway, Vikram is, literally, uh, a magical genie type being.

364
00:23:11,552 --> 00:23:11,832
Speaker 1: Yep.

365
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:14,742
Speaker 0: Uh, and now this is where you get into sort of the magical, right?

366
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:19,742
Speaker 0: But up until this point, the whole book was like, you know, cyber punk only, right?

367
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:20,926
Speaker 0: It's mostly realism.

368
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:24,499
Speaker 0: And then suddenly it's like the magic part starts to creep in.

369
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,343
Speaker 1: We've got a leaf living in a world that is unseen to most people, the internet, like he lives in the internet effectively.

370
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:39,960
Speaker 1: So he's living in this unseen world and then he is driven out of this unseen world into the real world where there's men with crowbars because he's in trouble.

371
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,690
Speaker 1: Uh, the scene world, which he doesn't understand that.

372
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:46,085
Speaker 1: Well, it's only a big parts of it are unseen to him effectively.

373
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,269
Speaker 1: Like he doesn't really think about it.

374
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:51,264
Speaker 1: And then he ends up in yet another unseen world.

375
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:55,601
Speaker 1: The world of the gin is definitely a parallel to the world of the internet in this book.

376
00:23:55,661 --> 00:24:00,096
Speaker 1: Like that allegory is strong and pervasive and I think it's well executed.

377
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:00,919
Speaker 1: Yeah.

378
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,009
Speaker 0: It's like, how did the gin exist in this world?

379
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:03,793
Speaker 0: That's so modern.

380
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,782
Speaker 0: Well, it's like, well, there's a whole bunch of them.

381
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:14,038
Speaker 0: They're mostly, you know, on the edge of town, people who don't believe in them, look at them and just see normal people or see nothing or don't, you know, right.

382
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,213
Speaker 1: One of them is like, Oh yeah, a whole bunch of us are in Detroit.

383
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:17,722
Speaker 1: Like that's a pretty happening place for gin.

384
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:18,566
Speaker 1: Yeah.

385
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:22,543
Speaker 0: And it's like, but to actually get to like, you know, there's, there's places the gin live.

386
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:27,061
Speaker 0: Like there's a market and there's a city where they're at and you can't like get there.

387
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:31,718
Speaker 0: unless like, you know, you can see and understand and go the right way.

388
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:36,112
Speaker 0: That's like, you know, perpendicular to the modern world.

389
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:43,798
Speaker 1: Someone who's very online, like say me or Scott, there are parts of the internet and like places online that we just know how to get to.

390
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,406
Speaker 1: that a lot of people don't even know exist.

391
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,059
Speaker 1: And even if you told them they exist, good luck finding them.

392
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:57,973
Speaker 1: Explain to grandma, like great grandma, what a discord is, let alone get her to the point where she logs into one and a discourse, not even that hit, right.

393
00:24:57,993 --> 00:24:59,238
Speaker 0: There's an IRCs and stuff.

394
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:08,424
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, so Vikram explaining shit to the humans, uh, is very similar to Scott explaining shit to the non online people.

395
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:08,805
Speaker 1: we know.

396
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:09,728
Speaker 0: Yep.

397
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:14,544
Speaker 0: But yeah, he's, you know, he's basically because he's got no other choice, right.

398
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:30,467
Speaker 1: And because they're willing to help him, uh, so generously, um, you get the impression Vikram and his sister are not necessarily good people, but they're not necessarily cruel people.

399
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,876
Speaker 1: They're just, they've lived so long.

400
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:36,208
Speaker 1: They've been on every side of everything and kind of done whatever for a long time.

401
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:41,167
Speaker 1: Like they are just inhuman, dangerous, but also interesting and kind of cool.

402
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:46,468
Speaker 1: Like I love how he hangs out with the convert and he's just always weird around her all the time.

403
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:47,672
Speaker 0: All right.

404
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:51,107
Speaker 0: So now why, why are these gin helping this, this guy, right?

405
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:53,038
Speaker 0: This, you know, they don't have to help them for any reason.

406
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:54,064
Speaker 0: They don't first.

407
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:55,693
Speaker 1: They're just like, kid, get the fuck out of here.

408
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:56,800
Speaker 1: You're in way over your head.

409
00:25:57,262 --> 00:26:00,414
Speaker 1: But then they're like, oh wait, what, what's that book you got there?

410
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:08,364
Speaker 0: That's exactly the, the reason they help them is because of the, the McGuffin of the stit, the tail, the Alfio.

411
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:08,685
Speaker 0: Right.

412
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:13,604
Speaker 0: So basically, you know, humans have the book thousand and one night or, you know, nights, right.

413
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:14,206
Speaker 0: Famous book.

414
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,392
Speaker 0: I'm sure you know all about it.

415
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,758
Speaker 0: I hope you do anyway.

416
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,564
Speaker 1: Hey, what if that's the booklet book I'm taking?

417
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:20,549
Speaker 0: That's all right.

418
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,887
Speaker 0: But anyway, so, but you know, the Alfio is, I don't know if that's a thing.

419
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:30,429
Speaker 0: Does that a thing that exists or is just a tail or was it made up for this book specifically?

420
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,952
Speaker 0: I don't know.

421
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:31,877
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

422
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:35,854
Speaker 1: I'm going to look it up, but that brings to a side point that I just want to mention so we don't forget it.

423
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:48,803
Speaker 1: What I enjoyed about one thing I enjoyed about this book specifically was that a lot of the literature I read being a person living in America who's white, either like it comes from cultural traditions that I'm familiar with.

424
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:56,042
Speaker 1: And this is a Greek mythologies, Greek mythology, like European history, like that kind of.

425
00:26:56,484 --> 00:27:00,940
Speaker 1: And the fact that people shit is a cyberpunk, magical realism, all of the stuff.

426
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:09,814
Speaker 1: But instead of like a reference to something that's described as an angel, it's all based in Middle Eastern related mythology and history and culture and religion.

427
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:22,119
Speaker 1: And it was refreshing just to see a book like this, like that, and from that perspective and having all the sort of references and ideas come from a very different frame from what I typically read.

428
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,996
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you Google Alfio, it only comes up in relation to this book.

429
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:29,020
Speaker 1: It's not a thing.

430
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:44,124
Speaker 0: So at the very beginning of this book, so like the preamble, it is a scene of like this old scribe of some kind who has like, you know, captured some sort of jinn demon and forced him to talk, forced it to talk.

431
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,716
Speaker 1: And I love that jinn is like, you really want this story?

432
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:47,600
Speaker 1: Good fucking luck.

433
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,222
Speaker 1: I'll tell you.

434
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,169
Speaker 1: But it's going to be bad news, buddy.

435
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:50,952
Speaker 0: Right.

436
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:55,646
Speaker 0: And tell him the the jinn's tales and he transcribes them into a book.

437
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:57,030
Speaker 0: And that book is the Alfio.

438
00:27:57,913 --> 00:28:05,499
Speaker 0: And Alif gets his hands on this book because the wealthy girlfriend, who is never going to see again, sends it to him.

439
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:07,042
Speaker 1: Yep.

440
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,914
Speaker 1: And she trusted him and she was like, yeah, you're better off.

441
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:14,832
Speaker 1: Hey, whatever's going on with this book, you are the only person who's going to be able to get it out of here.

442
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:15,876
Speaker 0: Yep.

443
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:18,827
Speaker 0: So he's got this book and the book is super.

444
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,575
Speaker 0: Why is the book super special?

445
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:22,442
Speaker 0: It's just a bunch of stories, right?

446
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:41,954
Speaker 1: Well, because this basically the book, I think, does not the greatest job of explaining this because they clearly a magical tome where literally, depending on who you are and what your frame of mind is, when you read it, like the text will be different potentially.

447
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:44,642
Speaker 1: And it is just allegory.

448
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:59,281
Speaker 1: And the implication I get, I read it as up to a point, the smarter or more worldly or more able to read or see the unseen you are, the deeper the allegory goes, like you'll get more out of the book.

449
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:08,567
Speaker 1: But at the same time, your own personal biases and your view of the world will almost poison what the book tells you.

450
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:15,892
Speaker 1: Like the book will tell you things from your own perspective, which leads me back to Tin Sari was a machine learning algorithm.

451
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:24,271
Speaker 1: I read the Altheom as being a jinn machine learning algorithm that will basically read the world and the human.

452
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:30,505
Speaker 1: And biases you bring it.

453
00:29:30,545 --> 00:29:34,780
Speaker 1: the same way machine learning algorithms bring you the biases you handed them.

454
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,553
Speaker 0: I mean, even normal books present the biases you bring them.

455
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:46,753
Speaker 0: But so the idea, the reason the book is valuable that a leaf doesn't realize, but the hand does.

456
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:59,555
Speaker 0: And then a leaf eventually realizes is that the they're thinking that if you could understand this book, it could inspire you to understand a new way to program a computer, right?

457
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:00,638
Speaker 0: Metaphorically, right?

458
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:08,668
Speaker 0: If you could write a computer program, you know, the way that this book was written, then you could write a very powerful magical computer program.

459
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:22,091
Speaker 1: It's even hinted that it is a mystical form of machine learning or algorithmic like code in that you get the parable of the, you know, the acronym God, God over jinn and how that expands infinitely.

460
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,496
Speaker 1: And there's there's a lot of.

461
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:28,320
Speaker 1: some of the metaphors are a little clumsy, but they're all there and they all point to that same direction.

462
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:29,541
Speaker 0: Yep.

463
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:34,065
Speaker 0: So in the interest of, you know, that's what get basically gets Vikram and everyone to help him out.

464
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:35,052
Speaker 0: is this book, right?

465
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:37,724
Speaker 0: It's like they need to, you know, understand what the book is.

466
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,972
Speaker 0: So they visit this translator woman.

467
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:43,706
Speaker 1: I love how later you find out, I don't even see her again.

468
00:30:43,746 --> 00:30:48,327
Speaker 1: You just find out every, even the jinn are all like, oh yeah, she's way too powerful to fuck with.

469
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:51,236
Speaker 0: Oh, the translator.

470
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:57,320
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, she comes up with later, like she's like, if they mention her and what, like what type of jinn she is toward the end.

471
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,668
Speaker 0: No, she's not a, she's not a jinn.

472
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:00,853
Speaker 0: She's just a person.

473
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:02,742
Speaker 1: Oh no, you're, you're talking about the convert.

474
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:03,866
Speaker 0: Yeah.

475
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:04,188
Speaker 0: The con.

476
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:11,898
Speaker 1: Oh, I was talking about the person who did some translation, who owns the shop that they went to first when they went into the immovable.

477
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,184
Speaker 0: Oh no, no, not that person.

478
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:14,430
Speaker 1: I forget any of their names.

479
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:20,838
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, the convert person, you get the feeling is sort of like a, an author stand in, in some ways, right?

480
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:22,645
Speaker 0: Because the author being a convert as well.

481
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:23,227
Speaker 1: Yeah.

482
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:28,850
Speaker 1: Cause she's definitely early on portrayed as like the white person who is converted, but doesn't fully get it.

483
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,186
Speaker 1: And like is, is too fervent in some ways and not fervent enough in other ways.

484
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:47,797
Speaker 1: And definitely has like very Western and very American and British influences, but also how she comes around and learns and grows as a character to the point that she has Vikram's baby and like becomes a bigger part of the world.

485
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:48,659
Speaker 1: Yeah.

486
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,351
Speaker 0: But the convert is basically like a, you know, a book, you know, archeology type expert person who's at the university and they get help from, from them.

487
00:31:56,371 --> 00:32:04,967
Speaker 1: And then they get help from genies and it's a whole adventure kind of deal where they go to the university and Vikram just around and sneaks in on his own is being cagey.

488
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,634
Speaker 1: The whole time is one of my favorite scenes.

489
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:07,497
Speaker 0: Yep.

490
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:12,828
Speaker 0: So, you know, a whole bunch of adventure biz happens and then, uh, I'll leave gets caught.

491
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:13,710
Speaker 1: Yeah.

492
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:29,480
Speaker 0: I'm you know, I think they get caught because they're at what ends up happening is like the, the, the climb, the climax of the adventure part at least is they're at like the big, uh, temple, right.

493
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:38,312
Speaker 0: Or mosque in the, in the city and the, you know, the guy who runs it, you know, the, the head religious guy is there and he's pretty pragmatic and chill.

494
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,416
Speaker 1: That guy's a fun character.

495
00:32:39,436 --> 00:32:40,339
Speaker 1: Yeah.

496
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:49,231
Speaker 0: He's also, but he's also old and like doesn't understand, you know, the computer biz, but like, you know, he's still, you know, understands like who's a good guy.

497
00:32:49,391 --> 00:33:02,782
Speaker 1: He's very like, look, uh, clearly you are running away from what I assume are the police, but, uh, I'm just going to use the fact that you dirty the carpet in the mosque as an excuse to hide you here long enough to maybe help you out.

498
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:05,231
Speaker 1: Uh, or in the very least give you a respite.

499
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:11,616
Speaker 1: Like he's, you get the sense he has lived through multiple revolutions and societal upheavals over his long life.

500
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:12,539
Speaker 0: Yeah.

501
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,025
Speaker 0: I mean, see the same thing happen.

502
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:23,566
Speaker 0: You know, I think happens a lot in, um, in older like gangster movies where like they go to the Catholic church, the Catholic priest and the Catholic priest will, you know, protect you.

503
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:25,495
Speaker 0: Cause it's like these is confessing.

504
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:25,777
Speaker 0: Right.

505
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:30,779
Speaker 0: But then, you know, the Catholic priest might tell someone to turn themselves in, but they won't turn someone in.

506
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:39,120
Speaker 1: So just like that scene where you've got the criminal in the church and the cops are like outside waiting for them to come out, you get the exact same situation here with the mosque.

507
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:40,002
Speaker 0: Right.

508
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:43,678
Speaker 0: But yeah, when he's in the church, a leaf sort of, you know, figures that out.

509
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:44,441
Speaker 0: He figures it out.

510
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:47,172
Speaker 0: He's got an old, the pre-sold shitty laptop or whatever.

511
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:47,734
Speaker 0: Right.

512
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:49,541
Speaker 0: He's, he's got the book.

513
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:51,928
Speaker 0: He figures it out, but then he gets caught.

514
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:56,442
Speaker 0: Uh, and then he's got the prison action and the book.

515
00:33:56,823 --> 00:34:08,726
Speaker 0: See, this is what the things I didn't like about the book, at least, you know, I guess it was positive in some ways and negative in some ways is that the, the amount of time spent on different things happening.

516
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:14,429
Speaker 0: It's like, sometimes the book felt like it was in fast forward and sometimes it felt like it was in slow motion.

517
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,936
Speaker 0: Now that it's a good thing.

518
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:18,967
Speaker 0: You're supposed to, you know, be changing the, the speed.

519
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:21,755
Speaker 1: You don't want to, I like to ma, but it is.

520
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:27,574
Speaker 1: every Duma book goes at the exact same pace of new information at events, no matter what.

521
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:29,601
Speaker 1: And I've never encountered an exception.

522
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:30,445
Speaker 0: Yeah.

523
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,790
Speaker 0: You know, that's not good, right?

524
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:43,107
Speaker 0: That's boring and tedious, but you also don't want is like, you know, this, these sort of wild swings that are, are sometimes appropriate and sometimes not appropriate.

525
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:48,346
Speaker 0: And I think the biggest wild swing was when he was in prison, the book slows down to like a crawl.

526
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:55,806
Speaker 1: Now I think I see now that's good because I feel like that, that was a good move there.

527
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:56,047
Speaker 0: Right.

528
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:58,216
Speaker 0: It's like to make you feel right.

529
00:34:58,236 --> 00:35:02,253
Speaker 0: That like, you know, the part before it was, it was, should have been faster.

530
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:02,474
Speaker 0: Right.

531
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,507
Speaker 0: It was like a more adventure-y running away kind of situation.

532
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:06,832
Speaker 0: Move things along.

533
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:07,817
Speaker 0: You're in prison.

534
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:15,389
Speaker 0: You got to make, it wasn't in prison actually that long, but you had to make it actually was, but you had to make it feel like it's long to the reader.

535
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:15,971
Speaker 0: Right.

536
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:17,216
Speaker 1: But I think what she did a

537
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:17,938
Speaker 0: very good job

538
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:35,567
Speaker 1: of that disorient the reader a little bit, just like a leaf is disoriented in the solitary confinement torture chamber, basically trying to get you to like, not be sure yourself and sort of have a like the, when he escapes, it's almost like the light coming back on and you as the reader are just as disoriented as he is.

539
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,901
Speaker 1: And that just wasn't, it could have been executed a little better.

540
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:49,241
Speaker 1: I agree because right after they get out of prison, it accelerates so fast and like half the things that happened, I would really have liked to have read a couple more sentences about that.

541
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:50,164
Speaker 0: Right.

542
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:59,522
Speaker 0: And so it's like when it was a good choice to go slow there, it's like at the different parts of the book, they were making mostly like the right choice of like, this should be fast.

543
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:00,767
Speaker 0: This should be slow.

544
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:01,390
Speaker 0: Right.

545
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,494
Speaker 0: And it's like, yes, correct.

546
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:09,076
Speaker 0: Those are the right choices, but the, the speed they set it to was wrong when they were going fast.

547
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:11,364
Speaker 0: Sometimes it was too fast when they were going slow.

548
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,091
Speaker 0: Sometimes it was too slow.

549
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:13,754
Speaker 0: All right.

550
00:36:14,095 --> 00:36:14,838
Speaker 0: So it's like, yup.

551
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:16,564
Speaker 0: The prison being slow was good.

552
00:36:16,945 --> 00:36:20,977
Speaker 0: The, the D actiony parts being fast was good, but too fast.

553
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,583
Speaker 0: It's like, chill out.

554
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:23,226
Speaker 0: Right.

555
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:26,902
Speaker 0: We need, we need a few, especially the end of the book was, was way too fast.

556
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:27,343
Speaker 0: Right.

557
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,571
Speaker 0: It's like the clot near the very end.

558
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:35,474
Speaker 0: Couldn't, I felt like it could, it could, didn't hit hard enough because it was going, it was breezing right past.

559
00:36:35,554 --> 00:36:46,377
Speaker 1: It was going so fast that where in previous scenes I could picture in my head what was happening when the riot happens from that point on, I could not really piece together specifics of what happened.

560
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:50,559
Speaker 0: And I was, it was all, it might as well have written like, Oh, by the way, there's a riot going on.

561
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,347
Speaker 0: Like the whole city's in a riot.

562
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:52,891
Speaker 0: One sentence.

563
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:54,180
Speaker 1: You know what it, you know what it felt like?

564
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,225
Speaker 1: It felt like trying to read the Trigon manga.

565
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:57,228
Speaker 0: Yeah.

566
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:57,709
Speaker 0: You could

567
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:58,652
Speaker 1: have just been as simple as like

568
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:12,316
Speaker 0: one or two paragraphs to be like, you know, really paint the picture of what the, you know, the city in riot, you know, looking like, you know, they did it a little bit, but

569
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:14,664
Speaker 1: you know, what's interesting is because the book was

570
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:14,964
Speaker 0: more,

571
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:22,105
Speaker 1: so the novel was published just as the Arab spring failed, like it was finally done.

572
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:22,868
Speaker 1: It had been crushed.

573
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,224
Speaker 1: So at the very beginning, Alif is, you know, working for all dissidents.

574
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,439
Speaker 1: And at the end when the riot happens and like, no, it's right.

575
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,145
Speaker 1: It's not a hundred percent good.

576
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:38,961
Speaker 1: There's, it's not a, it's not a simple situation taking down the shot.

577
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:42,233
Speaker 1: Doesn't necessarily mean you have a progressive democracy the next day.

578
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:50,959
Speaker 1: And on one hand, you sort of see Alif being confronted with the fact that, Hey, you got what you wanted.

579
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,050
Speaker 1: All of this, this is exactly what you built.

580
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,065
Speaker 1: This is exactly what everything you have been doing online was leading to.

581
00:37:58,487 --> 00:37:59,471
Speaker 1: We're not saying it's good.

582
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,219
Speaker 1: We're not saying it's bad, but that's it.

583
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:02,662
Speaker 1: You did it.

584
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:03,645
Speaker 1: Yep.

585
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:05,030
Speaker 1: Is this really what you wanted?

586
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:09,747
Speaker 1: But two at that point when, uh, they almost, uh, kill new quarter.

587
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:31,802
Speaker 1: And I think it was kind of a cop out that they didn't kill new quarter because one thing that has happened consistently in this region, when there are revolutions like this, which happens in other parts of the world too, in other cultures, uh, the extremists will often ally with progressive students, all the other people who all agree the current regime is corrupt.

588
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:40,310
Speaker 1: But once the current regime is down, the extremist groups tend to immediately turn on their allies and consolidate power and make a worse regime.

589
00:38:41,012 --> 00:38:53,556
Speaker 1: And you see that happening in the book a little bit when, you know, there are Islamists in the room along with the other revolutionaries and they're immediately executing people like as fast as possible.

590
00:38:54,278 --> 00:39:01,901
Speaker 1: But I feel like it was a cop out to let new quarter one survive that because that really blunted the blow to Alif of.

591
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:03,206
Speaker 1: this isn't clean buddy.

592
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:06,559
Speaker 1: Like you have to accept the collateral damage of a revolution like this.

593
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:11,871
Speaker 1: And also at some point you have to have principles.

594
00:39:12,432 --> 00:39:17,069
Speaker 1: You can't, you can't make waste and ignore the fact that Nazis are using it.

595
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:27,066
Speaker 1: You may not be able to prevent all Nazis from using it, but if you build null soft waste, you should at least think about how would you deal with the Nazis if they start using it too much.

596
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:28,310
Speaker 0: Yep.

597
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:29,654
Speaker 1: And Alif did not.

598
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:34,691
Speaker 1: And I feel like new quarter surviving almost the lesson to Alif is yeah, that's all fine.

599
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:35,614
Speaker 1: It'll work itself out.

600
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:36,437
Speaker 0: Yeah.

601
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:44,666
Speaker 0: Oh, but you know, new quarter is basically like, he's not, uh, like, you know, he's like, he's like some minor Prince guy.

602
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:45,288
Speaker 0: Right.

603
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:48,800
Speaker 0: And so he is the one who busts Alif out of prison.

604
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:51,450
Speaker 1: Now, on one hand, I like how it shows that he

605
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,382
Speaker 0: was, he was one of Alif's clients or friends originally,

606
00:39:54,583 --> 00:40:04,599
Speaker 1: but there could be people who are in power and wealthy in a corrupt regime who want to be good people and do want to take the regime down, but don't see any way to do it.

607
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,254
Speaker 1: Like they don't actually have power to do anything substantial, but they want to.

608
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:16,322
Speaker 0: So imagine, imagine yourself in, you know, the French revolution and you are like a, in the court of the King.

609
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:16,944
Speaker 0: Right.

610
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:19,151
Speaker 0: And Marie Antoinette, but you're just a courtier.

611
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:24,353
Speaker 1: And you see that everyone in the government is super corrupt and fucked up and right.

612
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:26,623
Speaker 0: And it's like, she, she comes out, like, let them eat cake.

613
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:27,808
Speaker 0: And you're like, fuck this bitch.

614
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:28,210
Speaker 0: Right.

615
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,264
Speaker 0: It's like, but it's like, you're, what are you going to do?

616
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:32,570
Speaker 0: Go become a peasant?

617
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:36,065
Speaker 0: or it's like, you know, it's like, what can you try to say?

618
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:36,667
Speaker 1: Like, good luck.

619
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:37,289
Speaker 1: Have fun.

620
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:38,252
Speaker 0: Right.

621
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:40,119
Speaker 0: Go hang out at the tennis court with Rose.

622
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:43,838
Speaker 0: It's like, you can't, you know, there's only so much you can do in that position.

623
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,288
Speaker 0: And that's the position that the new quarter person is in.

624
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:49,259
Speaker 1: But I, I, his portrayal was pretty good.

625
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:50,306
Speaker 1: I still think he should have been killed.

626
00:40:50,366 --> 00:41:12,802
Speaker 1: I think that would have made a much stronger statement, but I liked the fact that he is rewarded and thanked for the good he did, but also the book, the characters and the environment do not necessarily just forgive or forget the fact that he also didn't do as much as he could have and was living a life of abject luxury under this regime.

627
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:19,449
Speaker 0: And I mean, you know, he rescues him from prison and they get away and like what the bends or whatever, like some ridiculous car.

628
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:19,830
Speaker 0: Right.

629
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:22,359
Speaker 1: But also he had his own unseen world.

630
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,406
Speaker 1: Like he knew the world of being a rich Prince.

631
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:30,975
Speaker 1: And then as soon as he steps out of that, he pulls the caper and then he's like, oh, fuck, I literally don't know what to do next.

632
00:41:31,015 --> 00:41:31,820
Speaker 1: Where can I even go?

633
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,250
Speaker 1: My cell phone is probably too dangerous to use.

634
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:36,220
Speaker 1: Well, fuck, I guess I'll just die.

635
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,682
Speaker 1: Like being rich also means there is an unseen world to you, the world of what it's actually like for people who don't have money.

636
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:53,198
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I think, you know, the book, you know, there's a lot going on here.

637
00:41:53,318 --> 00:42:00,363
Speaker 0: And I think, you know, in some senses it did a good job of like bringing all those different things together.

638
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:00,784
Speaker 0: Right.

639
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:10,327
Speaker 0: You know, the computer story, the magical genie story, the societal, you know, Arab Spring Revolution story.

640
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:11,169
Speaker 0: Right.

641
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:15,708
Speaker 0: You know, the religious story, all those things combining here is what makes the book unique.

642
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,315
Speaker 0: But it was also a little bit too much.

643
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:17,957
Speaker 1: Right.

644
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:18,339
Speaker 1: Really?

645
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:29,923
Speaker 1: Just like and honestly, if the book had been like 50 more pages long and it just moved at a little slower pace and handled the end a little bit more tightly, I think that would have made it an objectively better book.

646
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:31,269
Speaker 1: So I enjoyed it.

647
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:31,871
Speaker 1: But it was.

648
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:36,449
Speaker 1: it's not like the best book I've ever written as a result of that little bit.

649
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,941
Speaker 1: Like pretty much everything after the prison was fun, but rushed.

650
00:42:40,784 --> 00:42:41,005
Speaker 0: Yep.

651
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:48,370
Speaker 0: I think I'd give it like, you know, the B plus tier, maybe seven out of ten, seven point five out of ten like that area.

652
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:49,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

653
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:52,402
Speaker 0: I'm not I'm not upset to have read this at all.

654
00:42:52,583 --> 00:43:07,360
Speaker 1: And I would like I'm glad I read it, but I'm not going to put it on like greatest hits list because there are some legitimately great moments, some legitimately heartfelt moments and also some laugh out loud moments like when they're in the actual unseen world.

655
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:11,013
Speaker 1: And New Quarter one is like kind of slowly going insane.

656
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:15,166
Speaker 1: And then Ali and the head of the mosque is there, too.

657
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:17,915
Speaker 1: And the gender like, hey, you want to drink this?

658
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:20,484
Speaker 1: It's not alcohol, but it'll still fuck you up.

659
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:23,637
Speaker 1: And New Quarters like, hell yeah, it ain't alcohol.

660
00:43:23,697 --> 00:43:24,219
Speaker 1: It's legal.

661
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:30,320
Speaker 1: And the guy who runs the mosque is like, you don't need to take it that literally.

662
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,551
Speaker 1: It's still a drug that's probably going to fuck you up.

663
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:34,035
Speaker 1: You sure you want to drink that?

664
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,663
Speaker 1: And then a leaf has to pay.

665
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:42,102
Speaker 1: And he's like, he's talking to this ancient entity and he's like, how should I pay you?

666
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:43,287
Speaker 1: And the thing pauses.

667
00:43:43,448 --> 00:43:47,279
Speaker 1: And it's like, so there's malware on my Dell laptop.

668
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:48,303
Speaker 1: Can you deal with that?

669
00:43:48,444 --> 00:43:50,993
Speaker 0: It's like even the jinns have computers.

670
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:51,675
Speaker 0: Right.

671
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:53,743
Speaker 0: And cell phones and all that.

672
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:54,124
Speaker 0: Right.

673
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:56,713
Speaker 0: Even though they're jinns, they still got all that same stuff.

674
00:43:56,793 --> 00:43:57,094
Speaker 0: Yeah.

675
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,301
Speaker 1: And I thought that was a fun moment.

676
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:08,289
Speaker 1: The moment when a leaf is still terrified of Vikram and is talking to Vikram and they don't even say it out loud right away.

677
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:21,803
Speaker 1: But there's the moment where a leaf realizes the cat monster girl that he had sex with was one, not a dream to literally real and was a jinn.

678
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:24,190
Speaker 1: Three is Vikram's sister.

679
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:31,574
Speaker 1: And there's this moment where you see like the gears turning as he figures this out and he gets terrified.

680
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:41,406
Speaker 1: And the fact that Vikram one already knew and two could not care less is really funny, especially at the end when she's still like, yo, that was fun.

681
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:44,215
Speaker 1: If you want to date like I'm down.

682
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,399
Speaker 1: Yeah.

683
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,452
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, kept visiting his room as a cat like, you know, like to men.

684
00:44:49,472 --> 00:44:50,676
Speaker 0: I don't know.

685
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:57,641
Speaker 1: A monster girlfriend who can turn into both a cat and a hawk and fly you around the city and knows a lot of interesting stuff.

686
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:58,725
Speaker 1: You could do worse.

687
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:00,692
Speaker 0: You could do a lot worse.

688
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,261
Speaker 0: But he you know, I guess he's very happy with his neighbor.

689
00:45:04,264 --> 00:45:04,424
Speaker 1: Yep.

690
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:05,669
Speaker 1: Which that was.

691
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:09,604
Speaker 1: that was definitely the intended outcome of, you know, him figuring out.

692
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:11,371
Speaker 1: I did appreciate all the bits around.

693
00:45:12,594 --> 00:45:22,883
Speaker 1: Obviously, converting to a conservative edging into extremist religious organization of any kind is often portrayed as a negative.

694
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:33,396
Speaker 1: And there are negative aspects in this book, but there's a beautiful scene where he basically sees the inside, like what she sees inside of her niqab, because it's not even a hijab.

695
00:45:33,436 --> 00:45:34,620
Speaker 1: She wears the extreme form.

696
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,542
Speaker 1: Yeah.

697
00:45:35,843 --> 00:45:48,201
Speaker 1: And he's inside and he sees the unseen world of Deena, like he sees that she has decorated the inside of it, that like she is the mega nerd on the inside, even though she hides it.

698
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:50,248
Speaker 1: And that's yet another.

699
00:45:50,288 --> 00:45:53,981
Speaker 1: That's like the fourth parallel thread of unseen worlds.

700
00:45:54,463 --> 00:46:05,605
Speaker 1: Do you think, you know, somebody, do you really, you haven't seen the inside of their head, nor have you seen the inside of like their space, like seeing the inside of someone's room could be equally important.

701
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:11,284
Speaker 1: And that revelation to him seeing how she sees the world is a really important note in this book.

702
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:22,803
Speaker 1: You haven't played Disco Elysium, but there's a moment where you get into the hotel room of your partner, which this, your partner in this game is a very private person the whole game.

703
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:29,171
Speaker 1: And you build a big rapport, depending on how you play, but there's a moment and all you do is you get to see the inside of the room.

704
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:32,543
Speaker 1: he's been staying in for the last, for the previous few days or week.

705
00:46:33,285 --> 00:46:43,662
Speaker 1: And it's one of the most intimate moments I've experienced in a video game, but it's as simple as you get inside his apartment or like his room and you see what's on his desk.

706
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:47,015
Speaker 1: Like that's all it is, but it's so profound in the context.

707
00:46:48,440 --> 00:47:02,001
Speaker 0: You keep doing this thing where like, if you know, rim will, rim will like play a game or read a book and then abs like it'll take months for him to not use that one thing as like the reference for absolutely everything else.

708
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:08,805
Speaker 0: You play Disco Elysium and then like every single conversation for like six months, you find a way to make it relevant.

709
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:11,154
Speaker 0: Not that you're wrong, but it's just a thing you do.

710
00:47:11,174 --> 00:47:14,688
Speaker 0: I think it's partly that you got to mix it up, right?

711
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:21,672
Speaker 1: It's like, it has unlike other media, like I couldn't tie this to Breath of the Wild or anything or like Advance Wars.

712
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:24,278
Speaker 1: More than it is.

713
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:36,870
Speaker 1: specifically, without spoiling anything, the direct themes of the seen and the unseen are extremely relevant and specifically one-to-one in some cases.

714
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:41,743
Speaker 0: So I don't know, anything else to say about this book?

715
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,209
Speaker 0: It wasn't actually that long.

716
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:46,082
Speaker 1: Oh, this is, this is like a couple of weekends read tops.

717
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:48,855
Speaker 1: Like once I started reading it, I was done almost instantly.

718
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,081
Speaker 1: It's only a couple hundred pages.

719
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:52,734
Speaker 0: It's a good, it's a good summer beach deal.

720
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:56,993
Speaker 0: So that'll be, you know, maybe if you haven't read it yet and some, why do you listen to all these spoilers?

721
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:57,855
Speaker 0: You wait.

722
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:02,968
Speaker 0: If I were you, I would absolutely read it.

723
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:08,855
Speaker 0: And I mean, I don't believe in spoilers, so I would also say someone who agrees with me might've listened to this episode and not care.

724
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:11,427
Speaker 1: You should probably read, and I'm going to read the Ms.

725
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:14,136
Speaker 1: Marvel book that G. Willow Wilson also wrote.

726
00:48:14,156 --> 00:48:20,094
Speaker 0: And the, the other possible novel that was not selected was what, The Bird King?

727
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:22,220
Speaker 1: Which I, I'm going to read.

728
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:22,642
Speaker 1: I bought it.

729
00:48:22,662 --> 00:48:23,906
Speaker 0: All right.

730
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,130
Speaker 0: I mean, I may read it.

731
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,599
Speaker 1: I can read it immediately, but I'm going to read it.

732
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,631
Speaker 1: It's a good, it might be my beach read this summer.

733
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:29,654
Speaker 0: Yeah.

734
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:38,622
Speaker 0: But yeah, The Bird King by G. Willow Wilson is the, is the book that Rym did not select, which was the second novel by Rym Willow Wilson.

735
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:39,786
Speaker 1: So it's time now.

736
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:42,576
Speaker 1: I get to do the, I cut and Scott chooses.

737
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:51,084
Speaker 1: I have picked two possible books and Scott did the thing where the two books were related and that they were by the same author among other things.

738
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:55,256
Speaker 1: So my two books were both published in the same year.

739
00:48:55,276 --> 00:48:57,803
Speaker 1: Oh, 19 problems.

740
00:48:57,823 --> 00:49:00,009
Speaker 0: So probably not the same author up.

741
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:04,558
Speaker 1: So 1988, both not that old, not that old.

742
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:04,879
Speaker 1: Yep.

743
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:17,887
Speaker 1: Uh, they're both extremely famous books that have broad, widely discussed, uh, lit crit, uh, pull the sociopolitical implications.

744
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,598
Speaker 1: Like these are books that people should have read.

745
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:30,773
Speaker 0: And I consider it a book, a book I may have already read in high school if it's one or, or, or in college, if it's one of those, I'll just pick it and say, I read it already.

746
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:45,820
Speaker 1: So I'll say one more thing, uh, cause there's no way you'd guess, but, uh, by two famous authors, like very famous authors and I have only ever read excerpts from one of them and nothing from the other of them.

747
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,482
Speaker 1: So I feel like there

748
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:59,414
Speaker 0: are many, there are many, uh, books that fall into those kinds of categories for me where there's a famous author or there's something I've only seen an excerpt or, you know, I know it's a super famous book I've heard of and I just haven't read it yet.

749
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:07,740
Speaker 1: And so I'm choosing because whichever one's got picks, it will close what I think is a material gap in my literary education.

750
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:10,349
Speaker 0: So I, that's a good, that's a valid choice.

751
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:24,245
Speaker 0: So either, uh, if you want to get on with our buddy Umberto Eco, I actually, that's one of the, that's exact, that's one of the authors that I know is famous and have never read a book from, uh, Foucault's pendulum, which, okay, I've heard of that.

752
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:25,751
Speaker 1: Do you know what the, what it's actually about?

753
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:26,715
Speaker 0: No idea.

754
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:27,980
Speaker 0: I just know that that's my book.

755
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,856
Speaker 0: So I know that that is the name of a book by Umberto Eco and I haven't read it.

756
00:50:31,936 --> 00:50:34,085
Speaker 1: So here's the, here's the broad deal with it.

757
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:35,189
Speaker 0: It is famous.

758
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,717
Speaker 1: You know that, you know, Dan Brown's the DaVinci code.

759
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:39,844
Speaker 0: Yeah.

760
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:48,689
Speaker 1: Imagine the DaVinci code is like the pop culture bullshit, not actually the same genre version of Foucault's pendulum.

761
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:57,477
Speaker 1: Foucault's pendulum is basically about a bunch of smart academics who think conspiracy theories are stupid and they start studying them for funsies.

762
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:13,445
Speaker 1: And the moral, the broad consensus is that the main themes of the book are that studying those things too seriously is caustic to your psyche and may make you go crazy or introduce you to dangerous people.

763
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:17,658
Speaker 1: And conspiratorial thinking is one of the primary dangers to humanity.

764
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,884
Speaker 0: Isn't that just Call of Cthulhu?

765
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:20,526
Speaker 1: Yeah.

766
00:51:20,907 --> 00:51:21,207
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:25,122
Speaker 1: But for Foucault's pendulum, I think there's a lot more going on.

768
00:51:25,503 --> 00:51:27,551
Speaker 0: And I think I'm sure it's a lot longer too.

769
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:31,703
Speaker 1: Also, I'm pretty sure Umberto Eco is a much better writer than.

770
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:41,394
Speaker 0: You don't say, I just say, but I think that the whole, the story of Call of Cthulhu is you learn too much and you saw things you shouldn't see.

771
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:46,290
Speaker 1: But I get the implication that you don't learn anything.

772
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:46,933
Speaker 1: that's true.

773
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:50,165
Speaker 1: just by hanging out with conspiracy nut jobs, you make yourself stupider.

774
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:51,511
Speaker 0: That's true.

775
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:51,993
Speaker 0: Okay.

776
00:51:52,536 --> 00:51:53,319
Speaker 0: I didn't know anything.

777
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,951
Speaker 0: All I knew is the name and author of that book and that it was famous.

778
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:57,035
Speaker 0: And now I know a lot more.

779
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:57,376
Speaker 0: Okay.

780
00:51:57,456 --> 00:51:58,881
Speaker 1: Second option, which also 1988.

781
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:06,046
Speaker 1: I've never actually read Sam and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, which is a magical realism story.

782
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:08,373
Speaker 0: Same exact category.

783
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,593
Speaker 0: Well, that's the one that all the, you know, the people, you know, that was banned everywhere, right?

784
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,455
Speaker 0: Yeah.

785
00:52:15,736 --> 00:52:23,180
Speaker 1: And in fact, there was a very recent new assassination attempt that almost succeeded on Rushdie again over this book.

786
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,485
Speaker 0: He's alive.

787
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:25,068
Speaker 0: He made it.

788
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:25,470
Speaker 0: Good job.

789
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,700
Speaker 0: He made it with some permanent, he's not doing great.

790
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:31,556
Speaker 1: He's got some permanent disabilities because it was a very violent attack.

791
00:52:31,676 --> 00:52:35,328
Speaker 1: The news really didn't explain exactly what happened right away.

792
00:52:35,348 --> 00:52:37,394
Speaker 1: It was, he's lucky to be alive.

793
00:52:37,756 --> 00:52:39,864
Speaker 1: There have been so many assassination attempts.

794
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:43,977
Speaker 0: Well, those books are basically in the exact same category.

795
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:45,602
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

796
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:47,487
Speaker 0: But the fact that they were famous.

797
00:52:47,588 --> 00:52:48,832
Speaker 0: author, I've heard the book.

798
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:49,675
Speaker 0: I've never read it.

799
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:52,605
Speaker 0: I only know barely what it's about.

800
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:55,395
Speaker 0: I felt like I should have read it, but it didn't.

801
00:52:55,656 --> 00:52:57,665
Speaker 1: I think they're both relevant to 1988.

802
00:52:57,665 --> 00:53:04,208
Speaker 0: You could have told, you could have told me the plot of Satanic Verses when you talked about what goes back to that.

803
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:05,071
Speaker 0: I would have believed you.

804
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:07,417
Speaker 1: So,

805
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:07,698
Speaker 0: uh,

806
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:22,205
Speaker 1: but the fact that they were both written in 1988 by famous authors and I think they were very sociopolitically relevant in 1988 and I think they are equally, if not more relevant, based on what scant knowledge I have about them, having not read them in the year 2023.

807
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:26,299
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm okay reading either or both of those books.

808
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,306
Speaker 0: So, and they're so equivalent.

809
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:29,350
Speaker 0: You wind it up.

810
00:53:30,812 --> 00:53:33,762
Speaker 0: You got two apples that can barely tell them apart.

811
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,972
Speaker 1: And you do the thing of how many computers does Scott own?

812
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:38,740
Speaker 1: And the answers are seven or eight.

813
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:42,354
Speaker 1: Then I'm going to do, here are two books that are functionally equivalent.

814
00:53:42,755 --> 00:53:44,060
Speaker 0: That's exactly what you did.

815
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:58,126
Speaker 0: That is, that is the greatest as a perfect, uh, and now, all right, so I have no choice, but, uh, to allow, I mean, it's, I guess it, you know, defeats the fun of it, but we got to go with the coin toss.

816
00:53:58,186 --> 00:53:58,929
Speaker 1: It's too close.

817
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:01,979
Speaker 1: So we get the coin toss right now, live on the air.

818
00:54:01,999 --> 00:54:02,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

819
00:54:02,642 --> 00:54:03,787
Speaker 0: I got random.org here.

820
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:04,349
Speaker 0: Right.

821
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:11,476
Speaker 0: And I wrote, I got the, what I do is the, and random.org, there's the list randomizer where you put items and it randomizes the order of the list.

822
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:20,966
Speaker 0: And so I just put rush D and echo and I put randomized and whoever is number one on the randomized list will be the book we read.

823
00:54:21,006 --> 00:54:29,803
Speaker 0: And then if I'm, you know, smart, I would read the second book at some point because I'm going to, I will, it'll be a tragedy if I have not read both these books before I die.

824
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:31,068
Speaker 0: I guess so.

825
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,390
Speaker 0: All right.

826
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,815
Speaker 0: So let's see what random.org says.

827
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:35,244
Speaker 0: It says rush D wins.

828
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:36,047
Speaker 0: That's what it says.

829
00:54:36,268 --> 00:54:36,649
Speaker 1: All right.

830
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:37,030
Speaker 1: There you go.

831
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,433
Speaker 1: You'll be reading salmon rush.

832
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:39,635
Speaker 1: The satanic versus.

833
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:48,073
Speaker 1: this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

834
00:54:48,093 --> 00:54:51,711

Speaker 1: You get the same stuff either way.

845
00:55:40,372 --> 00:55:53,279
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, we're, uh, looking at the new website and also looking at some new pipelines to maybe start providing transcripts of the episodes, uh, publishing in more places, maybe streaming live within discords to the stages.

846
00:55:53,379 --> 00:56:05,700
Speaker 1: But, uh, that is all pending Adobe podcast going live because I don't want to make a new pipeline until I have tried out the new Adobe podcast thing because having, uh, had access to a preview.

847
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:09,875
Speaker 1: it is kind of phenomenal and I feel like it's going to save me a lot of hassle.

848
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:17,577
Speaker 1: But for now, at any rate, I leave you simply with... Happy things we should send into space.

849
00:56:18,078 --> 00:56:19,763

00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:28,770
