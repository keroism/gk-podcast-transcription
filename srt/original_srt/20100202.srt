Speaker 1: I can play pretty much any game.

8
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,848
Speaker 1: I would ever wanted to play just perfectly.

9
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:36,230
Speaker 0: really I have a computer that's like a year old or maybe and it can also play any game ever.

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, shittily you get like 20 frames a second in Bioshock.

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:39,963
Speaker 1: I watched you.

12
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:40,806
Speaker 0: Not really.

13
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:44,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, just fine It was unplayable on your PC.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,582
Speaker 1: I tried it.

15
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:45,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're just crazy.

16
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,899
Speaker 1: Anyway, I've got this awesome PC.

17
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:49,462
Speaker 1: It's all set.

18
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,170
Speaker 1: What have I been playing for the last?

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,691
Speaker 1: I don't know.

20
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,998
Speaker 1: three days back man counter-strike.

21
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,522
Speaker 0: It's might as well be pac-man.

22
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:58,030
Speaker 1: Well, it is counter-strike source to be fair.

23
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:00,519
Speaker 0: So it's pac-man.

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:14,583
Speaker 1: miss pac-man The thing is I'm kind of happy that I'm doing really well at counter-strike like more so than I used to in the Source in my experience is much harder than regular counter-strike, but I'm doing the.

25
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,070
Speaker 1: I'm doing better than I used to do in these games.

26
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:22,888
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's the mouse It's the mouse or just the fact that I have a ping like I used to have at our IT.

27
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,015
Speaker 0: again It's the mouse and the ping.

28
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,481
Speaker 1: I think it's the mouse and the ping.

29
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:29,633
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz I went back, you know at our IT It was like what's my ping?

30
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:33,164
Speaker 1: I don't know six maybe seven if it's around 11.

31
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:34,247
Speaker 1: I quit because fuck that.

32
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:40,688
Speaker 0: Yep That's why my skills at FPS is greatly decreased when I left our IT cuz my pain greatly increased.

33
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,248
Speaker 1: also We don't play every single day like we used to yeah multiple hours every single day.

34
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:47,072
Speaker 1: Oh my god I remember.

35
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:48,138
Speaker 1: I'd like come home from our.

36
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:49,022
Speaker 1: I'd like from class.

37
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,410
Speaker 1: You'd be at home playing tribes.

38
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,381
Speaker 1: I just joined the game like an hour later.

39
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,364
Speaker 1: You'd leave and go to class.

40
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:55,408
Speaker 1: I'd stay I'd keep playing.

41
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:56,010
Speaker 1: you'd come home.

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,116
Speaker 1: I just you know keep playing.

43
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:57,899
Speaker 1: then I'd go to class.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,301
Speaker 1: I come back.

45
00:01:58,342 --> 00:01:59,005
Speaker 1: You're still playing.

46
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:04,353
Speaker 1: Yep Stopped every now and then to like eat but I Eat it while playing.

47
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,137
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

48
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:08,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually I'd make that kitsune ramen and then I'd eat it in my lap.

49
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,586
Speaker 0: But I need some ramen.

50
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:09,889
Speaker 0: you got me.

51
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:10,693
Speaker 0: I got a ton.

52
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:14,549
Speaker 1: I gotta take some but I get it all over my keyboard because I beat it.

53
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,920
Speaker 1: But I'd be hungry, you know, I eat it too fast.

54
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,085
Speaker 0: Just this weekend.

55
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,210
Speaker 0: I dishwashed my keyboard.

56
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:22,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't really do that with my DOS keyboard.

57
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:23,105
Speaker 0: It worked real nice.

58
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:23,507
Speaker 0: It's now.

59
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:24,230
Speaker 0: it's like super clean.

60
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,483
Speaker 0: I got to do my one for home.

61
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:26,150
Speaker 0: I did the work one.

62
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:31,025
Speaker 1: I kind of want to take another DOS keyboard to work, but I think my co-workers would kill me.

63
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,630
Speaker 1: Why click click click.

64
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,256
Speaker 0: Just get the happy hacking keyboard.

65
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,239
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about it.

66
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,285
Speaker 0: We'll see if it's good for VIM.

67
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:41,516
Speaker 0: cuz the escape key is so close But there's no numpad.

68
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,400
Speaker 0: so you gotta get a numpad.

69
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get one of those like external numpad.

70
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,450
Speaker 1: I got external numpads or the company that makes my awesome mouse.

71
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,609
Speaker 1: They also make like dedicated gaming hand pads that I don't like those things that are shaped like a hand.

72
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:55,860
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're actually shaped like a hand.

73
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,990
Speaker 1: They're just kind of they've got buttons all over them.

74
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,079
Speaker 1: They're like a button pad.

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not I'm not a fan.

76
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:04,330
Speaker 1: I figure hold out like a year and then I'll get an OLED one and I'll be all set forever.

77
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,679
Speaker 0: Basically, I'm not a fan of it.

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,410
Speaker 0: You know, I sort of changed my philosophy.

79
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,128
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan of anything that's weird and custom because then when you're in a situation where you don't have it What are you gonna do?

80
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,673
Speaker 0: right, so if you get used to playing like PC games with your weird hand thing and then you go to like some tournaments somewhere and Sure enough.

81
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,161
Speaker 0: They don't have the weird hand thing.

82
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,609
Speaker 0: Well, what are you gonna do with your regular hand?

83
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:28,449
Speaker 1: The mouse I have at least gets around that the mouse holds all the configs in it.

84
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, so no matter where I go no matter what I like that mouse.

85
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:31,910
Speaker 1: It's so great.

86
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,530
Speaker 1: I took me a long time to like configure it and tweak it and I'm still tweaking it.

87
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,010
Speaker 1: I have a profile for every individual game and it's cool.

88
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,081
Speaker 1: They have all these rules like alright in every game.

89
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:47,158
Speaker 1: set the mouse sensitivity to zero Unmodified and then make all adjustments in this program.

90
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,909
Speaker 1: set the windows sensitivity to this because this means zero.

91
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:53,363
Speaker 1: So it's all 100% in the mouse.

92
00:03:55,072 --> 00:04:05,597
Speaker 1: Mmm, of course that leads to some weird problems because Bioshock the mouse because the sensitivity is so low as far as Bioshock sees Basically doesn't work in the menu.

93
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:07,683
Speaker 1: But once I start playing it's perfect.

94
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,790
Speaker 1: That's because Bioshock's written shittily, I guess.

95
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:11,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's stuff like.

96
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:15,650
Speaker 0: that is always weird with games like because not every game is programmed the exact same way.

97
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,459
Speaker 0: Like my logitech mouse.

98
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:23,429
Speaker 0: in the if you go to logitech settings There's a checkbox that says, you know, okay set some sense.

99
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:28,009
Speaker 0: There's a sensitivity bar and then you can choose do you want to use this one or the windows one?

100
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,192
Speaker 0: Right or both.

101
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:33,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then there's a button that says okay when you start a game What do you want to do?

102
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:36,970
Speaker 0: Do you want to use this sensitivity the game sensitivity the window sensitivity, right?

103
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,190
Speaker 0: But it the detection of when you're running a game is not the greatest.

104
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:52,850
Speaker 0: so sometimes it thinks you're playing a game when you're not and sometimes your thinks you're not playing a game when you are and Sometimes they'll get trapped like it'll know you started playing a game, but it won't know you stopped and your sensitivity is black.

105
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,790
Speaker 1: So I remember I had a lot of problems.

106
00:04:55,871 --> 00:05:06,329
Speaker 1: I made a custom thing because no one had a good one to actually Change between the sensitivity for a mouse and the sensitivity for a joystick inside of tribes - yeah tribes - could let you.

107
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,045
Speaker 0: because basically, you know other games the you know the.

108
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:15,803
Speaker 0: if you opened up the The terminal in the game the command prompt like in quake it was like a quick.

109
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:19,564
Speaker 0: it's quick language, you know in Tribes, it was basically C++.

110
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,749
Speaker 1: But I couldn't get that to work too.

111
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:33,770
Speaker 1: Well, so I found an external app that was meant for all games any game that had vehicles and walking But it would pretty much hose my computer every time I stopped playing tribes and I'd have to reboot.

112
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:39,249
Speaker 1: It says something about the priorities in my life that back then that the obvious solution was.

113
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,669
Speaker 1: well I'll just reboot every time I finish playing a game.

114
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course those days are back a little bit a little bit cuz.

115
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,790
Speaker 1: I've been playing games like every day when I get home.

116
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,002
Speaker 0: I've been playing Street Fighter 4 a lot.

117
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,965
Speaker 0: Not every day though.

118
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:58,036
Speaker 0: I haven't played it since last week So I played again probably tomorrow.

119
00:05:58,097 --> 00:05:59,221
Speaker 1: What tier are you?

120
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,284
Speaker 1: Are you top tier yet?

121
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,950
Speaker 0: I'm on the lowest possible tier.

122
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:02,980
Speaker 1: Can you check out of?

123
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:03,929
Speaker 1: I don't even know I?

124
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,313
Speaker 0: Well, I can.

125
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:10,890
Speaker 0: I know that if someone throws me and I throw them at the same time Then it'll say technical and make a little blue swirly.

126
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:12,761
Speaker 1: So what does that mean?

127
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,810
Speaker 1: What's the gnosis there?

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,956
Speaker 0: That means that you did basically you do the same thing as the other guy at the exact same time I hit him in the exact same spot.

129
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:21,187
Speaker 0: then it basically like cancels.

130
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:37,214
Speaker 0: It's like So if a guy's trying to throw you right you can't really block because you can throw someone who's blocking you can jump away from Them right, but then you're jumping away from them and maybe they'll like shoot a fireball real quick and you'll land on it And that'll hurt.

131
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:47,257
Speaker 0: so if you know He's gonna throw You just push throw at the exact same time because you saw the throw coming a mile away and it'll make a blue swirly And then you're right next to him.

132
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:49,870
Speaker 0: You didn't get thrown and then you can make a move, huh?

133
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:57,775
Speaker 1: So you got any gaming news because I don't really have any gaming news other than the fact that Pax East is almost sold out.

134
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,650
Speaker 1: There's only 600 tickets as of like four hours before we recorded this.

135
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,970
Speaker 0: You know anime Boston is the week after Pax East, but we're not talking about it nearly enough.

136
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:08,630
Speaker 1: Now we're going to anime Boston too, but none of you care because this is Tuesday night.

137
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,450
Speaker 0: You know, there's gonna be gaming in anime Boston, too.

138
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,130
Speaker 0: So, you know if you like anime even a little bit you should hang around the town all week.

139
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:18,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, but me and Scott are gonna be around Boston even more awesome.

140
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:20,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, anime Boston is gonna be pretty badass.

141
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,769
Speaker 1: Of course, it sells out almost every year, doesn't it?

142
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:24,193
Speaker 0: I think so.

143
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:24,936
Speaker 1: Pretty sure it does.

144
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:25,839
Speaker 1: It has big lines.

145
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,485
Speaker 1: For all I know it's already sold out.

146
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:28,650
Speaker 0: It deserves its big lines too.

147
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,510
Speaker 1: So it does say one thing about Pax though, and you know, they've got Reed and everything behind the scenes But the Pax Hotel.

148
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:39,846
Speaker 1: They got much better rates from the local hotels than anime Boston was able to get.

149
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,810
Speaker 0: And they get free internets.

150
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the Pax policy.

151
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:44,767
Speaker 1: If you stay in a Pax Hotel, free internet no matter what.

152
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,507
Speaker 0: Yep And if the Pax Hotel doesn't do free internet, not a Pax Hotel.

153
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:48,989
Speaker 1: Yep.

154
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:55,208
Speaker 0: So yeah, I got a little bit of gaming news Dominion, very popular game lately.

155
00:07:55,228 --> 00:08:08,150
Speaker 1: Yep Of course we had the problem that the game as fun as it was with the basic decks at least boiled down to Just make a money machine and then buy provinces or buy the witch and then make a money machine.

156
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,816
Speaker 0: Basically every time we play Dominion a whole bunch with all sorts of combinations of cards from the regular set and from intrigue And all sorts of different people.

157
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:17,250
Speaker 1: It wasn't just like a feedback loop like we've often run into.

158
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,919
Speaker 0: Well, not all sorts of different people but enough different people.

159
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:33,360
Speaker 0: and basically what happened is we determined that in order to win you should only buy like a handful of action cards and Get mostly money and then as soon as you have enough money buy all the provinces or buy duchies if you can't get provinces

160
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Speaker 1: Unless the game has too many attack cards and then you basically had to kind of go in for the long slog and buy duchies.

161
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was like a lot of cards were sort of useless.

162
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,812
Speaker 0: Let you know like do you really need like the Chancellor or whatever?

163
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,740
Speaker 0: Maybe not really, you know.

164
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,465
Speaker 0: So whatever.

165
00:08:51,546 --> 00:09:04,417
Speaker 0: so there was a seaside expansion that I knew existed but we hadn't gotten yet and I played it recently at a board game night a couple weeks ago and I played the seaside expansion and I'm playing right and I'm just.

166
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:05,220
Speaker 0: I'm just like, you know what?

167
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,400
Speaker 0: I looked around the all the ten cards because we played with all seaside cards, right?

168
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,789
Speaker 0: And I looked at all the cards that were on the table and I picked one that I thought looked kind of interesting like the ghost Ship, which is which is sort of nice card.

169
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:22,850
Speaker 0: So I'm like, okay, I'll get I'll just buy some ghost ships and Silver and gold and I'll be in this business, right?

170
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:34,207
Speaker 0: So I bought the cars that sort of had obvious uses and You know, I started getting lots of money and I bought a province and the next turn I bought another province and I was like fuck.

171
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,090
Speaker 0: Yes, that's right.

172
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:35,773
Speaker 0: These morons.

173
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,900
Speaker 0: They were buying action cars like nuts, right?

174
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:40,369
Speaker 0: And another turn goes by.

175
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,383
Speaker 0: I didn't get a province the next turn I didn't get a province.

176
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,159
Speaker 0: again the turn after that this dude bought a province and a duchy on the same turn.

177
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:55,540
Speaker 1: See I think what happened there is that it got the game got to the point to where there were enough Combos to where if you you can have this is only seaside cars.

178
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,754
Speaker 0: This isn't have any Dominion or intrigue cards except for coppers and curses and we know whatever.

179
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:00,517
Speaker 1: but think about it.

180
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 1: in the basic game It comes down to the fact that if you have eight money You should buy a province because that that's like just the way it works.

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,980
Speaker 1: But you can't really build up enough momentum fast enough to do anything crazier.

182
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,459
Speaker 1: There's no like late game because someone will end the game right away.

183
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:24,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in seaside what they added was that some of the cards are orange and if a card is orange That means you play it and then it stays there and it does something next turn also.

184
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:29,820
Speaker 0: So like the caravan you play it and You get plus one card plus one action.

185
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:40,238
Speaker 0: So it's basically you know You just play them like crazy because you play one you draw a card you play another caravan you draw a card you play You play all your caravans that are in your hand and then the next turn.

186
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:45,060
Speaker 0: If you let's say you played five caravans the next turn you start by drawing five cards.

187
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,459
Speaker 0: So your turn begins with you having ten cards in your hand.

188
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:52,940
Speaker 0: All right And there's a bunch of cards that basically they stick around for one turn and do something on the next turn.

189
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 0: One card that I thought was the most interesting was the Treasury.

190
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:57,043
Speaker 0: I don't know.

191
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,453
Speaker 0: I can't I don't have the specific exact wording of it.

192
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:04,532
Speaker 0: Basically the way it works is You play it and it gives you some money, right?

193
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:15,812
Speaker 0: And then if you Don't buy any victory cards right at the end of the then at the end of the turn all the treasuries that you played They don't go in the discard pile.

194
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:16,799
Speaker 0: They go on top of the deck.

195
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:21,560
Speaker 0: So basically what happens is if you have like five treasuries, they'll be on top of your deck.

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,498
Speaker 0: You draw all five and I think they let you draw a card.

197
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:39,199
Speaker 0: so then you're drawing five more cards and you basically have this pile of like ones that sits on top of your deck and you Keep redrawing them every single turn because they go right back to the top of the deck every time Until you eventually you buy a victory card, then they all get shuffled back in.

198
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:43,500
Speaker 0: So it's like you can get six treasuries or even you don't even need six.

199
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,017
Speaker 0: You just need like three treasuries and then draw three gold every turn.

200
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:50,529
Speaker 0: and you buy gold Three monies and you buy gold.

201
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:56,280
Speaker 0: you buy gold you buy gold you buy as many gold as you want You buy gold every turn and then eventually when you're satisfied you have enough gold.

202
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:00,860
Speaker 0: Let the treasuries get shuffled back in by a province by province by province by province.

203
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:06,807
Speaker 1: Right, well what's interesting is the game kind of had stages and each expansion Gave us more.

204
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:11,193
Speaker 1: gameplay like the original dominion was fun And then you know our group solved it and then there's more stuff.

205
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,619
Speaker 1: and oh now we got to do different off.

206
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,655
Speaker 1: now We solved it and then there's more saw.

207
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:15,320
Speaker 1: now we solved it.

208
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:26,454
Speaker 0: I want to get the seaside because the seaside makes the action cards just a little bit more powerful so that they're actually more Worthwhile than just buying silver and gold but as another dominion expansion that's coming out.

209
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:28,380
Speaker 0: This is the news called alchemy.

210
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,920
Speaker 0: I suspect it will involve turning things into other things.

211
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:33,604
Speaker 1: I'm excited.

212
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:34,248
Speaker 1: Dominion has.

213
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:42,400
Speaker 1: every time I've started to Peter out and think yeah I'm kind of done with this game and expansion fixes every concern I have and makes the game brand new to me all over.

214
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's kind of cool is?

215
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:46,504
Speaker 0: it's like it's not collectible But you use.

216
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:49,320
Speaker 0: they're still making big money off you because you're buying expansions.

217
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:52,240
Speaker 0: But that's okay because it's not collectible, right?

218
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,860
Speaker 0: I just buy the expansion and I'm done and I don't care if there's a hundred expansions or not because it's just you know.

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,173
Speaker 1: But think of this already.

220
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:04,080
Speaker 1: there are more Combinations than any human could ever play if they devoted their entire life from birth to death playing Dominion.

221
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,700
Speaker 0: The thing is most of the combinations are the same.

222
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:06,821
Speaker 0: It's.

223
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:12,520
Speaker 0: you know, if I play with these nine cards and I switch one out It's depending on which one I switch out probably not making a big difference.

224
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,568
Speaker 1: Well, it'll come down to.

225
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,117
Speaker 1: does this game have the witch or not.

226
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:20,829
Speaker 0: Yep So yeah, Dominion alchemy is coming.

227
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,419
Speaker 0: Dominion seaside is good, you know.

228
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,463
Speaker 0: Get all four sets mix them up have an awesome time Awesome.

229
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:31,040
Speaker 1: So I got a couple of quick minor geek bites.

230
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,643
Speaker 1: There's really nothing in the news that I cared that much about though There was that whole.

231
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:38,798
Speaker 1: the prison won't let the prisoners play D&D anymore because they think it's gang related.

232
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,633
Speaker 0: Whatever Yeah, and there probably is like a D&D prison gang or something.

233
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:43,436
Speaker 1: That's kind of awesome.

234
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:46,075
Speaker 0: I know I figure I just let those guys out.

235
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:46,640
Speaker 0: I'd be like you're good.

236
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:49,880
Speaker 1: I think I should email or I should just send a regular letter to that prisoner.

237
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,589
Speaker 1: I mean that I found all the info on him.

238
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can send letters to prison.

239
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:57,720
Speaker 1: I should be like, hey Burning, can you send them books if I can burning wheel?

240
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:12,783
Speaker 1: But I've been playing two games, you know I'm not gonna talk about counter-strike and I want to kind of get out my first impressions because they're games that I never actually Played before and I probably should have of course Psychonauts.

241
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:14,455
Speaker 1: well for sideshow knobs.

242
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:20,740
Speaker 1: It's like you That's that's one of those games that no one really knew about except the people who were like hardcore about it.

243
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,886
Speaker 0: It's sort of like earthbound.

244
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,435
Speaker 0: it's like there's a whole bunch of people who are like fuck.

245
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,869
Speaker 0: Yeah Fuck.

246
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,341
Speaker 0: Yeah But you know if you actually look around not that many, you know But it's.

247
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:29,542
Speaker 0: it's.

248
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:33,197
Speaker 0: it's one of those games of this like a loud internet voice for it and no other voice.

249
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:43,380
Speaker 1: like no one I get the game that I'd always heard of my whole life, but until Yahtzee talked about it I didn't know anything about it other than there's a game called psychonauts that some of our friends won't shut the fuck up about.

250
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:48,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I played it for a few levels, but that was about it.

251
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:50,142
Speaker 0: I was not really Excited.

252
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:57,353
Speaker 1: yeah, well the thing is it's one of those games that gets a thousand points for style kind of like Brutal legend, I don't know.

253
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,745
Speaker 0: maybe it gets 500 points for style.

254
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,951
Speaker 1: it gets not as many points as brutal legend.

255
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:05,300
Speaker 1: brutal legend has the biggest disparity between style and gameplay.

256
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:06,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh my god.

257
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:11,140
Speaker 1: It pains me that brutal legend is not just a move is completely non brutal.

258
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:11,583
Speaker 0: It should.

259
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:16,954
Speaker 1: it should have just been an animated directed DVD movie Oh my god, or even just a live-action movie with Jack Black in it.

260
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:18,260
Speaker 0: who knows whatever.

261
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:21,960
Speaker 1: Maybe some Harryhausen eska puppets and claymation sure.

262
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:28,040
Speaker 1: But anyway, I mean, I don't know the game has just enough dark humor and all that to where I really like the style

263
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:28,961
Speaker 0: And I

264
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:35,294
Speaker 1: don't know if it's because I haven't played a 3d platformer in a long time But it's it's filling in an itch that I've had for a long time.

265
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,460
Speaker 1: That was wasn't scratched.

266
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, the 3d platform That's the main.

267
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:50,640
Speaker 0: the reason I never like finished the game is because the 3d platforming this of it is like not The greatest in my opinion, you know compared to say a mario 64 or mario galaxy or something like that.

268
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,743
Speaker 1: That's my conundrum.

269
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,367
Speaker 1: The last 3d platformer.

270
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:57,999
Speaker 1: I played was mario 64 and then DS and I played halfway through sunshine.

271
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,284
Speaker 1: I was kind of dropped it.

272
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,172
Speaker 1: I never played galaxy.

273
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,220
Speaker 1: I'm kind of behind on 3d platformers.

274
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,928
Speaker 1: So I have a feeling that everything I'm getting out of the sideshow knots I'll get it a thousand times more over.

275
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:12,380
Speaker 1: if I just play like a Nintendo 3d platformer then I won't care about the game anymore.

276
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,607
Speaker 1: So yeah in the spirit of riding the smaller roller coasters before I ride the bigger ones I'm going to finish precise show knobs first.

277
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:24,340
Speaker 0: Yeah when I played the site show knots I had already ridden the bigger rollercoaster.

278
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:29,640
Speaker 1: Of course, we'll see a lot of people say that like once you get later in the game, there's weird and cool stuff.

279
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's a go guy gar situation right there.

280
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,096
Speaker 0: that I am NOT.

281
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:34,000
Speaker 1: We'll see.

282
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,690
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play your game kids and I tell you what.

283
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:42,594
Speaker 1: if there is nothing surprising in this game I'm going to be very disappointed with every one of you who's?

284
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:43,900
Speaker 0: I don't think I don't think anyone's lying.

285
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,674
Speaker 0: I think there is something later in the game that's different but at least like the first three or so levels I played It was not there.

286
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,139
Speaker 0: It was later.

287
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:54,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is people aren't gonna say, you know that like.

288
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:58,900
Speaker 0: I don't doubt that the later episodes of go guy Gar good as good as people say, you know, I don't think they're lying.

289
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,698
Speaker 0: I just think that it's you know, I got better things to do.

290
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,758
Speaker 0: then You know go through a whole big show or skip a whole bunch of episodes and be confused.

291
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:07,319
Speaker 1: Well, it's simple.

292
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:19,905
Speaker 1: What if would Mario 3 be as good of a game if in order to get to the actual first level of Mario 3 You had to be hide lied No See angry video game.

293
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:20,528
Speaker 0: nerd did highlight.

294
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,351
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

295
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:23,260
Speaker 1: I kind of want to play highlight again.

296
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:26,471
Speaker 0: I want to basically make highlight only not crappy.

297
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:29,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'd like was by default It's crap.

298
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,660
Speaker 0: All you have to do to make highlight not crappies play The Legend of Zelda?

299
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:38,005
Speaker 0: Well, no, you just make highlight slower and actually make the sword come out just like Zelda But keep that same map and stuff.

300
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,660
Speaker 1: So just make a Zelda see that has that map exactly.

301
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,840
Speaker 0: But I like the way the highlight looks with the with the screens, you know.

302
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,320
Speaker 1: And then I think you forget what is little mazes what it's like to actually play on that.

303
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:52,475
Speaker 0: No, that's nuts because the game the controls are all fucked up.

304
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:55,366
Speaker 0: you move around way too fast You can't tell when you're attacking and defending.

305
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,996
Speaker 0: if you just fix the controls and attack or defend.

306
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,425
Speaker 0: No, you got.

307
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:04,200
Speaker 0: it actually has to be pressed once to attack once and you know what I'm talking about.

308
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you change that part it would probably be alright.

309
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:14,080
Speaker 1: But I feel like I'm gonna play psychonauts now Before I play other games that remind me why it's not the best game in the world.

310
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:22,316
Speaker 1: But I start to understand why people were so obsessed with it for when it came out The camera was amazing compared to similar games.

311
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:23,440
Speaker 0: Oh, that is true.

312
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,506
Speaker 1: Is that the camera is great compared to any other game I can think of from any part of that era Mmm also.

313
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,553
Speaker 0: remember though you're playing what I'm like steam, right?

314
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:32,975
Speaker 0: Yeah.

315
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,560
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of people played this thing.

316
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,972
Speaker 0: I'm like ps2 and such so it's it's a different experience.

317
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:38,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

318
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,987
Speaker 1: I mean I got my Xbox controller Screen HD.

319
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got it right here.

320
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:51,593
Speaker 1: All right in fact I'm hooking up my computer to my TV because it's on the other side of the room in the living room and I'm gonna use The wireless controller and I'm gonna play all these games on the TV.

321
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:52,155
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

322
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,059
Speaker 1: I'm excited about this.

323
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,635
Speaker 1: He's got a run an HDMI cable right through that wall.

324
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:56,379
Speaker 1: We'll see how that goes.

325
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,659
Speaker 0: Good luck with it.

326
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:14,740
Speaker 1: the other thing I'm playing is all those old total war games that my computer couldn't handle before because my fan of those I'm a fan so far but I feel like Everything that feels like it's strategic is actually just letting me win.

327
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:18,968
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean I played the demo of like the first one ever when it was new.

328
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:24,640
Speaker 0: right and Basically, the demo has you do the combat where you're controlling like these big armies and formations.

329
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,540
Speaker 0: You got archers and pikemen and all sorts of stuff right out, but then right I actually watched someone play like for reals.

330
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:34,310
Speaker 1: They just grab all the troops and send them straight in yet.

331
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,060
Speaker 0: And and basically they never actually went into the combat.

332
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,799
Speaker 0: They just play the game on the map and they just let the combat be like auto because that doesn't matter.

333
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:43,180
Speaker 1: It gives me that option.

334
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:46,743
Speaker 1: But I don't know that the whole point of the game is to learn like Formations.

335
00:19:46,783 --> 00:19:50,376
Speaker 0: right but that part doesn't matter because you just win if your army is the right size.

336
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,400
Speaker 0: You just play the map game.

337
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:54,148
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm playing just that's the reason that I was like.

338
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:57,940
Speaker 1: well fuck that I'm playing just the actual combat apart.

339
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,400
Speaker 1: I'm playing through all the historical things and the history is okay, and I feel like you can learn some stuff.

340
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,040
Speaker 1: But so far, uh, you learn more from reading the Wikipedia article on infantry tactics than you do play in this game.

341
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see.

342
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:12,468
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

343
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:20,250
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it more of a go but the game is just not nearly as Interesting or strategic or tactical or anything is.

344
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,322
Speaker 1: a lot of people have made it out to be because people can't tell when you Know.

345
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,472
Speaker 0: you just put up the.

346
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,420
Speaker 0: it's like security.

347
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:32,875
Speaker 0: You just put up the illusion of security and people believe that there's a care where you know Regardless of whether that act whatever that is makes them more secure or not.

348
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,080
Speaker 0: It's the same with strategy.

349
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,499
Speaker 0: You just put something up that looks strategic and people believe you've made it more strategic whether you have or you haven't.

350
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,400
Speaker 1: Yep, like I tried this one scenario a bunch of times and I realized there's guys on the wall.

351
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,382
Speaker 1: So I sent archers in to basically pepper the walls where these other archers are to keep them away while my battering rams and ladders go up.

352
00:20:50,905 --> 00:21:08,891
Speaker 1: and I tried with and without the archers over and over again and I'm pretty sure that the archers had zero effect at all because it just made more goons that got killed on the top And it's kind of just a glorified hard-to-control tower defense game Mmm, or tower offense but not impressed so far.

353
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,740
Speaker 1: Give me another month and I'll say I'm not impressed again.

354
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,738
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

355
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:23,661
Speaker 1: what do you got for me?

356
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:28,583
Speaker 0: I got another funny webcomic I found called Scott meets Family Circus.

357
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:29,429
Speaker 0: no relation to me.

358
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:50,810
Speaker 0: This guy's name is Scott Gerdner and basically what he does is he has a little Tumblr blog and he makes a little comic and on the left side of the comic he puts up an actual Family Circus comic which I'm sure is probably illegal, but he's parodying but he's also reproducing, you know He's putting up the original and his parody together as opposed to just the parody.

359
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,950
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if this falls into like a Garfield - Garfield situation or not.

360
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,090
Speaker 0: But anyway on the right side, he puts a parody of that exact same comic.

361
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:06,338
Speaker 0: so it's a pretty funny take on the Family Circus and I laughed at it and rim also lulled.

362
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,622
Speaker 0: so it's pretty good.

363
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:08,184
Speaker 0: Check it out.

364
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:12,582
Speaker 1: It's no John Hey But it's good.

365
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:17,730
Speaker 1: Hmm So my thing of the day is not gaming related, but it's just too cool to not talk about it.

366
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,055
Speaker 0: I think it any wasn't gaming related.

367
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:20,059
Speaker 0: You ever heard of Family Circus?

368
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,284
Speaker 0: video game, of course.

369
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:22,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

370
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:28,308
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just I always think back to that Perry Bible Fellowship parody of Family Circus.

371
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:29,030
Speaker 0: That's the best.

372
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:40,570
Speaker 1: But Bill Watterson the the reclusive author of Kelvin and Hobbes Which to this day is regarded by most people is one of the greatest if not the greatest newspaper strip in the history of newspaper strips.

373
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:49,450
Speaker 1: There's an interview with him online which might not seem that crazy until you realize that there really aren't interviews with him ever anywhere.

374
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:54,259
Speaker 1: He and the thing is it's not like he's a hermit necessarily he just he's just normal guy.

375
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:59,807
Speaker 1: his neighbors all respect his Anonymity and he just lives in his town and they do reporters ask about him.

376
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:01,235
Speaker 1: They just say yeah I'm not gonna tell you.

377
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:08,890
Speaker 0: so basically, you know, he's not like Like Steve Ditko who like won't appear, you know, this guy goes the grocery store and shit.

378
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,190
Speaker 0: He just doesn't want to talk to anybody and it doesn't want to be bothered by fans.

379
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:22,290
Speaker 0: He just wants to be able to live a normal life without you know Like a Hollywood situation or salesman or business people constantly body just wants to be able to live a normal life.

380
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:36,619
Speaker 1: But what's really cool is that by and large not like a loner who hides away and doesn't talk to anybody, you know He's such a respected individual that the press and almost everyone involved has respected his Desire to remain mostly private.

381
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,828
Speaker 0: and I haven't respected if people are trying to find him.

382
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:39,450
Speaker 0: Oh, they just can't.

383
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:41,478
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

384
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:47,735
Speaker 0: if you really want in the problem No, but the problem is if you try to if you try to go after him the wrong way You just won't get anywhere.

385
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:50,450
Speaker 0: He just won't talk to you and it's like well, what did you get?

386
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,286
Speaker 0: You got a picture of him walking down the street.

387
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:53,937
Speaker 0: big deal Yeah, but there was.

388
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,150
Speaker 1: you didn't get any videos of people like chasing him.

389
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:57,301
Speaker 1: I'm sure if people try.

390
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:58,290
Speaker 1: there were two videos of chasing.

391
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,666
Speaker 0: I don't think that's gonna happen because then if you try to do that you could go to like jail.

392
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:03,570
Speaker 1: now, it's okay.

393
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:10,255
Speaker 1: It's fine to chase people with a microphone as long as you're not threatening them with the microphone Waving it over your head somehow.

394
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:14,550
Speaker 0: I think that the local police in that area would have a disagreement regardless of what the law.

395
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:19,650
Speaker 1: Maybe they just murdered anyone who went anywhere near him and buried the bodies.

396
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:21,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, right next to cow.

397
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,750
Speaker 1: Anyway, this article.

398
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:29,770
Speaker 1: It's really cool to finally hear some of his thoughts on why Calvin and Hobbes was popular and what he was thinking in it.

399
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,856
Speaker 1: It's about what you would expect but I'll note.

400
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:39,020
Speaker 1: the picture of him in the article is a semi stock photo from 1986. they didn't take a picture of him.

401
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:40,426
Speaker 0: He emailed him.

402
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,270
Speaker 0: He didn't even go see him.

403
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:42,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

404
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:43,470
Speaker 0: How's he gonna get a picture?

405
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,411
Speaker 1: I don't know.

406
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,259
Speaker 1: Bob telephoto lens camp out Google Maps.

407
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,683
Speaker 0: the thing that I the most.

408
00:24:48,864 --> 00:25:11,190
Speaker 0: the other the only more recent thing I guess the second most recent thing I've seen in terms of trying to find him was a guy who like Ended up in like a diner in his town and he's pretty sure that he saw him in the back room At a table talking to someone like in the you know the dining room But he couldn't confirm or deny whether it was him or not and the people in the restaurant wouldn't help him out at all.

409
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,859
Speaker 0: So and that was sort of like as far as he got.

410
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

411
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,083
Speaker 1: I just thought it was cool.

412
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:15,645
Speaker 0: Yep.

413
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:22,609
Speaker 0: So meta Minute is the off-forgotten meta minute metamucil.

414
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:27,080
Speaker 0: No Okay, so what meta things do?

415
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,686
Speaker 1: you're the one who reminded me to do it.

416
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:29,590
Speaker 1: you got nothing to say.

417
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:30,836
Speaker 1: What's all this?

418
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,163
Speaker 1: What the fuck Scott?

419
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,350
Speaker 0: Well, this Pax East.

420
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:36,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pax East is probably already sold out.

421
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,490
Speaker 1: But if you want to go to Pax you didn't pre-register and you're not going to pre-register right now.

422
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,276
Speaker 0: You're done and there's anime Boston.

423
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:45,723
Speaker 1: anime Boston might already be sold out.

424
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:46,325
Speaker 1: I don't know.

425
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:47,890
Speaker 1: you should go pre-register for that, too.

426
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,068
Speaker 1: It's right after Pax.

427
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,446
Speaker 0: There is the mocha the mocha arts festival the weekend after that right after anime Boston.

428
00:25:55,467 --> 00:26:00,022
Speaker 0: Yep Do I was like what the one that's a week after that Nexus.

429
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:00,927
Speaker 1: some atheist thing.

430
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:01,530
Speaker 1: it's a ways off.

431
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,614
Speaker 0: It's some skeptic thing.

432
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:03,698
Speaker 0: I don't think it's an atheist thing.

433
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,606
Speaker 1: Well, I think the two are hand-in-hand.

434
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:06,550
Speaker 0: No, not necessarily.

435
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:10,641
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people who believe in the jeebus, but also don't like fake medicine.

436
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:13,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then they're not skeptical enough.

437
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,436
Speaker 0: There Is I'm gonna update the website.

438
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:24,410
Speaker 0: you're reaching soon with some stuff and rim is still not doing any e-commerce.

439
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:27,483
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm having enough trouble with these new microphones in the new computer.

440
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,889
Speaker 0: You could have done the e-commerce first.

441
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:33,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could have but the old computer as I learned when I tried to boot it to put up a show.

442
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,961
Speaker 1: We recorded and it didn't boot.

443
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:37,842
Speaker 1: I Changed computers about the right time.

444
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:38,346
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

445
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,875
Speaker 0: Sure Okay, that's good enough.

446
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,203
Speaker 0: It's supposed to be a moment.

447
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:45,536
Speaker 0: It's not supposed to be the meta hour Yep, nothing else.

448
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:46,961
Speaker 1: And then that was there was a little bit.

449
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,558
Speaker 0: I for someone who was so prepared to do the man I just want to start remembering you do it every time.

450
00:26:51,698 --> 00:27:02,230
Speaker 0: Oh, oh the book club selection is still Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and you should read that first book only and the next Thursday show.

451
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,135
Speaker 0: That's what it's gonna be.

452
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,530
Speaker 1: Well, you're allowed to read the rest of them, but we're not gonna talk about.

453
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:15,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if rim doesn't read it by the next Thursday show, we're gonna do it anyway, and it's gonna be lulls Rim sucks, I'll do it from my memory of like 12 years ago.

Speaker 1: It's not a long book now and you know, you guys should read read.

458
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:31,190
Speaker 1: Yeah I Get the impression people don't read many of the books we're doing and I'm pretty sure most of the people that were looking point of Doing the book club is to make people read.

459
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:40,583
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure almost all of you who are looking forward to the next geek night's book club show on the hitchhiker's guide Are only looking forward to it because you already read the book a long time ago.

460
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:42,170

465
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:10,650

469
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,834
Speaker 0: however, it is not but it's not exactly a board gaming night either I'll put it this way.

470
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:37,685
Speaker 1: It is not a gaming con, but it is bigger than several gaming cons I have been to.

471
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:44,312
Speaker 0: yeah There were like a hundred something people there and it's two full days of gaming from like 11 in the morning to 11 at night Ish.

Speaker 1: We I will only went for one day and for two days.

474
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:56,577
Speaker 1: But in general if you guys you know You always want us to do the geek nights con and we're getting there where you know We got a lot of others probably gonna be pretty similar to that Basically a room full of tables.

475
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,328
Speaker 0: hang out for a day, you know play games Yep.

476
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:09,258
Speaker 1: But if you want that Desperately and you're not willing to wait for us to get to it and it's not at the top of my queue by any stretch If you go to these things, we're there.

477
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:14,422
Speaker 1: you can just pretend it's a geek nights event, even though it's not Yeah, there was a listener there said hi to us.

478
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:17,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were a couple listeners I ran and I'm also you know, I'm starting to.

479
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,970
Speaker 0: you know, like I've been going to these things.

480
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,710
Speaker 0: So I sort of you know, I'm becoming some friendly with some of the repeat attendees, you know, I can recognize them.

481
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,553
Speaker 0: They recognize me.

482
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:31,516
Speaker 0: I know a few of their names, you know, I know who likes what games, you know There's some guys or it's like.

483
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,304
Speaker 0: we know, you know, we're the sero guys.

484
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,469
Speaker 0: We always played the sero.

485
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:36,417
Speaker 0: We got things going on.

486
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,989
Speaker 0: So it's it's a good group of people's there.

487
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:40,231
Speaker 1: Yep.

488
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:43,783
Speaker 1: I mean the only big thing I did was play a paranoia game.

489
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:47,399
Speaker 1: This is the third paranoia game I've played in my entire life.

490
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:57,890
Speaker 1: Oh man as much as I love paranoia I'm not one to put forth the effort to run it because I have other things I want to run and Not that many people run it let alone.

491
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,937
Speaker 1: Well, so I mean what.

492
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:06,379
Speaker 1: we had that LARP at RIT that we were both in like the tabletop paranoia LARP And I played it once halfway.

493
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,643
Speaker 0: I mean, it wasn't a LARP.

494
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,228
Speaker 0: It's just it's sort of a half LARP.

495
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:09,830
Speaker 0: It's a LARP.

496
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,330
Speaker 1: Well, I usually I call that a tabletop LARP where you're LARPing and that you're all first-person.

497
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:18,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the rules are fast and loose, but you're still all sitting around a table.

498
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:20,056
Speaker 1: It's just like instead of dice.

499
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:23,370
Speaker 0: There are some physical elements involved like props.

500
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,300
Speaker 0: It's basically a tabletop RPG with props.

501
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:30,470
Speaker 1: Yep, but also drop some of the dice and Oftentimes people like in paranoia like zap.

502
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,792
Speaker 0: They'll use the mechanic of if you want to shoot someone you yell like a gun at them and you go your finger guns And you go zap.

503
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:40,229
Speaker 1: Yep, and then everyone goes zap all at once and if you don't immediately zap at someone you didn't shoot.

504
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:45,605
Speaker 1: Whoever has the most finger bangs pointed at them dies.

505
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,350
Speaker 1: I like that mechanic a lot.

506
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,330
Speaker 0: It's a little bit of mafia mechanics there.

507
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,441
Speaker 0: It is werewolf for those of you who are heathens.

508
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:53,250
Speaker 1: the guy around the game was pretty awesome.

509
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:58,670
Speaker 1: He ran just as well as Luke only without the tabletop LARP element with Morgan.

510
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:05,750
Speaker 1: Yes, and the cool part is I ran it You know, I played in it and Emily played in it with me and she had never played paranoia before.

511
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,213
Speaker 0: Did you have the soda now?

512
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:07,815
Speaker 0: We didn't do this.

513
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:08,376
Speaker 0: What the hell.

514
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:18,717
Speaker 1: she didn't know anything about paranoia other than it's kind of Logan's runny and weird and Computer the colors nothing.

515
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:22,630
Speaker 0: She didn't really didn't know about the computer and the colors of being happy communist or anything.

516
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,965
Speaker 1: She pretty much knew all the stuff, you know from us.

517
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:27,897
Speaker 1: talking about the game She never read the books or played it or anything.

518
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:30,045
Speaker 1: So so we started as blue.

519
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,896
Speaker 0: We played as like oh shit I played anything but red.

520
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:33,880
Speaker 1: It was great.

521
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,410
Speaker 1: I gotta tell you I was yeah, you could do fucking crazy show.

522
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,490
Speaker 1: Oh my god, we went into the fucking position equipment.

523
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,523
Speaker 1: We went into R&D and I was like, I want exploding everything.

524
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:43,367
Speaker 1: and they're like, here you go.

525
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:43,889
Speaker 1: And here's a nuke.

526
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:45,761
Speaker 1: Yeah that nuke.

527
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:47,190
Speaker 1: we had a total party kill.

528
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,775
Speaker 1: In fact, we had two total party kills because not only did the whole party die But because then the nuke went off.

529
00:31:53,236 --> 00:31:57,989
Speaker 1: the computer NPC party that was sent to kill all of us was also killed.

530
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,330
Speaker 1: nice But she had no idea was going on and we're blue.

531
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:04,750
Speaker 1: So, you know I bust into the R&D department with all these reds and yellows.

532
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,096
Speaker 1: I'm like, give me all your fucking shit.

533
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:08,727
Speaker 1: and then I killed them all because they were clearly communists.

534
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:10,913
Speaker 1: Of course It was great.

535
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:12,698
Speaker 1: I love paranoia so much.

536
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:13,300
Speaker 0: Let's see.

537
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,347
Speaker 0: What game did I play Saturday?

538
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:16,490
Speaker 0: I'm trying to even remember.

539
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:17,073
Speaker 1: We played Dune.

540
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:17,334
Speaker 1: that was it.

541
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:17,615
Speaker 1: we came in.

542
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,981
Speaker 0: we played Dune the board game.

543
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, we played first, you know, I've done a whole show on.

544
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,150
Speaker 0: so should we really discuss it again?

545
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,270
Speaker 1: I got there before Scott got there.

546
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,001
Speaker 1: So me Alex Jess and Emily are all there.

547
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:29,330
Speaker 1: and you know, I had via plenty.

548
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,778
Speaker 1: So we just played it with some guys.

549
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,827
Speaker 1: All right the via plenty and then those two guys, you know We're talking to him like hey, you want to play Dune and they're like, what's Dune?

550
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:37,992
Speaker 1: and we did the thing We always do.

551
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:40,664
Speaker 1: well Dune is an asymmetric, you know all the stuff that makes you go.

552
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,106
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

553
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:41,869
Speaker 1: I want to play that game.

554
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:48,169
Speaker 1: So we all sat down and we played a full-on game of Dune all the way to the end.

555
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:50,082
Speaker 1: I don't think we've only done that.

556
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,170
Speaker 1: I think once before.

557
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,940
Speaker 1: Yeah We always kind of stopped halfway through Or we don't have a full loadout or whatever.

558
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,218
Speaker 0: trying to remember what I was playing while you were playing Paranoia because I was at the next table.

559
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:00,760
Speaker 0: Oh, all right.

560
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,199
Speaker 0: I was running my t and e. I ran t and e. That's what I was doing.

561
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,349
Speaker 1: Didn't you also run doom?

562
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:14,890
Speaker 0: No, they accidentally put my name on that but no But yeah, no, I ran a t and e. I taught some people to play t and e. there was one guy who was German.

563
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,881
Speaker 0: He already started knew how to play so he sort of crushed it.

564
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,450
Speaker 0: one guy was cool, but he didn't really.

565
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,476
Speaker 1: He did not grok the fullness.

566
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:23,740
Speaker 0: Oh, he slowly he grok'd.

567
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:30,043
Speaker 0: he grok'd more than that guy at anime Boston, but He didn't catch on until you know sort of halfway through.

568
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:36,910
Speaker 0: the other guy sort of knew what was up But he was you know, he definitely had the potential but it was his first time playing so you couldn't beat the you know.

569
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,804
Speaker 0: And then there was that guy's the second guy's girlfriend who was sort of like.

570
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:44,813
Speaker 0: well, you know She just sort of she was like she you know She.

571
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:52,557
Speaker 0: I think she liked the game But she just sort of got tired of not being able to make progress or figuring out how to make progress and getting crushed By the guy who was good.

572
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:53,964
Speaker 0: So she was just sort of like whatever.

573
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:54,768
Speaker 0: Let's just get this over with.

574
00:33:55,631 --> 00:34:04,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, one thing I can say about our Doona game though was that you know Normally you play at a con like this and if your game goes long and people have like another game They should be playing.

575
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,785
Speaker 1: you can tell a lot of games.

576
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:06,710
Speaker 1: You'll see people sitting around.

577
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,355
Speaker 1: They're all antsy.

578
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,463
Speaker 1: Like I just want this to end.

579
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:09,370
Speaker 1: I want to go do something else.

580
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,958
Speaker 1: This was not what I was bargaining for.

581
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,025
Speaker 1: This wasn't as good as I thought.

582
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:12,770
Speaker 1: whatever that is.

583
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,409
Speaker 0: The problem is that I think a lot of gaming cons, right?

584
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:20,090
Speaker 0: They do this game registration thing Which is where you got a at a certain time.

585
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:28,906
Speaker 0: They open the registration and you got to sign up and say what game you're gonna play and then you have to start playing That game at that time and then you're in that game until it ends.

586
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:33,201
Speaker 0: you've committed to it And you know, this is sort of a traditional gaming con thing.

587
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:38,478
Speaker 0: all gaming cons are like this, you know But I think you just shouldn't do it at all.

588
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:40,185
Speaker 0: Just have open gaming period.

589
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,088
Speaker 0: don't have any.

590
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:47,449
Speaker 0: you know If someone might want to schedule a game like say I'm running this at X o'clock, right?

591
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,400
Speaker 0: But don't do registration just so.

592
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,290
Speaker 1: how do you deal with the fact that all right, I'm running paranoia?

593
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:57,063
Speaker 1: I mean you saw like a hundred everyone lined up way before the afternoon signups.

594
00:34:57,224 --> 00:35:02,125
Speaker 1: The paranoia game was full at me Yep, and everyone behind me was like damn it.

595
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:03,090
Speaker 1: I wanted to play paranoia.

596
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:08,290
Speaker 1: So, what do you do when I schedule my paranoia game and there are 60 people standing there who want to play?

597
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:14,510
Speaker 0: I think that what you do is you just have table and first first to sit down.

598
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,230
Speaker 1: So the fat guy sits down at noon and just waits all day.

599
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:25,260
Speaker 0: Or better yet, right the guy running the game just chooses who he wants to be in the game.

600
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:29,250
Speaker 0: Because I think a lot of the times what happens especially with an RPG, right?

601
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:36,430
Speaker 0: But the signups is that the person who signs up is the person who's you know The crazy guy who's gonna wait in the front of the line.

602
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:43,437
Speaker 0: It was not necessarily gonna be the best at the game or have the best Resulting game experience in the RPG.

603
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,206
Speaker 0: So you don't really want that guy in your RPG.

604
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,230
Speaker 0: He's gonna make it less fun.

605
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,125
Speaker 0: You want to pick who's gonna make it the most fun.

606
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,123
Speaker 0: So Just pick just be a jerk.

607
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,775
Speaker 1: I think you should have both I think open gaming and sign up.

608
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,261
Speaker 1: gaming have places especially.

609
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,405
Speaker 1: remember these are you know?

610
00:35:57,706 --> 00:35:59,331
Speaker 1: sit down play a German board game for a Couple hours.

611
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:01,919
Speaker 1: These are four to six hours of like.

612
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,792
Speaker 1: I am dedicated to this and the game only has a certain number of slots And all that.

613
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:10,150
Speaker 0: That's the other thing is sometimes, you know, like Alex and Jess they signed up for something.

614
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:18,510
Speaker 1: yeah, it uh Basically, I kept looking over at their table and we're playing paranoia like got one dude on the party is turning into a werewolf.

615
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,339
Speaker 1: So he starts to like howl cuz.

616
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,430
Speaker 1: he can't hold it in and to cover up for that in character.

617
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:34,559
Speaker 1: he starts singing the bouncy bubble fountain food beverage theme song from the commercials in the game and we all start singing and Everyone at that table kind of looks over at us.

618
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,050
Speaker 1: Like I want to be over there.

619
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:45,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think Alex said that basically he was playing Spirit of the Century which is a game that has a lot of hype and I'm pretty you know, but Apparently someone was right at the game.

620
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,380
Speaker 0: like the default theme in the game is like 20s Indiana Jones pulp adventure which I'm totally all about.

621
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:52,965
Speaker 0: but it seemed like Alex.

622
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:56,095
Speaker 0: they were using the system to play A D&D dungeon with.

623
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:57,819
Speaker 0: you know, kill kill the rats.

624
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,650
Speaker 1: That's like the opposite of the point of our beyond D&D panel.

625
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,080
Speaker 0: So Alex was.

626
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,910
Speaker 0: he was basically like yeah, you know He couldn't really tell if the system was actually good or not.

627
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:18,888
Speaker 0: and I'm I don't know about that system because it gets a lot of hype but the book is very large and Whatever, but you know He had not a good time in that particular instance of the game because it was just here's the trouble.

628
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:20,554
Speaker 1: and you have the same Thing at like anime con.

629
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:28,841
Speaker 1: so you've got a panel right say you walk into the panel expecting whatever and it's totally lame And you're like one of four people sitting in the room.

630
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:31,290
Speaker 1: You just get up and walk the fuck out.

631
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,740
Speaker 1: Yes, what if you're the only guy in the room?

632
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,884
Speaker 0: Yes, definitely.

633
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:42,969
Speaker 1: So gaming cons though It's much harder to do that because one, you know, it's like if you walk out of a panel You're not hurting the panel.

634
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,697
Speaker 1: You might hurt the panel's feelings But you're not hurting the panel.

635
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,170
Speaker 1: you walk out of a game that only had six slots.

636
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:52,766
Speaker 1: You are hurting the game and everyone playing in it and the feelings of the guy running.

637
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:53,670
Speaker 1: It's like a twofer.

638
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:57,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you committed to six hours of that game.

639
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:58,410
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do now?

640
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,395
Speaker 1: All the other games are full.

641
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:00,621
Speaker 1: you can go to open gaming.

642
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,330
Speaker 1: But now, you know, you're not having the same experience.

643
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:04,908
Speaker 1: What are all the people who are gonna play in that game gonna do?

644
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,412
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

645
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:11,370
Speaker 1: I don't know how to get around that except maybe every game should have a 15 minute, you know.

646
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:19,490
Speaker 1: Let's start and play and then after those 15 minutes Every game in the entire con stops has a 10-minute break and you're allowed to not come back.

647
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,387
Speaker 0: I think one good way to do it his is is a possible solution.

648
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:23,748
Speaker 0: You're right.

649
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:29,730
Speaker 0: The thing is is that you know, it takes preparation and efforts to run an RPG, right?

650
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:40,709
Speaker 0: And the thing is most people want to play in like these particular awesome RPGs But there's only a few people will run them and those people will only run like one and that's it.

651
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:44,570
Speaker 0: He won't run it like three or four times right like we will because we're nuts.

652
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:54,597
Speaker 0: But you should do is you should just have it RPG con and you say everyone who's coming to this con must bring prepared RPG right.

653
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:05,304
Speaker 0: and basically what you do is you get a group of people and one of you starts running your game and At any time, you know, you know, who's gonna play in your game.

654
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,909
Speaker 0: if everyone's running games You don't run them all at the same time.

655
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:12,722
Speaker 0: You take turns running games and you keep shuffling and mixing it.

656
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:15,170
Speaker 0: if someone's game sucks cuz you know people's games will suck.

657
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,810
Speaker 0: In fact, most of them will you know everyone, you know, most people don't have the GM skills.

658
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,230
Speaker 0: They know they don't have the GM skills, but they come prepared with a game.

659
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:34,115
Speaker 0: Anyway, maybe they come prepared with like oh, I'll say my baby at least right and you know You can just stop playing game and start one at any time because as long as you can just get people together Someone's got a game.

660
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:42,069
Speaker 0: Maybe someone who had a fun game will run their game twice You know if they start with one group and then maybe they'll get you know shift to other people and so that way it.

661
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:42,390
Speaker 0: you know.

662
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:58,690
Speaker 0: Basically, people are constantly starting playing or stopping playing RPGs the whole time and everyone's got something prepared So that you know no matter, you know, you won't get in a situation where it's like well There's five people free, but none of us are GM's, you know, everyone's gonna get prepared to GM something.

663
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:03,459
Speaker 1: Well, if you want to fit it in more with the the way these cons already work I think a compromise.

664
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:23,392
Speaker 1: take the idea of you know The games all have like a 20-minute introductory period where like everyone sits at the table, you know goes over all the stuff They're gonna do and then you have the break and at the break anyone who wants to leave a game goes over to the games that they want to join and then if you don't leave your game then you just come back to the game that you want to stay in and Then any.

665
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:25,560
Speaker 1: if you go to a game and there's an open slot you get in.

666
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:36,890
Speaker 1: if you go to a game and it's full Or whatever then you keep reshuffling, you know You have this whole like 20 minute period Where eventually everyone's in a game they want to be in or they've bailed completely on the games that sucked.

667
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:38,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's another thing.

668
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:39,770
Speaker 0: It's like I was playing T&E, right?

669
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,960
Speaker 0: I was teaching and then running it for people like I didn't even play.

670
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,120
Speaker 0: I just taught it and then sort of watched and helped and there are people who were just looking for games to play.

671
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:54,502
Speaker 0: but my game was full because it only had four seats and I was like listen just sit and learn how to play.

672
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:58,283
Speaker 0: you don't need to write, you know Even though you can't play they're like no they don't.

673
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:03,747
Speaker 0: they didn't want to right Like if I couldn't get into an RPG, I'd be happy like to sit there.

674
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,257
Speaker 0: but it's like nope There's X slots and that's it.

675
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:09,690
Speaker 1: go out, you know, so I don't know might be a difference in culture.

676
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,191
Speaker 1: I mean we're.

677
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:23,310
Speaker 1: we spend most of our gamer time at either anime con gaming or like generic on you know Like Dragon Con kinetic on style gaming where it's kind of geeks all playing games as opposed to gamer only people playing games.

678
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:31,432
Speaker 1: The crowd at the recess was definitely the Gen Con crowd and not the dragon con or kinetic on or packs or any of that Crowd.

679
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:31,895
Speaker 0: I don't know.

680
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:34,470
Speaker 0: I have a feeling dragon con is also sort of the Gen Con crowd.

681
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:40,710
Speaker 0: I think so But not as much as much a little bit different because Dragon Con has all these sort of different tracks.

682
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,362
Speaker 0: I think dragon is technology.

683
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,354
Speaker 0: It's got skepticism It's got all sorts of.

684
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:50,821
Speaker 1: I would guess based on what my friends to go to Dragon Con say that half the gamers There are paxi kind of gamers and half the gamers.

685
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,110
Speaker 1: There are Gen Con kind of game is anyway.

686
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:54,955
Speaker 0: So is that all you did?

687
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:55,336
Speaker 0: Saturday?

688
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:57,182
Speaker 0: was you played the paranoia and that was it.

689
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:59,870
Speaker 1: pretty much paranoia and dune and hanging out.

690
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:06,470
Speaker 1: Sadly, you know Saturday night we all you know, the our games all ended We all got together and they had the cool party at this bar down the street.

691
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,019
Speaker 1: So like oh, yeah, let's all go down.

692
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,789
Speaker 1: We have a drink say hi to everyone then go home.

693
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:16,370
Speaker 1: We go down there and the stupid bar wanted a $5 cover charge and not paying five bucks to walk in say hi and leave.

694
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially considering that the bar for five bucks.

695
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:20,890
Speaker 0: I can get like five candy bars.

696
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:26,070
Speaker 1: Sadly the bar looked like it was general admission and all the other bars around weren't super crowded.

697
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:32,205
Speaker 1: There was no real reason for that cover charge Except for the fact that they're trying to game five bucks off of all these gamers who wanted to.

698
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:35,839
Speaker 0: there's no cover charge If we would have gone over earlier when the other people went over.

699
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,573
Speaker 1: so the cover charge started right as the event We were all leaving ended.

700
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:41,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's awesome.

701
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who's who is responsible for setting that up But not well executed apparently.

702
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:52,480
Speaker 0: they just weren't that many other places to go like, you know, they didn't choose, you know It's like there was no real choice of place.

703
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have been having even on Sunday, right?

704
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:02,897
Speaker 0: So on Sunday, I went out just looking for a place to eat, you know for lunch and it was surprised How many places were just closed?

705
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:07,113
Speaker 1: Well that part of Brooklyn is definitely not super happy or sit-down What are you talking about?

706
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,044
Speaker 0: That is like the Happeningist area in Brooklyn.

707
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:09,829
Speaker 0: That's where all the shit is.

708
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:12,078
Speaker 1: But right around there no bars.

709
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:13,363
Speaker 1: No restaurants open on Sunday.

710
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,090
Speaker 0: The restaurants are open there to sit down.

711
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:17,721
Speaker 0: I'm talking about walk in get food lunch kind of place.

712
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:18,284
Speaker 1: Oh, whatever.

713
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,590
Speaker 1: I mean there was that muffin place.

714
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:21,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not really lunch.

715
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:23,686
Speaker 1: That is dead paninis and all sorts of stuff.

716
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:24,530
Speaker 1: That place was awesome.

717
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:31,542
Speaker 0: Anyway, so on Sunday, I went back and in the morning I signed up to play Starfarers of Catan.

718
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:35,884
Speaker 1: remember we played that that's a good game Except that it's kind of broken once you've played it too many times.

719
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:41,798
Speaker 0: Yeah with the encounters Yeah, but if you don't know what the encounters do it's real fun I think is we sort of messed up the game.

720
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:48,089
Speaker 0: We played it a little bit wrong, you know in that We deployed the beginning colonies like incorrectly or whatever.

721
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:53,990
Speaker 0: But you know in remembering how to play I was like, oh, yeah this game is a good game.

722
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:55,557
Speaker 0: And now I kind of want to like.

723
00:43:55,939 --> 00:44:04,070
Speaker 0: I think that that's really it, you know I've sort of wanted to play settlers, but then I keep remembering that like yes settlers is kind of broken and bad.

724
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:06,830
Speaker 0: You know, it's like settlers itself sucks.

725
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:16,230
Speaker 0: So I definitely I think I want to get back and try to do Star fairs or cities and nights and start playing that because you know to revive the settlers and thisness of it.

726
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:25,270
Speaker 1: One thing that was interesting I kind of I miscalculated and that I hope to recruit a whole bunch more Pax East enforcers at this con or at this event.

727
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:29,703
Speaker 1: So, you know, I went around I was talking to people and surprisingly almost everyone I talked to.

728
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,978
Speaker 1: the conversation was along the lines of well What's Pax?

729
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,349
Speaker 1: What's Pax East?

730
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:36,805
Speaker 1: What do you mean it like e3?

731
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:37,048
Speaker 1: What's e3?

732
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,500
Speaker 1: Penny arcade like they did I there's a huge.

733
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,727
Speaker 0: the thing is there what the there is.

734
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,999
Speaker 0: I know that you know That's not everybody.

735
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:47,370
Speaker 0: You didn't get like a goods.

736
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:48,195
Speaker 1: No, it's not like.

737
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:50,850
Speaker 0: I asked everyone to the con company when I was at the board game night.

738
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:56,330
Speaker 0: There was a girl I talked to and she was there and she told me that she made like the first penny arcade website.

739
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:58,798
Speaker 1: Wow I would pretty much say that I talked.

740
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:03,440
Speaker 1: I asked about to 10 people 10 or 11 people and Two of them that I talked to.

741
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,281
Speaker 1: you know, my small sample size Knew what was up and the rest of them had never heard any of these things.

742
00:45:08,884 --> 00:45:09,045
Speaker 1: Hmm.

743
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:10,190
Speaker 1: It was just interesting.

744
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,888
Speaker 1: It's kind of like you go to an anime con and everyone at least knows what comics are and you go to like.

745
00:45:14,592 --> 00:45:18,126
Speaker 1: You go to like a bigger gaming con and like I had the trivia remember.

746
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:21,018
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The trivia.

747
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:22,650
Speaker 0: so we do this trivia, right?

748
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,977
Speaker 0: And so we're first we.

749
00:45:24,118 --> 00:45:26,050
Speaker 0: it's it's just front row crew people on a team.

750
00:45:26,151 --> 00:45:27,445
Speaker 0: But then we got some other people on.

751
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:27,910
Speaker 1: it was great.

752
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,403
Speaker 1: We named a team that had nothing to do with that.

753
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:31,690
Speaker 0: We couldn't think of a team name.

754
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,350
Speaker 0: So we went with the Ozamanga Diode team name of C cucumber.

755
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:38,010
Speaker 0: But then they broke our team up because there are too many big teams.

756
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,450
Speaker 0: So suddenly we were back to just FRC people again and some other team was team C cucumber, right?

757
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:48,450
Speaker 0: But then the people that split up from us were no longer on team C cucumber.

758
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:56,570
Speaker 0: So actually some people were on team C cucumber and none of them had chosen that name Right and our team ended up being named big fire.

759
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:03,038
Speaker 0: but I think next time we have to go with experts of just I think experts of justice is a more Profound and awesome sounding name.

760
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:05,610
Speaker 0: and then there was one guy who we didn't know who was on our team.

761
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,486
Speaker 0: Also, however, he filled out a lot because we did not have the knowledge that he had.

762
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:15,326
Speaker 1: round one was geek And pretty much every team got all of them, right or almost all of them, right?

763
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:19,582
Speaker 1: Yep round two We had almost nothing because it went right into nerd.

764
00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:21,550
Speaker 1: We had we were done at that point.

765
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, we're like.

766
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:27,570
Speaker 0: all the questions were like aimed at not us not us at all except the whole time.

767
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,210
Speaker 1: We're like, wow, there's like no anime questions here at all.

768
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:36,365
Speaker 1: We're pretty much boned unless they ask about like old-school gaming or old-school like anime.

769
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:48,754
Speaker 0: and then they ask one question Hooked on okay and everyone our whole table is like what and the whole rest of the room is like what the fuck They went back to like.

770
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:49,918
Speaker 0: what's the name of the do?

771
00:46:50,299 --> 00:46:51,704
Speaker 1: what's the name of this Harry Potter thing?

772
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:53,290
Speaker 1: or what's the name of this?

773
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,701
Speaker 1: Thing from the dark tower that I've never actually read.

774
00:46:55,721 --> 00:46:57,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all these good.

775
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,958
Speaker 0: There's questions about like wheel of time and stuff.

776
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:03,690
Speaker 0: I mean Alex could cover some of the fantasy, but even he couldn't cover all of it.

777
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the one Silmarillion question, but it was deeper like it was such.

778
00:47:07,308 --> 00:47:11,407
Speaker 0: it was like What was the name of the dog they used to find like I don't fucking remember.

779
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:14,470
Speaker 0: I read that book And I was yes, why can't the answer be a Luvitar?

780
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

781
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:18,103
Speaker 0: I know you could have asked a hundred questions about the Silmarillion.

782
00:47:18,144 --> 00:47:19,550
Speaker 0: that would have gotten but they asked like.

783
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,875
Speaker 0: You know one of the thousand questions I would not have gotten but at least that's.

784
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:32,690
Speaker 1: what makes a good trivia is if they gave every question, you know 95 percent of the answer but only the true nerds know the extra five percent.

785
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like one of the asshole.

786
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:42,390
Speaker 0: they had these asshole questions and one of them was like, you know name all the superheroes That were on this cover of this comic and I was like, uh, it was a defenders comic.

787
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,061
Speaker 0: So I'm like trying to guess and I know some of the defenders.

788
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:47,130
Speaker 0: I got like doctor strange, you know.

789
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:55,583
Speaker 0: And the thing is like I probably could have gotten it with enough time, but it was just like duh Like they played a sound from a video game and they're like they didn't ask.

790
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:56,728
Speaker 1: what video game is this.

791
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,809
Speaker 1: they ask Specifically what action is happening right now?

792
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the dig dug.

793
00:48:00,954 --> 00:48:03,525
Speaker 0: one like if they played a sound clip from dig dug.

794
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:04,810
Speaker 0: that didn't sound like dig dug.

795
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,766
Speaker 0: It sounded like you know frickin like space some space shooting game or something.

796
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:11,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, even rim didn't know it.

797
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,780
Speaker 0: It was dig dug.

798
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:14,196
Speaker 1: I know of course Honestly, I played dig does.

799
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:17,629
Speaker 0: he would have gone like if they would have gone doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

800
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,270
Speaker 1: Then I would I had dig dug immediately, but that's the difference between a geek and a nerd question.

801
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:27,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the other one he was burger time and I was like, it's just burger time, duh But I couldn't tell what the action was.

802
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,183
Speaker 0: Yes, like is it?

803
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:29,870
Speaker 0: is it when he's peppers the bad guy?

804
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,668
Speaker 1: well, I thought it was peppers, but I realized I think what screwed me up there?

805
00:48:32,688 --> 00:48:36,378
Speaker 1: I Only really played burger time on the Intellivision.

806
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:38,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, not on the arcade.

807
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:41,325
Speaker 0: I totally bite you totally bite you.

808
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:48,298
Speaker 0: but yeah We sucked ass at the trivia and we want if we had like some of our other FRC people's there we probably would have done a lot better.

809
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:48,780
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

810
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,496
Speaker 0: Yeah between like katsu Pete Nury You know cater Adam there.

811
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:53,676
Speaker 0: They.

812
00:48:53,696 --> 00:48:56,283
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean why is the trivia master?

813
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:58,830
Speaker 1: There was some old like Warhammer questions.

814
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,545
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got like they were like what planet are the ultramarines from?

815
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:10,742
Speaker 0: and like the one guy We didn't know when any FRC had any clue right but the random guy the strange guy He was like it was like lotrim are.

816
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,010
Speaker 0: but no was ultramar.

817
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:13,990
Speaker 0: It was like Pete would have had that in like a second.

818
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pete in fact would have punched all of us for not knowing it.

819
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,208
Speaker 0: Yeah that the ultramarines are from ultramar.

820
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:21,010
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, we feel stupid.

821
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,977
Speaker 1: But anyway, it was a good time.

822
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:24,961
Speaker 1: It was really well run.

823
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:25,783
Speaker 1: the questions were good.

824
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:27,709
Speaker 1: I like the whole asshole question thing.

825
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,417
Speaker 1: Oops banging into your microphone.

826
00:49:30,558 --> 00:49:31,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, my headphones banged into him.

827
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what else you have to say.

828
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,027
Speaker 1: I just thought it was a super.

829
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:38,626
Speaker 0: well I I need to talk about what I did and the reason I went back on Sunday.

830
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,494
Speaker 0: The primary reason was Later on Sunday.

831
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:48,639
Speaker 0: I basically felt like a complete moron waiting in the front of the registration line, you know But I did wait in that front of registration line.

832
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:51,130
Speaker 0: I ran out to lunch came back and got in the front of the line.

833
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:57,888
Speaker 0: Also everyone liked oshi who I played it with oshi was pretty popular because people didn't know it But they loved it when I played it with them.

834
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:10,670
Speaker 0: but I signed up and played free market for reals with Jared and these three other dudes and I am prepared to to spill all sorts of beans about free market, which which beans would you like to be spilled?

835
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:11,596
Speaker 0: I don't know.

836
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,429
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what I want to know about the game.

837
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:19,585
Speaker 0: Okay, basically the way free market goes is it's the new RPG from Lucre and Jed.

838
00:50:19,665 --> 00:50:21,730
Speaker 0: Jared Sorenson team up it.

839
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,688
Speaker 0: The pre-orders are gonna be in March.

840
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:33,117
Speaker 0: There's no dice and it goes something like this so you're on the space station and The space station gives you everything.

841
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:36,930
Speaker 0: There's a computer on the space station, but it's not like Hal or the paranoia computer.

842
00:50:37,774 --> 00:50:41,130
Speaker 0: It just sort of is brain, you know, it doesn't have any motivation or anything.

843
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:45,891
Speaker 0: it just sort of provides everyone with food in the basics and That's it.

844
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:48,578
Speaker 0: So you have to get the idea.

845
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:50,162
Speaker 0: the game is to get flow.

846
00:50:50,443 --> 00:50:56,802
Speaker 0: you got to get flow and the way you get flow Is by you know doing various things like.

847
00:50:57,063 --> 00:51:01,379
Speaker 0: you can friend people friending people, you know if people become your friends you get flow.

848
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:07,169
Speaker 0: if you will give you like smiley faces or You know doing various things you can get flow, right?

849
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:25,140
Speaker 0: so you got to get flow and So you have this character and your character has experiences interface Technology and memories and these things are what you use to get flow right and memories Turn into experience in this whole thing.

850
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:36,010
Speaker 0: All right, so you basically All the people all the players join a mercy a Merc Z Right, and that is your group and your group has some sort of objective.

851
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,156
Speaker 0: So it can just be whatever the hell you want.

852
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:39,660
Speaker 0: Like you can just anything.

853
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,410
Speaker 0: All right, so ours was like fucking teeth.

854
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:46,946
Speaker 0: I think we called it like guts and gums and we're just like yet fucking teeth.

855
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:47,830
Speaker 0: That's what we care about.

856
00:51:49,772 --> 00:51:55,310
Speaker 0: And I was a. I was like a a cyber athlete of sorts, you know.

857
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,976
Speaker 0: And the other with jouster.

858
00:51:56,996 --> 00:51:59,224
Speaker 0: no, it was like we decide.

859
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:00,710
Speaker 0: we just came up with shit on the fly.

860
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:08,689
Speaker 0: so it was like it was called like schnoz ball or whatever and I didn't even make up what the sport actually was until I had to play it and what you know.

861
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:14,170
Speaker 0: But basically, you know, you were playing this game and we're like, okay, how do we start?

862
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,057
Speaker 0: So he's just like reading various like.

863
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:27,576
Speaker 0: he starts off by telling us what we have in our like little Mercies area because space is a commodity like physical space is like rare because the space station was designed for 40,000 But there's 80,000 people.

864
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:30,517
Speaker 1: So there's a movie.

865
00:52:30,637 --> 00:52:31,483
Speaker 1: there were 80,000, right?

866
00:52:33,272 --> 00:52:39,430
Speaker 0: So he's basically telling us like, you know This is the stuff you have right and we're like some and one of the things had to do with pets.

867
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:41,870
Speaker 0: So suddenly we start the game by going we got to make a pet.

868
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:52,130
Speaker 0: So we try to make this tooth fairy and The tooth fairy comes out all like nasty and gross and we're like, okay Well, let's let's make a movie with the tooth fairy.

869
00:52:52,491 --> 00:53:03,068
Speaker 0: That'll be like a wicked YouTube type meme and spread over the whole space station and somehow we managed to pull it off where the tooth fairy became wicked popular across the entire station.

870
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:12,333
Speaker 0: and suddenly people start calling us up like, you know, we created this mean people wanted to get like these pliers and pouches to pull their Teeth out or whatever.

871
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:15,724
Speaker 1: It all comes back to the Perry Bible Fellowship, right?

872
00:53:16,266 --> 00:53:19,724
Speaker 0: So we're like, oh shit We got to make these pliers and things.

873
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:22,958
Speaker 0: So Basically, we realized that we all sweet.

874
00:53:23,018 --> 00:53:25,490
Speaker 0: None of us had the printing experience, which means it sucks.

875
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:28,903
Speaker 0: We suck at making things which is why our tooth fairy came out all nasty.

876
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:37,530
Speaker 0: So I Called up the guy who makes my sporting equipment, you know, and I'm like we need you to make this thing for us.

877
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,617
Speaker 0: He's like, what are you gonna do for me?

878
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:40,669
Speaker 0: So basically I had to like.

879
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:43,888
Speaker 0: My rivals daughter was a fan of me.

880
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:49,710
Speaker 0: So he wanted, you know, but my rival was also a customer of his and he wanted to make my rival happy.

881
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:55,250
Speaker 0: So we took a memory out of me modified it and implanted it in my rivals daughter.

882
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:04,277
Speaker 0: So now she liked her father and not me and then I was in a sporting event with her father and I ripped his fucking Basically blew his teeth.

883
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:10,870
Speaker 0: I blew his skull in half and blew his teeth all over the crowd as we were Giving them all the pliers that they want.

884
00:54:12,632 --> 00:54:32,038
Speaker 0: So that's that's the kind of game that comes out of at a free market, but basically the way the game works is you have these cards and What the how you use how the challenges work use the cards to resolve the challenges and are really sort of crazy and incredibly difficult to understand way Which is I think a negative.

885
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,510
Speaker 0: but at the same time he said that they did it that way on purpose.

886
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:39,309
Speaker 0: So it's like they made the challenges intentionally complex.

887
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:47,194
Speaker 0: but even though the way the challenges worked with these cards and the conflict resolution and how many cards do you draw and what Do they do?

888
00:54:47,275 --> 00:54:48,910
Speaker 0: and how do you figure out who wins?

889
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:57,081
Speaker 0: Like you need like a reference sheet to learn figure this shit out like big time Even though that was really complicated for some reason.

890
00:54:57,121 --> 00:55:01,116
Speaker 0: the way the game worked the role-playing like came real easy.

891
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:09,690
Speaker 0: if you couldn't tell you know, huh and Like, you know, basically everyone gets like one of these sort of like attaboy tokens.

892
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:10,687
Speaker 0: That's sort of like, you know.

893
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:18,136
Speaker 0: Yeah If someone else does something awesome you throw your token at them and the rule is you only get one token per session to give To someone else.

894
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:23,430
Speaker 0: when you give it to someone they get flow But one person can only receive one token per session.

895
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:28,284
Speaker 0: So if you do ten awesome things in this ten players, you can't get nine tokens.

896
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:38,509
Speaker 0: You can only get one and you know, so Throughout the game like everyone threw their token at me at some point and I was after the first one I had to say like I already have one like three times.

897
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:43,725
Speaker 1: Well, we're kind of used to the whole burning wheel, you know crazy gaming stuff already.

898
00:55:43,745 --> 00:55:52,698
Speaker 0: A lot of people aren't yeah But I definitely you know, I have the PDF for free market and if I could just get the cards I am totally prepared to run this game.

899
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:53,421
Speaker 0: I think it is a game.

900
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:56,170
Speaker 0: I could definitely run with awesomeness.

901
00:55:56,551 --> 00:56:00,907
Speaker 1: I imagine we'll be running a lot of impromptu games at PAX East and anime Boston.

902
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:01,690
Speaker 1: We're just hanging around.

903
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,090
Speaker 0: I'm definitely planning to run free markets at PAX East because I know that a lot of people like one.

904
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,828
Speaker 0: I want to play it and there are not gonna be enough people running it.

905
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:14,486
Speaker 0: So I will run free markets there once or twice and I'll definitely run it at Connecticut and such.

906
00:56:14,566 --> 00:56:19,270
Speaker 0: but yeah That's it's free market is what it is.

907
