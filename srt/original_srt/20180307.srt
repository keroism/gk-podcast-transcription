9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,278
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

10
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:51,950
Speaker 1: So, uh last night the news was is gonna be some sort of ridiculous snowstorm in New York And I woke up in the morning assuming there was nothing.

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,046
Speaker 0: there was a tiny drizzling rain when I woke up But I went to work.

12
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,134
Speaker 0: It wasn't even raining.

13
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:57,000
Speaker 1: There was nothing.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,882
Speaker 0: No when I got to work it was wet, but like there was no flakes or anything There's.

15
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:04,016
Speaker 0: no it was not a storm as far as I could tell.

16
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:05,948
Speaker 0: usually Storms seemed like happen at night.

17
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:14,985
Speaker 0: like you wake up in the snow is there but in this case Got to work and while I was at work it started snowing, but even while I'm at work and the snow's coming down I look out the window.

18
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:17,095
Speaker 0: I don't see any flakes sticking anywhere.

19
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:28,520
Speaker 1: It's just wet everywhere Yep, but then just as I'm leaving I'm looking out the window and bit by bit I see it starting to stick and The few people who came into the office all sort of were like well and bad.

20
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:29,960
Speaker 0: I didn't see any sticking in Manhattan.

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,900
Speaker 0: But when I but I did see lots of wind and flakes blowing, but just not on the ground.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,320
Speaker 0: But then when I got to LIC and I came out of the ground there's actually snow and mush here everywhere.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it's way Colder than Manhattan even though it's just on the other side.

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,131
Speaker 1: Oh, it was started to stick in Manhattan while I was waiting.

25
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,100
Speaker 0: it was not a very large river either.

26
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:50,368
Speaker 1: I think it's just it.

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,980
Speaker 0: we crossed that threshold I don't know, but there was a lot of mush here.

28
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:56,619
Speaker 0: There was not even one flake on the ground in my work.

29
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,411
Speaker 0: Yep, there's a lot of annoying wind and flakes blowing in my face.

30
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,780
Speaker 1: Some lightning struck in the middle of all this.

31
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,760
Speaker 0: I kept hearing stories about you know thunder snow, but I did not see or hear any thunder snow.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:18,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, thunder snow was so prominent where I was that it startled the shit out of everyone in the at least on the floor I was on Like people ran to the windows like what just happened out there.

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,132
Speaker 0: I didn't see or hear any thunder snow only rumors of its existence.

34
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:21,353
Speaker 1: Yep.

35
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,377
Speaker 1: I encountered a full-on.

36
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:22,859
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool.

37
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,257
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah despite the weather we're here doing geek night, so it's Wednesday.

38
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,020
Speaker 1: you got any news.

39
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:29,814
Speaker 0: What was my news?

40
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:40,804
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah so one of like the best comics there ever was that everyone knows about if they care anything about comics is the Sandman by Neil Gaiman and It's mega popular.

41
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:45,680
Speaker 0: It keeps selling even though it's been you know, sort of done for years and years and years and years.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,299
Speaker 0: I read the whole thing long ago.

43
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:48,905
Speaker 0: Forget probably how.

44
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:52,980
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing that's always on the end cap at a bookstore if bookstores still exist near you.

45
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:55,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you go to any bookstore or comic store.

46
00:02:55,575 --> 00:03:01,652
Speaker 0: It's like they got it Yeah And someone's always some new kid teenager is discovering it for the first time.

47
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:04,500
Speaker 1: some it's always right next to like a copy of the Watchmen.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got.

49
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:06,329
Speaker 0: you know, it's got.

50
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,260
Speaker 1: a house is always on that same end cap.

51
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:11,500
Speaker 0: It's got some spin-off series out there and stuff like that.

52
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,549
Speaker 0: But vertigo that published it way back when vertigo wasn't dead Has been sort of off for a while now.

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,031
Speaker 0: and we talked about previously like way long ago about the the burger books cuz Karen burger burger.

54
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:25,474
Speaker 0: I don't know.

55
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:35,504
Speaker 0: I'm sorry She was the editor of vertigo for all those glory times and then she left and then vertigo dead basically effectively dead Not completely though.

56
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:40,920
Speaker 0: And now she's a dark horse doing those comics we talked about but I guess those haven't really come out.

57
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:49,066
Speaker 0: I think they're only like issued One of some of them and like three or four of others like I've been waiting for like a trade for any of those books And they have not come yet.

58
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:55,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they're going pretty slow over there, but There's a big news here that basically they're gonna.

59
00:03:55,691 --> 00:04:03,759
Speaker 0: I think it's like a new imprint like it's not vertigo Even though it was announced at a vertigo thing at Emerald City comic-con, which was like a week ago.

60
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:13,651
Speaker 0: That I think it's a new imprint called Sandman Universe comics And they've already got at least one issue with Neil Gaiman's involvement.

61
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:20,089
Speaker 1: a one-shot comic plotted by Neil Gaiman co-written by Nella happens in right Hopkinson.

62
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,480
Speaker 1: So basically they're gonna Howard etc, right?

63
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:30,636
Speaker 0: They're gonna try to re milk that Sandman Universe a gain As if the original wasn't enough.

64
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,446
Speaker 1: I'm not okay with this.

65
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:45,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I mean if you really wanted more Sandman's you didn't have enough Then it's your lucky day and Otherwise, I think it's interesting that like Are they gonna if this works?

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,324
Speaker 0: So they're gonna go back to the other successful vertigo things and like be like, all right We're now starting.

67
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:50,404
Speaker 0: why?

68
00:04:50,424 --> 00:05:03,320
Speaker 1: the last man universe and preacher universe and you know It's interesting because that's sort of the kind of thing that Underwear hero pervert comics try to do with their console to Sandman boots and reimagine.

69
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,439
Speaker 0: It's interesting because it sort of has this little bridge right between the set Sandman and the DC Universe.

70
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:25,380
Speaker 0: There's like this weird tiny space in between involving like you got like the house of mystery is sort of in the space in between there and you got like What else he got, you know little swamp thing mixes in there a little bit, right?

71
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,920
Speaker 0: And it's sort of like this this like some sort of multiverse barrier between the two.

72
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:40,569
Speaker 0: But they this leakage right and I think that's why you know, perhaps they're going for this Vertigo series don't have that leakage.

73
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:51,325
Speaker 1: We'll see though if this is done Well, it might set a precedent or if it's done Well, it might just do well and it doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the the path for every other property They can get their hands on.

74
00:05:51,446 --> 00:06:01,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's it's you know, it's weird cuz like usually Companies that try to revive series like reviving things that finished and it's like why you're reviving a thing That is done and done.

75
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,976
Speaker 0: Stop doing that.

76
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:02,480
Speaker 0: Leave it alone.

77
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:11,080
Speaker 1: I mean I never even bothered watching the like Madoka movie because the show was good and enough and I didn't want to even bother with any further story in that world.

78
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,850
Speaker 0: Well, actually all the Monica I looked it up.

79
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,622
Speaker 0: Most of the Monica movies are just Compression.

80
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:16,806
Speaker 0: Oh, no, but there is.

81
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,753
Speaker 0: but there is one that happens after.

82
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:21,569
Speaker 0: yep, that is not I didn't watch it But it's actually on Netflix.

83
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:22,739
Speaker 0: I put it I marked it.

84
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:29,420
Speaker 1: I don't want to see the continuing adventures of Shinji after the offensive Evangelion, right?

85
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,900
Speaker 0: But this is you know, it's sort of like people usually have a leave well enough alone kind of attitude.

86
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:40,500
Speaker 0: But Sandman was such a thing that like actually, you know, it doesn't have that feel of leave well enough alone.

87
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,110
Speaker 0: It has that feel of being large right and it was always, you know Moving about and in growing in it.

88
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:50,560
Speaker 0: even we're just reading the main series You can feel it growing and filling in more spaces.

89
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:56,068
Speaker 0: So it's like well if we're gonna continue something that you know Which you know is interesting because if you think about it.

90
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:59,662
Speaker 1: another recent property that has a very similar thing going on is actually Adventure time.

91
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:06,140
Speaker 1: Mmm adventure time has continued to just expand and fill spaces and go in different interesting directions.

92
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:08,674
Speaker 1: And even there they've said enough is enough.

93
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:09,539
Speaker 1: We're going to end it.

94
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:13,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have like all these adventure time comics and I have not read enough of them.

95
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,054
Speaker 1: I haven't even read all the pony comics and they don't have all.

96
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,120
Speaker 0: I have every pony.

97
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,694
Speaker 1: Every time I pick the pony comics up again and read like another trade.

98
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:22,079
Speaker 1: They're so good.

99
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:29,819
Speaker 0: Literally every issue of a complete run of pony comics Yeah, and I have not read even half of them.

100
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,064
Speaker 1: So I got.

101
00:07:32,085 --> 00:08:01,349
Speaker 1: it's not so much news, but this is something that's been in the anime discourse recently in a bunch of places and the answer man even jumped in on it, but basically in pop culture a number of sort of legit celebrities or Sort of more mainstream appeal people have been casually admitting that they watch anime And more importantly they've been casually admitting that they watch anime that so-called anime Nerds would consider inside baseball.

102
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:03,815
Speaker 0: I mean nerd gatekeeping is not new.

103
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:04,417
Speaker 0: Yeah,

104
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:20,015
Speaker 1: but what's interesting is That for the longest time like when I was now having an anime fan since I was in the fourth grade Which is before most of you listeners were born and all I ever wanted Was for anime to just be mainstream like everything else that I like like.

105
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:21,380
Speaker 1: I wanted to be out there in the mainstream.

106
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:22,186
Speaker 1: I didn't.

107
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:55,340
Speaker 1: I didn't want to have to go to like weird conventions to get my anime stuff or this like special section of blockbuster video or like weird fan sub crap like all the Ephemera of anime fandom was really just annoying to me because all I actually wanted was just for anime to just be normal Mm-hmm, and it basically is and has been for some time Mm-hmm, and I feel like just recently a whole bunch of anime voices Who are invested in that ephemera Looked up and realized that anime got way more mainstream than they'd expected.

108
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:59,420
Speaker 0: Well is the thing that applies to all geekeries or and is a common phenomenon for example?

109
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,187
Speaker 0: Did you know there was a recent soccer game right?

110
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,200
Speaker 0: they got better ratings in the United States than an NBA game, right?

111
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like.

112
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:13,400
Speaker 0: but do you see soccer represented on like any sports channel except the soccer specific channel?

113
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:27,660
Speaker 1: Not about any time eSports comes up in a mainstream conversation in the media Most of the commentary and response is why is this being talked about even though more people are watching that than watching?

114
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,883
Speaker 0: You know your world series.

115
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

116
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,089
Speaker 0: It's like the nerd.

117
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:39,734
Speaker 0: things are big, but they're not in the mainstream You know, they're not being talked about on ABC NBC CBS Fox.

118
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:44,425
Speaker 0: your main stream stuff, you know is not Recognizing the size of these things.

119
00:09:44,445 --> 00:10:01,104
Speaker 0: So it's like there's all these giant monsters of culture that everyone is watching but nobody knows because the you know There's like this, you know The media is not talking about these things and the people who are in the media don't know about these things Before.

120
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:05,620
Speaker 1: but look at like top-selling comics in America pretty with almost without exception.

121
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:16,520
Speaker 1: Every conversation about that at almost every level of media in the industry Pretends that manga doesn't exist and counts everything after that and there's a reason they do that actually.

122
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,125
Speaker 0: That's a good.

123
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:18,134
Speaker 0: a related thing.

124
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:27,131
Speaker 0: the New York Times for example got used to have this in the top-selling book list used to have this sort of like Graphic novel and manga sections and they got rid of all those.

125
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:33,555
Speaker 0: there was actually when they first added those those Controversy that they had to keep them separate because they lumped them together.

126
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:34,540
Speaker 0: It would just be all manga.

127
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:38,340
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be representing any of the non-mang, right?

128
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,281
Speaker 0: It's like this stuff is a way big and they just I don't know There's.

129
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:49,859
Speaker 0: no I don't think it's a conspiracy like Hebrew for knowing it's big but it's just because of the way You know media works.

130
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:55,957
Speaker 0: Right, the actual sizes of things have no relation to the amount of attention they get.

131
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:06,600
Speaker 0: Yep and I think the only thing that's more people more people go to an Otakon and say a Baseball game do yet and the baseball game can be on the big giant.

132
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,454
Speaker 0: You know news and the Otakon will be in like a tiny tiny article.

133
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:11,940
Speaker 1: I mean Otakon has its problems.

134
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:12,928
Speaker 1: I'm not necessary zone.

135
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:13,714
Speaker 0: You should do anything.

136
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:14,520
Speaker 0: as an example.

137
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:20,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, like when we were going to Otakon Otakon was bigger than Pax by a ridiculous margin.

138
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:25,113
Speaker 0: Yep, Otakon was bigger than those and even within the nerd media, right?

139
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,568
Speaker 0: The Pax would get bigger play than Otakon.

140
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:36,514
Speaker 0: Yep, right You know, but yeah so but the other thing besides just gatekeeping and people not realizing how big things are.

141
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:52,640
Speaker 0: the main attitude that I have a problem with is I remember one of my sister's friends had this attitude when she was like in high school and I was home from RIT for some reason and You know, they were talking about animes and the friend was like, oh, yeah cowboy bebop Was that's a cool show until everyone else started liking it.

142
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,386
Speaker 0: That is not cool anymore And that's someone who's like.

143
00:11:55,406 --> 00:12:03,280
Speaker 0: you're not judging the thing based on the quality of itself But based on you know, how many people like the thing?

144
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,280
Speaker 0: It's like it's only cool of a few people like it that hipster attitude.

145
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:08,720
Speaker 0: My band is only cool if it's not big enough.

146
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,904
Speaker 1: I just remembered the last time we videoed one of our panels of an anime Boston Remember.

147
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:19,680
Speaker 1: I captured that nerd Talking about that exact bullshit with his friend because he happened to be sitting near the microphone.

148
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:23,740
Speaker 0: Right that attitude is a bad attitude that you know.

149
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,829
Speaker 0: It's somehow the number of people that like a thing.

150
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:30,600
Speaker 0: when a thing becomes well known it is somehow Changed in its inherent qualities.

151
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,001
Speaker 0: It's like.

152
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:42,680
Speaker 0: no the quality of a thing is nothing to do with how many people like or dislike it the same way that a Fact does not become more or less true based on how many or few people believe it.

153
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,188
Speaker 1: There is one cut sort of nuance to that.

154
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:47,456
Speaker 1: in terms of a media you can consume.

155
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,720
Speaker 1: That is absolutely true.

156
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:53,739
Speaker 1: But in terms of a finite thing like say a magfest or a pax?

157
00:12:55,002 --> 00:13:01,979
Speaker 1: Yes, the number of people consuming it can affect the thing But in the terms of the more people like it the harder it is for anyone to consume it.

158
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:04,560
Speaker 1: Yes, there's a very limited amount of Pax West.

159
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,970
Speaker 0: That's how many people like your favorite kind of Apple.

160
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:15,020
Speaker 0: the price can go up and the the farms get right But in terms of something that is infinite, you know music doesn't degrade in quality if more people listen to it.

161
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, the sound waves of the concert hit everyone's ears.

162
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:26,140
Speaker 0: So I think that it might be annoying the concert ticket prices go up Or that you can only see this person at a large venue and not a small venue.

163
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:38,299
Speaker 0: Yeah But the music is the same music either way you like it or don't like it regardless of how many other people feel the same Way or differently, but I think the only reason this conversation sort of suddenly really like reemerge.

164
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:42,600
Speaker 1: We've definitely been on this track for a long time and this has been a constant evolution.

165
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,214
Speaker 1: A lot of people just watch anime and don't even think of it as anime.

166
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,760
Speaker 1: It's just something they watch on Netflix or whatever.

167
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:49,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone who has that attitude though?

168
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,260
Speaker 0: Or is trying to gatekeep and keep people from liking the same thing that they like you can all go to hell.

169
00:13:55,884 --> 00:14:15,931
Speaker 1: but I think what specifically happened is Main and I. recently there have been a spate of a smell of a number of mainstream celebrities Mentioning casually some anime they watch in the course of some unrelated conversation and a bunch of nerds picked up on that as being newsworthy Simply because they mentioned anime.

170
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,680
Speaker 1: and that seems to be worried.

171
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:39,079
Speaker 1: Like I'm seeing this conversation like circling to a degree that I haven't seen in like five plus years and it's sort of interesting but anyway things of the day, so I got a thing that is Weird, but it is the most interesting thing.

172
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,210
Speaker 1: I've seen you know, that's the whole idea of thing of the day.

173
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,460
Speaker 1: Like what's the most interesting thing you've seen?

174
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:58,826
Speaker 1: Since the last time you had your thing of the day like back when we started geek nights What I saw is this picture of a car and The car has a bunch of words all over the back of it the words of a crazy person.

175
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:04,690
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but the words Seem to imply that dogs cause cancer.

176
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:11,993
Speaker 0: That is not true because I know many people had cancer who did not have any like cancer dog for it's basically that is a child Get cancer.

177
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:12,837
Speaker 0: They don't have a dog yet.

178
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:15,530
Speaker 1: It is the time cube babies born with cancer.

179
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,593
Speaker 0: They were never near a dog.

180
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:26,923
Speaker 1: It is the time cube of cancer dog, and I really am Surprisingly invested in finding out what the hell the deal is with this.

181
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,570
Speaker 0: They're just a nutty delusional person.

182
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,329
Speaker 0: It's like I read a story last was a week or two ago about this.

183
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,730
Speaker 0: Someone grew up and there they kept moving homes and it was really weird.

184
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,650
Speaker 0: They didn't understand like like one day their mom threw out all the food in the fridge or something.

185
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:45,210
Speaker 0: It's like they had a weird childhood and they didn't know why until later in life.

186
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:52,220
Speaker 0: Their mom told them like oh, yeah, we've been on the run from the mob this whole time Oh, he doing witness protection stuff, right?

187
00:15:52,541 --> 00:16:00,190
Speaker 0: But then years later she found out Oh, no My mom actually just got involved with this other dude who wasn't my dad and that dude was totally delusional.

188
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:03,284
Speaker 0: I got my mom to believe this nut job story.

189
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,450
Speaker 0: That wasn't true at all.

190
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:12,146
Speaker 0: And then she looked it up and it's like yeah It's an actual like disorder that you can have where you're otherwise like a normal kind of.

191
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,430
Speaker 0: you know, you'd like person.

192
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:21,510
Speaker 0: you just have this crazy thing that you believe as if it's true and It's like this particular flag that gets to this person.

193
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,849
Speaker 0: It might not even be a nut job, but they might send on this one issue.

194
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,986
Speaker 0: They could be having that same thing where they're completely normal person who just believes in all their heart.

195
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:32,216
Speaker 0: for some delusional reason The dogs cause cancer.

196
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's always this like or they could be or they could be a nut job.

197
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:38,790
Speaker 1: It's always this like very specific type of Activision of activism.

198
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,022
Speaker 1: So because that's just weird.

199
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:45,769
Speaker 1: I have a better thing of the day More consumable by all of you.

200
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:51,650
Speaker 1: It's a record that has a gimmick a vinyl record a lot of vinyl records of gimmicks.

201
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,401
Speaker 0: That's old hat.

202
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:59,410
Speaker 1: actually I'd say a very small percentage of vinyl records have gimmicks other than the fact that in the modern era all vinyl records are gimmicks.

203
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:05,530
Speaker 0: No, but even in the vinyl record days like we had so so many of the records we had were gimmicks.

204
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,016
Speaker 0: There's one that came in the newspaper.

205
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,586
Speaker 0: There was an ad for something or there was the McDonald's one.

206
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:10,430
Speaker 1: I think that was me.

207
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was one of them where if it played the song a certain way you want a bunch of money.

208
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,950
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm like that There's the Monty Python one where there's a track in between the tracks a three track record three track.

209
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,849
Speaker 1: We got a copy of that later on somewhere, you know.

210
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,569
Speaker 0: There's the Beatles one where once it gets to the middle it does stuff.

211
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:29,090
Speaker 0: This is the one where you play it back you spin your turntable backwards and it does something different.

212
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, so any trick that could be pulled with a vinyl record was it has been pulled.

213
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:46,450
Speaker 1: So this is probably the only instance of the so-called gimmick actually having a very valid Specific use that is intrinsic to the purpose of a record which is for you to hear music.

214
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:57,403
Speaker 1: All right, so the record is called Orelob Okay, which is Bolero backwards as in Bolero Ravel's Bolero Mm-hmm.

215
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:07,410
Speaker 1: If you don't know the deal with Bolero is that it starts out real quiet and it gets louder and louder And louder at this constant pace throughout the entire song.

216
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:12,050
Speaker 0: So the outside of the record that spins faster can be better at being louder.

217
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:16,869
Speaker 1: So yes This record is a gimmick in that you put the needle in the beginning.

218
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:22,610
Speaker 1: actually I realize most people listening to geek nights are probably too young to actually have ever used a vinyl record.

219
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:24,582
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know normal on the records.

220
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:34,416
Speaker 1: You put a needle a Physical needle like a pointy needle out out out my finger on the outside of the record the large edge and the record Spins.

221
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:45,582
Speaker 0: and because you know about circles You know that when a disc is spinning the edge of the disc is going faster than the middle of the disc Even though the whole disc is spinning it whatever pi radians per second.

222
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:46,946
Speaker 1: now a record is recorded.

223
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:51,404
Speaker 1: taking that into account The rotation rate of the record is what's counted like 33 rpm.

224
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:58,713
Speaker 0: For example Yeah, the music that's on the edge of the record is further apart and the music that's in the middle of the record is closer Together.

225
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,630
Speaker 0: so the speed of the music is always the same.

226
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:07,871
Speaker 1: But anyway, most records you put the needle on the outside of the record and it slowly moves down the spiral toward the inside of the Record.

227
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:14,090
Speaker 1: till it's done this record you put the needle on the inside and it slowly moves to the outside.

228
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:21,080
Speaker 1: Now a lot of fancy record players couldn't play this record because fancy record players Assume that records are normal.

229
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I want to resist this right?

230
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,160
Speaker 0: So like records some record players I had early in life You just you just the needle moved all about.

231
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,369
Speaker 0: you could pick it up and move it wherever the hell you wanted and you It would just be controlled by the groove.

232
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:40,370
Speaker 1: Yeah our turntable in the hi-fi system actually had a little like Mechanized thing that would steady the rate like it would try to move the thing inward.

233
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,542
Speaker 0: but there is a yeah fancy record.

234
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:51,150
Speaker 0: players had all these features like Automatically picking up and resetting the needle with little motors being able to choose a track if I record like ridiculous shit, right?

235
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,830
Speaker 0: It's like pushing a button and having the needle would go to the start of the record on its own.

236
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,870
Speaker 1: Scott and I are compared to a lot of you - we.

237
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:07,213
Speaker 0: If your turntable was attempting to move the needle on of its own volition that would counteract the you know This record.

238
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,842
Speaker 0: you'd be to have a difficult time playing it.

239
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:15,790
Speaker 1: But anyway this video Explains in very good detail why this was actually not really a gimmick.

240
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:22,370
Speaker 1: But legit was useful for this specific song and possibly no other song on earth that would ever be on a record.

241
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:25,203
Speaker 0: But of course you could make the song better just by putting it on.

242
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:28,920
Speaker 0: I don't know a wav file MP3 or a CD.

243
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:47,974
Speaker 1: the only value The sole value of this trick is this assuming vinyl records are all you got makes it better and it would be possibly better than a cassette depending but actually probably not because the height of cassette technology was actually Really freaking good.

244
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:53,670
Speaker 0: all the all the masters of all the music that went on a lot of these vinyl records were on debt tapes actually.

245
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,240
Speaker 1: So eight tracks have a reputation for being pretty shitty.

246
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:57,742
Speaker 1: They are.

247
00:20:57,762 --> 00:21:04,789
Speaker 1: I had an eight-track player I actually we had a car with an eight-track player in it and we had an eight-track deck in the stereo rack.

248
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,021
Speaker 1: But eight tracks not that bad a quality.

249
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,168
Speaker 1: Usually it's just that the eight-track players were shitty.

250
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:13,964
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, that's my thing of the day.

251
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:14,427
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

252
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,630
Speaker 0: So this video was going around but I don't know how many people saw it.

253
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,386
Speaker 0: it's a pretty long video and the title of the video is a gay man's opinion about yaoi slash BL.

254
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,838
Speaker 1: now with English subs a 40 minutes lie saw this floating around.

255
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:28,143
Speaker 1: I actually queued it to watch.

256
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,930
Speaker 0: So literally it is exactly what it says.

257
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:36,442
Speaker 0: It's some gay dude from Japan is Japanese, dude And he knows a lot about yaoi and BL.

258
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,910
Speaker 0: like whatever you thought you knew about yaoi and bl.

259
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,125
Speaker 0: This guy knows more right and it's just his opinion.

260
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,130
Speaker 0: You might disagree.

261
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:45,470
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that I agree with everything in this video.

262
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,827
Speaker 0: I watched almost all of it, but it's way long so I couldn't finish.

263
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:49,330
Speaker 0: I had to leave.

264
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:57,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched like maybe 20 out of the 30 minutes or whatever, but it was very fascinating and enlightening.

265
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:14,850
Speaker 0: So if you are in the anime community, right and like you have, you know preconceived notions about yaoi and bl or even if you're a fan of yaoi and bl you think you know a lot or You know, you know a little bit like I do right but I've never you know gone into the hole.

266
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,583
Speaker 0: You just like know that that's a thing like oh really gone into the hole.

267
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,568
Speaker 1: That's where you're gonna use for this.

268
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:23,164
Speaker 0: Yes Okay, it's like I'm like for me before watching this video like I knew like.

269
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:24,770
Speaker 0: oh, I know what yaoi bl is.

270
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,998
Speaker 0: I know, you know, I know it's general deal.

271
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:31,658
Speaker 0: I never researched it, but I know it's like nope now I know way more.

272
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:39,828
Speaker 0: so this is Recommended viewing for all anime peoples to be you know enlightened and such All right.

273
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:47,543
Speaker 1: so in the meta moment the book club book is Emily Wilson's new translation of the Odyssey by Homa.

274
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:49,188
Speaker 1: Oh, it's pretty good.

275
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:52,058
Speaker 1: I'm actually About halfway through at this point.

276
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:52,640
Speaker 0: Mmm.

277
00:22:52,660 --> 00:23:10,049
Speaker 1: You're halfway through further than me because this translation Reads in a very natural way and I am able to very directly and naturally enjoy the story at face value Without being required to interpret what's happening to gain enjoyment from the actions in the story.

278
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:13,865
Speaker 1: So it's just a really fun story.

279
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:34,679
Speaker 1: reading it from this perspective And even though I know the broad strokes and I've read the Odyssey before in high school Reading it closely with a modern translation it's it's Until we do the book club show about it, but if you're gonna follow us on the book club Hopefully Scott will read it soon and we can do a show on it.

280
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:42,239
Speaker 0: other meta news very soon is PAX East 2018 a four-day packs five.

Speaker 0: We got a panel on Sunday at the worst possible time.

286
00:23:58,523 --> 00:23:59,810

287
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:04,007
Speaker 1: It is a bad time is a bad time, but it's not opposite the Omega thongs.

297
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,515

00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,618
Speaker 0: Let's stick to work.

301
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:36,426
Speaker 0: do what you got to do.

302
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,487
Speaker 0: All you people who are like can never go to a PAX in my whole life.

303
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:41,050
Speaker 0: Well, here you go.

304
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,593
Speaker 0: It's the set.

305
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:46,316
Speaker 0: It's maybe the biggest or second biggest bags And you can go to it real easy.

306
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:50,330
Speaker 0: is the biggest packs in terms of people maybe but it's the second biggest in terms of.

307
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:57,910
Speaker 0: They do not publish Official stats now, it may be the biggest in terms of people but it's definitely the second biggest in terms of industry presence.

308
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:01,145
Speaker 0: Yes, South and OS have a small industry presence.

309
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:10,096
Speaker 1: West and East have a large And unplugged has a vendor presence, but not so much of the real like wider industry presence Which is still pretty good.

310
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:12,650
Speaker 0: industry presents, but it's you know tabletop doesn't have video game money.

311
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,969
Speaker 1: There's definitely more focus on vending by the industry as opposed to expo in.

312
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:19,036
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's a packs coming.

313
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:23,330
Speaker 0: also the anime seasons about like gonna be over in like three weeks.

314
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,361
Speaker 0: So we're gonna judge anime by its cover for the spring season.

315
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:28,864
Speaker 0: Maybe after packs right before packs Yep.

316
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:42,570
Speaker 1: And if you're waiting for us to resume our antenna show on the day that we record the video for the next judge anime by Its cover we're also going to record the video for the episode 16. geek nice presents utenna Which is the episode where spoilers nanami?

317
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:51,386
Speaker 1: Literally turns into a cow like moo moo cow moo moo cow making milk move which then Inexplicably happens in the movie with zero context.

318
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:52,030
Speaker 0: That's right.

319
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:53,614
Speaker 1: My mom walked.

320
00:25:53,714 --> 00:26:02,040
Speaker 1: I literally was watching the utenna movie and my mom like came into the room just as that scene started and She watched it like just while she was doing her thing.

321
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,944
Speaker 0: She's like what the fuck.

322
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:07,588
Speaker 1: and then later that day She was like what the hell was that movie about.

323
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:07,629
Speaker 1: I?

324
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,479
Speaker 0: Watched the whole thing and I couldn't tell you.

325
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:11,828
Speaker 0: Yeah naked cars.

326
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:14,469
Speaker 0: That's all It's all I know is naked cat.

327
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,710
Speaker 1: There's that interview with Ika Hara where they're like.

328
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,959
Speaker 1: So what's different about utenna in the movie as opposed to the show?

329
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:27,889
Speaker 1: and he literally says well for one thing in the movie Utenna turns into a car and then he just stops talking.

330
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:34,750
Speaker 1: Anyway If yeah, if you've you've if you're an anime fan at all?

331
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:39,985
Speaker 1: You've seen the ephemera of pop team epic in your social media.

332
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,570
Speaker 0: It's the day you use social media.

333
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:51,136
Speaker 1: There's a tall anime moe blob with blue hair and a short anime moe blob with yellow hair and I Usually flipping you off.

334
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:54,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I saw them very very often around the internet.

335
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:57,961
Speaker 0: in many places I kept seeing these same two characters the tall one in the short.

336
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,090
Speaker 1: like my Anna Twitter was filled with this shit.

337
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,521
Speaker 0: I've seen them for a long time many many months.

338
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,048
Speaker 0: Perhaps even I don't know how long it's been around But I've been seen a lot.

339
00:27:05,672 --> 00:27:20,969
Speaker 0: I've been seeing those call the anime not along but I think it's based on a four coma which is a four panel comic Like as among Adia was a four panel comic right basically like, you know a penny arcade of Japan Only penny arcade of three panels usually anyway.

340
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:31,297
Speaker 0: So yeah, I mean I've been seeing this everywhere and this season during judge anime by its cover we saw Oh, this is now an anime for season one.

341
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,202
Speaker 0: I guess we'll have to check that out.

342
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:36,010
Speaker 0: And so I checked it out.

343
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:37,720
Speaker 0: What did we say when we judged it?

344
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:39,330
Speaker 1: So what I there was a chat.

345
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:45,258
Speaker 1: I'm not ready to get out now where Scott a while ago just a couple times asked me Did you watch any of it yet?

346
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:45,941
Speaker 1: Cuz I had.

347
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:47,527
Speaker 1: I kept saying I'll watch it.

348
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:48,029
Speaker 1: I'll watch it.

349
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:51,726
Speaker 1: So Scott having watched an episode one episode kept asking me.

350
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:52,510
Speaker 1: Have you seen it?

351
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,300
Speaker 1: And then I saw it now.

352
00:27:55,341 --> 00:28:00,156
Speaker 1: I know why he asked me that I I Really like it.

353
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:08,458
Speaker 1: Okay, but the caveat is It took me a while to understand The hell I was watching.

354
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:19,280
Speaker 1: this is there's a time where we would say like Oh, there's anime that someone who hasn't seen anime before could watch like cowboy bebop Mm-hmm, and then there's anime that really only makes sense.

355
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,241
Speaker 1: If you are deep in the anime bullshit like Excel saga Elf Princess rain Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo.

356
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:27,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are you know, this.

357
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:39,444
Speaker 0: this is a long and treasured Anime genre the completely insane wacky off-the-wall Parody crazy anime that is nonsensical and you know whatnot.

358
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:41,630
Speaker 0: and there are many of those that I enjoy.

359
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:51,481
Speaker 0: It is not a genre that I'm opposed to in fact, I find it quite humorous, but this instance of the genre left me Dumbfounded like I didn't like.

360
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,650
Speaker 1: I was dumbfounded.

361
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,097
Speaker 0: I felt like it's like usually.

362
00:28:55,238 --> 00:28:59,190
Speaker 0: I'm a person who knows anime things so I should be able to understand this.

363
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:01,390
Speaker 0: I enjoy things that are quite hellish.

364
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,040
Speaker 0: Right anime hellish and yet watching this.

365
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:10,255
Speaker 0: I didn't understand a fuck thing that was going on Other than like, okay.

366
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:14,589
Speaker 0: I see what you did there and then and then it was over and it's like what the.

367
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:20,266
Speaker 0: so People love this and I don't know if I can watch anymore because my life is short.

368
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:21,510
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch it all.

369
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:25,610
Speaker 1: Okay, so I watched a second episode and I watch half of a third episode.

370
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:27,290
Speaker 0: I'd only watched the first episode.

371
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:38,190
Speaker 1: So I figured out the D. I figured out what I liked about it because I spent when I was watching this The first 15 minutes or 12 minutes of the episodes the first half of episode one.

372
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,372
Speaker 0: but first it shows like this other anime right and I'm pretty.

373
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:48,630
Speaker 0: I could sort of guess like did I did crunchyroll mess up or are they starting with a joke by showing this?

374
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,690
Speaker 1: Other anime and being like ha ha ha that kind of thing has itself been a trope in anime.

375
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,929
Speaker 1: There's an episode of gassaraki where the opener is different and you're like, wait what?

376
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,095
Speaker 1: Did I watch the wrong show?

377
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:01,300
Speaker 1: Is this the wrong VHS tape?

378
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:02,747
Speaker 1: There's an episode of try gun.

379
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,676
Speaker 1: That's like wait Why are they all on a space station?

380
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:05,641
Speaker 1: What the fuck is this?

381
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:06,385
Speaker 1: is this?

382
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:07,470
Speaker 1: try again, right?

383
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:13,223
Speaker 0: So it's like at first you don't even know if you're watching pop teen epic And then of course you are right and I sort of like.

384
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,090
Speaker 0: I guessed it and then it was confirmed.

385
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:19,181
Speaker 0: But the thing is that weird parody anime that they showed at the start.

386
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:26,882
Speaker 0: the reason that it was so confusing was because it Wasn't even like a parody of a more generic anime.

387
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:27,745
Speaker 0: it literally was.

388
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:35,610
Speaker 0: they just made a generic anime But they literally made like a minute of generic anime not doing any weird jokes or anything crazy.

389
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:35,731
Speaker 1: Like.

390
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:37,526
Speaker 1: if you showed someone this they were.

391
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:42,730
Speaker 1: just assume They're those b-minus anime that everyone ignores like one of a dozen from every season, right?

392
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:50,830
Speaker 0: It's like you could have just found an anime that like failed to get finished Taken the first minute of it and slapped it in the first minute of this show without any changes whatsoever.

393
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:55,657
Speaker 0: And it's like I see what you did there, but it's not funny It just leaves me confused.

394
00:30:55,938 --> 00:31:02,002
Speaker 1: so watching this through the first half I laughed out loud a couple times, but then I'll mostly.

395
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:04,310
Speaker 1: I was just trying to figure out the fuck this what was going on.

396
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:10,910
Speaker 1: But then in the second half, I thought crunchyroll messed up and it was looping.

397
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:14,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do because they do it that they repeat the thing again.

398
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:17,514
Speaker 1: format is WarioWare style.

399
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:31,950
Speaker 1: there will be like six to seven second shorts Just one after another like it is so rapid-fire that if you're not paying attention You will miss it all and then they'll be closing credits halfway through the episode.

400
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:36,468
Speaker 1: then there will be the exact same set of stuff.

401
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:47,248
Speaker 1: skits again Mostly the same But something will be cooked slightly differently the second time through the second episode.

402
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:47,850
Speaker 0: do the same thing.

403
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,821
Speaker 1: Yes, really and as soon as I got that.

404
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:53,512
Speaker 1: so I literally was watching this and then I was like wait What the fuck.

405
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:58,270
Speaker 1: I started going back and forth between the first half and the second half to see if they were actually the same.

406
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:04,967
Speaker 1: I ended up having two C rolls open like watching the same bit side by side and then I got it.

407
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:16,450
Speaker 1: and When I when I watched the second half all the way through I Saw I remembered like oh that this is the joke that was happening and then it would be different in a way.

408
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:26,658
Speaker 1: That was really funny okay, and when I watched the second episode kind of having this gnosis of what the deal was I Laughed out loud several times.

409
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:39,390
Speaker 1: I find the show legitimately funny and more importantly I Can't necessarily place every reference to a specific show But I started picking out a lot more of what the parodies were.

410
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:40,392
Speaker 1: Like.

411
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:46,750
Speaker 1: one of them was straight-up like hey remember chrono trigger the end and then they did the same chrono trigger again.

412
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,618
Speaker 1: But then it was a different particularly like.

413
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:56,447
Speaker 1: here's an example of the kind of parody in this show There'll be a moment where the girls bump into each other and fall over because one's running with toasters some shit.

414
00:32:56,508 --> 00:33:05,394
Speaker 1: Yep In one of the instances the one girl drops a pendant that the that is on that it landed on the other girl And that's sort of like a trope.

415
00:33:05,414 --> 00:33:34,270
Speaker 1: that's happened with like some magical girl type fantasy shows when the same scene happens again There's no pendant and instead like the girls bump into each other and then you get this very particular scene That has occurred in a ton of anime over the years where someone is knocked down and you get and they look up and then You get this flash you get a close-up of their face looking up and then you get a close-up of the other character Looking down at them and smiling reaching out their hand.

416
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:42,789
Speaker 1: then it cuts to the wide shot of the two of them looking at each other and then that shot pans up and Accelerates into the sky and then you get the opening credits.

417
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:45,877
Speaker 1: That is the extent of the parody.

418
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:51,936
Speaker 1: that entire scene is itself the parody and then it moves on to a completely Different set of parody, right?

419
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:55,530
Speaker 0: So I already brought up Azumanga die, which is also based on for coma, right?

420
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,698
Speaker 0: And I was a manga that expands right?

421
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:02,010
Speaker 0: It's it's it's it's you know, it stretches the four coma out.

422
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:09,010
Speaker 0: What was originally just four panels and a gag will now be like a 30 second to one minute like, you know gag.

423
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:15,092
Speaker 0: we're like you actually animate the cat biting someone right whereas this is Compression.

424
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:21,090
Speaker 0: they take the the each comic and it's like boom It's on the screen for a few seconds and there's just tons of them.

425
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:30,809
Speaker 1: Everything is distilled to its like minimum viable parody compressed not you know Whereas the Azumanga die was decompressed so much like how Wario were?

426
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:45,688
Speaker 1: Was like six second games like these micro games that were themselves these like simulacra echoes of real games Like you appear as Zelda and our link in a Zelda game and literally it's walk up into the cave.

427
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:46,851
Speaker 1: You're done you win That's it.

428
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:47,636
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

429
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,188
Speaker 1: This is the anime equivalent of that.

430
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:55,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I still like say I just couldn't I just couldn't follow what the hell is going on.

431
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:02,680
Speaker 1: I gave up like as soon as it clicked I was laughing out loud and I find this show Utterly delightful.

432
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,210
Speaker 0: so something that really surprised me.

433
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,940
Speaker 0: It's like the most obvious thing can't be ignored about the show.

434
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,510
Speaker 0: is that the voices of the two characters changing?

435
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,623
Speaker 0: Well, not only they keep changing but it's like they're not girl.

436
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:14,546
Speaker 0: They look like girls.

437
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:15,730
Speaker 0: They're not girl voices.

438
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:17,370
Speaker 0: They're like, oh dude voices.

439
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,244
Speaker 0: I think the I think the voice actor for one of them is the same.

440
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:23,354
Speaker 0: voice actor is like the Japanese wash the stampede.

441
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:24,719
Speaker 1: it's way better than that.

442
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:28,450
Speaker 1: Okay, go to just go to anime news network and look at the voice cast.

443
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:35,627
Speaker 1: okay, so Different people voice either of those characters in every episode.

444
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:44,510
Speaker 1: forever Like this is literally so and so is PP me so and so is PP me PP PP PP PP PP PP PP PP ... there's one two three four, five.

445
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:46,857
Speaker 1: There's like 30 different voice actors so far.

446
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:55,827
Speaker 1: like this person was Popoco in episode 5b Mm-hmm, but then an episode 5a a different voice actor played that character.

447
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:59,197
Speaker 0: Yeah And it's that's definitely unique.

448
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,707
Speaker 0: I haven't seen that the animation style is different.

449
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,510
Speaker 1: Everything is different.

450
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,184
Speaker 0: It goes live action pattern does change like constantly.

451
00:36:06,284 --> 00:36:12,850
Speaker 1: Oh in episode 2 It's almost like this scrap princess level of like anime like that kind of fantasy anime.

452
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:26,410
Speaker 1: But it's like the storyboards except these two characters are animated and the conceit Is that those are the main characters and everyone else is like the barely drawn background character from an unfinished slayers episode.

453
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,510
Speaker 1: Like that kind of nonsense.

454
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:38,800
Speaker 0: So I'm glad that like this kind of anime is still getting made like the genre of in completely insane comedy Highly evolved and Niche form of that kind of.

455
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,430
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm glad it's still being made.

456
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,589
Speaker 0: It still exists right because it feels like it's been gone for a long time.

457
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:45,995
Speaker 0: But this particular one.

458
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:50,649
Speaker 0: I just don't know if I have the effort or the patience to like bother understanding it.

459
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,586
Speaker 0: I bet you know rim also likes crazy YouTube crap like I do like potato conditions or whatever.

460
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,650
Speaker 0: I don't understand that either.

461
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:58,177
Speaker 1: But one thing I got to say about this.

462
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:01,090
Speaker 1: it is very easy to dismiss it as cheap and weird.

463
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,053
Speaker 1: It is actually.

464
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:02,374
Speaker 0: it's not.

465
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,819
Speaker 0: it's not cheap and weird.

466
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,625
Speaker 1: It's for what it is.

467
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:06,849
Speaker 0: It is definitely not cheap.

468
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:10,276
Speaker 1: It is Extremely high production values.

469
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,963
Speaker 1: a lot of care is going into this.

470
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:20,746
Speaker 1: the people writing this show are Doing a lot of very difficult work to make the comedic beats and parodies.

471
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:21,890
Speaker 1: They're trying to convey.

472
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:26,543
Speaker 1: It's almost like worry aware loss edit the anime parody.

473
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:27,004
Speaker 0: Yes.

474
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,010
Speaker 0: I can completely recognize all that going on.

475
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,978
Speaker 0: I just can't with my brain just doesn't Like.

476
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,010
Speaker 0: it tries to go in my brain.

477
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:40,370
Speaker 1: That's clearly a parody of like the sele style enemies from like Evangelion.

478
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:44,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like when you're trying to type stuff into a mud and it's like I don't understand that command.

479
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:45,230
Speaker 0: That's my brain.

480
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:47,391
Speaker 1: Yep, it took me a while Like.

481
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:53,270
Speaker 1: it literally took me until halfway through the second episode and then suddenly it clicked and this shit was hilarious.

482
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,637
Speaker 0: I only watched one episode and then I was like, well, I'm not watching another one even though I still think my favorite Joke is the.

483
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:00,929
Speaker 1: are you okay joke?

484
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,958
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm where she's just punching the other girl.

485
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:04,842
Speaker 1: She's like punches.

486
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:05,746
Speaker 1: It's like are you okay?

487
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:09,649
Speaker 1: He punches her harder Are you okay, and then something happens after that?

488
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, that seems to be like that.

489
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:17,710
Speaker 1: the most running joke that there was like he just kept repeating Yeah, I guess I'm I'm look at steamed hams like that kind of shit.

490
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,901
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff that really steams my hams.

491
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:28,766
Speaker 1: when there's a when there's a joke that is Distilled to its most minimal form kind of like how I really enjoy loss at it like.

492
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:34,625
Speaker 1: I understand steamed hams Yeah, but take that and distill it further and further like the last.

493
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:36,050
Speaker 0: you're not supposed to drink ever clear.

494
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:37,990
Speaker 1: No, this is this is ever clear.

495
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,074
Speaker 1: You take the ever clear.

496
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:39,816
Speaker 1: get it.

497
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:43,448
Speaker 1: get the like the syringe of ever clear.

498
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:52,706
Speaker 1: kill yourself But then turn that into a 12 episode 23 minute long episode anime series.

499
00:38:52,786 --> 00:39:01,786
Speaker 0: I was very surprised I thought it was gonna be one of the short ones like the animate with the opener and closer or longer than the actual show The fact that the episode was actually 20-something minutes long.

500
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:02,650
Speaker 0: I was amazed at that.

501
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:12,209
Speaker 1: but the craft of taking the most minimum viable components of parody and then using those and from there making a Full show is just amazing to me.

502
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:21,530
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm a sort of afraid for the future like the people who are making Masterpieces of steamed hams now are gonna be like the animators and TV show creators of the future.

503
00:39:22,074 --> 00:39:24,029
Speaker 0: I is all the shows gonna be like this.

504
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:28,770
Speaker 1: Will there be a future version of a show like gig nights where some people are like?

505
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:38,335
Speaker 0: Yeah There's those like there used to be those animators like or show and then it goes to cuts again and then halfway through the show They're like one day again Only slightly different.

506
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:44,921
Speaker 1: I'm thinking people like us or maybe us 20 years from now will be like, yeah Remember those accessible parody shows like pop team epic.

507
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:46,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't understand the shit.

508
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:46,748
Speaker 1: They're making.

509
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:51,149
Speaker 1: now Watch one episode of this.

510
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:55,290
Speaker 0: Yes, you're not a no if you're an anime person.

511
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:58,890
Speaker 0: This is like essential watching because it's such a big deal.

512
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,700
Speaker 0: Apparently at least one episode got to see what the deal is.

513
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:07,730
Speaker 0: and then if you understand it because you have a young Brain or rim brain then keep watching it.

514
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:13,216
Speaker 0: And if you're an old man brain like Scott and you don't understand what the fuck you just saw Well, at least you saw.

515
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,489
Speaker 0: that was important and you don't need to keep watching.

516
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:19,551
Speaker 1: I don't think the thing I actually would need to know the most is Like.

517
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:24,070
Speaker 1: the thing that would solidify every thought I have about the show would be finding out.

518
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,525
Speaker 1: Suppose Neil Cisarega watched a few episodes of this.

519
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:28,008
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

520
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:32,703
Speaker 1: Would he get it and like it or would he be confused and annoyed by it?

521
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,355
Speaker 0: I don't know because I annoyed by it I'm just confused.

522
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:40,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I Like the show a lot.

523
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:45,352
Speaker 1: you like a lot yeah, but I like the show a Lot.

524
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:48,709
Speaker 1: All right, and I don't know what to do about that.

525
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:53,048
Speaker 0: It might be related also to like you like all that like Adult Swim stuff that understand either.

526
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:59,719
Speaker 0: true It could be say if it's not anyway, it's not like from a surface level It's not at all similar to that.

527
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,310
Speaker 0: and humor style, right?

528
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,644
Speaker 0: But it you know, it feels the same way where it's like.

529
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:06,090
Speaker 0: I can see that there is a joke here.

530
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:09,120
Speaker 1: There are things that I like that you don't like.

531
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:09,924
Speaker 1: that are just like.

532
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:22,022
Speaker 1: I like a different style of humor but this is a much more specific type of hyper distilled and then Every possible variation using the most minimum possible components.

533
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:24,810
Speaker 1: That is a particular genre of media.

534
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,355
Speaker 0: I don't think there's.

535
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:26,929
Speaker 0: what else is in that genre anything.

536
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:30,044
Speaker 1: Steamed hams is almost too long form for that.

537
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:30,929
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

538
00:41:31,753 --> 00:41:35,854
Speaker 0: This is really like a unique thing that the Which is.

539
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:39,927
Speaker 1: why would argue that Wario aware micro games themselves are that?

540
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:40,790
Speaker 0: yeah, probably.

541
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,056
Speaker 1: But the thing there's no other Wario.

542
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:45,923
Speaker 0: where anime that I'm aware loss edits are that?

543
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:47,266
Speaker 0: yes sort of.

544
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:56,899
Speaker 0: but I understand a loss at it Yeah but most of the time and the thing about a loss at it is when you see one and you don't realize it is one and Then you do realize it is one.

545
00:41:56,939 --> 00:42:02,485
Speaker 0: and then because it took you time to realize That's where its power lies if there's one you recognize immediately.

546
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:03,570
Speaker 0: It has no power.

547
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,173
Speaker 1: It's a full.

548
00:42:04,193 --> 00:42:04,837
Speaker 1: you know what that is.

549
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:07,250
Speaker 1: That is the fully evolved form of the Rick roll.

550
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:10,538
Speaker 1: You don't trick someone in looking at some with something.

551
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:14,330
Speaker 1: you get someone to look at something and wait for their moment of parapeteia.

552
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:15,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you.

553
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:16,250
