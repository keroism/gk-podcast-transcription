00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,133
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday June 24th 2014.

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,829
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek knives tonight.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,716

5
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:26,800
Speaker 0: let's do this.

6
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,037
Speaker 0: So there's been a problem between me and Scott for a number of years.

7
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:32,720
Speaker 0: what problem?

8
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,547
Speaker 1: So you make annoying noises.

9
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:38,080
Speaker 0: when we got here when we got home to do the show Scott was watching the biking anime.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,165
Speaker 0: We're hanging out doing our thing.

11
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:41,414
Speaker 0: Scott's really wondering what I'm about to bring up.

12
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:42,720
Speaker 0: and then what this conversation?

13
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:47,734
Speaker 0: And then I had a snack before the show as I want to know.

14
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,057
Speaker 1: I know you're talking about now.

15
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:57,979
Speaker 0: so Scott what is wrong with eating croutons or as I like to call them advanced crackers, would you?

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,132
Speaker 1: Take ketchup and just like fucking drink it.

17
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,180
Speaker 0: Well, that's a condiment and A crouton is a condiment.

18
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:10,320
Speaker 0: You do not shake croutons out of a dispenser on your table.

19
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:14,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, come in a bag or a container and you shake them onto salads.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,288
Speaker 1: You do not have you ever seen any restaurant in the world.

21
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,916
Speaker 1: just serve croutons to eat straight up.

22
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:20,337
Speaker 0: Yes.

23
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:24,609
Speaker 0: They're in the Buffet all the time the salad bar.

24
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:26,554
Speaker 1: They're meant to put on the south.

25
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:28,880
Speaker 0: Who are you to say what they're meant to be done?

26
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:30,246
Speaker 0: They're there?

27
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,160
Speaker 0: no next to other things.

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,440
Speaker 1: I'm just glad I don't have to come up with any more reasons not to do this because everyone listening already is on my side.

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,681
Speaker 1: So

30
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:47,171
Speaker 0: I ask all of you out there if you believe in anything that is good or holy and you enjoy actual food something to go go to your kitchen go find your finger croutons

31
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:47,833
Speaker 1: and just

32
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:53,932
Speaker 0: eat one like it's a cracker and Realize that there is nothing stopping you from doing that anytime you want.

33
00:01:54,554 --> 00:02:00,184
Speaker 1: Yeah your sense of self-worth Your Pride as a human being.

34
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:13,264
Speaker 0: so speaking of same pride that you would lose if you drank ketchup is the same pride you lose When you eat a crouton, so speaking of pride in being a human being it is the steam summer sale and something Something amazing happened.

35
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,271
Speaker 0: I no longer care about steam sales.

36
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:17,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have all these games.

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,719
Speaker 1: It's not video game season right now.

38
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,584
Speaker 1: There's no game.

39
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,970
Speaker 0: I'm playing a lot of video games.

40
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,420
Speaker 1: My problem is I'm playing basically no video games.

41
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not playing any board games either.

42
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:35,820
Speaker 1: There's nothing on the steam sale that I really want or urgently need to play right now, I mean that brothers game.

43
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,587
Speaker 1: Okay, it's some artsy thing.

44
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,880
Speaker 0: It's probably is a good interactive amusement and experience.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,121
Speaker 1: It looks like it looks like an entertaining software for three dollars doesn't look like a game, but that doesn't bother me I'll.

46
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:49,836
Speaker 0: so my trouble is not that I don't be on sale again.

47
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:50,720
Speaker 1: It's not going anywhere.

48
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:55,480
Speaker 0: My problem is again right now in any fashion that I do not want to buy these games.

49
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:01,780
Speaker 0: My problem is that four times so far this team's summer sale four.

50
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:06,620
Speaker 0: I saw a game and thought wow, I would definitely play that game for that price.

51
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:24,670
Speaker 0: I clicked on it with the intention of purchasing is purchasing it and Instead of taking me to the shopping cart It took me to a screen that said in green you already own name of game that you just clicked on play now And I in every case I would go what really?

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,400
Speaker 0: and I go to my library and sure enough there it is.

53
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,007
Speaker 0: It's even installed.

54
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,800
Speaker 1: I thought FTL the expansion you had to buy.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,893
Speaker 1: Nope, because I bought regular actually kick-started FTL zillion years ago.

56
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:36,996
Speaker 1: I have all the FTL.

57
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:38,180
Speaker 1: I didn't have to buy anything.

58
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,988
Speaker 1: I went to click on the FTL expansion thing.

59
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,013
Speaker 1: It's like you already have FTL.

60
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,580
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, alrighty then.

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've been playing a lot of FTL lately.

62
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,660
Speaker 1: I played zero FTL lately.

63
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:49,078
Speaker 0: I've had a lot of flying to do lately.

64
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,326
Speaker 0: Advanced mode makes that game.

65
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,700
Speaker 0: you could play that game for the next ten years and never get tired of it.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,213
Speaker 1: But I didn't even play more than I.

67
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,925
Speaker 0: you suck at FTL Not that I suck.

68
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,112
Speaker 1: I just have no interest in it's like I'm done.

69
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,400
Speaker 0: you beat it on like beginner mode.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, what interest do I have in playing it with a different ship or on a harder mode?

71
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,948
Speaker 0: None, the game is completely different in those modes.

72
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,653
Speaker 1: I have no interest in that.

73
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,920
Speaker 0: I don't understand why the game is engaging.

74
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,394
Speaker 1: I've already beaten it and seen the end.

75
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:18,339
Speaker 1: What more is there?

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you.

77
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:22,360
Speaker 0: so if you beat Mega Man 2 on baby mode, then you've beaten it a hundred percent.

78
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,416
Speaker 1: Mega Man 2 doesn't have baby mode.

79
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:24,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

80
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,804
Speaker 0: You're Japanese only?

81
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:28,867
Speaker 1: Of course.

82
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:35,199
Speaker 0: So if someone played Mega Man 2 on easy mode Then they're not in person.

83
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:39,635
Speaker 1: They say they've lost the same pride that they would lose if they ate a crouton or drank ketchup.

84
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,080
Speaker 0: Oh, I see how it is Exactly.

85
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,549
Speaker 0: Seriously, Scott's really bad at FTL.

86
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:45,494
Speaker 0: I've watched him play.

87
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,780
Speaker 0: It's not pretty to watch.

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,222
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

89
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,252
Speaker 1: you click you wait for your shit to recharge?

90
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:50,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, so how come you can't beat it on normal?

91
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,706
Speaker 0: I can beat it on normal almost every time I play Because I don't give a shit.

92
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:55,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

93
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,400
Speaker 1: Let's play some netrunner.

94
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,760
Speaker 0: So actually I should be playing some netrunners soon because I saw that some other friends of ours Conrad was playing some netrunner recently.

95
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,880
Speaker 1: Why is he not coming to play netrunner with us or at least at the NYU Game Center near him?

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,929
Speaker 0: I think he just learned how to play and seemed to really like it But why wasn't he listening to me telling to play like?

97
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,519
Speaker 0: it's something that appeared on the steam summer sale just now?

98
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,587
Speaker 0: that I think is interesting is Murdered soul suspect which is one of.

99
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,513
Speaker 1: I've never heard of this ever really.

100
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:23,155
Speaker 1: what is?

101
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,479
Speaker 0: it is one of two.

102
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,011
Speaker 0: You're a ghost detective games.

103
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,820
Speaker 1: What's the other ghost detective game?

104
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,208
Speaker 0: I don't remember but I kept confusing them.

105
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,319
Speaker 1: ghost trick, which is really good and is like DS game.

106
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,430
Speaker 0: No, these are both PC games.

107
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,899
Speaker 0: Okay, but this game uh.

108
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:47,424
Speaker 0: So the tagline on the game in all caps is the hardest murder to solve is your own Dun dun.

109
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,615
Speaker 0: dun which I think is objectively true.

110
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:50,499
Speaker 1: Do you know you're a ghost?

111
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:59,869
Speaker 0: You basically are surprised that there is an afterlife after you were murdered and you try to solve your murder But you're a ghost who walks around the real world.

112
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,180
Speaker 0: Yes, you walk around but time is still flowing.

113
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:02,743
Speaker 1: So you're not.

114
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:03,808
Speaker 1: you're still at you.

115
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,960
Speaker 1: basically you're dead and then up there you are looking at your corpse.

116
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:07,879
Speaker 1: Yep, and time keeps moving on.

117
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:14,818
Speaker 0: You basically go around like trying to figure out what happened figure out who murdered you and why.

118
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:15,700
Speaker 0: and there's this plot.

119
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:22,257
Speaker 0: It has the popular user-defined tags of spooky detective supernatural mystery.

120
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:34,900
Speaker 0: I was doing those, you know I saw the Square Enix panel about this at PAX because I was running that room at the time and I Might have related this anecdote to you earlier.

121
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,100
Speaker 0: But just to reiterate the first or second question that came out of the audience was oh, that's why you know about this.

122
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:48,927
Speaker 0: Yes One of the greatest questions anyone has ever asked at a panel at a game convention ever and the question was So is this a game?

123
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,100
Speaker 0: Could I like not solve my own murder?

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,186
Speaker 0: Could I fail to figure out who murdered me?

125
00:06:54,989 --> 00:07:04,119
Speaker 0: and the people on the panel didn't answer for a little while and then they're slow Halting answer basically was summarized - no you cannot fail to solve your murder.

126
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,566
Speaker 0: This is not a game.

127
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,891
Speaker 1: It's an entertainment software.

128
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,256
Speaker 0: Yes, or at best.

129
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,300
Speaker 0: It might be an ideal game.

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,230
Speaker 0: It might be a series of interesting decisions.

131
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,640
Speaker 0: Anyway that all lead to the same Game, it's basically monkey island.

132
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:27,893
Speaker 0: So it's interesting that this game already release date June 3rd 2014 so less than a month ago is 33% off.

133
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,480
Speaker 1: That's you know, I mean, that's not a big sale.

134
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,111
Speaker 1: It's still what 33 bucks.

135
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:37,380
Speaker 1: Yeah But this is one of those triple-a square Enix games the South Park game which I actually kind of want to play.

136
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,900
Speaker 1: I really want to play that discounted but it's still 40 bucks.

137
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:45,117
Speaker 0: So yeah, the thing is the reason I want to play the and it's also Ubisoft.

138
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:45,880
Speaker 1: fuck you Ubisoft.

139
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:50,040
Speaker 0: The only reason I want to play the South Park games because it's basically an episode of South Park.

140
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,160
Speaker 1: That's exactly the only reason I want to play it as well.

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,100
Speaker 1: It's been a South Park drought usually the South Park in the fall and then South Park in the spring.

142
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,719
Speaker 1: There was no spring South Park, you know how seasons work for there is no spring South Park this year.

143
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,177
Speaker 0: Well, you know how I knew the last season the South Park.

144
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:06,213
Speaker 1: my guys It only takes you 24 hours to make a goddamn episode.

145
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw crying some out.

146
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,552
Speaker 0: Why do I not get seven episodes a week?

147
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,739
Speaker 0: I mean you guys could clearly do it.

148
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,460
Speaker 0: Seriously, you know what if they did you brag about it?

149
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:17,180
Speaker 0: I imagine six episodes would come out and then nothing.

150
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:22,139
Speaker 0: Eventually, the police would be called they'd go to the studio and everyone would be actual crab people would emerge.

151
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:28,142
Speaker 0: Ooh The Metacritic score in this game is 62.

152
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,358
Speaker 0: As far as I'm concerned, I mean, I guess anything under a hundred means the game is garbage.

153
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,304
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't care about scores.

154
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:33,785
Speaker 0: Do I?

155
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,852
Speaker 0: but I just find out what that means.

156
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:52,310
Speaker 0: the point of all that is that In ex I'm somehow no longer excited about the steam summer sales because I already bought all the games I wanted to buy in the last steam sale and I appear to already own almost every game.

157
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,972
Speaker 0: That's under $8.

158
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,600
Speaker 1: I have a desire to go biking.

159
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,020
Speaker 1: I don't have a desire to play a video game.

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,542
Speaker 1: So if you try to sell me video games That's like trying to sell food to a guy who just finished dinner and dessert and second dessert Yep.

161
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:08,594
Speaker 0: Now maybe because even if it's free foie gras, it's like.

162
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,620
Speaker 1: well, I would really love free foie gras.

163
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,020
Speaker 1: That's really amazing quality two milkshakes and a really great price.

164
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,920
Speaker 1: But there is literally no way I could eat anything not even if it's a way far thing.

165
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,027
Speaker 0: But I never forget.

166
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:27,950
Speaker 0: I tried to buy games that I already own Four times so far.

167
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:28,553
Speaker 1: Yep.

168
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:32,835
Speaker 0: I mean and here's the worst thing It's not like I like bought the games and never installed them.

169
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:38,097
Speaker 0: two of them Not only had I installed but I had logged at least an hour or two in them.

170
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,846
Speaker 1: Okay, so Skyrim They were selling the complete Skyrim right?

171
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,933
Speaker 1: Somehow I got the incomplete Skyrim.

172
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,057
Speaker 1: I think someone bought it for me.

173
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:50,939
Speaker 1: Thank you I played it a whole bunch and it was pretty good, you know, just same as the oblivion which I enjoyed and beat.

174
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,110
Speaker 1: and You know, I played it.

175
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:54,797
Speaker 1: I got really far.

176
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,268
Speaker 1: I found a lot of towns and did a lot of stuff and did a bunch of quests and was going on my way to Fus Ro Don shit and whatever right.

177
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,638
Speaker 0: and then I tell me did you have Fus at least?

178
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,281
Speaker 1: Yeah I had.

179
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,569
Speaker 1: I think I had more than that.

180
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,294
Speaker 1: Did you have Ro?

181
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,842
Speaker 1: I might add the whole thing I don't remember.

182
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,328
Speaker 0: So you got down as well.

183
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:10,830
Speaker 1: I don't know.

184
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,095
Speaker 0: Did you find Sailor Jupiter?

185
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:13,200
Speaker 1: I killed a bunch of dragons.

186
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:19,008
Speaker 0: Dragons are really Sadly easy to kill in that game.

187
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, well not early on but yeah once you.

188
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,493
Speaker 0: yeah But like it's really disappointing when it's like, oh, there's a dragon I'll just run backwards shooting my arrows at it and then it'll.

189
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,260
Speaker 1: I never use arrows like a sissy.

190
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:33,179
Speaker 0: Oh, all right, then it'll inexplicably keep landing near me and let me hit it.

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, why doesn't the Reagan just constantly hover over me firing flame until I die?

192
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,511
Speaker 0: Why does it ever land?

193
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,860
Speaker 1: It is not wise anyway.

194
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:47,300
Speaker 1: So, you know, I had a bunch of good times for a few days and then I just stopped and I never loaded it again.

195
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:48,178
Speaker 1: It's still installed.

196
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:56,799
Speaker 1: so why would I pay to add all the DLC shit to it that I haven't even Thought I had any desire to turn on the regular one.

197
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:04,993
Speaker 0: The lesson I have learned is much more horrifying because when I bought fallout 3 I got Jip because I should have just waited for the ultimate edition.

198
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,660
Speaker 1: I didn't know there was gonna be ultimate shit.

199
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,733
Speaker 0: Yes, now I've learned every game like that will have an ultimate shit.

200
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,420
Speaker 0: That'll be way better than the original game.

201
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:14,620
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, I wouldn't buy Skyrim until it was the ultimate shit.

202
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,836
Speaker 1: I mean if I didn't have it at all, I probably would have bought it.

203
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:17,239
Speaker 1: right now.

204
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,199
Speaker 0: Fallout New Vegas is under seven dollars right now.

205
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:25,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have the ultimate of that and I played it for like five minutes not fallout 3 level of quality.

206
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,647
Speaker 0: Yeah It did the part.

207
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,355
Speaker 0: if you cared about the fighting tactical kind of stuff.

208
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,037
Speaker 0: It did that better.

209
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:47,756
Speaker 0: but Most of what I actually expect to like about Fallout games is either the emergent behavior that doesn't really happen anymore or Just walking around the crazy post-apocalyptic Landscape which needs to have a bunch of stuff not just a bunch of empty buildings.

210
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:48,460
Speaker 0: I can't walk into.

211
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, well follow new vegas is a desert.

212
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,940
Speaker 1: I know I didn't even get to vegas cuz it was so blue.

213
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:54,406
Speaker 0: I didn't even get to vegas.

214
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,936
Speaker 0: No, you didn't even beat the mothership on FTL.

215
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,199
Speaker 0: I Did in baby mode?

216
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:02,938
Speaker 1: That's I don't care what mode it is, yeah, really I don't care at all.

217
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:05,999
Speaker 0: Well, then I've beaten Megaman 2 a bunch of times.

218
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,980
Speaker 1: Are you telling me you can't beat Megaman 2 on non baby mode?

219
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,923
Speaker 1: Is that what you're telling me?

220
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,309
Speaker 0: You can't beat FTL on non baby.

221
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:13,057
Speaker 1: telling me eat croutons and drink ketchup.

222
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:22,857
Speaker 0: I Grutons, I tell you what you want ever race If you beat FTL on normal mode before I beat Megaman 2 on normal mode.

223
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:27,599
Speaker 0: I'll eat a hat Tiny chocolate my hat.

224
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,353
Speaker 0: So in other gaming news, I don't know if you have a gaming news.

225
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:33,036
Speaker 1: I do.

226
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:39,635
Speaker 0: okay The sports ball player bid another sports ball player and that's a controversy.

227
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,704
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, let's talk about this gaming news Just quickly, right?

228
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,780
Speaker 1: So there's a Sonic the Hedgehog 2 HD fan project.

229
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,931
Speaker 1: So some fans want to remake Sonic 2 the best Sonic you mean.

230
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,540
Speaker 0: some fans want to get sued in HD, right?

231
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:52,227
Speaker 1: So that's the news, right?

232
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,678
Speaker 1: So I would play this actually cuz I really like Sonic 2 more.

233
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,972
Speaker 1: It's the best of all the Sonic's the only good one.

234
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:57,757
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna be.

235
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,597
Speaker 1: yeah Some of the other ones are not bad, but yeah, but it's vastly superior to you.

236
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:02,382
Speaker 0: play Sonic 2.

237
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,900
Speaker 0: Most of them are not worth playing sure.

238
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,696
Speaker 1: So a direct HD remake where it's the exact same game only looks a lot better.

239
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:08,600
Speaker 1: That would be really good.

240
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,147
Speaker 1: It would be like bionic commander rearmed.

241
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,740
Speaker 0: I'll be all about except that was not a direct remake.

242
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,423
Speaker 0: That was a direct.

243
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,171
Speaker 0: that was like a spiritual remake.

244
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:19,740
Speaker 0: that actually changed a bunch of things for the better Right, but anyway, like a DuckTales game that had all the bullshit.

245
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:30,120
Speaker 1: This would be a good thing if fans made it but I've noticed in my long gaming life If you look around when fans try to do things like translation projects or hacks and mods.

246
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:34,475
Speaker 1: Gaming companies don't seem to care that mother Translations are still out there, right?

247
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,733
Speaker 1: You know Final Fantasy translations are out there game companies.

248
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:38,940
Speaker 1: Don't try to stop you if you do that.

249
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:45,020
Speaker 0: I got a C&D about a Final Fantasy 5 ROM translation I had hanging around back in the geocities days.

250
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:49,334
Speaker 1: But when you try to do this, remember the people trying to make Chrono Trigger 3d.

251
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:55,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get shut the fuck down But these people abandon this project, but now they are picking it back up.

252
00:13:56,283 --> 00:14:05,040
Speaker 1: start the clock to see how quickly it gets shut down, but Sega you you know, you're looking to not suck and make a Sonic game that people actually want to play.

253
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:09,940
Speaker 1: Why don't you just do this for the fans instead of having fans do it themselves?

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,467
Speaker 0: But you have to do it right.

255
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,920
Speaker 0: that DuckTales game looked like it was gonna be the greatest.

256
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:22,700
Speaker 0: It was gonna be bionic commander rearmed with ducks But instead it was just like like they were faithful to the wrong parts of the DuckTales game.

257
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:26,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of like how modern MOBAs are faithful to the wrong parts of Dota.

258
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:28,140
Speaker 1: That's why I actually you're right.

259
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:36,319
Speaker 1: It's it's weird because in that bionic commander rearmed you had people who a were clearly huge fans of bionic commando But B also had game development skills.

260
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:45,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see remember we you know We do a lot of pan need to get both things together good gaming knowledge and skills Plus also being a fan but not being a fan boy.

261
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,595
Speaker 0: I was looking at our you know, our list of panels and it's a rare.

262
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,980
Speaker 1: It's a rare conflagration.

263
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,269
Speaker 0: I was trying to figure out like what panel I want to do.

264
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:54,112
Speaker 0: it packs us.

265
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,260
Speaker 0: if you don't go like which one would I?

266
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,573
Speaker 0: Be happy to do on my own.

267
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,090
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And I think I'll do.

268
00:14:59,151 --> 00:14:59,960
Speaker 0: losing should be fun.

269
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,874
Speaker 0: But I remembered that we did that other panel years ago that we didn't get video of because we were in a hurry to get The Omega thon called egregiously unrealized potential.

270
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:14,029
Speaker 0: and in that panel We talked at length about bionic commander rearmed.

271
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,132
Speaker 0: and how remember?

272
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,440
Speaker 0: that game was not the main game.

273
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,300
Speaker 0: That was just a promotional game to promote the real bionic commandos.

274
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:29,854
Speaker 0: No one gave a fuck about that sold so poorly that bionic commando Rearmed got a sequel and the new bionic commando is dead.

275
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:30,477
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

276
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,770
Speaker 0: So that's a topic.

277
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:40,180
Speaker 0: being faithful to the right parts Yeah, anyway, if anyone has video of that egregiously unrealized potential panel, we did it a packs many years ago.

278
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:41,264
Speaker 0: Let me know.

279
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:45,560
Speaker 0: I would like to put some form of that on YouTube if I could anyway.

280
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,544
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the biting.

281
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,891
Speaker 0: So it's to me.

282
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,620
Speaker 0: It's not news that a soccer player bit another soccer player.

283
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,606
Speaker 0: That's just like ridiculous.

284
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:54,431
Speaker 1: See the thing there.

285
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:55,960
Speaker 1: It surprised me a little bit.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,352
Speaker 1: I mean things like this have happened before head butts and bites, right?

287
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:01,640
Speaker 1: Yep, but you know, they're not too common.

288
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:06,774
Speaker 1: It's that someone was like ow and pretending to be it, but they weren't pretending.

289
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,459
Speaker 1: they actually got injured by someone.

290
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:12,200
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a more shocking part of it.

291
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,432
Speaker 0: You see that HD zoomed in photo and there's a fucking bite mark there.

292
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,560
Speaker 1: Also some guy bet a bunch of money.

293
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:25,398
Speaker 1: There was a people were betting 175 to one odds that this guy would bite someone in the World Cup because he had bitten people twice before.

294
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:30,314
Speaker 0: that's what Amazes me this people made that bet and one I would have bet.

295
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,743
Speaker 0: I would have bet money on that if I knew I could Bet on that.

296
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:34,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you can in every other country.

297
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,857
Speaker 0: It's I mean Mike Tyson bit a guy.

298
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:38,970
Speaker 0: once This guy bit two people.

299
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,918
Speaker 1: we don't know who he bit outside the boxing ring.

300
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:52,480
Speaker 0: well This guy in the context of soccer Bit multiple people was punished for it and yet was allowed to continue playing.

301
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:56,898
Speaker 0: I imagine if a hockey player bit another hockey player, they would never play in the NHL again.

302
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:58,733
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a long time.

303
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:03,559
Speaker 0: You take your gloves off you punch each other then you both go sit in the box.

304
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:08,519
Speaker 0: If was someone bit I think there'd just be a lawsuit like criminal charges outside of the game.

305
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,560
Speaker 0: So soccer's weird and messed up and I just find this hilarious.

306
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:27,767
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day the most interesting thing you've seen in the last day I do but I forgot what it was.

307
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:28,450
Speaker 1: Really?

308
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,654
Speaker 0: Yes, really old man.

309
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,557
Speaker 1: Do your thing of the day.

310
00:17:30,597 --> 00:17:31,260
Speaker 0: Old man Scott.

311
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,768
Speaker 0: Yes, old man Scott forgot.

312
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,095
Speaker 1: I didn't keep the link open.

313
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:34,959
Speaker 1: I remembered what it was.

314
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,860
Speaker 1: So, you know our friends over at super art fight.

315
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:40,449
Speaker 0: There are some of the best people.

316
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,520
Speaker 0: super art fight is one of the best.

317
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,173
Speaker 1: Maybe you should come see them at Kinetic Con right in the final round.

318
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:57,826
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a mystery Art fighter and I don't know who it is And I really want to know if it were if I didn't know but the ideal art fighter if I could think of anyone in The world to get in there.

319
00:17:58,027 --> 00:17:59,011
Speaker 0: There's only two people.

320
00:17:59,031 --> 00:17:59,413
Speaker 0: Hmm.

321
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:06,162
Speaker 0: I would either want to get Banksy Oh my god, or I would want to get Mike Krahulik.

322
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:10,535
Speaker 0: I would also like to see Katie Cook could probably do a pretty good job.

323
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:10,977
Speaker 1: I don't know.

324
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:11,920
Speaker 1: She's really fast.

325
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:13,587
Speaker 0: I think she can be.

326
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,351
Speaker 1: she has art skills.

327
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,419
Speaker 0: She could definitely do it because based on her style I think she could pull it off.

328
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:20,952
Speaker 0: Like I think she could draw quick enough in the art fight style to make it happen.

329
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:21,534
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

330
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,360
Speaker 0: There's the undefeated Yuka Ota.

331
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

332
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:25,934
Speaker 1: Is she going to Kinetic Con?

333
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,143
Speaker 1: She didn't go last year I don't know.

334
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,400
Speaker 0: don't think she's on any of the panels I put together.

335
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,979
Speaker 1: Well Sergio Aragones would also is also one of my number one people to be in the art fight.

336
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:40,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know Banksy There are plenty of people who'd be amazing in art fight.

337
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,360
Speaker 0: actually Banksy would be a good guest of Kinetic Con.

338
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:44,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, good.

339
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:45,427
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

340
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:46,170
Speaker 0: You never know.

341
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,316
Speaker 0: That's the kind of weird thing.

342
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,119
Speaker 0: I'll go for it.

343
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,090
Speaker 1: Anyway, so super art fight is doing much more internetting.

344
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,395
Speaker 1: They got a podcast going on.

345
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,459
Speaker 1: They got all kinds of stuff, right?

346
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,592
Speaker 1: So then they have another thing on YouTube.

347
00:18:55,673 --> 00:19:07,809
Speaker 1: on their YouTube channel Super art stream and in super art stream number 10 Appears another artist who would be excellent at super art fighting Casey Green.

348
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,463
Speaker 0: Oh There are shoe set sir.

349
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:14,473
Speaker 1: So you should watch super art stream number 10.

350
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:15,877
Speaker 1: It only has 64 views.

351
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:16,318
Speaker 1: Seriously.

352
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:16,859
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

353
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:21,658
Speaker 1: That should be like, you know, it should say 301 plus right now because they can't count the views.

354
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:29,134
Speaker 0: Yeah guys my video of like Twilight Sparkle getting Kanye'd has more views than I mean.

355
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:39,612
Speaker 1: in the thumbnail for the stream Which I guess they did via Google Hangout There is a drawing he has done of a cross between the Goodyear blimp and a narwhal in our year.

356
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:44,632
Speaker 1: Nor your blimp and that's just the thumbnail.

357
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:46,740
Speaker 1: there's an hour and 14 minutes of this.

358
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:50,845
Speaker 0: In the meta moment.

359
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:53,460
Speaker 0: the book club book is I guess you do my thing of the day.

360
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,560
Speaker 1: Do you have a thing of the day or are you an old man?

361
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,928
Speaker 0: Remember Arnold farts and egg ate?

362
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,192
Speaker 1: too many crotons.

363
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,680
Speaker 1: crotons can only remember tons.

364
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:06,288
Speaker 1: You can only remember the 80s Things of the day.

365
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,147
Speaker 1: Thing of the two decades ago.

366
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,160
Speaker 0: three days ago is not a super cut in the traditional sense.

367
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,148
Speaker 0: This is one of those things.

368
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:22,809
Speaker 0: basically they took extended clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, which are great already and They've added farts but not in the way most people do.

369
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,580
Speaker 1: most people just add farts when someone's making a funny face.

370
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,066
Speaker 1: It looks like they would be farting but they're not actually farting.

371
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:38,628
Speaker 0: these are added to moments where there is the Combination of the face and the movement and the reaction of other people to something else That make them perfect.

372
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:48,736
Speaker 0: and the first one is Conan and he's sitting there and then he farts and then the other guy kind of looks him like up and then he says something to the effect of Have you ever felt wind like this?

373
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,438
Speaker 0: Like it's that level of craft.

374
00:20:54,081 --> 00:21:07,840
Speaker 0: The book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz the precursor to all the other post-apocalyptic fiction Sci-fi pretty much ever where everyone's trapped with the remaining human society is sealed in in some way.

375
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,744
Speaker 0: I read the whole thing.

376
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,910
Speaker 0: It's worth reading.

377
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,895
Speaker 1: I read like a few chapters.

378
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:11,699
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish it sooner.

379
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:23,077
Speaker 0: However, the only thing I will say is that it reads the way your typical like Sophomore junior year like the book you have to read for a class and do analysis of it.

380
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:29,916
Speaker 0: It's quite rambling and Having read more than Scott though Scott agrees with me from the beginning.

381
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:37,768
Speaker 0: I think You got to know a decent amount about both Jews and Catholicism or this book makes no fucking sense.

382
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:46,399
Speaker 0: Like this is some inside baseball on Judaism and Catholicism And it only gets more inside baseball as time goes on.

383
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:55,733
Speaker 0: you've also got to know a little bit about actual nuclear doctrine like nuclear war as It was portrayed in the 50s and 60s like the term counter value.

384
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,480
Speaker 0: You need to understand what that actually means.

385
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,787
Speaker 1: All right, any other meta things?

386
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:04,560
Speaker 1: you should go and find us all over the internet and all the places that we exist.

387
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:05,810
Speaker 0: Yes, we have uploaded.

388
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:13,200
Speaker 0: to highlight some of them We have uploaded two significant videos recently our lecture from PAX East this last this most recent year.

389
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:19,780
Speaker 0: Why no one will game with you a panel that to be perfectly honest might be a little too real to real.

390
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:27,042
Speaker 0: You might feel a little uncomfortable watching that one - we have another episode of geek knives presents shoujo kakame You Tena.

391
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:32,080
Speaker 1: we are analyzing every fucking episode almost done with the first third of the show.

392
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,356
Speaker 1: Yes, almost first arc get two arcs left.

393
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:36,844
Speaker 0: It's up It's a big.

394
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:39,620
Speaker 0: this episode is significantly longer than the actual long.

395
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,069
Speaker 1: Take us a year two years.

396
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,297
Speaker 0: Okay, so you bought a year to do.

397
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,282
Speaker 1: Will be done in 2016 2017.

398
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:55,300
Speaker 0: give or take Mm-hmm, and we are going to also Scott's uploaded videos of the most recent netrunner tournament in Boston the Cambridge regionals big time.

399
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm running know what the fuck but New York won.

400
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,493
Speaker 1: take that everywhere else.

401
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,518
Speaker 0: your Jersey made it past the finish line.

402
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:03,180
Speaker 1: exactly.

403
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,008
Speaker 1: Our Jersey made it over the line.

404
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:13,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact of the final 16 cut Like 25% were people wearing our Jersey damn straight.

405
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:20,123
Speaker 0: So and July 10th 11th 12th 13th That's right four days motherfuckers Connecticut.

406
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:21,627
Speaker 1: Oh who should have said something about that?

407
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:21,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

408
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:28,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, Connecticut is a one of the better conventions out there But it's an everything convention.

409
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,695
Speaker 0: We run the panels and workshops department.

410
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,160
Speaker 0: We've been doing this for many years.

411
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:37,355
Speaker 0: This con is off the fucking hook and you should be there and also we are doing a bunch of panels at it.

412
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:37,997
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

413
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:52,120
Speaker 0: So according to Merriam-webster sportsmanship quotes fair play Respect for opponents and polite behavior by someone who's competing in a sport or other competition.

414
00:23:52,682 --> 00:24:02,140
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm conduct as in fairness respect for one's opponent and graciousness in winning or losing becoming to one participating in a sports.

415
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:07,780
Speaker 0: He's a great player who's also admired for his sportsmanship.

416
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:13,454
Speaker 0: Rhymes with sportsmanship Airmen ship a thwart ship.

417
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:14,639
Speaker 1: What the fuck is that?

418
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:27,140
Speaker 0: Then that's the only positive thing that's come out of you reading that dictionary entry Being across the ship from side to side So a thwart ship with and longitudinal frame wide.

419
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:41,131
Speaker 0: So being across ships, I guess if I'm on the side of the ship the port side And I'm starboard then we are a thwart ship a thwart ship Thwart ship when I'm in the passenger seat here in the driver's seat.

420
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,575
Speaker 1: We were a thwart car.

421
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:45,637
Speaker 0: I Guess that's your word of the day.

422
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:55,520
Speaker 0: so yeah, we're thinking about sportsmanship because Frankly the guy biting the guy the guy biting the guy and then Scott's been attending tournaments of things recently.

423
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,286
Speaker 1: I have one that runner tournaments mostly.

424
00:24:57,326 --> 00:25:09,228
Speaker 0: but yes sportsmanship comes up very often at net runner tournaments and it's entirely distinct from separate issues like cheating Because the different we've done shows on cheating we have.

425
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:16,186
Speaker 0: the difference between sportsmanship and cheating is that sportsmanship is the unwritten Unspoken rules of the game.

426
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,493
Speaker 1: Well, it's not necessarily rules of the game.

427
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,857
Speaker 1: It's just rules.

428
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,748
Speaker 1: It's just like Conducting yourself within it.

429
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:24,615
Speaker 1: So it's like rules of society, right?

430
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:25,800
Speaker 1: There's nothing to do with the game.

431
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:40,092
Speaker 1: it's just when you are playing a game there are certain rules of society and Conduct that change and only apply while you are playing in a seriously competitive game or not seriously competitive game.

432
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:48,840
Speaker 0: for example in my day-to-day life if Scott crosses me in some way I can say fuck you you motherfucker and flip him off and that's totally acceptable.

433
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:59,180
Speaker 0: But if I did that at like a settlers tournament at PAX I would probably at least be frowned at if not booted from the tournament by the people running it.

434
00:25:59,902 --> 00:26:06,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if there's a bunch of pieces of wood sitting on a table and I scoop them all into a box nicely.

435
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,460
Speaker 1: That's perfectly acceptable behavior.

436
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:15,150
Speaker 1: But if in the were in the middle of a game and those are the pieces of the game and the game is not ended Yeah, that's cheating.

437
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:16,079
Speaker 0: Actually, that's not.

438
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:18,505
Speaker 1: Well, it's maybe.

439
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,949
Speaker 0: you made a whole bunch of illegal.

440
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,637
Speaker 0: You made like eight thousand illegal moves.

441
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:35,700
Speaker 1: I'm just saying There Is certain conduct right, you know For everyday life there are rules of conduct that are not necessarily laws or written rules or things that you must do.

442
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:41,899
Speaker 1: there are just you know societal things where if you do them people will really hate you and you'll be a jerk and an asshole.

443
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,880
Speaker 1: and During a game any kind of game more rules apply than usual or different rules apply compared to usual.

444
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,189
Speaker 0: There's another fine point there that sportsmanship stuff is very.

445
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:56,940
Speaker 0: there's usually no defined objective line.

446
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,200
Speaker 0: There's almost no way to objectively say this is the line between just being a dick and unsportsmanlike.

447
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:12,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look it's like you can't write a rule like no trash talk because a lot of trash talk is perfectly Okay, and it's very sportsmanlike.

448
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,410
Speaker 1: In fact, it would be unsportsmanlike to not trash talk at all in some cases.

449
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,786
Speaker 1: But though at the same time trash talk goes over the line when does it go over the line?

450
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:20,990
Speaker 1: that's completely subjective.

451
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:24,495
Speaker 0: Well, of course though then again There's the gray area between these two.

452
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:35,374
Speaker 0: where on the sportsmanlike conduct is an offense of which one can be Punished in some fashion or for which one can be punished in some fashion in some sports They're all in American football.

453
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:44,766
Speaker 0: if I spike the ball in an inappropriate manner and there's definitions of what isn't is not an inappropriate spike or Celebration I could get in trouble.

454
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:45,249
Speaker 1: three humps.

455
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:49,378
Speaker 0: Yeah Like there's some like you're there are.

456
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,044
Speaker 0: what are the exact rules about celebration?

457
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,255
Speaker 0: like you can celebrate in some okay So you can't.

458
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:57,297
Speaker 1: you cannot have a loud right not have a group Celebration right.

459
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:58,589
Speaker 1: you need to celebrate on your own.

460
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:05,252
Speaker 1: You cannot use a prop in the celebration and the ball counts a prop you cannot like taunt the other team Right.

461
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:09,610
Speaker 1: So like you can't like point at the guy like if you like push the guy over and ran in for a touchdown.

462
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:12,885
Speaker 1: But while you're celebrating you can't point and laugh at that guy.

463
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:15,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Those are just some of the rules.

464
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:25,656
Speaker 1: pretty much you celebrate on your own, you know You can do generic things like saying yeah, the Lambo leap is grandfathered in you know That's pretty much it.

465
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:28,069
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there's more details than that.

466
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,240
Speaker 0: But but is that that's almost like?

467
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:37,950
Speaker 0: like I said, this is this gray area where that's where a game has rules Describing what is and is not sportsmanlike.

468
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:43,990
Speaker 0: I don't think that actually counts as sportsmanship because it once the game has rules about it That's just the rules of the game.

469
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:54,270
Speaker 1: well in the netrunner tournament rules, right and I'm think the same goes for pretty much every You know game that has official tournament rules that you're gonna play in a game store, you know magic settlers, etc.

470
00:28:54,951 --> 00:29:00,890
Speaker 1: There's a rule that says the judge can you know punish you for unsportsmanlike behaviors, right?

471
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,720
Speaker 1: And it's that's really all it says.

472
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:11,543
Speaker 1: it's like one sentence and it's like yeah Someone's being unsportsmanlike the judge can kick them out or do whatever they got to do Which can be problematic if people have different definitions of acceptable behavior.

473
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:13,490
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's increasing.

474
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:17,570
Speaker 0: It's especially problematic at lower levels of professionalism.

475
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:21,008
Speaker 1: So yeah, what usually ends up happening is everyone has to be on their.

476
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:21,732
Speaker 1: you know Your best.

477
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:22,033
Speaker 1: you have to.

478
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:26,070
Speaker 1: you have to lean towards your better behavior because you don't know this judge.

479
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:35,366
Speaker 1: If you're just going to some random store in Cambridge, yeah, where the judges are actually great by the way of course it's interesting because We shouldn't necessarily like it.

480
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:39,770
Speaker 0: Ideally you shouldn't need to explain to people like yo dog.

481
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:44,330
Speaker 0: You shouldn't whip your dick out every time you score a point and netrunner.

482
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:47,890
Speaker 0: That would be a great celebration.

483
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:48,529
Speaker 1: Okay.

484
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,190
Speaker 1: So here is an example of something that actually actually happened recently, right?

485
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,730
Speaker 1: So and the team covenant is like a big-time store out in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

486
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:02,549
Speaker 1: Right and they do a lot of netrunner there as well as Game of Thrones and other fantasy flight games and they're.

487
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:05,442
Speaker 1: they have Big internet presence, you know in terms of like.

488
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:08,755
Speaker 1: they stream all their stuff on Twitch And all kinds of right.

489
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:10,262
Speaker 1: they make lots of videos on YouTube.

490
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:11,347
Speaker 1: They're really popular.

491
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:22,726
Speaker 1: So their netrunner regional tournament at their store was streaming live and I'm watching it and It gets to the elimination rounds and this dude comes and he has a lot of play mats.

492
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,314
Speaker 1: cuz he played in a lot of Tournaments.

493
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:28,089
Speaker 1: if I would have kept all the play mats from the tournaments I went to I'd have like five or six, right?

494
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,259
Speaker 1: But I only have one because I got rid of all the other ones.

495
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,149
Speaker 1: cuz what I want all these fucking play mats for?

496
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,050
Speaker 1: They're all so ugly, but he had a lot of play mats.

497
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:38,210
Speaker 1: So he sits down and he puts down the first play mat.

498
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:43,550
Speaker 1: He puts on another play mat directly on top of it and then another one and then another one.

499
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, he puts every play mat.

500
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,222
Speaker 1: He owns into like an inch thick stack.

501
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:48,065
Speaker 1: That's cool.

502
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,470
Speaker 1: And then he starts playing, right?

503
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,716
Speaker 1: So everyone in the stream is like death to Matt, man Fuck you, right?

504
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,924
Speaker 1: Cuz you it's kind of being an asshole move.

505
00:30:56,985 --> 00:31:00,625
Speaker 1: now unbeknownst to us That was like an inside joke for those people like.

506
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:01,309
Speaker 1: they knew the deal.

507
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:05,001
Speaker 1: But to us, you know spectators not knowing them.

508
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,110
Speaker 1: that looked like unsportsmanlike conduct to us.

509
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:12,235
Speaker 1: But he said as soon as he sat down before he did it We heard him say it on the stream.

510
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:17,416
Speaker 1: I asked the judges and they said this isn't unsportsmanlike conduct It's just being a douchebag.

511
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:21,527
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna do it and he starts landing up the play mats right.

512
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:26,823
Speaker 1: So there that's the kind of example of something that actually happened in real life.

513
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,010
Speaker 0: So there's you've never judge yourself.

514
00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:31,645
Speaker 0: I think that's perfectly acceptable.

515
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:32,610
Speaker 1: I agree with the judge.

516
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:36,470
Speaker 1: That is not unsportsmanlike conduct, but it is douchebag move.

517
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:42,297
Speaker 1: I would not do that move and I would and I would look down upon the person who did that move and That guy lost.

518
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,710
Speaker 1: he got what he deserved.

519
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:53,610
Speaker 0: so in some high school sports, especially in the more acted like the not like The academic sports like the quiz bowls and the signs Olympiads all the game that you play now.

520
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:57,967
Speaker 0: I saw this in some of the non basically non football sports as well.

521
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:03,410
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It was you could basically get in trouble if you beat the other team too badly.

522
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:07,489
Speaker 1: High school level that I see that discussion a lot on.

523
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:17,757
Speaker 1: Like sport like, you know real sports like TV and shit like sports commentators Like if some high school team beats another high school team in basketball like a hundred to two They'll be like what happened here.

524
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,143
Speaker 1: This is wrong, right.

525
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:28,521
Speaker 1: or even in pro sports It's like, you know, if a football team is like winning by 20 and they just keep trying to score touchdowns They'll be like, oh they're running up the score as bullshit.

526
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,064
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

527
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:40,810
Speaker 1: Yep, and You know, I mean for the high school situation or the kids situation I think the problem was a who even scheduled this game between really good team and really out.

528
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:48,315
Speaker 0: Well, usually it's just because one town just one year is a bunch of really Do about that be.

529
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,322
Speaker 1: why didn't they just forfeit or whatever, right?

530
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,950
Speaker 1: Why did they make let that game go on right?

531
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:59,570
Speaker 1: It's like, you know that that's shouldn't happen but in pro sports, it's like, okay, this is an NFL football team.

532
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:01,677
Speaker 1: The score is gonna be with the score is gonna be.

533
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:08,230
Speaker 0: I think college applies in the same way like watching Newman lose the game 24 goals to nothing in hockey.

534
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:13,506
Speaker 0: Yeah is one of those wonderful things you can see in the world and World Cup which is you know topical.

535
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:19,684
Speaker 1: right in the group Rounds at least they actively reward you for running up the score because the score differential matters.

536
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,690
Speaker 1: So you better run up this car.

537
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,315
Speaker 1: Otherwise, what are you doing?

538
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:23,677
Speaker 0: Yep.

539
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:24,442
Speaker 0: Well, I guess there this is.

540
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:25,890
Speaker 0: there's actually a pretty clear way to say this.

541
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:31,630
Speaker 0: What is the intent of the match in this case for little kids and like elementary schools?

542
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,468
Speaker 0: The intent is for a bunch of kids to have fun and play the game.

543
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:36,915
Speaker 1: the actual You know The intent is not for the kids to have fun.

544
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:41,270
Speaker 1: The intent is for the parents to have fun taking photos of the kids going on.

545
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:49,196
Speaker 0: Well, I think the difference is is it between and they feel like they're good parents between elementary schools Or elementary school teams?

546
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,125
Speaker 0: or is it the little league that's separate from the school.

547
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,256
Speaker 0: Yes for the little league Yeah, that's all.

548
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:58,850
Speaker 0: that's mostly for the parents But for the schools, it's just part of the educational process.

549
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:12,330
Speaker 0: but I feel like in almost all cases it is never really fair to Punish teams for that kind of behavior because that's kind of the behavior I would expect someone to put up against me.

550
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:21,779
Speaker 0: Like I'd almost feel worse if someone could trivially score against me and after they beat me by a whole much just Stopped like just obviously stop trying.

551
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,924
Speaker 1: Well, that's almost that.

552
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,370
Speaker 1: it depends on how they do it.

553
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:33,030
Speaker 1: Right, like if you're playing basketball Someone who just gets a basket right runs to the other end of the court steals the ball scores a basket and repeats, right?

554
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,230
Speaker 1: That's really frustrating.

555
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:40,559
Speaker 1: But if you imagine if the guy has the ball and he just he doesn't shoot and score he just keeps it away Just keeps it away from you.

556
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:47,603
Speaker 1: You can't get it from just keeps it away And just running out the clock keeping it away keeping it away And then when the clock runs out, he like throws it out of bounds.

557
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:52,049
Speaker 1: you go get it He steals it and then keeps it away until the shot clock runs out again.

558
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:54,639
Speaker 0: Is that more or less sportsman-like than just shooting it?

559
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,350
Speaker 1: It depends on the manner in which he keeps it away, right?

560
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:03,346
Speaker 0: But now are you obligated to fake like you're trying but fail for the entire rest of a one-sided match?

561
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:06,321
Speaker 1: I Think you know, this is why in Little League.

562
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:07,186
Speaker 1: They have the mercy rule.

563
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:18,745
Speaker 0: Yep So it mostly comes down to the organizers of an event deciding what the goal of that event is and Probably what the marketing around that event will be like.

564
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:32,090
Speaker 0: they don't want you know A lot of online type games and especially like the PC competitive gaming circuits and the fighting game competitive circuits They have some image problems with people who aren't inside their little communities.

565
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,154
Speaker 1: Well, look at hearthstone.

566
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:38,870
Speaker 1: hearthstone for all its problems of you know money right and winning and collectible shit.

567
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:40,430
Speaker 1: They solved all these problems.

568
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:53,967
Speaker 1: You just can't communicate with the person other than like these like six or eight built-in things You can say which are like well played threatened Yeah, so already every time the other player fucks up well played.

569
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:56,382
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, but that's all you can say.

570
00:35:56,402 --> 00:36:00,010
Speaker 1: you can only use those pre-built built pre-built in messages.

571
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,828
Speaker 0: Would you consider it unspoken like if I sent that message after every move the other player made for the entire match?

572
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:05,893
Speaker 1: if you do That they can.

573
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:06,537
Speaker 1: there's a button.

574
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,850
Speaker 1: they can just mute and they see nothing that you say.

575
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:10,817
Speaker 1: You can push those buttons as much as you want.

576
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:11,761
Speaker 1: They'll never see the message.

577
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, do I know they muted me?

578
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:18,804
Speaker 1: No So pretty much it's like unsportsmanlike.

579
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,170
Speaker 1: conduct can't happen.

580
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,294
Speaker 1: The only thing you can do this.

581
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:30,460
Speaker 1: unsportsmanlike is basically like if you have the match in hand Like you can whiz win anytime you want like this turn you could just win Instead of just winning.

582
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:32,453
Speaker 1: you just drag it out Like you.

583
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:36,390
Speaker 1: just let him go for another turn right and still let them try to do something.

584
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:40,810
Speaker 0: I do that pretty much all the time when I'm playing neuroshima hacks when I'm open.

585
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:45,066
Speaker 1: That's like the only thing that you can do in in Hearthstone.

586
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:46,010
Speaker 1: That's unsportsmanlike.

587
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:52,750
Speaker 1: So what about like and if you're against a serious opponent who is actually competitive with you, you can't afford to do that.

588
00:36:53,493 --> 00:37:08,537
Speaker 0: So our friend Chie recalled in Dominion her primary strategy Seemed to be to come up with a combo that would both win the game And cause some sort of ridiculous near infinite loop to occur Just to rub it in.

589
00:37:08,858 --> 00:37:09,079
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

590
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,463
Speaker 0: Is that unsportsmanlike?

591
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:12,510
Speaker 1: I mean, that's how you play Dominion.

592
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,789
Speaker 1: It's optimal play, right?

593
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,390
Speaker 1: But I mean, let's say is you know, is it unsportsmanlike to just be better than your opponent, right?

594
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:34,210
Speaker 1: so let's say you know, it's like you're Michael Jordan and you get into a basketball game and Against some other team and they're just not Michael Jordan and you win Easily, yep without much effort.

595
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,279
Speaker 0: Was that a failure of matchmaking failure of the rules of the game?

596
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,730
Speaker 1: if me and rim play by the commando if we play nidhogg Is that is it just unsportsmanlike for that for us to play in the first place?

597
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean is rim just supposed to like not commando.

598
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:52,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you when we play a street fighter You're like fine only like jabs.

599
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:56,856
Speaker 0: I will use Jab only like jab only.

600
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,340
Speaker 0: just you're just in the corners.

601
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,466
Speaker 1: I'm handicapping myself and then still winning.

602
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:01,710
Speaker 1: Is that unsportsmanlike?

603
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,390
Speaker 1: Insult you or is that balancing?

604
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:11,530
Speaker 0: I remember I finally beat you when you were like fine only jabs and I will never jump and then I beat you barely.

605
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:30,530
Speaker 0: Really what it comes down to in that front is if you're playing a game with someone where there is no Obvious and easy way to deal with your extreme skill disparity You just shouldn't play games with that type of person or that person or that game.

606
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:34,530
Speaker 0: Yes, like for example dance dance revolution handles this really well.

607
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,850
Speaker 0: You can play maniac mode right next to someone playing beginner mode and it doesn't matter doesn't do anything.

608
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:45,085
Speaker 0: In fact, they feel like they're helping because if you start to fail they keep you alive.

609
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,730
Speaker 1: They keep they keep your quarter alive.

610
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,008
Speaker 1: Yes, you don't lose your money.

611
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:50,444
Speaker 0: So it's partly an aspect of game design.

612
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:57,550
Speaker 0: if you're designing a game You have to think a lot about what unsportsmanlike behaviors does the game allow and encourage?

613
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:12,677
Speaker 0: And do you care mm-hmm I mean counter-strike if you have a server and you turn on all talk That is just ripe for the lots of unsportsmanlike contacts But at the same time with the right crowd.

614
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:17,470
Speaker 0: if that's your goal like these sort of semi casual games that can be super fun.

615
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:21,299
Speaker 1: So in terms of recommendations as a game player, right?

616
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:25,570
Speaker 1: I recommend that you be sportsmanlike and not be a dickhead.

617
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,279
Speaker 0: What is the definition of sportsmanship then?

618
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:29,343
Speaker 0: are we you just have that?

619
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,246
Speaker 1: you just have to?

620
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:35,090
Speaker 1: if you're not a dick Then you have good judgment already and you know, yep, right.

621
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:42,022
Speaker 1: so just use the good judgment that you have because a lot of people have good judgment and aren't dicks and Intentionally decide not to obey their better judgment.

622
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:43,910
Speaker 1: true become and do dickish things.

623
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,615
Speaker 0: But then there's that guy is the people who don't have good judgment But there's also the people.

624
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:51,870
Speaker 1: there's no way to just tell them what good judgment is because it's subjective.

625
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:55,570
Speaker 1: You have to just know yep, you have to be a socially aware individual.

626
00:39:56,711 --> 00:40:00,004
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much all it comes down to at least in everything but professional sports.

627
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:03,557
Speaker 0: and like we said in professional sports Oh, you can start by not biting your opponent.

628
00:40:03,577 --> 00:40:04,240
Speaker 1: That's a good start.

629
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're not sure about what to do Start by not biting.

630
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,570
Speaker 0: Oh, you know don't bite Don't tell them to go fuck themselves.

631
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,977
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that depends right?

632
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:16,919
Speaker 1: It's like.

633
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,470
Speaker 1: it's like if I lose to someone I can be like, oh go fuck yourself.

634
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:22,138
Speaker 1: There's the thing if you're.

635
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:25,416
Speaker 1: but then I could be like hey Maybe you should go fuck yourself.

636
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:28,328
Speaker 1: And if I say in a funny way, that could be totally.

637
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:33,045
Speaker 0: All right It can be but if you're a person who doesn't already know if it can be if it can be.

638
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,450
Speaker 1: All right, don't do it.

639
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,681
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rule is unless yeah, you know, you can get away with it.

640
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,310
Speaker 1: Don't do it if there's any uncertainty whatsoever.

641
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,730
Speaker 1: Don't say or do whatever you were thinking or not or thinking about doing.

642
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:52,724
Speaker 1: Opting to just not say or not do something Well is always safer than doing something unless it's saying good game.

643
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:53,587
Speaker 1: You could say good game.

644
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,550
Speaker 1: You can't get hurt doing that.

645
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:57,076
Speaker 0: So here's a separate related question.

646
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:57,357
Speaker 1: All right.

647
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:58,560
Speaker 1: Thanks for playing.

648
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,230
Speaker 0: or you know, this was relevant in like quiz bowl.

649
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,009
Speaker 0: It's relevant in a lot of video games.

650
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:04,919
Speaker 0: Good luck.

651
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:05,970
Speaker 0: Good luck games.

652
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:07,995
Speaker 1: So well played.

653
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:32,247
Speaker 0: what about situations where there are things in the context of a game that are not in any sense either in the rules of the game or the rules of the tournament structure or the rules of the community like the written rules of the community organization, they're in no way against the rules, but they are part of the widely accepted unwritten social rules of the game.

654
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:35,350
Speaker 1: like You want to talk about the bowing in Star Wars?

655
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:42,210
Speaker 0: Is that you want to talk about the bowing in Star Wars or the things that would be considered cheating?

656
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:47,870
Speaker 0: Except that they're not actually breaking any rules like observing other teams and taking notes.

657
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:50,374
Speaker 0: That's what.

658
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:52,290
Speaker 0: if there's some game we'll do that all the time.

659
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:58,710
Speaker 0: Yes, and there are some games where the community greatly frowns upon that but it's hard to have rules against it.

660
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,345
Speaker 1: They don't have specific rules in that run of the specific rule.

661
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:01,948
Speaker 1: No scouting.

662
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:03,434
Speaker 0: Yep What's the definition of scouting?

663
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:08,210
Speaker 1: if the tournament judge thinks that you're going around looking at other people playing to figure out what's in?

664
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,386
Speaker 1: Their deck so that when you play them, you know what they got Then they can just kick you out.

665
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:14,596
Speaker 0: Yeah So is.

666
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:23,670
Speaker 0: would it be unethical to have a friend go to the place where you know The people are gonna be in the tournament in the weeks before the tournament play and practice on their decks?

667
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:25,499
Speaker 1: You can't you?

668
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,228
Speaker 1: only time you can't scout is during the tournament.

669
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:31,389
Speaker 0: Yep So would it be considered unsportsmanlike for you?

670
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:42,610
Speaker 0: just hypothetical to have me go to Oklahoma or whatever for a month and Join the netrunner community there and hang out and play with these people and figure out what decks they're gonna use in the tournament?

671
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:43,508
Speaker 0: They give you all that info.

672
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,935
Speaker 1: People basically know whatever.

673
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:46,777
Speaker 1: it doesn't really matter.

674
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:49,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying it so there's a no way unsportsmanlike.

675
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,148
Speaker 1: No, not really.

676
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,234
Speaker 0: All right I'm just curious.

677
00:42:52,776 --> 00:42:57,575
Speaker 1: some I mean there might be a scandal if some No one no one cares.

678
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:00,463
Speaker 1: Well, the other publishes their friggin decks on the internet.

679
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:04,493
Speaker 0: is where we joined those Star Wars Servers those

680
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:05,536
Speaker 1: Jedi Knight -

681
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:06,901
Speaker 0: we played a lot of that

682
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:15,246
Speaker 1: played that game when it was brand new because oh my god It was pretty much quake 3 mod But everything was Star Wars and it was FPS but also lightsaber for the lightsaber

683
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:16,370
Speaker 0: combat was actually pretty fun.

684
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,724
Speaker 1: yeah, so you play lightsaber duels against random people on the internet and people had this thing where.

685
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:30,789
Speaker 1: but when the duel started they would You make their characters bow in game like crouch and uncrouch or lean look at the ground and then look forward again.

686
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,007
Speaker 0: Whenever someone did that one I would force lighten them immediately which they always said.

687
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:38,629
Speaker 0: no force lightning But I do it anyway And then I just rush in and fucking cut them.

688
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:47,628
Speaker 1: I would just immediately push these when as soon as they started to bow I would time it and use the strongest Powerful lightsaber attack that was really slow and his suit at a time.

689
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,807
Speaker 1: It's such that when their head was down it hit and then decapitated.

690
00:43:50,847 --> 00:43:51,310
Speaker 1: them is over.

691
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:56,210
Speaker 0: I would usually also as soon as the lightsaber duel started back up pull out my blaster and start shooting them.

692
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:57,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's also a good move.

693
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,450
Speaker 0: I got kicked from a lot of servers.

694
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, people would kick because it's their server.

695
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:11,419
Speaker 0: they have a right to kick you if they want but But eventually you find the server where the mod isn't there and then you'd go nuts because that is in no way part of the Rules of the game only the rules of the community.

696
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:11,801
Speaker 1: Yep.

697
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:13,450
Speaker 0: Were we being unsportsmanlike?

698
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,314
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

699
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:19,045
Speaker 0: We were violating all the rules of the community to an extreme degree.

700
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:21,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Don't feel bad about that.

701
00:44:21,722 --> 00:44:22,310
Speaker 1: I would do it again.

702
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:25,541
Speaker 0: I in fact not only do not feel bad about I'm kind of proud of it.

703
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:27,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would do it the same way again.

704
00:44:30,154 --> 00:44:31,810
Speaker 0: I remember when one guy got so mad at me.

705
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,156
Speaker 0: He's like for he said no force lightning.

706
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:35,679
Speaker 0: that he told me and I quote.

707
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,123
Speaker 0: that's unethical.

708
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,087
Speaker 1: Do you snake in Mario Kart?

709
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,896
Speaker 0: I Was the champion of snakes?

710
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:43,180
Speaker 1: Okay, that is the same thing.

711
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:44,926
Speaker 0: I have the scars to prove it.

712
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:47,169
Speaker 1: Okay, then We're done here.

713
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:59,045
Speaker 0: But I remember when that guy said that I said and I quote But I'm on the dark side and I proceeded to follow him around the server for doing nothing But force lightning him to death until he eventually quit.

714
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:03,483
Speaker 0: nice roleplay Yeah, I wasn't griefing I was role-playing mm-hmm.

715
00:45:03,684 --> 00:45:04,770
Speaker 0: I was I was I was dark Sith.

716
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:05,331
