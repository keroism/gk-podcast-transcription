Speaker 1: I Don't think you guys understand how excited we are about the term flouche.

7
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:37,595
Speaker 0: Yes, only a panda would know There are listeners are not pandas yet.

8
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:44,458
Speaker 1: Yep So, yeah, we played pan Dante and it was pretty much the best it was.

9
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:49,434
Speaker 0: so flouche Let's wait until the main bit to actually talk about the main bit one of the main bit to talk about the flouche.

10
00:00:49,835 --> 00:00:50,196
Speaker 0: Yes.

11
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:52,483
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

12
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:56,500
Speaker 1: So, uh in the news, you know, you're jumping straight to news there.

13
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:57,463
Speaker 1: What do you got?

14
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:58,929
Speaker 1: some other bid you want to talk about?

15
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,575
Speaker 1: No, no nothing at all.

16
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:00,957
Speaker 1: No.

17
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:01,719
Speaker 1: All right.

18
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,693
Speaker 1: Oh, though our live stream has already gone to bad status.

19
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:06,616
Speaker 0: That's not my fault.

20
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:07,540
Speaker 0: You suck at technology.

21
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,069
Speaker 1: Actually, it looks like the Elgato software is fucking something up.

22
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:13,180
Speaker 0: I've been using x-split which it costs money, but whatever.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the Elgato hardware But the software is just bought and it just doesn't work that way.

24
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,480
Speaker 0: only thing the Elgato software does that is good.

25
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:23,032
Speaker 0: That other software does not do is auto ducking.

26
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:24,780
Speaker 0: Nothing else does the auto ducking.

27
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can do the auto ducking here with the onyx and everything.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,280
Speaker 0: Well, yeah and your heart but most people do not have some sort of auto ducking hardware.

29
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:36,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Elgato doing it is you know, the Elgato software doing it is great.

30
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:40,376
Speaker 0: Normally for other stuff you need like OBS there was like a weird shady plug-in that caused money.

31
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:44,193
Speaker 1: though the Elgato You know, I guess it's relevant talking about game streaming.

32
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:52,500
Speaker 1: the trouble with the Elgato hardware too Is that it'll usually between it and its software have a semi non-deterministic or broken delay?

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,270
Speaker 1: Between your voice in the game.

34
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,740
Speaker 0: You have to push the buttons in the right order.

35
00:01:57,982 --> 00:01:58,906
Speaker 0: They might have fixed that bug.

36
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:02,320
Speaker 1: I don't think they did because I was testing and I still saw a lot of weird issues.

37
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:04,599
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's now talk about news.

38
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:09,753
Speaker 0: The biggest news in gaming yup on October 3rd, and right now we're recording this.

39
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,419
Speaker 0: my calendar says September 30th.

40
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,529
Speaker 0: for you It's probably October 1st.

41
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:24,315
Speaker 0: They're going to release for the 3ds Super Smash Bros The most important game in all of video gaming a new release.

42
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:30,474
Speaker 0: Hopefully not garbage For the first time ever on a portable system.

43
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,477
Speaker 0: Not bad.

44
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,789
Speaker 0: Oh my god This shit is going Mario.

45
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:40,987
Speaker 0: It's weird because this basically destroys the competition Completely, but what is the competition Mario Kart?

46
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,831
Speaker 0: It's like they're killing them.

47
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:52,160
Speaker 0: every other multiplayer game that they make is now worthless Because the only game anyone is gonna play when there is more than one person with a 3ds is Smash Bros.

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,806
Speaker 1: What about what about the new Tetris?

49
00:02:54,849 --> 00:03:02,960
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll play that but I mean it's gonna be if there's a free demo of Smash Bros In the in the e-shop so you can go play that now It's pretty much Smash Bros.

50
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,091
Speaker 0: The only problem I have with it is that the controls.

51
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:11,990
Speaker 0: they're trying to mimic the GameCube controls and in the demo You can't go to the settings and change them because just a demo.

52
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,280
Speaker 0: so jump is why and right because they're Mike.

53
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,375
Speaker 0: They're mimicking the GameCube which but on a 3ds that's backwards.

54
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,543
Speaker 0: I don't want to jump with the button That's at the top.

55
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:25,238
Speaker 0: I want to attack at that button and jump with B and then right.

56
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,279
Speaker 0: so That's annoying at least our and I'll do the right thing.

57
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:35,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll have to see what we do there because the game It's gonna take over the world pretty much in terms of handheld gaming.

58
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:47,014
Speaker 0: and then when the Wii U one comes out I think only like serious people who are like either people have we use are gonna get it obviously But people are serious about competing if it proves competitively viable.

59
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:56,032
Speaker 0: unlike the previous Smash Brothers they will get the Wii U one for their tournaments and such but The 3ds one I think is really gonna be the one that takes the cake.

60
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,823
Speaker 1: well because the Wii U is up and also ran At this point.

61
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:04,586
Speaker 0: in other news on the iPad you can now get the free-to-play Pokemon trading card game.

62
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:06,613
Speaker 0: it was available on a way.

63
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:11,533
Speaker 0: It still is available on a web version But now on the iPad a Nintendo game.

64
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:14,650
Speaker 1: Oh Shit, so we'll see.

65
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,260
Speaker 1: I mean we're not gonna review it from the demo.

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,707
Speaker 1: We're gonna wait for the real game to come out.

67
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:18,911
Speaker 0: I purred on Amazon.

68
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just waiting for it to arrive and then we'll play.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Speaker 1: I Think at least all my original concerns.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,240
Speaker 1: I was worried because of what they did to Mario Tennis that they were gonna do the same thing to smash.

71
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,730
Speaker 1: But I think they at least Mario Tennis like they're making.

72
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:48,978
Speaker 0: it does seem like they're putting in some effort to appeal to the competitive Gaming scene, but the problem is is I'm not good enough at smash to be able to tell on my own Whether this smash is competitively viable because my fingers are not fast, and I don't know how to wave - or anything like that.

73
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,000
Speaker 0: so We need to consult an expert on these matters.

74
00:04:53,662 --> 00:05:04,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the other trouble is just that you know they ruined Mario - Mario Tennis is no longer a skill game It's just Simon says which Mario Tennis the newest Mario Tennis on the 3ds.

75
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,899
Speaker 1: That's true and Mario Kart was pretty good.

76
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,855
Speaker 1: So I feel like there's a lot of inconsistency.

77
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:18,902
Speaker 1: like they they've decided They see certain games as being competitive, and I feel like if you're not one of those games fuck you Mmm.

78
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:28,050
Speaker 1: They're going cuz you know that old thing about how Team Fortress 2 was way more popular among the players When they made it more random without telling them what they did.

79
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:40,040
Speaker 1: so I wonder if Nintendo is going down the road of making games fun quote-unquote fun for players on average Irrespective of other concerns like tests of skill.

80
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:48,020
Speaker 0: That's sort of the perfect storm of that because in terms of fun It's like default mode is items on but they let you turn items off.

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,630
Speaker 1: That's it the fact that they let you turn the items off?

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,843
Speaker 1: all their games have not let you do that as much so by Default?

83
00:05:53,883 --> 00:06:03,160
Speaker 0: it's crazy fun for everyone, but the hardcore people It's crazy fun for everyone, but the hardcore people can then make it hardcore, so it's fun for them as well.

84
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:08,780
Speaker 0: So it's like imagine if an FPS didn't have invert y-axis.

85
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:13,443
Speaker 0: Well everyone could play except rim and Scott Johnson Mmm.

86
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:24,920
Speaker 0: My muscle memories to the point to where there's no backing away from that, but then I imagine if a Spaceship free space shooting game like x-wing released today did not have invert y-axis.

87
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,699
Speaker 1: What if a game like that just didn't support joysticks?

88
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,964
Speaker 0: And wouldn't exist?

89
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,391
Speaker 1: yeah, well joysticks.

90
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,240
Speaker 1: Don't exist, but that says a whole separate show.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,501
Speaker 1: We should.

92
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,417
Speaker 0: I would buy a copy to set on fire, but that would mean I have to buy a cop.

93
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:36,659
Speaker 0: yeah.

94
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:43,246
Speaker 1: So uh in other news five nights at Freddy's I'm amazed so my I'm surprised.

95
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:48,820
Speaker 0: so my co-workers started talking about wait wait independently of me this I didn't even know it existed.

96
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:55,300
Speaker 0: They started talking about it in relation to something and then a couple days later rim talked about it.

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,324
Speaker 0: And I'm like whoa.

98
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:06,913
Speaker 1: this is why I'm amazed because at the same time like when I was talking to you about it you did not know much about it and I only knew from that conversation with my co-workers and the steam store page.

99
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:17,210
Speaker 1: my co-workers never heard of it But I ran afoul of it in internet circles from day one Mm-hmm like I knew about this game when it was.

100
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,800
Speaker 0: pretty much you knew about it early on when it was way early.

101
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:25,890
Speaker 1: Okay, so and I'm not gonna get into the story of how it was made or anything We'll do a full show on it at some point if she's got a kickstarter or something.

102
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:32,320
Speaker 1: so the game itself is Is Legitimately terrifying.

103
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,786
Speaker 0: Not in not a baby.

104
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:37,697
Speaker 1: No no not in the sense of like Yamashibai like.

105
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,303
Speaker 1: oh my god It's scary.

106
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:41,772
Speaker 0: I'm scared by anything since I was like two.

107
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,819
Speaker 1: so can a jump scare get you?

108
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:45,444
Speaker 0: It's not scary.

109
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:46,608
Speaker 0: That's a surprise.

110
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:47,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott.

111
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's the thing there's.

112
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,640
Speaker 1: there's a gradient between surprise and scared.

113
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,969
Speaker 1: I did not say the game scared me.

114
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,495
Speaker 1: I said it terrified me.

115
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:54,856
Speaker 1: Okay.

116
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,860
Speaker 1: Here's what happened.

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,960
Speaker 0: I think terrified is just extreme for is the same thing is scared only to a greater degree?

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,285
Speaker 1: No, I would say that terrified is extreme fearful surprise Yeah, you.

119
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,087
Speaker 1: so here's the thing.

120
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:11,080
Speaker 1: the game does not pretend that it's not getting you with jump scares.

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,011
Speaker 1: In fact in the very beginning when you started it says warning.

122
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,198
Speaker 1: This game is basically just jump scares.

123
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:25,140
Speaker 1: great so, you know who you know and It uses jump scares Effectively to punish you for failing.

124
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:30,385
Speaker 1: so as a result you're playing the game and Then my experience.

125
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:32,837
Speaker 1: I start playing the game and I kind of know what the deal is and I play.

126
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,062
Speaker 1: through night one It was pretty good.

127
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:40,865
Speaker 1: But in night two when shit got real and the game was even like yo dog shits real now It tells you shit's about to go.

128
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:45,197
Speaker 1: basically my heart rate was going up because the game is just extremely playing.

129
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,365
Speaker 0: at a biometric sensor I could feel it.

130
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,920
Speaker 1: My heart was pounding because the game is very stressful to play.

131
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:54,974
Speaker 1: You have to be paying attention to all these things constantly.

132
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,380
Speaker 0: You haven't even told people what the game is.

133
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,207
Speaker 1: yeah, so because I'm saying this is why the game got me.

134
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:09,500
Speaker 1: and then the moment happened where the game you're like I lost and The jump scare thing was about to happen and I knew a jump scare was coming.

135
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:16,400
Speaker 1: So what I did is I leaned back from my monitor Folded my arms and I kind of looked away just like waiting for it to happen.

136
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,920
Speaker 1: Like you do if you run you look at one of those like jump scare kind of memes.

137
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,920
Speaker 1: So I'm just waiting for it to happen and then I'm gonna restart the game and it just doesn't happen.

138
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:34,446
Speaker 1: it doesn't happen and it doesn't happen and I Literally Lee like I lean in a little bit and then it happens and I take the mouse and I move it to see if like The game crashed.

139
00:09:34,728 --> 00:09:35,312
Speaker 0: and then it happened.

140
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:36,400
Speaker 0: Have you moved the mouse?

141
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,489
Speaker 0: He wasn't gonna do it if you weren't there, but then I thought back.

142
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,800
Speaker 1: the game warned me that moving the mouse would do it.

143
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:44,503
Speaker 0: Oh did it?

144
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,509
Speaker 1: so so here's the deal.

145
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,360
Speaker 1: The game is very simple.

146
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:53,317
Speaker 1: You are working minimum wage the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant.

147
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,641
Speaker 0: in other words, Chuck E. Cheese Chuck E.

148
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,209
Speaker 1: Cheese's Freddy Fazbear and there's some other.

149
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,580
Speaker 0: there's four animatronic suits in other words the rock of fire explosion.

150
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,171
Speaker 1: So your job is to sit there for midnight until 6 a.m.

151
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,117
Speaker 1: And be the night watchman.

152
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:06,940
Speaker 0: you can't okay.

153
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,910
Speaker 0: So Chuck E. Cheese's don't have night watchman first of all.

154
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this automated security systems if anything Yeah, so this one has.

155
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,040
Speaker 0: they also I don't think have rock of fire explosions at Chuck E. Cheese.

156
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,068
Speaker 0: They just have arcade games and cranes and shit.

157
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,340
Speaker 1: So you're really gonna try to make this a realistic game here.

158
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,847
Speaker 1: You're gonna really pick it apart on that level.

159
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:24,129
Speaker 1: Yes.

160
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:25,134
Speaker 1: So here's what.

161
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:25,556
Speaker 1: here's the deal.

162
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,420
Speaker 1: You're sitting there in the room.

163
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,544
Speaker 1: You cannot leave the room.

164
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:31,919
Speaker 1: The only controls you have is you can move the mouse to look left or right.

165
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,714
Speaker 1: There's open doors to the left and to the right.

166
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:35,599
Speaker 0: Why are there two doors?

167
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,464
Speaker 0: That's just like the security.

168
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,170
Speaker 0: main security room is a weird-ass building.

169
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:39,873
Speaker 0: who made this thing?

170
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,720
Speaker 1: the labs actually really straightforward.

171
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,577
Speaker 1: You're sitting in a room.

172
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:47,236
Speaker 1: There's two hallways that go out from either side of you into like different areas of the complex.

173
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,240
Speaker 0: Chuck E. Cheese has hallways.

174
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,980
Speaker 0: It's a big open building with like a kitchen for the pizza.

175
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:56,580
Speaker 1: Yeah Like the back hallways like where they store the animatronic suits that they're working on and like the arcade games.

176
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,002
Speaker 1: They need issues.

177
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,268
Speaker 0: They don't have those things.

178
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:01,000
Speaker 0: They send them away in a truck and the kitchen and all that stuff.

179
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,345
Speaker 1: Plus you're talking about Chuck E. Cheese's.

180
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,470
Speaker 1: This is Freddy Fazbear's.

181
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:05,016
Speaker 0: Okay, totally different place.

182
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:05,940
Speaker 0: This is a fancy place.

183
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:18,893
Speaker 1: Well, it's coming down on rough times Because if you're playing the game you'll do like you see a newspaper like pinned up to the wall and if you read it Like a kid got bit by one of the animatronics or something like that.

184
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,197
Speaker 0: They're on a stage.

185
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,000
Speaker 0: No one goes near them.

186
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:23,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently kid went and fucked with one of them.

187
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,535
Speaker 0: Well, then he gets what he deserves.

188
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:25,700
Speaker 0: They get electrocuted by that shit.

189
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently he made it a surprising amount of time without his frontal lobe after the bite of 87 Great.

190
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:36,440
Speaker 1: So the game the conceit of the game for getting your bullshit is that you sit in this room?

191
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,183
Speaker 1: You can't leave.

192
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,733
Speaker 1: The only controls you have are look right look left.

193
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:41,079
Speaker 0: Why can't you leave you tied down?

194
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,464
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like there's no way out.

195
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,147
Speaker 1: You're stuck in the room.

196
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,172
Speaker 1: Who knows?

197
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:44,393
Speaker 1: Why?

198
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,201
Speaker 0: Okay, so you did so.

199
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,790
Speaker 1: it's one of those disempowering things.

200
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,883
Speaker 1: you can move the mouse down and that

201
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,011
Speaker 0: look at your junk pulls

202
00:11:52,252 --> 00:12:02,500
Speaker 1: up a view a display in front of your face like physically like it pulls up in front of you and then you can see all the Security cameras and you click on the map on all the cameras and you see what that camera sees.

203
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,646
Speaker 1: You can't control the camera.

204
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:07,880
Speaker 1: camera like moves back and forth does its own thing in that room But you can look at that camera.

205
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:09,387
Speaker 1: You can look at anything cameras.

206
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 1: if you move the mouse back up the console goes back down.

207
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,235
Speaker 1: You're looking at the room again.

208
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:20,737
Speaker 1: You can shut the door to the left or right and you can turn on the light in the hallway right there to the left or to the right.

209
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:28,120
Speaker 1: as Long as you are using the camera have a light on or have a door closed your power consumption increases.

210
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,507
Speaker 1: Okay, this place has limited power.

211
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:33,720
Speaker 1: They're trying to save budget and the doors are open by default.

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,267
Speaker 1: It takes power to hold them closed.

213
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,994
Speaker 0: What is what kind of shitty door?

214
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,240
Speaker 0: Just the wooden doors, right?

215
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,967
Speaker 1: No, they're steel security doors.

216
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,338
Speaker 0: What the fuck are the Steel's electronic?

217
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:48,678
Speaker 1: Yeah So Scott if you play this game the the vibe is that what kind of fucked up join is this?

218
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,680
Speaker 0: Yeah What kind of?

219
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:54,660
Speaker 1: So you're in this room with steel security doors and they default open.

220
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,199
Speaker 1: So if the power runs out all the lights go out and the doors open.

221
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,220
Speaker 0: Doors default to closed.

222
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:04,013
Speaker 1: No, so imagine imagine a safety like a fire code thing where.

223
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:05,879
Speaker 0: imagine a grocery store with power doors.

224
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:07,879
Speaker 0: They closed if the power stop.

225
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:15,720
Speaker 1: So imagine a grocery store where the doors if they're closed and the power goes out They default to closed and you can't get out because there's still security doors.

226
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,744
Speaker 1: Everyone strapped inside.

227
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:20,477
Speaker 0: you just move them with their hands because they have manual controls because their doors.

228
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:21,340
Speaker 0: you can open them with their hands.

229
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, this place has a steel security doors that nothing can break.

230
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:25,980
Speaker 1: through these things.

231
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:27,628
Speaker 0: You can pull them open with their hands.

232
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:28,492
Speaker 0: No, they're way.

233
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:29,256
Speaker 0: they weigh like a ton.

234
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,000
Speaker 0: They're they have a knob.

235
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:30,823
Speaker 1: No, there's.

236
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:30,984
Speaker 1: no.

237
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:35,040
Speaker 1: now these are the kinds of doors like on the outside of a blast furnace.

238
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,660
Speaker 1: They're like the doors you would put on the outside of a light saber to cut through.

239
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, nuclear bunker door and a chuggy cheese.

240
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:42,417
Speaker 1: Yeah.

241
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:52,834
Speaker 1: So you're sitting there and you get a phone call like a voicemail from the guy who did your job like the previous week Like hey, dude, here's how to do the job.

242
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,099
Speaker 1: Keep an eye on him.

243
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,143
Speaker 0: So he still lived.

244
00:13:55,745 --> 00:14:00,180
Speaker 1: and what he warns you is that these animatronic suits they're AI controlled.

245
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:06,128
Speaker 1: so during the day like they do their thing on their own they're programmed and At night, they like to roam around.

246
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,360
Speaker 1: because if you don't let him move around at night their servers lock up or whatever.

247
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,185
Speaker 1: he doesn't know or care.

248
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:10,930
Speaker 1: that's just how it is.

249
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:19,384
Speaker 1: and Part of the AI is that if they see an exoskeleton that's not inside of the animatronic suit That's against the rules.

250
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:20,829
Speaker 1: So they will put it in a suit.

251
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,580
Speaker 1: They'll go they'll take it and they'll shove it into a suit.

252
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:26,980
Speaker 1: Okay They see a human being after hours.

253
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:35,837
Speaker 1: They think it's an exoskeleton they shove it into a suit and because that suits full of a bunch of metal and electronics That's pretty much guaranteed to horribly kill you.

254
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:48,400
Speaker 0: Okay, so if they see how strong are they I could I mean if I lay are huge and powerful But if I'm standing there if I meet the real rock of fire explosion, I can just kick one of those fuckers over and smash.

255
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:49,584
Speaker 0: It's not that durable.

256
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:54,139
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, these things can overpower a human being so they're basically the Terminator.

257
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,248
Speaker 0: Yes So if why is the Terminator?

258
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:57,433
Speaker 0: we're getting a Chuck E. Cheese.

259
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:01,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know on the fourth night You should be going to save John kind on the third or fourth night.

260
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:09,882
Speaker 1: The guy's voicemail is basically like yes So and the guy's like I think this place kind of fucked up Vietnam.

261
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:14,200
Speaker 1: I feel like you should go check on like what's in those other suits in the supply room.

262
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,291
Speaker 0: And the third night after the first night, why don't you quit?

263
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:18,595
Speaker 1: cuz you need this money.

264
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:23,700
Speaker 1: I can get money elsewhere Maybe not because your name is Mike Schmidt and you probably need money the best.

265
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:25,267
Speaker 0: You know what?

266
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:25,488
Speaker 0: I'll do.

267
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,400
Speaker 0: I'll just rob this fucking place and leave if you win the game.

268
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,724
Speaker 0: Possible, you know what it gives you.

269
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:35,600
Speaker 1: It just shows you you made a hundred and twenty dollars by surviving this bullshit.

270
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,103
Speaker 0: Oh, you beat it.

271
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:37,007
Speaker 1: Yeah.

272
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,992
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't beat it.

273
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,500
Speaker 1: I I went looked up a spoiler.

274
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:40,989
Speaker 1: so the way.

275
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,090
Speaker 1: so you're sitting there in the game and You get these warnings and then you look at the stage.

276
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,820
Speaker 1: there's three animatronic suits and you look at pirate Cove.

277
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:48,864
Speaker 1: There's a fourth suit.

278
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,937
Speaker 1: You can't see this behind a curtain and that's the whole game.

279
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:52,540
Speaker 1: They roam around.

280
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:55,770
Speaker 1: They you got to keep an eye on them.

281
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,611
Speaker 1: They all follow different rules and Shit's kind of terrifying.

282
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:00,740
Speaker 1: I don't want to spoil stuff.

283
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,748
Speaker 1: I feel like you guys should play it.

284
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,039
Speaker 1: cuz it's such a short game.

285
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,329
Speaker 1: I'll give you two example of some shit that went down.

286
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,076
Speaker 1: So I look at the stage.

287
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:07,960
Speaker 1: all three suits are there.

288
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,143
Speaker 0: Tell you about my character.

289
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,929
Speaker 1: and then I look at pirate Cove.

290
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,740
Speaker 1: the the curtains closed and then I see some sort of hallucination.

291
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,984
Speaker 1: That happens occasionally.

292
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:22,120
Speaker 1: and then I look at the pirate Cove and I look at the stage again and Bonnie the bunnies gone.

293
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:23,735
Speaker 0: I just go chill out in the pirate Cove.

294
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,239
Speaker 1: You can't move.

295
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,959
Speaker 1: I'll see if you go there it'll see you and it'll kill you.

296
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:30,200
Speaker 1: So I look at the stage and Bonnie's gone body the bunnies gone.

297
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,725
Speaker 1: So I started looking around.

298
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,759
Speaker 1: I find her on the camera and she's like in the hallway kind of near me.

299
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:45,492
Speaker 1: So it turns out that the cameras actually have a blind spot as the guy warns you on the phone Right next to your doors.

300
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,750
Speaker 1: So Eventually, I can't find Bonnie the bunny like.

301
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,473
Speaker 1: look at all the cameras.

302
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,698
Speaker 1: I just can't fucking find her.

303
00:16:51,643 --> 00:17:00,314
Speaker 1: then I just pull out of that pull out of the camera and I click on the light and she is right fucking outside the door looking inside and I slammed the door shut.

304
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:00,896
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

305
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:01,739
Speaker 1: She doesn't kill me.

306
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:09,058
Speaker 1: Then I pull the camera up to look for Chica the chicken cuz he like is wandering around somewhere.

307
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,255
Speaker 1: I couldn't find him I don't see him.

308
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:22,611
Speaker 1: and then suddenly the fun that the chicken pulls the camera down and kills me out of Nowhere and it scared the ever-living fuck out of me.

309
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:24,680
Speaker 0: Okay, so why do you use the cameras at all?

310
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,693
Speaker 0: Why don't you just only use the lights and close the doors when necessary?

311
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,300
Speaker 1: Ah, so here here's the spoiler.

312
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:44,751
Speaker 1: So the the suit that's hanging out in Pirate Cove who Foxy the pirate is pretty cool guy he if you don't look at him enough or if you look at him too much because you're paranoid.

313
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:53,804
Speaker 1: he slowly activates and Eventually, like if you look in the room and he's not there anymore like he'll open the curtain He's kind of looking at you.

314
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,900
Speaker 1: then he's like hanging out in front of the curtain like in front of the auto-order side.

315
00:17:58,845 --> 00:17:59,811
Speaker 1: One time I looked in there.

316
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,220
Speaker 1: he's gone just gone.

317
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,943
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh fuck.

318
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:09,259
Speaker 1: and then I look at the hallway and he's literally sprinting down the hallway toward my door Mm-hmm, and he'll just come and kill you.

319
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:26,608
Speaker 1: Okay, the game punishes players If they fail with jump scares and the jump scares are artfully designed Such that even if you were an intelligent human being who thinks I won't be gotten by the jump scare It'll jump scare you anyway.

320
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,756
Speaker 0: the game anyone can beat jumps.

321
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:35,937
Speaker 1: the game is Clever in ways that I don't want to reveal because I feel like you should explore and experience these things yourself.

322
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,818
Speaker 1: it Legitimately raised my heart rate.

323
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:51,678
Speaker 1: it gave me an adrenaline rush like a for-real one the same feeling you get when a car almost hit you while you're biking and it's just generally extremely stressful and frustrating to play in a really fun way.

324
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:56,494
Speaker 1: I Highly recommend you try five nights at Freddy's.

325
00:18:56,856 --> 00:19:01,109
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, Scott hates games like this interrupted me trying to explain it.

326
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:03,957
Speaker 1: But obviously guys this game is great and you should play it.

327
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,253
Speaker 1: I Don't know why you're so a on it.

328
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,834
Speaker 1: I mean, why would you be at the game use it?

329
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:13,730
Speaker 1: It's it does horror and How is it not horror?

330
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,951
Speaker 1: What?

331
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:15,079
Speaker 1: how could you make a horror game then?

332
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,283
Speaker 0: An intelligent person can't be scared Uh-huh.

333
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,290
Speaker 1: So there's no such thing as horror ever.

334
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:22,314
Speaker 1: There's no horror fiction.

335
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,238
Speaker 1: There's no horror movies.

336
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:23,800
Speaker 0: Not for me.

337
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,673
Speaker 1: So there's no such thing as a genre of horror.

338
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:30,110
Speaker 0: back when I was a kid I can watch alien and I was scared.

339
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:36,350
Speaker 0: Scott horror doesn't mean it scares you But now I can watch anything and be not scared.

340
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,035
Speaker 1: That doesn't make it not horror.

341
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,640
Speaker 0: It makes it not hard.

342
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,954
Speaker 1: Why horror doesn't necessarily mean scare?

343
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:46,870
Speaker 0: I do know one thing though Joe out and go boo is not scary.

344
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,318
Speaker 1: horrors can be existential crisis.

345
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:56,180
Speaker 1: also I think you misunderstand the definitions of horror and macabre and scare and all those different words.

346
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:04,574
Speaker 1: I think you use a very reductionist definition system I think because you have no joy from games and no joy from jump-scare.

347
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,500
Speaker 0: I think that you are a baby.

348
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,387
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll put this so clever thing.

349
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,092
Speaker 1: Freddy Fazbear fucking.

350
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,880
Speaker 1: he got into the room and I had both doors shut.

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,205
Speaker 1: So I gotta figure out how that works.

352
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:17,312
Speaker 0: But uh, he was already in the room.

353
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:29,092
Speaker 1: as he comes to kill you You'll notice that on his face are two pretty clear handprints Obviously from someone else he killed trying to resist him.

354
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,440
Speaker 1: There's a lot of subtle things like that.

355
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,612
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day because Scott has no joy from games.

356
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,976
Speaker 0: We should watch my thing today.

357
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:42,959
Speaker 1: No, I did not.

358
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,314
Speaker 1: I was busy setting up the stream.

359
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:46,200
Speaker 1: that appears to be failing.

360
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:52,360
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day this dude His only flaw in his entire life was being a Phoenix Coyotes fan.

361
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,211
Speaker 0: If you did not know hockey is soon preseason.

362
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,640
Speaker 0: hockey is now it is hockey time.

363
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,857
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did pretty good at hockey last year.

364
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,377
Speaker 0: So hockey this year of course is even more exciting than usual which is the most exciting sport can possibly be.

365
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:10,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, so This guy this Phoenix Coyotes fan.

366
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:11,933
Speaker 0: He set up a thing in his house.

367
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:13,840
Speaker 0: That is the glory of glories.

368
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:20,000
Speaker 0: He took two Lights the kind of light that caught a detective will put on top of his car.

369
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,416
Speaker 0: Alright, he put him side by side.

370
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:32,230
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, so if there's a goal of his television, he also connected to this system his stereo.

371
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,219
Speaker 0: if There is a goal.

372
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,140
Speaker 0: He pushes a button on the remote and there are four different song selections to play in the event of goal.

373
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:42,008
Speaker 0: It is glorious.

374
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:43,660
Speaker 0: It is majestic.

375
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:50,629
Speaker 0: I need to set this up in everyone's house that in case I watch hockey at their house I can press the button.

376
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,605
Speaker 0: the only thing I can play the same music They play at Madison Square Garden.

377
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,111
Speaker 0: when there's a goal you need a crowd.

378
00:21:55,191 --> 00:22:02,740
Speaker 1: at the authentic home Arena experience you need a crowd that or a crowd simulator in your house.

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,594
Speaker 0: Is there a market for this simulate being at the arena in your house?

380
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:11,438
Speaker 0: Once we have like oculus rift It's it's like you're at the arena even though you're at your house.

381
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,270
Speaker 0: Everyone everyone is sitting at center ice everybody for me.

382
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,059
Speaker 1: There is definitely definitely a market for this.

383
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:25,303
Speaker 0: I would buy if I could watch live sports as if I'm in the arena and it feels like I'm in the arena and looks Like I'm in the arena.

384
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,490
Speaker 0: I would buy an oculus drift for that.

385
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:28,454
Speaker 0: get on it.

386
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:29,999
Speaker 0: I know listeners work there.

387
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:36,557
Speaker 0: I don't think you listen though But there are people I know who work there and I'm gonna tell them.

388
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:38,965
Speaker 1: The thing is you need you need.

389
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:49,642
Speaker 1: the crowd simulator would have to simulate the physical feeling of a human being Jumping up next to you and elbow you in the face as he yells and screams at the top of his lungs getting beer spilled On you.

390
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:54,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need a delivery company to bring the proper food The smells the cold.

391
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,759
Speaker 0: you got to get the temperature of the ice, you know, you could be cold put on a coat.

392
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,074
Speaker 0: Where your Jersey?

393
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,446
Speaker 0: Yeah You know the whole thing.

394
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,298
Speaker 1: so my thinking today this was this is one of those things It was funnier than it had any right to be.

395
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,045
Speaker 1: it's called super bad Mario.

396
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:09,487
Speaker 1: just a video.

397
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:19,859
Speaker 1: someone made of bunch of people having a fail video moment and They have added Mario such that Mario is the cause of their fail.

398
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:22,739
Speaker 1: That sounds like a really simple and dumb idea.

399
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:24,205
Speaker 1: Shits hilarious.

400
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,434
Speaker 1: It's way funnier than it should be.

401
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:27,176
Speaker 0: It's alright.

402
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:27,799
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

403
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:31,291
Speaker 0: This feels like old-school internet like five ten years ago.

404
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:33,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, like blumpy org kind of stuff.

405
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm into this.

406
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,707
Speaker 1: It's doing them at a moment.

407
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,295
Speaker 1: The book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

408
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:38,259
Speaker 1: I guess Scott finished it.

409
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,436
Speaker 0: I'm very close to finishing it now that what very close.

410
00:23:41,557 --> 00:23:43,928
Speaker 0: I'll finish it Tonight or tomorrow night.

411
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,419
Speaker 1: Did you get to the Green Star part?

412
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:51,955
Speaker 0: No, I'm at the part where they're about to get in a spaceship to leave because it's not good.

413
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,840
Speaker 1: who's getting on a spaceship?

414
00:23:55,643 --> 00:24:00,000
Speaker 1: Catholics, yeah That pretty much sums up a canticle for Liebowitz.

415
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:04,497
Speaker 1: I feel like I could review each of the three sections complete like I have a completely different.

416
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:04,958
Speaker 1: Yes.

417
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,686
Speaker 0: Yes That's how it's gonna go down.

418
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,293
Speaker 0: So let's get to the main bit.

419
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:09,474
Speaker 0: Yeah.

420
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:10,800
Speaker 0: Oh, is there any other meta moments?

421
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,652
Speaker 1: Yes, so we're live streaming this but it appears to have failed on multiple fronts.

422
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:16,635
Speaker 0: bad technology.

423
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see.

424
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,548
Speaker 1: I'm giving YouTube some or Google some feedback.

425
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:23,399
Speaker 0: We're actually working with YouTube on some streaming stuff.

426
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:26,733
Speaker 0: Basically, we're giving them feedback on the streaming stuff.

427
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, so YouTube streaming.

428
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:32,439
Speaker 0: look out on our both of our channels for streaming YouTube type stuff.

429
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:42,900
Speaker 0: Yeah Really, you know actually started another channel separate from my main channel for that because like we've used which reviews YouTube and YouTube is just From a streamers point of view technology wise.

430
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:44,805
Speaker 0: YouTube is just better.

431
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:48,093
Speaker 0: the major flaws the audience that twitch brings.

432
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,390
Speaker 0: like I can start a gaming a game on twitch and people will Find me and start watching who don't even know me.

433
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, not so much on YouTube.

434
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:57,547
Speaker 1: So, yeah, the only other things are packs.

435
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:58,489
Speaker 1: Australia is coming up.

436
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,978

438
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:17,833

439
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:19,140
Speaker 0: I should buy flights to pack south.

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,469
Speaker 1: I am now attending five fucking packs as a year.

441

443
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,916
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

444
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:35,380

446
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:52,460
Speaker 1: Uh prime's tabletop was a little sub optimal due to the fact that the library was in the Convention Center And all the actual gaming space was in a faraway.

447
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:03,260
Speaker 0: we're still gaming tables in the Convention Center as usual, but not many mad crowded full hard to get into and Also, basically it ended up it was a pain in the ass to use the game library.

448
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,668
Speaker 1: So we never checked anything out of the game library.

449
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,920
Speaker 1: So we were dependent solely on games that we collectively brought.

450
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:12,558
Speaker 1: Our friends brought a game called Pandante.

451
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,860
Speaker 0: Pandante is made by Serlin games who you may know from such other games as Yomi and puzzle strike.

452
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:33,408
Speaker 0: Serlin is the dude who sort of thinks the same things that we do is all about winning and playing a win and stuff like that and he's a dude who is like big in the fighting game community, but Wasn't as good at moving his hands really fast.

453
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,798
Speaker 0: He's much better at it than we are but not you know Not good enough to be pro.

454
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:49,380
Speaker 0: That's why he made games like Yomi and puzzle strike which are like these skill-winning type games that lets you Experience that high-level interplay without needing to master basic low-level skills along the way.

455
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,100
Speaker 0: So the new game from Serlin games relatively new at least is Pandante.

456
00:26:53,482 --> 00:27:01,313
Speaker 1: This is the kind of game that and when we describe it to you, you'll feel this It's the kind of game that people like us usually will ignore or shut up.

457
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:01,734
Speaker 0: Right?

458
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:06,627
Speaker 0: So it's Texas holding poker With two key differences, right?

459
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:10,779
Speaker 0: There are other differences, but there are two key differences difference number one pandas.

460
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:12,585
Speaker 0: Difference number two.

461
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:22,540
Speaker 1: It's a different deck of cards not usual deck of cards Yep, and and it's interesting because what this game does at its core is it takes say Texas?

462
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:29,630
Speaker 1: Hold them which you need to be good at poker to enjoy, Texas Hold them pretty much or have so much money.

463
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,814
Speaker 0: You don't care that you lose.

464
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,520
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to play for money.

465
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,645
Speaker 1: I mean we didn't play this for money.

466
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,974
Speaker 0: Wow, Texas hold them without money is good.

467
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,219
Speaker 1: Well, then you're just playing for points.

468
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:38,626
Speaker 0: but that's the thing.

469
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:41,058
Speaker 1: the if you play Texas hold them.

470
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:51,239
Speaker 1: the Differentiator of skill between like the person who's got like nine points of skill the person who has eight point eight points Only comes out over a long period of play.

471
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,900
Speaker 1: pandante Distills that so that it's a relatively short game.

472
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:07,175
Speaker 1: It plays more like a German board game or like the kind of table of games we like and you get the brain Feel and the excitement of the important rounds of Texas.

473
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:16,153
Speaker 1: hold them without having to play 100 rounds of Texas hold them and without having for most of them Everyone just folds right away exactly and they're for almost no money.

474
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:20,127
Speaker 0: And then the big one happens exactly Dante Every round is the big round.

475
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:23,539
Speaker 1: So this game much like I said for that my thing of the day video.

476
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:28,636
Speaker 1: It's a game that has is way more fun than has a right to be and we've resisted.

477
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:37,196
Speaker 1: when our friends are like Hey, let's play this game We were like we'll play it once So we can review it and then we finish and then we all relate it the most.

478
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:38,360
Speaker 1: so we should we play it again?

479
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:39,544
Speaker 1: Should we play it again?

480
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,352
Speaker 1: Should we play it again one night?

481
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:43,380
Speaker 1: We played it all night until they kicked us out.

482
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,063
Speaker 0: It was just really.

483
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,640
Speaker 0: the other thing is just so easy to play compared to other games that had much more setup.

484
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:52,780
Speaker 0: You know all this is just take a deck of cards shuffle them give everyone some chips and plates.

485
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,010
Speaker 0: You know, it's more set up than say sushi go.

486
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a lot less set up even than seven wonders.

487
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,968
Speaker 0: We got to sort all the cards out and everything.

488
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:04,120
Speaker 1: So the subtle key difference is to explain the game in detail.

489
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:04,885
Speaker 1: It's pretty simple.

490
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:06,879
Speaker 1: you play basically, Texas hold him.

491
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:13,420
Speaker 1: But when you buy into a hand and you bid on a hand, you're not just bidding like I have the best hand.

492
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:16,119
Speaker 1: You're not putting money in saying I got the best hand or fold.

493
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,316
Speaker 1: You're betting on what hand you will have by the end right.

494
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:23,820
Speaker 0: you're betting on a specific hand.

495
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:25,924
Speaker 0: There are ten hands You can possibly have.

496
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:30,260
Speaker 0: you put a chip onto one of them and you can't bet some crazy different amounts either.

497
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,946
Speaker 0: You can't be like all-in on pair.

498
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:35,560
Speaker 0: It's you bet a fixed amount or you quit, right?

499
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,835
Speaker 0: So it's either bet five on one of the ten hands or fold.

500
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:41,080
Speaker 0: Those are your two options.

501
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:44,011
Speaker 0: So I'll bet five on three of a kind.

502
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,517
Speaker 0: I have a three of a kind.

503
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:46,380
Speaker 0: is what you're saying?

504
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:48,170
Speaker 1: Yep, or I will.

505
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:49,959
Speaker 1: I will have three of a kind.

506
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,148
Speaker 0: I will eventually have three of a kind.

507
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,075
Speaker 0: not I will have at least three of a kind.

508
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:55,320
Speaker 0: not I will have.

509
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:58,080
Speaker 0: You know something, you know better than three.

510
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,749
Speaker 0: I will have exactly three of a kind.

511
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:03,249
Speaker 0: if you have four of a kind and you bet on three of a kind Well, I guess that includes three of a kind.

512
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,100
Speaker 0: but you don't get your credit for your four of a kind.

513
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,898
Speaker 0: You only get the credit for what you bet on.

514
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:22,171
Speaker 1: So the game works pretty much like Texas Hold'em in that regard though because you go down the river Pulling up cards along the way, but every time a new card comes out you have to bet you have to fold or Bet at or better than what you already bet on.

515
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:28,313
Speaker 0: so you might have like you might be going for I don't know an inside straight right and you think that's.

516
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:29,336
Speaker 1: that's a great idea.

517
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,360
Speaker 0: You might be getting it.

518
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,982
Speaker 0: You never know.

519
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:32,468
Speaker 0: You're not getting you're only gonna spend.

520
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:34,075
Speaker 0: you think I can spend ten bucks to see.

521
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,240
Speaker 0: maybe a miracle will happen.

522
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:44,917
Speaker 0: So you bet on straight and then you bet on straight again and Then you bet and meanwhile you just got like a three of a kind.

523
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,086
Speaker 0: but Sorry, bro.

524
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,049
Speaker 1: You can't go down.

525
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,680
Speaker 0: You know, you can't go down to three of a kind.

526
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,940
Speaker 0: So even though you have it, it's basically meaningless.

527
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:58,480
Speaker 1: So there's another mechanic here much like how Texas Hold'em has all of its terminology.

528
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,159
Speaker 1: It's poker terminology.

529
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:03,138
Speaker 1: Pandante has panda equivalents of that.

530
00:31:04,022 --> 00:31:12,065
Speaker 1: So you buy breakfast you buy you take breakfast if you want then you have snacks and then you do like the paws and the Tail and all these little things.

531
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:20,984
Speaker 1: so it has this fun little like interplay of using the words in the nomenclature of the game To the point that it started messing up my poker Brain.

532
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:23,955
Speaker 0: now the snacks are actually a big component in the game right.

533
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:32,069
Speaker 0: the way the snacks work is If you are the highest bidder in terms like I'm betting on straight blood Flush I got a flush.

534
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,455
Speaker 0: That's not as good as a straight flush.

535
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:34,400
Speaker 0: I got a flush good.

536
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:42,388
Speaker 0: If you are the highest better at any given snack time you get free snacks Which means from your you know hidden cards.

537
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:45,799
Speaker 0: you can throw some out and you draw a card and then?

538
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:49,720
Speaker 1: You may or may not keep that card throwing away another card.

539
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:54,760
Speaker 1: So you still have two cards, but you can swallow in and out by going big and betting big.

540
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:58,476
Speaker 0: You actually have a chance to make that big a reality.

541
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,480
Speaker 0: with all the snacks.

542
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:02,660
Speaker 0: You can still get snacks if you are not the highest better.

543
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:11,151
Speaker 0: But you have to pay for those snacks and the further away you are from the top the more you have to pay if you're Betting on pair and someone else is betting on straight flush.

544
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:17,072
Speaker 0: You have to pay like 20 bucks To have a chance at snacks, so there's already a good.

545
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,460
Speaker 1: You know because what's the fun part of Texas holding?

546
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,745
Speaker 1: What's the fun part of poker?

547
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:24,459
Speaker 0: the big bluffing and being and everyone falls for it?

548
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:26,593
Speaker 0: And you make mad money when you had nothing.

549
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:33,515
Speaker 1: this game distills poker into the bluffing and the odds and nothing else and it does it quickly.

550
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:44,213
Speaker 1: so I might I Might bet a flouche even though I could not possibly have a flouche And I intend to fold just to make everybody's snacks more expensive.

551
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:47,665
Speaker 0: and because I can see even though I can't possibly have a flouche.

552
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:50,274
Speaker 0: Maybe the snacks will make a flouche happen.

553
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:53,545
Speaker 0: Yeah, so And I'll get free snacks.

554
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:57,358
Speaker 1: the game obviously because the deck is not a normal poker deck.

555
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,447
Speaker 1: the Hands you can get our difference right.

556
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:03,014
Speaker 0: so there are six suits with ten cards pursued.

557
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:04,659
Speaker 0: number one Joker one through ten.

558
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:06,769
Speaker 0: When do you guys examine it?

559
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,910
Speaker 0: Oh?

560
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,634
Speaker 0: No is there a ten?

561
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:08,639
Speaker 0: Oh is it two through ten?

562
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,007
Speaker 1: I think it's one through ten.

563
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,514
Speaker 0: that would make eleven.

564
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, right What are you nine?

565
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:14,906
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

566
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:15,830
Speaker 0: I think it's two through ten.

567
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,800
Speaker 0: I don't remember anyway.

568
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:22,671
Speaker 0: Also the six colors, and then there's one wild card.

569
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:23,393
Speaker 0: Whoa.

570
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:24,397
Speaker 0: It's a wild card.

571
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,944
Speaker 0: Yeah watch out It's prismatic.

572
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:31,080
Speaker 1: It's got all the colors, and there's some fun rules around that, but there's only one wild card.

573
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,640
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's some special rules around the wild card.

574
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:49,780
Speaker 1: So you play the game you bet everybody bets you buy snacks if you want and then another card comes out in the in the community cards and then you bet snacks and you do this three times and Then the show everybody gets to use a power.

575
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:54,937
Speaker 0: So this is actually another bluffing aspect right based on the colors of the cards.

576
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:57,190
Speaker 0: in your hand There are six powers.

577
00:33:57,271 --> 00:34:03,800
Speaker 0: six colors six powers You can it goes around and each person gets to claim zero one or two powers.

578
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,268
Speaker 0: Right and try to use those powers.

579
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:09,739
Speaker 0: so I can be like I'm gonna do the red power twice.

580
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:14,760
Speaker 0: The red power is put five bucks in or if everyone puts five bucks in or folds.

581
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:21,063
Speaker 0: So doing that twice means everyone in the whole game has to put in ten bucks or fold except me because I'm using the power Right.

582
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:23,926
Speaker 0: oh No, I think I have to do it too right.

583
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:24,670
Speaker 1: What?

584
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,580
Speaker 1: no no you don't remember this game at all.

585
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,629
Speaker 0: I only played it effects.

586
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:28,496
Speaker 0: It was already a month ago.

587
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,610
Speaker 1: So bravery every other player must put in five gold right fold.

588
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,620
Speaker 1: so you evilness draw a card then discard a card.

589
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,679
Speaker 1: But you have to reveal a card that you kept.

590
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,731
Speaker 1: Orange deal a sixth community car.

591
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,255
Speaker 0: oh shit everybody gets that.

592
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,983
Speaker 0: it happens a lot of blue Privately.

593
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:48,449
Speaker 1: see a random card from a highest hand.

594
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:52,110
Speaker 1: so someone who's beating you as a highest hand you can see a card in their hand.

595
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:57,613
Speaker 1: Black the fun one greed steal five dollars from the lowest hand.

596
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,340
Speaker 1: unless they reveal a blue card from their hand.

597
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,460
Speaker 0: Hopelessness purple you get to fold because normally you can't fold at that point you're already in too deep.

598
00:35:06,942 --> 00:35:11,240
Speaker 0: But that's like last-minute folding so you can pull some shenanigans and then fold if they don't work.

599
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,660
Speaker 1: And there's a clever mechanic where if you use a power you can declare up to two powers because you can have two cards.

600
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,468
Speaker 1: You know your car.

601
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:18,418
Speaker 1: you have two cards in your hole.

602
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,871
Speaker 1: Anyone can challenge you and there's a challenge mechanic like you.

603
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,640
Speaker 0: you're not showing your two hidden cards, and you use these powers.

604
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,469
Speaker 0: I'm like I'm using two red powers red power twice.

605
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, people can either say okay.

606
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:35,571
Speaker 0: We'll do the red power twice or They can say challenge you you don't have two red cards.

607
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:40,780
Speaker 0: the cards are designed in such a way That you can reveal their color without revealing their number.

608
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,759
Speaker 1: So I have to then either say yeah, you got me, and then I owe them some money.

609
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they challenged me I was lying.

610
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:52,340
Speaker 1: I give them money or I show them the colors and then they owe me money.

611
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:54,020
Speaker 0: Yep, they challenged me, and they were wrong.

612
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,387
Speaker 0: I did have two red cards so they got to give me one which can be great.

613
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:05,871
Speaker 1: if say I'm Bluffing that I have a flouche and I show a card that corroborates my story that I have a flouche You

614
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:11,853
Speaker 0: might really need say to use the orange power to have a chance at this hand winning but

615
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:12,859
Speaker 1: using that don't have

616
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,228
Speaker 0: any orange cards or

617
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:19,284
Speaker 1: Using it implies that I don't have the hand and I'm hail marrying right

618
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,872
Speaker 0: or you might have a really shitty hand and want to Say purple.

619
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,630
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fold to just get escape, but you don't have a purple and someone calls you out on it.

620
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,527
Speaker 0: That's the worst.

621
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:32,756
Speaker 0: Or your hand is totally awesome And you want to kick some ass.

622
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:46,564
Speaker 0: so you use red or black to take money from people But you don't have red or black and you get called if you have the crazy awesome, and sometimes you'll use orange or green Just to make everyone think that you're actually bluffing.

623
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:50,300
Speaker 0: yeah, if you're using orange or green It seems like you're desperately trying to get a good hand.

624
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:56,470
Speaker 0: people think you don't have the real hand But all you did was just draw a card and throw one away, and then you go down the challenges.

625
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:05,150
Speaker 1: So after the powers after all that the cards are out there whoever has the highest hand Everyone has a chance to either challenge them right or say yeah, you win.

626
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:08,530
Speaker 0: I bet on five of a kind and no one else bet on anything close to five of a kind.

627
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:12,228
Speaker 0: I just win without revealing anything whatsoever unless you challenge me.

628
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:20,350
Speaker 1: so Challenges in this stage are interesting because in on normal challenges with the powers if you are wrong you owe the other person some money.

629
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,174
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal.

630
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:30,961
Speaker 1: if you challenge someone's hand And they're winning and you're right you get a little bit of money And of course they don't win mm-hmm in the neck meeting.

631
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,005
Speaker 0: that goes down to the next person.

632
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:35,879
Speaker 1: if you challenge someone And you're wrong they actually have the hand.

633
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,043
Speaker 0: I have five of a kind.

634
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,130
Speaker 0: read him and weep you are fucked.

635
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:41,646
Speaker 1: You owe them so much money.

636
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,016
Speaker 1: It is Devastated.

637
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:43,882
Speaker 0: you just lose the game.

638
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:44,587
Speaker 0: basically yeah.

639
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:57,410
Speaker 1: So if you are not challenged and you win and you were bluffing You can tell everyone yo dogs I was bluffing you're stupid.

640
00:37:57,972 --> 00:38:00,801
Speaker 1: And then you get to draw a panda Lord.

641
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,995
Speaker 0: this panda Lords are so ridiculously Waggles.

642
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,828
Speaker 1: all about waggles fuck everybody else.

643
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,889
Speaker 0: Pretty much only took waggles because he was so much better than the other pen.

644
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:14,170
Speaker 1: well I think we took waggles mostly because of the waggle action on the card.

645
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:16,149
Speaker 0: It's also an excellent reason to take waggles.

646
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:20,689
Speaker 1: But the panda Lord if you have him have one and you can just take one.

647
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,994
Speaker 1: There's one of every color.

648
00:38:22,696 --> 00:38:24,281
Speaker 1: they just have weird powers like waggles.

649
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,946
Speaker 1: power is the triple play quote.

650
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:33,010
Speaker 1: during the ability phase You can play up to three different abilities that cannot be challenged.

651
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:42,310
Speaker 0: So you could just be like red red red everyone put 15 in the middle or fold everyone right now And you lose waggles, but you know hey, that's ridiculously strong.

652
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:51,637
Speaker 0: Yeah So if you basically bluff your way to victory on one hand you get a panda Lord which comes close to Ensuring victory on a future hand.

653
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:59,087
Speaker 0: so when it does a huge incentive to win via bluffing So what look again the design of the game is?

654
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,730
Speaker 1: Pushing you toward the fun parts of poker And it's kind of glossing over the really really tedious parts of poker.

655
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:11,196
Speaker 0: But at the same so while it's basically pushes you huge incentives.

656
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:12,618
Speaker 0: Just bluff your way to victory.

657
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:30,582
Speaker 0: at the same time it ridiculously punishes anyone for Challenging if you're right, so it's like you have this built-in defense Making it sort of easier to actually bluff your way to victory because people are scared to challenge you if you actually have the hand Because they will just be fucked if you do have the hand.

658
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:39,965
Speaker 1: now in my experience playing the game Nobody ever fucking has the hand except that one time The early games pretty much that we played.

659
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:44,361
Speaker 0: of this everyone One person actually had the hand and someone challenged them.

660
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:45,604
Speaker 0: that person was out.

661
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,530
Speaker 0: the person who had the hand won the game the end.

662
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,669
Speaker 0: Because they just got so much money from that it was over.

663
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:54,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only did they get the money from winning the pot they got the money from the person who just got hosed.

664
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,843
Speaker 0: I think what happened is they had so much money.

665
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:57,850
Speaker 0: They couldn't be unseated.

666
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,897
Speaker 0: They won a second hand.

667
00:39:58,917 --> 00:39:59,381
Speaker 0: then they had.

668
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:00,609
Speaker 0: that was enough money to win the game.

669
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:05,224
Speaker 1: But then I think pretty quickly what happened is our friends started getting competent at the game.

670
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:15,508
Speaker 1: part of the problem was that it's not easy to calculate the odds or Viscerally feel the odds of the six color ten card deck.

671
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:19,801
Speaker 0: yeah It was very hard to calculate the likelihood of like.

672
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:20,643
Speaker 0: what are the odds?

673
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,010
Speaker 0: he has a flouche pretty good actually.

674
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,160
Speaker 0: There's like ten cards of that color right.

675
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,349
Speaker 0: so the odds of those is he's got two of them.

676
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:30,090
Speaker 1: So like a nice had like five snacks.

677
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:37,098
Speaker 0: He's seen like seven cards this game and plus the ones in the table It's like they could easily be well houses right.

678
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:40,570
Speaker 1: not that hard to get flushes slightly harder to get.

679
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:44,829
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's because it's on the far right side or because we just really like the word flouche.

680
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,241
Speaker 0: Only a panda would know what a flouche is.

681
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:52,221
Speaker 1: yep, it says in the instruction manual The game's flavor text and just that.

682
00:40:52,281 --> 00:41:00,146
Speaker 1: the art and everything on the cards was well done to the point that We started using its terminology despite making fun of how dumb its terminology was.

683
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:06,355
Speaker 1: when we learned the game Flouche became the breakaway word of PAX For the rest of the weekend.

684
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:10,630
Speaker 0: Yeah fuck your official swear word flouche is the official word of PAX Prime.

685
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:18,716
Speaker 1: I think the problem was we looked up flouche on Urban Dictionary and came up with something involving a female ejaculation whatever.

686
00:41:18,736 --> 00:41:29,877
Speaker 1: so a Few of us looked that up and laughed about it And then everyone else came back and then someone bet on a flouche who was not there when we had looked it up And that sealed the deal.

687
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:35,057
Speaker 0: the other thing about this game is all the pandas on the cards have really great Expressions especially the number one.

688
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,290
Speaker 0: where the pen is put in the red the pen is putting his hands in the air like what?

689
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:39,193
Speaker 0: Raise the roof.

690
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:46,830
Speaker 1: our convention was if you win you have to make the red one pose Unless you win with a panel or then you have to make the pose of that panel.

691
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,467
Speaker 0: Oh, but basically we kept making the poses of all the pandas and saying flouche a lot.

692
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:56,550
Speaker 1: Yeah This is a must-have in your game library.

693
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:01,468
Speaker 0: If you're the kind of takes up somewhat little space and you probably already have poker chips of some kind.

694
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:10,563
Speaker 1: if you're a gamer yeah, it's a deck of cards special deck of cards a couple of challenge cards and Little betting cards that remind you like what the order of this.

695
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,288
Speaker 0: you don't even really need the betting cards You really just need the deck.

696
00:42:13,673 --> 00:42:14,909
Speaker 1: I think you need the betting cards.

697
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:20,218
Speaker 0: So it'll tell you very helpful if people don't know how to play but once you're all good at the game You don't need that anymore.

698
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:21,670
Speaker 1: I think you'll always need them.

699
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,420
Speaker 1: So you will never forget the order of victory.

700
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:29,150
Speaker 0: if you play the game enough, you will know the order of victory.

701
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:32,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, just you're gonna remember that the straight is less than a full house less than a flouche.

702
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,530
Speaker 0: Yes, because it's much easier to get a straight when there's six suits.

703
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:39,761
Speaker 1: yep, but a rainbow straight versus four or five of a kind.

704
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:46,803
Speaker 0: a rainbow straight is less than four of a kind and less than five and I see you can see that over my shoulder because I have the betting.

705
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:49,573
Speaker 0: no because I remember that rainbow straight Is in the top left.

706
00:42:49,653 --> 00:43:02,700
Speaker 1: now flouche is in the bottom right and then just to the left of flouche should be Regular straight but seriously if you run board game nights if you were the guy who shows up at a con and has like hey I got a game we should play.

707
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,695
Speaker 1: this is The.

708
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:07,649
Speaker 1: this is like the perfect example of a social game.

709
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:18,709
Speaker 1: That is good to get everybody warmed up and to get the kinds of people who don't want to learn a difficult game and balk At playing a game to start playing a game and get really invested in it.

710
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,173
Speaker 0: I think this is also really good.

711
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:21,416
Speaker 0: you find those people.

712
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:22,979
Speaker 0: I know a lot of them who are?

713
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:30,810
Speaker 0: They like to play poker right there in the Texas hold them whatever, but it's hard to get them to play real board games.

714
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,197
Speaker 0: This could be the bridge game.

715
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:41,473
Speaker 0: you can get them into sort of that like flouche culture While they're still playing a poker ish game that the like and you can go straight from flouche culture to brick for wood Culture.

716
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,321
Speaker 0: yeah, you can and that's the bridge.

717
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:45,310
Speaker 0: you can get them over the heap if they're unwilling to display.

718
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,458
Speaker 1: So here's how Sirlin sells it himself.

719
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:48,763
Speaker 1: He just gives you a set of bullet points.

720
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:50,510
Speaker 1: No player elimination.

721
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,115
Speaker 0: Well, I guess you're not permanently eliminated.

722
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:53,837
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

723
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:59,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, no you don't have to fold all the time like you do in human poker.

724
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:04,886
Speaker 0: It is panda poker though seriously as an aside, but you do fold a lot.

725
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:09,590
Speaker 1: folding is if you Play poker with people and you are not a poker person.

726
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:15,228
Speaker 1: My only advice to you is you need to fold about five times more often than you think you do.

727
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:26,359
Speaker 0: last time I played poker for real monies in college I basically just folded whenever I didn't have a hand and didn't fold when I did have a hand and started raising the roof and I just had.

728
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:36,585
Speaker 0: when I lost because I had no hand I lost almost nothing and then when I did have the hand someone usually stayed in and I had the hand so I made mad money and then I won.

729
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:37,450
Speaker 1: quote.

730
00:44:37,832 --> 00:44:41,890
Speaker 1: It's actually fun to play for its own sake when no real money is on the line.

731
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:52,750
Speaker 1: The pandas are laughing and joking the whole way through that is true but The game has to set it as its core rules and you can just play it and it's totally fun.
