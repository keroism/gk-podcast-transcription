1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,751
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 3rd, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:14,320
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk about Paranoia Agent.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,992
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:18,259
Speaker 0: So today I quit IBM.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,394
Speaker 1: Da da da!

6
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:23,314
Speaker 0: I gave them my two to three weeks notice and I'm out of there.

7
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,459
Speaker 0: I get a better job somewhere now.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,285
Speaker 1: Hooray!

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't really say anything outright yet, but I think they're quietly panicking that I'm leaving.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,042
Speaker 1: Oh.

11
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:38,199
Speaker 0: I think they've kind of realized that he kind of does a lot for us that we don't know much about.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,619
Speaker 1: High truck factor is what they say.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,063
Speaker 0: Yep.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,380
Speaker 1: For anyone who doesn't know, truck factor is the how badly the company will be damaged if you were hit by a truck.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,620
Speaker 1: So if I have a low truck factor and I walk out of my work and I get hit by a truck, they don't care.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,077
Speaker 1: A high truck factor is, "Oh shit, Scott got hit by a truck, now the company is

17
00:00:59,117 --> 00:00:59,478
Speaker 1: ruined.".

18
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 0: It seems that a lot of people in IBM have a very high truck factor.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:20,960
Speaker 0: I don't know what, I mean, I really can't go into the details for various reasons, but I really don't know what the company's going to do in five or six years or maybe ten years when all the people with specialized knowledge who are old and don't have anyone to replace them, I don't know, die or retire or quit?

20
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,139
Speaker 1: You get hit by a truck?

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,528
Speaker 1: Yeah.

22
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,098
Speaker 0: Gotta watch out for that truck.

23
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:30,178
Speaker 0: Truck truck truck truck truck truck truck truck.

24
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:33,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about truck another day.

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,660
Speaker 1: In news from my work, I almost did work today, kinda.

26
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,360
Speaker 0: Oh really?

27
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:39,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, really.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,880
Speaker 1: Like there was some measly assignment someone had me do that I finished in like an hour a long time ago.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,316
Speaker 1: And I got an email today like, "Oh my god, you messed

30
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:48,497
Speaker 1: up.".

31
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:54,397
Speaker 1: And then I checked and no, it was actually someone saying I messed up because I didn't do things they never told me to do.

32
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:55,389
Speaker 1: - Uh-huh.

33
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,178
Speaker 1: - That were associated with the first thing.

34
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:09,340
Speaker 1: And also, I was in on some phone call or meeting thing that, whatever, that I really didn't care about at all, but it's like, I'm almost doing work, almost.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,759
Speaker 0: - Are you almost finding a job somewhere else?

36
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:14,679
Speaker 1: - No, I'm gonna start doing that.

37
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,153
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I'll note that I had pretty much no trouble finding a job.

38
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:23,600
Speaker 1: - I'm thinking, if I wanna get a new job, though, I'm gonna at least hold out until after I use all my vacation days.

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,798
Speaker 1: So what I might do is just take the Oticon vacation and then use every vacation day I freaking got and then get new, you know.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,979
Speaker 0: - See, that's the badass part of the job I got now.

41
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:40,260
Speaker 0: I won't get the vacation right away 'cause I'm just starting, but once I get going, I'm gonna get a month of vacation every year to start.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,220
Speaker 1: - Well, I currently have 10 days.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,520
Speaker 1: If I stick with this job, it'll go up to 15.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:52,079
Speaker 1: Hopefully, if I get a new job, I'm gonna demand at least 15 days, and then that's pretty much almost a month 'cause you get the weekends attached.

45
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:56,268
Speaker 0: - Yep, but I mean, I accepted the job, but I have to go down and get a physical and all this stuff.

46
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,240
Speaker 0: 'cause I'm working for a hospital.

47
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,460
Speaker 0: The only thing that can stand in my way now is if I somehow have tuberculosis.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,360
Speaker 1: - What if you have the AIDS from a Mario?

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,840
Speaker 0: - I don't think Mario gave me the AIDS.

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,819
Speaker 1: - It's me and Mario, I made it AIDS.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
Speaker 0: - We're just full of inside jokes tonight.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,160
Speaker 1: - It's not that inside.

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,933
Speaker 1: There was a Photoshop ahead, Dr.

54
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,880
Speaker 1: Mario holding up a pill.

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,220
Speaker 0: - Yes, there was indeed a Photoshop once on a website.

56
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,890
Speaker 1: - And Mario, it was Dr.

57
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:26,736
Speaker 1: Mario holding up a pill, and the text said, "It's a me, Mario, I made it to

58
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:27,319
Speaker 1: AIDS.".

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,700
Speaker 0: - It was a Photoshop Friday on something awful, and I believe the theme was something along the lines of video game characters gone bad.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,920
Speaker 1: - Oh, that was a good one.

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Speaker 0: - It was one of the funniest Photoshop Fridays in the history of the world.

62
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,259
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I agree.

63
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,000
Speaker 0: - I mean, the only thing I've seen that's funnier than that is Lord of the Rings on the go.

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,719
Speaker 1: - No, I think this is slightly better than Lord of the Rings on the go.

65
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,059
Speaker 0: - Lord of the Rings on the go.

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,080
Speaker 1: - Denethor.

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,439
Speaker 0: - He was hit with a four-door blade.

68
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,619
Speaker 1: - All right, all right.

69
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,111
Speaker 0: - Okay.

70
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:53,400
Speaker 0: - Okay.

71
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,000
Speaker 0: - So before we do the real news, we've got the rumorist of crap rumors.

72
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,679
Speaker 0: Scott heard this, I didn't even hear it.

73
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,400
Speaker 1: - Okay, you ready?

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,940
Speaker 0: - This is so off the radar that I heard nothing.

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,620
Speaker 1: - This is such the might be completely bullshit news.

76
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,880
Speaker 1: In fact, probably completely false news.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,399
Speaker 0: - We're only saying something about it because if we don't, and then something gets said tomorrow, we're gonna get crap in the forums from people saying, "Eh, you always know everything.

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,170
Speaker 0: "How come you didn't know

79
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:20,414
Speaker 0: this?".

80
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,920
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, here's proof that if this is true, which it probably isn't, but if this is true, we know shit way before everyone else.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,538
Speaker 1: Plus, remember, we're recording this a good four hours, possibly, before you can download it.

82
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:40,799
Speaker 1: And you're probably downloading this tomorrow, which to us is today.

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,350
Speaker 0: - Nah, there's about 30 or 40 people.

84
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,560
Speaker 0: It seems to be about 37 people who download the episode.

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,179
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but when did they listen to it?

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,259
Speaker 1: That just means they have their computers on with their podcatchers running.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,540
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean they're double-clicking and listening right away.

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,720
Speaker 0: - Though I do also note the aims I get over the course of the night.

89
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,859
Speaker 0: When's the episode gonna be, uh?

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:09,220
Speaker 1: - Yeah, anyway, there was a forum that had a story in it, and that story said that tomorrow, in USA Today, there would be an article.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
Speaker 1: You're already seeing how this is such a bullshit rumor.

92
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,880
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, we're really close-- - A forum about a possible article in tomorrow's newspaper.

93
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:31,519
Speaker 1: So the article would supposedly be about DVDs, official DVDs, of the original Star Wars, with Han shooting first and everything, that are going to be out.

94
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:43,139
Speaker 1: And from what people say is that the DVDs will have episodes four, five, and six in the special edition versions and the original original versions, both on the disc.

95
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,300
Speaker 0: - I'm really curious and dubious.

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,139
Speaker 1: - I'm dubious plus plus.

97
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:50,840
Speaker 1: I'm double plus dubious.

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,859
Speaker 0: - When it comes to our internet news, there are different tiers or levels of the verifiability and reliability of a news source.

99
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,920
Speaker 0: I mean, there's actual news, like Reuters, AP Wire.

100
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,340
Speaker 0: One step before that is like Slashdot--.

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,933
Speaker 1: - Well, no, no, no.

102
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,860
Speaker 1: One step ahead of Reuters is Horse's Mouth.

103
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:14,240
Speaker 1: So if it's a story about Slashdot and you hear it straight from Commander Taco, you don't need AP Wire and Reuters.

104
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,249
Speaker 1: That's Horse's Mouth.

105
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,119
Speaker 1: news is number one.

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,520
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I'm talking about not news like that.

107
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
Speaker 1: - Number two is Reuters AP Wire.

108
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,159
Speaker 0: - Well, no, I'm going back toward the earlier, less reliable news.

109
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,620
Speaker 1: - Oh, see, I'm going from the most reliable away to the least reliable.

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

111
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,419
Speaker 1: - Most reliable is Horse's Mouth news.

112
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:33,760
Speaker 0: - Well, I'm talking about temporarily.

113
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,519
Speaker 0: Horse's Mouth has nothing to do with this.

114
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:36,820
Speaker 0: This is legitimate news.

115
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,980
Speaker 0: AP Wire is like, all right, this happened.

116
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,079
Speaker 0: Before that, there's the other places.

117
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:46,459
Speaker 0: Then it gets to FARC, which is like the early edge, where it's 95% likely to be true, but it's FARC.

118
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,399
Speaker 0: Then beyond that, there's like Drudge.

119
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,179
Speaker 0: Drudge is like, he's right most of the time.

120
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,960
Speaker 0: He breaks the news real early with no details.

121
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:57,779
Speaker 0: He is often wrong.

122
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:02,199
Speaker 0: And before that, there's the story that we just broke.

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:12,060
Speaker 1: (laughing) So this story came from one forum over to another forum, and in that forum-- - Was it deleted from the first forum?

124
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,300
Speaker 1: - It was deleted from the first forum because they said, or from what a guy said, that they were worried about getting nailed on bandwidth.

125
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,126
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

126
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:28,740
Speaker 1: (laughing) - So in the second forum, there was a guy who really is like a senior technical director at Industrial Light and Magic.

127
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,477
Speaker 0: - So sayeth you.

128
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,399
Speaker 1: - So sayeth a lot of people.

129
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,970
Speaker 1: He really is, that's not dubious.

130
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,800
Speaker 0: - Are you sure, is his name Semer Gupta?

131
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,220
Speaker 1: - No, his name is not Semer, he really is.

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,958
Speaker 1: It's not a joke.

133
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,699
Speaker 1: And he said, yeah, it's true.

134
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:42,536
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

135
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:47,920
Speaker 1: If this is true tomorrow, then Rim and Scott got the scoop.

136
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:51,900
Speaker 1: If it's not true tomorrow, Rim and Scott are smart for being all dubious.

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,650
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

138
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,500
Speaker 1: - We win either way.

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,480
Speaker 0: - I put about a 5% chance of this being true in any forum.

140
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:00,671
Speaker 1: - I give it a 5.5% chance.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,460
Speaker 0: - If I roll a 20 on a D20, this is true.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,480
Speaker 1: - There you go.

143
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,313
Speaker 1: So let's get to the news.

144
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:09,200
Speaker 1: that isn't live.

145
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,998
Speaker 1: - The actual news.

146
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,919
Speaker 0: - The actual news.

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,193
Speaker 1: There was a story today on ICV2.

148
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,480
Speaker 0: - I know that instead of saying I'm like so, you just paused really, really long.

149
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,139
Speaker 1: - Actually, I'm pausing because I lost the story.

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,679
Speaker 0: - And what about manga?

151
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,455
Speaker 1: - Yep, oh, I found it.

152
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:37,067
Speaker 1: The size of the manga market in the North American region of the world is between 155 and $180 million of retail money.

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,648
Speaker 1: Now, 180 million divided by $10 per manga is what?

154
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:46,850
Speaker 0: - A lot.

155
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,920
Speaker 1: - That's pretty much how many manga are sold in a year.

156
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,580
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the manga market here is booming.

157
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,860
Speaker 1: - It's growing in double digit percentages.

158
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:58,339
Speaker 1: It's insane.

159
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:00,060
Speaker 0: Absolutely insane.

160
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,119
Speaker 0: - Look at how many manga get onto the best seller lists now.

161
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,740
Speaker 1: - Yep, you look at the top 100 books in the country and you'll see manga there all the time.

162
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:10,120
Speaker 1: Not a lot of manga.

163
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,660
Speaker 0: - But you'll see stuff like, oh, Fruits Basket 4.

164
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,759
Speaker 1: - It's pretty scary.

165
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,359
Speaker 0: - Scary awesome.

166
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,479
Speaker 1: - Scary awesome.

167
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:28,100
Speaker 1: In contrast, Diamond Distributors, who is the sole distributor of comic books to comic book stores and such, they're the only company that distributes comic books.

168
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,700
Speaker 0: - They're the sole distributor of a medium wherein words are randomly bolded for no apparent reason.

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,905
Speaker 1: - Yes, they also distribute other things like manga, but manga is also distributed by other companies to bookstores.

170
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:45,818
Speaker 1: 'cause Diamond doesn't distribute to bookstores, and they distribute toys and t-shirts and all kinds of shit.

171
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:52,439
Speaker 1: Diamond, in the first quarter of a year, made 83 million dollars.

172
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,593
Speaker 1: So, let's see, 83 times four.

173
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,580
Speaker 0: - Not doing so well by comparison.

174
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,849
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and if you subtract the toys and the manga that comes out to like, let's be reasonable and say 240 million.

175
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:17,799
Speaker 1: So 240 million in comics versus 155 in manga, and that's being really conservative and weighting it towards comics.

176
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:22,420
Speaker 0: Also note that comics are growing at what, 1%?

177
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,020
Speaker 1: - Yeah, they're growing at a rate of 1% while the manga is growing at double digit percentages.

178
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,880
Speaker 1: You got like, maybe a year and a half to two years before the manga just completely blows the comics over.

179
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,919
Speaker 0: - Yep, I mean, eventually we're gonna hit the point though-- - Unless the rates change.

180
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,960
Speaker 0: - Where we've already released all the manga that's out.

181
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,160
Speaker 1: - There's just too much manga, you can't release it all.

182
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,999
Speaker 1: There's just no way.

183
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,260
Speaker 0: - But I could see the rate of picking manga up increasing, even though that means also bringing over a lot of crap.

184
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,359
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I could, but who knows?

185
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,600
Speaker 0: - I'm very happy with this trend in general.

186
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,540
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a lot-- - They might flood the market with crap, but all that will do is eliminate a bunch of companies from, like right now there's a whole bunch of manga companies.

187
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:09,440
Speaker 1: If they start flooding the market with crap, what'll just happen is Viz will be the only company left because they seem to be putting out all the good manga.

188
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,900
Speaker 0: - Yeah, with their signature series.

189
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,859
Speaker 1: - Which currently has three manga in it.

190
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,040
Speaker 0: - There'll be more.

191
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,799
Speaker 1: - We'll see, currently I've got all of it.

192
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:31,158
Speaker 0: - I just think it's good news, partly because you always run into those people on the internet who have the opinion that anime and manga is just stupid fad, it'll go away, or it's ruining American whatnot, or they have all sorts of arguments, they hate anime.

193
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,740
Speaker 0: They just hate it and they hate manga.

194
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,438
Speaker 1: - What's wrong with them?

195
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:42,500
Speaker 0: - I don't know, but most of their arguments that, oh, it's just a fad and it's gonna disappear, or it's not actually that popular, really not holding up anymore.

196
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,340
Speaker 1: - No, it's stupid, insane, popular, holy shit.

197
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,589
Speaker 1: $180 million, goddamn.

198
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,879
Speaker 0: - Think about how much manga is in just our house right now, and we don't even have that much.

199
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,690
Speaker 1: - Goddamn.

200
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,638
Speaker 0: - Remember Gabby back at RIT?

201
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,608
Speaker 0: - Goddamn.

202
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,820
Speaker 0: - That was back when manga really wasn't that popular.

203
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,540
Speaker 1: - And now she owns an anime store full of manga.

204
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,556
Speaker 1: - Yeah, god damn it.

205
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:06,359
Speaker 1: - Great.

206
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,520
Speaker 0: - All right, so I got some non-anime news.

207
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:10,928
Speaker 0: - Whoa.

208
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,740
Speaker 0: - Though I guess some anime has been pirated through this, so it could count, and I see some AMVs on it periodically.

209
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,020
Speaker 0: YouTube, as you all know, is fairly awesome in that they give basically free unlimited bandwidth to share movies with people.

210
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,437
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but your movie can't be that long, and there's other rules.

211
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,940
Speaker 0: - Well, yeah, but the rules are kind of bad.

212
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,060
Speaker 1: - And the quality gets diminished when it's converted to Flash.

213
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,860
Speaker 0: - But in general, I mean, it's free, completely free.

214
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,480
Speaker 0: There are no ads, there's no nothing.

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,920
Speaker 0: They have absolutely no revenue stream whatsoever.

216
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,940
Speaker 1: - That's why they're losing money by the fistful.

217
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:46,760
Speaker 0: - They basically only have enough money if you believe, analysts, 11 more months of operation.

218
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,859
Speaker 1: - Probably less than 11 months because they're spending a million on bandwidth, not counting their other costs, so.

219
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I imagine their other costs aren't too much.

220
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,020
Speaker 0: They don't seem to do much work.

221
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,760
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but-- - I mean, they set up a system that is basically self-managed, and they only need a few moderators to go around.

222
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:09,480
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but as the system becomes more popular, they need more hardware, you know, so you have to keep adding computers, and adding computers, and adding computers.

223
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,679
Speaker 1: It's not just bandwidth.

224
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:20,179
Speaker 0: - Well, the thing is they had a lot of plans in place to scale, and recently, for a number of reasons, they've implemented one of those plans, which basically throttles the bandwidth and slows YouTube down a bit.

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,059
Speaker 0: - Great.

226
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:49,439
Speaker 0: - Now, that alone wouldn't have been cause for the massive internet outrage that has spawned today, but in addition to throttling back the bandwidth a bit, they've started really cracking down on copyright, which, honestly, that's really the main reason people use YouTube, is to see things that were funny that were on TV, or videos that were funny that they couldn't see normally, or people are sharing videos that they couldn't share normally.

227
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:53,400
Speaker 0: Much of it runs afoul of copyright, or is in some way obscene or pornographic.

228
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:00,280
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, if you're just looking for videos of some dude who drank a dirty old beer, and then vomited-- - That guy was great.

229
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,119
Speaker 1: - Google Video can take care of that.

230
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:09,336
Speaker 0: - Yeah, YouTube really seems to have a lot of clips from The Simpsons, or a funny bit from Conan O'Brien the other night, stuff like that.

231
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:09,959
Speaker 0: - Yep.

232
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,620
Speaker 0: - They're really cracking down now, and the blogosphere, because no one normal is really rioted yet.

233
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,499
Speaker 1: - No one normal knows that YouTube is.

234
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,960
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but the blogosphere-- - Normal people watch television.

235
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,000
Speaker 0: - I hate that word, but I'm using it anyway, because it's really the only word that defines the type of people I'm talking about.

236
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:36,780
Speaker 0: The people in the blogosphere who are quote, unquote, big in it, are really, really hard on YouTube now, and they're attacking it, and they're saying, "Oh, it's no good," and they're having this sort of internet protest.

237
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,900
Speaker 0: - See, I just wanna say that I don't know what they plan to accomplish.

238
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,858
Speaker 0: YouTube is free.

239
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,360
Speaker 0: They don't, YouTube doesn't owe them anything, and they really have no right to complain.

240
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,220
Speaker 1: - See, what YouTube should have done is they should have let you put porn up there, and charge money to have people see your videos.

241
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,100
Speaker 1: That's how they make money.

242
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
Speaker 0: - Why don't we make that site?

243
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,340
Speaker 1: - What, just a YouTube, and you upload your porn of yourself--.

244
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,140
Speaker 1: - Yep, you have to--.

245
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,199
Speaker 1: - You put a price on it, and then we add a dollar to the price, and we skim a dollar off every single video people pay for, you know.

246
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,858
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we also have a service where we'll verify by the people who put 'em up, you know, legal age and all that.

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,780
Speaker 1: - And we'll verify that, you know, you didn't just steal some porn movie.

248
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we could call it Porn Bay.

249
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:24,776
Speaker 1: - PornTube?

250
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:25,920
Speaker 0: - Pornicious.

251
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:26,740
Speaker 1: - YouPorn?

252
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,419
Speaker 0: - Something Web 2.0-y with the dot US on the end.

253
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:30,744
Speaker 1: - Ooh.

254
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,538
Speaker 0: - Or why don't we get a new UK?

255
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:33,271
Speaker 0: Just like FU.CK.

256
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,699
Speaker 1: - I think it's taken--.

257
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,480
Speaker 0: - I'll bet it's taken by a typo squatter.

258
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,975
Speaker 1: - Yep, FC.UK.

259
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,160
Speaker 1: Anyway.

260
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,679
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's the news about YouTube.

261
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,120
Speaker 0: If you can't tell, for two days in a row we've been really kind of lacking in news we wanted to talk about.

262
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:58,060
Speaker 1: - Yeah, YouTube really should have gone the flicker route, where it's more of a personal storage collection of your stuff thing than a video sharing type of thing.

263
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,960
Speaker 0: - Yeah, because that's a model where you get people hooked on it, and then they're more than willing to pay some small amount of money to get more features.

264
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,419
Speaker 1: - Yeah, like with Flickr I pay $25 a year, and every time I take pictures of shit I just stick 'em in the Flickr bin.

265
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Speaker 1: You know, sure it gets shared sometimes, people go and look at it, but it's not stupid, insane like YouTube.

266
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,480
Speaker 1: Most people go to YouTube to search for funny videos.

267
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,280
Speaker 1: People don't store their home videos on YouTube.

268
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:31,400
Speaker 1: If they made it more like a store your home videos thing than a share videos with the world thing, then it would have done a lot better, I think.

269
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,180
Speaker 0: - Or even both, store your videos and share them.

270
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,359
Speaker 0: As long as you have some sort of revenue stream, that's a great idea.

271
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,276
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's a great idea, except doing it with the video is a lot harder than pictures.

272
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 0: - Well the thing is, also as bandwidth gets cheaper, I mean, YouTube really is something that's gonna flash in the pan and then disappear, because they're whole, they can't sustain themselves.

273
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,560
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I don't want it to disappear because of the entertainment it brings me, but at the same time I want it to disappear because of the entertainment that will bring me.

274
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,879
Speaker 0: - Oh, the internet will explode.

275
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,031
Speaker 1: - Explode.

276
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:07,138
Speaker 1: We never lost something, you know, what if Slashdot died, it would be like, oh my god.

277
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,480
Speaker 0: - Yeah, Meepool died, but it died a slow death.

278
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,280
Speaker 1: - Is it really dead?

279
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,700
Speaker 0: - No, it's still there, but it's dead as far as I'm concerned.

280
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,460
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah, but I mean, I'm talking about something going away, like when Goatsee died.

281
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,398
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that was a sad day.

282
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,980
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so that was something.

283
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,880
Speaker 1: Now this, imagine how much worse it would be if YouTube died or Flickr died.

284
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,200
Speaker 0: - See, it's something people don't really consider these days, I mean, even look at webcomics.

285
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,859
Speaker 0: With the webcomics that are really popular and big now, someday they're not gonna be there anymore.

286
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,679
Speaker 1: - Yeah, people take for granted that every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday there's a Penny Arcade no matter what.

287
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,720
Speaker 1: - One day that won't be the case.

288
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,179
Speaker 1: They're older than I am, they're gonna die before I do.

289
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:45,958
Speaker 0: - I don't know what I'll do.

290
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,417
Speaker 1: - I don't know what I'll do either.

291
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,619
Speaker 0: - I mean, Penny Arcade--.

292
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,979
Speaker 1: - Hopefully I'll be blind or illiterate by then.

293
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,620
Speaker 0: - Illiterate, eh?

294
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,140
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'm so old I can't read, so it won't matter.

295
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,253
Speaker 1: I won't care.

296
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,339
Speaker 0: - No, 'cause you get the grandkids to read it to you.

297
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,260
Speaker 1: - Ah, there you go, shit.

298
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,998
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I guess we'll see what happens.

299
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:11,360
Speaker 0: Speaking of Flickr, our friend James recently uploaded a pile of old pictures of us from various events.

300
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,159
Speaker 1: - Great.

301
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,840
Speaker 0: - I think in the forums I'll link to a few, because some people have asked what we look like, and while there are pictures about in few places, no one seems to really be able to find them easily.

302
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,399
Speaker 1: - You know, you can go to My Flickr.

303
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:26,560
Speaker 1: In fact, there's a link to My Flickr on the left side of frontrowcrew.com, and on my blog.

304
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,839
Speaker 1: There's also a link to my blog on the left side of frontrowcrew.com.

305
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,660
Speaker 0: - And in the Frapper map, I put a picture of myself up with my mustache, even though I don't have that mustache anymore.

306
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,278
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'll take a picture of myself one of these days.

307
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,300
Speaker 1: Sometime.

308
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,978
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but for now, I think I'm gonna link to a bunch of pictures of us.

309
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,960
Speaker 1: - All right, cool.

310
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 0: - Back when I had that beard.

311
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Speaker 1: - I really looked the same as I did always.

312
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,900
Speaker 0: - I looked the same as I looked in high school, except that I've occasionally grown a beard, shaved it off, had a mustache, gotten rid of the mustache.

313
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:56,519
Speaker 0: But other than that, I look the same.

314
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,060
Speaker 1: - I look the same as I did in high school, except my face is a little more darker in the beard area.

315
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,559
Speaker 0: - Eh, you got the little paunch now.

316
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,159
Speaker 1: - I've always had that.

317
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,579
Speaker 1: I don't know what's with you and the paunch.

318
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,900
Speaker 0: - Because you lead a sedentary lifestyle.

319
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,359
Speaker 1: - What's with you and the sedentary lifestyle?

320
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Speaker 0: - I believe you're the one with the sedentary lifestyle.

321
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:17,005
Speaker 1: Mr.

322
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:17,580
Speaker 1: Sedentary.

323
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,437
Speaker 1: - I'm not sedentary.

324
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,148
Speaker 0: - Mr.

325
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:19,620
Speaker 0: Sedentary.

326
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,980
Speaker 1: (laughing) - I'm not that like that guy we just saw on the internet.

327
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,617
Speaker 0: - Ooh, Uribe?

328
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,740
Speaker 1: - Yeah, Uribe.

329
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,620
Speaker 0: - You know, he'll be the news tomorrow if I can't find anything.

330
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,880
Speaker 1: - Wasn't there someone else named Uribe?

331
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,019
Speaker 0: - Yeah, from a movie we saw.

332
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,040
Speaker 0: - Yeah, what movie was it?

333
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,880
Speaker 0: - I don't remember.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,900
Speaker 1: - Oh, oh, oh, oh, the Hitchcock movie, Topaz.

335
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,738
Speaker 1: - Oh, Topaz.

336
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,379
Speaker 1: - Topaz had Uribe in it.

337
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,279
Speaker 0: - That actually wasn't that good a movie.

338
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,139
Speaker 1: - I liked it.

339
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,720
Speaker 0: - It was all right.

340
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,138
Speaker 0: - You suck.

341
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,353
Speaker 0: - It was good, it was just long.

342
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,334
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it was a little bit long.

343
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,840
Speaker 0: - Like it ended, but then it kept going.

344
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,760
Speaker 1: - The real problem, the only thing I had problem with that movie was it was like two movies in one.

345
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,040
Speaker 1: There was like the Cuban movie and the Russian movie.

346
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
Speaker 1: I wanted just one or the other.

347
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,440
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we could do a whole show on that movie if we wanted.

348
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,579
Speaker 1: - Nah, let's not.

349
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,760
Speaker 0: - I could, there's a lot of deep intermeeting there.

350
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaker 1: - Whatever, I'm done.

351
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,339
Speaker 1: Let's go do the things of the day.

352
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,790
Speaker 0: - So it looks like we rolled a 20.

353
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,650
Speaker 1: - Woo hoo, I rolled 20s, bitch.

354
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:28,208
Speaker 0: - This is now, this isn't a thing of the day yet, but it's the second half of the show and we have to interrupt the thing of the day to have a breaking news bit.

355
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,350
Speaker 0: So the Star Wars thing was probably legitimate.

356
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:49,070
Speaker 1: - There is a spot on StarWars.com where we will happily link that says, yeah, they're really gonna put the legitimate episodes four, five, and six out on DVD, along with the enhanced versions of from the special editions.

357
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,469
Speaker 0: - Yeah, THX and all that.

358
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,510
Speaker 1: - Yep, I wish I could just get the THX, but also Han shooting first.

359
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,949
Speaker 1: I like how in this article they have a picture of Han shooting first.

360
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,707
Speaker 0: - They know.

361
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,867
Speaker 1: - They sure do.

362
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:02,630
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

363
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,969
Speaker 0: - So yeah, we got it.

364
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,496
Speaker 0: - Woo hoo.

365
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,130
Speaker 0: - Yeah, as dubious as we were, I think we had the proper amount of dubiousness.

366
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:13,168
Speaker 1: - Yep, however, I got one thing to say about this.

367
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:14,440
Speaker 1: Ooh wee.

368
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,774
Speaker 1: - Ooh wee.

369
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,088
Speaker 1: - Ooh, ooh, ooh, okay.

370
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,820
Speaker 0: - All right, so my thing of the day, other than Star Wars, is a video.

371
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,049
Speaker 0: that, just watch it.

372
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,989
Speaker 0: Just go to my thing of the day and watch the video.

373
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,670
Speaker 1: - Now watch it carefully.

374
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,265
Speaker 1: I watched it two times before I figured out what was going on.

375
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,650
Speaker 0: - Yep, 'cause I watched it and I thought, wow, nothing happened.

376
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,550
Speaker 0: Then I watched it again, nothing happened.

377
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,327
Speaker 0: Then I watched it again.

378
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,669
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, that guy.

379
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,230
Speaker 0: Basically there's a bunch of people stopped at a red light and there's traffic going in the opposite, in the other direction.

380
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:52,910
Speaker 0: And suddenly some guy just runs the red light at high speed through this sea of traffic and gets to the other side and there's no accident or anything.

381
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,610
Speaker 0: He just keeps going.

382
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:57,510
Speaker 1: - The video is accurately named Real Life Frogger.

383
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,150
Speaker 0: - I can't believe that the guy in question is not dead.

384
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,610
Speaker 1: - Maybe he is now, but god damn.

385
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,189
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

386
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,366
Speaker 1: - All right, so my thing of the day.

387
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:16,849
Speaker 1: In the late '50s, there was a Air Force project called Project West Ford.

388
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,110
Speaker 0: - West Ford.

389
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,449
Speaker 1: - West Ford.

390
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:32,540
Speaker 1: The purpose of this project was that the only way at the time to communicate across the world was via undersea cables.

391
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,099
Speaker 1: And they were worried that the Russians or other bad people might cut the cables.

392
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:46,300
Speaker 1: And the only way to communicate across the world if the cables were cut would be by bouncing radio signals off of the ionosphere.

393
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,780
Speaker 1: Now that's unreliable as all hell.

394
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,998
Speaker 1: You can get it to work once in a while, ask a ham radio guy.

395
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,378
Speaker 0: - Yep, every now and then you'll have a ham guy who's sitting there playing around and he'll get a signal from Tokyo.

396
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,156
Speaker 1: - Yeah, he'll be like, "Woo-hoo, I got Australia,

397
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:00,418
Speaker 1: yes!".

398
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:06,080
Speaker 1: They'll get up early in the morning to do ham radio because that's when they can, you know, they're crazy.

399
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,260
Speaker 1: So that's not the most reliable way to do things.

400
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,939
Speaker 1: And they needed reliable, guaranteed communication to the other side of the world.

401
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:15,759
Speaker 1: So they had this crazy idea.

402
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:26,758
Speaker 1: What they would do is they would get a bunch of 1.8 centimeter long, 0.0018 centimeter diameter copper needles.

403
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:33,500
Speaker 1: And these things basically were like these little, little tiny copper needles, like ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

404
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:34,358
Speaker 1: You don't wanna touch them.

405
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:45,000
Speaker 1: And they get a whole shit ton of them and go really, basically make an artificial ionosphere by putting a zillion of these things up in the sky.

406
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:47,799
Speaker 1: And they tried it and it didn't work.

407
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,940
Speaker 0: - That's kind of a crazy, batshit idea.

408
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:57,456
Speaker 1: - It is, like hey, let's fill the sky with fucking a ring of copper needles around the entire earth that we can bounce signals off of.

409
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,059
Speaker 1: Because, you know, the copper needles of exactly this size would, you know, bounce microwave signals really, really well.

410
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,220
Speaker 1: So then they tried it again and it kinda worked.

411
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:13,679
Speaker 1: Like they bounced signals off of it and talked around the other side of the world.

412
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,640
Speaker 1: And then, you know, eventually the copper dissipated and it stopped working.

413
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,580
Speaker 0: - Great, so it was mostly useless.

414
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:30,260
Speaker 1: - Yeah, they even said, hey, maybe we can recover some of the needles to at least get some information about that, 'cause I mean, they really, they put these things like way up in space almost.

415
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,040
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and this was before, you know, space travel.

416
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:42,800
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but then they realized, oh, there are gonna be about two or three needles per like square mile in the Arctic or something.

417
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,900
Speaker 1: It's something insane.

418
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,020
Speaker 1: Like finding any needle would have been like, well, needle in a haystack or a snow pile.

419
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,860
Speaker 1: So there was really no way they were gonna find any of these things.

420
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,179
Speaker 0: - It's an interesting page to read about this kinda crazy program.

421
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,718
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it makes you wonder what kinda crazy programs the government might be doing now.

422
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:04,034
Speaker 1: Or what other crazy programs they did.

423
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:08,620
Speaker 1: that, you know, secret government stuff isn't aliens and shit.

424
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:09,496
Speaker 1: That's all made up.

425
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,439
Speaker 1: Secret government stuff is stuff like this.

426
00:25:11,581 --> 00:25:12,820
Speaker 1: where you go, what the hell?

427
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,040
Speaker 1: You tried that crazy shit with our money?

428
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,719
Speaker 1: What the hell?

429
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,160
Speaker 0: - Yeah, stop taking my money for needles in space.

430
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,400
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but you know, it makes you wonder what other kinda crazy shit they did.

431
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:22,257
Speaker 1: that's similar to this.

432
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:24,458
Speaker 1: And it's real interesting to read about it.

433
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,159
Speaker 1: 'Cause it kinda worked, but all the scientists were like, god damn, what the hell's wrong with you?

434
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,478
Speaker 0: - So without further ado.

435
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,940
Speaker 0: ♪ Ra-ee-ah, ra-ee-ah ♪.

436
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,960
Speaker 1: - All right, you don't have to do that.

437
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,475
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I do.

438
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,799
Speaker 0: - This song is really catchy, I don't know why.

439
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,199
Speaker 1: - It's not that catchy.

440
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:41,400
Speaker 1: It's a little bit catchy.

441
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,539
Speaker 0: - It's stuck in my head right now.

442
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,180
Speaker 1: - Anyway, we're talking about Paranoia Agent.

443
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,060
Speaker 1: Paranoia Agent is an anime that is 13 episodes long.

444
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,219
Speaker 0: - It came out a while ago.

445
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,899
Speaker 1: - It came out a while ago, we just didn't watch it 'til just now.

446
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,020
Speaker 1: We didn't even finish it yet.

447
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,920
Speaker 1: We've seen eight, seven episodes.

448
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,299
Speaker 0: - Yep, seven episodes.

449
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:02,780
Speaker 1: - And it's by Satoshi Kon, who is awesome.

450
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,640
Speaker 0: - Yeah, he's the one from Perfect Blue, Tokyo Godfather's, Millennium Actress.

451
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,879
Speaker 1: - Yeah, he directed all those.

452
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,616
Speaker 1: And if you've seen those, and you realize that that guy directed this also, you go, "Oh, that makes a lot of

453
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:16,859
Speaker 1: sense.".

454
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,940
Speaker 0: - I mean, really, watching Paranoia Agent, there are scenes that are almost straight out of Millennium Actress.

455
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,740
Speaker 1: - There's scenes that are straight out of Millennium Actress, there's scenes out of all his stuff.

456
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,969
Speaker 0: - Well, there's the scene with the one girl fighting the other girl.

457
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:33,040
Speaker 0: that's pretty much the same scene, almost, from Perfect Blue.

458
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,392
Speaker 1: - Yep, it's just, well, it's like, I didn't realize it was the same guy, but as soon as I saw it, I was like, "Oh, shits, yeah, it's the same

459
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:42,775
Speaker 1: guy.".

460
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,599
Speaker 1: And this guy's sorta like a blizzard, you know?

461
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,560
Speaker 1: I mean, blizzard as in the game company.

462
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:58,660
Speaker 1: People always say that every game that Blizzard makes is a good game, and while I don't necessarily like all their games, you gotta admit that all their games are smash hits.

463
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:05,540
Speaker 0: - He also seems to be kinda like the Snatch Guy, in that what he makes is good, but everything he makes is kinda similar.

464
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,620
Speaker 1: - Kinda similar, yeah, but I wouldn't mind him making like 10 more movies so I could watch them.

465
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,800
Speaker 0: - Yeah, now, Paranoia Agent is weird.

466
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,079
Speaker 0: I'll say that right now, it's weird.

467
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,940
Speaker 1: - It definitely changes the mood a lot.

468
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,772
Speaker 1: You know, in one part, it'll be really silly and cute, in another part, it'll be dark and scary, in another part, it'll be way trippy and crazy.

469
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,780
Speaker 0: - Now, I will say that it's probably less obtuse and easier to follow than, say, Lane.

470
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:37,980
Speaker 1: - Definitely.

471
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,856
Speaker 0: - I mean, Lane, the first five episodes were just, "Something weird's happening, "something weird's happening, "something weird's happening, "we're not gonna explain anything, "the power lines are buzzing, oh my

472
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:46,079
Speaker 0: god!".

473
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,018
Speaker 1: - That's the whole show.

474
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,398
Speaker 1: It's not just the first five episodes, this is the whole show.

475
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,700
Speaker 0: - Now, it gets more coherent once you figure out the plot.

476
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:53,757
Speaker 1: - Barely.

477
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,400
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

478
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,940
Speaker 1: - Paranoia Agent is very much more coherent.

479
00:27:58,284 --> 00:27:58,365
Speaker 1: The

480
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:14,116
Speaker 0: thing is, Paranoia Agent, we'll talk about the plot in a minute, but the way I feel as I watch the show, it's just through the first four or five or six or seven episodes, is that it'll start out and you have this idea of what the show is, and they start, you know, characters appear, and you're trying to figure out what's going on.

481
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:24,000
Speaker 0: Every time you start to figure it out, like, "All right, I feel where this show is going," they'll turn everything upside down and the show will go in a completely different direction.

482
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,486
Speaker 0: - Mmm.

483
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,980
Speaker 0: - I mean, there's something that happens at the end of the fourth episode.

484
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,698
Speaker 0: We can't ruin it, we really can't, because it's amazing, but it's the last thing I ever expected to happen in this show.

485
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,820
Speaker 1: - It's not the last thing I expected to happen, but it definitely wasn't expected.

486
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:46,720
Speaker 1: What's interesting about it is that it made it different for most other shows.

487
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,880
Speaker 1: Like, most other shows, you'd be like, "Okay, well that thing is gonna be revealed "at the end of the show, and it's gonna remain a mystery.

488
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,334
Speaker 1: "until then, and blah, blah, blah,

489
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:54,516
Speaker 1: blah.".

490
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,132
Speaker 1: But at the end of episode four, they just totally throw in the curveball, and it's like, "Whoa, dude,

491
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:02,439
Speaker 1: curveball.".

492
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,619
Speaker 0: - Yep, and don't think that that's the only curveball this show's gonna throw at you.

493
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,277
Speaker 1: - Hell no.

494
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:15,920
Speaker 0: - And the show starts out with this girl who is a character designer for a company, and she made a little pink character called a. what, Maromi?

495
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,447
Speaker 1: - Something like that.

496
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:18,139
Speaker 0: - Maromi-chan.

497
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:24,880
Speaker 0: It's a little cute pink thing, and she's walking home, and she's under pressure, you know, she has a deadline to make another cute character.

498
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,500
Speaker 1: - Yeah, 'cause her first character was like this amazing smash hit that swept the nation.

499
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,720
Speaker 1: Everyone loves this character.

500
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,060
Speaker 0: - Like, she's a minor celebrity.

501
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,620
Speaker 1: - And they want her to design another character, because it'll also probably be a smash hit, sweep the nation, make a zillion dollars.

502
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:56,579
Speaker 0: - So she's walking home at night, and she's stressed, and everything's going wrong, and she's kinda creeped out 'cause she sees this weird old lady, and some street lights go out, and then she drops her bag, and all her stuff spills out, and then she cuts her arm while she's trying to pick up one of her sketches from under this car, and it's just a really bad night.

503
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:04,839
Speaker 0: And then, and this is what the, this is, I really didn't expect the show to be about this, except for the fact that someone told me that this is what the show was about.

504
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,940
Speaker 0: Someone in rollerblades with a baseball bat.

505
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,260
Speaker 1: - Golden rollerblades, golden baseball bat.

506
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,339
Speaker 0: - Rolls by and just hits her.

507
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,093
Speaker 1: - Once.

508
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,625
Speaker 1: - Whack.

509
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:18,540
Speaker 1: - And then skates away.

510
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:28,340
Speaker 0: - And then the next thing we know, it's the next day, and she's in the hospital, and there's this news about she was attacked, and the detectives investigating it, and you really don't know what's going on.

511
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,360
Speaker 1: - The detectives are important characters.

512
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:33,759
Speaker 0: - Yes, and one of them really reminds me of Togusa from Ghost in the Shell.

513
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,375
Speaker 1: - Yeah, yeah.

514
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:35,719
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

515
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,620
Speaker 1: - He was my favorite character until something happens.

516
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:42,399
Speaker 0: - Yeah, every character seems to have something weird about them.

517
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:55,140
Speaker 1: - So I don't like, 'cause I always, I can't really identify with the characters who are all weird, I always wanna have the one guy who's smart and isn't fucked up in the head that I can hang on to, like yeah, he's my man.

518
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:12,418
Speaker 1: And when they either take that guy away, or they don't have the guy in the first place, it's really hard to hold on to the show, 'cause I really just want everyone to die, or I want someone to become smart, and I'm just frustrated with all the characters, 'cause all of them could be that guy, but they're

519
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:12,620
Speaker 0: not.

520
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,199
Speaker 0: - Well, I think part of it in this show, Paranoid Agent, is that the show's not rooted anywhere.

521
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,719
Speaker 1: - No, it's not.

522
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:31,559
Speaker 0: - It's rooted around a whole bunch of things, and it never fixes on anything, there's never, like you never feel at ease, like you know how some shows, like you're following the main thing, you're following the main thing, oh, a side bit, oh, a side bit, back to the main thing.

523
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:32,959
Speaker 0: There's no main thing.

524
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Speaker 1: - There's no main thing, there's no side bits, there's just pieces all over the place that are all equal but different.

525
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:47,699
Speaker 0: - And it's not just that for you, because it's that way for the characters too, the investigators who are going around, because obviously more people get attacked by this kid, they start shonen bat, they call him.

526
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:49,700
Speaker 0: - He appears suddenly.

527
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,979
Speaker 1: - I think in a dub he's called Lil Slugger, but I prefer shonen bat.

528
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,317
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there's even a whole thing where the media, like people are talking like, they don't know what to call him.

529
00:31:57,357 --> 00:32:03,239
Speaker 0: yet, once there's this string of attacks, they're like, bat shonen, nah, shonen bat sounds better, and they talk about different names.

530
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:18,120
Speaker 0: But other, I mean, other than the string of attacks, there's absolutely no connection that's real that the detectives can follow, other than that there's, between every victim, there's this really, really weak, flimsy connection.

531
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,140
Speaker 1: - Well, sometimes there's a strong connection between the victims, like the first victim's this girl, who's the second victim?

532
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:28,339
Speaker 0: - The reporter who's following her around, trying to get some goods on her.

533
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,496
Speaker 1: - Right, and then the third victim is--.

534
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:41,418
Speaker 0: - Kinda random, but not totally random, because the third victim, they're unrelated, but then the detectives find a tiny link, and there's always a tiny thread of a link between all the victims.

535
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:50,360
Speaker 1: - And you wonder if it's random, and it's just coincidence, because as a show, they can do something like that, because in a show, you can make anything you want happen.

536
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,138
Speaker 0: - Well, this guy's the master of coincidences, Tokyo Godfathers.

537
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,219
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I know, right?

538
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,560
Speaker 1: The whole show was a, movie was a giant coincidence.

539
00:32:59,703 --> 00:33:09,740
Speaker 1: So you wonder, is it all a coincidence, or is there something to do, and you know that this old man you see right away, and you know there's something up with the old man, but they never tell you what's up with the old man.

540
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,140
Speaker 1: - Yeah, all you know-- - He's like the ninja wearing all white, standing on Homer's front lawn.

541
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,196
Speaker 0: - I wanna see what he was gonna do.

542
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,598
Speaker 1: - He closed the door.

543
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,119
Speaker 1: - Oh, I missed it.

544
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:24,879
Speaker 0: But the old man, it's neat, because there's the first attack, right?

545
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:33,580
Speaker 0: And you see the old man, and he's writing furiously, 'cause he's obviously in a nursing home, but he's outside, and he's writing in the parking lot with chalk on the street.

546
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,839
Speaker 0: This furious, horrible, you can't decipher it, equation kind of thing.

547
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,699
Speaker 0: And he's really working on it hard.

548
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:48,018
Speaker 0: And it gets to the point where he has an equal sign, and then he writes something, and he basically predicted who was going to be attacked by Shonen Bat first.

549
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,779
Speaker 1: - And then he does it again.

550
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,597
Speaker 0: - Yes.

551
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,860
Speaker 1: - So you start to wonder what the hell's up with this old man, and they don't reveal it so easily.

552
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:10,460
Speaker 0: - And it seems like every time the show, the show will be from the perspective of a character, or it'll follow a character, but every character's kinda weird, and you kinda get sucked into their universe, and their worldview.

553
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:19,291
Speaker 0: So when you're following the first girl, everything's depressing and annoying, and people are bothering you, and it's hard to tell what's going on, and it's just really--.

554
00:34:20,202 --> 00:34:31,340
Speaker 1: - Yeah, in the first four episodes, I think, four or five people get hit by Shonen Bat, and the show follows the characters as they lead up to getting hit by Shonen Bat.

555
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,780
Speaker 0: - And it's in the style of the character's mind.

556
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,418
Speaker 0: If one character is sleazy, then the show has this kinda sleazy feel to it.

557
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,219
Speaker 0: And then one guy, or one girl is insane, and the show has an insane feel to it.

558
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,900
Speaker 1: - And then after the fourth episode, something crazy happens, and then the show starts to go with the detectives.

559
00:34:51,100 --> 00:35:01,173
Speaker 1: So I was kinda happy about that, 'cause detectives were all cool, and I figured, hey, all right, so for the first four episodes, they show the Shonen Bat, and then they show the detectives for the rest of the next set.

560
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:06,360
Speaker 1: But no, something weird happens with them too, and then it gets crazy, and then I stop.

561
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,640
Speaker 1: - We didn't have any more episodes.

562
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,439
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we're waiting for the next DVD to come.

563
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,160
Speaker 1: - Yep.

564
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,880
Speaker 0: - I really like the show though.

565
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
Speaker 1: - It's a really good show.

566
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,460
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's an A anime, but it's damn good anime.

567
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,999
Speaker 0: - Well, there's an episode coming up, and we saw the preview for it.

568
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,980
Speaker 1: - It's the next episode, it's episode eight.

569
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,579
Speaker 0: - The next episode has been talked up to by several people.

570
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:33,840
Speaker 0: Emily, a while ago, explained this episode and the concept to me, and it's basically horrible, dark humor, but at the same time, it's hilarious.

571
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:36,839
Speaker 0: About three people who are in a suicide pact.

572
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,960
Speaker 1: - Great, suicide, my favorite subject.

573
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,560
Speaker 0: - I will say that the show does tread in some fairly disturbing waters a few times.

574
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,760
Speaker 1: - It does, even though a lot of those waters are unrealistic.

575
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,660
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

576
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,520
Speaker 1: - Well, some are more unrealistic than others.

577
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:10,659
Speaker 0: - Yes, but you can definitely, there's this one girl, and not to really ruin it, but she is insane, and she has issues, and the whole episode that follows her, you really get this sense of what it's like to not be in control of yourself, or to actually be insane like that.

578
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,259
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the thing is, no one is insane like that.

579
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,320
Speaker 0: - Well, not like that specifically, but there are people who have problems of that magnitude.

580
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,457
Speaker 1: - There are, there are.

581
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:24,419
Speaker 0: - Just, I think the problem they picked for the show was very good to, a very good problem to be shown in an anime.

582
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,099
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

583
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,079
Speaker 0: - It's easy to depict.

584
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,496
Speaker 1: - It is.

585
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:33,799
Speaker 1: I think a lot of the things he decides to do are easy to depict, or he's just really good at depicting things.

586
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:42,079
Speaker 0: - Yeah, plus he often leaves a lot unsaid, like they'll show a little detail that explains something, but they won't call attention to it, they won't say anything about it, you just have to infer.

587
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,440
Speaker 1: - There's a lot of things that I inferred falsely, especially in like the most recent episode.

588
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:49,339
Speaker 1: I said I didn't like again.

589
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,557
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you did.

590
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:53,080
Speaker 0: I pretty much inferred the most recent episode correctly.

591
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:01,660
Speaker 0: It seemed to be obvious to me that the father, not to ruin anything, did what he did to pay, he obviously was selling that to pay for the things he was giving to his family.

592
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:03,540
Speaker 1: - Well that wasn't what I was talking about.

593
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:13,119
Speaker 1: I was talking about like a minor detail in it where I assumed that a person was related to another person when in fact there was another person that I didn't know about.

594
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,704
Speaker 0: - But the show, I see what the show was doing there, - Yeah, it was like.

595
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:18,440
Speaker 1: did they do it on purpose or not?

596
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:19,200
Speaker 1: It's a tough call.

597
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:39,720
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there's basically a point in the episode we just watched where there are two parallel stories going on, like the detectives and an old lady are having a conversation, and at the same time you see this girl walking around, and the scenes keep cutting back and forth between the two, and even though they're in completely different situations, they're completely parallel.

598
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:47,359
Speaker 0: And then it culminates when the two threads kind of, they don't meet at all, but something happens in both stories simultaneously.

599
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,780
Speaker 0: And I'm not sure if it really happened or not.

600
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:54,059
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell if things actually happen or not in this show.

601
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,800
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that's one thing that bothers me.

602
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:10,460
Speaker 1: In shows, usually you can say, okay, that was in a guy's dream, that was just imagery, that actually happened physically, that's just someone's view of what happened and not really what happened.

603
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,899
Speaker 1: You can eventually figure out all of it.

604
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:17,400
Speaker 1: In this show, a lot of stuff is just up in the air and it's slightly bothersome.

605
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,520
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I can see why they're doing that.

606
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,038
Speaker 0: I mean, it works.

607
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,500
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah, it sure does work, but it's also bothersome.

608
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,920
Speaker 0: - The show never gives you an objective perspective.

609
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,356
Speaker 1: There is never-- - And sometimes it does, but not enough of one.

610
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,700
Speaker 0: - Never, there's never a point when it's not from like through some character's eyes or in some character's style.

611
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:42,218
Speaker 0: There's never just like the normal scene where all right, this is the grounded reality, this is the base of the show.

612
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:51,700
Speaker 1: - Because the show doesn't really have a single base, but a lot of things happen that are, this is what's happening, and obviously are literal.

613
00:38:51,900 --> 00:39:05,240
Speaker 0: - But like the little, the one kid who was kind of, they thought he was shown in bad and he was having trouble because of that, that episode was very like grounded reality, but notice how all it did was it kept panning to like all the people in the town talking about the kid.

614
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:13,020
Speaker 0: And it was perfectly normal stuff, but it was still, it just, the show really just focused on the people gossiping because that was the thing that was bothering the kid.

615
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,276
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but it is what physically happened.

616
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:20,759
Speaker 1: as opposed, it was no question about it being metaphorical or only in his head that people were really doing that.

617
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,040
Speaker 0: - Up until the actual shown in batting.

618
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,519
Speaker 1: - Yeah, then it got weird.

619
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,660
Speaker 0: - With the red glow and then you don't know what happened or who did it or why or if it was in his head or what.

620
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,019
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that's the part you don't know.

621
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,520
Speaker 1: But up until then, it's pretty normal.

622
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,000
Speaker 0: - The show really keeps you on edge and it really keeps you guessing.

623
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,259
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'm still guessing.

624
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:40,100
Speaker 1: I'm probably guessing wrong.

625
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,120
Speaker 0: - Now, the opener has a really catchy song.

626
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,180
Speaker 1: - It's not that catchy.

627
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,299
Speaker 0: - It's really catchy to me.

628
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,499
Speaker 1: - All right, it's only slightly catchy to me.

629
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:51,718
Speaker 1: Like I can forget it.

630
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,960
Speaker 0: - Just honestly, I'm not sure what to make of the opener.

631
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:02,957
Speaker 0: I mean, most shows either have a normal standard like this is an opener to a show or they have like a cool, this is like a metaphorical retelling of the show in a minute and 30 seconds, ooh.

632
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:06,740
Speaker 0: Or FMA had the cool opener that changes periodically.

633
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:08,859
Speaker 0: This opener is just kind of weird.

634
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,659
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's like all the characters laughing and like nukes going on.

635
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:17,579
Speaker 1: The imagery in the opener is definitely reminiscent of Satoshi Kon's stuff.

636
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,439
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

637
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,220
Speaker 1: - And it shows you all the characters and it plays this music which is kind of fitting.

638
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Speaker 1: ♪ Ah, yeah, ah, ah ♪.

639
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,220
Speaker 0: - The characters are like, they're just standing there laughing in a kind of disturbing way.

640
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,939
Speaker 1: - It's like they're not disturbing like they're laughing evilly or maniacally.

641
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:49,086
Speaker 1: Like they look like they're genuinely laughing but somehow that's disturbing like very slightly when you put it with the music and the way that they kind of pan through and have these weird backgrounds and-- - Yeah.

642
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:51,086
Speaker 1: Yeah.

643
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:55,440
Speaker 0: - Like I'm really not sure what it is about it but it's just, it's kinda, it's weird.

644
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:57,820
Speaker 0: Watch the show, watch the opener, you'll see what we mean.

645
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,278
Speaker 0: It's hard to describe until you see it.

646
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,278
Speaker 1: - It's the first time in a while we've talked about a show that isn't just, this is porn, don't watch it.

647
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,726
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

648
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:06,997
Speaker 1: - This is crap, don't watch it.

649
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,380
Speaker 0: - Well because numerous people have been giving us crap about why are you only watching crap anime?

650
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,720
Speaker 1: - Well it's 'cause most anime is crap anime and we've just been watching things randomly.

651
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,700
Speaker 0: - Yeah we've got an idea though because we've got a lot of anime lying around.

652
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,640
Speaker 1: - There is a lot of anime on the computer plugged into our television.

653
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:32,299
Speaker 0: - So Scott had this idea where we're gonna go through 'em all real quick, find all the really really bad ones and do one show where we're just like, this anime is crap, it's just boobs.

654
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:33,940
Speaker 0: This anime is crap, it's just a harem show.

655
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,459
Speaker 0: This anime is crap, it has giant robots but no actual plot.

656
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:43,260
Speaker 1: - That way we can free up some hard drive space and simultaneously free up some hard drive space.

657
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:49,379
Speaker 0: 'Cause originally we were keeping it all around so the well of future episodes for Wednesdays would never run out.

658
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,600
Speaker 1: - But we have more than enough for like Infinity Wednesdays.

659
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,780
Speaker 0: - Yeah, seriously.

660
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,859
Speaker 0: I mean just now, we're still working on this.

661
00:41:57,263 --> 00:42:07,300
Speaker 0: but for those of you who know, Jim Vowles, the chair of Otacon, has agreed to an interview with us on Geek Nights and we've been going back and forth and he's told us a lot of cool stuff about Otacon.

662
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:12,680
Speaker 0: but we're still trying to schedule an actual audio interview with him because as you know, he's a busy man.

663
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,259
Speaker 1: - And technically arrange it also.

664
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:20,860
Speaker 0: - Yes, probably with that wireless bridge we, or not wireless, God, the telephony thingy bridge you had before.

665
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,360
Speaker 1: - If it works, we'll see.

666
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,937
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the thing we use for Mike Pfeffer.

667
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,559
Speaker 1: - Yep.

668
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,279
Speaker 0: - AKA Jewish Wolfwood.

669
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:28,520
Speaker 0: AKA anime communist whatever.

670
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,299
Speaker 1: - Whatever.

671
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,200
Speaker 0: - But yeah, I really like Paranoia Agent.

672
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:38,360
Speaker 0: There's enough humor, it's not really a dark show but it has dark moments, it has funny moments.

673
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,659
Speaker 0: The end of episode four, it has one of those awesome yell at the TV moments.

674
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,196
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well it's not yell at the TV isn't grr, it's yell at the TV is like woo, or like whoa, woo hoo.

675
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,820
Speaker 0: - Yeah, if we were watching that show in club.

676
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,058
Speaker 1: - It's a whoa followed by a woo hoo.

677
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,819
Speaker 0: - If we'd watched that show in club, there would have been some yelling and screaming.

678
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,019
Speaker 1: - There sure would have been.

679
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,940
Speaker 0: - Possibly some clapping.

680
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,559
Speaker 1: - Definitely major standing O.

681
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,470
Speaker 0: - And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
