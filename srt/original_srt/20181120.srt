1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,150
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday November 20th 2018.

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,113
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,420
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:17,009
Speaker 1: We are hype for packs unplugged.

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,859
Speaker 1: It's coming up, and it's the second one ever.

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,717
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:36,374
Speaker 1: So one of the things I have to do in the course of my job because I'm like a business manager owner type these days like a product manager is I gotta like go to team dinners like take a bunch of people out to Stuff and like hang out with all you know the people who actually build.

8
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:40,152
Speaker 1: because I don't build anything I just decide what to build and how to build it and when to build it.

9
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,820
Speaker 1: the easy part to it.

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,479
Speaker 1: It's surprising how hard that part is sometimes.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,560
Speaker 1: But so I'm at one of these things and I got a team that pretty cool.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,283
Speaker 1: They're all like really gamer e. so we're talking about like game stuff And it's fun.

13
00:00:52,745 --> 00:01:02,525
Speaker 1: and then at one point someone's like one of my one of my like senior engineers It was real good says something like yeah, I really love Classic console gaming.

14
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:04,691
Speaker 0: uh-huh is he gonna say some PlayStation game?

15
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:10,282
Speaker 1: PlayStation 2 I picked up used GameCube Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:19,719
Speaker 1: so already like I'm already feeling old like you can see like rims feeling of age Escalates rapidly at this point, and I got the original Smash Brothers for it.

17
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,706
Speaker 1: That was the first one right.

18
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:26,531
Speaker 1: there couldn't have been one before that.

19
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:31,305
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah this conversation just made me feel Incredibly old.

20
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:37,587
Speaker 0: so on the internet today, so in these in the Nintendo switch subreddit Everyone's of course like Metroid Prime 4 when's it coming?

21
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,189
Speaker 0: when's it coming?

22
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:42,300
Speaker 0: right, but people have basically been based on no information whatsoever.

23
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:51,387
Speaker 0: Right have basically been in assuming praying begging that Nintendo will re-release all the old Metroid Prime 1 2 3 Which they already did on the Wii.

24
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:56,220
Speaker 0: there was a Metroid Prime trilogy re-release disc But they're hoping for Metroid Prime re-release HD.

25
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:01,117
Speaker 0: They really want this for some reason and I'm like you could probably for less than the cost.

26
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:04,650
Speaker 0: even if they put that out It'll be like 60 bucks for less than the cost of that.

27
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,779
Speaker 0: you could probably go get an old Wii or GameCube and the original discs or that trilogy disc for the Wii.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Speaker 0: Why the fuck do you need this re-released for the switch although?

29
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,347
Speaker 0: I must say again.

30
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,352
Speaker 0: It is really stupid.

31
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:26,740
Speaker 0: if I was the CEO of Nintendo Every single game ever published by Nintendo would be in the e-shop Or there would be some sort of Netflix subscription, and you would just get them all the end

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like

33
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:31,240
Speaker 0: because it's like yeah, you could just go get it, but that's sort of a pain in the ass.

34
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:39,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Nintendo service the problem is Nintendo is incapable of like working In anything other than the Nintendo silo is the problem.

35
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,197
Speaker 1: like they have they're set in their ways.

36
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:42,140
Speaker 1: nothing will ever fix that.

37
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:42,484
Speaker 1: It's just.

38
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:43,618
Speaker 0: I was just buying it.

39
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:48,740
Speaker 1: But I'm increasingly like I've gone to board game nights with like my engineers and co-workers.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,397
Speaker 1: And the thing is these people are not that much younger than me like they're in their late 20s.

41
00:02:53,541 --> 00:03:03,079
Speaker 1: And yet the gulf of like knowledge of the history of games among people who are deeply invested in games is Terrifying to me partly because we got that when we got to RIT.

42
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:06,860
Speaker 0: I grew up with the NES and slightly Atari 2600.

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,448
Speaker 1: I grew up with Atari 2600, 7800, all 16-bit and then even into the.

44
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:10,812
Speaker 0: you know the end of high school.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:31,176
Speaker 0: There was the N64 and such right and then the PlayStation 2 came out while we were in college, so then Even though I was only in school for you know already in the second third year of RIT People that were only one or two years younger came in and they grew up with PlayStation.

46
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,480
Speaker 0: they somehow did not see.

47
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,210
Speaker 0: How did they skip where I saw some Atari 2600?

48
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,640
Speaker 0: How did someone two years younger than me miss ten years?

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,085
Speaker 0: Plus of games?

50
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:43,135
Speaker 1: now that would be fine like I'm not gonna be.

51
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,590
Speaker 1: the old man is like ah kids They don't know shit cuz over.

52
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:49,908
Speaker 0: someone who's like feel that That's wrong for someone who's ten years younger than me.

53
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,537
Speaker 0: I assume that anything older than PlayStation 3.

54
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:52,958
Speaker 0: They don't know.

55
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,099
Speaker 1: yep But what bothers me?

56
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,649
Speaker 1: I guess what bothers me isn't so much that Like people younger than me don't know the things I know.

57
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,492
Speaker 1: cuz that's expected.

58
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,837
Speaker 1: like that's how the world works.

59
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:02,500
Speaker 1: time advances.

60
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:21,640
Speaker 1: What I didn't expect is how rapidly the memory hole like Devours these things because I know a lot about gaming from before the era I played games and yet most people I encounter Literally know nothing about the era before they started gaming even if they are deeply invested in the hobby.

61
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,791
Speaker 0: Well, I think the thing is even people who even just current knowledge.

62
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:26,533
Speaker 0: right.

63
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:33,559
Speaker 0: there seems to be this huge gap between People who read the internet and people who just do a thing.

64
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,101
Speaker 1: well It's weird.

65
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,673
Speaker 0: like there's someone there are people who will go to the store.

66
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,597
Speaker 0: They'll go to GameStop.

67
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:47,131
Speaker 0: They'll buy games They'll take them home and play them and they'll play a lot of games and spend all day playing games and never read a Single video game website or magazine and thus they know nothing.

68
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:55,384
Speaker 0: and whereas I grew up reading Video game magazines basically just ads for video games video game websites So I knew things.

69
00:04:55,805 --> 00:05:01,688
Speaker 1: as I seek out information about things, but the internet II people I meet who are a little younger than us.

70
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,254
Speaker 1: they seek out information about new things But they have never like looked into the shroud of the past like they were did.

71
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:17,604
Speaker 1: I overheard some co-workers last week Debating what the first Final Fantasy game was because they weren't sure Final Fantasy one Weren't.

72
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:20,180
Speaker 1: but they weren't sure because like you just went over there.

73
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,751
Speaker 0: Can they just Google what was the first Final Fantasy game?

74
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:23,253
Speaker 0: because that's like.

75
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:26,747
Speaker 0: what happens to me is I don't spend time like Let me go learn about the past.

76
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,694
Speaker 0: I just if I happen to have a question.

77
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:32,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, I google it and Slowly over time.

78
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:35,335
Speaker 0: I remember where to Google to get a thing and also the old one.

79
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:39,028
Speaker 0: when I remember the actual information I just remember where I saw the information.

80
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:50,313
Speaker 1: when I google something like that the generally there's one of two results either There's an answer and now I know or there isn't a clear answer in which case I just found something amazing that I wanted to like track down and figure out.

81
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,340
Speaker 0: you go set the Final Fantasy people straight.

82
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:55,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I literally like stepped into the conference room.

83
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,367
Speaker 1: It was like hi none of you know me.

84
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:08,087
Speaker 1: the first Final Fantasy was Final Fantasy one And it came out on the Nintendo entertainment system in the Famicom, and I walked away before they could react And I just left them in the room.

85
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,674
Speaker 0: and why don't you be like?

86
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:10,860
Speaker 0: I grew up playing that game.

87
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:11,999
Speaker 0: I sold it back to Funko.

88
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:13,115
Speaker 1: No, no what I actually said?

89
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:25,160
Speaker 1: the words I said were like I hate you guys don't know me but what I said was in my professional expertise And I started to just explain to them the history of Final Fantasy and then I left and it was pretty funny.

90
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,530
Speaker 1: But uh yeah, there is some interesting news.

91
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,406
Speaker 1: so most of you don't seem to follow the world chess Championships.

92
00:06:32,648 --> 00:06:34,440
Speaker 0: no cuz chess is hella boring.

93
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:44,863
Speaker 0: I would rather watch many sports that I hate and call boring than watch chess which I respect chess players more than some of the athletes Like.

94
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:52,931
Speaker 0: I hate fucking curling right and I respect people who play chess more than I respect people who curl I but I would rather watch the curling.

95
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,940
Speaker 0: I'd rather watch curling than I hate fucking.

96
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:57,029
Speaker 1: I'd rather watch curling than chess.

97
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,419
Speaker 1: I would rather watch chess than soccer.

98
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,046
Speaker 0: It depends I.

99
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:07,424
Speaker 1: so I don't watch the chess live cuz I don't care that much No but I had.

100
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:12,804
Speaker 1: I do follow chess because I like to look at the results of games and Step back through.

101
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:13,790
Speaker 1: cuz you get you know this stuff.

102
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,236
Speaker 1: like there's a million chess websites We can look and see like what the fuck happened in this game.

103
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,523
Speaker 0: with commentary I don't.

104
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:28,137
Speaker 0: I pay attention to the developments in the chess world Slightly about as much as I pay attention to developments in the go world or the counter-strike world.

105
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:28,819
Speaker 0: yep, right?

106
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,482
Speaker 0: Where's like?

107
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,759
Speaker 0: ah there's a. there's a thing happening, but like I don't follow it.

108
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,306
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna set the stage here.

109
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:38,924
Speaker 1: the thing that's been happening for the last decade or more Is that and we did.

110
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:51,339
Speaker 1: the funny thing is the reason I'm bringing this up is that I've been saying this in lectures and publicly and professionally for like a goddamn decade and I I am being proven right and I'm very happy about this but It happens to me all the time.

111
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:52,423
Speaker 1: Yeah and I'm.

112
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:56,037
Speaker 1: this one is interesting though because math people are backing up my like.

113
00:07:56,057 --> 00:08:01,740
Speaker 1: I Like I didn't know the math and I just made a lot of assumptions about the math and the math is backing me up.

114
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,098
Speaker 0: But basically you know, it's like guessing about P versus anything.

115
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:09,020
Speaker 1: Yeah So here's the deal chess.

116
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:14,020
Speaker 1: Humans are not competitive in chess and haven't been for a long time.

117
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,597
Speaker 1: No Even shitty a eyes are better than any human can possibly be at chess.

118
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:48,739
Speaker 0: usually when people Commentate chess like I was the one chess I did watch a few years ago the last time I paid slightly more attention the commentators are basically the computer would figure out the move and while they were the best move and while they were waiting for Then they would have the computer generate like other possible moves that would also be good yeah, and like top five moves from the computer and then while the person is still thinking on their turn and then they would use The computer's best moves as you know aid in discussing what move the person was going to make.

119
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,000
Speaker 1: Yep So basically humans like cannot compete in chess against even shitty a eyes.

120
00:08:54,341 --> 00:09:01,420
Speaker 1: So human chess as in terms of strategy has diverged a lot from what the a eyes do because that space is still going.

121
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 1: It's AI versus AI and the chess that they play is fucking weird as shit, right?

122
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,619
Speaker 0: But the a lot of people I think at one I don't know.

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,280
Speaker 0: This is a while ago years ago that I read that this was happening, but that people were basically learning from the AI.

124
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:21,858
Speaker 0: That's part two intentionally trying to play like them as much as they could.

125
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,813
Speaker 1: so Humans who are trying to be good at chess are studying what the AI's are doing.

126
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,257
Speaker 0: But right this year.

127
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:29,120
Speaker 0: That's many-year-old news.

128
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the Predicted outcome of this is that like the attractors in chess?

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,197
Speaker 1: Like if you play randomly what is gonna be the result of your actions over time and like skilled players and all this?

130
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:44,799
Speaker 1: but chess probably devolves into a draw in long and play.

131
00:09:44,819 --> 00:10:05,146
Speaker 1: and My evidence for that is not the current math because I don't know it like I'm not a mathematician that ship sailed But because as I studied chess to write gig nights panels and just my own amusement It seems like most of the rules changes to chess in modern history have been to handle Increasingly complex situations that ended.

132
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:10,220
Speaker 1: draws like draws are the answers right of chess game.

133
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,492
Speaker 0: the only way to fix this is to change the rules of chess itself so that a draw cannot happen and the happen because that would be nothing like chess.

134
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:24,134
Speaker 1: it really looks like Players can force a draw pretty much if they want to which is the endgame of checkers.

135
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,839
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm checkers is proven.

136
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,768
Speaker 1: chess It's not proven seems likely.

137
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:39,270
Speaker 1: so humans can study a eyes but they can basically study what the eyes are doing to be able to take a game where they might lose and Guarantee that they'll draw the game to move on to the next game.

138
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,758
Speaker 0: I wonder right so so far checkers.

139
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,145
Speaker 1: We've proven There's a soft proof.

140
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:44,988
Speaker 1: There's not a hard proof.

141
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,739
Speaker 1: They have not explored every game stage chess looks like it.

142
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,880
Speaker 0: Yes, I wonder is are there any out there any perfect information?

143
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,895
Speaker 0: Games that we've proven like oh, it's a win or a law or anything like that.

144
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,060
Speaker 0: So that way there's a bunch.

145
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:06,875
Speaker 0: Okay, otherwise, they'd be like whoa, maybe all games like this Yeah are draws and we could maybe make a higher level rule.

146
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,260
Speaker 0: So I guess not go.

147
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,960
Speaker 1: I don't think has a draw state at the end.

148
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,568
Speaker 1: Checkers definitely both players.

149
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,680
Speaker 0: Oh, we don't know it's way too far out.

150
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,649
Speaker 0: We probably won't live to see.

151
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,960
Speaker 1: the problem with chess Is that the endgame can get into all these loops where the game will be a draw and there's a like.

152
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,420
Speaker 0: You move your dude back and forth there move my king back and forth.

153
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,223
Speaker 0: I love that.

154
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,267
Speaker 1: so you can tell.

155
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:30,099
Speaker 0: an elegant provision putting a rule for OSHA like OSHI.

156
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,683
Speaker 1: Yeah So they did.

157
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:38,139
Speaker 1: chess has a ton of rules like OSHI to ensure that loops don't happen where a game that's entering a loop state Is a guaranteed draw?

158
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Speaker 1: And I think the only thing human players will be able to do in the future is if they're losing force a draw.

159
00:11:45,041 --> 00:12:00,686
Speaker 1: So the world chess championships that are going right now have had eight crazy epic games that have all ended in draws Mmm, and they can only have four more games that I will bet money will end in draws and after that They're gonna go into sudden death Which will probably end in draws.

160
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,320
Speaker 0: so chess people probably mad at me for this and it's probably hella wrong, right?

161
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to say it anyway, cuz that's how I do.

162
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:08,988
Speaker 0: So I just gonna admit that it's hella wrong to begin with.

163
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:15,458
Speaker 0: right but usually in my experience my very weak experience playing chess Right, which doesn't even rise to the level of high school.

164
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:18,974
Speaker 0: I'm like Not even high school chess club level right?

165
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:20,280
Speaker 0: It's lower level than that.

166
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,706
Speaker 0: It's nerd who knows how to play chess.

167
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,615
Speaker 1: We should play a game of chess against each other.

168
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I won.

169
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:25,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did.

170
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,799
Speaker 1: we should play one now and livestream it.

171
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,858
Speaker 0: The point is is that at my level of I know how to play chess and that's about it.

172
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:43,626
Speaker 0: Most of the draw stalemate end states involve one player moving their king back and forth So it can't be killed and the other player moving and attacking peas back and forth into it like check You can't kill me check.

173
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,108
Speaker 0: You can't kill me.

174
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:52,140
Speaker 0: All right, that's the thing that I have seen personally the most common State event now, I do know that you probably didn't know all the rules for draws.

175
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:54,715
Speaker 0: I have no idea what the rules are, but that's the complex than you think.

176
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,460
Speaker 0: I'm sure they are.

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,080
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is that that's the most common state that I see and that's definitely a draw right?

178
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:09,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, and but in that situation It's like well the other player who's doing who's moving me say Queen back and forth Also has their King like hiding out in the back somewhere, right?

179
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,840
Speaker 0: You know, otherwise they would have lost already, right?

180
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:14,799
Speaker 0: Why don't we define?

181
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,955
Speaker 0: The rules of chess to be like, well look You're the one who's moving your fucking King back and forth.

182
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:23,920
Speaker 0: try not to die And I'm the one who's moving my attacking piece back and forth try to kill.

183
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,525
Speaker 0: Therefore we're gonna define this not as a draw but as I fucking win because you're the one who's hiding and I'm the one who's attacking King back and forth.

184
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:36,156
Speaker 1: doesn't really happen the way you have experienced it in real.

185
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:37,058
Speaker 0: I'm sure it doesn't.

186
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,600
Speaker 0: I press Why I preface this by saying I'm probably stupid.

187
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:56,320
Speaker 0: Please correct me people who know more than me, which is anyone who's played in each s. But we could define we could just by definition just change the rules of chess to define some of the stalemate states Where the person who is more defensively positioned in the stalemate loses.

188
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,365
Speaker 0: So here's the problem.

189
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,952
Speaker 0: is the rule so that no, it's not a stalemate.

190
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,720
Speaker 0: Here's the problems because you're on defense.

191
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,320
Speaker 1: Here's the simplest problem with that because I don't want to get it like this.

192
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,605
Speaker 1: I don't want to make the show about this.

193
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:08,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, the simplest problem is white already has an advantage.

194
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:12,720
Speaker 1: Yep, if you codify those rules you probably turn chess into a white wins game.

195
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,189
Speaker 0: I mean checkers is a first player wins game.

196
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,433
Speaker 1: So no checkers is a force.

197
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:17,477
Speaker 0: I'm a tic-tac-toe.

198
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:18,260
Speaker 0: I said checkers.

199
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, brain had a picture of tic-tac-toe.

200
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:31,758
Speaker 1: That's fine but basically the end result of this is I think the game of chess by the nature of its fundamental rules is Going to be a guaranteed draw game for humans forever.

201
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,874
Speaker 1: good And I said boring game that it'll be a guaranteed draw game for the AI's.

202
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:42,140
Speaker 0: all you people who play chess and are stupid Hella smart and I respect you for being fucking awesome at games.

203
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,797
Speaker 0: Come play real games with us and not stupid fucking chess.

204
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:46,320
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

205
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,624
Speaker 1: You know the go come play some.

206
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:51,015
Speaker 0: you know, they go people gathering and blow the doors off right.

207
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:56,762
Speaker 1: come play with us and go Right, even though you know, we'll have a similar problem in the sense You need to play.

208
00:14:56,802 --> 00:15:01,360
Speaker 0: go come play fucking settlers and kick the shit out of everyone except when the dice go poorly.

209
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:04,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, come play fucking netrunner come play.

210
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:07,567
Speaker 0: Well, you know Some playing your boring ass chess.

211
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:15,640
Speaker 1: the thing about nerd games and we talk about this a lot in our panels Is that come play 1846 if you play trains if you play nerd games?

212
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:25,180
Speaker 1: Like we play them and you treat them seriously like chess the entire Tournament scene devolves within a year or so and the game is solved and you move on to another game.

213
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:26,168
Speaker 0: Come play NFL.

214
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,659
Speaker 0: come be an NFL football coach.

215
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:31,907
Speaker 1: I think the future will be The kind like that's what chess is.

216
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:36,640
Speaker 1: a sport will probably die out in popular like even like chess circles in the long run.

217
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:50,660
Speaker 1: But I think you're gonna see a class of players of games who are the professional board like abstract board gamers that move from game to game to game and when they saw the game To the point of the AI's are better than them and they have like draw state or whatever.

218
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:57,919
Speaker 1: They move on to another game or they do like triathlons of What I try to do, but I get no respect for it.

219
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:02,940
Speaker 0: If I play a boring game like chess, then I get respect, but if I play my nerdy games get no respect.

220
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,400
Speaker 1: The next game is on November 21st, I'm going to on November 22nd see what happened in that game.

221
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 1: I practically guarantee games 9 10 11 and 12 are gonna be draws and then we're gonna go into the Kind of ridiculous and hilarious over time that chest overtime should just be the default mode.

222
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,819
Speaker 1: It's basically just speed chess, right?

223
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:31,236
Speaker 0: Speed chess should be the only chess because if people are playing so perfectly that they can push a draw given all the time to Figure out their moves just give them like 10 seconds per move.

224
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,140
Speaker 0: fucking deal with it.

225
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,447
Speaker 0: You miss a move you lose immediately.

226
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:33,970
Speaker 0: Fuck dude.

227
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:35,880
Speaker 1: You know what the endgame is gonna be like.

228
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,840
Speaker 1: It's basically you get like four minutes total.

229
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:47,612
Speaker 0: And right if we can't test who can make if we both players are equally good at making decisions given a minute We'll see who's equally good at making decisions given five seconds.

230
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,460
Speaker 1: You know, here's the tiebreaker.

231
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,850
Speaker 1: You just they go to another table.

232
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,693
Speaker 1: You got to play.

233
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:53,697
Speaker 1: go against each other now.

234
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:53,999
Speaker 1: Good luck.

235
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,340
Speaker 1: Have fun.

236
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,187
Speaker 0: I hope you know the rules.

237
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:56,256
Speaker 0: just just boxing.

238
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:56,458
Speaker 0: Let's go.

239
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:02,034
Speaker 1: Okay Just boxing is literally what was just suggested in the fall in the chat.

240
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,257
Speaker 0: Just like this is a good sport I'm like, yes.

241
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:11,378
Speaker 1: So in some other news before we get into the bigger news about this about these kinds of games We're gonna do a whole show on this game probably as soon as we play it some more.

242
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,863
Speaker 1: So key Forge has a problem if you're not aware and the problem is talk about this already I don't think so.

243
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:20,214
Speaker 1: Okay, but really briefly there are unfortunately named decks.

244
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,183
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and The.

245
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:25,780
Speaker 1: basically if you get an unfortunately named deck they filtered out all the bad words.

246
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:31,738
Speaker 0: But there could still theoretically be combinations of normal perfectly normal words that result in bad words.

247
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:41,000
Speaker 1: now honestly 99% of the ones that I've seen that are designated bad are in my opinion fucking hilarious.

248
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,800
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and I would pay extra for those decks because they're not tournament legal.

249
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:51,026
Speaker 0: What they're doing is if you have a deck that is banned which you can find out by scanning it into the app Yep, because its name is bad.

250
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,773
Speaker 0: They will give you two decks.

251
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,118
Speaker 0: You just return the bad one.

252
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,904
Speaker 1: Hell no Like.

253
00:17:56,225 --> 00:18:03,720
Speaker 0: but if you're not the erect wang of the forest Playing in tournaments, which I won't then you don't give a shit if your deck is banned or not.

254
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,050
Speaker 0: So if the name is hilarious and not offensive to you Why get the two free decks?

255
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:17,358
Speaker 0: if you got the one awesome hilarious day I want like the the flying boner min of erectile Cove or whatever is gonna come out I would much rather have that deck than the two you're gonna send me with boring names.

256
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:23,420
Speaker 1: Yep And I'm sure there'll be a point in the future where unfortunately named decks will be worth above market price to collectors.

257
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:31,584
Speaker 0: There's already some Stores who are opening the decks like the retailers are buying the game wholesale Opening the decks

258
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:32,246
Speaker 1: sort

259
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:42,240
Speaker 0: of guessing by looking at the deck list like how you know strong the deck is competitively and then Selling them at like an adjusted price that they just randomly decide.

260
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I think this deck is gonna kick some fucking ass.

261
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,460
Speaker 0: I'll try out to see if I can sell it opened for like 70 bucks instead of the normal cover price.

262
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:55,240
Speaker 0: If the name was funny enough like yeah, no, they're not doing it based on the name They're doing it based on the card list which faces outwards.

263
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,325
Speaker 1: Yeah that I wouldn't care about.

264
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:59,120
Speaker 1: but if the name were funny enough that alone would be enough for me to pay extra.

265
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:01,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think You know.

266
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,080
Speaker 0: on the one hand it's like well, I guess you can do that.

267
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,453
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, it would be kind of awesome to see the publisher just be like, well We're not selling any products to your store anymore.

268
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:09,916
Speaker 0: Fuck off.

269
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:12,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I'm ambivalent on that issue.

270
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's sort of like whatever.

271
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what they do.

272
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:15,794
Speaker 0: cuz I'm.

273
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:23,058
Speaker 1: I don't like game retailers Game but there's some news for the other game that we haven't talked about a lot yet on gig nights.

274
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,100
Speaker 0: artifacts All right.

275
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,008
Speaker 0: So artifact if you don't know is valves.

276
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:34,543
Speaker 0: entry into the card game world is the first new valve game since Dota 2 and as we've said Looks really fun Looks great.

277
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:41,960
Speaker 0: It is also designed by Richard Garfield just like key forges and it is a competitive Collectible card game and it's based on dota.

278
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,577
Speaker 0: But actually that's kind of good because it's sort of like hey, there's like three boards.

279
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,100
Speaker 0: You're managing.

280
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,224
Speaker 0: It's really complex.

281
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,072
Speaker 0: It looks like a really fun game.

282
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,140
Speaker 1: I got a little bit of Colonel Blotto going on.

283
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was really hyped to actually play this game until I found out how they were selling the cards.

284
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,792
Speaker 0: We talked about this in geek nights before.

285
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,268
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure They're going to sell you.

286
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,520
Speaker 0: you can get in on the game for 20 bucks Which gets you like a starter set full of stuff which like old magic when I was a kid.

287
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, 20 bucks would get me like a starter deck in a couple boos, right?

288
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,779
Speaker 0: If you want to buy more cards cost $2 a pack, which is slightly more than Hearthstone cards.

289
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:22,540
Speaker 0: Yep The only other way to get more cards is to play the competitive like drafting mode, right?

290
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:36,160
Speaker 0: But where you like have to use tickets to play in a draft and then if you do well in the draft you could then somehow earn more free drafts and More free draft tickets and also some cards, right?

291
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,880
Speaker 0: Or you can buy cards on the secondary market because you can sell cards on the steam marketplace.

292
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,307
Speaker 0: So many copies of a card you can sell them for money.

293
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,414
Speaker 0: that that already.

294
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,440
Speaker 0: and then people can buy cards for money.

295
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,830
Speaker 0: Specific cards that nonsense.

296
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,580
Speaker 1: Well, what is wrong with you?

297
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,704
Speaker 0: So basically I as soon as I saw this news about how the game we monetize is it nope not touching it all not even Gonna bother playing it.

298
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:57,946
Speaker 0: Nope.

299
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:58,167
Speaker 0: Nope.

300
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,619
Speaker 0: Nope, because even Hearthstone is sort of like.

301
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:03,272
Speaker 0: well You pay a few hundred dollars a year and you have all the Hearthstone cards.

302
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:06,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a lot of money but it's and it's.

303
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,964
Speaker 0: it's worse than say the netrunner model because the amount of money you have to pay to guarantee getting all the Cards is variable.

304
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,048
Speaker 1: Artifact looks fun enough.

305
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,640
Speaker 1: I'd pay a hundred bucks a year to just get like all the cards.

306
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,230
Speaker 0: Well, I would pay like but if it was if they could just say hey, you're gonna get all the cards I would pay the $20 to get in.

307
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:35,897
Speaker 0: and if I played it a lot and Kept playing it and got way into it and stopped playing other card games because I was playing artifact all the time Then I would I would pay a monthly fee Like 10 15 bucks a month if I just had every artifact card ever and I could play all I wanted.

308
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:42,972
Speaker 1: Chris Rymer points out In the chat, which I was gonna say in a little bit This is basically the bullshit business model of Magic the Gathering online.

309
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,277
Speaker 1: We all know how well that did.

310
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:49,393
Speaker 0: Well MTG Arena Which is a magic online thing has the same business model as Hearthstone.

311
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:51,680
Speaker 0: basically only it's magic cards and it's a worst game.

312
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,098
Speaker 0: but yeah, it's like.

313
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,107
Speaker 0: Now what's the news?

314
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:58,560
Speaker 0: is that basically the thing that I figured out months ago?

315
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,228
Speaker 0: So I didn't bother with artifact.

316
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:02,238
Speaker 0: the artifact open beta opened up.

317
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:17,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it was a closed beta all these people got in and realized Oh, the only way I can fucking do anything is either spend money to get cards or Get draft tickets, which cost a dollar each because you buy them in packs of five or five bucks.

318
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,950
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I'm just stuck with the same cards.

319
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,660
Speaker 0: I got for my 20 bucks and I never get any other more cards ever.

320
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,280
Speaker 0: I don't get a single extra card without spending money.

321
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:30,860
Speaker 0: It's like going to an arcade where you put a dollar in the machine and you play and you better win three games.

322
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,206
Speaker 1: Meanwhile at least Key Forge.

323
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,640
Speaker 1: I can buy a bunch of decks and just play and I'm good to go.

324
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:37,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's a card.

325
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:39,575
Speaker 0: when you get cardboard for your money.

326
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:41,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, right I guess we'll last.

327
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,854
Speaker 0: you could play Key Forge forever even a hundred years from now.

328
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,180
Speaker 0: I mean your cardboard doesn't disintegrate.

329
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:45,642
Speaker 0: There's a.

330
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:51,566
Speaker 1: there is a world where I could praise valve for trying to do a different monetization model But the reality is one.

331
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,413
Speaker 0: they picked the worst possible one.

332
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:53,714
Speaker 0: I don't.

333
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:55,540
Speaker 0: well, they really wanted to use their marketplace.

334
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the marketplace is the fucking problem, right?

335
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,765
Speaker 1: That is the my whining.

336
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:02,995
Speaker 1: a real money marketplace is like the like.

337
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:05,503
Speaker 1: that is the most harm You can make.

338
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:11,405
Speaker 0: I feel like we should monetization my shitty generic magic clone card game Just like all the rest.

339
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,754
Speaker 0: not even bother trying to make a new or interesting game.

340
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:16,324
Speaker 1: Just like Billy and the snake man, too Yeah, just make a game.

341
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:17,187
Speaker 0: just like hearthstone.

342
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,175
Speaker 0: just like magic just like all the other card games.

343
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:20,420
Speaker 0: you put out dudes and they fight.

344
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:29,673
Speaker 0: Just you know mix it up a tiny amount make it slightly unique and just do the business model of you pay a flat fee And have all the cards and that's the only difference between us and the competition.

345
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:32,970
Speaker 1: Oh Wow, I just looked up Billy versus the snake man.

346
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,804
Speaker 1: Okay, I Guess it's still around.

347
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:36,667
Speaker 1: I don't know.

348
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:36,928
Speaker 1: All right.

349
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:46,795
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm not gonna follow that thread any further because it's time for Things of the day.

350
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:47,640
Speaker 0: what he got All right.

351
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:57,315
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid and I was stuck home from school for whatever reason at 11 a.m Eastern time would be the price is right now and watch that shit no matter what cuz.

352
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,880
Speaker 0: it was really great and headless.

353
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,531
Speaker 1: It's like a fantastic game show.

354
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:05,772
Speaker 0: lots of old people commercials But really great show really entertaining worth your hour while you eat lunch.

355
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:08,219
Speaker 0: feel good to in between playing video games.

356
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,533
Speaker 0: The current host drew Carey not as good as Bob Barker.

357
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:13,240
Speaker 0: Apparently it's been 11 fucking years.

358
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:21,564
Speaker 1: Next you're gonna tell me Craig Kilborn doesn't host the Daily Show anymore, but Still a great show.

359
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:26,097
Speaker 0: still really hasn't changed fundamentally all that much since 1970 whatever.

360
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:35,259
Speaker 0: The only problem is I don't know what anything fucking costs anymore Depends what they put on there, but the problem with the price is right is everything is always MSR P's.

361
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like you're gonna say the price you pay at the store.

362
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,539
Speaker 0: That's way under the actual MSRP.

363
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, they use on the price Or anyway, one of the best parts of the price is right is when they spin the wheel twice of the show.

364
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:50,725
Speaker 0: Does he who gets in the showcase but showcase showdown, but you can also just win money on the fucking wheel You get a dollar.

365
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:53,140
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of people get a dollar on this wheel.

366
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:59,642
Speaker 0: It's basically like a one out of what 20 something It's like.

367
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:00,465
Speaker 0: it's like a one.

368
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:02,192
Speaker 0: it is only like 20 something.

369
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,260
Speaker 0: slots on there right zero five ten twenty.

370
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like twenty one and twenty shot of getting a dollar on there.

371
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,535
Speaker 0: and you know with two spins You can add up to a dollar and win that way also, right?

372
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,605
Speaker 0: So You got to get.

373
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:19,771
Speaker 0: imagine this show has been played five times a week For how many decades?

374
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:22,566
Speaker 1: Yep, so the odds are You can think of.

375
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:26,140
Speaker 0: eventually there's gonna be a situation where all the contestants get a dollar.

376
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,025
Speaker 0: Well, this was a special.

377
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:29,910
Speaker 0: not only did that happen.

378
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,896
Speaker 0: Obviously everyone got a dollar.

379
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:42,238
Speaker 0: This is a special event for the show's anniversary Drew Carey's anniversary or whatever some kind of special event where you could win even more money on the wheel.

380
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:58,889
Speaker 0: and Boy, did they win even more money on the wheel in some, you know crazy luck event Which was again guaranteed to happen because the show's on five days a week with two wheel spinning events per day With six people spinning this 30 times.

381
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,380
Speaker 0: people get to play this wheel spinning game every week forever.

382
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,854
Speaker 0: So it's gonna happen eventually and it did so.

383
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:05,196
Speaker 0: there you go.

384
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:05,820
Speaker 0: You can see it happen.

385
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:12,020
Speaker 0: I still we were talking about before the show, but it's funny that it happened during the special extra prize time.

386
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:15,280
Speaker 1: I just I've wanted my whole life to spin that goddamn way.

387
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:25,180
Speaker 0: It looks like it's kind of heavy right like it has some heft to it But also that it has like, you know It's a well lubricated wheel that keeps going once you get it going with some inertia.

388
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,640
Speaker 1: I remember as a kid I watched an episode where this big dude pulls it down and it just kept spinning and spinning and spinning.

389
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,040
Speaker 0: The point is I just I just really I just I don't care about winning.

390
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,012
Speaker 0: I don't need to be on the show even though that would be fun.

391
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:37,220
Speaker 0: also, right, you know.

392
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,892
Speaker 0: But the only reason I haven't actually haven't been like.

393
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,736
Speaker 0: if this was in New York and not, California I probably would have gone to be in the audience plenty of time.

394
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:49,593
Speaker 0: Hell, yeah But I just want to feel what it feels like to spin the wheel, you know Just let me have a spin just so I can get a feel for it.

395
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,743
Speaker 1: They should bring the wheel Comic-con.

396
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:54,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't care if like you give me money or I'll even give you like a dollar.

397
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,639
Speaker 0: Just let me feel what it feels like to spin the wheel.

398
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:02,560
Speaker 1: I love the fact that even to this day they basically have Drew Carey using a weird like long stick microphone.

399
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,286
Speaker 0: Well, that's the style exactly.

400
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:04,948
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

401
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,454
Speaker 0: The show doesn't change but doesn't need to.

402
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:10,100
Speaker 1: so my thing of the day is It's more of a science II thing.

403
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,320
Speaker 1: But a lot of people have green laser pens or green lasers because green lasers are really cool.

404
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:16,120
Speaker 0: And you know green is the best color.

405
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,483
Speaker 1: Yeah green is the best color.

406
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:21,074
Speaker 1: but y'all know one don't shine lasers in your eye not even red ones.

407
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:26,740
Speaker 0: and two green laser pens are Known to be particularly dangerous much higher frequency than red and blue.

408
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,455
Speaker 0: Well, not necessarily blue but much higher frequency than red.

409
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:38,650
Speaker 1: So a Lot of people because independent of this you can buy a lot of stuff on Amazon these days Anyway, so you can just get.

410
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:44,020
Speaker 0: well you could buy like wood-burning lasers You could buy using craving lasers or all kinds of stuff.

411
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,701
Speaker 1: So the problem here and this video does a really good job of explaining it and it's like really detailed and they show examples and Everything.

412
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:51,363
Speaker 1: but here's the deal.

413
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:57,300
Speaker 1: green laser pens aren't just dangerous because it's green and because it's higher power.

414
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,543
Speaker 0: They're extra dangerous because you can see the same way He's not.

415
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:08,440
Speaker 0: ultraviolet ultraviolet rays are way dangerous because they're high frequency But like low frequency infrared waves aren't gonna hurt you bootleg crap.

416
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:16,917
Speaker 1: Oh green lasers generate the green color in a way It also generates a ton of in for a red radiation.

417
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:17,720
Speaker 0: infrared is just heat.

418
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:20,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hurt you which will burn the hell out of your eye.

419
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:26,873
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah burn Yeah, but it won't cancer you like an ultraviolet or gamma ray or something, but it'll.

420
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:29,340
Speaker 1: basically it'll blind you way bad.

421
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:33,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, so even the red laser will blind you way bad.

422
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,264
Speaker 0: It's well-made.

423
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:38,420
Speaker 1: red lasers and blue lasers tend to not have this additional danger of the umbrellas.

424
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,374
Speaker 0: There's higher frequency than the green laser.

425
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:41,140
Speaker 0: Wouldn't that burn your eye?

426
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,825
Speaker 1: Oh, they don't dead.

427
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:42,796
Speaker 1: They don't have that infrared.

428
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:47,540
Speaker 0: the problem Don't point any laser at any human's eye unless they're a Nazi in which case hold them down.

429
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,079
Speaker 0: Yeah point lasers at both eyes.

430
00:28:49,220 --> 00:29:18,500
Speaker 1: But the problem basically is that the apparent danger of green lasers is way less than the actual danger Because if you buy a cheap green laser the odds are it generates the laser in a way that also generates tons of super dangerous infrared radiation and This the lens that would block that radiation is definitely bootleg and counterfeit Mmm, and this video shows like how to test your green laser pen to see if it's actually outputting a shit ton of infrared radiation.

431
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:21,959
Speaker 0: You just pointed at your hand and if it feels warm, it's not not enough.

432
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:23,603
Speaker 1: Watch the video.

433
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:24,065
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

434
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:27,820
Speaker 1: Okay, every question you've had is answered by this video and it's a good video.

435
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,980
Speaker 1: The video is very good goes into great.

436
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:30,797
Speaker 0: I was watching it.

437
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:39,919
Speaker 0: You know if you have questions while you're watching a video and the video that answers the questions that say I was watching a cooking Video today, so I was making chilaquiles and I was like and I was like, where's the egg?

438
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:43,234
Speaker 0: And then he's like, oh I'm gonna fry an egg and I'm like, hello.

439
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,712
Speaker 0: I said two seconds I'm like, whoa, he still hasn't gotten any egg in there.

440
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,698
Speaker 0: He's like a fry egg now.

441
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:51,872
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment the booklet book is the space Odyssey.

442
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:52,635
Speaker 1: we'll read it soon.

443
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:53,338
Speaker 1: we've been busy.

444
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:58,276
Speaker 1: Yeah packs unplugged we'll talk about in a minute because our whole shows about packs unplugged.

445
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:06,580

00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,500
Speaker 1: So we'll be there doing two pretty good panels.

448
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:14,875
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're just gonna be in tabletop playing games going to panels doing stuff.

00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,067
Speaker 0: Yeah You gotta play games you can.

457
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:36,734
Speaker 1: you only have to be on for it most.

458
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:39,727
Speaker 1: I might be on more without you because I know You tend to not want to be honest many.

459
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:42,280
Speaker 0: I want to get in and play free games and go to your kid.

460
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:48,754
Speaker 1: You will not have to do personally more than four panels Day, I got you think it so at mag fest.

461
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:54,495
Speaker 1: We're gonna do a bunch of panels There's still like the schedules not live yet, obviously TVD, but we will be there.

462
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:55,980
Speaker 1: but it packs south.

463
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,319
Speaker 1: We are going to be doing at least a brand new panel.

464
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,693
Speaker 1: Not rare game mechanics, at least not yet.

465
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:03,820
Speaker 1: That's not on the schedule yet.

466
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:06,855
Speaker 1: Then we were probably doing that one at mag fest, but a new one.

467
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,740
Speaker 1: We haven't talked about at all Nostalgia versus game design.

468
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:14,620
Speaker 1: Okay, you can guess it what that one's gonna be about and you're probably wrong.

469
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:20,859
Speaker 1: We're gonna make a lot of fun of MOBAs along the way and we're gonna talk about how wind jammers isn't actually that good.

470
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:23,707
Speaker 0: But anyway wind jammers out on the switch now.

471
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:27,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, so wind jammers - we'll see how wind jammers - ends up being.

472
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,081
Speaker 0: no It's out.

Speaker 1: I've touched it.

475
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:30,369
Speaker 0: I think is it?

476
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:33,218
Speaker 0: there is definitely a some wind jammers in the e-shop.

477
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:33,700
Speaker 0: I haven't bought.

478
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:37,933
Speaker 1: So Yeah packs unplugged.

479
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:45,178
Speaker 1: we feel Deserves some hype because we've talked we've done geek nights for so long over a decade.

480
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:45,860
Speaker 0: It's sold out yet.

481
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,720
Speaker 0: No, nope that can you are any days sold out?

482
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:53,880
Speaker 1: Nope, we have done such a big convention center and we're using way more space than we did last year.

483
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,440
Speaker 0: This is like in a major area here, right?

484
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,242
Speaker 0: How could you know?

485
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,991
Speaker 0: the east and west are sold out right.

486
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:02,158
Speaker 0: south sort of gets really close to sold out.

487
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:02,600
Speaker 1: almost.

488
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:06,551
Speaker 0: Yep, right, but we can we vote in Philly which for all its awfulness.

489
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:14,938
Speaker 0: maybe people, you know realized awful Philly was yeah But you know as a lot of people living near it and it's like how cut this is a pecs.

490
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,203
Speaker 1: you can just go Aren't you going?

491
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:16,725
Speaker 1: Yep.

492
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,975
Speaker 1: So one we've talked a lot like.

493
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:22,670
Speaker 1: if you want to find our advice I'm like how to go to a con how to go to pack like.

494
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,260
Speaker 1: we've talked about that shit for 13 plus years.

495
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:28,936
Speaker 1: But I feel like it's worth it because we haven't done that kind of stuff in a while.

496
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:29,700
Speaker 1: We feel like we did it.

497
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:37,999
Speaker 1: I feel like it's worth it to hype up packs unplugged and to sort of approach it Like it's a new convention and talk about like it in that sense.

498
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,710
Speaker 1: So let's dive right in first.

499
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,160
Speaker 1: packs unplugged is a pecs.

500
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:49,700
Speaker 1: It has all the accoutrement of our regular packs like a compile of it compared to pecs east or packs west.

501
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:54,756
Speaker 0: The only thing that is not at pecs unplugged are video games and video game companies.

502
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:55,098
Speaker 0: Yep.

503
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:58,144
Speaker 0: It has Concert Megathon.

504
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,830
Speaker 0: it's got acquisitions incorporated.

505
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:01,135
Speaker 1: It has an expo hall.

506
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:02,420
Speaker 0: It has a concert.

507
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:03,768
Speaker 0: I think it does so.

508
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:07,425
Speaker 1: at least it has main events But generally instead of concert.

509
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:15,639
Speaker 1: so far the main events have been like at a regular packs in main theater You'll see like acquisitions incorporated or like the C team like that kind of stuff.

510
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:20,754
Speaker 1: That'll be the main event during the concert slot at pecs unplugged.

511
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:25,860
Speaker 0: It's got a keynote which this year So last year the keynote at pecs unplugged was not very good.

512
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,840
Speaker 0: It was like the CEO of watsy and like it was pretty lame.

513
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,658
Speaker 0: apparently the CEO of watsy is like a marketing guy and he was not the greatest public speaker.

514
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,130
Speaker 0: and Yeah, it was.

515
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,989
Speaker 0: it was disappointing Especially CEO of watsy.

516
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,880
Speaker 0: Well again, they went down to the watsy hole.

517
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:46,360
Speaker 0: But this time it is Jeremy Crawford the lead rules designer of D&D and the game's managing editor.

518
00:33:46,480 --> 00:34:01,840
Speaker 0: So in effect the person who is the boss of D&D at the current time game wise You know in terms of like, you know The actual game rules and stuff in the game as opposed to say someone who's managing like, you know marketing of D&D, right?

519
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so hopefully having an actual game person and not a marketing person to make this much more interesting.

520
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:15,899
Speaker 0: But I still can't deny I'm disappointed that it's another watsy person and another Dude, why can't they go?

521
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:21,080
Speaker 1: Is yeah, right that's who should I call where to come and talk about like fucking weird.

522
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should be the first person.

523
00:34:23,052 --> 00:34:24,340
Speaker 0: that should have been the first one, right?

524
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:36,875
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like I wish they would get people from these smaller more indie table towel community Someone who's broadly famous like the very least you think they would have had the what's-his-name.

525
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,120
Speaker 0: who did the the Thornwood game for them?

526
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,166
Speaker 0: Whatever Thorn watch game?

527
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,112
Speaker 1: or yeah, really?

528
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:42,280
Speaker 1: We need to get like mordenkainen.

529
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:48,339
Speaker 0: But it's like you just get anyone who's from the you know, the not watsy.

530
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:53,800
Speaker 0: There's other you know, even another tabletop game company or even a bad one, right?

531
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,657
Speaker 0: It's like there's a guy who run Rio Grande games with that with the the cowboy hat.

532
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:58,180
Speaker 0: What's his name?

533
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,653
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, someone like that Just basically someone who can tell a bunch of war stories about the game industry.

534
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,159
Speaker 1: that isn't just like marketing for D&D.

535
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,580
Speaker 0: It's like it'd be so easy, but it's like oh they're just going on the watsy hole a second time.

536
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:11,479
Speaker 0: So next year you better get a non watsy person.

537
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,029
Speaker 1: Yep I would recommend if you're going to packs unplugged.

538
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,153
Speaker 0: I'm still going to this keynote.

539
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I go to the keynote every packs.

540
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:18,140
Speaker 1: I will do this forever.

541
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:24,697
Speaker 1: So the person who's in charge of D&D right now in general while the like a lot of the more recent keynotes haven't been that great.

542
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:27,960
Speaker 1: The majority of the keynotes I've been to have been great.

543
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:29,780
Speaker 1: It's just I've been going to a lot of taxes.

544
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,322
Speaker 0: Did you see?

545
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,255
Speaker 0: the D&D just came out with a box set that is.

546
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:37,653
Speaker 0: I assume it's three books Which I assume must be players handbook DMS guide monster manual.

547
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:39,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I assume those are the three books.

548
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:43,392
Speaker 0: I don't know about the other choice They would be but for the new it's obviously for whatever.

549
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,960
Speaker 0: the newest edition is fifth edition, right?

550
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,440
Speaker 0: But they were really nice looking books and a really nice box and I was like man if I played D&D right now.

551
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,525
Speaker 0: Totally buy that dude.

552
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,400
Speaker 1: I see I see those books and I just feel like I need to buy them anyway.

553
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,107
Speaker 0: It's a way.

554
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:56,279
Speaker 0: nice looking box of books

555
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,750
Speaker 1: Also like as much as I look

556
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:59,482
Speaker 0: it up look for like D&D But as

557
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:11,246
Speaker 1: much as I like my indie RPGs with all my d6 is my bag of d6 is Every now and then I have my dice back out and I see my d8s and my d20s And part of my brain is like rim.

558
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,551
Speaker 1: play some fucking D&D.

559
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:13,013
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

560
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:14,458
Speaker 1: You must if you feel it.

561
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:17,167
Speaker 0: It's happening alright, so the next thing it packs unplugged.

562
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:20,807
Speaker 0: that needs hyping is The key Forge which you talked about a little bit.

563
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:24,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically they're going all out with this game.

564
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,011
Speaker 0: There's gonna be like non-stop tournament events.

565
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:33,986
Speaker 0: There's gonna be people selling it people demoing it Right, like they're going all in on this game, which is a game We are obviously somewhat excited for.

566
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:42,780
Speaker 0: so we will definitely be making at least one stop over in the key Forge zone To see what's up probably to just buy the damn game because I order an Amazon and it keeps getting delayed.

567
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,565
Speaker 0: So I might cancel that order and just buy it.

568
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:45,689
Speaker 0: It unplugged.

569
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:49,320
Speaker 1: I doubt I will engage in the tournament scene or serious.

570
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:50,851
Speaker 0: No, no, bye-bye go over there.

571
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:53,346
Speaker 0: I mean literally go Like.

572
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:59,388
Speaker 1: I feel like a bunch of us are gonna play a lot of key for I learned from my netrunner days.

573
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:03,260
Speaker 0: I am NOT going to competitively play any fantasy flight games game.

574
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,383
Speaker 0: I am only going to.

575
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:13,871
Speaker 0: just because this one particular game happens to be published by them, but is not designed by anyone there I'm gonna buy one copy of it and play it with people.

576
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,357
Speaker 0: I know according to the rules.

577
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,139
Speaker 0: We know are right.

578
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:29,300
Speaker 1: Well having played like a little bit like having interacted with the game at PAX West I feel it scratches the itch that has been unscratched since I stopped playing magic in middle school.

579
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,931
Speaker 1: Like that ish has been itching like.

580
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,719
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna pretend I haven't been feeling that ish.

581
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,105
Speaker 0: You should have scratched it with some netrunner.

582
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,355
Speaker 1: Nah, the netrunner didn't scratch it.

583
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,339
Speaker 0: All right, it didn't.

584
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:40,847
Speaker 0: Much better game probably better game.

585
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:44,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is an objectively better game, but it didn't scratch that itch.

586
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:59,609
Speaker 1: I'm still not a hundred percent sure why It has to be cardboard or doesn't scratch it, okay Nah So I feel like that.

587
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:01,019
Speaker 1: we're gonna do that a lot also.

588
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:15,040
Speaker 1: The tournament scene like the general like tabletop tournaments tournament scene at PAX unplugged is way better than the tabletop Tournament scene at regular PAX is because it is a primary part of PAX unplugged, right?

589
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,364
Speaker 0: So regular PAX is.

590
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,492
Speaker 0: there are tabletop tournaments and quite a few.

591
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:23,369
Speaker 0: they're very substantial but at PAX unplugged It's like it's not a part of the tabletop department.

592
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:30,831
Speaker 0: It's its own department the tournament department and it is big-time Big yep, and also a thing to be aware of.

593
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:33,400
Speaker 1: there is a small number of events at PAX unplugged.

594
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:45,479
Speaker 1: You have to sign up for an advance but they are almost entirely either games where you have to do prep in advance like make a Character to bring or make an army of miniatures and bring

595
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:45,620
Speaker 0: it

596
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:52,818
Speaker 1: Or they are tournaments that need a large number of players where they cannot organize the tournament

597
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,300
Speaker 0: at.

598
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:55,507
Speaker 0: They have these like mega tournaments.

599
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:59,120
Speaker 0: What did they actually call them like the PAX championship series or something like that?

600
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:11,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like these giant enormous tournaments and in order to I don't know if you have to register for them in advance But you can register for them in advance And that is simply because they can't have all that met.

601
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,220
Speaker 0: They have tons and tons of seats for these tournaments, and they could not possibly register everyone on you know on site.

602
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:19,604
Speaker 1: Yep, so this it's.

603
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:24,918
Speaker 1: it's a good thing like I as much as I philosophically am opposed to any pre-convention signups for anything.

604
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:30,940
Speaker 1: there are Limited cases of tabletop where it actually makes perfect sense, and I feel like unplugged doing it right.

605
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:38,019
Speaker 1: So if you want to play like the game where you bring a giant army Check and see if that's something you can sign up for in advance.

606
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:44,824
Speaker 0: But yeah most tournaments at PAX the way it works is you show up the day of you don't can't go a day ahead Of time.

607
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,600
Speaker 0: right because most some people have one day badges.

608
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:53,278
Speaker 0: It won't be fair to them and at 10 a.m When pack starts you go to the signup area and you put your name on the sheet if it's not full.

609
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:54,382
Speaker 0: and now you're in That tournament.

610
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:58,116
Speaker 0: you show up at the time you play in the tournament you try to win.

611
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,063
Speaker 0: if you win you get a PAX medal Congratulations.

612
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,460
Speaker 0: some tournaments which are might be run by non packs.

613
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:15,227
Speaker 0: They might be run by vendors or something like that in which case there may be prizes or who-knows-what Or there may be other entry fees But those are not run directly by enforcers.

614
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:24,300
Speaker 0: the main tournaments that are on the schedule unless otherwise noted on there are run by Enforcers and they don't cost anything to enter other than signing up on the piece of paper.

615
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,556
Speaker 1: So the omega-thon at PAX is always like a big deal and it's fun.

616
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:32,338
Speaker 1: like if I'm free I will watch omega-thon rounds because they're really entertaining.

617
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:38,360
Speaker 1: yeah But the omega-thon at PAX unplugged they're still like working out exactly what kinds of games.

618
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:39,859
Speaker 1: They're still like figuring stuff out.

619
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:43,417
Speaker 0: But I want to point out wonder if they will use my tumbling dice suggestion.

620
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:48,032
Speaker 1: tumbling die If X custom tumbling dice if you see tumbling.

621
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,998
Speaker 0: if you see tumbling dice in the final round of the omega-thon You just know that was all me.

622
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:55,959
Speaker 0: I suggested that one and it was heard by people who are unplugged.

623
00:40:56,341 --> 00:41:00,420
Speaker 1: But what I will say is that it is a full-on omega-thon just like any other packs.

624
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:04,660
Speaker 1: It's worth seeing these rounds, but especially the omega-thon finale.

625
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,347
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that at the end of our little hype show.

626
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:13,712
Speaker 1: but round four of the omega-thon at pecs unplugged on Friday is blockus.

627
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,963
Speaker 1: Blockus is a game of goddamn skill Blockus.

628
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:20,146
Speaker 1: I'm really.

629
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,333
Speaker 1: I might like go watch this round like this.

630
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:24,860
Speaker 0: I am personally extremely good at blockus.

631
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:32,413
Speaker 1: I too am extremely good at blockus Scott, and I have both studied Classic opening moves and opening strategies to blockus.

632
00:41:32,734 --> 00:41:36,026
Speaker 0: I usually beat you a blockus though When was the last time we played blockus?

633
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:38,556
Speaker 0: I can remember the last time I played bot blockus.

634
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:39,480
Speaker 0: was that a recent packs?

635
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,307
Speaker 0: I can't remember the last time I lost.

636
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:47,766
Speaker 1: oh so the other problem is four player blockus Joey Jojo Shabbat who could fuck it up?

637
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:49,431
Speaker 1: for me mm-hmm two-player.

638
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:52,480
Speaker 1: blockus is a game of such pure anger.

639
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:55,436
Speaker 1: But this omega-thon is gonna be pretty off the hook.

640
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:58,356
Speaker 0: You got a problem.

641
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:00,883
Speaker 0: So let's.

642
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:04,154
Speaker 0: I want to talk about some panels I saw on the schedule that look really hype.

643
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:09,532
Speaker 0: so the first one is CEO panel discussions publishing trends and avoiding mistakes.

644
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:15,659
Speaker 0: right the panelists are Stephen MacArthur a game lawyer from the MacArthur law firm.

645
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,828
Speaker 0: That's a guy's job game on young lawyer.

646
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,700
Speaker 0: Tim fowers the CEO of fowers games.

647
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:23,693
Speaker 0: Patrick leader owner a creator director of me.

648
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,039
Speaker 1: Stephen MacArthur all right.

649
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,000
Speaker 0: well Are you sure I've met him the director of leader games?

650
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,932
Speaker 0: Which is publishes like a root and all that biz right.

651
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:32,580
Speaker 0: and Scott Gaeta?

652
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,245
Speaker 0: Sorry if I mispronounce your name.

653
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:40,587
Speaker 0: other Scott the president and publisher of renegade game studios Which I've heard of but don't know which games they make.

654
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:43,654
Speaker 0: but that panel looks hella interesting.

655
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:52,400
Speaker 0: that is at Saturday at 10 a.m I'll probably be there And while rim talks about something I will scroll down until I see the next awesome panel.

656
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:53,058
Speaker 1: So what's cool?

657
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,060
Speaker 1: Is that a lot of the panels that involve publishers in general impacts unplug?

658
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,213
Speaker 1: They lean a little more toward the kinds of panels.

659
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:13,477
Speaker 1: I tend to go to it packs dev because the thing is pecs dev is interesting and that Most of the people who want to go to pack like who want to engage in the industry stuff like this our tabletop.

660
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:31,317
Speaker 1: so It's hard for people who are in the tabletop industry to get out to pecs dev because it's really expensive a lot of the tabletop Industries in the East Coast, so I'm seeing a lot of these kinds of panels at pecs unplug that I normally would see it a dev like this CEO panel, and I think that'll be really interesting.

661
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:47,233
Speaker 1: in general I feel like the panel's game at unplugged will be more Specialized to the attendance of pecs unplug because there's a lot more overlap between the people who play Tabletop games and the people who make and publish them than there is in video games.

662
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:55,560
Speaker 0: so Saturday at 1 there is a FFG Key Forge creating the world's first unique deck game panel, but I'm even though I just talked about hype.

663
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,528
Speaker 0: We were for Key Forge.

664
00:43:56,729 --> 00:43:58,080
Speaker 0: I'm kind of meh on this panel.

665
00:43:58,441 --> 00:43:59,004
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go.

666
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:02,980
Speaker 0: maybe I won't because Richard Garfield the designer of Key Forge is not on the panel.

667
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:14,142
Speaker 0: Well, probably not at pecs unplugged either, and it's mostly FFG people And also it's probably mostly gonna be marketing for their game, and maybe not too much good info I don't know.

668
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,011
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll watch that one on Twitch afterwards.

669
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:19,242
Speaker 0: if it's on Twitch, maybe Mmm.

670
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:21,009
Speaker 0: That's a maybe panel, so here's the.

671
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:22,133
Speaker 1: here's how you handle this.

672
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:23,840
Speaker 1: like to be in Pike hype for packs.

673
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,241
Speaker 1: Especially a lot of people go to pecs unplugged because it's kind of in Philly and easy to get to never been to a pecs before.

674
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:35,410
Speaker 1: here is the absolute best way to decide what panels to go to download the guidebook app on your smartphone or whatever.

675
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:42,150
Speaker 1: and Thursday or Wednesday like before you go to the con or maybe Friday morning while you're waiting for the keynote to start.

676
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:43,635
Speaker 1: Just go through the schedule.

677
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:51,986
Speaker 1: start on Friday scroll all the way down go through Saturday go through Sunday Click on any panel where the title looks even remotely interesting.

678
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:52,929
Speaker 0: Oh, here's a panel.

679
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:54,133

Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about all their jobs are cuz just gonna take too long.

684
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:05,327
Speaker 0: It's a mouthful.

685
00:45:06,692 --> 00:45:07,235
Speaker 0: But it's like.

686
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:13,461
Speaker 0: these are like six CEOs CEOs Vps of global brand strategy for game companies.

687
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:13,962
Speaker 0: how come?

688

Speaker 0: none of them is doing the keynote.

689

Speaker 0: Why are they on this panel?

690

00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:10,949
Speaker 0: it cost money.

711
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:21,822
Speaker 1: Uh no, I think there's gonna be so last year to register for it on Friday at 9 a.m Cuz it's gonna fill up obviously But that's the kind of shit that happens at packs unplugged.

712
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:23,467
Speaker 1: that cannot happen at any other pack.

713
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:31,890
Speaker 0: so at every packs I've ever been to that I can remember Reaper miniatures has had a little paint and take booth Right you basically walk up and for free they give you a mini.

714
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:41,382
Speaker 0: There's like two choices like wizard and some space marine And you take one and you go and they just sit down and there's like a few paints And you paint it and I painted space marine.

715
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:42,406
Speaker 0: finally was it.

716
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:43,290
Speaker 0: I think was packed south.

717
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,417
Speaker 0: I did this space marine.

718
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,630
Speaker 0: I finally did it last year at pack south.

719
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so I'd pay.

720
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:50,570
Speaker 1: the problem is we go to so many packs as they.

721
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:54,066
Speaker 0: It was packed south last year after all the years.

722
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:54,870
Speaker 0: I wanted to do it.

723
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,264
Speaker 0: I finally did it and that made me so hype.

724
00:46:57,405 --> 00:47:07,710
Speaker 0: I was like oh, man I totally want to like you know not play any minis miniature games like Warhammer But like buy a tiny amount of paint and a tiny amount of minis and paint a few when I'm bored.

725
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,037
Speaker 0: So I bought the most basic starter set.

726
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:11,783
Speaker 0: that's got like a skeleton in it.

727
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:14,070
Speaker 1: cuz skeletons skeletons are going to paint.

728
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,155
Speaker 1: It's all about inking like.

729
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:16,642
Speaker 1: inking is what makes a skeleton look good,

730
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:29,265
Speaker 0: and I have yet to open Mostly because I it's not that I haven't had a free weekend It's that I haven't I have to find like some sort of material to cover my very expensive tiny table So I don't get paint on it.

731
00:47:30,152 --> 00:47:47,507
Speaker 1: So but basically the way to handle this like I said look through the schedule click on Every panel where the title looks even like minimally interesting and read the description look at the people and if you and Think to yourself answer this one question if I had nothing better to do would I go see this?

732
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:54,202
Speaker 1: the answer is yes Just add it to your scheduling guidebook And then when you're at the con don't worry about going to all those panels.

733
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:58,175
Speaker 1: like you're gonna have your short list of like the three Things y'all really want to go.

734
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:01,750
Speaker 1: see but feel all the right just like like everything Adam all to your schedule.

735
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:08,745
Speaker 1: Anytime you're bored just look at your guidebook and see hey What panel is on like next that I said I might want to go to?

736
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:09,910
Speaker 1: and if you're bored?

737
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,314
Speaker 1: And it's there just go to it.

738
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:18,699
Speaker 1: that is like the best way to maximize your packs because anytime you get downtime You've got like a guaranteed backup thing to go.

739
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:22,290
Speaker 0: do speaking of thorn watch guy, which I remembered his name Mike Selinger.

740
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:28,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, and I said he should do the keynote, but here he is doing a panel Sunday Called.

741
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:30,200
Speaker 0: this sounds like a panel.

742
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:30,682
Speaker 0: I would do.

743
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:31,827
Speaker 0: this is a puzzle.

744
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:33,333
Speaker 0: This is a game He's gonna talk about.

745
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:36,306
Speaker 0: what's a puzzle and what's a game what the difference is?

746
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:37,511
Speaker 1: I have said I have.

747
00:48:37,893 --> 00:48:43,674
Speaker 1: not only have I seen him give basically that talk at pecs dev multiple times like a talk like it like he's Good talks.

748
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:50,504
Speaker 1: They're good panels, but - I Had a long conversation where he drunkenly explained this in detail to me.

749
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:50,946
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

750
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:52,130
Speaker 0: It'll be a good panel.

751
00:48:52,553 --> 00:48:53,278
Speaker 0: I'm sure it will be.

752
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:55,532
Speaker 1: yeah cuz we uh Think about this.

753
00:48:55,633 --> 00:49:01,090
Speaker 1: a lot of these panels are the kinds of things that you'll hear us arguing about in panels.

754
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:08,110
Speaker 1: Just people smarter than us who are deeper in the industry will argue about it with more information than we have.

755
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:15,924
Speaker 0: Also, I just want to point out you know if you are the kind of person Which is a lot of people who really want to play some RPGs.

756
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:19,860
Speaker 0: usually a lot of people are like hey I want to play D&D, but I never played a D&D before.

757
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:23,977
Speaker 0: right pack some plugs Is probably the place for you to go.

758
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:33,330
Speaker 0: it's gonna be a lot more accessible than one of those tiny RPG cons in the you know like that's you know usually like a uber con or something if that still exists.

759
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:38,008
Speaker 0: And it's probably gonna be a lot less crowded than trying to play D&D like a PAX East.

760
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:40,319
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, this basically if you look at the schedule.

761
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:50,784
Speaker 0: There's like D&D Adventurers League Pathfinder Society all this stuff is basically happening Constantly even other RPGs that are lesser-known that you might be more interested in.

762
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:52,248
Speaker 0: yeah all over the fuck is.

763
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:53,893
Speaker 0: I see some Star Wars RPG.

764
00:49:54,053 --> 00:50:01,062
Speaker 0: if you want to get your RPG on the danger room LARP by mystic realms whatever the hell that is sound Maybe it's based on the x-men danger room.

765
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:01,585
Speaker 0: I don't know.

766
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:09,710
Speaker 1: I just want to point out Sunday morning if you want to win a PAX tournament guys there is a 16 player single elimination.

767
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:11,003
Speaker 1: Connect for tournament.

768
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:13,619
Speaker 1: oh, baby Or is a sold fucking game.

769
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,065
Speaker 0: if you go you can.

770
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:16,190
Speaker 0: you can start right now?

771
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:21,050
Speaker 0: Go online and learn how to be perfect at connect for it won't take you very long.

772
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:23,010
Speaker 0: Practice it a few times against your friends.

773
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,561
Speaker 0: yep practice by playing it online against an AI.

774
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:26,767
Speaker 1: learn the backups.

775
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:39,390
Speaker 1: learn the Guaranteed strat and learn the backup strat if you're the wrong player right and then basically you will Probably face in the final someone else who did the same thing yep, and then it'll come down to do you go first or second?

776
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:44,775
Speaker 0: Yep, but anyway, that's that's an easy easy win of a PAX medal yep But there's.

777
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:45,942
Speaker 1: this is a good schedule like it.

778
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:47,130
Speaker 1: There's good stuff in here.

779
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:54,369
Speaker 0: I also want to point out again also if none of those RPGs are interesting to you Or maybe they're not at a good time on your schedule.

780
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,240
Speaker 0: RPGs games on demand is gonna be there.

781
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:03,242
Speaker 0: what this is if you don't know what they're at many Pax's as well as other conventions is a little booth or an area.

782
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:08,088
Speaker 0: you go there with your friends or maybe you meet up with some strangers there who knows?

783
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:10,554
Speaker 0: and There's RPGs there.

784
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:18,310
Speaker 0: there are GM's just waiting for players and as soon as I did this one year at PAX West I GM like three or four RPGs in the games on demand area.

785
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:20,665
Speaker 0: Oh, and you just wait when I was a GM.

786
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:25,165
Speaker 0: I just went there I waited I put up these little cards, and it was like a menu.

787
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:33,957
Speaker 0: players came up They looked at the menu And they were like they wanted to play an RPG right then there and now as soon as there were enough people I brought them over to a table.

788
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,390
Speaker 0: I ran a one-shot RPG session.

789
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:49,281
Speaker 0: I set them on their way and even though I thought only maybe one and a half of those sessions was good I got excellent feedback in all the sessions, so if you want to play RPG Telling you packs unplugged you cannot miss.

790
00:51:49,763 --> 00:51:50,466
Speaker 0: This is your chance.

791
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:52,774
Speaker 0: all those you're like oh, man I never get to play RPG.

792
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:54,800
Speaker 0: I watch RPG on Twitch.

793
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:58,050
Speaker 0: I watch acquisitions incorporated, but I got no friends.

794
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't.

795
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:02,219
Speaker 0: I have friends But I can't get them together because they're all busy.

796
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,579
Speaker 1: all the people who are obsessed with the C team are Here in the same building with you.

797
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:15,044
Speaker 0: you can go to packs unplugged for three days And if you really want to you could probably play two or three RPG a day if you really dedicated all your time to that and nothing else.

798
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,728
Speaker 0: and that is not a bad way to spend the packs unplugged yep.

799
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:27,341
Speaker 1: So in terms of to like LFG like all packs is have like a looking for game area and tabletop packs unplugged has a fucking looking for game area.

800
00:52:27,382 --> 00:52:33,060
Speaker 1: like if you want to no matter what weird like Train game nonsense you want to play.

801
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:38,743
Speaker 1: if you LFG it unplugged You're all practically guaranteed to find other people who will play this game with you.

802
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:45,308
Speaker 0: and even if those people are That guy it's packs, so they're not allowed to be that guy.

803
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:50,434
Speaker 0: yep You can always get some enforcers and be like yo We got a that guy over here And they'll get taken care of.

804
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:51,618
Speaker 0: you can be rest assured.

805
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:55,230
Speaker 0: the worst you'll have to deal with is slightly.

806
00:52:56,435 --> 00:53:01,080
Speaker 0: And let me tell you wants to play shit geek but won't be bad because it's packs unplugged.

807
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,426
Speaker 1: is the tabletop focused one?

808
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:12,477
Speaker 1: the Enforcers at packs unplugged even more so than other packs is are on top of that guy Like they are crack.

809
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:15,186
Speaker 1: They're a crack team to make sure that guy doesn't.

810
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:26,056
Speaker 1: that guy all over you Let's see there's a kids room in a family room like Sunday is a kids day like you can bring your kid if they're under 12 For free on Sunday.

811
00:53:26,256 --> 00:53:31,814
Speaker 1: Oh, baby, and there is a big area because pax's are Family-friendly.

812
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:36,770
Speaker 1: if you're a family that says fuck casually like that's how pax is like it's family-friendly.

813
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:41,165
Speaker 1: But it has to be this like cool dad that lets the kids say fuck when they're not at school.

814
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:43,950
Speaker 1: There is a specifically

815
00:53:45,275 --> 00:53:55,810
Speaker 0: I think there was a dad who had like it let his kid that they're listening to geek nights in the car And he was like he's like yeah I just got to tell my kid not to say words that you're saying and I'm like I don't think you've learned the lesson of geek nights.

816
00:53:55,991 --> 00:54:06,030
Speaker 0: You should have a cool kid who says fuck like he's from, New York But the kid who's smart enough to not say fuck in front of his middle school teacher or to say fuck you middle school teacher Just a fucking word.

817
00:54:07,292 --> 00:54:12,590
Speaker 1: But there is a family room that has miniature painting and games and is the fuck like the fuck free zone.

818
00:54:13,152 --> 00:54:17,365
Speaker 1: So like pegs unplugged is more family and kid friendly than a general packs.

819
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:18,930
Speaker 1: that is like worth noting.

820
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:20,142
Speaker 1: It's kind of a. it's a cool thing.

821
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:20,849
Speaker 1: I'm glad they do it.

822
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,889
Speaker 1: The pain like all the pack stuff like the pin trading is there's just there.

823
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,058
Speaker 1: Tabletop is so big.

824
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:41,129
Speaker 1: there's like oh, so if you haven't been to a packs recently There's a new thing in tabletop called first look mm-hmm Started at last packs unplugged But it has reappeared at every packs all year and it'll be at every packs forever.

825
00:54:41,149 --> 00:54:41,771
Speaker 0: first Look.

826
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:49,649
Speaker 1: the deal if you don't know is it's not like regular tabletop where there's like an area where everyone plays Carcassonne Not an area where you play whatever.

827
00:54:50,172 --> 00:55:00,690
Speaker 0: it's an area where there are games already set up with the rules sitting there and Enforcers who have tried to spend as much time as they could learning the rules so that they could teach anyone who walks up.

828
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:04,950
Speaker 1: So you can go into this area see a game that is not out yet or not out.

829
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:20,330
Speaker 0: We had expert enforcers go to S in BGG con and all these other board game events that are conveniently scheduled right before packs unplugged To collect the newest and hottest board games that are unavailable still in the United States or hard to obtain.

830
00:55:20,772 --> 00:55:25,049
Speaker 0: Bring them here to teach them to you, so you can have the first look at them.

831
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:42,870
Speaker 1: It's really great and amazing to just sit down at some brand new game and have an enforcer Expertly teach you and a bunch of other people how to play it and then be available answer questions While you play it and when you're done playing it walk away from the table and the game is set up for the next group

832
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:43,271
Speaker 0: of people.

833
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:50,978
Speaker 0: the only thing I can tell you though is that the first look area at packs unplugged as hard as there's a line is Very crowded because a lot of people.

834
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,063
Speaker 0: so the real secret.

835
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:53,630
Speaker 0: you got to go to the first look area.

836
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,630
Speaker 0: I packed south and literally any other packs, but pack south it is the least crowded.

837
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:00,713
Speaker 1: Yeah pack south is like the Secret packs on.

838
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:00,994
Speaker 1: you'll

839
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:17,627
Speaker 0: get the same exact first look area and the same exact tabletop library that was at packs unplugged But they'll be fucking like almost no one else playing games there But the same enforcers learning and teaching the same games the same everything and now you can play those games Just to your heart's content without having to wait whereas it packs unplugged.

840
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:22,068
Speaker 0: you'd be like oh, man I really want to play that that meeple circus that was in the first look last year.

841
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:22,410
Speaker 0: right yep.

842
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:24,136
Speaker 0: And meanwhile someone's playing it.

843
00:56:24,156 --> 00:56:27,930
Speaker 0: so you walk away and come back someone else is playing it walk away coming someone's playing it packs unplugged.

844
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,422
Speaker 0: It's just sitting there waiting for you to come and enjoy the circus.

845
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:38,970
Speaker 1: and one last thing that's interesting about packs unplugged Is that you know Mike and Jerry are both like around and other packs is kind of equally and they hide and whatever.

846
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:49,350
Speaker 1: But if your packs unplugged is kind of like the Jerry attacks Like Mike will be doing like a storm watch stuff and Jerry's just like wandering around all the time like playing games with people.

847
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,092
Speaker 1: He's more accessible than he is at other packs is.

848
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:59,194
Speaker 1: so if your jam is to like be adjacent to that dude while you play a game like unplugged is the one to go to if you care about that sort of thing.

849
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:13,570
Speaker 1: and last and least If you are a fan of us already You don't need to go to our 40 tabletop games You must play panel because one it's gonna be on YouTube and two it's 80% the same as the one that's already on YouTube.

850
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:17,803
Speaker 1: We're doing it at packs unplugged because one it's gonna be a live streaming.

851
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:29,962
Speaker 1: because that kind of panel like gaming comms that aren't packs don't really have good panels and tabletop gaming comms that aren't packs Really don't have the concept of panels by and large.

852
00:57:30,504 --> 00:57:32,069
Speaker 1: so we're doing this for people who aren't you.

853
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,741
Speaker 1: But it's probably worth going to our learning when.

854
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:46,741
Speaker 1: Puerto Rico if you don't know how to play Puerto Rico Because we're literally gonna be in the room for a couple hours like helping you all play Puerto Rico Like not just the panel even if you just watch it on YouTube It's not the same.

855
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:57,015
Speaker 1: if you're in the room You can like ask us what to do in a situation right there and we'll be like Pick the captain because it'll totally fuck over that guy and this guy is not gonna beat you Etc.

856
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,365
Speaker 1: like that kind of stuff will happen.

857
00:57:58,547 --> 00:57:58,788
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

858
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:03,290
Speaker 1: And if you see us like, you know what other packs is people like, oh, hey, I want to play.

859
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,899
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this packs of bug just really soon.

860
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:06,890
Speaker 0: We should probably work on that parent Rico panel.

861
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:09,520
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish it this like over Thanksgiving.

862
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:09,982
Speaker 1: cuz I'm not going.

863
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,328
Speaker 1: I'm not doing shit for Thanksgiving.

864
00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:11,870
Speaker 1: I'm staying home.

865
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:14,825
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to like finish the panel on Thursday.

866
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:15,770
Speaker 0: You don't want to go to New Jersey.

867
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:17,402
Speaker 1: I could do you wanna.

868
00:58:17,442 --> 00:58:18,026
Speaker 1: I could do that?

869
00:58:18,188 --> 00:58:18,490
Speaker 0: I don't know.

870
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:20,557
Speaker 0: See if it's a. if it's possible.

871
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:21,180
Speaker 1: see if it's possible.

872
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,390
Speaker 1: Emily we're gonna like a film screening but this in the morning.

873
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:24,554
Speaker 1: So it wouldn't really impact us.

874
00:58:24,574 --> 00:58:25,436
Speaker 1: We have no plans.

875
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:26,018
Speaker 0: Hmm.

Speaker 1: This is uh, this is my like don't go anywhere for the holidays here.

877
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:31,404
Speaker 1: So I'm just I'm making no plans.

878
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:32,090
Speaker 1: I'm just relaxing.

879
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:42,357
Speaker 0: The thing is if you go to New Jersey And we take the train there and then I don't know if a car will be big enough to put Everyone in to take us to yeah The the destination

880
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:44,769
Speaker 1: might just have to get me to Q Gardens and I'll deal with the.

881
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:45,050
Speaker 1: I don't know.

882
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:47,824
Speaker 1: I'm working on Friday to save vacation day.

883
00:58:47,884 --> 00:58:50,775
Speaker 0: So oh, I'm Going back.

884
00:58:50,896 --> 00:58:52,426
Speaker 0: It's nothing you have to get home somehow.

885
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:56,343
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I'm just gonna go back to Connecticut because I'm not working.

886
00:58:56,444 --> 00:58:57,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll figure it out.

887
00:58:57,026 --> 00:58:57,388
Speaker 1: worst case.

888
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:57,950
Speaker 1: We'll just stay home.

889
00:58:58,091 --> 00:58:58,842
Speaker 1: I'll finish the panel.

890
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:00,796
Speaker 1: Mmm I had to figure out.

891
00:59:01,118 --> 00:59:08,410
Speaker 1: cuz I have like the three-player strategies I had to do a little bit of work to figure out the right advice for five-player Puerto Rico.

892
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:10,901
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm just mostly gonna focus on the advice.

893
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:11,363
Speaker 0: That's good.

894
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:17,150
Speaker 0: No matter how many players you have Use the captain when everyone else has to dump all their barrels in the ocean.

895
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:17,993
Speaker 1: Here's an example.

896
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,162
Speaker 1: like three-player Puerto Rico never buy a fucking warehouse.

897
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:23,610
Speaker 1: Like what a waste of goddamn doubloons.

898
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:27,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, five-player Puerto Rico that small warehouse is real good.

899
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:34,210
Speaker 0: Yep, small warehouse plus war main the main strategy is you want to take have to take as few actions as possible, right?

900
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:40,459
Speaker 0: Like if I have to go mayor and then a bunch of nothing happens and then I have to go Alright now I'll do build it right.

901
00:59:40,499 --> 00:59:42,368
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if I do well, I guess we build her.

902
00:59:42,388 --> 00:59:43,836
Speaker 1: then mayor You want everyone you want to line it up?

903
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:51,803
Speaker 0: So everyone else is taking the actions you need in the order you need so that on your turn You're like you're getting turns ahead of other people.

904
00:59:51,943 --> 00:59:57,397
Speaker 1: Yep, like race for the galaxy You can't just be going Craft x2 craft x2.

905
00:59:57,618 --> 01:00:01,629
Speaker 1: you want to go x2 x2 x2 and trick some other schmuck into going craft craft craft.

906
01:00:01,649 --> 01:00:04,510
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah, this is a fun panel.

907
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,290
Speaker 1: This is gonna be real like not everything is gonna make it to YouTube from that one.
