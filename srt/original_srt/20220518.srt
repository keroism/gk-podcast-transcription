1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,377
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 18th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:09,638
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:13,386
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,874
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:19,749
Speaker 1: Tonight, we talk about voice acting and voice actors and that whole space.

6
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:22,708
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,930
Speaker 1: So tonight begins the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the New York Rangers.

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,450
Speaker 0: Well, we're gonna lose, almost definitely.

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,770
Speaker 1: Scott is obligated to say that for fear of angering various gods, I guess.

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:38,654
Speaker 0: Well, no.

11
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:39,946
Speaker 0: In this case, I actually don't.

12
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,866
Speaker 0: If you watched, I saw all three or four games.

13
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:44,810
Speaker 0: I don't remember how many.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,925
Speaker 0: We played against this team this season.

15
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:47,509
Speaker 0: It was four.

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,449
Speaker 0: Not crushed like every time.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,210
Speaker 0: The one game we won was because Georgia had some amazing shutout.

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,390
Speaker 0: The other three games, they completely dominated us.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,123
Speaker 0: I saw two of those games in person.

20
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:58,930
Speaker 0: We just got crushed.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:00:59,398
Speaker 1: Yep.

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,950
Speaker 0: They are the rock to our scissors.

23
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:03,674
Speaker 0: But you know what?

24
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:04,397
Speaker 0: I don't care.

25
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,210
Speaker 0: I am happy to have just made it this far.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,830
Speaker 1: I mean, the game seven that we just watched, what was the prize?

27
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:11,950
Speaker 1: At least four more hockey games.

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,970
Speaker 0: That was, yeah, but two of them at home, right?

29
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,332
Speaker 0: So it's like.

30
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,529
Speaker 0: all I wanted was some playoff games at MSG.

31
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,669
Speaker 0: I got more than I expected to get.

32
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:24,850
Speaker 0: And I am satisfied and my expectations have been fulfilled.

33
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:28,329
Speaker 0: And anything from here on out is just bonus gravy.

34
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,190
Speaker 0: I'll be thrilled if we get even more.

35
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,470
Speaker 0: But I don't, I'm okay because the sooner it ends, right?

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,450
Speaker 0: It's like a win-win either way at this point, right?

37
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,010
Speaker 0: If we keep going, obviously that's a win because we win more, right?

38
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:41,528
Speaker 0: That's great.

39
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:50,110
Speaker 0: But if we lose, the sooner we lose, A, the sooner I can just stop spending my nights watching hockey and do something else.

40
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,450
Speaker 0: Enjoy this nice weather, go outside or whatever.

41
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,670
Speaker 0: And B, that'll save us a lot of money.

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:03,190
Speaker 0: Because every time the Rangers make more games happen at home, the garden comes and just takes money from us because we clicked.

43
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,070
Speaker 0: And we clicked a button that said yes, you can do that.

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,126
Speaker 1: And that amount of money goes up.

45
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:09,369
Speaker 1: As deeper it gets, the more that number goes up.

46
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:15,870
Speaker 0: And as soon as there stop being more games, I can get rimmed to compensate me for most of that money.

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I might have used a significant percentage of those tickets.

48
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:27,770
Speaker 0: I looked at the numbers and sadly, it's not going to be so straightforward to calculate how much money you have to give me.

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,369
Speaker 0: But I came up with a formula that I think is fair.

50
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,949
Speaker 1: Oh, because we don't know the price of the individual games anymore or something like that?

51
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,750
Speaker 0: So, I mean, no one listening gives a shit.

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,270
Speaker 0: But basically, we know the prices of the playoff games exactly, right?

53
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:53,370
Speaker 0: The prices of the regular season games, if we divide the total amount paid by the number of games, including preseason games, then there is a number.

54
00:02:54,071 --> 00:03:06,289
Speaker 0: But last season, when it ended early because of the pandemic, there were three games of six total tickets in which we were compensated for those games with credit to the current season.

55
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:14,950
Speaker 0: And the amount credited was more per ticket than an even division of the total price.

56
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,730
Speaker 0: So that means that we don't know the actual face value of all the tickets.

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,990
Speaker 0: I could just assume that that price is the price of the regular tickets and then price down the preseason tickets.

58
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,096
Speaker 0: But then we've also got to worry about.

59
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:34,490
Speaker 0: there were games where we sold the tickets to third parties and we got random amounts of money.

60
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:39,050
Speaker 0: And there were games that we gave away for free to people, right?

61
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:46,430
Speaker 0: And there were also free gift card monies that you used entirely to buy one jersey.

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,410
Speaker 0: So you owe us back two-thirds of the gift card monies.

63
00:03:51,270 --> 00:04:00,030
Speaker 0: So with all those things combined, I think I have to deploy a percentage-based formula for the non-playoff games.

64
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,389
Speaker 1: It's probably close enough.

65
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,405
Speaker 1: So the first game at home, I guess, will be on Sunday at like 3.30 p.m.

66
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,059
Speaker 1: In the news.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,072
Speaker 1: So last time I went to Anime Central was 2003, is what I want to say.

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,238
Speaker 0: Four lifetimes ago.

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:20,922
Speaker 1: I went in 2002.

70
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:23,680
Speaker 1: I went again in 2003.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,659
Speaker 1: There were some of the best anime cons I've ever been to for a lot of reasons.

72
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:35,340
Speaker 1: Never bothered going back, but I'd always heard until yesterday with this news good things about Anime Central.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,300
Speaker 1: It was one of the larger anime cons, like one of the biggest ones in the Midwest.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,220
Speaker 0: I can imagine if we lived in the Midwest, that would have been like our Otacon instead of Otacon.

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like it was big and solid and just continuing to get better, just like pretty much all anime cons were.

76
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,120
Speaker 0: Or maybe it would have been our anime Boston, you know, but anyway.

77
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:53,980
Speaker 1: So what happened?

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,737
Speaker 0: Or Anime NYC.

79
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:57,278
Speaker 0: Which I've never been to.

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,260
Speaker 1: As you know, there is a global pandemic continuing.

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,218
Speaker 1: It's killed a million people here.

82
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,519
Speaker 0: It's gotten worse.

83
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:07,240
Speaker 1: In fact, it's getting worse and worse and worse right now.

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,379
Speaker 1: A bunch of my coworkers have it.

85
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:12,419
Speaker 0: I have some ill coworkers and I am now again hiding.

86
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:21,780
Speaker 0: I'm only doing inside activities, outside activities, and going to hockey games with the most ridiculous, most powerful mask that hurts my face.

87
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:28,840
Speaker 1: But even now, so one of my coworkers got it right around when I got it, even though I didn't interact with him like a couple months ago.

88
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,399
Speaker 1: He just got it again.

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:31,904
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:32,759
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,220
Speaker 1: Yup.

92
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:47,380
Speaker 1: So anyway, pretty much all fan conventions, except for Paxis and a handful of others, have basically dropped all of their vaccine requirements and mask mandates and basically anything that was even making them remotely safer.

93
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:48,599
Speaker 1: Can't say safe.

94
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,054
Speaker 0: Even Paxis.

95
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,736
Speaker 1: Which did everything as well as you can do it, still had one of the staff die of COVID.

96
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,380
Speaker 0: Right, Paxis killed somebody, right?

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:10,180
Speaker 0: It's like someone made a thread that was basically, I was going to write something along those lines of Paxis killed somebody, which is absolutely true, but someone else wrote it even more angrily than I did, right?

98
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:27,320
Speaker 0: Which is like, you know, it's like no, even the best gaming convention in the universe, right, is not worth, you know, to make it happen, the price of somebody dying before they would have died otherwise is too high a price to pay for just about anything.

99
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,878
Speaker 0: So outside of COVID situations- Let alone just some gaming con.

100
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:36,420
Speaker 1: So does that apply to non-COVID things like someone trips in the stairwell?

101
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:39,489
Speaker 0: I mean, it depends.

102
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,480
Speaker 1: It's like, you know- Someone gets drunk at the con and drunk drives and dies?

103
00:06:45,901 --> 00:07:01,800
Speaker 0: The difference here is that you know that- Oh yeah, yeah, COVID- By having the convention, you are creating, you know, this particular scenario of a large amount of people in an enclosed space while the, you know, a deadly virus is there.

104
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:07,040
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the conditions for someone falling down a stairwell exist everywhere there are stairwells, right?

105
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,880
Speaker 0: That stairwell person might have fallen down the stairwell in their home or their office or a business or wherever, right, if they didn't come to the con.

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,179
Speaker 0: That condition is just existing because stairs are a thing.

107
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:24,180
Speaker 0: But by creating the con, you are creating a new dangerous circumstance that would not have otherwise existed.

108
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:33,700
Speaker 1: So, I have one other question because this is the question everyone's gonna have to grapple with and I do not think that I'm arguing anything here in particular.

109
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,160
Speaker 1: But based on what the CDC's been saying, this might be as good as it gets forever.

110
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:43,580
Speaker 1: It's entirely possible.

111
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:52,440
Speaker 1: And if that's true, then the choice becomes are there cons again at all or not, full stop, with this being the deadly environment.

112
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,979
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, if there's...

113
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,140
Speaker 1: Like, what if COVID is just endemic forever because of all the failures of governments?

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,820
Speaker 0: Well, endemic is different from what we have now, right?

115
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,889
Speaker 1: Well, it might not get better than this.

116
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,740
Speaker 1: This might be what it looks like when it's endemic.

117
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:17,700
Speaker 1: There's two or three waves a year, there's booster shots one or two times a year, but they're not 100% effective, and there's just people die of it for the rest of our lives.

118
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,538
Speaker 0: I mean, that could be a thing.

119
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:24,139
Speaker 1: That seems to be the most likely course.

120
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:33,659
Speaker 0: Let's say that, you know, tornadoes come through once a day and that's just a thing, right?

121
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,059
Speaker 0: Everywhere.

122
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:35,506
Speaker 0: There's no hiding from it.

123
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:36,672
Speaker 0: It's an earth-wide thing.

124
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,340
Speaker 0: Wherever you live on earth, tornadoes...

125
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,999
Speaker 1: I mean, that's kind of what it was like in the summer when I was in Michigan as a kid.

126
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,126
Speaker 0: Right, but I mean, I'm saying everywhere.

127
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:43,769
Speaker 0: There's no running.

128
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,240
Speaker 0: There's no living somewhere else as an alternative, right?

129
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:51,634
Speaker 0: So in that case, it's like, well, you hide in the basement once a day, right?

130
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,080
Speaker 0: That's what you would just do, right?

131
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,219
Speaker 0: It's like to avoid the once a day tornado, you would hide in the basement once a day.

132
00:08:58,483 --> 00:08:59,750
Speaker 1: So what if it could come at any time?

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,400
Speaker 1: Then you're not going to like stay home.

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,780
Speaker 0: You have to be prepared to get to a basement at any time and expect to use the basement once a day.

135
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,066
Speaker 0: No.

136
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,080
Speaker 0: Right?

137
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:11,248
Speaker 0: It's just unless you are, you're not going to just walk around.

138
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,234
Speaker 0: You're not going to say, "Tornadoes every fucking day.

139
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:13,554
Speaker 0: You know what?

140
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,359
Speaker 0: Today, I'm going to stay outside when the tornado

141
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:15,660
Speaker 0: comes.".

142
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,393
Speaker 0: That's your last day, right?

143
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,219
Speaker 0: You're not going to do that.

144
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:27,720
Speaker 0: So if COVID is just like this for the rest of our lives, you're not just going to go and eat inside at a restaurant, right?

145
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,337
Speaker 0: It's like we're going to change our, hopefully change our society.

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,304
Speaker 1: I don't think we will, though.

147
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,955
Speaker 1: I am very confident society will literally 100% give up if that's true.

148
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Speaker 0: Well, if COVID really does stay like this for a long enough period of time... The people who give up, right, will die.

149
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,579
Speaker 1: Up off percentage of the world.

150
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,300
Speaker 0: Eventually, the people who are left are the people who aren't the give up people.

151
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,085
Speaker 1: Not necessarily.

152
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:02,160
Speaker 1: The death rates are not that high to cause that type of outcome.

153
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:04,144
Speaker 0: But who knows?

154
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:05,872
Speaker 0: It could be a strain that comes through, right?

155
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:06,977
Speaker 0: We never know.

156
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,044
Speaker 0: The point is, I'm not going to stop.

157
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:17,440
Speaker 0: If tornadoes came every day, even if for 10 years, 20 years, I would never go outside during the tornado.

158
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,562
Speaker 1: Alright, so I just have a question for you.

159
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:26,940
Speaker 1: If it's about, not the current spike, but the otherwise general background, if it stays around this level forever, will you ever go to a con again or you'd never go to a con again?

160
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,140
Speaker 0: I guess it's going to depend, right?

161
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:46,380
Speaker 0: Unlike the daily tornado, there could be circumstances in which the convention... Okay, they had the convention during a time when the numbers are mega low, and the circumstances of the convention are good.

162
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,432
Speaker 0: The convention itself is going to be so good that it's worth going to, etc.

163
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,940
Speaker 1: Because one thing that's almost definitely not going to happen, I doubt any cons will have masks or vaccine mandates by next year.

164
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we're going to Madison Square Garden for three hours.

165
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,420
Speaker 0: There's no mask mandate, but I wear the most serious mask available, and so far it's worked.

166
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,760
Speaker 1: And we're also some of the only people who are wearing masks in the whole arena.

167
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,559
Speaker 0: Right, so it works even though it's a one-way mask.

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,517
Speaker 1: Well, TVD, if it works or not, we might just be lucky.

169
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:18,899
Speaker 1: so far.

170
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,671
Speaker 0: It works so far.

171
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,619
Speaker 0: That's why I said so far.

172
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,894
Speaker 1: Anyway, Anime Central is in a unique case, and they have fucked up badly.

173
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:30,320
Speaker 1: This is like an unrecoverable situation.

174
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,256
Speaker 1: So they had vaccine requirements, like PAX does, and they had a mask requirement, and they were going to do their event.

175
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,420
Speaker 1: They're still going to do their event.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:50,360
Speaker 1: They had announced officially, weeks ago, that to clarify, because people were worried that the rules would change, that the rules would not change before the con.

177
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:54,220
Speaker 1: That masks were going to be required, and the vaccine checks were going to happen.

178
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,860
Speaker 1: Yesterday, maybe two days ago, they officially announced that they're dropping the mask mandate, and they're dropping the vaccine requirement, and they're not giving refunds to anyone.

179
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:12,440
Speaker 0: Well, see, forget, you know, passing about the discussion about, you know, putting lives at risk to just have an anime con, right?

180
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:22,280
Speaker 0: It's like, if you have a thing, and you sell the thing, and then you change your mind about what the thing is after you sold it.

181
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,913
Speaker 1: And the thing has a disclaimer saying that they can basically screw you over without any recourse at any time.

182
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,520
Speaker 1: Every convention in terms of service has something like that.

183
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:36,819
Speaker 0: They do indeed, but invoking such a clause still makes you a piece of shit, regardless.

184
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,240
Speaker 0: It's like, yes, legally, you can do this, but the fact that you did this, go fuck yourself.

185
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,160
Speaker 1: Now, they're doing it with the same rationale that every other nerd convention did it with.

186
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
Speaker 1: The government let us do it, so we're good.

187
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,822
Speaker 1: Well, they're not even saying it.

188
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:58,200
Speaker 1: They're saying the government changed its guidelines, and the convention center is following those, so we have no choice but to follow those.

189
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,320
Speaker 0: They could have done what AnimeNext did.

190
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Speaker 1: Now, what it appears, one thing that might be going on, it sounds like- AnimeNext did something different, didn't they?

191
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,180
Speaker 1: AnimeNext has a very different contract.

192
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:10,659
Speaker 0: I am aware, but I'm just saying.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,598
Speaker 1: Yes, but it looks like the convention center also said, "We're not gonna make our staff wear masks, nor are we gonna help you with your mask

194
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:19,019
Speaker 1: bullshit.".

195
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:21,680
Speaker 0: That's the Midwest.

196
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,721
Speaker 1: Yep.

197
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:46,740
Speaker 1: So, the only thing I really gotta say about this is, if you bought a badge to AnimeCentral, and you feel uncomfortable going now because of this ridiculous change, which is extra egregious considering they specifically said they would not do this, I would suggest you Google something called "credit card chargeback," and that is how you get a refund.

198
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,400
Speaker 1: Thanks to the terms, right.

199
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,460
Speaker 1: The con might ban you for life, but if enough of you do that, you're basically gonna ban AnimeCentral for life.

200
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:07,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, the terms of service of the ticket purchase, right, the terms and conditions, I guess, because it's not an internet service or whatever, but it's like, you're not gonna be able to go to small claims court to get the money back, right?

201
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:19,543
Speaker 1: But, chargeback on the credit card- Oh, you almost definitely could go to small claims court and get the money back, because a convention like this, there is no universe where they show up to small claims court and you get- That's a good point.

202
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:23,697
Speaker 0: But if they do show up, you're probably gonna lose, because they'll just point out the term and that's it, right?

203
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,400
Speaker 0: There's no refund.

204
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:31,238
Speaker 0: But, I guess if the judge is ornery, the judge might read that term on their own and say, "It says no refund.

205
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:31,619
Speaker 0: Get out of

206
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:31,780
Speaker 0: here.".

207
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,340
Speaker 0: But, yeah, if they don't show up, there is a good chance you just win by default, because the judges just do that.

208
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,439
Speaker 0: Especially if a thousand- I'm not a lawyer, I don't know.

209
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,020
Speaker 1: Especially if thousands of nerds all sue them to small claims court simultaneously.

210
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,398
Speaker 0: The credit card chargeback is much easier, right?

211
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,459
Speaker 1: And the credit card company will pretty much have your back.

212
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only penalty for that is gonna be that, you know, you get banned from Anime Central.

213
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:55,941
Speaker 1: Yep.

214
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:57,284
Speaker 1: It is possible.

215
00:14:57,385 --> 00:15:02,800
Speaker 1: Anime Central could, like, basically sue you and try to send collections after you via the credit card and dispute it.

216
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,060
Speaker 0: For the price of one- It would cost them more to send the collection person to- It absolutely would.

217
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,308
Speaker 0: The money that they would get back for the price of one ticket.

218
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:14,000
Speaker 0: Also, you could just get a different credit card or a friend to buy tickets to a future Anime Central.

219
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:24,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, also, in my experience, it is- All I will say is that I have, many times in my younger, poorer life, been at anime conventions without a badge and no one has ever noticed.

220
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:35,473
Speaker 1: But, anyway, the broader picture that you'll have to start thinking about is, this is pretty much, I'm confident, the last year.

221
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:40,400
Speaker 1: any conventions are gonna even have the pretense of taking measures against COVID.

222
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:47,000
Speaker 1: And everyone's gonna have to collectively decide how they're gonna proceed in terms of gatherings of any kind.

223
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:57,660
Speaker 1: And based on the numbers I've seen, conventions have not seen that much of a drop-off in attendance this year so far, compared to pre-COVID times.

224
00:15:59,001 --> 00:15:59,161
Speaker 0: Yep.

225
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:07,014
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, somewhere, right, there's a COVID virus factory and it's like rubbing its hand.

226
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,117
Speaker 0: It's like, "Yes, I played the long game.

227
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,279
Speaker 0: Yes, it is now

228
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:10,640
Speaker 0: working.".

229
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Speaker 1: But there is this situation where the ship might have sailed and society has to decide how they want to live.

230
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,270
Speaker 1: And I just can't imagine a future if, five years from now, masks were still required.

231
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,020
Speaker 1: I think most people completely give up, regardless of the risks and consequences.

232
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:31,400
Speaker 0: Well.

233
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,279
Speaker 1: In some other news, this looks like an I-Nu-Oh trailer that you just sent me.

234
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've been talking about I-Nu-Oh for a while, 'cause you know we're always waiting for big-time anime theatrical movies to come.

235
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:44,540
Speaker 0: Those are our favorites.

236
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,320
Speaker 1: Especially by the big directors like Yuasa, Makoto Shinkai.

237
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,959
Speaker 0: Especially since I haven't watched a new TV anime in quite a while.

238
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,740
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you didn't watch Orbital Children, the best anime I've seen in at least six years.

239
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,020
Speaker 1: Also Arkane, the best cartoon I've seen in the last decade.

240
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,224
Speaker 0: We've been waiting for I-Nu-Oh for a while.

241
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,271
Speaker 0: We've known about it for a few years now.

242
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,099
Speaker 0: It's finally imminent, like next month imminent.

243
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,752
Speaker 0: And here is a, sorta I guess a trailer, right?

244
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,720
Speaker 0: With no English subtitles or dub or anything.

245
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:27,240
Speaker 0: For that movie, and now you can really, this more than any clip I've seen previously, really tells you what the movie is gonna be like and about.

246
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,368
Speaker 0: And it seems pretty hype, and I wanna see it.

247
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:34,540
Speaker 0: Masaaki Yuasa has been terrific in almost everything that he's done.

248
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,269
Speaker 1: Yuasa is already one of those greats.

249
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,620
Speaker 1: I would wanna show you, when I say Batt in a Thousand, I have to look at the list.

250
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,060
Speaker 1: Real close to Batt in a Thousand.

251
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Speaker 0: Also of note, I didn't send Rim a Link for this, but there was Shin Godzilla, the live action movie directed by Anno, which was maybe the best or second best Godzilla movie thing ever made.

252
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:01,023
Speaker 0: It was really good.

253
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,046
Speaker 0: I loved it, anyway.

254
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,054
Speaker 0: Most people I know loved it.

255
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,340
Speaker 0: I guess there might be some who didn't, but whatever.

256
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,774
Speaker 0: And there's been teasers coming through that they're gonna make a whole universe of like, Shin whatever, right?

257
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,300
Speaker 0: Shin Ultraman, Shin Kamen Rider, right?

258
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,320
Speaker 1: Expand this, give me Shin Snatch.

259
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:27,731
Speaker 0: That's not a... But anyway, Shin Ultraman came out.

260
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,860
Speaker 0: It is in the theaters in Japan now, and it is number one at the box office.

261
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,945
Speaker 0: So, bring me the Shin Ultraman with English subtitles, quickly.

262
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:45,740
Speaker 0: I never even... I can say I know what Ultraman is, but I've never watched an episode or a movie or anything of Ultraman ever.

263
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,980
Speaker 0: I just know what Ultraman is and what he looks like and what his deal is because I'm a nerd.

264
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:52,878
Speaker 0: But I still want to watch this movie.

265
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:05,380
Speaker 1: So, in some other news that leads into our main bit a bit, Crunchyroll, there's a whole situation going on with anime voice acting in America for dubs.

266
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,580
Speaker 0: Which gave us a great Wednesday show idea.

267
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Crunchyroll and that sort of... In the main bit, we're gonna talk about voice acting just overall, not even just in anime.

268
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:22,640
Speaker 1: But in the anime world, there's a lot going on here and you're gonna have to read this article and learn more about this whole space.

269
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,035
Speaker 1: But to summarize, during COVID, voice acting was difficult to do.

270
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,560
Speaker 1: It wasn't safe to do in person.

271
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:35,540
Speaker 1: So a lot of it was done remotely, but doing it remotely did reduce the quality, greatly increased the expenses.

272
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:42,700
Speaker 1: But it also opened up voice acting roles to a much broader and more diverse set of actors.

273
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:48,460
Speaker 1: So there are a lot of positive and negative aspects of this opening up remote.

274
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:56,980
Speaker 1: Simultaneously, Crunchyroll is responsible for most of the dubs that happened in America for anime.

275
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:06,120
Speaker 1: And the studio they use is basically in Texas and they really want all the work to happen in Texas for a lot of reasons.

276
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,000
Speaker 0: Well, they merged with Funimation, which was a big news when he talked about it.

277
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,560
Speaker 0: That now there's basically one major anime player in the US now, The End.

278
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:21,800
Speaker 0: It's not like the old days where there was so much competition and companies are starting and failing all over.

279
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:29,680
Speaker 0: It's Funimation, Crunchyroll, they're on top but everyone else is on a much lower level.

280
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,480
Speaker 1: So there's a group of voice actors trying to unionize.

281
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,440
Speaker 0: If you're a voice actor to voice act anime, it's like that's the sole employer now basically.

282
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,713
Speaker 0: The other companies, like say Discotek, they're not dubbing much.

283
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,980
Speaker 1: And then other stuff is done like Disney will do something itself for a big Ghibli movie that they're going to release.

284
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,890
Speaker 1: So all this is leading to a big conversation around how voice acting and dubbing gets done.

285
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,410
Speaker 1: There's a big unionization effort.

286
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:07,550
Speaker 1: There's voice actors who aggressively want to be back in the studio because the equipment they have at home sucks.

287
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,150
Speaker 1: There's voice actors who are kicked out of the industry because unless they move to Texas, they can't get a job anymore.

288
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,850
Speaker 1: This is all in the backdrop of Texas has turned into a failed fascist state to the point that a lot of people are fleeing Texas.

289
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,196
Speaker 1: Rightly so.

290
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,184
Speaker 1: So it's unethical.

291
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:31,370
Speaker 0: If you're a business who cares about money, operating in Texas is great if you just care about money because like low taxes, low regulations.

292
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:40,670
Speaker 1: But a lot of businesses are having to curtail their Texas operations because people who are qualified to do these jobs are fleeing the state at high rates.

293
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,790
Speaker 1: And very few people are willing to move to Texas to take a job unless they're desperate.

294
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:47,687
Speaker 1: So there's a lot going on here right now.

295
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:51,790
Speaker 1: And it's hard to say where this is all going.

296
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:58,109
Speaker 0: One factor that I brought up on our Discord, which is when we were discussing this earlier today, which you should join.

297
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,510
Speaker 1: Our Discord is pretty good.

298
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:00,652
Speaker 0: Right.

299
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:03,810
Speaker 0: Is that if you are a voice actor and you go to a studio.

300
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:04,591
Speaker 0: Right.

301
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:12,910
Speaker 0: There is an engineer there, a sound engineer, audio engineer, and they're taking care of all the hardware, software, you know, mixing everything for you.

302
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,598
Speaker 1: But also you're in a facility.

303
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:15,884
Speaker 1: There's a quiet room.

304
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,270
Speaker 1: There's the sound dampening.

305
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:18,032
Speaker 0: Right.

306
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:22,250
Speaker 0: But the point is you can focus entirely on acting and your job.

307
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,651
Speaker 0: Right.

308
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:28,010
Speaker 0: If you voice act from home, there is no audio engineer for you.

309
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:29,950
Speaker 0: You are now your own audio engineer.

310
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:33,890
Speaker 0: You are being paid the same amount of money, presumably.

311
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:35,869
Speaker 0: And you are now doing two jobs.

312
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:45,808
Speaker 0: You could have a scenario where you give remote access to your computer to an audio engineer who's remote and they come in and they audio engineer you.

313
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:46,930
Speaker 0: software wise.

314
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,969
Speaker 1: So let me break down what that looks like if I because I'm an audio engineer.

315
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:58,050
Speaker 0: But hardware wise, like they can't do anything for you other than like you can show them what your hardware looks like and they'll tell you what buttons to press.

316
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:05,130
Speaker 1: It's even worse if I because I have done audio work for a few small video games.

317
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,709
Speaker 1: I've done audio work for a bunch of things over the years, of course, producing gig nights forever.

318
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,149
Speaker 1: And one of the things that I rely on is that I know the physical environment things are recorded in.

319
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:21,190
Speaker 1: And I have built pipelines based on that.

320
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:24,150
Speaker 1: I have a pipeline for Scott from home that took a while to set up.

321
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:26,249
Speaker 1: I have a separate pipeline for if Scott is here.

322
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:27,841
Speaker 1: I have one pipeline for me.

323
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:29,110
Speaker 1: I have one pipeline for Emily.

324
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:42,530
Speaker 1: If I have to merge audio, especially dialogue that was recorded in multiple separate environments, that increases my workload by an order of magnitude.

325
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,250
Speaker 0: That is, I mean, you're still going to have to send in your recorded WAV files to be mastered, mixed, whatever.

326
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:48,792
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

327
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:52,070
Speaker 1: But now every WAV file needs bespoke work.

328
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:55,250
Speaker 1: It's almost like color matching in film.

329
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:56,054
Speaker 0: Right.

330
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:58,850
Speaker 0: Well, that person still has their job and they're doing that part of it.

331
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,990
Speaker 0: But their job is now we're talking about the engineering that is done during the recording session.

332
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:12,508
Speaker 0: The person who is at the board while the recording is happening, adjusting the levels and that sort of thing, that that job is now gone.

333
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:16,270
Speaker 0: And this voice or remote and poor.

334
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,890
Speaker 0: And now this voice actor has to do it themselves and isn't being compensated extra for doing that.

335
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:33,170
Speaker 1: But I'm saying also the studio now has to hire more audio engineers or pay the people who are doing that work a lot more because they have to post work, not the during recording work.

336
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

337
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,729
Speaker 1: The post work is a lot more than the pre-work.

338
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:37,611
Speaker 0: Right.

339
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:46,230
Speaker 0: But now also write the forgetting about the the the the actual quality of the audio recording, like, you know, that quality.

340
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:51,370
Speaker 0: But think about the quality of the acting of someone who is fully immersed in acting.

341
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,670
Speaker 0: It has no other distractions versus someone who is acting and then has to adjust shit.

342
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:01,910
Speaker 0: Also, also now has to do a worse job of acting as on one hand, remote recording.

343
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:12,070
Speaker 1: As we noted before, there is direct evidence that it broadened the diversity of voice actors and gave a lot of what wider audience of people who are good at this job the ability to do it.

344
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:24,030
Speaker 1: But it also really only became accessible to people who have those skills and had the equipment to be able to do this from home or they were subcontracting out and reducing their own salaries.

345
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,210
Speaker 1: I don't there is no good answer to this.

346
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,850
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously, we got to get this stuff out of Texas because I don't think Texas can be saved in the short term.

347
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,010
Speaker 1: It's probably unethical to even send money to Texas.

348
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:44,590
Speaker 1: But that aside, I can I don't see a way to resolve this because it is irrespective of all other externalities.

349
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:50,930
Speaker 1: It is objectively higher quality work to do this in professional studios with people in person.

350
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:56,770
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's also higher quality work to get all the actors in the studio together to sort of the cast.

351
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,962
Speaker 0: I forget what the word for it.

352
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:58,650
Speaker 0: The ensemble.

353
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:00,400
Speaker 1: Well, that's what we used to see.

354
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:01,829
Speaker 1: That was in the early anime dubs.

355
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:10,830
Speaker 1: American anime dubs were usually produced the way a lot of American cartoons were, where every voice actor's performances were recorded completely independently of each other.

356
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:12,969
Speaker 1: And they'd be all merged together in post.

357
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,330
Speaker 0: And the Japanese ones typically did the ensemble.

358
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:23,070
Speaker 0: Now, obviously, the pandemic messes up your ensemble, even if you bring people in studio, regardless of what different countries practices were.

359
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,551
Speaker 0: Right.

360
00:26:23,692 --> 00:26:29,930
Speaker 0: But it's like if they actually cared about making the best dub, it's like they would do the ensemble thing.

361
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,514
Speaker 0: Right.

362
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:31,461
Speaker 0: And they never did that.

363
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:32,710
Speaker 0: So there was never a care.

364
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:42,670
Speaker 0: So even worse, the best dub that the care is just get a dub because we've done the math and we figured out that if we only do subtitles, we won't get enough views.

365
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:47,630
Speaker 0: And the money it costs to do the dub will get us this many more views, this many more sales.

366
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,690
Speaker 0: And it comes out to be worth it as long as the dub is cheap enough.

367
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:57,450
Speaker 0: And the quality of the dub, it's like it doesn't seem to is not going to increase the views and sales.

368
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,489
Speaker 0: So it's not worth it to them to do that.

369
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,391
Speaker 1: Yep.

370
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:03,059
Speaker 1: And even worse, ensemble recording.

371
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,790
Speaker 1: Like technically what Scott and I are doing now is an ensemble voice session.

372
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,817
Speaker 1: The two of us.

373
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:09,389
Speaker 1: We have infrastructure set up to do this.

374
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,410
Speaker 1: Let's forget how moderately complex it was to set this infrastructure up.

375
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:21,390
Speaker 1: This literally doubles the post-production time I need to spend to get a Geek Nights episode live.

376
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,017
Speaker 1: It literally doubles it.

377
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,729
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of extra work I have to do.

378
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,470
Speaker 1: And that's just with two people where one, I sent Scott the fucking microphone he uses.

379
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,410
Speaker 1: And two, I trust Scott to know how to set up a microphone.

380
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,869
Speaker 0: Plug it into a box.

381
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,681
Speaker 1: You set your levels the right way.

382
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:41,504
Speaker 1: There's stuff there.

383
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:42,970
Speaker 1: Your audio is well recorded.

384
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:51,090
Speaker 1: But it's double effort just to have one person who's not in the studio in an ensemble recording.

385
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,506
Speaker 1: And it doubles again for every additional person.

386
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:55,189
Speaker 1: Ten people.

387
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:02,990
Speaker 0: I don't think you're going to do a voice acting ensemble where everyone is remote because you're losing the whole interactive part of the people.

388
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:06,010
Speaker 0: It's like in the delay on it wouldn't work, right?

389
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,961
Speaker 1: Never mind the local time stamps.

390
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,450
Speaker 1: The timing will be slightly off on every recording.

391
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,270
Speaker 1: I have to fuck with Scott's audio because it's impossible to line up audio.

392
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,589
Speaker 1: The clocks are not the same clock.

393
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:29,189
Speaker 1: And even beyond that, have you noticed for the last three years, and it's not just Geek Nights, many podcasts, many podcasts, the hosts talk over each other a little bit more than they used to.

394
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:32,249
Speaker 1: And they run over each other a little bit more than they used to.

395
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,279
Speaker 1: That's because this is not real time.

396
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,650
Speaker 1: There are slight delays and ebb and flow of the network infrastructure.

397
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:45,929
Speaker 1: And those delays add up to the same thing you see in live news broadcasts where there's a pause like, "Back to you,

398
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:46,230
Speaker 1: Andy.".

399
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:51,150
Speaker 1: And there's a pause before Andy responds and says, "Thank you, John," and does his thing.

400
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:53,790
Speaker 1: So all of that combined makes it infeasible.

401
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,590
Speaker 1: Never mind the fact that voice actors get paid shit because capitalism.

402
00:28:59,698 --> 00:28:59,890
Speaker 0: Yep.

403
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:04,390
Speaker 1: And like you pointed out, I haven't watched a dubbed anime on purpose.

404
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,528
Speaker 1: I can't remember the last anime I watched dubbed in purpose except Cowboy Bebop.

405
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,646
Speaker 1: The dubs, I would never watch an anime dub.

406
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,130
Speaker 1: Why would I?

407
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,209
Speaker 1: Generally, any media, I'd like to see the original audio subtitles if I can.

408
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:27,030
Speaker 1: And dubs almost, I think, are becoming more of a checkbox in the anime industry in America.

409
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,529
Speaker 1: So they can say there's a dub and potentially syndicate on TV.

410
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:35,050
Speaker 1: And also an accessibility function for people who couldn't read subtitles.

411
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,653
Speaker 1: And I think that's it.

412
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:43,749
Speaker 1: So that's even more reasons beyond just the fact that it doesn't make them money, why the quality of the dubs actually doesn't really matter that much.

413
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:46,718
Speaker 0: To the producer.

414
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

415
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,180
Speaker 1: Or even to the consumers, frankly.

416
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,860
Speaker 0: There are some consumers that care a lot and some that don't.

417
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,100
Speaker 1: Yep.

418
00:29:53,221 --> 00:30:01,019
Speaker 1: But I still get the impression the majority of people who watch anime to the level that they know Crunchyroll exists, care about anime, and are invested in it.

419
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,680
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of people who tend to watch things subtitled anyway.

420
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,850
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

421
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,136
Speaker 1: So, I can only do this once.

422
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:17,770
Speaker 1: Every year there's a song competition in Europe called Eurovision.

423
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,523
Speaker 1: You might have heard of it.

424
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,910
Speaker 0: What about the ripoff of America's Song Contest?

425
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,749
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

426
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,745
Speaker 1: So, Eurovision, I love Eurovision.

427
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:38,550
Speaker 1: But I gotta say, 2022, as far as I have seen, I haven't watched every song, but I've seen most of them so far, it is one of the better Eurovisions of the last five years.

428
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:39,528
Speaker 1: This is an above.

429
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:41,190
Speaker 0: By our measures.

430
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:41,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

431
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:48,990
Speaker 1: In terms of what I want from Eurovision, 2022 is delivered in a way that the last four years of Eurovision have not.

432
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,030
Speaker 1: This is a good Eurovision.

433
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,330
Speaker 1: So, what I'm going to link to, my thing of the day, there are a bunch of great songs.

434
00:30:56,132 --> 00:31:01,530
Speaker 1: But mine, my thing of the day is, every year in Eurovision there's that one song.

435
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:08,250
Speaker 1: The song that people talk about and maybe make memes of or get stuck in their head and they laugh about.

436
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,429
Speaker 1: The weird one.

437
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:10,308
Speaker 1: The one.

438
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:19,330
Speaker 1: And this year I think that one is a song called Give That Wolf a Banana by a delightful band called Subwoofler.

439
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:24,970
Speaker 1: Whose shtick is that they're dressed up as yellow wolves and they sing about eating grandmas.

440
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,309
Speaker 0: Wait, Subwoofler?

441
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,782
Speaker 0: Yup.

442
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:27,394
Speaker 0: Oh, like woof?

443
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,099
Speaker 0: Like a dog?

444
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,946
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't it be Subwoofer?

445
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:30,930
Speaker 1: It's Subwoofer.

446
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,030
Speaker 0: So, Subwoofer.

447
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,430
Speaker 1: Okay.

448
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,529
Speaker 1: S-U-B-W-O-O-L-F-E-R.

449
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:44,346
Speaker 0: Okay, but keeping the original word, subwoofer, woof, is like dogs.

450
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,570
Speaker 0: go woof, so do wolves.

451
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,410
Speaker 1: Oh, they're equally good.

452
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,048
Speaker 1: The old meme was you have a big dog and that's a woof, you have a tiny dog and that's a subwoof.

453
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,670
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like, subwoofer also makes sense pun-wise.

454
00:31:55,271 --> 00:32:01,170
Speaker 0: It's like, without seeing the word, you couldn't know which pun they were going for because both of them are valid.

455
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,370
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I found another.

456
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,390
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to link to this too because it would be cheating to use this twice.

457
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:17,990
Speaker 1: I just found a video that Subwoofer put out officially that teaches you how to do the dance in their Eurovision performance.

458
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:20,416
Speaker 1: We can learn this dance.

459
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,189
Speaker 1: This is not harder than Mambileo.

460
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,049
Speaker 0: Well, do your dance.

461
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,610
Speaker 0: Maybe I will.

462
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,509
Speaker 0: Dancing rim TikTok.

463
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,249
Speaker 1: I'll be making a Patreon exclusive, so what are you at?

464
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:44,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know, at least not recently at all, like actually many years ago already, there was a moment at which the United States turned off the analog over-the-air television.

465
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:44,900
Speaker 0: Yep.

466
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,930
Speaker 0: And we, I think we've used this thing of the day, like, you know, some broadcast like final moments stuff, right?

467
00:32:51,611 --> 00:33:00,828
Speaker 0: But there was a time even before I was alive, which was the moment when, you know, it's like they had television running live 24/7, right?

468
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,112
Speaker 0: In the United States, right?

469
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:11,050
Speaker 0: Or at least, you know, much of it was live, but there was always a broadcast going 24/7 over the air and they only had black and white TV.

470
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,369
Speaker 0: And then one day they had color TV.

471
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:28,910
Speaker 1: And the way we've done, we've talked about this on Geek Nights before, color TV just used extra signal space and trickery in the existing black and like the existing TV signals that worked on black and white TVs.

472
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:34,410
Speaker 1: So you could broadcast something in color, but a black and white TV receiving it would work just fine.

473
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:35,269
Speaker 1: Yeah.

474
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,348
Speaker 1: That's important for this.

475
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:36,809
Speaker 1: Right.

476
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:41,365
Speaker 0: But anyway, so it's like, okay, so you're, you're in the 1950s, sixties, whenever it was right.

477
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:49,030
Speaker 0: And it's like you go out and you buy yourself, you got to be saved up some money and you got a black and white TV at home.

478
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,069
Speaker 0: You go buy a color one.

479
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:50,930
Speaker 0: Right.

480
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,349
Speaker 0: And you set it up and you turn it on.

481
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:59,010
Speaker 0: And it's like at that time, it's like, you know, it's like some of the channels going to be black and white.

482
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,010
Speaker 0: And some of them went to color already.

483
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,161
Speaker 0: Right.

484
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,450
Speaker 0: Big time channels.

485
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:02,850
Speaker 0: Right.

486
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:07,130
Speaker 0: You know, because obviously they weren't selling color TVs before there were any color channels.

487
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:10,449
Speaker 0: But the TV network also had to switch.

488
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,130
Speaker 0: There had to be a moment and a precise moment for the dog in a channel.

489
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:15,010
Speaker 1: Right.

490
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:20,850
Speaker 0: A precise moment at the TV station where they said, all right, we're all broadcasting black and white pictures.

491
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:21,610
Speaker 0: Right.

492
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,310
Speaker 0: Well, we got new cameras in the studio.

493
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:28,330
Speaker 0: And at this moment, we're going to switch and broadcast color over the air instead.

494
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:28,830
Speaker 0: Right.

495
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,708
Speaker 0: We're going to flip a switch.

496
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:41,350
Speaker 0: And if you were watching TV at that moment on a black and white TV, you wouldn't realize you wouldn't really notice much happening, except maybe the image getting a little bit better, but still being black and white.

497
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:48,150
Speaker 1: Or possibly getting worse because sets for TV were designed for black and white TV for a long time.

498
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:53,130
Speaker 1: And they had to be designed differently for color for it to look good for a bunch.

499
00:34:53,130 --> 00:35:02,130
Speaker 0: But sometimes the color image, you know, the source, the cameras were so much better that it's like if you're, you know, a lot of black and white TVs, a color signal would look better.

500
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,790
Speaker 0: Even though anyway.

501
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:05,234
Speaker 0: But there was.

502
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:08,950
Speaker 0: if you had a color TV, you'd be watching a TV channel that was in black and white.

503
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:14,810
Speaker 0: And if you happen to be watching at that one moment in all of history where the channel switched to color, what would you see?

504
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:26,130
Speaker 0: Well, here's a YouTube video of a recording of the news in Iowa at the moment that this channel two in Iowa switched from black and white to color.

505
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:31,789
Speaker 1: I love how he walks across to like the other set that they had built with a different set of cameras pointed at it.

506
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:32,734
Speaker 0: Yep.

507
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:33,178
Speaker 0: Well, that's how.

508
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,570
Speaker 0: that's how big of a switch it was.

509
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:34,811
Speaker 0: Right.

510
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:39,390
Speaker 0: They had to switch these cameras, stop broadcasting those cameras, start broadcast.

511
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,611
Speaker 0: Yep.

512
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:43,590
Speaker 1: They even switch his love like after he gets to the new desk.

513
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,470
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't have wireless ones in those days, so he had to eat the wire for the love he was using.

514
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,697
Speaker 0: Just couldn't reach across to.

515
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:52,030
Speaker 0: he couldn't walk across the studio while wired up.

516
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,471
Speaker 0: Right.

517
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:57,048
Speaker 1: So, you know, they did have back then, though, the only girl sure.

518
00:35:58,371 --> 00:35:58,732
Speaker 1: S.M.

519
00:35:58,732 --> 00:35:59,994
Speaker 0: 57.

520
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:00,235
Speaker 0: Sure.

521
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:08,090
Speaker 0: But anyway, so yet here is exactly what you would have seen if you had a color TV in Iowa in whatever year this was.

522
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:15,470
Speaker 0: And we're watching the news when the whole network switched permanently from broadcasting black and white to broadcasting color.

523
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:23,029
Speaker 1: In the moment, the geek guides book club book is nine, five, scam it within the next month or so.

524
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:24,114
Speaker 1: We'll just do the show.

525
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,399
Speaker 1: I'm real.

526
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,865
Speaker 1: I think this weekend I might even finish it.

527
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:27,990
Speaker 1: It's a good book.

528
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:33,950
Speaker 1: I do want to read the sequels, even though the listener did say that the sequels weren't as good.

529
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:43,630
Speaker 1: Well, they said two people said the sequels weren't as good, but they also said that the sequels focus on something very different in this universe from what the first book focuses on.

530
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:49,066
Speaker 1: But what they said the second and third book focus on is actually the kind of thing I'm way into.

531
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:50,350
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

532
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,079
Speaker 0: It could be sort of like Hyperion.

533
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,350
Speaker 0: By the way, the author of Hyperion is awful.

534
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:58,538
Speaker 0: We learned that way after doing that episode.

535
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:01,949
Speaker 1: Also, he got worse and worse as time went on.

536
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,778
Speaker 1: And he's written a few good books, but he's a bad person.

537
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:06,740
Speaker 0: Right.

538
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,729
Speaker 0: But anyway, it could be like that where like the first book or two.

539
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:11,592
Speaker 0: Right.

540
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:12,736
Speaker 0: It's like there's the story.

541
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:16,210
Speaker 0: But then there's also like the book itself is, you know, a great book.

542
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,795
Speaker 0: Bad people can make good things.

543
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:18,036
Speaker 0: Right.

544
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:21,850
Speaker 0: But then after that, it's like not as good.

545
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,222
Speaker 0: But there's that you still have some desire to know what happens.

546
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,530
Speaker 0: that could keep you going to reading bad books.

547
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,502
Speaker 1: That's why I read all 14 books of The Wheel of Time.

548
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:31,065
Speaker 0: Right.

549
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,230
Speaker 0: Same deal with Dune, right?

550
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:38,250
Speaker 0: It's like you read this book and then, you know, you keep going because you want to know what happens, even though they're not good anymore.

551
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,733
Speaker 0: But you just want to know what happens.

552
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:40,094
Speaker 0: Yeah.

553
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:47,630
Speaker 1: I started just reading wikis about shows and about books if I don't want to bother.

554
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,292
Speaker 1: That's what I do.

555
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,516
Speaker 0: Life's too short for that shit.

556
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:50,058
Speaker 1: Yep.

557
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,864
Speaker 1: Love, for example, Attack on Titan.

558
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,590
Speaker 1: First season, really intrigued.

559
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,015
Speaker 1: Second season, got worried.

560
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:58,850
Speaker 1: Went and read a wiki, realized there was no reason to watch any more of that show.

561
00:37:59,790 --> 00:37:59,890
Speaker 0: Right.

562
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:00,172
Speaker 0: I can.

563
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:04,570
Speaker 0: If all I want to do is know what happens, I can do that in a lot less time than it takes to watch the whole thing.

564
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,151
Speaker 1: Yep.

565
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:09,610
Speaker 1: Attack on Titan is kind of a stinker if you actually watch more of it.

566
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:17,890
Speaker 1: If you haven't watched the new Attack on Titan, my advice to you is if you have fond memories of the old one, just let them remain fond.

567
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,736
Speaker 1: Don't go back and watch He-Man again.

568
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:22,205
Speaker 1: That's all I'll say.

569
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:22,707
Speaker 1: It's bad.

570
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,092
Speaker 1: So let's get into it.

571
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:27,037
Speaker 1: Voice actors, voice acting.

572
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:32,070
Speaker 0: We did a big news on voice acting, which gave us the idea to do an episode on it, which we never have done.

573
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,916
Speaker 0: Obviously, we have no experience.

574
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,687
Speaker 0: We have almost no experience voice acting.

575
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:37,610
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say zero.

576
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:44,345
Speaker 1: We have voice acted in a handful of zero-budget productions over the years.

577
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:46,530
Speaker 1: Like Valiant Denim.

578
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,093
Speaker 0: One and a half.

579
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:48,321
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

580
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,570
Speaker 0: That was the one I was thinking of.

581
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:57,024
Speaker 1: I have recorded voice performances for two or three peoples, depending on what you count.

582
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,650
Speaker 1: They're audition tapes to be voice actors.

583
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,879
Speaker 1: I've also recorded voice acting for some video games.

584
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,990
Speaker 1: I've recorded voice acting for trailers for some Kickstarter.

585
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:10,709
Speaker 1: I've got a little more direct experience, but I don't want to overstate that.

586
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,683
Speaker 0: I've done narrating at the school play, which is sort of like voice acting.

587
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:16,890
Speaker 0: Only people can see you standing over there in the corner.

588
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,575
Speaker 1: I've been the emcee of many a function over the years.

589
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:23,942
Speaker 1: I have narrated technical and instructional videos.

590
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:27,048
Speaker 1: That's actually something I've done professionally for 20 years now.

591
00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:35,203
Speaker 0: The point is that voice acting inherently is the same as acting acting.

592
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,267
Speaker 0: Stage acting, movie acting, TV acting.

593
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,090
Speaker 0: The only difference is that nobody can see you.

594
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:49,690
Speaker 0: So you have to express the character that you are portraying only with the power of the sounds that you can make with your body.

595
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:51,936
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to be just your voice.

596
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:55,806
Speaker 0: You could use any part of your body or device that makes noises.

597
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,510
Speaker 0: Usually it's just your voice, though.

598
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:03,342
Speaker 0: If they want to add noises of some other sort, the audio people can do that on their own.

599
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:06,350
Speaker 0: They don't need the voice actors to do that other stuff.

600
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:13,342
Speaker 0: You don't need to be in there voice acting a Star Wars cartoon, making lightsaber noises with your mouth.

601
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:15,828
Speaker 0: They can add those in on their own.

602
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:16,430
Speaker 0: They don't need you.

603
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,852
Speaker 1: What was the thing I saw?

604
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:30,629
Speaker 1: where you can clearly see actors in one of the recent Star Wars' at a few points in the final cut of the movie clearly saying "pew pew" or making some sort of laser sound with their mouth as they're firing?

605
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:36,356
Speaker 0: So there's sort of two major things going on.

606
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:44,710
Speaker 0: One of them is that you have to have this ability to speak usually in a different voice than your natural voice.

607
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,793
Speaker 1: Well, there's very much two kinds of voice actors.

608
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:50,941
Speaker 1: There are professional voice actors who have an array of voices.

609
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:55,510
Speaker 1: They have a range of character voices they could do and they can make up new ones.

610
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:03,770
Speaker 1: So you show them a character, you collaborate with them, and together you come up with the voice of a character that they then embody.

611
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:11,250
Speaker 1: But then you've got people like John Benjamin who, everything they voice act, they sound the same and it's fine.

612
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:14,554
Speaker 1: Or like Bender.

613
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:28,770
Speaker 1: Sometimes there's a voice actor, even if they can do multiple voices, either their natural voice is really good for voice acting or a voice that might have been part of their repertoire just became an iconic voice that they use for much of their career.

614
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,953
Speaker 0: Rest in peace, Gilbert Gottfried.

615
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:38,720
Speaker 0: The voice he spoke, whenever he was in public, that was not his natural speaking voice.

616
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,981
Speaker 0: That is well known.

617
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:47,209
Speaker 0: I've heard his real "natural speaking voice" and it is not "Hey, I'm Gilbert

618
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:47,609
Speaker 0: Gottfried.".

619
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,656
Speaker 0: But he just talked like that in every professional setting.

620
00:41:53,696 --> 00:41:57,902
Speaker 0: If he was being interviewed, if he was voice acting, he had the one voice that he did.

621
00:41:57,942 --> 00:42:03,990
Speaker 0: He didn't do other voices and he only used his natural voice in private settings.

622
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:18,030
Speaker 1: Similar to Geek Nights, if you see us do panels and you're listening to this, we're not acting acting, but the way we talk on a show like this is not how I talk when I'm just living my life.

623
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:20,790
Speaker 0: But that's not an intentional thing.

624
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:26,078
Speaker 1: No it's not, but it's an artifact of the fact that we're talking to a microphone without an audience.

625
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:33,850
Speaker 1: Also it's an artifact of the nature of a podcast, but we shout and yell and all this stuff that in real life we're a lot more subdued.

626
00:42:35,371 --> 00:43:06,770
Speaker 0: The point is that even if you are a regular actor, stage, screen actor, people are seeing you, having the ability to have a natural voice that is particular, like say Sean Connery, have a voice that you do that is particular in some way, or have the ability to do lots of voices, are just tools of even a stage and screen actor.

627
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:26,310
Speaker 0: So a voice actor is basically, it's like you just highly specialize in this one aspect of acting, which is that tool set only and not in expressing yourself with your facial expression or your hands, even though you might do those things as well, no one will see them.

628
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:36,925
Speaker 0: And this is why you do see often, especially productions with more money, can use stage and screen actors for voice acting because they also have those skills.

629
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:40,510
Speaker 0: Voice actors just specialize in those skills exclusively.

630
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:50,927
Speaker 1: So a thing that I think is worth noting is there has been a little bit of a change in this industry, not so much with anime, but with the rest of the voice acting world.

631
00:43:50,968 --> 00:43:52,250
Speaker 1: I saw some articles about it recently.

632
00:43:53,331 --> 00:44:20,250
Speaker 1: It's obvious in retrospect, if you think about what's popular, there is increasing demand for voice actors who are also professional singers because a lot of animated shows in particular have more and more music in them, which is drastically limiting the pool of people who are qualified to be both a professional voice actor who can do a character and who can sing professionally at the level that would be needed for a show.

633
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:30,867
Speaker 1: In the past, a lot of the way that was handled, even in movies, was to have someone who sounds kind of like the voice actor sing when the voice actor needed to sing.

634
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:32,910
Speaker 1: A lot of old Disney movies did that.

635
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:41,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it always comes across great because even in the real world, people, you know, just people you meet, it's like they sing in one way.

636
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:45,070
Speaker 0: and when they, you know, it's just meet a person who's a singer and isn't an actor at all.

637
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,711
Speaker 0: They sing.

638
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:50,178
Speaker 0: They don't sound like they do when they talk, right?

639
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:52,522
Speaker 0: They clearly have a different singing voice.

640
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:55,447
Speaker 0: It might be related to the talking voice.

641
00:44:55,507 --> 00:44:56,990
Speaker 0: It might not be, right?

642
00:44:57,251 --> 00:45:00,901
Speaker 0: You know, there's even people who have like very strong accents, right?

643
00:45:00,982 --> 00:45:03,790
Speaker 0: And their singing voice has a completely different accent, right?

644
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:12,309
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there's a thing people are like, "How come when people from the UK sing, they sound like they have a US accent,

645
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:12,650
Speaker 0: right?".

646
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:14,361
Speaker 0: It's like there's a whole thing about that online.

647
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:15,790
Speaker 0: You can look it up, right?

648
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:22,962
Speaker 0: So using someone else to do the singing part is not out of the ordinary.

649
00:45:22,982 --> 00:45:24,385
Speaker 0: It totally works great.

650
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:26,450
Speaker 0: Like the audience almost never knows.

651
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:33,170
Speaker 0: But it is more expensive because you're hiring someone who is a professional singer first to do the singing.

652
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:37,207
Speaker 0: If you hire the one voice actor to do the singing and that, right?

653
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:37,830
Speaker 0: You can save money.

654
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:46,150
Speaker 1: But it also greatly complicates the production because now you have to figure out in advance exactly what will be sung and won and get all those takes separately from the voice acting.

655
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,034
Speaker 1: It's harder to change things on the fly.

656
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:54,730
Speaker 1: It's harder to have a character naturally come in and out of singing, which also is increasingly common.

657
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,830
Speaker 0: Song recording is different from voice recording.

658
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:01,910
Speaker 1: And I think that's only going to continue.

659
00:46:03,395 --> 00:46:05,310
Speaker 0: As long as musicals are popular.

660
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:13,950
Speaker 1: And right now, especially in animation in the US, musical animation is only getting more popular and only becoming a bigger piece of the pie.

661
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:20,422
Speaker 0: I think it's always been huge in children's content, right?

662
00:46:20,462 --> 00:46:23,930
Speaker 0: There's always been songs, even if they're like little nursery rhyme type songs.

663
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:27,029
Speaker 0: That's just always been there, right?

664
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,806
Speaker 1: So another aspect of all this...

665
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,215
Speaker 0: It's spread more, right?

666
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:37,350
Speaker 0: I think The Simpsons did it once in a while, but then you had the other shows doing it frequently.

667
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:44,610
Speaker 1: So another aspect of this is a lot of acting, but voice acting has particular concerns around this.

668
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:59,130
Speaker 1: It is also not a sport in the competitive sense, but it requires a certain amount of physical luck in terms of are your vocal chords and lungs and head and face shape conducive to voice acting?

669
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,890
Speaker 1: Like there are things that could get in your way, especially if you will play multiple characters.

670
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:07,250
Speaker 1: You can have injuries just like you could on the set of a play or the set of a movie.

671
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,780
Speaker 1: A lot of voice actors destroy their voices.

672
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,730
Speaker 1: It's a problem in the industry.

673
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:15,410
Speaker 0: You need vocal coaches, vocal training if you're going to do it, right?

674
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,240
Speaker 1: I mean, Scott and I had to learn significantly.

675
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,650
Speaker 1: We used to lose our voices after every major con, me way more so than Scott.

676
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:30,870
Speaker 1: I had to learn to talk differently, and I talk differently with a microphone than I do in person just hanging out with people.

677
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:38,203
Speaker 0: Sure, but there are people who... It's like you might be able to talk in a really funny voice, right?

678
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,810
Speaker 0: And you think I could be a voice actor, right?

679
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,790
Speaker 0: All your friends are super entertained by your funny voices that you do, and you're great.

680
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:49,470
Speaker 0: All right, go and do that funny voice for five, six hours, seven hours.

681
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,790
Speaker 0: And also do the same lines over and over again.

682
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,410
Speaker 1: You've got to say a line in that same funny voice, but it's a sad line.

683
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:58,595
Speaker 1: Can you still do it?

684
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,739
Speaker 1: Can you act it?

685
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,470
Speaker 1: Or can you just do the facile voice?

686
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:04,656
Speaker 0: And the endurance aspect, right?

687
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:09,790
Speaker 0: It's like if you can't do it, then it's not an easy job at all, right?

688
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:20,590
Speaker 0: And people, when they think of voice acting, especially when we do this on Geek Nights Wednesday, you're mostly thinking about it in the context of cartoons and animation, right?

689
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:26,850
Speaker 0: Animated content, whether it's computer-generated, hand-drawn, 2D, 3D, whatever, video games, right?

690
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,075
Speaker 0: That's what you're thinking about.

691
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:36,070
Speaker 0: And the fact is there is a lot more content out there that requires voice acting than just those things.

692
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,110
Speaker 0: Those are just the most visible things, right?

693
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,590
Speaker 0: There are also lots and lots of, say, instructional videos that need narrators, right?

694
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:49,350
Speaker 0: There are lots and lots of live-action things that are still dubbed, right?

695
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,755
Speaker 0: You've seen Star Wars, right?

696
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:54,990
Speaker 0: James Earl Jones, everybody knows, was not in the Darth Vader costume.

697
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:01,550
Speaker 1: Hell, a lot of old movies, but they still do this when they need to, less often because obviously it really hurts the acting.

698
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:14,470
Speaker 1: A lot of movies, especially older movies, would do ADR and dub over the on-screen spoken lines of the actors because microphones weren't that good, especially in the past.

699
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:24,710
Speaker 0: Someone would go in and act in a movie, and then after they acted in the movie on the set, they would go into the audio booth and record their own voice over themselves.

700
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,219
Speaker 1: And the worst part is it's so obvious that that was happening.

701
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,250
Speaker 1: now that you can see a lot of these old movies and old TV shows in high-resolution remastering.

702
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,180
Speaker 0: That's why it's really good if you have a Darth Vader who doesn't have a mouth that moves.

703
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,330
Speaker 0: You can put any voice you want on there.

704
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:58,010
Speaker 1: Another really increasingly complex part of this is diversity in casting, especially because if you can't see the person, some people who are wrong try to argue that it doesn't matter if a white person plays a black person, for example.

705
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,589
Speaker 1: All that matters is the voice that comes out at the end.

706
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:25,290
Speaker 1: And obviously that is not true, and obviously there's a lot of nuance in that whole conversation, but voice acting also requires a certain amount of expertise in accents, in language, in languages, in being able to learn and speak in particular accurate sub-dialects depending on what kind of character you're playing.

707
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:28,930
Speaker 1: These are technical, learned academic skills.

708
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:36,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you go out there, it's like, you know, I could do a Scottish accent, like, "Oh,

709
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:36,929
Speaker 0: milady!".

710
00:50:37,992 --> 00:50:44,930
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, it's like, if I do that, it's like, yeah, you realize that I'm making fun of Scottish voices, right?

711
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:50,810
Speaker 0: Which actually I think are cool, despite, you know, characters like Sean Connery and Scoop McDuck, right?

712
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:59,390
Speaker 1: But look at Apu and the right and correct controversy around that accent and that voice acting.

713
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:07,110
Speaker 0: I can say that every Scottish person that I have met and known to be, you know, have an acquaintance with has been a really cool person.

714
00:51:07,452 --> 00:51:07,648
Speaker 0: So anyway.

715
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,429
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember the cool Scottish dude that we ran into a few times.

716
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,569
Speaker 0: That was one of the people I was just thinking of.

717
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,185
Speaker 1: We went to the sci-fi museum together.

718
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:15,630
Speaker 1: It was a good time.

719
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:20,050
Speaker 0: There was also that engineer guy who was a Scottish person in New York who played games with a bunch.

720
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:20,916
Speaker 0: That guy was cool, too.

721
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:21,623
Speaker 0: I forget his name.

722
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:22,410
Speaker 0: Sorry, person.

723
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:25,549
Speaker 0: I think you listened to Geek Nights at some point a hundred years ago.

724
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:31,460
Speaker 0: If I go and do that voice, right?

725
00:51:35,534 --> 00:51:37,750
Speaker 0: It is nowhere near accurate, right?

726
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,210
Speaker 0: It's so off, right?

727
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:42,004
Speaker 0: It would drive a Scottish person wild to hear.

728
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:51,690
Speaker 0: And if I'm doing that for a character, even if it was for, you know, if it was for a stereotype character, well, that's just offensive, right?

729
00:51:52,110 --> 00:52:05,930
Speaker 0: And if it was for a character who was just like, you know, let's say it's a new My Little Pony and there's a pony with haggis on its ass or a golf club and a bagpipe on its ass, right?

730
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:07,088
Speaker 0: And I voiced that.

731
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:09,950
Speaker 0: It's like, that's not right.

732
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,834
Speaker 0: It's like that character should sound like a Scottish person.

733
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:13,335
Speaker 0: sounds.

734
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:22,890
Speaker 0: you get a Scottish person or someone who has studied the Scottish accent so well and practiced it so much that they are on.

735
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,850
Speaker 0: Think about which is probably going to be a Scottish person.

736
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:39,790
Speaker 1: It would take to be a voice actor who is acting not just a correct Scottish accent, but the correct Scottish accent of a character who is currently intoxicated as opposed to not intoxicated.

737
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:51,310
Speaker 1: Or even worse, what if you are voice acting an Englishman in a period drama who is trying to do and failing to do a fake Scottish accent because he is a spy?

738
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,609
Speaker 1: How good of a fucking voice actor do you have to be to pull that off?

739
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,147
Speaker 0: You have to.

740
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,170
Speaker 0: And then you're let's say you're a voice actor.

741
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,890
Speaker 0: You it's like, OK, you've learned the Scottish accent, right?

742
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,109
Speaker 0: Well, now you have to sing.

743
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,089
Speaker 0: And now you're right.

744
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:08,210
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, you're even a really simple scene, right?

745
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,130
Speaker 0: You're on a roller coaster and you have to scream.

746
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,090
Speaker 0: It's like scream like a Scottish person screams on a roller coaster.

747
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,570
Speaker 0: Fucking know that, right?

748
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:21,550
Speaker 0: It's like voice acting is so hard, right?

749
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,609
Speaker 0: It is this really hard job that doesn't pay enough.

750
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:26,230
Speaker 0: They got to work too hard, right?

751
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,468
Speaker 0: It's underappreciated, et cetera, et cetera.

752
00:53:30,392 --> 00:53:46,490
Speaker 0: And as we talked about in the news, most of the people producing dubs, right, especially for translated works, right, where they're producing a non native language dub, don't really give a shit about the quality.

753
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:52,910
Speaker 0: And it's to the point where this is the old dub subs debate.

754
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,009
Speaker 1: Well, where's the point to this day?

755
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:58,929
Speaker 1: If they if I hear if you put something out in the other room and don't let us see it.

756
00:53:59,992 --> 00:54:06,250
Speaker 1: Scott and I could with, I suspect, 100 percent accuracy tell you that it is one of three things.

757
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:08,829
Speaker 1: It is from an anime dub.

758
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:14,329
Speaker 1: It is from a video game or it is from something else that is more professionally done.

759
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:15,908
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

760
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:16,787
Speaker 0: Right.

761
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,869
Speaker 0: But if they don't care about the quality of it.

762
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:20,530
Speaker 0: Right.

763
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:25,630
Speaker 0: Even if I am listening to actors in a language I don't know.

764
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:26,195
Speaker 0: Right.

765
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:31,710
Speaker 0: You know, the original Japanese language or French language or whatever language the original language was.

766
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:39,970
Speaker 0: It's like whichever dub cast, the directors and the and the actors did the best job.

767
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:40,890
Speaker 0: Right.

768
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:54,630
Speaker 0: It's like you, as long as you're able to hear it, it's like they can get across the emotions better than even someone else doing a worse job in your native language.

769
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:55,629
Speaker 0: And that is why.

770
00:54:56,283 --> 00:54:56,450
Speaker 0: Right.

771
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,830
Speaker 0: I don't go for the subtitles because it must be the native language.

772
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,910
Speaker 0: I go for the subtitles because the acting is actually better.

773
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,650
Speaker 0: That production was the production that did the best job of voice.

774
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:15,710
Speaker 1: I mean, if I didn't have a job, I would try to learn languages of my favorite literature enough to read books in those native languages.

775
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:21,550
Speaker 0: But I'm saying if somebody came and told me right that there was an anime made in Japan and it was a great anime.

776
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:25,970
Speaker 0: And the original language of the anime was Japanese.

777
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,710
Speaker 0: But the Japanese voice actors fucking phoned it in and did a shit job.

778
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:33,869
Speaker 0: They they hired cheap actors who weren't any good.

779
00:55:34,036 --> 00:55:34,142
Speaker 0: Yeah.

780
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:38,790
Speaker 0: But that the Italian dub crew.

781
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:39,590
Speaker 0: Right.

782
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:41,209
Speaker 0: For the Italian audience.

783
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:41,930
Speaker 0: Right.

784
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,329
Speaker 0: Did an incredible job.

785
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,610
Speaker 1: I think I would watch it in Italian with English subtitles.

786
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:46,648
Speaker 0: I would.

787
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:48,770
Speaker 0: If I had that information available.

788
00:55:49,403 --> 00:55:49,550
Speaker 0: Right.

789
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,210
Speaker 0: And I knew that the English dub was also, you know, not not a high quality one.

790
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:56,750
Speaker 0: I would seek out the Italian dub.

791
00:55:56,878 --> 00:55:57,010
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:02,830
Speaker 0: I want it's like if you had a choice, like you're watching a movie or you can't do this with with regular live action movies.

793
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:12,470
Speaker 0: You can't be like, you know, you know, I would have really liked, you know, Star Wars better if instead of Mark Hamill, it was, you know, someone else.

794
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,019
Speaker 0: Right.

795
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,149
Speaker 0: Gilbert Gottfried.

796
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:15,305
Speaker 0: Right.

797
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:20,990
Speaker 0: It's like no matter what country you're in, if you got eyeballs and you watch Star Wars, there's you're looking at Mark Hamill.

798
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:21,849
Speaker 0: That's who you're looking at.

799
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,489
Speaker 0: You're not seeing anyone else up there.

800
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:24,690
Speaker 0: You can't change it out.

801
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,629
Speaker 0: But with voice acting, you can change it out.

802
00:56:27,171 --> 00:56:34,930
Speaker 0: And if one actor did a better job than another actor, you can go out and hear the better actor or actress instead.

803
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:40,490
Speaker 0: And why wouldn't you write if subtitles in your native language are available now?

804
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:50,090
Speaker 1: The other problem in the industry is, one, a lot of anime fans, just like everyone who plays video games, wants to make video games and they're willing to sacrifice a lot to do it.

805
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:56,430
Speaker 1: A lot of people who watch anime in the American anime fandom want to be voice actors because of the weird.

806
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:09,890
Speaker 1: I think it's mostly because of the weird ecosystem in America where the voice actors on anime are treated as bigger celebrities than they are in the context of conventions, which has led to a lot of weird outcomes.

807
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,649
Speaker 1: But I don't think we need to dwell on that.

808
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:13,810
Speaker 1: If you've been to anime cons, you know what I'm talking about.

809
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:21,790
Speaker 0: I think it is interesting that in Japan, it's like there definitely is a Seiyuu can become famous, right?

810
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,330
Speaker 0: It's like it's to the general public, it seems, right?

811
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,490
Speaker 0: It's like they're known people, right?

812
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:30,970
Speaker 0: Just like other actors are known, voice actors are also known quantities, right?

813
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:38,090
Speaker 0: In the United States and other parts of the world, it's like you could be the voice actor for something enormous, right?

814
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:43,210
Speaker 0: So they're hugely popular and be a complete unknown to everybody.

815
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,990
Speaker 0: People might know your voice when they hear it and never have heard of you, right?

816
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,590
Speaker 0: Nerds might know of some of these people, right?

817
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,746
Speaker 0: But the general public does not know, right?

818
00:57:52,370 --> 00:58:01,310
Speaker 0: The voices of major, major characters don't appear on late shows or walk red carpets.

819
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:14,270
Speaker 1: So one weird thing I've noticed, the people who do voice acting, who are not anime people, who get a treatment similar to the anime people, is basically anything that nerds care a lot about.

820
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:25,650
Speaker 1: So if a popular cartoon that has a presence at like the San Diego Comic Con, the voice actors in that show, every nerd knows who they are and they're treated like celebrities.

821
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:34,770
Speaker 1: But a super famous, important actor who does a voice in a movie that's animated, the nerds don't tend to get that way about them in America.

822
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:39,670
Speaker 1: But I think that says more about fan culture than about anything else.

823
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:45,748
Speaker 0: Right, I mean I was saying like if you look at something hugely popular, say Frozen, right?

824
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:47,630
Speaker 0: That's a mega hit, right?

825
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:52,365
Speaker 0: All the voice actors on that are also already famous people, right?

826
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:53,950
Speaker 0: On their own, right?

827
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:55,168
Speaker 0: So at least most of them are.

828
00:58:55,611 --> 00:59:00,190
Speaker 0: But if you look at The Simpsons, it's like, it's like, it's mega huge, right?

829
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,943
Speaker 0: It's like we know who the people are.

830
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,730
Speaker 1: Now, Simpsons nerds care a lot.

831
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:10,310
Speaker 0: No, nerds in general know, but the general public all would all know Homer Simpson's voice.

832
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,509
Speaker 0: Everybody, right?

833
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,489
Speaker 0: But if you said, "Alright, who's the voice of Homer

834
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:15,730
Speaker 0: Simpson?"

835
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:16,489
Speaker 0: They don't fucking know.

836
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,128
Speaker 0: If you told them that person's name, they'd be like, "I don't know who that

837
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:19,289
Speaker 0: is.".

838
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:21,878
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like there's.

839
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:28,130
Speaker 0: no, even at the top of the voice acting game in the United States, you don't get general public fame.

840
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:32,810
Speaker 0: You only get nerd fame, even outside of anime, right?

841
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:35,850
Speaker 0: Even outside of things that are important from other countries, right?

842
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:53,550
Speaker 0: So that's, it's that, like you said, when it comes to the nerds who do know, there becomes a weird culture around those people who are the voice actors because, right, it's like a special treat in a way for them to appear.

843
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:59,147
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, even though I don't give a shit about them, like when I go to conventions, when I did go to conventions, right?

844
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:08,950
Speaker 0: It is really fun to meet a voice actor and if they actually are so gracious enough to do the voice, despite people constantly grasping on to the voice.

845
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:09,708
Speaker 1: Say the line, Bart.

846
01:00:10,591 --> 01:00:13,550
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, it is entertaining, right?

847
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,830
Speaker 0: It is pleasurable, right?

848
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:18,330
Speaker 0: And they have that power with their, it's just, you know.

849
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,690
Speaker 1: It kind of breaks your brain a little bit.

850
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:29,216
Speaker 1: Like the few times I've been like talking directly to a voice actor and they slip into the character voice, there's this moment where the brain just goes, "What?

851
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:31,427
Speaker 1: How is that coming out of a human's mouth in front of me right

852
01:00:31,467 --> 01:00:31,648
Speaker 1: now?".

853
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:36,510
Speaker 1: Like there's this, it's slightly surprising, even if you see it coming and you know they're about to do it.

854
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,110
Speaker 0: It's the same thing you get when you, you know, see any talented person do their talented thing, right?

855
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,309
Speaker 0: You watch a basketball player do a ridiculous dunk.

856
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:50,189
Speaker 0: You watch a, you know, expert pianist, right, play a piano amazingly, right?

857
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,725
Speaker 0: You see a singer sing amazingly, right?

858
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:58,470
Speaker 0: And you see some person, right, do this voice, like holy shit, wow, right?

859
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,804
Speaker 0: It's like the same holy shit, wow kind of thing only, right?

860
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:07,287
Speaker 0: You know, if Lebron goes around the street, he doesn't have people saying, "Do a dunk, do a

861
01:01:07,307 --> 01:01:07,508
Speaker 0: dunk.".

862
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:08,162
Speaker 0: Right?

863
01:01:09,694 --> 01:01:11,110
Speaker 1: Right, but also people don't know who the hell he is.

864
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:11,609
Speaker 1: Tony Hawk!

865
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:17,590
Speaker 1: If anyone actually recognizes Tony Hawk, "Do a kickflip" is the first thing they will yell.

866
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:25,470
Speaker 1: It's basically, it's the freebird of seeing Tony Hawk and recognizing that's Tony Hawk.

867
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:38,410
Speaker 0: Right, you know, you know, people who have a talent of performing, other people want them to perform because they're so good at it that it brings joy to those who witness it and experience it.

868
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:47,170
Speaker 0: And I'll admit, if you're a voice actor and people are telling you to do the voice, right, all the time, if they know at the conventions, thankfully not when you're not at the conventions.

869
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:49,449
Speaker 1: I'll be honest, I would never get tired of that.

870
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:52,270
Speaker 0: On the one hand, it's annoying, right?

871
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:59,950
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, it's like that is recognition that your voice is so amazing that people want to hear it.

872
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:02,889
Speaker 0: So it's like a good and a bad at the same time.

873
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:06,210
Speaker 1: Even our tiny, like, ageless level of fame.

874
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:12,310
Speaker 1: When we were going to conventions, how many people come up to us like, "You just did a panel about bad games for an hour.

875
01:02:12,932 --> 01:02:15,707
Speaker 1: I would like you to tell me why my game is bad right

876
01:02:15,747 --> 01:02:15,868
Speaker 1: now.".

877
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,958
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "Because your face is bad.

878
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:18,762
Speaker 1: Get out of here,

879
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:18,963
Speaker 1: kid.".

880
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,062
Speaker 0: "Because I don't like your

881
01:02:21,082 --> 01:02:21,306
Speaker 0: face.".

882
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:21,731
Speaker 1: But

883
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:22,453
Speaker 0: I actually,

884
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:39,530
Speaker 1: it's funny, the only voice actors that I can just name off the top of my head are ones that either I know because I'm a nerd who pays a lot of attention to something specific or they're nerdy pop culture things that are hard to avoid, mostly from eras when I was really into that.

885
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:55,330
Speaker 1: And I've seen a lot of anime with fantastic voice acting and yet I don't remember the names of any of those people anymore even though I watched one episode of Escaflowne and then I was trying to learn more about Miyasakamoto.

886
01:02:55,892 --> 01:03:00,810
Speaker 1: But I think that's just because I'm older and I have less time to spend on frivolous pursuits.

887
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:18,290
Speaker 0: So there's one last phenomena that I've noticed a bit over time which is there'll be famous people who are not necessarily voice actors, right?

888
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:25,929
Speaker 1: Ah, but they get attached to an animated movie usually because then they can say their name like "Gilbert Gottfried is in this

889
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:26,110
Speaker 1: movie.".

890
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,058
Speaker 0: That's not what I'm talking about.

891
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:28,410
Speaker 0: That's not what I'm talking about at all.

892
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:34,983
Speaker 0: But they have a distinctive voice that is known, right?

893
01:03:35,264 --> 01:03:37,430
Speaker 0: Or that you've heard that voice somewhere.

894
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:38,389
Speaker 1: Well, like Thunder Throat.

895
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:41,730
Speaker 0: Sure, rest in peace that guy.

896
01:03:44,811 --> 01:03:53,950
Speaker 0: And they'll get gigs voice acting on shows usually as cameos or as other characters or something like that, right?

897
01:03:54,430 --> 01:04:00,650
Speaker 0: So, for example, you could watch a lot of children's cartoons and it's like you'll be surprised.

898
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:03,390
Speaker 0: Weird Al just shows up a lot, right?

899
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:07,069
Speaker 0: It's like if you aren't thinking about it really hard.

900
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,489
Speaker 1: I mean, he was in My Little Pony.

901
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:19,689
Speaker 0: Right, if you're not thinking about it hard or aware of it in advance or it's like you just hear someone doing a voice and then it's like, "Wait a minute, that's the Weird Al

902
01:04:19,709 --> 01:04:19,890
Speaker 0: voice.".

903
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,896
Speaker 0: No, that is Weird Al doing that voice.

904
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:26,609
Speaker 0: He got hired to do voice acting on that show for one episode as that one character.

905
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:41,828
Speaker 1: Sometimes you get the situation with like a Lorenzo music where there's someone who sounds close enough to a well-known voice, in this case Bill Murray, that people hire this person to basically make people think they heard Bill Murray.

906
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:45,749
Speaker 0: Kind of.

907
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, that happens though.

908
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:47,789
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

909
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:50,777
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the Thunder Throat guy died.

910
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:54,530
Speaker 0: I've heard movie trailers recently where it sounds really similar.

911
01:04:55,270 --> 01:05:01,429
Speaker 1: So, that actually leads into the last topic I wanted to bring up and we'll have to wrap up soon because important hockey is going to start in 15 minutes.

912
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:18,150
Speaker 1: But voice acting faster than a lot of other acting, I'm not going to say is going to be made obsolete, but technology can replace low-quality voice acting pretty easily.

913
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,890
Speaker 1: Deep fakes.

914
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:19,677
Speaker 0: Low quality?

915
01:05:19,718 --> 01:05:20,529
Speaker 0: Yes, very much.

916
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:21,010
Speaker 1: Yep.

917
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:33,449
Speaker 1: So, the things that are going to happen in this industry that we have to deal with is people who are dead or retired or who for moral reasons refuse to work on a show, let's say.

918
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:40,630
Speaker 1: Deep fakes could just perfectly recreate their voice, good enough for a voice acting gig, and someone else does the performance.

919
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,910
Speaker 1: And it just sounds like that person did the performance.

920
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,010
Speaker 0: It depends on if you own the rights to like your likeness, right?

921
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:49,698
Speaker 0: So, like just today.

922
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:56,050
Speaker 1: There are already big debates around what actually fully constitutes a likeness or not.

923
01:05:57,556 --> 01:05:57,860
Speaker 1: Of course.

924
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:02,850
Speaker 1: I don't want to look like Bill Murray, but what if I just happen to sound exactly like Bill Murray?

925
01:06:03,892 --> 01:06:05,288
Speaker 0: Well, like I was saying, just today, right?

926
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:13,790
Speaker 1: You know, Stan Lee in his latest years- What if I train a model on Lorenzo Music's voice to then recreate Bill Murray's voice indirectly?

927
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, Stan Lee in his very latest years, right?

928
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:25,010
Speaker 0: There was all sorts of fiascos involving elder abuse and whatnot and signing contracts without, you know, forging a signature on stuff, right?

929
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:34,090
Speaker 0: But just today, literally, Disney paid the company that was, you know, the one that forged the signatures or whatever, right?

930
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:38,430
Speaker 0: Stan Lee's company to license for like many, many years.

931
01:06:38,611 --> 01:06:39,450
Speaker 0: I think it was 20 years.

932
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:39,842
Speaker 0: Look up.

933
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:42,850
Speaker 0: There'll be articles about it today, about how many years this deal was.

934
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:47,490
Speaker 0: They licensed from Stan Lee's POW Entertainment, whatever it's called, right?

935
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:59,890
Speaker 0: His, you know, likeness, right, for a large amount of time so that they can basically recreate a Stan Lee in whatever Marvel shit they want to recreate him in, right?

936
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:10,350
Speaker 0: And if they have a way to make a computer talk like Stan Lee or, you know, sell a GPS voice Stan Lee for your car GPS or, you know, they're going to do it.

937
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:11,809
Speaker 0: They got the license for it.

938
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:12,710
Speaker 0: They're going to do it, right?

939
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:21,150
Speaker 0: So, if someone tries to sound like you and you're a famous voice, you know, get the - make sure that, you know, you get a licensing deal for that shit.

940
01:07:22,294 --> 01:07:22,404
Speaker 1: Yep.

941
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:39,850
Speaker 1: But also, that'll all be moot because we're going to get to the point to where much like with, you know, motion capture and everything else, even if we have a person doing the acting, we will very likely see increasingly heavily computer modulated performances that come out of that acting.

942
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:45,144
Speaker 1: So then, no longer does the original actor really have control over that?

943
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:46,668
Speaker 1: because what's the voice the audience hears?

944
01:07:46,748 --> 01:07:47,470
Speaker 1: and what's the likeness?

945
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,630
Speaker 1: It's the AI generated audio.

946
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,489
Speaker 1: You've just got someone basically working the controls behind it.

947
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:54,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, could be, could be.

948
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,590
Speaker 0: Okay, I just want to end the show by mentioning that there is a book that's been on my wish list that I haven't read yet.

949
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:07,570
Speaker 0: I don't know if it'll be Geek Nights Book Club material, but famous voice actress Megumi Hashibara wrote a whole fucking book.

950
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:14,490
Speaker 0: She wrote a whole book called The Characters Taught Me Everything Living Life One Episode at a Time, and it's been on my wish list.

951
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,279
Speaker 1: Oh, that sounds so good.

952
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,069
Speaker 1: I'm really invested in that already.

953
01:08:18,691 --> 01:08:27,430
Speaker 0: It's got five stars and it's on Amazon and it's got, it's 17 bucks for this book and I've been meaning, it's been on my wish list.

954
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:40,950
Speaker 0: I've been meaning to read it whenever and that book exists and that book can probably tell you a lot about the life of voice acting, right, from one of the, you know, the S-tier stars of voice acting of all, you know, time.

955
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:48,750
Speaker 1: And I don't know if you ever, if you ever need me and Scott to voice act for you, all I can say is what you hear now, that's the only voice either of us can do.

956
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:55,870
Speaker 0: If you want to hire me to voice act, you'll have to wait for me to join the voice acting union and then you can hire me through the union.

957
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:03,669
Speaker 0: If you somehow like my voice that much and can't find an actor to actually do it and you're aware of the fact that I have no acting skills.

958
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:05,955
Speaker 1: That's something I'd be willing to do without joining a union.

959
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:11,050
Speaker 1: If we got the valiant denim team back together for one last episode.

960
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:12,089
Speaker 0: That seems unlikely.

961
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,950
Speaker 1: That seems extremely un, uh, possible.

962
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,527
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

963
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:28,540
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

964
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,939

965
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,888
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

966
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:41,120
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

967

Speaker 0: Geek Nights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

968
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,490
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

969
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,580
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

970
01:09:52,841 --> 01:10:30,140
Speaker 1: And the Patreon Patreons for this episode of Geek Nights are... Uh, I wonder if any of you thought I was going to try to do an accent or a weird voice for this, but I absolutely am.

971
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:35,140
Speaker 1: This is hard enough to do as it is to read all these names that quickly, let alone to do it in a weird voice.

972
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:41,720
Speaker 1: So other than one brave person who appears to have typed it out in an accent, this is all you're getting.

973
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,576
Speaker 1: So, uh, all I leave you with is...

974
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,579
Speaker 0: La granuit, mons le pamplemousse.

975
01:10:47,902 --> 01:10:48,515
Speaker 0: La granuit!

976
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:54,199
Speaker 1: This isn't Miss Hoover's class.

977
01:10:54,903 --> 01:10:58,500
Speaker 1: Uh, do not know this mad monselle, ouvert, of which you speak.

978
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:00,009
Speaker 0: What's happening?

979
01:11:00,373 --> 01:11:01,039
Speaker 0: Where am I?

980
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,426
Speaker 0: Sacre bleu!

981
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:04,280
Speaker 0: What a foolish question!

982
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,259
Speaker 1: You're at West Springfield Elementary School!

983
01:11:08,141 --> 01:11:09,200
Speaker 1: West Springfield?

984
01:11:11,025 --> 01:11:12,658
Speaker 0: I'm at the wrong school!

985
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:16,672
Speaker 0: En français!

986
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:19,935
Speaker 1: Bonjour!
