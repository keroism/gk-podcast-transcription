1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,638
Speaker 0: It's Monday September 30th 2019 on rim, I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:21,080
Speaker 0: tonight We are back from a kind of long hiatus to bring you the global positioning system.

3
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:22,998
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:32,716
Speaker 0: So we uh We had a hiatus because of conventions and travel and all this stuff and then we tax.

5
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:40,320
Speaker 0: that's already beginning of September And it's already October like tomorrow And this is already the season where traditionally we tend to have a lot of disruptions to geek nights.

6
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:48,708
Speaker 0: But as you may have heard or noticed we had a much more significant disruption for than usual Because Scott has a new fancy apartment.

7
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:50,092
Speaker 1: I moved down the street.

8
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:51,335
Speaker 1: It took a while.

9
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:52,880
Speaker 1: I got a lot of nerdy shit.

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,783
Speaker 1: It's hard to move.

11
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:54,786
Speaker 0: moving sucks.

12
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,191
Speaker 0: I when you were talking about moving.

13
00:00:56,251 --> 00:01:02,894
Speaker 0: I literally was having flashbacks to us trying to get out of beacon From the movers, it was pretty easy for me.

14
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:07,773
Speaker 1: Yeah But uh, well you hired three shady Russian do Eastern European dudes.

15
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:08,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, they weren't Russian.

16
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,680
Speaker 0: They were Georgian, right?

17
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,711
Speaker 1: but I Hired fancy moving company.

18
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:20,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was much more Like if I if and when I ever my head and have hired that fancy moving company to do this move.

19
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:28,206
Speaker 0: I would have been fine If I ever move again from this apartment to anywhere even like in the side can recommend the fancy moving company Which they were great.

20
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:28,990
Speaker 0: I was looking at.

21
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:30,840
Speaker 0: I was looking at the prices for this.

22
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:38,653
Speaker 0: It's not as expensive as I expected but it is expensive The div to pay a moving company that doesn't just move the stuff you packed.

23
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:47,280
Speaker 0: they come into your apartment pack everything Oh, yeah And unpack it all according to your specifications while you're on vacation.

24
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,510
Speaker 1: The one that we hired would offer those services.

25
00:01:51,012 --> 00:02:02,455
Speaker 1: We did not pay for the pack our stuff service But basically when they showed up my stuff was as packed as I could pack it They came in and they basically packed it further of their own.

26
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:03,238
Speaker 0: it's amazing.

27
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,869
Speaker 0: like you think Oh, I did a good job of packing this stuff.

28
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,300
Speaker 0: Then you watch a professional take your shit.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,697
Speaker 1: Yes, it took me like all like a whole week to pack up what I packed.

30
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,271
Speaker 1: in an hour They emptied my apartment of everything.

31
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:16,177
Speaker 1: I wanted out of there.

32
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:21,279
Speaker 0: Yep How long did it take us to move all our shit out of that truck into the house and beacon like a day?

33
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:32,860
Speaker 1: It was just to get boxes from a truck Company that I hired would pack your stuff right bring it and then unpack it if you paid them more monies.

34
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:37,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I ever move again, I'm just gonna leave my apartment and expect you come home to my new apartment.

35
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, like after a vacation.

36
00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:40,509
Speaker 1: They will do that for you.

37
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,074
Speaker 0: Yeah moving socks.

38
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:43,719
Speaker 0: I've stayed in this apartment for almost 10 years.

39
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,918
Speaker 0: I don't plan to leave anytime soon because it is rent stabilized.

40
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:51,288
Speaker 0: So There is a ton of news.

41
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:54,318
Speaker 0: a ton has happened in the tech world.

42
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:58,150
Speaker 1: in the world We have a huge pile of stuff and we forgot most of it.

43
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,299
Speaker 1: because when we open up our computers to say What are we gonna talk about today?

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,880
Speaker 1: All the websites have recent things and unless you tag and save a whole bunch of older thing Which

45
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,426
Speaker 0: we do not do because as you know geek

46
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,674
Speaker 1: nights, I do it a little bit

47
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:22,018
Speaker 0: we do zero Pre-production we do like a Minutes worth of semi-automated post-production and we go live to tape meaning we don't even edit.

48
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,129
Speaker 1: so So yeah, basically all the good stuff.

49
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,980
Speaker 1: We could have talked about in the past month or whatever.

50
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,044
Speaker 1: We're not gonna.

51
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:30,285
Speaker 1: we're gonna.

52
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:33,155
Speaker 1: good news is the one of the opening bits just lost into the wind.

53
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:36,892
Speaker 1: Yep, cheers Somebody so many things of the day.

54
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:38,439
Speaker 1: just you'll have to find them on your own.

55
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:45,100
Speaker 0: I'd quote Roy Batty because actually one thing that Emily and I just watched that we hadn't seen until last night was Blade Runner 2049.

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,508
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't see that.

57
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,016
Speaker 0: It's real fucking good.

58
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:48,820
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is.

59
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:55,040
Speaker 1: The thing is I want to rewatch I guess figure out which old edit of the original blade.

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,540
Speaker 0: Yes, a rewatch the old Blade Runner again first if it is not fresh in your mind.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,150
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it was fresh in my mind.

62
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:02,620
Speaker 1: It's half fresh in my mind.

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,580
Speaker 0: It was fresh in my mind because I watched it again on a plane.

64
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:13,305
Speaker 0: I could tell you the plot because I was thinking a lot about being puppycat and I want I could actually name one character Roy Batty and Deckard.

65
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:14,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, those ones.

66
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:15,632
Speaker 0: Can you name anyone else?

67
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,435
Speaker 0: No, Rachel.

68
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,980
Speaker 1: I guess that's her name.

69
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:22,140
Speaker 0: I can't name all the other goons like all the all the sub bosses and such.

70
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,260
Speaker 0: No, I can't name that many other characters.

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,840
Speaker 0: But uh, all I will say for Blade Runner 2049 which kind of relevant to Monday gig nights.

72
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:31,835
Speaker 0: I'm sure sure when you watch it we can do a show on it.

73
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,360
Speaker 0: Is that one?

74
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:46,890
Speaker 0: If you don't know anything about it, like you don't know what the plot is do not read anything about it just going cold Having watched the original Blade Runner because it is basically a direct sequel And it is yeah, like it's the same year.

75
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,228
Speaker 1: does original Blade Runner take place in like 20 20 something like it's.

76
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,840
Speaker 0: it's 20 to 30 years after that movie.

77
00:04:53,961 --> 00:05:01,820
Speaker 0: Okay, arguably depending on how you look at it But it's it's in that same timeline - it basically has three acts because it's three hours long.

78
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:03,105
Speaker 1: That's my kind of move.

79
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:03,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

80
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,520
Speaker 0: It is long and slow in the way that you will love.

81
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, give me that long fucking movie three.

82
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:17,259
Speaker 0: It is in every conceivable way a Worthy successor to Blade Runner without just being Blade Runner again.

83
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:27,795
Speaker 0: like when I think of that movie and I think of Blade Runner, I feel like they're equally worthy as Blade Runner movies and When you say it you see it.

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:44,179
Speaker 0: So of all the news we could talk about the one thing that we have to say something about Is the fact that the week we happen to not do geek nights happened to be the week that the entire US government entered Possibly one of its literally greatest crises.

85
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:52,748
Speaker 0: We are in the process of impeaching the president of the United States like literally it's moving so fast I don't even feel like I can talk about it.

86
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,560
Speaker 0: a bunch of breaking news happen between When I looked at the news at work and when we started recording the show.

87
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:03,480
Speaker 0: So all I'll say is that if you do not leave in the United States, basically, you're very lucky.

88
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I don't know what's gonna happen.

89
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,420
Speaker 0: But if we fail to impeach this president our government is basically failed and I don't know what happens after that.

90
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:24,538
Speaker 1: Like I said before the show and the microphone wasn't on it's like in civilization When the little partisan shows up outside the city makes a little gun noise like ticket ticket ticket, you know Like a big red flag.

91
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,407
Speaker 0: Yep, it's like.

92
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:33,597
Speaker 0: wait those look like barbarian units But they're way powerful and there's like five of them and that city is nearly not producing anything.

93
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:34,400
Speaker 1: What's up with that?

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,825
Speaker 1: Yep, how come no one's going to work?

95
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:38,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, how come I don't have any military over by that city.

96
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:39,119
Speaker 0: What's going on?

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,779
Speaker 0: Oh now that city is just a barbarian city WTF?

98
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:54,420
Speaker 0: But the way you are the barbarian city the way this goes down and I'm also kind of aiming this at Americans because I've realized Most people don't actually know how impeachment works because hasn't happened that many times?

99
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,180
Speaker 1: I knew how it worked since eighth grade when we had the Constitution.

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,020
Speaker 1: I had enough brain to understand it.

101
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:09,880
Speaker 0: Our government has three co-equal branches and one of those branches has two Co-equal bodies that have suddenly different mandates and responsibilities.

102
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:12,834
Speaker 0: So in our Congress, we have the House and the Senate.

103
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:20,380
Speaker 0: the house Has is Responsible for and this is like, you know, you talk about like what are the powers of government and what's up?

104
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,164
Speaker 1: Just lay this up.

105
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,293
Speaker 1: Do you really need to teach it to them?

106
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:23,119
Speaker 0: I feel like we do.

107
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:25,813
Speaker 0: It's like rule one of the Constitution

108
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:30,567
Speaker 1: House says yes We're gonna impeach and if they vote yes Then the Senate actually does the

109
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:39,218
Speaker 0: trial and the trial it ends either in But literally the removal from office of the president and or vice president or not or nothing

110
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:39,740
Speaker 1: or nothing.

111
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:48,221
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it is a fair like there is no debate about the constitutionality of how this works like Supreme Court has no say In this.

112
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,789
Speaker 1: well, this is the this debate.

113
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,640
Speaker 1: There's a lot of leeway in terms of okay, the Senate will have a trial.

114
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,169
Speaker 1: How does it conduct this trial?

115
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,160
Speaker 1: the Senate just fucking decides how to have the trial?

116
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,573
Speaker 0: Yes with one with one important caveat.

117
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:06,160
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't know I don't think definitely you even know this who presides over the trial Supreme Court justice.

118
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:22,291
Speaker 0: So if it's chief justice of the spring if it's an impeachment of anyone but the president Fucking like Mitch McConnell would do it only because it is the president himself Does it mean that it would be the chief justice of the Supreme Court, right?

119
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:26,585
Speaker 0: Just he walks on over but there's no appeal There's no lawsuit.

120
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:27,468
Speaker 0: It is it.

121
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,271
Speaker 0: it is literally.

122
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:38,807
Speaker 0: if they vote like impeachment and then they confirm it Is the immediate and automatic removal from office in the permanent lifetime ban with no recourse Yeah from any public office.

123
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:40,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, well, it's a pretty high bar.

124
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,100
Speaker 1: You need a two-thirds vote.

125
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:43,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and like.

126
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:44,313
Speaker 1: it's.

127
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:44,515
Speaker 1: like.

128
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:51,077
Speaker 1: it's like yeah If you're that bad that they effectively had enough votes to amend the Constitution to get rid of you.

129
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:51,699
Speaker 1: You're out.

130
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's a. it's enough votes to amend the Constitution to kick you out.

131
00:08:56,781 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 1: So that basically is the equivalent of writing an amendment in the Constitution that says rim cannot be president.

132
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, like yeah, okay.

133
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:11,880
Speaker 1: If that if the if the country hates you that much or you're that bad that you got that many no votes then yeah.

134
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:21,000
Speaker 0: But the reason this is such a big deal then we'll move on cuz I don't want to dwell on this is simply that There's a big difference between talking about impeachment or having investigations or hearing in the u.s.

135
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:26,335
Speaker 0: Versus the house formally saying we are drafting articles of impeachment.

136
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:34,700
Speaker 0: as soon as they do that No one can avoid answering their questions because not answering their questions is itself worthy of impeachment.

137
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,133
Speaker 0: So it's a tricky situation.

138
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,440
Speaker 0: That's gonna be really interesting.

139
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:42,299
Speaker 0: The entire fate of the US government hinges on like the next two or three weeks.

140
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:55,980
Speaker 0: So, uh, the reason I think this is funny the other thing I was alluding to is that While we were on the hiatus because Scott couldn't do shows while he was moving You might have noticed that I started making a whole bunch of YouTube videos and patreon things.

141
00:09:56,481 --> 00:10:00,012
Speaker 0: But as a result of that I listened to a lot of old episodes of geek nights.

142
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:05,628
Speaker 0: partially like to find that like to find the main bit in these old episodes of geek nights.

143
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:16,656
Speaker 0: and if you listen to the news for geek nights between like 2005 and 2009 to 2010 ish we talk a lot about politics every fucking episode.

144
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:17,560

159
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:03,680
Speaker 1: that's the only thing I remember from brave story is the circus.

160
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:04,839
Speaker 0: Oh, you saw the wind.

161
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:11,500
Speaker 0: I Listened to our 10-minute review of this movie where you and I talked about a lot of details of this movie.

162
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,748
Speaker 0: I literally do not remember this movie.

163
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,273
Speaker 0: I went into why do you remember?

164
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,400
Speaker 1: there were some anime movies with wind in the title?

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,531
Speaker 0: I went and watched sections of it.

166
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:20,980
Speaker 0: I still do not remember this.

167
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,048
Speaker 0: I remember nothing about it yet.

168
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:24,995
Speaker 0: We did a long-form review of it.

169
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:34,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay But this episode of geek nights was 10 minutes of us reviewing this anime and like 40 minutes of us talking about politics.

170
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,920
Speaker 0: So in some actual technology news, that's pretty important.

171
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:48,300
Speaker 0: RMS Richard Stallman who is most Notable for eating something that he picked off of his own foot while on a panel.

172
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:49,645
Speaker 1: Well, he wasn't on a panel.

173
00:11:49,685 --> 00:12:03,172
Speaker 1: He was like lecturing in front of a classroom sitting in a chair with his second Whole room of people looking at him and he takes off his shoe and his sock and he picks something off his foot and he Eats it and swallows it suppose.

174
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:04,378
Speaker 1: I guess I can't tell.

175
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:08,658
Speaker 1: yeah It's anyway, so RMS if you don't know we can't.

176
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:08,920
Speaker 1: you know.

177
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,860
Speaker 1: If you want to learn a lot about this person you can with the internet.

178
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,412
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's worth your time But basically it was a person who had a large hand in.

179
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:29,558
Speaker 1: you know, the open source software movement you know made Emacs type things and You know was the head of the free software foundation was the person who would pedantically argue about.

180
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,927
Speaker 1: it's not Linux It's new Linux.

181
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the new herd and all right.

182
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,868
Speaker 1: Well, the new herd was like the kernel they wanted to make.

183
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:39,760
Speaker 1: yeah not to be like not use Linux, but that never got anywhere.

184
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,428
Speaker 0: You know like you would beef even with Linus Torvalds.

185
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,531
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is just.

186
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:50,482
Speaker 1: he was uh, you know, basically the classic right That guy.

187
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:53,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you know beard a beard.

188
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,480
Speaker 0: Oh Unix II guy who has really strong opinions and is super toxic to work with.

189
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,880
Speaker 1: It was notoriously bad dude, right?

190
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,139
Speaker 1: So what happened?

191
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,549
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it was what happened recently.

192
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,820
Speaker 1: was there was the whole deal with like Epstein the pedophile, right?

193
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:23,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he made some comments regarding Minsky which is a related person in that whole fiasco and regardless of the specifics of those comments because His comments were like, you know that guy ish, you know I'm not gonna get an argument about the right.

194
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:28,040
Speaker 0: the point is I would say RMS is like the archetypical that guy, right?

195
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:38,497
Speaker 1: Everyone came out of the woodwork with like, all right, we haven't paid attention to you in a long time And in the time since we stopped paying attention to you me too is a thing.

196
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:43,816
Speaker 1: by the way Here's a million stories or a million people about how much of a disgusting human being you are like.

197
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:52,084
Speaker 0: you've been a problem For the open source community for as long as anyone has known your name right beside the foot eating and these other that guy tendencies.

198
00:13:52,144 --> 00:14:00,933
Speaker 1: it's like oh, yeah, we forgot about you, but you're awful and Basically he has been good and well pushed out of like every position he had.

199
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:05,407
Speaker 1: I think I was like a visiting professor at like MIT or something.

200
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, he resigned from that.

201
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,378
Speaker 0: He resigned from the FSF.

202
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:35,579
Speaker 1: Yep so I just wanna you know the related, you know lesson to learn from this is You know something I've learned recently because you know and on there's always an ongoing discussion about like Oh the great Pete the awful people who do great stuff, right, you know, but I heard you know There's always been like the same talking points in that discussion, right which is like Oh appreciate the thing the person did even though while at the same time, you know You recognize the person was bad and stuff like that, right?

203
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:50,040
Speaker 1: But I heard a point recently which is like, you know with only regards to if the person is still alive You know should you you know, cancel quote cancel them push them out, you know, get rid of them right ostracize them.

204
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,185
Speaker 0: Yes,

205
00:14:51,486 --> 00:15:09,142
Speaker 1: right, but the reason that the argument I think Undisputable argument for why you should do this is you know, people will say well well, but wait you're gonna push this person out You're gonna miss out on you know, this genius who's who's doing all this great work You're gonna you know, even though they're an awful person You're gonna miss out on all the great stuff They do.

206
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:19,939
Speaker 1: if you kick that, you know that pro athlete off your team You're gonna miss out on all their home runs and it's like yeah But if that person is so disgusting and abhorrent how many people are there?

207
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:29,020
Speaker 1: that would be contributing and maybe coming to hit Rome runs for your team who Refused to come because they don't want to play with that disgusting human being.

208
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:42,189
Speaker 1: how many people didn't go and write code at MIT or go into computer science because There's this disgusting RMS guy walking around eating shit off his feet and that makes them go like well, I'll go somewhere else I don't need to be here right?

209
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,640
Speaker 1: you're losing all those people.

210
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Speaker 1: So whether it's art or technology or whatever it is your field, right?

211
00:15:48,403 --> 00:16:01,920
Speaker 1: You even if someone truly is a genius which I don't think RMS really is no But you know if you have a person like that around even if they are a genius How many people are now not being around?

212
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:02,771
Speaker 1: Right.

213
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:12,309
Speaker 0: Yeah What would Linux on the desktop have looked like if like a lot more people with a lot more varied opinions were contributing to open Source and weren't driven away by this shit, right?

214
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:18,175
Speaker 1: So whatever he did it's like yeah I think we would have been okay without this dude and he was a bad dude.

215
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:20,645
Speaker 1: and we finally remembered Oh, yeah, that's a bad dude.

216
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:24,640
Speaker 1: Hey, no, so if you can think of any other dudes, right?

217
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,480
Speaker 0: Like for example in the voice acting community Vic like we're getting rid of him, right?

218
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:36,231
Speaker 1: It seems like every time there's a story about a bad dude who needs getting rid of it's always like oh, yeah Have you would have just told me he was a bad dude.

219
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:37,380
Speaker 1: I totally would have believed you.

220
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,820
Speaker 1: Right now you show me Bridget still I don't even need any evidence to know.

221
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,380
Speaker 1: I just know cuz I know that dude and I can just tell he is that vibe.

222
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:49,567
Speaker 1: but it's like I sit here and I try to think now and I'm like I should be proactive and try to think.

223
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:53,100
Speaker 1: what dudes do I remember that give off that vibe?

224
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and it's like I try to think of some and it's like I can't think of any but we definitely didn't get them All.

225
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,288
Speaker 1: no, right.

226
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,000
Speaker 1: It's like so everyone.

227
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,781
Speaker 1: I want everyone to think real hard about dudes who give off a bad vibe Where.

228
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:10,373
Speaker 1: if you heard in the news tomorrow that that was a bad dude, right?

229
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,760
Speaker 1: That should be quote canceled.

230
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,257
Speaker 1: You would have been like, oh, yeah, obviously that guy.

231
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,599
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, right, but try to think of those dudes now so that we can cancel them faster.

232
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,865
Speaker 1: We don't remember them.

233
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,069
Speaker 1: I just a memory.

234
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,133
Speaker 1: I saw an anime.

235
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:24,915
Speaker 1: I can't remember.

236
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,040
Speaker 1: I also can't remember.

237
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,279
Speaker 1: I Need someone else to help me remember the bad dudes.

238
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:52,820
Speaker 0: So in some other technology news if you haven't been following this it is kind of a big deal Irrespective of your feelings on smoking which is disgusting and vaping which is disgusting and you can tell what our opinions are on these things, but There is a big problem going on with the vaping industry and it's dangerous and it's killing people.

239
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:58,180
Speaker 0: Like if you vape I would suggest that you stop for the time being.

240
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:05,268
Speaker 0: Maybe talk to your doc like if you're vaping nicotine juice Because you're trying to quit smoking.

241
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,399
Speaker 0: smoking like talk to your doctor and figure out what you should do.

242
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:09,968
Speaker 0: But maybe you can.

243
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,059
Speaker 1: can you like just put water in a vape and vape?

244
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,564
Speaker 0: No No, no.

245
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:13,826
Speaker 0: No.

246
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:15,112
Speaker 0: So here's the God.

247
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:15,434
Speaker 0: Okay.

248
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:16,660
Speaker 0: I'm glad I'm doing this then.

249
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:17,666
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

250
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,225
Speaker 1: if you just cuz you some people have like, you know They're not like.

251
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,002
Speaker 1: actually addicted to Nick I mean are.

252
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,880
Speaker 1: a lot of people dig to nicotine know they get addicted to the ritual, right?

253
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:34,920
Speaker 1: But there are people were just addicted I know to at least partially to just like, you know The ritual and affectation of like putting something in your mouth like a pacifier or going outside and taking a break.

254
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:44,200
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah studies show that nicotine addiction goes away pretty quick compared to the like Other like habitual addiction to the rituals around smoking, right?

255
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,842
Speaker 1: So it's like.

256
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:50,344
Speaker 1: I feel like if you could just put like a nothing in the vape that would actually now So the products of some people.

257
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:52,189
Speaker 0: so the problem is the nothing.

258
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,413
Speaker 0: so here's the deal.

259
00:18:53,794 --> 00:19:03,700
Speaker 1: when you vape from these vaporizers It's basically a coil that heats up some juice sort of like the little the lighter in the in the in there in your car.

260
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the electric coil.

261
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:08,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's in some juice and it vaporizes that juicy and inhale it.

262
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:12,240
Speaker 0: It's not water vapor because for a lot of reasons.

263
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,960
Speaker 0: Well, I would just electrify like to turn or to turn to heat water to the point that you get a vapor out of it.

264
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,611
Speaker 0: That's gonna be too hot to just inhale into your lungs.

265
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, inhaling steam.

266
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:22,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's bad idea.

267
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,584
Speaker 1: And if you made a cold vape hello Legionnaires disease Okay.

268
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:27,785
Speaker 1: Yeah.

269
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:28,187
Speaker 1: Okay.

270
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,220
Speaker 1: Yep, but also you got to get the chemical that vapes at the right temp.

271
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:35,860
Speaker 0: But also people vape either flavor or nicotine or THC.

272
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:37,863
Speaker 0: All

273
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:40,560
Speaker 1: three of those things or come or combinations of all the

274
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:56,200
Speaker 0: Combination of all three all three of those things need a solvent to be able to be put into so that when that when you vape them the salt the Phenols and the chemicals and all these things can get into your mouth and lungs to taste and/or experience effects based on them.

275
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,126
Speaker 0: Can't just use water for that.

276
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:01,580
Speaker 0: if you don't understand why I suggest you take a high school chemistry class.

277
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:08,020
Speaker 0: But basically there are not that many kinds of solvents or kinds of things.

278
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,250
Speaker 0: You can put other things into solution with my.

279
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:16,864
Speaker 1: so even if you see if you find a chemical that vapes It might not be a solvent that you can dissolve Nicotine.

280
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:21,060
Speaker 1: or maybe you found a solvent you can dissolve nicotine into but oh it won't vape.

281
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:35,913
Speaker 0: Also those phenols and things themselves Like thus should say a phenol chemical that is cherry flavor That is generally recognized as safe meaning the FDA said yeah You can just put this in food and there's really no evidence that it hurts anyone.

282
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,037
Speaker 0: so kind of go nuts with it.

283
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:43,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but That doesn't mean that it's safe to vaporize and inhale into your lungs.

284
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:51,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, here's a specific example of that if you Inhale an oil like vitamin E for example into your lungs.

285
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:58,211
Speaker 0: You can get something called lipoid pneumonia Lipoid yeah, well depending on did.

286
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,160
Speaker 0: I've heard I've already heard professionals pronouncing this both ways.

287
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,937
Speaker 1: Okay, but the deal it cuz I mean lawyers can't even decide if it's pled or plead guilty.

288
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:11,932
Speaker 0: Yeah What about the original form of ouster and how that's actually the correct?

289
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:15,779
Speaker 0: it's not the ousting of it's the ouster of for reasons I don't want to get into.

290
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,627
Speaker 1: You didn't know that I had not heard that one.

291
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:20,693
Speaker 0: really how that's like.

292
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:24,640
Speaker 0: ouster is like front and center Impeachment is an ouster.

293
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:33,288
Speaker 0: Anyway, so if you inhale oils into your lungs as opposed to other things your lungs Do not have a whale to do.

294
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:34,494
Speaker 0: what we have to deal with that shit.

295
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,540
Speaker 0: It is super dangerous.

296
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,282
Speaker 0: It can kill you.

297
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:43,766
Speaker 0: that is why a lot of drugs that say things like if you overdose do not under any Circumstances try to vomit it up.

298
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:47,080
Speaker 0: go to a hospital because they need to get it out of you in a safe way.

299
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:52,159
Speaker 0: If you vomit it up even aspirating a little bit of it could literally kill you.

300
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:55,558
Speaker 1: Cuz I already hit the acid in your stomach and now it's like right.

301
00:21:56,403 --> 00:22:00,020
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you could get acid into your lungs, which is that's also really really bad.

302
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:03,312
Speaker 1: Basically, the lungs are not meant to have anything to win them but air.

303
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:05,420
Speaker 1: Yeah breathing in literally anything.

304
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:10,349
Speaker 1: That's not just like, you know There are great for you.

305
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,780
Speaker 0: there are nebulizers there are Inhaled medicines that are safe and effective because they're testing thoroughly.

306
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:21,240
Speaker 1: I'm saying the number of things like random shit going into your lungs is just generally bad.

307
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, but here's the deal.

308
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:24,315
Speaker 1: campfires not good.

309
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:28,537
Speaker 0: So Inhaling a lipid can fuck you up.

310
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,835
Speaker 0: Inhaling a lot of things can fuck you up.

311
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:38,038
Speaker 0: when I was a kid I had asthma treatment or I do inhale drugs with these very expensive medical devices that would nebulize the medicine.

312
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:38,720
Speaker 0: So I inhaled it.

313
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:54,071
Speaker 0: The average vape that some kid is using and probably buying bootleg carts for Not as expensive as that very expensive nebulizer and probably not as safely designed and not as Keverely regulated.

314
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:54,535
Speaker 0: Mmm.

315
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,500
Speaker 0: So the deal is we don't know what is calling causing these serious and deadly illnesses and people who vape or vaping.

316
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:04,409
Speaker 1: But I can guess Yeah hard.

317
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:06,734
Speaker 1: Could it be the shit?

318
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:07,420
Speaker 1: They're just breathing.

319
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:10,187
Speaker 0: So here's the.

320
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,450
Speaker 0: there's the likely factors.

321
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:20,720
Speaker 0: one lot of bootleg THC carts from China Yeah, make to a lot of people who are vaping or hobbyists who are modifying their vape kits.

322
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:23,169
Speaker 0: That is not tested by anyone.

323
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,591
Speaker 0: Good luck.

324
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:24,173
Speaker 0: Have fun.

325
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:25,840
Speaker 0: Don't fuck with your vape shit.

326
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,769
Speaker 1: I mean people fuck with their bongs for decades.

327
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:29,552
Speaker 1: No problem.

328
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:43,323
Speaker 0: That's a little bit different because bongs tend to vaporize material from actual plant matter, which is highly unlikely to have propylene glycol and vitamin E and shit in it, I guess To the salt.

329
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:46,933
Speaker 0: the solvents themselves are often bootleg and dodgy.

330
00:23:47,033 --> 00:24:03,222
Speaker 0: the processes involves can be bootleg and dodgy and Even a lot of these flavor chemicals not really tested by the FDA to be deemed safe for inhaling or if they are Ostensibly safe for inhaling the models used to test that probably don't cover Vape.

331
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:10,360
Speaker 0: Lord who inhales like metric liters of this on an hourly basis because they're taking something else that people don't realize, right?

332
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:18,320
Speaker 1: Let's say that the FDA discovers that chemical X right now is safe As long as you have less than I don't know a milliliter a day.

333
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

334
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,514
Speaker 1: It's as long as you have less than a milliliter a day.

335
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:22,680
Speaker 1: You won't face no harm.

336
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,340
Speaker 1: So if you got what they do is they say, okay, that means you can put chemical X in food.

337
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,080
Speaker 1: However, the amount you can put in food is not a milliliter.

338
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:35,738
Speaker 1: The amount is like a milliliter divided by like a thousand or something.

339
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:44,900
Speaker 1: It's your Combinations of your body weight your I'm saying the limit that the regulators will say hmm All right, it's like oh, it's safe to have a milliliter of this per day.

340
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,640
Speaker 1: So they don't say okay put a milliliter of this in your milkshake.

341
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,400
Speaker 1: they say no, no, no, you can put one one thousandth of this in your milk tank because Somebody could theoretically have a milkshake with the chemical eat a cake with the chemical.

342
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,810
Speaker 0: Well, like the level of lead that starts to cause problems.

343
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:05,973
Speaker 0: pretty low the the maximum lead That's allowed to be in anything not that much higher than the head.

344
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,660
Speaker 0: but still there is a difference.

345
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,929
Speaker 0: You still don't want any lead.

346
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:10,480
Speaker 0: no amount of lead is safe, right?

347
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:14,160
Speaker 0: It's negligible enough, right?

348
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:22,956
Speaker 1: But I mean, you know even you know Even things that are super safe and like you could have a gallon of this a day and be fine They still make the legal limit in a food a fraction of.

349
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:27,657
Speaker 0: don't go buy Concentrated cherry flavor phenols and just drink them because you could be.

350
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:30,491
Speaker 1: you know Having so many different foods in a day.

351
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:34,067
Speaker 1: that thing could be in all the foods You need to the subtle total.

352
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,295
Speaker 1: Here's an example be less so that for the vapes.

353
00:25:36,395 --> 00:25:40,739
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, okay The one vape is fine, but you vape 20 times today.

354
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:45,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not if they're not cutting the fractions small enough or like case in point.

355
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:54,540
Speaker 0: a lot of vape models assume people are puffing into their mouths like you would with a hookah and Like having the flavor and not like fully inhaling it into their lungs.

356
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:59,620
Speaker 0: But then you watch some kid vape Lord and he fully inhales into his lungs and blows out a giant dragon cloud.

357
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:02,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are very different use cases.

358
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,753
Speaker 0: That's like the difference between drinking liquor from a shot glass and a pint glass or the bottle.

359
00:26:06,953 --> 00:26:08,638
Speaker 0: Yeah the bottle or the tap.

360
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:14,420
Speaker 1: so This like those summer break things with the hose.

361
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:26,140
Speaker 0: This shit is not as regulated as you think it is and I highly suggest you do not vape anything from a solution Until the real regulatory frameworks are in place, which is gonna take two to three years.

362
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:35,340
Speaker 0: that is my advice to you and if you're a connoisseur of nicotine or THC I recommend you consume them in more traditional routes for the time being.

363
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:44,174
Speaker 0: but anyway things Of the day what do you got?

364
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:44,880
Speaker 1: Check it out?

365
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,703
Speaker 1: Someone tweeted these.

366
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:47,430
Speaker 0: photos of these are so good.

367
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:51,427
Speaker 1: some prototype computers from back in the day Looks like maybe 80s time.

368
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:52,553
Speaker 0: Oh, look at those days.

369
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:53,196
Speaker 1: These look like 80s to me.

370
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:56,045
Speaker 1: I don't know if these computers actually worked.

371
00:26:56,105 --> 00:27:05,879
Speaker 1: this looks like early late 70s early 80s, right color, but these are designs at least of Hypothetical computers from the Soviet Union.

372
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,907
Speaker 1: I definitely feel like it's 80s.

373
00:27:07,968 --> 00:27:16,379
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's yeah, I don't know if any of these computers actually functioned or had computers in them, but it's just the designs themselves are.

374
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:23,790
Speaker 1: They look like something that would be like in a movie like as a prop You know like a movie about the like Tron or something, right?

375
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:35,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no these were actual design Manufactured prototype like computers from the Soviet Union and I don't see why like why wouldn't you just make a brand new computer that looks Just like this.

376
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:38,032
Speaker 0: We totally can't love a laptop that looked like.

377
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:41,144
Speaker 1: they totally have the technology to make any of these now No problem.

378
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:44,136
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I do want a QWERTY keyboard, but otherwise you don't want it.

379
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,000
Speaker 1: the Cyrillic keyboard.

380
00:27:45,482 --> 00:27:47,350
Speaker 1: No, I don't want Cyrillic grid keyboard.

381
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, this grid is my phone the telephone part either.

382
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,210
Speaker 0: I don't think I need the telephone part, right?

383
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,440
Speaker 1: But the point is we could make these now someone should.

384
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:56,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would love to just even.

385
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:57,334
Speaker 0: it was just.

386
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,239
Speaker 0: you know what I'd love to you.

387
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,860
Speaker 0: know What is your mission if you're the kind of person who goes to like the penny arcade expo and you hang out in the bring?

388
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,046
Speaker 0: Your own PC area.

389
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:07,779
Speaker 0: I want to see a BYO PC that looks like this shit.

390
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:08,625
Speaker 1: Good luck.

391
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:15,220
Speaker 0: If you do if you make this tell me So real brief thing of the day to do a non technology thing.

392
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:21,160
Speaker 0: There's a character that has appeared in more Disney things than you realize and is the most recent DuckTales.

393
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:31,360
Speaker 0: Most people know this character either from the most recent DuckTales or from the three Caballeros But this is the character Jose who is that green parrot guy from Brazil?

394
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:40,339
Speaker 0: This is the evolution of that character from early concept designs basically in chronological order of every appearance in Disney media.

395
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:42,563
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm a lot.

396
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:48,400
Speaker 0: this this these kinds of videos are my jams and this character is not that commonly known.

397
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:59,719
Speaker 0: And I like this character a lot Probably mostly for nostalgia reasons, but it's a pretty well put together video Especially considering how relatively obscure these sources are in some cases.

398
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,130
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm in the meta moment unites is back.

399

Speaker 1: It's gonna be I stopped reading it and it's long.

402
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,347
Speaker 1: I'll start reading it again.

403
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:15,440
Speaker 0: I'm gonna stop not gonna read anymore until you tell me you're reading it again.

404
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:17,659
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm busy unpacking every time I go home.

405
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're gonna read the tale of Genji and we're gonna talk about it.

406
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,833
Speaker 0: It's a spicy tales of core drama and romance.

407
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:27,986
Speaker 1: the first novel ever Period ever.

408
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:30,420
Speaker 1: the first one the first one not the first story.

409
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,958
Speaker 1: There's like, you know Gilgamesh is older, right?

410
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,730
Speaker 1: but it's the first novel.

411
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,195
Speaker 0: if you saw us from packs our Panel the new one with well actually a pretty new list of games.

412
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:40,580
Speaker 0: the 40 games you must play is on YouTube.

413
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:43,634

Speaker 0: I'm gonna continue to do.

415
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,879
Speaker 0: I know there is an appetite out there for this.

416
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:51,373
Speaker 0: So if you subscribe to the geek nights patreon, even you don't pay any money.

417
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:53,140
Speaker 0: the feed there will have this.

418
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,685
Speaker 0: There's a main bits feed now

419
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:55,448
Speaker 1: and

420
00:29:55,548 --> 00:30:16,931
Speaker 0: I am taking old episodes of geek nights where our main bit was interesting or notable as a topic and I'm extracting it from the episode because you might want to hear our review of say neon Genesis Evangelion from like 2007 but you don't want to hear us talking about 2007 era, what did you do today in beacon?

421
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:19,900
Speaker 0: And what is the anime news from Otakon?

422
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,867
Speaker 0: Like you just want the review.

423
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,800
Speaker 0: So I'm taking all these main bits.

424
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,415
Speaker 0: I'm focusing on board games and anime.

425
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,280
Speaker 0: anime is the new one.

426
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:33,991
Speaker 0: I'm making a YouTube feed and I'm making a patreon feed for all these main bits And I see people watching them.

427
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:47,274
Speaker 0: So I've already put up Our knee our Evangelion review our Evangelion final thoughts our big o final thoughts and our review of that movie that neither of us remembers at all The boy who saw the wind, okay.

428
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:52,560
Speaker 1: So once I've got my new apartment set up, I have the files now with the really good upload.

429
00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:00,839
Speaker 1: So I'll be able to use stream and upload to YouTube much more easily and I'll have new furniture and more space to make it Much more conducive to film things in general.

430
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,428
Speaker 1: So that's yep, that's a few lines a few months out.

431
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:09,022
Speaker 0: things like gig nights presents utenna things like a new thing We're working on.

432
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 0: that isn't really shit talk is we're fucking doing it because it's it's too close to our wheelhouse And it's while.

433
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,312
Speaker 0: it is gonna be a lot of work It's a lot less work to do this kind of thing.

434
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:23,724
Speaker 0: being the kinds of people that we are We really need to have secrets.

435
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,691
Speaker 1: It's like a stealer.

436
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,920
Speaker 0: No, no, no one is capable of doing this but us.

437
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:34,040
Speaker 0: But a stay tuned because I want to do like an episode of it first and like work out the pipeline anyway.

438
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the next convention is Pax unplugged.

439
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:41,449
Speaker 0: Oh, baby is coming up.

440
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:42,794
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

441
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:43,697
Speaker 1: It's like a month away.

442
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:46,287
Speaker 0: No two month away yep, so Pax unplugged is coming.

443
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:55,140
Speaker 0: we're gonna do in now probably a panel or two and Very likely at least one learn and play session because as you guys know play and win.

444
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,539
Speaker 1: Yeah learn and win.

445
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:01,616
Speaker 0: But if we get our way we're doing a learn and win play learn and play session.

446
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:07,018
Speaker 0: that is not one Not two, but three games in the same session.

447
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,179
Speaker 0: Oh, baby I'm actually pretty excited about this.

448
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:18,780
Speaker 0: Okay Cuz we used to have a lot of fun doing panels that were three mini panels in a row To do the ideas where we had 20 minutes of content, but we didn't have an hour's worth of content.

449
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:23,251
Speaker 0: Uh, not too long after that we got packs.

450
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:24,254
Speaker 0: are we got magfest?

451
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:25,136
Speaker 0: we got packs.

452
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:36,679
Speaker 0: me mag year Mag year super mag year pack south which is coming up like panel submissions are closing soon And then pat East was just announced and it is.

453
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:39,148
Speaker 1: I knew the dates I saw.

454
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,014
Speaker 1: they announced the dates officially just now.

455
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:42,800
Speaker 1: recently like a day or two ago.

456
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,367
Speaker 0: We've known those dates for a long time.

457
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:45,391
Speaker 1: I went to my calendar.

458
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:49,080
Speaker 1: There was already there and I'm like, okay Yes was correct.

459
00:32:49,260 --> 00:33:01,472
Speaker 0: All I'm gonna say is that based on the information that was leaked publicly not by packs, but by other organizations a long time ago It is pretty common knowledge the dates of most packs East for the foreseeable future.

460
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:04,600
Speaker 0: if you just poke around a little bit.

461
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:06,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is not hard to find this information.

462
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:16,360
Speaker 0: No So, uh, if you have found that information in the past But were dubious of its Providence use this sort of things as proof that it is accurate, right?

463
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,628
Speaker 1: It's sort of like Apple rumors.

464
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:18,916
Speaker 1: It's like they keep being right.

465
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:27,600
Speaker 0: So Yeah All right, so we have some other ideas for shows but I figure we go back to our old old ideas.

466
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:39,659
Speaker 0: We used to a lot of shows talking about Basic technology that we knew enough about to explain how it worked in the history of it in some fashion And I've realized Scott and I both it was Scott's idea, but I was thinking about this a lot.

467
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:46,780
Speaker 0: GPS Like just in like our own lives went from something I do not have access to right.

468
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,900
Speaker 1: It went from like this cool thing that like the government has that's super rare like or like satellite phones.

469
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:59,860
Speaker 1: Like if you're super rich or have super fancy equipment You can use this GPS thing that will tell you your latitude and longitude wherever you are on earth.

470
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it got you rare and now everyone has it in their fucking watch.

471
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then it went through this progression.

472
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:08,480
Speaker 0: So I want to kind of walk through the high-level history.

473
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,436
Speaker 0: We're not gonna go into too much specific history.

474
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:18,100
Speaker 0: Okay, you all I mean I do but like you can read Wikipedia to get exact years and like all the fiddly details.

475
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:18,812
Speaker 0: But here's the deal.

476
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,867
Speaker 0: GPS is a concept is very new.

477
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,335
Speaker 0: like this was not a thing until the 70s.

478
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,120
Speaker 0: Yeah the 1970s.

479
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:30,085
Speaker 0: what before then?

480
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,094
Speaker 0: there really wasn't a good way to know where you were.

481
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:35,199
Speaker 1: had to use old-school naval shit.

482
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:40,369
Speaker 1: You know Reckoning sexton's stars who the fuck knows.

483
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:48,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, like navigation like ocean navigation Naval navigation air navigation even ground navigation These were difficult.

484
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:53,511
Speaker 0: if you wanted to drive from point A to point B You better know how to read a lot of that.

485
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:55,840
Speaker 1: You had a map and road signs, right?

486
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,608
Speaker 1: You know the road signs you'd look at the map.

487
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,392
Speaker 1: You have a compass.

488
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,160
Speaker 1: you'd orient yourself with a compass.

489
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:06,405
Speaker 1: All right, I grew up, you know as a kid the cars fit a lot of cars and I was in the 80s and 90s Compasses in them.

490
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:08,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that when you were in you use it.

491
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:12,372
Speaker 1: looking at your paper map book You would know which way the car was facing.

492
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:17,010
Speaker 0: when you reference the street signs I mean, I literally like learned orienteering.

493
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,913
Speaker 0: cuz when I went hiking.

494
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:18,896
Speaker 0: there's no GPS.

495
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,320
Speaker 0: if I get lost fucking die.

496
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:29,380
Speaker 0: So even as late as high school I would like carry a compass and like terrain charts and maps and plot courses and do real orienteering.

497
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,911
Speaker 0: Now Emily and I just did a long hike through the wilderness this weekend.

498
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:35,520
Speaker 0: GPS just there Strava tracked the whole thing.

499
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:36,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, Google Maps.

500
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,097
Speaker 0: I could zoom in on the trail.

501
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:38,741
Speaker 1: the maps There's.

502
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,614
Speaker 1: people got to understand the maps are separate from the GPS.

503
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:42,860
Speaker 1: right totally separate, right?

504
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,539
Speaker 1: So the GPS all it does is it tells you here's your latitude and longitude bro the end.

505
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't get you any other information.

506
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:57,600
Speaker 1: But if you have a map and the map has latitude and longitude on it You can just draw a dot on the map of where you fucking are.

507
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,066
Speaker 1: And then if you have a compass you can draw an arrow sticking out of your dot Showing where you're facing.

508
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,034
Speaker 1: and now you've got a really useful map.

509
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:05,379
Speaker 0: so here's you know what this means for you.

510
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:12,453
Speaker 0: Let's say you have a smartphone But you do not have global roaming and you're in a country that you don't live in.

511
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:30,906
Speaker 0: if you pre-cache the Google Map and You just leave your phone in a mode where it can't connect to the internet Your GPS will still just work with Google Maps because GPS And this is like the most common misconception about it is 100% one way.

512
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:35,256
Speaker 0: the GPS system literally cannot know anything about your phone.

513
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:45,180
Speaker 0: all it is doing is Broadcasting information and your phone uses that information to be able to calculate your latitude longitude and altitude.

514
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,432
Speaker 1: It's as free as and private as radio.

515
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:51,963
Speaker 1: There's basically just these satellites in space Broadcasting.

516
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:55,238
Speaker 1: now that a for by primarily the US Air Force.

517
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:01,314
Speaker 0: well GPS came out of the same kinds of things that gave us the internet GPS system.

518
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:04,322
Speaker 0: one is owned by the United States Government.

519
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:05,911
Speaker 0: it is not a public ring.

520
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,600
Speaker 1: It covers the entire world.

521
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:15,673
Speaker 1: It's owned and controlled mostly by the United States government almost entirely Entirely almost entirely because the US government.

522
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:17,640
Speaker 1: actually are even the other countries using it.

523
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,540
Speaker 1: They're just using it from us for free because it's useless if it doesn't cover the whole world.

524
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:28,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like even if you're in an enemy country like North Korea, you can just use GPS and the US can't stop you Yep.

525
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:36,200
Speaker 0: Well, so the UPS can't stop you because GPS until the year 2000 was not really that usable for civilians.

526
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,853
Speaker 0: No, in fact when it was invented, it was not usable at all by civilians.

527
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:51,380
Speaker 0: It got to a point later where degraded Forms of the Jeep basically the GPS network, it's hard to explain how this works like getting new tech.

528
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,965
Speaker 1: Oh, I can explain how it works very easily.

529
00:37:53,045 --> 00:38:06,264
Speaker 0: No, no, but in terms of the selective availability idea GPS satellites are out there broadcasting but the technology to use that information was really only available to the US military and Civilian receivers.

530
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,612
Speaker 0: you got degraded quality.

531
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:11,200
Speaker 0: They had much less accurate information.

532
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:21,437
Speaker 0: It was not until the year 2000 that that went away and The military grade like accuracy is the same accuracy that you with your shitty smartphone can get.

533
00:38:21,457 --> 00:38:22,500
Speaker 1: All right, so here's how it works.

534
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:22,942
Speaker 1: It's real.

535
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:23,664
Speaker 1: It's really simple.

536
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:31,150
Speaker 1: when we ended a program called selective availability, right in space The the US has launched like it's almost 30 something.

537
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,053
Speaker 1: I mean, I think there's 24.

538
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:32,515
Speaker 0: There's 33 now.

539
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:35,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like a.

540
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:42,214
Speaker 1: there's like a promise that they will always have a certain number available Which is like the number needed but only 24 are needed.

541
00:38:42,274 --> 00:38:42,897
Speaker 0: I think there's 31 in orbit.

542
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,532
Speaker 1: There's more than that many just in case something happens.

543
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,340
Speaker 1: They can turn on a backup or something, right?

544
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got more than they need, right?

545
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:55,400
Speaker 0: They think they need 24 But anyway at 24, I think is the bare minimum to provide global service.

546
00:38:55,501 --> 00:39:02,830
Speaker 1: No matter where you are on planet earth You will have line of sight to four of these fucking satellites.

547
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,893
Speaker 1: Yeah anymore is better.

548
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:09,294
Speaker 1: bottom of the Arctic South Pole North Pole China middle of the Pacific Ocean doesn't matter.

549
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:15,714
Speaker 1: you will be able to Basically fire a laser beam if you wanted to and hit at least four of these things.

550
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:17,500
Speaker 1: Yep, they're geostationary.

551
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,780
Speaker 1: They just stay put so that if there was one directly above New York, right?

552
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:23,711
Speaker 1: It would always be directly above New York.

553
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:25,200
Speaker 1: It just goes around with the earth.

554
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,662
Speaker 0: No, I want I want I want to say that six is like the magic number for having faster sync and accuracy Whatever.

555
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,867
Speaker 0: but more is the minimum.

556
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,760
Speaker 0: with less than four GPS doesn't really work that well.

557
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:42,408
Speaker 1: So you turn on a little radio right basically and you listen for these things because they're just shooting down at the earth They're signal right and they're broadcasting information.

558
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,860
Speaker 0: That's basically just coordinates and timestamps and identifiers.

559
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:51,375
Speaker 1: Just saying I am satellite number X right and it is currently this time.

560
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:53,220
Speaker 1: and a little bit more metadata, right?

561
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,742
Speaker 1: It's a metadata.

562
00:39:53,762 --> 00:39:54,385
Speaker 1: It's not much.

563
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:56,455
Speaker 1: It's really very small amount of data.

564
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:57,480
Speaker 1: crazy simple, right?

565
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,135
Speaker 1: You turn on your little radio and your radio hears satellite.

566
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:02,200
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm hearing news.

567
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,323
Speaker 1: I'm hearing broadcasts from satellites one two and three and the times that they're sending me are this time this time in this time Right.

568
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:13,160
Speaker 1: Let me do some math and it does some math and the math is really complicated.

569
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,164
Speaker 0: I don't understand it.

570
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:19,063
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna try to explain it how what the math does I can Number.

571
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:20,689
Speaker 1: so what the math does is okay.

572
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:23,019
Speaker 1: satellite one is this far away from me.

573
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:28,020
Speaker 1: Satellite two is this far away from me and satellite three is this far away from me, right?

574
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:32,428
Speaker 1: Well, I know that satellite one is Hearable in this sphere.

575
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:35,580
Speaker 0: if you're anywhere and more to solve the equation you actually do need four.

576
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:37,228
Speaker 1: I thought you only need three.

577
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:40,162
Speaker 0: so so here's oh, so here's the P Here's the magic.

578
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:45,500
Speaker 0: and I know this a lot because in the early days of smartphones doing this smartphones are really shitty at it.

579
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:50,019
Speaker 0: So I had an app that would show me which that like all the raw satellite data and it was really cool.

580
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:58,740
Speaker 0: but basically if you have three GPS satellites It'll Basically only be able to project your latitude and longitude.

581
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,839
Speaker 0: But to solve the equations you have to assume that you're at sea level.

582
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:10,392
Speaker 0: meaning if you have three satellites and you are at sea level your Position will be pretty accurate like it'll be out.

583
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:11,718
Speaker 1: But if you're up in the air you need the fourth.

584
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:12,180
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

585
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:15,491
Speaker 0: So if you're up if you're high or low, you're.

586
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,920
Speaker 0: your latitude and longitude will be wrong.

587
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,192
Speaker 1: But more importantly I such a small amount.

588
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:28,240
Speaker 0: no by a pretty big amount Or two your altitude cannot be calculated right regardless kind of important for a lot of reasons.

589
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:32,060
Speaker 0: So you need four satellites to actually solve the actual number.

590
00:41:32,682 --> 00:41:33,425
Speaker 1: Altitude is different.

591
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:37,620
Speaker 1: your distance from the satellites will be different exactly which is what you're using to figure everything out.

592
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,480
Speaker 0: That's why your Strava if you like record a run it actually shows like your altitude over the course of the run.

593
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:51,159
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what happens is mathematically it says, okay Well, here's the sphere of coverage for satellite one is the sphere of coverage of satellite two, right?

594
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,870
Speaker 1: Here's the sphere of coverage for satellite three.

595
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:57,242
Speaker 1: They're this far away from you Right.

596
00:41:57,423 --> 00:42:01,478
Speaker 1: So these three spheres if you were this far away from the three of them, right?

597
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,789
Speaker 1: You would be in and it sort of combines them all.

598
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,428
Speaker 1: and the intersection of all of that is where you are Right, and that's all there is to it.

599
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:11,940
Speaker 0: Yep, but the actual numbers math.

600
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:17,508
Speaker 0: the reason we're not talking about it is it's pretty complex and It like to give you a sample of this.

601
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:23,826
Speaker 1: it may there's a lot of calculus involved plus yes relativity is yes Literally fun part.

602
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:26,640
Speaker 0: This is like literal relativity matters here.

603
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:38,256
Speaker 0: The fact that radio signals travel at the same speed regardless of two in terms of you your phone Regardless of how fast that satellite is moving literally matters in these equations, right?

604
00:42:38,276 --> 00:42:39,640
Speaker 1: The satellite is in space.

605
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,320
Speaker 1: It has less gravity.

606
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:44,580
Speaker 1: Therefore the time is off by a tiny bit, right?

607
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,733
Speaker 1: I think like the time of the things in space is going a little.

608
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:49,280
Speaker 1: it looks is slow or fast.

609
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,118
Speaker 1: I don't remember right but the point is the times need to be ultra ultra precise.

610
00:42:54,178 --> 00:42:56,646
Speaker 0: the new nanosecond precision right.

611
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:03,430
Speaker 1: the newer GPS satellites have better atomic clocks in them and Therefore give better timing.

612
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:05,120
Speaker 0: Oh, there's more to it than that.

613
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:09,334
Speaker 1: But the point is you need super if you don't have accurate time on your device.

614
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:11,000
Speaker 1: You're not getting shit, right?

615
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:13,268
Speaker 0: To it to a degree that did that.

616
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:16,700
Speaker 0: the cool thing about GPS is that for the calculations?

617
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,859
Speaker 0: It relies on all the timestamps from all the satellite data.

618
00:43:20,462 --> 00:43:31,580
Speaker 0: Even if your phone's like local time is not super hyper I don't want to say accurate but it's not super precise because your phone's processor is not a real-time device, right?

619
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:42,719
Speaker 1: But anyway, you need it has to account for the fact that the times coming from all those satellites are moving faster Slower I forget because of literally.

620
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:45,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, he goes empty.

621
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,020
Speaker 0: So here's here's why the history of this is important area of relativity.

622
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:54,616
Speaker 0: the Internet and GPS are both things that were developed solely for military use.

623
00:43:55,017 --> 00:44:01,294
Speaker 0: that were so Useful that the United States government graciously decided to let the world use them.

624
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:02,376
Speaker 1: the whole world.

625
00:44:02,617 --> 00:44:05,620
Speaker 0: and today like GPS is a US thing.

626
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:19,079
Speaker 0: So if you've ever heard of GLONASS GLONASS is a completely separate parallel system that the Russians launched because the US Strategy today the US relies like our military relies heavily on GPS.

627
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:24,636
Speaker 0: We have fail-safe systems to deal with like if GPS is disrupted, but they learn.

628
00:44:24,677 --> 00:44:25,760
Speaker 1: they learn how to use a sextant.

629
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:27,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's other things.

630
00:44:27,655 --> 00:44:37,734
Speaker 0: I don't want to get it I don't want to go off on a tangent, but the way nuclear warheads Navigate is fucking insane and they do not rely at all on GPS.

631
00:44:37,754 --> 00:44:39,320
Speaker 1: Well, they got to go real fucking far.

632
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:48,744
Speaker 0: One of the ways they navigate is they have cameras pointed up that navigate based on the fixed positions of stars images of them.

633
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:49,748
Speaker 1: what if they go his star?

634
00:44:49,788 --> 00:45:02,554
Speaker 0: we had to update that if the stars go out if a star blows up If a bunch of stars blow up and that happened at the right time in history to where a nuclear warhead is in the air At that exact moment that the light changes here.

635
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,607
Speaker 0: Yeah Trouble, but there are.

636
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:07,554
Speaker 0: they also use geo.

637
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,060
Speaker 0: Oh, I forget the term for this.

638
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:26,420
Speaker 0: there's like these mass maps of the earth like where there are gravity hotspots and They also use that data Because they have to be able to navigate based on first principles derived solely from the data They can collect independently on their own while traveling at high speed.

639
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:31,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm digressing here, but so the Russians developed GLONASS.

640
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:38,440
Speaker 0: Europe still doesn't really have like its own GPS if the US and Europe went to war like Europe's just kind of effed.

641
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:40,580
Speaker 0: I think they're building something called Galileo.

642
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:45,280
Speaker 1: What's our what's our strategy like encrypt the GPS in such a way that only the US military can use it?

643
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,757
Speaker 0: Uh, so we'll just fucking.

644
00:45:46,818 --> 00:46:00,180
Speaker 0: yeah we can basically turn off the signals that all civilian devices and all foreign devices use and Instead only the encrypted signals that only the US military can interpret can be used.

645
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:07,260
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, that's I'm Really really really generalizing because some of this is secret and also I don't understand it that well.

646
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:11,717
Speaker 1: I mean you can go to GPS gov and read all the public information about it.

647
00:46:11,757 --> 00:46:12,540
Speaker 1: There's a ton of it.

648
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:19,045
Speaker 1: There's even like show you the lot the locations of the satellites which models they are What teachers they have.

649
00:46:19,065 --> 00:46:28,100
Speaker 0: the old model was more like what you described were basically the US had this idea of selective Selective availability which meant we could degrade the quality globally.

650
00:46:28,281 --> 00:46:40,480
Speaker 0: So if there was a war the US basically flips a switch and the entire GPS network goes to a degraded mode Where the US military still gets the hyper accuracy and everyone else's accuracy goes to shit, right?

651
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:40,721
Speaker 1: All right.

652
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:43,749
Speaker 1: So let's talk about some like, you know GPS everyday life stuff, right?

653
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:50,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is hard to express to you how radically Civilian access to GPS changes the world, right?

654
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:53,040
Speaker 0: So like as much as the internet, right?

655
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,360
Speaker 1: There's like the privacy and location data situation, right?

656
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:07,119
Speaker 1: It's like okay you have the power to know exactly where you are on earth to help you with mostly navigating Yeah, also maybe remembering where you were or finding other things because now those things know where they are.

657
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:13,380
Speaker 1: But the fact that you can do this one finding your friends finding things you lost if they are right things like that.

658
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:24,200
Speaker 1: But now if that if you write down where you were at given times Right now this information about where you were you can be tracked everywhere on earth as well.

659
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,651
Speaker 1: Yep, even though the GPS system itself is completely private.

660
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:32,020
Speaker 1: It's just a broadcast to find out where you are, right?

661
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,287
Speaker 1: Creates no new information that can track you.

662
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:37,977
Speaker 1: your phone happens to just write down.

663
00:47:37,997 --> 00:47:41,240
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You were this glad it didn't launch you to this time.

664
00:47:42,962 --> 00:47:43,724
Speaker 0: A bunch of stuff.

665
00:47:43,744 --> 00:48:00,465
Speaker 0: so it's sharing it with a bunch of apps and even if you don't share anything even if you 100% lock down your phone providing any data about where you are It's still connecting to cell towers and your cell phone can itself be uniquely identified Which can still find your position.

666
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:10,120
Speaker 1: also lots of devices like cell phones and computers use other additional supplementary systems to sort of help the GPS thing.

667
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,648
Speaker 0: well, here's the.

668
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:26,380
Speaker 0: the problem specifically is that the radios and the calculations and all the ways to figure out which satellites to look for because they're all on different frequencies and programmable antennas work is kind of complicated.

669
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:36,588
Speaker 0: It's very hard for a small antenna device with limited capabilities to scan and find All the different signals and figure out which one to use.

670
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:43,920
Speaker 0: that's why on old cell phones when you turn it on in a new Place it takes it a long time to actually figure out where you are.

671
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:52,140
Speaker 0: You can bootstrap that process by using other easier things like Scott described like oh what Wi-Fi things are nearby cell towers.

672
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,413
Speaker 0: Am I connected to your computer right?

673
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:55,760
Speaker 1: You just go on your desktop computer.

674
00:48:55,961 --> 00:49:00,200
Speaker 1: It doesn't have any GPS or radio receivers and Google Maps still shows you kind of where you are.

675
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,346
Speaker 1: It kind of shows you what you know how it does.

676
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:03,036
Speaker 1: it looks your IP address and it knows.

677
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:05,831
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Okay, I kind of know where that IP address is.

678
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,420
Speaker 0: You're really close.

679
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,547
Speaker 0: That's why if you turn off Wi-Fi

680
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:25,020
Speaker 1: your cell phone knows what cell tower you're connected to and it knows what Wi-Fi access points Are nearby and it you know someone at some point use GPS while and they said, okay Well when that person used GPS they were at this latitude and longitude and these Wi-Fi access points were in range.

681
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:28,152
Speaker 0: Not even once you connect it to just once you get just one.

682
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:30,260
Speaker 1: just these SS IDs were in range.

683
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:31,340
Speaker 1: Well, let's look at Scott.

684
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:34,633
Speaker 1: Oh that exact same list of SS IDs were in range.

685
00:49:34,854 --> 00:49:38,889
Speaker 1: when Scott's asking where he is Even though he's not looking at any satellites whatsoever.

686
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:41,560
Speaker 1: He's probably really close to where that other person was.

687
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:47,080
Speaker 1: What are the odds of there being two places on earth with the exact same list of Wi-Fi access points in range?

688
00:49:47,303 --> 00:50:00,399
Speaker 0: That is why Every now and then if you reboot your cell phone and you look at Google Maps like right away It might for a like a few like 30 seconds or so show you in like Chicago or New York or some generic place.

689
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:11,040
Speaker 0: You can actually if you wanted to Because there's like a bunch of hotel Wi-Fi that happened to match up with where you are currently in some different place And then it corrects itself as soon as the GPS data comes in, right?

690
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,630
Speaker 1: You got to think there's like maybe a Holiday Inn.

691
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,039
Speaker 1: and it's got Holiday Inn Wi-Fi, right?

692
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,160
Speaker 1: And there's no other Wi-Fi's in range because it's the middle of nowhere, right?

693
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:21,740
Speaker 1: And so it's like, okay, how many places on earth have that exact same as well?

694
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,447
Speaker 1: There's another holiday in the middle of nowhere.

695
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:28,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're trying to figure out GPS based on that alone Well, there's a lot of choices.

696
00:50:28,189 --> 00:50:29,073
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

697
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:33,431
Speaker 0: That's also why you'll see your GPS Have that big range that gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

698
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:39,100
Speaker 1: Yep, because it's using all this data plus What's your IP address and what cell tower you connect to do?

699
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,857
Speaker 1: Ah, I know it's holiday and that is yeah.

700
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,946
Speaker 1: Oh and it's like super accurate.

701
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:49,515
Speaker 1: and then you look at the satellites and suddenly your latitude and longitude of like a hundred decimals Points or whatever the precision is.

702
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:50,300
Speaker 1: I don't know anymore.

703
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:52,403
Speaker 1: There's a lot of precision going on But

704
00:50:52,423 --> 00:51:04,653
Speaker 0: the precision is a big thing because the year 2000 is when GPS became useful to civilians because that is when you got the real accuracy of the old system Which is about a 16-foot window meaning it

705
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:08,999
Speaker 1: knows if you get a few meters It's pretty much what you need for to do any real thing.

706
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it's bigger than that, then it could be like you could take a turn too early.

707
00:51:14,522 --> 00:51:21,484
Speaker 1: Right, you can think that a business is actually two businesses down you start but as long as like, you know a few meters It's like okay.

708
00:51:21,524 --> 00:51:23,351
Speaker 1: That's like the size of a car or two.

709
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,138
Speaker 1: You can navigate with this now.

710
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,854
Speaker 0: now There's some crazy new developments because there's a bunch of like.

711
00:51:28,196 --> 00:51:28,780
Speaker 0: it gets complicated.

712
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,049
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of bands and like.

713
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:37,017
Speaker 0: there's different types of GPS service But basically the new l5 band that's currently being deployed like just like.

714
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:38,081
Speaker 0: I think it'll be fit Like it.

715
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:45,094
Speaker 0: one of the last satellites was launched for this recently and there's upgrades to the system That will bring the accuracy down to under 12 inches.

716
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:50,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, but as per all new receivers no existing device.

717
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,261
Speaker 0: Like.

718
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:57,918
Speaker 0: I think some of the newest GPS devices as of 2018 will even start to use that new band.

719
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,583
Speaker 0: Yep 18 like 12 inches.

720
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:00,045
Speaker 0: that is amazing.

721
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:08,440
Speaker 0: Can you can do think about you could start making games based on GPS data with that level of precision?

722
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:17,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but so back and also, you know used to be when you want a GPS like at least for navigation You had to buy the standalone GPS device.

723
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:21,480
Speaker 1: Yep, and then like I remember like the earlier 2000s you'd buy like a Garmin thing.

724
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:27,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Garmin still around they make yeah But those devices would basically just tell you your latitude longitude altitude.

725
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:32,100
Speaker 1: All those devices were were just a GPS and maps and nothing else.

726
00:52:32,605 --> 00:52:46,400
Speaker 0: most of those devices used to be just Latitude longitude altitude and then you had to either buy a data set that oh, yeah Yes and charts or usually you do a mapping charting or navigation system subscribe to the map thing, right?

727
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now Everyone just got it in their phone.

728
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:51,709
Speaker 1: It's way easier.

729
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:56,180
Speaker 1: Yep, you don't got to pay shit Google just give it to you for free in exchange for all your data.

730
00:52:56,361 --> 00:53:06,160
Speaker 0: But that shows the kind of like how the internet was just this Network to connect very large computers to each other and keep them connected even if a city disappeared.

731
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:19,709
Speaker 0: GPS was a technology that was just designed basically, so that American bombers and warships could figure out where they are and target weapons and then Coupled that system being released to the public.

732
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:34,760
Speaker 0: coupled with these free data sets like Google Maps those two technologies existing together in a public space allowed this explosion of Capabilities that hardly anyone had ever even imagined radically changed the way we interact with the world.

733
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:41,142
Speaker 1: Well, look the military made both of these things the internet and the GPS and then made both of them just yeah for everybody Right.

734
00:53:41,222 --> 00:53:46,298
Speaker 1: Imagine if the entire military budget was spent on making things like that and not just some of it.

735
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,620
Speaker 0: or Imagine if our government was more functional and more of these kinds of things were turned into public services.

736
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:57,220
Speaker 1: Yes, the public service aircraft carrier way better than the airport.

737
00:53:58,121 --> 00:54:01,251
Speaker 1: It just comes to you and you get on in the plane takes home.

738
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:02,094
Speaker 1: How great is that?

739
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:03,579
Speaker 1: Man, we should just get rid of it.

740
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:05,203
Speaker 0: I could see something.

741
00:54:05,263 --> 00:54:11,240
Speaker 0: I feel like US military drone technology could be leveraged in the civilian sphere and kill a lot fewer people.

742
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:18,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, but like GPS Really is a big deal.

743
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:25,180
Speaker 1: I think what happened is that when it was really new I think is when it was first made away when people first became aware of it and had access to it.

744
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:30,203
Speaker 1: It was amazing and now people don't understand how it works At least always.

745
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:31,026
Speaker 1: I guess that you know.

746
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:36,389
Speaker 1: back in the day when it was new the people who did have it did Understand how it works.

747
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:37,860
Speaker 1: is it was only nerds who cared a lot?

748
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,160
Speaker 0: Yeah Like on my phone it would take my phone like five plus minutes to actually get a GPS sync.

749
00:54:43,482 --> 00:54:56,620
Speaker 1: Right, like when I got my smart, right, but now It's like yeah, there's still that those still those nerds still understand how it works But there's just so many more users who don't right now So many users who don't understand and don't appreciate.

750
00:54:57,022 --> 00:55:05,140
Speaker 1: So there's this impression that like people forgot how it works and it's like no It just has a bunch of users now that weren't users before right that don't know or don't care.

751
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,204
Speaker 1: They just take it for granted.

752
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:08,553
Speaker 1: and it's like you need to realize.

753
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:19,840
Speaker 1: this is like a military project that you were using when you're like How do I get to grandma's house that relies on general relativity and Einstein's crazy theories that have been proven to have practical?

754
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:28,329
Speaker 1: Applicability the internet which has now been you know corporatized and internationalized to some extent at least DNS GPS has not.

755
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:29,940
Speaker 0: the US military continues.

756
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:37,460
Speaker 1: All those satellites are launched by the Air Force from an Air Force base on an Air Force rocket.

757
00:55:37,943 --> 00:55:39,471
Speaker 1: Right that huge military budget.

758
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:41,280
Speaker 1: We're like, oh the military budget is so big.

759
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,740
Speaker 1: Well some small portion of that is putting all the satellite.

760
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,843
Speaker 0: Go to the Wikipedia page and look up the emblem for the US Air Force 50th Spacewing.

761
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:53,996
Speaker 0: their icon is it's just says master of space and it's like a Griffin.

762
00:55:54,016 --> 00:56:05,230
Speaker 1: Yeah See if I could see that's the thing is if I could sign up for the Air Force and be guaranteed To be in that section only and not have to kill anybody Right, then I might be okay with that.

763
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're in direct.

764
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:07,498
Speaker 0: I mean GPS.

765
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:14,240
Speaker 0: GPS Existed first and foremost to allow our weapons to be able to more effectively kill the right people.

766
00:56:14,702 --> 00:56:18,440
Speaker 1: I would say ah blow up when you are in this place, which is the enemy city.

767
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:20,269
Speaker 1: How will I know when I am in that place?

768
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:22,320
Speaker 1: Well, we have launched 30-something satellites.

769
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:25,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, that will help you figure out when you're in the right place.

770
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,700
Speaker 1: So when you get your latitude is X and your longitude is Y blow the fuck up.

771
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:38,676
Speaker 0: So the key takeaways here are one the whole Private military like hidden military secret project to public service.

772
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:41,466
Speaker 0: That is a pathway We need to exploit more to.

773
00:56:41,746 --> 00:56:43,211
Speaker 0: GPS is fucking amazing.

774
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,217
Speaker 0: And I don't think you understand how new it is.

775
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:48,126
Speaker 0: and Three it is one way.

776
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,793
Speaker 0: GPS itself is literally a one-way thing.

777
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:53,260
Speaker 0: The GPS system cannot track you, right?

778
00:56:53,380 --> 00:57:00,286
Speaker 1: You can get a GPS device that will tell you where you are And if it's not a cell phone It won't tell anyone else where you are either.

779
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:08,858
Speaker 0: for if there ever is a serious major war in the world GPS will probably be turned off for a period for at least for us.

780
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:23,040
Speaker 1: Well for everybody except the US military and lazy NATO or anyone who has stolen military GPS devices, yeah And has probably you're probably gonna need like codes to enter into them or something to like turn on the secret mode or some shit.

781
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know how they work.

782
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:25,236
Speaker 1: We don't know.

783
00:57:25,297 --> 00:57:25,740
Speaker 1: It's secret.

784
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:33,960
Speaker 0: I do also imagine that a lot of military things will use a lot of first principles navigation techniques that are super classified.

785
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:35,239
Speaker 1: I still make everyone learn them.

786
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:43,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you're like if an aircraft carrier is out in the ocean and GPS goes down They still gotta fucking be able to navigate.

787
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:46,057
Speaker 0: and you know if they're gonna do they're gonna bust out sextants and shit and radar.

788
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:50,575
Speaker 0: Yep Compasses like ship captains still know how to navigate.

789
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:51,359
Speaker 0: They got an aircraft carrier.

790
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,340
Speaker 1: They can have a plane take off and look around.

791
00:57:54,063 --> 00:58:03,955
Speaker 0: When I was doing my like kid like space camp stuff I learned how to navigate an airplane using all that old technology.

792
00:58:03,975 --> 00:58:07,048
Speaker 0: and like dead reckoning and airspeed stuff I know how to navigate an airplane.

793
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:10,887
Speaker 1: You have a compass and you look out the window And you say what's that down there?

794
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:12,333
Speaker 0: All right, what's that down there?

795
00:58:12,353 --> 00:58:13,840
Speaker 1: It looks like that looks like my map.

796
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:14,966
Speaker 0: What's that down there?

797
00:58:15,006 --> 00:58:16,575
Speaker 0: blue ocean in every direction?

798
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:17,339
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck me.

799
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:21,297
Speaker 0: Do you know how?

800
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:26,980
Speaker 0: In World War two before we had any of this shit, you know aircraft found their way back to aircraft carriers.

801
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,868
Speaker 1: They sent a smoke signal or something flags.

802
00:58:29,928 --> 00:58:30,330
Speaker 1: I don't know.

803
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:39,220
Speaker 0: Uh, it's it's actually really fascinating Big horn, so they flashed a light at him depending on what year it was.

804
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:40,885
Speaker 0: The answers ranged from it.

805
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:46,244
Speaker 0: better not have moved to to good luck To.

806
00:58:46,705 --> 00:58:48,130
Speaker 0: they're gonna turn their lights on.

807
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,374
Speaker 0: I hope you got close enough.

808
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:55,430
Speaker 0: I eventually guess the light method now - well everybody landed on a different aircraft carrier.

809
00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:04,040
Speaker 1: because fuck me or I don't go back to the aircraft carrier I go back to land somewhere land or I go I fight until I run out of fuel or die and then get out.

810
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:07,579
Speaker 0: Oh, I crash in China and try to make my way home on my own.

811
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:12,107
Speaker 0: When radar appeared it turned into.

812
00:59:12,468 --> 00:59:16,840
Speaker 0: they will point radar in the direction of the target and the plays will follow the radar back.

813
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:17,645
Speaker 0: But guess what?

814
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,780
Speaker 0: Anyone can follow that radar back.

815
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,096
Speaker 1: I followed it back to the enemy base.

816
00:59:22,217 --> 00:59:25,331
Speaker 1: Yeah Like well, I guess I'm here.

817
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:29,440
Speaker 1: I can drop the bomb on it, but Then I'm in trouble.

818
00:59:35,902 --> 00:59:38,420
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

819
