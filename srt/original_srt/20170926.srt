1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,246
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday September 26 2017.

2
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:17,099
Speaker 0: I'm rim I am and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,862
Speaker 0: on Tuesday it's Black Friday the 2010 board game about Black Friday the stock market Black Friday.

4
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:26,926
Speaker 1: let's do this.

5
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,718
Speaker 0: so a few days ago I smell.

6
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:39,741
Speaker 0: I came home and I smelled like a whiff of mildew which I have never smelled in my New York apartment before.

7
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:43,532
Speaker 1: I have just the old guy yeah.

8
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:46,241
Speaker 0: but then it disappeared like I couldn't find it.

9
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:47,366
Speaker 1: oh so just a whiff.

10
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:47,948
Speaker 0: it was a way.

11
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:49,475
Speaker 0: I mean we've sappin.

12
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,625
Speaker 1: I've smelled whiffs of all kinds of smells.

13
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,013
Speaker 1: you know I even you know.

14
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:56,630
Speaker 1: sometimes I'll even smell a whiff of gas and like oh shit yup yup yup.

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:02,719
Speaker 1: and then it's gone and like well I guess it was just like someone you know twisted something on their barbecue.

16
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:10,319
Speaker 0: there was one time I was biking home back when I worked downtown and I was like way downtown and I'm in the middle of the street and I stopped at a stoplight.

17
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,237
Speaker 1: I've definitely smelled it while biking in the middle but I smelled hella gas.

18
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:17,129
Speaker 1: I've never smelled hella gas I've only.

19
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:18,414
Speaker 0: so I'm like huh.

20
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,783
Speaker 0: so the first thing I did was bike away.

21
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:21,846
Speaker 1: yeah a good idea.

22
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:34,043
Speaker 0: and then I was about to call 911 and then I see a whole bunch of Con Edison trucks come up and a bunch of people get out and start looking around and sniffing and then one guy points in a manhole and they were on it.

23
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:39,101
Speaker 0: okay but so then the next day I came home and there was a whiff of it again.

24
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:40,868
Speaker 0: second whiff.

25
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,053
Speaker 1: that's a job I don't want.

26
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,946
Speaker 1: Con Edison report go to the emergency where some smell gas job.

27
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,611
Speaker 1: it's a bad job.

28
00:01:48,252 --> 00:02:00,100
Speaker 0: so uh but then I can't find it again and then I hear a bunch of construction noises going on and it sounds like it's in the wall behind our kitchen mm-hmm like in the inside area.

29
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:08,102
Speaker 0: and then I go into my bathroom and there was some old water damage there and I see that they're like they're working outside of our apartment but related.

30
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,354
Speaker 0: so I wonder if they're like fixing some water damage.

31
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:14,413
Speaker 0: so I found a plausible explanation for occasional mildew with so I ignored it.

32
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:20,090
Speaker 0: I came home the third day and I smelled it way stronger.

33
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,502
Speaker 0: so at that point I have to do the I don't.

34
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,751
Speaker 0: I don't just casually investigate.

35
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:36,031
Speaker 0: I methodically start going around the apartment following the walls sniff testing mm-hmm and then I get near the fridge and it's real strong mm-hmm.

36
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:36,694
Speaker 0: so it's.

37
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:39,508
Speaker 0: I think it's behind the fridge which is terrifying.

38
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:40,735
Speaker 1: cuz how do you get back there?

39
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:41,981
Speaker 0: even yeah but it's not.

40
00:02:42,022 --> 00:02:43,773
Speaker 1: you know it would really help you see behind the fridge.

41
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:47,375
Speaker 0: uh yeah I know exactly what helped me see behind the fridge endoscope.

42
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,043
Speaker 0: I think I might get one of those endoscopes.

43
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:52,275
Speaker 0: actually I got one in an Amazon cart right now.

44
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,176
Speaker 0: but but I want to do some research to make sure I'm getting the right one.

45
00:02:55,196 --> 00:03:05,263
Speaker 0: I want to do any competing endoscopes the one that has the iPhone and Android app and has the hook and the magnet and has a light on the light on the front and it's real stiff.

46
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:08,116
Speaker 0: so I can like put it straight up if I want but also long enough.

47
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,414
Speaker 0: yeah well one of them is crazy long but it's crazy expensive but I digress.

48
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:17,760
Speaker 0: so then I'm going around the kitchen and I can't look figure out where it's coming from.

49
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:37,784
Speaker 0: like it's getting really irritating and unnerving I start like opening cabinets and double-checking and then as I'm walking across the kitchen again I suddenly remember there's a sack of potatoes on the like just sitting out and I go over and I sniff the bag and I smell it a little stronger and I open the bag and I sniff it.

50
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,377
Speaker 1: mildew country just throw down potatoes out.

51
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:45,271
Speaker 0: so but those are pretty new potatoes from the CSA.

52
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,576
Speaker 0: they're like really nice potatoes.

53
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,911
Speaker 1: so well I mean the CSA might not be the cleanest.

54
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:50,574
Speaker 0: yeah.

55
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:56,083
Speaker 0: so what I do is I open it up because the thing is usually when potatoes go bad they smell like a rotting human corpse.

56
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,536
Speaker 0: they smell bad but this just smelled like mildew.

57
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:01,804
Speaker 0: it did not smell like rotting potato.

58
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:09,754
Speaker 0: so what I do is I put a big bowl in the sink and I dumped the entire potato sack in and two of the potatoes out.

59
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:19,778
Speaker 0: of like 20 potatoes two of them had the consistency of a rotten fruit and when I squished one of basically exploded into mush.

60
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:20,762
Speaker 0: that smelled like mildew.

61
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:22,892
Speaker 0: so yeah that was horrible.

62
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:31,489
Speaker 1: yeah this is the difference between you know CSA food and grocery food but also but but that so only two of these potatoes had this problem.

63
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:32,899
Speaker 0: the rest like I washed them all.

64
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,952
Speaker 0: they were all totally must have been attacked by something.

65
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:39,990
Speaker 0: yeah but I've never in my life had a potato go bad in that manner ever.

66
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:44,308
Speaker 1: also I guess that that's weird that the construction wasn't anything.

67
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,019
Speaker 0: yeah the construction was a red herring.

68
00:04:46,079 --> 00:05:00,704
Speaker 0: the probably the other thing is in New York especially if you smell a smell and there is even a remotely yeah like if there's a remotely plausible source for the smell I'll assume it's that unless the smell persists or causes it's almost a problem.

69
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,199
Speaker 1: cuz like I could be in my apartment and smell pee or something.

70
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,856
Speaker 1: yeah I guess there's like a homeless bum outside or something.

71
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:11,416
Speaker 1: it's like no I actually peed in my apartment on something I wouldn't know.

72
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:18,573
Speaker 0: so yeah actually a couple weeks ago I was sitting in this room and I suddenly smelled a little bit of cigarette smoke.

73
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,501
Speaker 0: now I was like oh fuck no.

74
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:27,045
Speaker 0: and I look out the window and there is one person three stories down and these are tall stories.

75
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:33,897
Speaker 0: so it's like five stories down in like a non New York building like that's how four and a half by their normal size stories.

76
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:40,086
Speaker 0: now you forget how high the ceilings are here and our series my scene and our first floor is almost two stories.

77
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:52,466
Speaker 0: sure cuz I got the highness something like four and a half stories up give or take and there's someone way down and way across in that like area where there's the construction smoking like one cigarette mm-hmm.

78
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,796
Speaker 0: so I open the window and I yelled at him and he flipped me off.

79
00:05:55,239 --> 00:06:01,162
Speaker 0: but then the next day a whole bunch of no smoking signs appeared in that entire area down there mm-hmm.

80
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:04,738
Speaker 1: so yeah you're not allowed to smoke in construction areas.

81
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,784
Speaker 0: oh no no that's so.

82
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:06,810
Speaker 0: it's not construction anymore.

83
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,512
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to smoke anywhere on this building's property except in your own apartment.

84
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,521
Speaker 1: you can smoke in your own apartment.

85
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:16,059
Speaker 0: yeah this building is not one of these smoke-free buildings unfortunately.

86
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:24,935
Speaker 0: but really yeah most buildings are not really mine is yeah most new buildings are but this building is not as new.

87
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:25,919
Speaker 0: it's rent stabilized.

88
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:28,832
Speaker 0: but technically you're allowed to smoke in your building.

89
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:37,049
Speaker 0: but to this building's credit the only time I've ever smelled anyone smoking anything in their apartment it's been marijuana mm-hmm.

90
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,328
Speaker 0: I have never actually smelled cigarette smoke coming out of an apartment mm-hmm.

91
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,479
Speaker 0: so and the person who was smoking on?

92
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,655
Speaker 0: they're pretty sure they did not live in any of these buildings.

93
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,523
Speaker 0: so yeah that's mine.

94
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:48,266
Speaker 0: that's my story.

95
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:49,371
Speaker 0: okay that's all I got.

96
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,881
Speaker 0: all right you got it.

97
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,786
Speaker 0: had anything happen to you?

98
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:56,019
Speaker 0: or should we get right into gaming living?

99
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,915
Speaker 0: so in the news there's this game called PUBG player unknown battleground.

100
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:02,800
Speaker 0: we've talked about it.

101
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,408
Speaker 1: it's the biggest deal right now.

102
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,123
Speaker 1: we might not be able to avoid it cuz it's such a big deal.

103
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:10,381
Speaker 0: I almost played it the other night or the other evening but the weather is nice.

104
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:15,204
Speaker 0: I biked instead but the game feels like it's got things I hate in games like.

105
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:26,786
Speaker 0: I think there's some iron sites type aiming stuff like some RMA stuff but at the same time it's also a battle royale which is just a fascinating concept in games mm-hmm.

106
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:37,330
Speaker 0: so the only reason I haven't played it yet does not seven at a time like it's one of those games that I feel like if I play it at all it'll be immediately apparent if it's bad and if it's not bad I'm probably gonna play it a lot.

107
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:42,422
Speaker 1: yeah so the deal is someone else noticed.

108
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,872
Speaker 1: hey PUBG is like a huge fucking deal right now.

109
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,842
Speaker 1: yeah I think PUBG is not quite indie.

110
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:53,320
Speaker 1: I read an article about the guy who made PUBG and he was a modder.

111
00:07:53,681 --> 00:08:01,449
Speaker 1: right it was a mod originally but then he sort of got hired and went to work with you know somewhat real game studios.

112
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,000
Speaker 0: well that's how counter-strike came about.

113
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:10,430
Speaker 1: this is a similar story to that right where you know it's a PUBG itself is not some in mod anymore that some guy made.

114
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,395
Speaker 1: it's actually like this.

115
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:16,984
Speaker 1: you know he's the leader of the team that makes it but you know he went to get a real game studio to make PUBG.

116
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,834
Speaker 1: the mod he made is not PUBG.

117
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,746
Speaker 1: it's like a. you know I think it was called.

118
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:23,967
Speaker 1: it might have had the same name but it was like on a different engine and was crap.

119
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,213
Speaker 1: you don't want to play that no one's playing.

120
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,517
Speaker 1: yeah anyway.

121
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,649
Speaker 1: so they know people noticed.

122
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,238
Speaker 1: hey this is the number one game on Steam.

123
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,029
Speaker 1: it's like the number one game period right now.

124
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:46,294
Speaker 1: that's pretty good and other game studios that have more resources in such just added this game mode to their games or made similar games that are basically the same fucking thing.

125
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,183
Speaker 0: now I'm a big fan of.

126
00:08:48,584 --> 00:09:06,908
Speaker 0: I'm glad that chicken dinner is coming back into the lexicon because of this game because that is how people would describe victories in sort of the predecessors of these games like gun game and counter-strike the or old death matches where there's a ton of players not even overwatch deathmatch which is just eight people.

127
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:13,553
Speaker 0: we're talking like there is ten to twenty people in a game and it's long and in the end only one.

128
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,940
Speaker 1: I mean this is nothing new right?

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,705
Speaker 1: it's like you know even though you know was Mario Brothers even the first platforming game.

130
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:20,750
Speaker 1: right it's all it was.

131
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:33,410
Speaker 1: it's basically one step above pitfall right I have some arguments about what the first platforming game is right but regardless of which one it is right are you gonna say oh no no no those Janice sisters cannot be or are you know?

132
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:39,046
Speaker 1: it's like they made her somebody at a racing game and then someone else makes a racing game and gonna be like no no no you can't do that right.

133
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:43,068
Speaker 1: it's like yep you know they made as a space invaders and then there was a Galaga.

134
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:43,611
Speaker 1: you can't be like.

135
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,119
Speaker 1: no no Galaga is allowed.

136
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:57,169
Speaker 0: we already made a space invader especially because you know when it comes to games in general it game design game mechanics game rules none of those things are really covered by copyright.

137
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,806
Speaker 1: and regardless of law I guess this is mostly a legal issue.

138
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:04,340
Speaker 1: but even without law it's like you can.

139
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:07,292
Speaker 1: you can make the same kind of game that someone else has already made.

140
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,051
Speaker 1: Magic the Gathering is not the only collectible card game right you know.

141
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:16,807
Speaker 1: just even without taking law into account you can't own a concept.

142
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:23,773
Speaker 0: no where on earth can you own a concept when Dominion sort of made deck builder of genre?

143
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:28,652
Speaker 1: even people who really believe in strong intellectual property and whatnot recognize?

144
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,177
Speaker 1: you can't own a concept.

145
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:37,107
Speaker 1: yep so as best I can tell like imagine if like the first person with a jazz song is like no one else may make jazz.

146
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,419
Speaker 0: I own jazz doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

147
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,964
Speaker 1: you can't write so anyway.

148
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,790
Speaker 1: so but what hat?

149
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,593
Speaker 1: what's happened here?

150
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:50,957
Speaker 1: this news story is that epic games the people who make the Unreal Engine right.

151
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,532
Speaker 1: you know cuz pub G is on the Unreal Engine I'm pretty sure right?

152
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:56,982
Speaker 0: think so yeah I don't know a lot about it.

153
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:03,262
Speaker 1: yep but epic games that makes the Unreal Engine made this game using the Unreal Engine.

154
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:09,139
Speaker 1: that is really really really really really battle royale.

155
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,616
Speaker 1: that is ridiculously similar to pub G to the point at which it's like.

156
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,203
Speaker 1: alright this isn't like I made a FPS and you made a FPS or I made capture the flag and you made capture the flag.

157
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:27,469
Speaker 1: this is like you squeaked out of pub G. yeah and I and they basically think what happened.

158
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,731
Speaker 1: I'm not.

159
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,614
Speaker 1: I didn't read and I don't remember because this was already a date many days old news story.

160
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:36,275
Speaker 1: I think they got the game out on other platforms besides PC before pub G would.

161
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,030
Speaker 1: it was able to do that and that's why it's sort of like.

162
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,311
Speaker 1: you know.

163
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,785
Speaker 1: it's trying to conquer some territory that way.

164
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:53,635
Speaker 0: yep I mean it's interesting is on one hand most of this kind of thing that happens are those garbage fake games on phones that try to look like a game that grandma's heard of so it gets bought.

165
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:54,923
Speaker 1: that's actually what this looks like.

166
00:11:55,204 --> 00:12:01,661
Speaker 1: yeah it does have that kind of graphic design like huh if you're epic games you make the Unreal Engine shouldn't be able to make a better game.

167
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:12,971
Speaker 0: but I'll be honest when it comes to this sort of thing I'm of the opinion that that sucks and whichever one of them is better is gonna win like kind of like how an idea is worth nothing.

168
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,156
Speaker 0: only execution matters.

169
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:28,633
Speaker 0: if someone has an idea for a kind of game but doesn't execute it fully and someone else takes the same idea and executes it better they're gonna win and that's probably that's the fastest way to evolve games.

170
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:29,879
Speaker 1: yeah but I think there's.

171
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,744
Speaker 1: there might be some legal action or there is gonna be some legal action or something.

172
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,332
Speaker 0: I feel like that's not gonna get very far.

173
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:51,957
Speaker 1: I'm not a lawyer there's no advice but if there is I definitely want to keep a close eyeball on that because that could have repercussions elsewhere seeing how that turns out in the blog post announcing the version under the Fortnite team byline epic rights.

174
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,487
Speaker 0: we love battle royale games like PUBG and thought Fortnite would make a great foundation for our own version.

175
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:05,933
Speaker 0: so they preemptively started calling them battle royale games to imply that that is a genre.

176
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,245
Speaker 1: well everyone knows that is a battle royale game.

177
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:11,000
Speaker 1: because I mean can battle royale the whoever wrote the book?

178
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,034
Speaker 1: I don't know the author's name can they go after PUBG?

179
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:20,720
Speaker 1: yeah right what about the Hunger Games the Hunger Games if all they should go after Hunger Games before they go after PUBG?

180
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:23,653
Speaker 1: battle royale is real old.

181
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,299
Speaker 1: it's like 1998 99 something like that is like.

182
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:26,122
Speaker 1: that book is not new.

183
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,040
Speaker 0: it's interesting that movie is actually way old.

184
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:35,579
Speaker 0: yep well I actually watched the third mood like the end move.

185
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,509
Speaker 0: I guess the third movie is actually two movies.

186
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,313
Speaker 0: so there's four movies.

187
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:39,177
Speaker 1: a third one.

188
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:45,883
Speaker 1: I thought the second one was such like insane Oh garbage like crazier than Mamoru Oshii.

189
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,956
Speaker 1: live-action crazy that I did not proceed any further.

190
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:55,372
Speaker 1: but the first one is still a the first one's fine very important and terrific movie that you should see with Takeshi Kitano.

191
00:13:55,593 --> 00:14:07,756
Speaker 1: the rest of them makes everything good pretty much just there is only one battle royale movie no and it only has one sibling movie which is the only matrix movie that there is.

192
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:11,488
Speaker 0: do not ever read the battle royale manga.

193
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,435
Speaker 0: I cannot stress this enough.

194
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:16,185
Speaker 1: I haven't read more than like one page of.

195
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:19,983
Speaker 0: no matter how vile you might think it is it will surprise you.

196
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,257
Speaker 1: I've actually haven't read the book and it's kind of big.

197
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:23,989
Speaker 1: so I've always wondered like is it worth reading?

198
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:25,700
Speaker 1: but you know maybe I check it out one day.

199
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,585
Speaker 1: maybe that'd be a book.

200
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:29,678
Speaker 1: good book club battle royale the book yeah.

201
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:38,011
Speaker 0: so uh yeah I will see how this goes because it's very interesting because the other similar quote-unquote controversy has been going on.

202
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:45,310
Speaker 0: is people talking about how battle-born and overwatch competed with each other even though they're ostensibly very different kinds of games.

203
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,222
Speaker 1: well there's that lawbreakers thing too that yeah.

204
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,629
Speaker 0: so I feel like this topic.

205
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:58,609
Speaker 0: I kind of the reason we made this a news is that I don't really have any stake in the PUBG battle and I feel like whichever games better is gonna win.

206
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:02,166
Speaker 0: I feel like lawsuits in either direction are gonna go nowhere.

207
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:22,025
Speaker 0: but at the same time I feel like this is gonna crack the seal on this sort of issue being talked about more seriously in the games industry because there is definitely the trend from the old days of someone invents a kind of game and then there's a billion copycats immediately to try to sponge off of that.

208
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:26,348
Speaker 0: I feel like that is accelerating as a pace rapidly and I don't know what's gonna happen.

209
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:30,592
Speaker 1: but usually in the past the copycats have always been worse right than the original.

210
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:44,617
Speaker 1: but if we get into situations where one developer with tons of resources right sees a really great game from someone without a lot of resources you know back in the day like you know you would hire the portal like the person who made portal.

211
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:51,795
Speaker 1: that was like some demo or something or some art project or whatever and then valve hired them and they made the real portal cynical counterpoint.

212
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:52,820
Speaker 0: but if you don't

213
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:01,863
Speaker 1: somebody sees someone's doing a thing and then suddenly just goes off and beats them at their own game because they got mad money's that's maybe not so cool ah

214
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:09,958
Speaker 0: but at the same time if you feel like you don't need to hire that original person or creative team what did they actually do other than have the idea?

215
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:14,946
Speaker 0: mm-hmm I mean they are the only thing they've done really is market research for you as well.

216
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:22,215
Speaker 1: well you'd also hope that you know they've learned lessons already because they've been working on it for so long and you can avoid having to learn those lessons yourself if you hire them.

217
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:23,078
Speaker 0: yeah.

218
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,594
Speaker 0: but also kind of the side thing is games themselves.

219
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:30,313
Speaker 0: you know because I'm kind of a UX expert that's a lot of what I do in my professional life.

220
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,600
Speaker 0: games don't have UX.

221
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:40,612
Speaker 0: they sort of are UX meaning all these salient parts of a game are explorable by anyone even someone trying to rip the game off.

222
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:51,918
Speaker 0: the parts that aren't explorable are like engineering and architecture pieces primarily that any confident person if you hire the right team could sort of put together on their own usually.

223
00:16:53,785 --> 00:17:00,236
Speaker 0: but you can fully explore the user experience or what the game is like and what features work and don't without permission from anyone.

224
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,548
Speaker 0: so we'll see where this all goes.

225
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:09,518
Speaker 0: but I feel like this topic is gonna get talked about more and more and more over the next couple years and we'll see what happens.

226
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,046
Speaker 0: mm-hmm in some other news.

227
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,421
Speaker 0: there's some trouble in the Smash Brothers scene.

228
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,449
Speaker 1: that scene always has trouble.

229
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:19,935
Speaker 1: it's like the most drama of all.

230
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,833
Speaker 1: yeah like and I'm even at all scenes but it is always a drama-filled scene.

231
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:31,583
Speaker 0: like I feel like the smash scene has drama above and beyond the fighting game scene within which it resides.

232
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:32,687
Speaker 1: well I think it's.

233
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:36,230
Speaker 1: also it's always felt like it's next to the fighting game scene and not really in it.

234
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:43,143
Speaker 1: cuz smash is so different from say Street Fighter or MVC or yeah but MVC and Bushido Blade are completely different games.

235
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:45,434
Speaker 1: yeah but Bushido Blade doesn't have any community.

236
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:48,907
Speaker 1: so that's me I don't think you're.

237
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:51,200
Speaker 1: actually I think you've actually had to play Bushido Blade.

238
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,147
Speaker 1: you just get your ass kicked.

239
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:55,370
Speaker 1: yeah probably the thing is you know you probably don't even remember the control.

240
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,234
Speaker 0: nope not at all.

241
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:57,340
Speaker 0: you know what I remember.

242
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,759
Speaker 0: if you if you have a throwing like you're just like the idea of Bushido Blade.

243
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,169
Speaker 1: you're like actual Bushido Blade.

244
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:14,034
Speaker 0: no the problem is I like Bushido Blade but when I say I there's an asterisk and that asterisk says rim a long time ago through the filter of memory and age anyway.

245
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,992
Speaker 1: but smash is like such a different game and attracts a different crowd.

246
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:21,477
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of crossover between like smash melee masters and Street Fighter masters.

247
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:27,354
Speaker 1: right but a lot of times you'll see Street Fighter masters you know playing some other fighting games and also being really damn good at them.

248
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,949
Speaker 0: but smash people are only smash as far as I can tell.

249
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,988
Speaker 1: yeah well they might play other games but usually you don't see them too much.

250
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,243
Speaker 0: so there's a pretty serious problem for that community.

251
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,156
Speaker 0: that is not a problem for any other fighting game community.

252
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:50,590
Speaker 1: the problem is the old GameCube controller which is a great controller even though it looks weird and when everyone saw it for the first time was like what the fuck yep then you put your hands on it.

253
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,357
Speaker 0: it's like when Morty experienced true level.

254
00:18:52,377 --> 00:19:01,630
Speaker 0: you're like oh like to this day because I played more Soul Calibur when Soul Calibur 2 was out on this controller.

255
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,781
Speaker 1: I can't play Soul Calibur 2 on a different controller.

256
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:13,582
Speaker 0: I guess I could get used to it but it would be difficult for me to play a Soul Calibur game because I'm a vertical attack my horizontal attack and it just mapped so nicely.

257
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:19,265
Speaker 0: but Nintendo has now made a GameCube of controllers in a long ass time.

258
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:25,233
Speaker 1: no they've been out of manufacture for quite a while because no one has a GameCube anymore that you even sell Wii's anymore.

259
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:34,863
Speaker 0: and unlike the N64 smash community which does exist and has its own problems let's stay away from them.

260
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:47,490
Speaker 0: yeah that that's that's like the people who still play Counter Strike 1 6 in here 2017 but because the GameCube controller could still be plugged into the Wii and the Wii U really the Wii U?

261
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:47,933
Speaker 1: I didn't know.

262
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,240
Speaker 0: I heard that's what this article said.

263
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,723
Speaker 0: the Wii U?

264
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:50,850
Speaker 0: okay I don't know.

265
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,655
Speaker 0: I didn't verify that.

266
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,083
Speaker 0: cuz of course why would I have a Wii U?

267
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:54,491
Speaker 1: I never used a Wii U quote.

268
00:19:54,752 --> 00:20:10,111
Speaker 0: the aging GameCube controller is a smash staple not just for melee but for the two more recent games in the franchise which were released for the Wii and the Wii U. so that means that it's not just people who grew up in the GameCube era are used to this controller and everyone else in the smash community moved on.

269
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:15,753
Speaker 1: people who play Smash Wii also need GameCube controllers even though it's a Wii game.

270
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,079
Speaker 0: but Nintendo didn't keep making them.

271
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,018
Speaker 0: no they let you plug them in but they didn't let you make them which there are.

272
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,491
Speaker 1: there are Wii pro controllers you could use.

273
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,314
Speaker 1: they're not good.

274
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,097
Speaker 1: they're not good.

275
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,342
Speaker 1: not GameCube controller good.

276
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:32,406
Speaker 0: so smash community basically has this problem of its final destination Fox.

277
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,233
Speaker 0: only GameCube controller.

278
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:36,663
Speaker 0: first party no mods only mm-hmm.

279
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:38,189
Speaker 0: the fuck are they gonna do?

280
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:45,458
Speaker 0: because there will always be any given day fewer functional GameCube controllers than there were before.

281
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:49,638
Speaker 1: well you can just fix one and you can also not fucking destroy them right?

282
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:52,754
Speaker 0: it's like they were out like even a mouse like a fancy mouse.

283
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:53,216
Speaker 0: you'll see.

284
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:56,754
Speaker 0: they have mean time before failure like how many times can you click?

285
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:58,965
Speaker 0: a couple million you don't click too hard.

286
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:00,372
Speaker 0: a lot of no it's not a matter.

287
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,061
Speaker 0: don't click too hard as a matter of entropy.

288
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:04,353
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you can there.

289
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,825
Speaker 1: you can behave in such a way to make them last longer.

290
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:08,654
Speaker 0: yeah but not that doesn't matter.

291
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,020
Speaker 1: obviously not going to be.

292
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,777
Speaker 0: that longer would have been last from the GameCube era.

293
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:19,902
Speaker 0: through the Wii era you can also the GameCube era the Wii era the Wii U era and now the switch air.

294
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:20,986
Speaker 1: you can also repair them.

295
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:28,214
Speaker 1: so easier said than done if you got a 3d printer and you got a soldering iron you can repair a controller.

296
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:30,482
Speaker 0: uh yeah but it's difficult.

297
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:35,143
Speaker 0: and two if it's not a first party controller and someone's cracked it open and soldered it.

298
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,073
Speaker 0: ah you know they didn't cheat.

299
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:39,104
Speaker 1: you check the controller.

300
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,290
Speaker 0: how do you how you gonna look at that?

301
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,496
Speaker 0: tell me if that's legit or not.

302
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:42,139
Speaker 1: you write it.

303
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,486
Speaker 1: you get a piece of software.

304
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:51,863
Speaker 0: you think the smash community who's built their entire existence around console gaming as opposed to a PC is capable of that.

305
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:52,908
Speaker 1: this is you know you get.

306
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:56,188
Speaker 1: there's plenty of we mods we has been homebrewed and hacked for quite a while.

307
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:03,512
Speaker 1: you make a little we app where someone plugs in a GameCube controller and you have to push all the buttons and then it tells you whether the GameCube controller is legit or not.

308
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:04,656
Speaker 0: so there are.

309
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:28,736
Speaker 0: so if you read this article you'll find out there's actually significant specific reasons why they're very difficult to repair because the kinds of repairs that were easy are already done all the time and now they're so old that they're failing in other ways and it's starting to come down to like was it from the beginning of the manufacturing run or the end of the manufacturing run?

310
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:33,279
Speaker 1: well I got a bunch of give controllers and I'm gonna hold on to them until the smash melee.

311
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,153
Speaker 1: people are so desperate they'll pay me like a fortune for it.

312
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:41,094
Speaker 0: I feel like Nintendo could make some money but they won't because they don't care.

313
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:44,212
Speaker 0: they don't want to be in the non console hardware business.

314
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,002
Speaker 1: somebody will eventually right.

315
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:51,941
Speaker 1: just make something that lets you use like a Wii pro controller on the.

316
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:52,423
Speaker 1: you know it's like.

317
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:56,764
Speaker 0: oh no it's got to be this exact shape or that community is gonna freak out.

318
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,594
Speaker 1: well you're gonna have to give up at some point.

319
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:04,060
Speaker 1: right since we talked about this I think story earlier where the arcade people are running out of CRT's.

320
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,847
Speaker 0: yeah or DDR?

321
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:09,545
Speaker 0: if you're an aficionado of dance dance revolution good fucking luck.

322
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:16,347
Speaker 1: getting a good dance pad you know at the foot of my bed is a bunch of junk I'm trying to get rid of and I'm actually make gonna make some headway now on that.

323
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,056
Speaker 0: you're not getting rid of your red octane are ya?

324
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,446
Speaker 0: you don't play DDR anymore.

325
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:20,728
Speaker 0: is that?

326
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:24,789
Speaker 1: haven't use that red octane in so long and I don't know if it works a hundred percent.

327
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,257
Speaker 1: I think it might have some bad arrows.

328
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,447
Speaker 0: yeah well I have three working.

329
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:29,773
Speaker 1: you can try to fix mine if you want.

330
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:36,623
Speaker 1: yeah anyway but the at the foot of my bed though is a plastic guitar hero guitar for the Wii.

331
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:40,178
Speaker 0: yeah you can just throw that shit away and it's like but what it wait but what.

332
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:44,774
Speaker 0: but what if that community is not the same as the smash community?

333
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:47,864
Speaker 0: that ship sailed and sank.

334
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,442
Speaker 1: but if I feel like playing guitar hero though one day I still have the game.

335
00:23:51,683 --> 00:24:02,823
Speaker 0: so there's a longer meta story like meta story here on the top about eSports in general and smash will never be a top-tier esport for reasons like this.

336
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:07,258
Speaker 0: yeah consoles cannot without making them effectively.

337
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:17,820
Speaker 0: pcs support modern eSports because modern eSports requires significant spectator infrastructure and significant anti cheating and uniformity infrastructure.

338
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,632
Speaker 0: you're not gonna get that with any kind of consoles.

339
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:29,195
Speaker 1: even like games that are eSports which are supported by the companies that make the games have really shitty and subpar infrastructure.

340
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:31,146
Speaker 1: there's a game I've talked about it before.

341
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,943
Speaker 1: I have yet to actually play it though I do have access to it.

342
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,492
Speaker 0: I have to just that Amazon one right.

343
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,269
Speaker 1: I just had to be home on one of the weekends where you can play it.

344
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:39,393
Speaker 1: it's called breakaway.

345
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:49,576
Speaker 1: it's made by Amazon who owns twitch by Amazon Game Studios and basically it looks like a MOBA but there's a ball and the goal is to get the ball to the other end.

346
00:24:49,616 --> 00:25:01,273
Speaker 1: so it's a sport but also a MOBA kind of thing and they are building the game from the ground up with eSports and spectating and streaming it as like the first priority and that just makes it interesting.

347
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:13,740
Speaker 1: cuz like well if you're good at that even if the game doesn't get popular maybe you could mooch off some Amazon twitch monies by being like the king of this game or something right that no one currently even cares about like the forum has like no one in it the official forum.

348
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,540
Speaker 1: so you know I'm not saying I'm not promoting that game.

349
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:18,306
Speaker 1: I didn't know what's good.

350
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:20,077
Speaker 1: I haven't played it yet I just have it downloaded.

351
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:24,622
Speaker 1: but that's the kind of thing that you're gonna need for eSports going forward.

352
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:42,369
Speaker 0: but here's the other thing that's interesting when it comes to preservation of old experiences like old Atari 2600. the controllers are so simple that people can effectively repair them indefinitely in a way that they really can't do with the GameCube type stuff.

353
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:48,731
Speaker 1: but also there are enough GameCube controllers that in forever right at least.

354
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,118
Speaker 0: no no not forever.

355
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:54,115
Speaker 1: you see that's the kind of um you know it's a museum that is preserving game.

356
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,552
Speaker 0: that's the kind of like we'll be always post-apocalyptic thinking.

357
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:02,266
Speaker 1: they always have at least one working game cube controller together.

358
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,442
Speaker 0: until all the canned food runs out it's out.

359
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:11,562
Speaker 0: but there's gonna be a time where the last GameCube controller is buried by the Lorax.

360
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:13,629
Speaker 1: no no there is.

361
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:14,993
Speaker 0: that day will come now.

362
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,871
Speaker 1: but with the Atari and all that as long as there are people who care about preserving GameCube controllers there will be one in a museum.

363
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:32,906
Speaker 0: almost every other semi-professional or serious community around a legacy console game has ways to make do that.

364
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:41,576
Speaker 0: the smash community has uniquely tied itself to a limited number of consoles and a limited number of a very specific controller.

365
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:52,798
Speaker 1: something else is that you know Nintendo did at certain points make promotional items of basically Super Nintendo controller replicas that were just plugged into wii's.

366
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:03,930
Speaker 1: true I can definitely see on like GameCube anniversary them releasing like GameCube controllers that work on a newer system or whatever they and then people will just make adapters for them.

367
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,059
Speaker 1: you know they're definitely going to be within our lifetime the GameCube.

368
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,742
Speaker 1: a GameCube similar controller will be manufactured as some sort of novelty by Nintendo.

369
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:13,888
Speaker 1: cuz that's how they do so.

370
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:21,602
Speaker 1: yet another issue here is that because this community they just made NES classic and SNES classic one day GameCube would be so old.

371
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:26,828
Speaker 1: they'll be GameCube classic because this game n64 classic isn't coming within like you know.

372
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,497
Speaker 1: so Scott there's another problem here.

373
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:36,509
Speaker 0: next year Christmas n64 classic bet on it because this community is so obsessed with this controller being intrinsic part of the game.

374
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:43,117
Speaker 0: they've also basically prevented any amount of handicap accessibility that's in their scene.

375
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:48,987
Speaker 0: that's a shame in a way that fighting games have embraced I mean with the fight sticks and all the alternative inputs.

376
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:53,142
Speaker 0: yep so GameCube controllers have caused people some injuries.

377
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:57,941
Speaker 1: well they've also not only denying disabled people from playing a game.

378
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:01,462
Speaker 1: you're just denying people from playing your game if they can't get the equipment.

379
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,055
Speaker 1: yeah it's just like oh sorry you weren't a kid.

380
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:07,315
Speaker 1: when GameCubes are out and you don't have a bunch of money to buy one from someone.

381
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:14,635
Speaker 0: sorry get tennis rackets were only manufactured between 2001 and 2009 so I guess you can't ever play tennis unless you buy some old tennis racket on eBay.

382
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,123
Speaker 1: yeah you can't play this game.

383
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:17,509
Speaker 1: it's not for sale anymore.

384
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,660
Speaker 1: sorry oh you want to play this collectible card game that they don't print anymore but it's still a big deal.

385
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:23,663
Speaker 1: that's a shame.

386
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:30,532
Speaker 0: so yeah I guess the moral is the smash community is really really weird and this is just kind of funny.

387
00:28:30,552 --> 00:28:40,948
Speaker 0: there's more just more examples of their weirdness but anyway things of the day.

388
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:44,092
Speaker 0: so way back we had to have made this a thing of the day.

389
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:44,937
Speaker 0: there's a definitely

390
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:45,540
Speaker 1: thing of the day

391
00:28:45,922 --> 00:29:07,427
Speaker 0: but Wintergatan is this amazing YouTube channel slash person who makes really complicated musical experiences and the most famous one is this giant machine that just plays music with marbles and it's amazing and this person is currently working on a much more elaborate and interesting version of that machine.

392
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:16,368
Speaker 0: but as an aside they do a bunch of awesome stuff and they made this video using an instrument they developed and a bunch of other instruments to play dr.

393
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:32,654
Speaker 0: Wiley's castle theme from Megaman 2. and not only is it fascinating to see how he made this music but it sounds really good it's accurate and it gave me some Megaman feels reminded me how much I like Megaman 2's music usually a homemade instrument.

394
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:37,065
Speaker 1: you know you get like some hard drives playing some music or something and it's not really doesn't sound that impressive.

395
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:37,930
Speaker 0: this sounds great.

396
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,018
Speaker 1: it sounds incredible for this thing.

397
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:40,942
Speaker 1: it's like whoa.

398
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,769
Speaker 0: yeah it's good stuff.

399
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:44,134
Speaker 0: so what you got?

400
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:45,739
Speaker 1: so here's an.

401
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,525
Speaker 1: I guess it's an art installation.

402
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:50,054
Speaker 0: I guess as we call it that this count says so.

403
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:51,802
Speaker 1: basically I think it's in Germany right.

404
00:29:51,822 --> 00:30:05,142
Speaker 1: a bunch of people decided to entertain the train passengers by doing stuff out in the empty fields outside the train window the idea being like hey you're riding the train stop just looking at your phone.

405
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:06,669
Speaker 1: instead look out the window.

406
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:09,965
Speaker 1: we're gonna do fun stuff as the train passes by for like a whole day.

407
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:17,890
Speaker 1: and it was a great community event because all the people who live in these farm areas got together and met each other and you know had a good time working on this together.

408
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:27,820
Speaker 1: so there's one more like a bunch of people are behind bushes they're holding bushes and when the train comes they start running until Pernham Wood comes to Dunstanane right you know.

409
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,227
Speaker 1: and there's like this one.

410
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,827
Speaker 1: you know it's all kinds of interesting ones but the the most the craziest one was.

411
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:42,701
Speaker 1: a bunch of people get in a costume and all look like the same person and they pretend to basically be having a race with the train.

412
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,247
Speaker 1: it's like you know the person.

413
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:55,040
Speaker 1: the first person runs and then jumps and then you can't see them anymore and then another person comes out from behind something with the same costume and runs and it looks like the person.

414
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,112
Speaker 1: it basically creates the illusion that someone is racing and beating the train in a foot race even though it's a crazy fast train.

415
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:09,332
Speaker 1: these are shockingly elaborate and at the very end at the train station there's like someone there like already you know who's wearing the costumes.

416
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:14,036
Speaker 1: it looks like they beat the trains at the train station but they basically did this whole thing.

417
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:19,566
Speaker 1: all these all these different scenes and acts were repeated you know for all the trains throughout the day.

418
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:26,160
Speaker 1: they think they did it for like a few hours or whatever so you can have all the fun of riding these trains just by watching this YouTube video.

419
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:32,070
Speaker 0: yeah one of my favorite I mean these are this really is more installation like you said than prank.

420
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:38,801
Speaker 0: but my favorite pranks in the world are do something weird where someone questions reality a little bit and they can't explain it.

421
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:39,665
Speaker 1: this isn't a prank.

422
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,208
Speaker 1: they're like they think the people on the train knew to look out for it.

423
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:44,237
Speaker 0: at least some of the people know.

424
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:50,214
Speaker 0: but imagine the person who doesn't know just like on the train like fucking down with their phone and they look up and they notice that guy.

425
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:52,867
Speaker 1: well the illusion isn't that great is the thing?

426
00:31:52,927 --> 00:32:00,902
Speaker 0: it's not it you know it's it's obvious when you look at it like how depends though because the trains moving fast you only see it for like a second.

427
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:04,175
Speaker 1: sure sure but you know like.

428
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:08,576
Speaker 0: they put that fake house up and then it's gone like the next time they go by like that kind of nonsense.

429
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:14,157
Speaker 0: hmm so yeah in the meta moment we got two videos up that you should watch.

430
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:29,136
Speaker 0: so one our pecs panel from pecs was 2017. the age of the quitter is a hundred percent on YouTube in glorious 2k because I didn't feel like uploading 50 or 60 gigabytes of 4k and you really don't need 4k of our faces.

431
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,753
Speaker 0: and Scott uploaded on his channel meaning you got described both of our channels.

432
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:40,497
Speaker 0: the first non anime Boston produced episode of geek nights judge anime by its cover.

433
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:42,365
Speaker 1: yeah it's gonna be a quarterly show.

434
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:47,851
Speaker 1: so four times a year like about a couple weeks before the new anime season starts we're gonna put up a video.

435
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:59,159
Speaker 1: we go through the anime chart at any chart net and judge based on almost no information whatsoever which anime are gonna be worth watching and which ones you should stay the hell away from.

436
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,480
Speaker 1: and we have uploaded the first episode of this show and it's only gonna get better.

437
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,214
Speaker 1: in a few months we'll do the next episode.

438
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:09,551
Speaker 0: yeah so there you go and I'm actually watching a lot of anime these days.

439
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:21,305
Speaker 0: so it's feeling good and I finally fully understand exactly what it means for a show to be a darker than black you and your darker than black.

440
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:26,925
Speaker 1: anyway the book club book is the fifth season by NK Jemisin.

441
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:29,754
Speaker 1: I finished reading it a while ago.

442
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:30,958
Speaker 0: I've been busy.

443
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,303
Speaker 1: how are you doing so?

444
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:38,591
Speaker 0: I'm only like five chapters in because uh-huh I don't have a commute anymore like it takes me like ten minutes to get to work.

445
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:43,460
Speaker 1: there's other times during the day that you can read like before you go to bed when you wake up.

446
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,654
Speaker 0: ah but I've been busy when you're at work not doing work.

447
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:48,744
Speaker 0: ah so that's the thing my new job.

448
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:50,272
Speaker 0: I've been doing work the whole time I'm at work.

449
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:51,886
Speaker 1: yeah I'm just saying there's time you know.

450
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:55,403
Speaker 1: when you're sitting somewhere waiting for something you know whatever.

451
00:33:55,423 --> 00:33:57,131
Speaker 0: yeah I'll be reading it real soon.

452
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,503
Speaker 0: I'm gonna power through it because I really like what I read.

453
00:33:59,543 --> 00:33:59,925
Speaker 0: so far.

454
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,241
Speaker 0: I can see why people when they start these books.

455
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:09,873
Speaker 1: I've already started on the sequel which also won a Hugo Award just like the original which is the book that we're doing.

456
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:16,248
Speaker 1: and there is a third one which I think is the last one but I haven't at least you're not I'm only the beginning of the second one of like.

457
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:25,188
Speaker 0: I was where we both read the wheel of time one as the book club and we both just kept reading and then I just kept reading till I hit the end.

458
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:26,815
Speaker 1: I read like four or five wheel of time.

459
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:31,719
Speaker 0: yep but I I read them all and I know the full dealer Randall tar and what's up with the magic.

460
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:33,547
Speaker 1: I don't need to read anymore.

461
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:34,933
Speaker 0: yeah the problem is it.

462
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:39,172
Speaker 0: it would take me longer to summarize it then it would take you to just fucking read them.

463
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:43,446
Speaker 0: so yeah but the fifth season it's summarizing.

464
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:46,235
Speaker 0: I defy anyone to summarize the.

465
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,129
Speaker 1: I need to know the parts about the creepy tower.

466
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:51,456
Speaker 1: I don't need to know anything else.

467
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,246
Speaker 0: yeah that's really all you want to know about.

468
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:56,842
Speaker 0: yeah cuz that's the least explained of everything.

469
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,896
Speaker 1: of course the good the best part is always the least explained.

470
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:02,608
Speaker 1: that's how it always is.

471
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:07,609
Speaker 1: you fucking fantasy sci-fi people right the coolest thing should be the most explained.

472
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,587
Speaker 1: if you're watching a Star Wars movie there should be awesome Empire shit.

473
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:12,375
Speaker 1: see more than stupid rebel shit.

474
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:19,954
Speaker 1: no stupid lame-ass pussy rebels on the screen right not enough TIE fighter too much x-ray over the course of all that Prince of nothing.

475
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,724
Speaker 0: they're like Oh God or off go God or out.

476
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:32,148
Speaker 0: and then in the last book we just read there fucking is and we're just going inside this but they and then they're like oh by the way the real cool shit is actually gods haha.

477
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,297
Speaker 0: anyway well we'll see what it.

478
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,764
Speaker 0: what is a guy any other?

479
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:48,372
Speaker 1: yeah so in meta basically just go on the internet to all the places that we are all the social YouTube the social networks the YouTube channels the websites the everything and get with it.

480
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,565
Speaker 0: so we played a ton of games at PAX.

481
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:55,596
Speaker 1: oh yeah like even though PAX is already like a month ago.

482
00:35:55,616 --> 00:36:00,822
Speaker 0: if we did nothing on Tuesday shows but review games we haven't reviewed yet that we played at PAX.

483
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:04,253
Speaker 1: we'll be at PAX unplugged we'll be.

484
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:10,096
Speaker 0: we would make it past PAX South yeah without running out which I guess they got to submit the panels for that.

485
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:10,418
Speaker 0: mm-hmm.

486
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:11,926
Speaker 0: so cod pecs out.

487
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,052
Speaker 0: this coming up mm-hmm.

488
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:15,021
Speaker 0: yeah X unplugged is coming up.

489
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,272
Speaker 0: exos is coming up but we're skipping it this year.

490
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:18,156
Speaker 0: mm-hmm.

491
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,568
Speaker 0: we were gonna go next year for sure for 01 the omega-thon.

492
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:23,084
Speaker 0: but because she only gets you got pretty deep but she didn't win.

493
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,316
Speaker 0: so I think I'm skipping one more pack sauce.

494
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:26,742
Speaker 0: but I'm feeling like 2019.

495
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:31,958
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go back to 2018. go to Essen Essen it's time.

496
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:40,545
Speaker 0: but the reason I want to review Black Friday is that it neither sounds if you don't know who made this game.

497
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:44,804
Speaker 0: it neither sounds nor looks like the kind of game that me and Scott would like.

498
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:47,599
Speaker 1: well no I mean it's a. it's a game made by Friedman free.

499
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,529
Speaker 0: oh yeah you don't know who made it.

500
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:55,737
Speaker 1: so Friedman freeze is this guy with green hair who made power grid which I think in German is called Funkin.

501
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:56,560
Speaker 0: German.

502
00:36:56,921 --> 00:37:01,940
Speaker 0: all his games all his games begin with the letter F not all of them as we learned.

503
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,663
Speaker 1: no not all.

504
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:06,278
Speaker 1: most of his games are you know FF something like fresh fish?

505
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,712
Speaker 1: yeah and they come in a green box just like his hair.

506
00:37:09,752 --> 00:37:11,159
Speaker 1: that's how you can tell when it's his game.

507
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:17,892
Speaker 1: so black market is another and I can't believe how many games this dude is made but I thought he played every game.

508
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:19,075
Speaker 1: but no there's another one.

509
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,460
Speaker 1: it's called black market.

510
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:26,646
Speaker 1: there's a black market fuck if I know all right a Black Friday.

511
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:28,012
Speaker 1: I mean is it something Friday like?

512
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:31,947
Speaker 0: I'll try to look at something else every day?

513
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:32,550
Speaker 1: or who knows?

514
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:42,401
Speaker 0: but Friedman freeze is almost tied with Canis II I think for reliably able to scratch and itch that rim and Scott have related to gaming.

515
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:46,697
Speaker 0: mm-hmm about the name of the first game in the fruit egg pro.

516
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:50,272
Speaker 0: it's in a project but here is it something.

517
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:52,666
Speaker 1: here is it from 2010 so it's pretty old it's real.

518
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:56,306
Speaker 1: but anyway I'd never seen this game before or I've never seen it in a store.

519
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:57,512
Speaker 1: I've never seen it played.

520
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,321
Speaker 1: I'd even know it existed but then there it was.

521
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:04,752
Speaker 0: we see why I'm saying that like oh this doesn't look like at surface value a game that room Scott would play.

522
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:11,065
Speaker 0: if you look at this you see a weird-looking board that looks like it's from one of those Milton Bradley kind of games in the u.s.

523
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:16,107
Speaker 0: a bunch of paper money and a bunch of nonsense and a victory track.

524
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:17,171
Speaker 1: we didn't use paper money.

525
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:17,875
Speaker 1: views chips right.

526
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:20,669
Speaker 0: yeah yes chips but paper money paper money anyway.

527
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:26,076
Speaker 1: so what this game is is about Black Friday stock market Black Friday as in the day the stock market crash right.

528
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:26,578
Speaker 1: so there's.

529
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:30,376
Speaker 1: it's really hard to explain the exact rules so I'm not going to.

530
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:38,586
Speaker 1: but basically what this game amounts to is that there is silver and over time silver will increase in value.

531
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:40,231
Speaker 1: it starts off real cheap.

532
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:42,520
Speaker 1: what like 20 bucks or something 50 50 to 100 I forget.

533
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:48,142
Speaker 0: anyway it starts off it goes from zero and it starts going up.

534
00:38:48,383 --> 00:38:48,684
Speaker 1: anyway.

535
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,577
Speaker 1: it starts off cheap and gets expensive when it hits the top.

536
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,104
Speaker 1: that's when the game ends right.

537
00:38:53,666 --> 00:39:04,439
Speaker 1: yep when silver hits its max value I'm pretty sure that's one of the things that ends the game and basically victory points is money is money but silver is basically the money you have at the end of the game.

538
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,649
Speaker 0: so you can get money and you can use that money to either buy more stocks or convert it to silver.

539
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:12,695
Speaker 0: what is it converted to silver?

540
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:14,144
Speaker 0: you can't turn it back into money.

541
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:14,748
Speaker 0: I can't sell.

542
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,256
Speaker 1: I didn't see any way to sell silver.

543
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:17,563
Speaker 0: you can't sell silver but you want.

544
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:22,027
Speaker 1: so if you in most games you're trying to figure out like all right when do I?

545
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:22,892
Speaker 1: like a Puerto Rico?

546
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:28,297
Speaker 1: I obviously early game doubloons are worth more and late-game victory points are worth more.

547
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,949
Speaker 1: obviously cuz victory points are all that matter.

548
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:36,367
Speaker 1: but if you go for victory points right away in Puerto Rico you'll have no doubloons and no barrels and then you won't be able to get more victory.

549
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,553
Speaker 0: it's like race for the galaxy.

550
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:40,888
Speaker 0: don't do the x2 consume on the second round right?

551
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:44,205
Speaker 1: you know that's how most German euro timing games work.

552
00:39:44,245 --> 00:40:07,374
Speaker 1: is that you have to build this resource engine crank it up just exactly the right amount of efficiency and then pull the levers that it starts producing victory points at the right time and the right amount but still also producing resources to get even more victory points so that you can basically completely exhaust all resources at the exact end of the game to have the most possible victory points because there's a timer in the way.

553
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:07,916
Speaker 1: it does.

554
00:40:07,956 --> 00:40:08,519
Speaker 1: no timer.

555
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,762
Speaker 1: you could just crank as hard as possible and then get a big infinite fountain of victory points.

556
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:14,626
Speaker 1: that's stupid.

557
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,112
Speaker 1: in Black Friday.

558
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:24,783
Speaker 1: if you go for victory points early you could just buy a silver right away and it's so cheap that you kind of want to.

559
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,813
Speaker 0: but your upside is at most 80.

560
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:29,480
Speaker 1: that's still a really good upside.

561
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:39,412
Speaker 1: yeah compared to you later in the game you buy one at like 90 shares of a stock that ends up being worth like 200 each right.

562
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:40,196
Speaker 1: so that's the thing.

563
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:44,796
Speaker 1: is that the only other thing you can do really is engage in the stock market.

564
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:46,864
Speaker 1: that's hella risky.

565
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:49,733
Speaker 1: it is based on pulling random cubes out of a bag.

566
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:58,357
Speaker 0: now the stock market in this game is shockingly I'm not gonna say accurate to the real stock.

567
00:40:58,377 --> 00:41:00,665
Speaker 1: it's not accurate in its mechanism.

568
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:11,534
Speaker 0: it's accurate in its motion in terms of liquidity affecting price and momentum and in terms of it's.

569
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:13,902
Speaker 0: this game is designed to form bubbles.

570
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:18,298
Speaker 0: so I start buying a stock and it goes up a little bit.

571
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:22,898
Speaker 1: so I buy a stock which means I get a cube and we put a cube in the bag and the

572
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,546
Speaker 0: same color same stock rim

573
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:43,611
Speaker 1: buys one and we put another one in the bag right and now if there's a lot of cubes in the bag this stock has a good chance of going up but then if everyone keeps buying it and the cubes come out of the bag which makes the price go up right and then people buy more cubes and the price goes up but now there's not a lot of cubes in the bag

574
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:45,862
Speaker 0: because the price is up fewer people are buying.

575
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:50,121
Speaker 0: so the game comes down to because the price went up from people buying it.

576
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,978
Speaker 1: people started selling and now there's black cubes in the bag.

577
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:58,397
Speaker 1: and when black cubes come in the ad out of the bag prices go way down.

578
00:41:58,577 --> 00:41:58,919
Speaker 0: yep.

579
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:08,216
Speaker 1: so you're trying to buy stocks that have cubes in the bag and then once the cubes come out of the bag you want to sell right away and things get cray.

580
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,929
Speaker 0: yep and a stock's price can move a significant amount.

581
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,673
Speaker 0: but all these?

582
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:19,183
Speaker 0: it's really hard to explain all the ways that stocks will move without just teaching you literally the entire.

583
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,175
Speaker 1: there's a crazy grid of numbers and they move up left down and right.

584
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:31,076
Speaker 0: it's all weird and stuff and there's things that aren't really encoded in the board that you just have to know by reading the rule book like when the third cube is taken.

585
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,647
Speaker 1: then this thing happens and we reprice all the stuff.

586
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:51,798
Speaker 0: but unlike a lot of board games the one saving grace is that as long as at least one person at the table fully understands all those rules they can facilitate all the parts of the game that are complicated and even if you don't fully understand what they're doing

587
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:55,777
Speaker 1: you can still understand enough to realize when it that you to figure out.

588
00:42:55,897 --> 00:43:16,574
Speaker 1: okay I don't completely understand which cubes are moving where but I know enough to know that this stock is bubbling that one's tanking that one's on the rise and you can just tell right before I there was like as we played the game a few times it wasn't until like towards the end of the first playthrough that I fully understood how like all the rules of all the cube movement.

589
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,683
Speaker 0: but I knew I was about to cry.

590
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:22,562
Speaker 1: I was still a hundred percent right about what was happening in the market.

591
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:24,050
Speaker 1: regardless because it moves.

592
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:32,708
Speaker 0: naturally the game is a lot of great moments like I buy a stock and Scott buys the same stock right after me there was like oh shit I won.

593
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:39,075
Speaker 1: so the first time he played I won and what happened was his rim bought a stock and then it was.

594
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:43,579
Speaker 1: then he went first and it was everyone else's turn and I said all right everyone rim bought what color?

595
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,442
Speaker 0: you forget.

596
00:43:44,503 --> 00:43:45,667
Speaker 1: it was like pretend it was blue.

597
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:47,233
Speaker 1: I'm like I listen everyone.

598
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,586
Speaker 1: let's all go in together on orange.

599
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:51,349
Speaker 1: everybody.

600
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,453
Speaker 1: orange rim went blue.

601
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:59,789
Speaker 1: if we go blue we're gonna put a bunch of blue cubes in the bag and help rim all of us orange and we'll all get a bunch of money and rim won't.

602
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,022
Speaker 1: and sure enough that's exactly what the hell happened.

603
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:04,012
Speaker 1: it was totally great and I won.

604
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:13,756
Speaker 0: so what's really fascinating too is that the game's very the game looks like and when you first start to learn it even feels like it's gonna be very fiddly number heavy in terms of like.

605
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,375
Speaker 0: someone who's not good at math could have significant analysis.

606
00:44:17,415 --> 00:44:18,823
Speaker 0: paralysis trying to decide what to do.

607
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:28,068
Speaker 1: if you try to analysis paralysis this game don't play this game but the game it's good enough to just know it's gonna go up a little up a medium up a lot down a little.

608
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:29,215
Speaker 1: you don't need to know the exact number.

609
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:34,412
Speaker 0: fascinating how well very simple heuristics on the board like.

610
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:40,792
Speaker 0: are there a lot or a small number of green cubes on deck for the green stock?

611
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:44,728
Speaker 0: are there a lot or a small number of them in this other area.

612
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,059
Speaker 0: how many black suitcases are in the bag?

613
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:48,344
Speaker 1: how many really?

614
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,312
Speaker 0: simply heuristics like that gets you?

615
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:50,472
Speaker 0: 99%?

616
00:44:50,472 --> 00:44:55,596
Speaker 0: as far as trying to calculate actual probability where is where is the price of silver?

617
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:56,259
Speaker 1: right now?

618
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,936
Speaker 0: the game seems to because the numbers are too like.

619
00:45:01,257 --> 00:45:07,525
Speaker 0: odds are really difficult to calculate to the point that I don't think anyone playing this game could feasibly do it.

620
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:22,557
Speaker 0: the fact that it's effectively impossible for the majority of players means that people won't even try to do it and this game I think is really good at fostering surprisingly nuanced heuristics and players they don't fully understand the logic of the heuristics they're using.

621
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:23,862
Speaker 1: I think another great thing was.

622
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:29,766
Speaker 1: game is simply that it has the classic drama we see so often of pulling stuff out of a bag.

623
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,058
Speaker 0: Oh bag drama is one of my favorite things.

624
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,032
Speaker 1: now Christine Euphrates what's the one with the digging for treasure?

625
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:35,555
Speaker 1: Oh 7 7 right.

626
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,919
Speaker 1: any game where you pull stuff randomly out of a bag is the awesomest right.

627
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,455
Speaker 1: I'm way into bag pulling right now so I mean even even rah.

628
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,423
Speaker 1: rah is like the worst bag pulling game.

629
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:59,292
Speaker 1: yeah but basically even though you might be there were situations where it's like I know that bag is like a hundred percent blue cubes oh my god this is gonna happen and then after they finish pulling stuff out of the black suitcase black suitcase black suitcase.

630
00:45:59,312 --> 00:46:05,413
Speaker 1: it's like all black suitcases and blue ends up going down even though it's like oh my god why.

631
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:08,422
Speaker 1: and it's you know it's.

632
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:20,093
Speaker 1: it's like crazy shit happens and you totally get boned against the odds just like in the real stock market and that creates a lot of drama which is fun even if it's not the best in terms of like.

633
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,078
Speaker 1: making it a skill game.

634
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:24,814
Speaker 1: yep but the real world is not a school skill game.

635
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:26,802
Speaker 1: it's full of luck and risk and nonsense.

636
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:38,037
Speaker 0: unlike say camel up which has a very high luck factor for that sort of drama this game has a very high skill factor despite all that nonsense because that's pretty much the only luck is the pulling things out of a bag.

637
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:40,612
Speaker 1: right now can't think of any other luck sources in the game.

638
00:46:40,954 --> 00:46:43,467
Speaker 0: well you start with an initial loadout of some stocks.

639
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:48,729
Speaker 1: oh your initial loadout is random but it effectively doesn't matter because this game is not an FF.

640
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:51,257
Speaker 0: Schwartz are free tag.

641
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:54,773
Speaker 0: okay black Friday has a F gotta be the word for Friday.

642
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:55,557
Speaker 0: so black Friday.

643
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:58,130
Speaker 1: well Schwartz definitely means black in Germanic languages.

644
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,423
Speaker 0: yep black for oh and they use currency symbols.

645
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:02,788
Speaker 0: okay that's cute mm-hmm.

646
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,444
Speaker 0: but yeah the game is just kind of like pen Dante.

647
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:25,962
Speaker 0: this game had a similar feel in the sense that this was a game that greatly exceeded my somewhat low expectations and was way more fun than I expected and as a result got way more of our precious packs tabletop hours than I expected.

648
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:28,473
Speaker 0: yes so late this game what three times?

649
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:29,035
Speaker 1: yeah?

650
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:37,515
Speaker 1: so if you're a person who likes stock market type things right and you know you like playing like one of the stock market games you buy stocks with fake money.

651
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,728
Speaker 0: oh this game is gonna scratch you so good.

652
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:43,650
Speaker 1: and then you wait for the real market to move and you play that game over like multiple days.

653
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:45,279
Speaker 1: right you see who who has the most money?

654
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,855
Speaker 1: at the end of a month everyone starts with a thousand dollars of fake money.

655
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:56,677
Speaker 1: this gives you all the more fun than that in only like a couple hours and the only thing you're missing out on is the real-world stock market stuff.

656
00:47:56,758 --> 00:48:04,256
Speaker 0: right you can play this game real quick if everyone you're playing with this smart you only need one person to 100% know all the rules.

657
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:11,932
Speaker 1: yeah that's important because that person better a hundred percent know all the rules perfectly yeah because it actually trusting them.

658
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,260
Speaker 1: you're also trusting them to not cheat.

659
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:23,662
Speaker 0: but most of the weird complexity that you might imagine this game has like I said it distills really like really simply into heuristics that are digestible.

660
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:34,242
Speaker 0: and this game in terms of the ebb and flow and deciding when to shift from money generation to better victory point money generation because it's all just money.

661
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:36,910
Speaker 0: in the end it's similar to st.

662
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,492
Speaker 0: Petersburg.

663
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:42,757
Speaker 0: yeah yeah like you have your two modes and you're flipping between them.

664
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:47,178
Speaker 1: the other great thing about this game is that the your turns are really simple.

665
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:48,083
Speaker 1: it's like comes to your turn.

666
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:49,229
Speaker 1: it's like you can buy some stock.

667
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,698
Speaker 1: yeah you can sell some stock.

668
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,985
Speaker 1: you can buy some silver.

669
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:53,473
Speaker 1: it's like there's not really.

670
00:48:53,956 --> 00:48:55,061
Speaker 1: it's a lot like ticket to ride.

671
00:48:55,081 --> 00:49:00,783
Speaker 1: we're in very modern design where you go around taking very small actions on your turn.

672
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,269
Speaker 1: there isn't a lot of like.

673
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:05,362
Speaker 1: hmm I'm gonna move this but where do I move it?

674
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:08,760
Speaker 0: kind of stuff and a consequence of that is that there's a lot of table.

675
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,227
Speaker 1: it's like I'll buy a blue cube.

676
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:10,790
Speaker 1: that's my turn.

677
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:16,740
Speaker 0: go lots of table banter and player interaction like come on Scott greens hot join me buy some green stock with me.

678
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,775
Speaker 0: we'll make out like bandits except we went against rim.

679
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,660
Speaker 1: we did the smart thing.

680
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,292
Speaker 1: don't don't get on the rim team.

681
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:25,955
Speaker 1: everyone getting up on rim and that totally worked like in that page is what you should be doing.

682
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:30,781
Speaker 1: every time I tell you to do that see how well it worked do it again every so and we play getting up on rim.

683
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:37,508
Speaker 0: in the three ongoing long-form Civ games I have the first one the big crew one that they hang up on rim.

684
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:41,304
Speaker 0: so the entire world has been at war with me for like a hundred years.

685
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,448
Speaker 1: good job world.

686
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:45,742
Speaker 0: literally the entire world is at war with me.

687
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:46,464
Speaker 1: good job world.

688
00:49:46,685 --> 00:49:47,066
Speaker 1: good job.

689
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:52,466
Speaker 0: and yet despite that the only consequence is I lost my worst city.

690
00:49:52,486 --> 00:49:54,594
Speaker 0: I'm still actually doing fine.

691
00:49:55,076 --> 00:50:01,476
Speaker 0: do better at the game people in the patreon game I feel like I'm running away with it.

692
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,161
Speaker 1: I know no one can stop.

693
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:04,889
Speaker 1: sure the other people are just not that good.

694
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:15,878
Speaker 0: so one person who I know is good just got F'd because basically Egypt was like on this continent like in a line to the south of them was me and Persia and I just rolled Persia.

695
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:19,151
Speaker 0: so I'm up on Egypt's border and Poland rolled someone.

696
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:24,571
Speaker 0: so Poland and me are these two massive land like war empires and Egypt.

697
00:50:24,631 --> 00:50:28,285
Speaker 0: was this lost strip of culture between the two of us?

698
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:32,423
Speaker 1: you know well Black Friday I think would be a fun game to play online.

699
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:34,174
Speaker 1: if it's an online version I could just play.

700
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,584
Speaker 1: you know you could play one in like an hour or whatever.

701
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:40,857
Speaker 1: if a computer did it for you it would be so fast.

702
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,796
Speaker 0: but I feel like playing it physically with people is the only way.

703
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:45,359
Speaker 0: this game right.

704
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:55,624
Speaker 1: but what I'm saying is that and I would really like it even more if someone made a somewhat similar stock market game where there's like a fake market and stocks go up and down.

705
00:50:55,664 --> 00:51:00,098
Speaker 1: yeah except it's more real-time if it's digital right.

706
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,931
Speaker 0: so you're more mule trading right.

707
00:51:02,951 --> 00:51:06,369
Speaker 1: you basically pretend like there's a fake stock market and everyone the gate.

708
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:19,208
Speaker 1: the day you got it you've got dials know your socks buy or sell and there's like anyway bye bye bye bye and basically the stocks are moving in real time and you're basically simulating like a day of day trading or something.

709
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:23,370
Speaker 1: yeah obviously it only takes an hour that the clock is sped up and then you play.

710
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:26,484
Speaker 0: as long as that feedback loop is this game I can't stress enough.

711
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:34,158
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna try to explain the details of the feedback loop of how stock prices get determined in this game.

712
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:35,122
Speaker 0: you just got to read the rules.

713
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:41,732
Speaker 1: cubes move around a grid based on how many cubes come out of a bag minus how many black suitcases come out of a bag.

714
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:44,764
Speaker 0: but it is a fascinating mechanism.

715
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:49,451
Speaker 0: if I ever get the chance to interview Friedman freeze the first question I'm gonna ask how did you come up with this?

716
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:55,157
Speaker 0: yeah how did you play test and design this specific mechanism in Schwartz sir free tags?

717
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:58,731
Speaker 1: I made a lot of games so I'm good at genius game maker.

718
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:06,868
Speaker 1: so yeah I don't know if this game is for everybody but if you like stocks and you like you're okay playing games that are a little bit hard to understand.

719
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:11,431
Speaker 1: well I'd say and you got you like to play for an hour with you know four or five six is it?

720
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:13,520
Speaker 1: go to six people and check.

721
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:19,184
Speaker 0: actually if you're the kind of person then you know but I don't know how you gonna find it.

722
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:24,796
Speaker 0: if you're the kind of person who shows up at the friends houses with the games or you're the one who like runs games for people.

723
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:34,257
Speaker 0: this is a must-buy because you'll know the rules you can do the annoying part and people will really have fun with this game like people who play board games.

724
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:40,484
Speaker 1: I feel like yeah but I think that this might not be a fun game for people who chafe at things that are complicated.

725
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:46,443
Speaker 0: again I might buy it cuz I fit to define I how do you gonna find a cop?

726
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:49,435
Speaker 0: uh I bet I can find a copy all right.

727
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:51,182
Speaker 0: well uh Amazon right now $54.

728
00:52:51,182 --> 00:52:53,793
Speaker 0: that's not the worst it's not great.

729
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:57,949
Speaker 0: I mean I paid for like 80 for la cheetah and I've played that three times in my life.

730
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:02,682
Speaker 1: okay well whatever I'm hungry yeah but this is a good game.

731
00:53:07,668 --> 00:53:09,912
