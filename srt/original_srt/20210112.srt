1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:08,920
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,221
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, January 12th, 2021.

3
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:11,482
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:14,510
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,236
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:20,250
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about Nerds Online.

7
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:22,508
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:34,290
Speaker 0: So, whatever fuckery I was up to over the weekend doesn't really matter, because if you weren't paying attention, we didn't do a show last week toward the end of the week, because there was a literal coup in the United States.

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:40,430
Speaker 1: Well, there have been many things that you could argue were coups.

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,969
Speaker 0: But I think this one was the biggest one to me.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,069
Speaker 1: This is the most clearly visible, right?

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,667
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, sometimes there's a thing where it's like it definitely happened, but it's still like an idea, right?

13
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:01,670
Speaker 0: It never got to the point of like the MAGA chuds literally stormed the Capitol.

14
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:05,486
Speaker 1: This is like a physical object that you cannot deny, right?

15
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:09,870
Speaker 1: The physical, undeniable manifestation of the thing.

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,286
Speaker 1: So you can't just be like, "Oh, words, words,

17
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:12,689
Speaker 1: words.".

18
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:15,690
Speaker 0: There are already truthers saying it didn't happen.

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,509
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there are.

20
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,870
Speaker 1: Those people said the moon landing didn't happen, too.

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,510
Speaker 1: You know, there's always going to be that person.

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,749
Speaker 1: You can't do anything about that.

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,279
Speaker 0: Yeah.

25
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:34,530
Speaker 0: And there are way smarter and more informed people to learn about this from than us, but the reason we bring it up now is that this is not something you can ignore.

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,563
Speaker 0: Like, this is not something you can say, "Oh, I just want to go do something with video games and escape from this,".

27
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:39,866
Speaker 0: because...

28
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,909
Speaker 1: I don't think anybody listening to Geek Nights is ignoring.

29
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:49,366
Speaker 0: If somehow someone's like that and listening to this, like, I don't know what you were listening to for the last 15 years.

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,429
Speaker 0: Also, if you were there... Like when I kicked that gamer gator out of our YouTube channel a while ago.

31
00:01:56,093 --> 00:02:02,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you participated in that event in any way whatsoever, you are banned from all Geek Nights forever.

32
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:02,625
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,530
Speaker 0: You're just like a disgraceful human being.

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,550
Speaker 1: I guess I can't stop you from listening to Geek Nights, but...

35
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,288
Speaker 0: I would if I could.

36
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,008
Speaker 1: I would if I could.

37
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:12,687
Speaker 1: And if I do find out...

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,549
Speaker 0: If you were there, let us know, because we'd really like to call the FBI on you.

39
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,787
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,450
Speaker 1: Unless you, you know, were part, you know, one of the few people on, you know, not participating, but just happening to be there, right?

41
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,408
Speaker 1: There were journalists who were there.

42
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:27,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,348
Speaker 1: Congress people who were there.

44
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,607
Speaker 0: There was that one cop who, like, led the violent mob away from the Senate long enough for them to lock it, like...

45
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:46,250
Speaker 1: I'm, you know, still not 100% sure on that story, but clearly that cop was not, you know, was actually trying to do something and not taking selfies, right?

47
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:46,692
Speaker 1: So...

48
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,120
Speaker 0: Yep.

49
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,090
Speaker 0: I saw a selfie guy got in trouble finally.

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,870
Speaker 1: So the FBI definitely saw a video of at least one cop actually beating up a white person.

51
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,689
Speaker 1: So you're still a bad cop.

52
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,069
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to beat up anybody.

53
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:01,761
Speaker 0: But if they're...

54
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:02,649
Speaker 1: The problem is...

55
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is they beat up people.

56
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:10,850
Speaker 0: they shouldn't beat up, but then the one time there's a literal violent insurrection, they're like, Now we're just gonna hang back, mostly.

57
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:11,625
Speaker 0: We're gonna let this

58
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:11,849
Speaker 0: happen.".

59
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:17,390
Speaker 1: She's not beat up anybody, but you should also not let anyone in the building.

60
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:17,938
Speaker 0: Yep.

61
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:19,230
Speaker 1: You can do both.

62
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:19,948
Speaker 1: That's your job.

63
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:26,370
Speaker 0: But just the thing to bear in mind, and we'll move on to our gaming stuff tonight, is that this wasn't a failed coup attempt.

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,110
Speaker 0: This is an ongoing coup attempt.

65
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,170
Speaker 0: Like, this is not over or resolved.

66
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,708
Speaker 1: It's been ongoing.

67
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,210
Speaker 0: It's been ongoing for about four years, but it's starting to culminate.

68
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,849
Speaker 1: It's sort of like how people are like, you know, Vietnam War was just part of the Cold War, right?

69
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:48,730
Speaker 1: So it's like, the coup is like ongoing, and this was just sort of like a Vietnam War in the larger coup situation.

70
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:49,868
Speaker 0: Yep.

71
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:59,590
Speaker 0: So stay informed, and more importantly, stay safe, because there are very credible threats against literally every state capital in America on Inauguration Day.

72
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,487
Speaker 0: Like, to quote one police officer that we both know, Chief Wiggum, "This is gonna get worse before it gets

73
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:07,750
Speaker 0: better.".

74
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:09,488
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

75
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,170
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what we said before, and it's gotten worse.

76
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:17,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not sure if it's gonna get better yet.

77
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:19,230
Speaker 0: It might get worse once for a while.

78
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:26,330
Speaker 1: Like, in past times, we said this is gonna get worse, and it's gotten worse, and we're saying it's gonna get worse still.

79
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:32,690
Speaker 1: We have not reached yet the point at which we can say the betterness is happening, right?

80
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,670
Speaker 1: It's like we have a COVID vaccine out, for example.

81
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,170
Speaker 1: Another, you know, the two catastrophes we're suffering at once, you know.

82
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,749
Speaker 0: That technology led to a potential likely vaccine for both MS and HIV.

83
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:45,949
Speaker 0: That didn't even make the news.

84
00:04:47,151 --> 00:05:00,729
Speaker 1: No, but the point is that I'm trying to make is that if you go to Google, right, and you look at the COVID numbers, right, even though the vaccine is starting to be distributed to people who, you know, in places, mountain is just the highest it's been.

85
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,301
Speaker 0: Yep.

86
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:13,549
Speaker 1: You look at the little graph, and it's like, you know, the graph says April 4th, right, there's a first mountain, and this first mountain on April 4th, at least for New York, is this New York?

87
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,709
Speaker 1: I don't know when this is, or yeah, I guess it's, yeah, it's New York because that's where I am.

88
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:24,649
Speaker 1: It says, yeah, like 12,000 something cases, and that was when it was horrifying, and there was like nobody was going outside at all.

89
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in New York, you just hear sirens in the distance, and the straights were just...

90
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:31,250
Speaker 1: Yes, and that was when the graph was at 12,000.

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,290
Speaker 1: So that mountain went down to like a really low kind of rumble, right?

92
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,786
Speaker 1: Like it wasn't zero, but it sort of flattened out into like the hundreds, up from down from 12,000 something, right?

93
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:53,412
Speaker 1: You know, May, July, September, and then in November, it started to go up again, and it's now January, and it's not at 12,000, it's at almost 20,000.

94
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:58,847
Speaker 0: Yep, and you can see this very clearly, like the Y is pretty simple, like schools are open, restaurants are open.

95
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,069
Speaker 0: Driving to go like hike in the wilderness, we went out of New York City through New Jersey, and you know what I saw?

96
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:07,590
Speaker 0: All along those roads, packed restaurants.

97
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:17,350
Speaker 1: Well, that's the thing, I'm still staying at home as if it was still, you know, as still the times with the sirens.

98
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:23,330
Speaker 1: It's been siren time since, you know, we got home from PAX East, and it hasn't stopped.

99
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,969
Speaker 1: I'd recommend you do the same.

100
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:36,150
Speaker 0: Don't go anywhere unless you need to, and particularly don't go into other buildings, don't go to a restaurant, don't visit your family, like what the hell?

101
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:49,129
Speaker 1: Even if I get two vaccines, and then time passes, and I'm fine and such, I'm not going outside until this big mountain graph goes way down, lower than the low rumble of the summer, like, you know, it's got to go down down.

102
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,248
Speaker 1: It's got to look like the measles graph, right?

103
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,350
Speaker 0: Yep, it's going to be tough though, because the vaccine is not rolling out very quickly for a lot of reasons in America.

104
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,870
Speaker 1: No, but I'm saying, it's like you think about it, like I have a measles vaccine, there are still people out there with measles though, it's not eliminated, right?

105
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:19,150
Speaker 1: But I still go outside without worrying about measles, so I need to reach that sort of level where like, I have a COVID vaccine, but the number of COVID cases out there is, you know, around the number of like measles cases, right?

106
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:27,709
Speaker 1: And I'm not, even though there's people out there who have it, I'm not going to be, I can go outside without worrying about getting it, and then I'll go outside again.

107
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:33,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the real trouble is going to be just how many people are going to refuse that vaccine and how we deal with that situation.

108
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,669
Speaker 1: Then they're not allowed to do anything.

109
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:45,509
Speaker 1: You can say you can't go to, you can't come to an office to work, you have to work from home or not work, you have to, you can't come into a place, you know, just like you're just banned from places.

110
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,389
Speaker 1: You can't go, nope, can't come to this football game, nope, can't come in.

111
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's the reasonable and prudent thing to do, but that's not what's Concert, nope, can't go.

112
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,129
Speaker 0: You know how America rolls, America will never do something like that.

113
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,710
Speaker 1: Can't come past the velvet rope, not allowed.

114
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:09,829
Speaker 0: I sadly think what's actually going to happen is all the people who refuse that vaccine are going to slowly just get COVID long after everyone else is vaccinated because they'll refuse and no laws will be passed to force them.

115
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:11,768
Speaker 1: We'll see.

116
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:13,982
Speaker 1: All right.

117
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:17,589
Speaker 0: And speaking of things that are going to get worse before they get better.

118
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:30,890
Speaker 0: So Twitch, if you're not familiar with the culture of Twitch, there's this little box where people can type words and it's just a shitstorm of chaos on popular Twitch streams.

119
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, really it is like different levels, right?

120
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:45,549
Speaker 1: So it's like it's the same stupid box, but if you're on a really unpopular stream, right, like nobody's there, you can have like this one on one conversation with the person streaming if they're paying attention to the box.

121
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:47,710
Speaker 1: And sometimes that's a really good thing.

122
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,109
Speaker 1: And sometimes it's a really bad thing.

123
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:54,230
Speaker 1: If there's a few people in there, you can actually get like a little community going.

124
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you add that few actually goes up to like, you know, hundreds, right?

125
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:09,490
Speaker 1: You can have hundreds of people in there and actually, you know, like depending on what game it is and what the kind of people are in that chat, right?

126
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,830
Speaker 1: Like, you know, if they're playing, you know, cyberpunk, whatever, a few hundred people in the chat is probably not going to go anywhere.

127
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,127
Speaker 1: Great.

128
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,950
Speaker 1: Just based on the kind of community of people who are into that game.

129
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:29,590
Speaker 1: But if you were to watch, you know, someone doing Mario speedruns, right, it's like the chat is going to be, you know, better probably than the cyberpunk one.

130
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:40,428
Speaker 0: But the thing that will happen, the thing that will usually happen is people will say words and other people will read those specific words above a certain point, which is very different.

131
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:41,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

132
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:53,409
Speaker 1: If you get up to the thousands of people in the chat, the big ones, or depending on what it is that's being watched right on the stream, it's just this flood of emojis and random words that no one can read.

133
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:57,410
Speaker 1: And you can type something and it will contribute to the flood of emojis and random words.

134
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,409
Speaker 1: And I don't even know what the purpose of it is at that point.

135
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like this weird background.

136
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,790
Speaker 1: It's not it's not conversation.

137
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,650
Speaker 1: It's more like the cheering at a concert.

138
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,390
Speaker 1: You just hear, ah, right.

139
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,790
Speaker 1: It's not a it's not talking.

140
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:23,790
Speaker 0: I do think in the long run, like there will be a future where people will look like older, like we will there be a time in Geek Night's future where we'll look back and talk about like, yeah, I remember that weird era when people would like type into that box on Twitch.

141
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,430
Speaker 1: Well, it's like if you go to a if you're at a baseball game, right.

142
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,430
Speaker 1: You know, you yell at the players.

143
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, you bum.

144
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,434
Speaker 1: And that's the.

145
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,439
Speaker 1: what is the if you're?

146
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,470
Speaker 1: imagine if you're a player in a baseball, a major league baseball game and it's the stadium is full.

147
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:37,170
Speaker 1: Right.

148
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,609
Speaker 1: What do you hear on the field?

149
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,550
Speaker 1: You might hear you might hear some individual words poking out here and there.

150
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:46,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

151
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,003
Speaker 1: That's what the Twitch chat becomes when it's a lot of people.

152
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:58,169
Speaker 1: is that sort of stadium noise and you're either one voice in the crowd of noise or you're the streamer hearing the noise.

153
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:13,989
Speaker 0: So in that context, many of you older people might not be familiar with the concept of poggers or the pogchamp, which was one of the default emoji because Twitch has got the whole thing with emojis like Discord does.

154
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,446
Speaker 0: But one of the emojis happened to just be this dude who's a super piece of shit, by the way.

155
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,144
Speaker 0: We'll get back to that.

156
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,710
Speaker 0: Ryan Gutek saw Gutierrez.

157
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:30,944
Speaker 1: And this basically, you know, I don't know if people know the history of Twitch, but there was a site just in TV around the mid 2000s, early 2000 ish era.

158
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:33,070
Speaker 1: Right.

159
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,349
Speaker 1: When Geek Night started around that.

160
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did a live stream way back.

161
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:40,670
Speaker 1: This dude, Justin, was just like streaming himself.

162
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:41,450
Speaker 1: Right.

163
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:44,249
Speaker 1: And he made a website just in TV.

164
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:58,990
Speaker 1: And then eventually they sort of, you know, when Justin TV became like a thing, they said, hey, let's like take our exact same website and put it on a run the same technology to let people live stream on another domain, Twitch TV.

165
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:04,989
Speaker 1: And it'll be basically the same kind of thing that you have, you know, because Justin TV was focused on streaming yourself.

166
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:05,309
Speaker 1: Right.

167
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,849
Speaker 1: Which was hard to do in that time.

168
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:19,347
Speaker 1: I remember what we had, like the ridiculous shit we set up to do our like live stream, which, yeah, we did it on Ustream, which is a site they think is dead now or might still be alive, but no one's using it anyway.

169
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,850
Speaker 0: We had those halogen like lights on the floor.

170
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,430
Speaker 0: I was worried they're going to set the carpet on fire.

171
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

172
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,909
Speaker 1: Twitch was basically just like, hey, it's the Justin TV technology stack only gaming focused.

173
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:36,508
Speaker 1: And those original emojis sort of come from those early times in the mid late 2000s.

174
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:47,290
Speaker 1: Like Greek legends at this point, like most people don't really know culture that were involved in that community at that time were then used to make those emojis.

175
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,390
Speaker 1: As sort of like the inside jokes of that original community.

176
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:58,130
Speaker 1: And then because all of the communities that came in to basically displace the original, the original Twitch community is basically dead, right?

177
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,590
Speaker 1: It's gone.

178
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:11,546
Speaker 1: It got displaced by many, many, many other communities that collectively make up the Twitch community, but they inherited those, you know, images as sort of like relics, like archeologists digging up these emojis, right?

179
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:14,110
Speaker 1: And giving them new meaning, right?

180
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:19,088
Speaker 1: Because they, the people who signed a Twitch, they don't know anything about that original community, right?

181
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,230
Speaker 1: All they see are those emojis and they know what PogChamp, they see that face.

182
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:28,126
Speaker 1: They know it's called PogChamp and they learn from other people how to use it and what it means.

183
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:32,150
Speaker 0: And the way it works, you know, we go back to the sports stadium analogy.

184
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,170
Speaker 0: Now you're in an arena and it's just like the roar of the crowd.

185
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,690
Speaker 0: But every now and then, like, let's go, right?

186
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,770
Speaker 0: Like whatever team it is, like a chant will start.

187
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:43,710
Speaker 0: And that cuts above the noise a little bit.

188
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,429
Speaker 0: And there's this moment where like you can, everyone can hear this.

189
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:48,489
Speaker 0: That's kind of what these emojis do.

190
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:49,690
Speaker 0: Like the pogs will appear.

191
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,530
Speaker 1: If you see the same emojis, like you'll see the same emoji just flooding the chat, right?

192
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,950
Speaker 1: Like it's a pile of the same one, right?

193
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,017
Speaker 1: Yup.

194
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,830
Speaker 1: That's a, that's like the one doing the wave, right?

195
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:02,530
Speaker 0: So the PogChamp emoji basically has been that for a while.

196
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:09,445
Speaker 1: And the meaning of the PogChamp emoji is basically like, you know, it's like this guy with like his lips out, like, whoa.

197
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,550
Speaker 0: Like it does not mean I support Brian Gutex, the street fighter player from ancient times.

198
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,490
Speaker 1: It just, it's like, it's his face, right?

199
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,389
Speaker 1: With his lips out.

200
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:22,730
Speaker 1: Like he's surprised or amazed at something like way awesome.

201
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:23,196
Speaker 1: Like, whoa.

202
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:28,010
Speaker 1: So like, you know, if someone does something awesome, you'd be like, whoa, PogChamp.

203
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:28,745
Speaker 1: Right.

204
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,248
Speaker 1: That's the meaning of it.

205
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:41,250
Speaker 1: So it turns out if you're watching a streamer and they like beat a boss in an amazing way or something, you would, you would hammer like 10 PogChamp emojis and press enter.

206
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:55,430
Speaker 0: So basically when the insurrectionists Republicans stormed the Capitol, Gutex said some things encouraging to the rioters and basically called for more violence.

207
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:56,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,770
Speaker 1: So he was already a known piece of shit person, right?

209
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,447
Speaker 1: This wasn't new.

210
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,710
Speaker 1: He has gone down the hole.

211
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,390
Speaker 1: It was not a secret amongst people, right?

212
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,090
Speaker 1: That he was not a good individual, but you know, as with many things, right?

213
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:14,670
Speaker 1: There are certain people who tolerate too much intolerance.

214
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:20,290
Speaker 1: And you know, this the latest physical coup, right?

215
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,130
Speaker 1: Was a camel straw for many of those people.

216
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:32,569
Speaker 1: And so, you know, many companies, you know, capitalist, uh, corporations that, you know, run the world and have more power than they should.

217
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,910
Speaker 1: But we're lucky in this case that they have, well, lucky and unlucky, right?

218
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,810
Speaker 1: The fact that they have so much power has allowed those people to carry on for so long.

219
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:47,430
Speaker 1: But the fact that they have the power has allowed them to finally silence those people.

220
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:47,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

221
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,787
Speaker 1: Or de-platform, right?

222
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,490
Speaker 0: So at first Twitch was like, we're removing the PogChamp emote and that was fine.

223
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:56,350
Speaker 0: But they actually had a cool idea.

224
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,970
Speaker 0: But this is where I get back into, it's going to get worse before it gets better.

225
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,630
Speaker 0: And like, they were trying to figure out, like, do we just, we want to have an emote that does that same function.

226
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,529
Speaker 0: Let's control our platform a little bit.

227
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,790
Speaker 0: Some people talked about making the PogChamp just be a different face or a different thing.

228
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:14,930
Speaker 1: But how could we choose, like, just, you know, a new thing to replace, right?

229
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,310
Speaker 1: It's like, it would have to be perfect, right?

230
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:22,969
Speaker 1: And how could you on short notice come up with like, you know, this perfect replacement for a thing?

231
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,850
Speaker 0: Twitch wouldn't be able to figure that out on their own.

232
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,490
Speaker 0: You can't be like, hello, children.

233
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,750
Speaker 0: This is the new thing to be hype about.

234
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,170
Speaker 1: Whatever you choose to be so forced and unorganic.

235
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,668
Speaker 0: Unless it had just been poochy.

236
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,930
Speaker 0: I think that might've been perfect.

237
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:46,010
Speaker 1: The only way, I think maybe the only time in recent memory that I've seen someone try to force a thing and have it work is Gritty the mascot.

238
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:47,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,069
Speaker 0: Gritty that went from, there was like a four hour window when the whole world said, what the fuck is that?

240
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:52,869
Speaker 0: That is terrible.

241
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,603
Speaker 0: And that immediately turned into, this is the most important thing in the history of hockey.

242
00:16:58,612 --> 00:16:59,549
Speaker 1: They tried to force it.

243
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,650
Speaker 0: Nay, the city of Philadelphia.

244
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,694
Speaker 1: You know, they tried to force it and then somehow the people adopted it and repaired it.

245
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:16,290
Speaker 1: But I don't, to do that on purpose, right, is so, such a difficult, creative task, right?

246
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,489
Speaker 1: Like, you know, Van Gogh can't do that.

247
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,029
Speaker 1: Even if you get the Michelangelo can't do it.

248
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:22,169
Speaker 1: It's so hard.

249
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,750
Speaker 1: So they came up with a clever idea from a certain point of view.

250
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,677
Speaker 0: Sean Plot tweeted at them and said, this is like, Twitch is like, this is what caused it.

251
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:40,350
Speaker 0: Yo Twitch, suggestion for pogchamp, create a database of streamer faces, whatever someone types pogchamp, display one of those at random.

252
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,249
Speaker 1: Like that is a good idea.

253
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:44,168
Speaker 1: It is a good idea.

254
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:45,588
Speaker 0: And Twitch was like, you know what?

255
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:46,465
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

256
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,047
Speaker 0: Yeah.

257
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:50,430
Speaker 0: Now, of course, Twitch knows that gamers exist.

258
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:55,489
Speaker 0: So they were, they couldn't just make it like random people's faces without their consent or anything like that.

259
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,970
Speaker 1: It has to be people who have put themselves, you know, up for this, right?

260
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,010
Speaker 1: You need to, right?

261
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,449
Speaker 1: Even they even had like a lawsuit with the original guy.

262
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,649
Speaker 1: They had to give him some money because they're like, hey, you're using my likeness, you know, whatever.

263
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,529
Speaker 1: So what they did is they said, hey, here's what we're going to do.

264
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:12,909
Speaker 1: We're going to have one.

265
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,690
Speaker 1: We're going to have like pogchamp of the day.

266
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:22,330
Speaker 1: Every day we'll find someone who agrees to it and we'll get their face and we'll make so rim will be pogchamp today.

267
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,670
Speaker 1: And every time someone does pogchamp today, they'll see rim's face.

268
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,170
Speaker 1: And then for 24 hours, it'll be rim's face.

269
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,670
Speaker 1: And at the end of the 24 hours, it'll suddenly switch to someone else's face.

270
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:34,410
Speaker 1: So we can highlight individual people, right?

271
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,370
Speaker 1: If it's all random, you don't really get that sort of promotional aspect, right?

272
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,749
Speaker 1: It's just sort of like, uh, you know, what's it going to be?

273
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,670
Speaker 1: Who is that person?

274
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:43,588
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is.

275
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,050
Speaker 1: Right.

276
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:49,650
Speaker 1: But by making it one person a day, it becomes more like the Google Doodle, which is a very good thing, actually.

277
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,849
Speaker 1: Maybe the best thing Google does.

278
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not evil in any way.

279
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:56,130
Speaker 1: It's not evil in any way, right?

280
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,190
Speaker 1: It's a lot like the Google Doodle.

281
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,370
Speaker 1: Who's pogchamp today?

282
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,770
Speaker 1: Let's learn about this streamer.

283
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,990
Speaker 1: We want to highlight and promote our, you know, our people that make our platform money, right?

284
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:14,586
Speaker 1: Today, we're going to highlight, you know, Andy, the Lord of the Rings player, or we'll highlight, you know, Abco the DJ, you know, pick someone different every day who wants to do it.

285
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,490
Speaker 0: Now, even better, Twitch was like, you know what?

286
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,850
Speaker 0: For the first one, they didn't just pick a white dude.

287
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, you couldn't pick a white dude.

288
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,067
Speaker 1: Not in 2020, right?

289
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,330
Speaker 1: It's like, you can have a white dude on there eventually, but if you start with a white dude, that's like common sense.

290
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,828
Speaker 0: That is like, read the room.

291
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,290
Speaker 1: And it's like, you cannot do a white dude on like, you know, like month two, you can start doing a white dude, right?

292
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:38,008
Speaker 1: It's like, come on.

293
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,443
Speaker 0: Yep.

294
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,490
Speaker 0: So they picked Critical Bard.

295
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:41,388
Speaker 0: Awesome dude.

296
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,570
Speaker 0: Like stand up individual.

297
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,810
Speaker 0: Like, I got nothing bad to say about Critical Bard.

298
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:47,730
Speaker 1: I like me a Critical Bard.

299
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:54,390
Speaker 1: You know, I could, if I was ranking, you know, Twitch people, Critical Bard would be relatively highly ranked.

300
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,230
Speaker 0: Cause I mean, I'd like, I watch streams after the fact on YouTube.

301
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,810
Speaker 0: I basically never, ever watch Twitch.

302
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,370
Speaker 0: Like, to be honest, like ever.

303
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:03,990
Speaker 1: You don't have to.

304
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just don't.

305
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,050
Speaker 0: Like, I don't really follow any streamers except via like topics.

306
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,950
Speaker 0: But anyway, so Critical Bard, cool.

307
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,829
Speaker 0: Like, this is awesome.

308
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,707
Speaker 0: People are into it.

309
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,528
Speaker 1: Critical Bard was down with it.

310
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:15,590
Speaker 0: Like they got the photo, right?

311
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,190
Speaker 0: Like the icon looked perfect.

312
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,969
Speaker 0: Like they, they even captured like the poggishness of the poggers.

313
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,410
Speaker 0: The problem was, uh, Critical Bard is black and that is not a problem.

314
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,790
Speaker 0: Yes, it is still Twitch.

315
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,990
Speaker 0: These are still gamers.

316
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:39,410
Speaker 0: The torrent of racist bullshit that came his way was legendary in how awful it was.

317
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,209
Speaker 0: Like, holy shit, did this get bad fast.

318
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,590
Speaker 0: Oh, gamers are going to get super racist on Twitch.

319
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:46,930
Speaker 0: Oh, Lord.

320
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:47,490
Speaker 0: Yeah.

321
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:48,850
Speaker 1: Who could have seen this coming?

322
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:49,870
Speaker 1: I could have seen this coming.

323
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,709
Speaker 1: I saw this coming.

324
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,690
Speaker 1: I knew this was coming.

325
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:55,010
Speaker 1: Now, Captain Obvious knew this was coming.

326
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,109
Speaker 0: Now, Twitch.

327
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,328
Speaker 1: So did Captain Hindsight.

328
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,409
Speaker 1: They did a tag team.

329
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:05,389
Speaker 0: Someone in Twitch had to have seen this coming, but why didn't Twitch like plan to do something about this?

330
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,350
Speaker 1: Like, all you had to do was get like a moderator into the Critical Bard's channel.

331
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:10,750
Speaker 1: Be like, okay, listen, Critical Bard.

332
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:17,410
Speaker 1: We know you're going to get harassed to hell today because now all these pieces of shit here is our team suddenly know who you are, who didn't know who you were before.

333
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,590
Speaker 0: It's just like you become president.

334
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:19,690
Speaker 0: You get the secret service.

335
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,590
Speaker 0: You become PogChamp.

336
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,930
Speaker 0: You get the Twitch service.

337
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,530
Speaker 0: Like, they're going to, they got your back.

338
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,410
Speaker 1: All these people who didn't know who you were yesterday know who you are today.

339
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,930
Speaker 1: They know your face and they're coming.

340
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,950
Speaker 0: And about 40% of them are super racist.

341
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,170
Speaker 1: Yes, some of them are good people and are going to grow your audience, but some of them are super racist.

342
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,630
Speaker 1: Let's put an army of moderators on you for a little while to ban all those people from.

343
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:43,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, more importantly, that is the thing.

344
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:50,409
Speaker 0: Twitch had to, like, they should have been ready to actually ban the people who reacted to this poorly.

345
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,950
Speaker 0: That would not be hard.

346
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,380
Speaker 0: Twitch really walked too thin of a line by not, by trying to not, like, be aggressive with their ban hammers.

347
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,230
Speaker 0: in this situation.

348
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:13,910
Speaker 1: Like, you need to aggressively pursue racist behavior on your platforms as hard as possible, especially could have actually, you know, you know, with Critical Bard's permission, this could have been a good honeypot.

349
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,670
Speaker 0: I was about to say a sting operation.

350
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:23,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could have been, you know, like, you know, as long as, you know, the Critical Bard was willing to be the bait.

351
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,770
Speaker 1: You don't want to, you know, victimize someone for the sake of this killing, right?

352
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,469
Speaker 1: That's way wrong.

353
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,810
Speaker 1: But it could have been played like that, like, ha ha ha.

354
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,830
Speaker 1: Now we can find out how the bad people are and ban them.

355
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,710
Speaker 1: But no, they didn't really do that, did they?

356
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:35,042
Speaker 1: Nope.

357
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:47,090
Speaker 0: Now, Critical Bard took it all in pretty good stride and said, like, you can, I'll link to the thread where he talks about it, but his official statement, like, kind of as this started to wind down was, with one hour left, this is all I can say.

358
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:57,649
Speaker 0: I hope future Pogchamps are not just prepared for kickback, but for the ways these folks will twist anything you say to make you look like a villain in their privileged story, especially if you are marginalized.

359
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:58,910
Speaker 0: Just be careful.

360
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,910
Speaker 0: The idea of a rotating community Pogchamp was an amazing idea.

361
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,990
Speaker 0: And when I was asked, I hopped out immediately because I knew what it could mean.

362
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,669
Speaker 0: I expected racism.

363
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,590
Speaker 0: I didn't expect the chaos that followed.

364
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,490
Speaker 0: But know that your day will be hard and you're a Pogchamp for a reason.

365
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:17,247
Speaker 1: That's true.

366
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:20,649
Speaker 0: So follow this space.

367
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:31,790
Speaker 0: But seriously, if you use Twitch, like, report people who say racist shit if you see them and pressure Twitch to take more aggressive action in these instances.

368
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,309
Speaker 0: They have the power to do it.

369
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:34,326
Speaker 0: We know they do.

370
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:37,029
Speaker 0: Every day that they don't, they're choosing not to.

371
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:43,410
Speaker 1: Think of it sort of like, you know, like we said, the noise of Twitch chat is like the crowd at the stadium, right?

372
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,430
Speaker 1: So when it's safe to go to stadiums again, right, you got to think of it the same way.

373
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:58,729
Speaker 1: If some racist guy is yelling in the next section over, right, racial slurs at the not white player on one of the teams, you got to text the security at the stadium so they come and kick that guy's ass out.

374
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,769
Speaker 0: Yep, they'll show up.

375
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,307
Speaker 0: They'll do it.

376
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:01,669
Speaker 0: Twitch needs to do the same.

377
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:05,150
Speaker 0: You need to lean on Twitch to do this kind of thing, right?

378
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,650
Speaker 1: But they, you know, the security is watching with the cameras, but they can't hear everyone at the stadium.

379
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,421
Speaker 1: It's too much, right?

380
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,630
Speaker 1: You know, you got to help out a little bit, even if there's mods in there.

381
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,368
Speaker 1: You can't see there's a flood, right?

382
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:22,436
Speaker 0: So in some other news, there's going to be a new Indiana Jones game like Bethesda announced this.

383
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,820
Speaker 0: We don't know anything like.

384
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,190
Speaker 0: we know almost nothing about it, except it's going to be a completely original title.

385
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:35,649
Speaker 1: Yes, Indiana Jones games have a long history in the tabletop RPG and the point and click adventure space.

386
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,410
Speaker 1: And then there's semi Indiana Jones games like Pitfall, which is that's Indiana Jones.

387
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,210
Speaker 1: Come on, right?

388
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,514
Speaker 1: Nobody's.

389
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:43,277
Speaker 0: there's that.

390
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:44,543
Speaker 0: there's that arcade games.

391
00:24:44,624 --> 00:24:46,030
Speaker 0: that is not actually good.

392
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,329
Speaker 0: Do not try to pretend otherwise.

393
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:50,770
Speaker 1: Super Pitfall is not Indiana Jones, only regular Pitfall.

394
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,489
Speaker 0: Well, Super Pitfall is a travesty.

395
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:58,129
Speaker 1: And then you've got ones like Spelunky, which are a little bit Indiana Jones, right?

396
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:06,170
Speaker 1: Anyway, these games have you know, it's not like other intellectual properties where the games are sort of all hit or all miss.

397
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,330
Speaker 1: It's a really mixed bag of all sorts of different stuff, right?

398
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,347
Speaker 1: You know, ranging from like LucasArts stuff to I mean, Star Wars games.

399
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:18,230
Speaker 0: in the same way, like take all the Star Wars games that have been made and they are all over the place.

400
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,950
Speaker 1: There's a lot more Star Wars games than Indiana Jones games.

401
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,441
Speaker 0: There are.

402
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:25,510
Speaker 1: There's also the Diana Jones Award, which is infamous.

403
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:37,570
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this new game we know made by Bethesda is coming from the people who have made the recent quite good Wolfenstein games.

404
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,310
Speaker 1: And what does that have in common with Indiana Jones games?

405
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,488
Speaker 1: They're Nazi killing games.

406
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,529
Speaker 1: These are the Nazi killing video game experts.

407
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,629
Speaker 0: Also, the fact that it's not just oh, the Nazis are killed in these games and the Nazis are the enemy.

408
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:57,170
Speaker 0: Their social media and the statements they make in public about their games are very clear about whether or not they are pro or anti-Nazi.

409
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:02,869
Speaker 1: I just feel really interesting that it's like, all right, we need someone to make an Indiana Jones game.

410
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:06,170
Speaker 1: Let's pick the people who make the shoot Nazi game.

411
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:13,550
Speaker 0: I mean, the best Indiana Jones, the best part about Indiana Jones is that he's fighting Nazis, right?

412
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,290
Speaker 1: It's like they could have picked, you know, any other game studio they wanted.

413
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:19,310
Speaker 0: Those two movies are fantastic.

414
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,009
Speaker 1: All two of them.

415
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,753
Speaker 0: All 2.1.

416
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:27,065
Speaker 0: There's like one scene in the second one.

417
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:27,529
Speaker 0: that's okay.

418
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:39,048
Speaker 0: But so the other thing that's interesting about this, but I don't think younger people will even notice because younger people like you, LucasArts doesn't mean anything to young people, I don't think.

419
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,327
Speaker 0: But LucasArts meant a lot to me.

420
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:47,170
Speaker 0: They're not releasing this under like the LucasArts label.

421
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,428
Speaker 0: The title is being made under a something called Lucasfilm Games, which was announced yesterday.

422
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:02,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what they've done is they've sort of revived, you know, thanks to, you know, who owns what these days, Disney owning everything, basically.

423
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:04,629
Speaker 1: They have decided to revive.

424
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,310
Speaker 1: They haven't made a new studio.

425
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,167
Speaker 1: LucasArts was a studio, right?

426
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,710
Speaker 1: You know, that made a lot of stuff.

427
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:12,270
Speaker 0: Very important studio.

428
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,490
Speaker 0: Like go watch the someone's got to have made a documentary on it.

429
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,145
Speaker 0: Just go watch that.

430
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:23,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, they made a lot of legendary softwares and other artistic works, but they were dissolved at some point.

431
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,610
Speaker 1: I remember when they were dissolved, it was a big deal in the news.

432
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,029
Speaker 1: Everyone was like, no, I know.

433
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:41,450
Speaker 1: So they're reviving this brand and they're applying this brand to, I assume, video games that are with Lucas-ish properties.

434
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we might see this.

435
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:46,710
Speaker 0: Lucasfilm Games sounds a lot like AOL Time Warner.

436
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:53,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's a lot of movies you go see and they always say, you know, Lucasfilm Limited at the start of the movie.

437
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:07,890
Speaker 1: And basically, if we see from now on, if you see any Lucasfilm intellectual property appear in a video game, you're probably going to see, you know, Lucasfilm Games at the start of the game as one of the brands that appears.

438
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:09,609
Speaker 1: There's no studio behind it.

439
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,850
Speaker 1: It's just they own the intellectual property and they want to slap that label on there.

440
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,810
Speaker 1: If someone comes out with like, I don't know, a fucking Willow.

441
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,170
Speaker 1: Willow's Lucasfilm, right?

442
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,270
Speaker 1: Like they make a Willow game.

443
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,070
Speaker 0: Oh, man, the NES game Willow was underrated.

444
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:23,690
Speaker 0: It's not good, but it was underrated.

445
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,469
Speaker 1: If they make another Willow game, it'll say Lucasfilm.

446
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:30,510
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was right.

447
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,690
Speaker 1: Lucasfilm Limited, Willow.

448
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm right.

449
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:37,227
Speaker 0: So even if like this game might not, depending on what this game actually is, it might not be our jam.

450
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,970
Speaker 0: Like we don't like every game, but American Graffiti, the game is going to say Lucas.

451
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:45,070
Speaker 0: I am excited about this.

452
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,306
Speaker 0: Like what will come out of these efforts?

453
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:49,326
Speaker 1: We'll see.

454
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:59,150
Speaker 0: So in other news about news that made the news again, everyone's talking about Super Mario 3D World plus Bowser's Fury.

455
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:07,645
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean, this was announced quite a while ago, but basically what if you haven't realized Nintendo knows nobody bought a fucking Wii U. Yeah, they know.

456
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,184
Speaker 1: Right.

457
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:15,583
Speaker 1: And, you know, Nintendo, in terms of rereleasing their old games, has always been I guess they've always done it.

458
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:21,209
Speaker 1: But and they but they've done it slower than some people would like and faster than some people need.

459
00:29:21,317 --> 00:29:21,450
Speaker 1: Right.

460
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,690
Speaker 1: So someone like me, I'm always like, why they keep rereleasing this shit.

461
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:25,650
Speaker 1: I own all these games.

462
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,109
Speaker 1: I don't need some fucking Mario Galaxy.

463
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,188
Speaker 1: I have Mario Galaxy.

464
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,769
Speaker 1: And so does a lot of people because we sold a bunch.

465
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,330
Speaker 1: So they didn't bother rereleasing Mario Galaxy on the Wii U because everyone had a Wii.

466
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:39,248
Speaker 1: It was too soon.

467
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:47,290
Speaker 1: But when it gets to two, three, four consoles out, it's like, OK, the children today have never played Ocarina of Time.

468
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:50,369
Speaker 0: I mean, the Wii was a long time ago.

469
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:52,869
Speaker 1: The N64 was a long time ago.

470
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,770
Speaker 1: You know, let us rerelease Ocarina of Time for the new children.

471
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:59,167
Speaker 0: I mean, I I'm reminded of a situation.

472
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:06,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got a situation where even though the Wii U was only the previous console, nobody fucking bought one.

473
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:16,885
Speaker 1: So all the Nintendo exclusive first party games that were on the Wii U get and switch rereleases and Bowser's Fury slash Mario 3D World Land, whatever.

474
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,847
Speaker 1: it was announced a while ago.

475
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,540
Speaker 1: But the trailer hit today and I guess people are having fun with it.

476
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,050
Speaker 0: Yep.

477
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,590
Speaker 0: So the trailer is what caused that discussion.

478
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:27,749
Speaker 0: And you know what?

479
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,809
Speaker 0: I'm really looking forward to this.

480
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:33,250
Speaker 1: I'll play it because I was planning to buy it and play it because obviously I didn't play the original.

481
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never had a. You know what?

482
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:36,870
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever seen a Wii U in person.

483
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:40,089
Speaker 1: I've seen a Wii U in person and I touched a Wii U.

484
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,989
Speaker 0: Well, I think I saw one at like a PAX.

485
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,050
Speaker 0: I've never touched one, though, not once in my entire life.

486
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,205
Speaker 1: It's basically a big bad, a big switch.

487
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:48,829
Speaker 1: that's not good.

488
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, the switch.

489
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:56,630
Speaker 0: I feel like the switch was still like such a groundbreaking piece of hardware.

490
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:01,070
Speaker 0: That the best you can say about the Wii U is that it was the prototype for the switch.

491
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,020
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

492
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,699
Speaker 0: What do you got?

493
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:09,500
Speaker 1: What do I have?

494
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,584
Speaker 1: So, you know, we love.

495
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:16,660
Speaker 1: well, we don't necessarily love the Soviet Union itself as much as we might love democratic socialism.

496
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:19,620
Speaker 1: There was no democratic parts of the Soviet Union.

497
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,180
Speaker 1: That is just the communism with, you know, anyway.

498
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:29,160
Speaker 1: But we do love the artworks of the Soviet Union, right?

499
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:39,160
Speaker 1: And at least the, well, not the message, the aesthetic of their propaganda, architecture, et cetera, because it just looks cool, right?

500
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,798
Speaker 1: You know, it just looks cool.

501
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,320
Speaker 1: And on geek nights, we have featured many times the bus stops of the Soviet Union.

502
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:47,118
Speaker 0: That was the one I was thinking of.

503
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, posters of the Soviet, you know, all sorts of different Soviet artworks.

504
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:56,013
Speaker 1: But of course, you know, a video games of the Soviet Union.

505
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,480
Speaker 1: we featured for sure, right?

506
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:11,780
Speaker 1: So here we have animation of the Soviet Union, obvious, but this is amazing Twitter account that has come and made, you know, occasionally I would see a Soviet animation here or there, and it might get thing of the day or not.

507
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:28,200
Speaker 1: In this case, we have a Twitter account, Soviet animation out of context, that is basically taking clips with subtitles when necessary of many, many, many wide variety of Soviet animation and putting those clips on Twitter frequently.

508
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,440
Speaker 1: Like I'm getting like one more than one a day.

509
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:31,838
Speaker 1: It's like there's a lot to see.

510
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:33,759
Speaker 1: I don't know where they're getting it all from.

511
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,497
Speaker 1: Someone must speak Russian because they're subtitling all of it.

512
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:53,058
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is like the only source you need for a Soviet animation in the English speaking world, unless you want to watch one of these things in full, which I don't think is necessary because I'm here for the aesthetic and none of these things look like they're something I want to watch.

513
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:58,559
Speaker 0: I want to see what's up with this one of the polyphemus because it has some key close energy.

514
00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:01,679
Speaker 1: I think it all has key close energy.

515
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:07,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, cat concert from 1986.

516
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:13,140
Speaker 1: If you appreciate animation and Soviet aesthetic, this is the Twitter account for you to follow.

517
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:14,038
Speaker 1: It is my thing of the day.

518
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,277
Speaker 0: All right.

519
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,508
Speaker 0: So we've been playing, as if you listen to Geek Nights Tuesdays, a lot of train games lately, 18xx games.

520
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,099
Speaker 0: We have like between one and three going at any given time on 18xxgames.net.

521
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:30,540
Speaker 0: It's weird that as of right now, I have zero active train games.

522
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,169
Speaker 0: A long 1817 just ended.

523
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,120
Speaker 0: I didn't win, of course.

524
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,399
Speaker 0: Scott was in last place.

525
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,920
Speaker 0: I was not far ahead of him.

526
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,058
Speaker 1: Well, I got blocked on the first OR.

527
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, whose fault was that?

528
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:41,779
Speaker 1: My fault.

529
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,899
Speaker 1: I didn't see what was coming.

530
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:49,056
Speaker 0: I was doing fine until Evil Forces conspired to short my companies into oblivion at the end of the game.

531
00:33:50,640 --> 00:34:14,534
Speaker 0: But the thing about 18xx games is that while they have a lot of proper nouns around trains from those eras and often one or two financial components that arguably reflect the kinds of things that happened in stock markets in those eras, they don't really map that well to the real history of trains in the world.

532
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:22,179
Speaker 0: They're not that accurate if you zoom in to any degree except on very specific parts of these games.

533
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:31,039
Speaker 0: So what I just watched recently is a whole bunch of documentaries on the train companies that we keep seeing in these games.

534
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,378
Speaker 0: And I was trying to decide if I wanted to... So there are two videos we can look at that I was just trying to decide for my thing of the day.

535
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,500
Speaker 0: One is the New York Central, the NYC, the history of that railway.

536
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,540
Speaker 0: The other one is a video that's just called the Pennsylvania Railroad.

537
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:48,342
Speaker 0: Why?

538
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,620
Speaker 0: Because the PRR was a case study and failure.

539
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:57,600
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day are these two documentaries.

540
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:10,819
Speaker 0: So if you ever played an 18xx game and you wanted to know the story of that token that you picked when you IPO'd your company because that was the coolest looking one, you're about to learn a lot of really boring stuff about trains.

541
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:14,680
Speaker 0: And it's just free on YouTube.

542
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's legal or not, but who cares?

543
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,560
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a big market for the... There's not like this big black piracy market for train documentaries.

544
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:27,998
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, we're still stuck at home.

545
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,760
Speaker 0: I can't go anywhere.

546
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:33,539
Speaker 0: I don't have anything like new.

547
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,540
Speaker 0: I haven't started continuing to read the tale of Hanzo yet.

548
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:42,400
Speaker 1: No, I got a P-Cross game came out and no one told me about it, but I found it.

549
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,660
Speaker 1: And now I'm playing P-Cross.

550
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:45,560
Speaker 0: Oh, that's trouble.

551
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,619
Speaker 1: That's, yeah.

552
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,277
Speaker 0: Oh, someone in the stream was saying, oh, we should get an 18xx.

553
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,540
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll get an 18xx game with some listener.

554
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:52,360
Speaker 0: We'll make that happen.

555
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,615
Speaker 1: I will teach anyone how to play 18xx.

556
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,900
Speaker 1: You just got to come to the Geeknights Discord and I will teach you to play the train game and we can play it together.

557
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe like tomorrow.

558
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:04,760
Speaker 0: We'll post it in the Discord.

559
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,040
Speaker 1: Just come to the Geeknights Discord whenever.

560
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:11,780
Speaker 1: There's a board game channel in there and you can talk to people and learn how to train.

561
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,240
Speaker 0: Otherwise, Virtual Magfest appears to have been canceled.

562
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:18,479
Speaker 0: So I guess we won't be a part of that.

563
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,459
Speaker 0: And we don't have any online cons lined up for a while yet now.

564
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:28,259
Speaker 1: We'll see which online cons actually happen and which ones don't and which ones are safe to go to and which ones aren't.

565
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:28,551
Speaker 0: Yep.

566
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,880
Speaker 0: And we'll see if and when there is a convention in 2021 that is safe to go to in person.

567
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,420
Speaker 0: Don't think the odds are great.

568
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:37,760
Speaker 1: If it's at all, it will be late in 2021.

569
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,520
Speaker 0: I don't think the odds are great in America right now for that, but we'll see.

570
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:41,913
Speaker 1: I also do not.

571
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:44,739
Speaker 0: Otherwise, yeah, we're stuck at home.

572
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:47,958
Speaker 0: Nothing new happens.

573
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,480
Speaker 0: That's why it's so hard to find openy bits.

574
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,840
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, I woke up today and my computer fan is making a little bit more noise than

575
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:55,198
Speaker 0: usual.".

576
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:57,237
Speaker 0: That's the most exciting thing that happens to me.

577
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,239
Speaker 1: Ooh, exciting.

578
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,599
Speaker 0: It actually is making a little bit of noise and I don't want to have to deal with it.

579
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:05,016
Speaker 0: I might just buy a new fan.

580
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,490
Speaker 0: The problem is I got to open the case up to figure out.

581
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,998
Speaker 0: it's like this enclosure with a bunch of fans in it.

582
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,377
Speaker 0: I'll have to like open it and like stop them all one by one to figure out which one is making the noise.

583
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:20,980
Speaker 1: But yeah, just, you know, follow us on all of the internet places because we are not shitty.

584
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,078
Speaker 1: We are not banned from them.

585
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,340
Speaker 1: So you can follow us on all those places.

586
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:36,379
Speaker 1: And as we slowly make content that we have not promised to make in any way, shape or form, but we've only hinted, yeah, stuff that, you know, working on and it'll be done whenever we feel like working on it.

587
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,259
Speaker 1: If I get off my lazy ass, who knows?

588
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:39,577
Speaker 1: You'll see it.

589
00:37:40,203 --> 00:37:41,739
Speaker 1: If you're not following us, you're going to miss it.

590
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,240
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's funny.

591
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,060
Speaker 0: I realized something during the course of this whole quarantine.

592
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:52,380
Speaker 0: The thing that lights a fire under us to get a bunch of stuff done in a hurry is always weirdly conventions.

593
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,140
Speaker 0: But it's not just we get panels done.

594
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:02,060
Speaker 0: Like I noticed this pattern, like looking at all the Ignite stuff, where there's a convention deadline, we'll like have to make a panel because we run out of time.

595
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,959
Speaker 0: We're going to be in a con and like Pax expects us to present the thing we said we'd present.

596
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,580
Speaker 0: But what's real?

597
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,539
Speaker 1: That's a real deadline.

598
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:08,896
Speaker 1: Yeah.

599
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:14,000
Speaker 0: But whenever we have a real deadline, uh, like I just, I think I saw this pattern.

600
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:20,880
Speaker 0: We tend to make a bunch of other stuff that is not related to that deadline around the time of that deadline.

601
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:22,359
Speaker 1: Like what?

602
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,299
Speaker 0: Uh, like, well, like I'll make more YouTube videos that are not the Pax panel I'm trying to put together.

603
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:30,660
Speaker 0: In the month before that Pax panel has to be ready.

604
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,598
Speaker 1: Well, I don't do that.

605
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,520
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just me.

606
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,280
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just you.

607
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,100
Speaker 0: Once the seal is broken of like, oh, I got to make something, then a bunch of other things just get made.

608
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,038
Speaker 0: Like it just happens.

609
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,138
Speaker 1: I mean, I definitely do.

610
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:46,680
Speaker 1: When there is a real legitimate deadline, like, yeah, there's a reason the thing has to be done at that time.

611
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,800
Speaker 0: It can't be a fake deadline though.

612
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,363
Speaker 0: It can't be like.

613
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:53,059
Speaker 0: if I say like, we got to finish this thing by the end of January, like neither one of us is going to do that.

614
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,340
Speaker 1: If there's a real deadline, I get it done by the date that needs to get done.

615
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,860
Speaker 1: But otherwise I get it done whenever I feel like it or never.

616
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:08,177
Speaker 0: Now what we could do is we could put $10,000 in escrow and it will like in Bitcoin and it'll be, it'll be destroyed on a date.

617
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,640
Speaker 0: If we don't upload a YouTube video of a particular length, give ourselves a hard deadline.

618
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:21,318
Speaker 1: One way to do that would be to announce or we could shit talk and make a thing, make that as a service for other people.

619
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:25,340
Speaker 1: But then use it to get us to make itself.

620
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,259
Speaker 0: You know what we just call it?

621
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,100
Speaker 0: Deadline.

622
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,540
Speaker 0: But dead is in caps.

623
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,318
Speaker 0: Deadline.tv.

624
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,440
Speaker 1: We are hired assassins.

625
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:33,018
Speaker 1: You hire it.

626
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:35,139
Speaker 1: It's legal to hire them to kill yourself.

627
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,539
Speaker 1: You've hired an assassin to kill you unless you get this thing done on a certain day.

628
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,740
Speaker 0: It's the Golgo 13.

629
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,519
Speaker 0: I'll do your stream.

630
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:44,978
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:50,480
Speaker 1: You can't hire it to kill anyone else and you can't do it to get assisted suicide either.

632
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,060
Speaker 0: That is also the plot of Bulworth.

633
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:53,374
Speaker 0: Sort of.

634
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:55,280
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you're right.

635
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:55,572
Speaker 1: Yeah.

636
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:57,835
Speaker 0: I was thinking about watching that movie again, Todd.

637
00:39:58,641 --> 00:40:07,059
Speaker 1: Thinking back to what we talked about the very beginning of the show because I still I definitely did not understand even half of what I understand about the world now when I saw that movie.

638
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:25,641
Speaker 0: Like that movie was not perfect, but much like Strange Days and RoboCop, I feel like those three movies, Bulworth, Strange Days and RoboCop were way ahead of their time and are like deeply like deeply prescient to the literal reality of the year 2020 and 2021.

639
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:28,820
Speaker 1: Well, because it was also the little reality of the years in which they were made.

640
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:29,878
Speaker 1: You just didn't realize that.

641
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:32,800
Speaker 0: All right.

642
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,180
Speaker 0: So Nerds, Nerds is a game that I didn't really notice.

643
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,279
Speaker 0: I just didn't think about it.

644
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,220
Speaker 0: And then Scott one day was like, hey, let's play Nerds.

645
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,160
Speaker 0: And I was like, okay, whatever.

646
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,999
Speaker 1: It was only like a day or two after it came out.

647
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,420
Speaker 0: I didn't even know when it came out.

648
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,519
Speaker 0: You just said, hey, we should play it.

649
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:50,740
Speaker 1: It came out very, very recently.

650
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,256
Speaker 0: It came out January 5th.

651
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,978
Speaker 0: So the Zachtronics game came out January 5th by like January 7th.

652
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:58,294
Speaker 0: We were playing it.

653
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,580
Speaker 1: So basically here's what happened.

654
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,779
Speaker 1: So Zachtronics, if you don't know, they're the ones who make all the cool programming games as well as some others.

655
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:12,782
Speaker 1: You know, for example, the Space Chem, the Codex of Chemical Engineering, TIS 100, Shenzhen IO.

656
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:13,960
Speaker 1: All right.

657
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,000
Speaker 1: They've also made the new one.

658
00:41:16,102 --> 00:41:16,640
Speaker 1: What's it called?

659
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,140
Speaker 1: Mobius Front 80 something, 86.

660
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,500
Speaker 0: That's the one I got to play.

661
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,180
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like near the top of my queue.

662
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,260
Speaker 0: Hades kind of knocked it down because Hades has like captured me first.

663
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:28,597
Speaker 1: But sure.

664
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:38,460
Speaker 1: But yeah, they make a lot of games in that sort of same vein of, you know, programming strategy, single player-ish PC games.

665
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,956
Speaker 1: Mobius Front 83, that's the year.

666
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,959
Speaker 1: And apparently what happened was when they were at their office working during lunch, they would play this card game called Nerds.

667
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,140
Speaker 1: Nerds is not a game that I knew, but apparently it's in the bicycle book.

668
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:56,420
Speaker 0: It's in the bicycle book.

669
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,620
Speaker 0: It's like one of those old card games.

670
00:41:58,363 --> 00:41:58,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

671
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,340
Speaker 1: It's an old card game that like everyone that existed for quite a while.

672
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,959
Speaker 1: I just didn't personally know about it.

673
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:14,240
Speaker 1: And I think part of the reason why I never encountered it is because unlike other card games, you actually need an entire 52 card deck per player.

674
00:42:15,342 --> 00:42:19,519
Speaker 1: And that would make it, you know, rare to be able to play Nerds.

675
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,520
Speaker 1: You would have to have someone intentionally buy a shit ton of decks and know the game.

676
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,700
Speaker 0: Now weirdly, I knew about it because people in my family played it, but I've never liked Solitaire like at all.

677
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,540
Speaker 0: Like I never played Microsoft Solitaire.

678
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,140
Speaker 1: Well, it depends which Solitaire you're talking about, right?

679
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,699
Speaker 0: I don't like 80 card solitaires of any kind.

680
00:42:36,507 --> 00:42:36,697
Speaker 1: Okay.

681
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,900
Speaker 1: Because, you know, how about, you know, like the Mahjong tile Solitaire?

682
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:40,440
Speaker 0: Not at all.

683
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,454
Speaker 0: I hate Mahjong tile.

684
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:54,000
Speaker 1: Well, I think I get, I guess it's a minor, it's not a huge pet peeve, like lectern and podium, but people say Solitaire and they mean Klondike Solitaire, when really like Freecell is also Solitaire, right?

685
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,900
Speaker 0: Solitaire is just a class of single player card games.

686
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,820
Speaker 1: Solitaire just means single player game.

687
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
Speaker 1: That's all it means, right?

688
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,511
Speaker 1: Anyway.

689
00:43:03,603 --> 00:43:05,560
Speaker 1: But yeah, Klondike Solitaire, right?

690
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,900
Speaker 1: I guess Microsoft Solitaire.

691
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,798
Speaker 1: Rym's not a fan.

692
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,076
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not like a huge fan.

693
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:09,678
Speaker 0: It's bad.

694
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,620
Speaker 0: It's just, I had better things to do like Microsoft hearts.

695
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,860
Speaker 1: I think everyone has better things to do than to play Klondike Solitaire.

696
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,440
Speaker 0: I feel like Klondike Solitaire on Windows machines got the most play in the era when most people did not have access to the internet without dialing up somewhere.

697
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,680
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

698
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:24,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

699
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:28,460
Speaker 1: It's still on, it should still be on your computer if you have a Windows computer.

700
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,860
Speaker 0: Isn't it like the Microsoft App Store now or something?

701
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,480
Speaker 1: Like, it's not there, but- You can also, you can even get it on Microsoft.

702
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:35,337
Speaker 1: It's there.

703
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,600
Speaker 1: You can even get Microsoft Solitaire on like your iPhone.

704
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:40,219
Speaker 1: Microsoft Solitaire app.

705
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,956
Speaker 0: It makes a lot of noise if you start it.

706
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what is nerds?

707
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,020
Speaker 1: Nerds is everybody or up to six people in the case of this game.

708
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,358
Speaker 1: But I guess there's no reason it couldn't be even more people.

709
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:59,180
Speaker 1: All playing Klondike Solitaire simultaneously.

710
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,680
Speaker 1: So you have it, you have your deck and you have four free piles, right?

711
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,100
Speaker 1: That all start with a card on one card each.

712
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:15,760
Speaker 1: And those are like your free work piles that, you know, you can stack things vertically, you know, with the alternating colors, just like you do in Klondike.

713
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:21,300
Speaker 1: And you have this nerds pile, which is a set of face down cards from your deck.

714
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:22,859
Speaker 1: And one of them is face up.

715
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:33,879
Speaker 1: And the only thing you can do with the nerds pile is take the top card, the face up card of the nerds pile, and put it in a legal spot and then reveal the next card of the nerds pile.

716
00:44:34,522 --> 00:44:43,219
Speaker 1: And of course your regular deck, you can draw three and then work with the top card of the three you drew and then draw three, work with the top card and eventually shuffle, right?

717
00:44:43,562 --> 00:44:44,200
Speaker 1: Just like Klondike.

718
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:48,600
Speaker 1: So you're playing this, you know, solid Klondike Solitaire-ish game.

719
00:44:49,341 --> 00:44:59,299
Speaker 1: And the difference is that the piles in which you sort of score out to where you start with, you know, you get an, you find an ace, you can put it out in those piles and then start scoring to them.

720
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,640
Speaker 1: Those piles are shared among all players.

721
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:03,900
Speaker 1: So you throw your ace of spade.

722
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:06,499
Speaker 1: You might have your two of spade getting ready to go.

723
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:09,760
Speaker 1: Someone else comes in with their two of spade and puts it on your ace of spade.

724
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,791
Speaker 1: And now you've got to hold your two of spade until another ace of spade shows up.

725
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,600
Speaker 1: Now, everyone has all four aces in their 52 card deck.

726
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:22,699
Speaker 1: So it's guaranteed that eventually, right, you're going to be able to play out.

727
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:26,660
Speaker 1: But who's going to play out first is the question.

728
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,040
Speaker 0: Now, the brilliance of this online, this game is that one is free.

729
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,199
Speaker 0: Like you can just play like this.

730
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:35,878
Speaker 1: They couldn't charge any money for this game, so they don't.

731
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:36,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

732
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,579
Speaker 0: I feel like they, if they wanted to, they could have charged like a dollar, 50 cents.

733
00:45:42,102 --> 00:45:42,420
Speaker 1: Maybe.

734
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,199
Speaker 0: You know what they go and I, if I were them, the only thing I would do is I would sell cosmetics.

735
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:53,760
Speaker 1: I mean, if you have other Zachtronics games that unlocks different cards.

736
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,198
Speaker 0: That is true.

737
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,576
Speaker 0: I saw like you, I think you or Chris had the Shenzhen deck.

738
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,353
Speaker 1: I had the TIS 100 one.

739
00:45:59,860 --> 00:45:59,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

740
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,635
Speaker 0: I don't know what any other Zachtronics games cause.

741
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:02,240
Speaker 0: they're not my jam.

742
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,138
Speaker 0: Like they're good games, but that's not the kind of game I like.

743
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,023
Speaker 0: Hmm.

744
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:13,339
Speaker 0: But, uh, the magic of this game, like the reason we're saying you should play it is that it's really easy to teach and just like dive in.

745
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:19,337
Speaker 0: Like it's a good game to play when you're having that conversation with your friends of what game should we play?

746
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:27,440
Speaker 1: Like the top right corner of the screen, after you open the game as a question mark, you click on that question mark, it brings up a screen with the instructions.

747
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:30,540
Speaker 1: It's literally like five sentences and that's all you need to know how to play.

748
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:30,803
Speaker 0: Yup.

749
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,540
Speaker 1: Five sentence instructions.

750
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,280
Speaker 0: It's actually surprisingly intense.

751
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,258
Speaker 0: Like you got to move quick.

752
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:38,020
Speaker 0: You've got to like be on point.

753
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,279
Speaker 1: This game is who you're playing against.

754
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:40,937
Speaker 0: Yeah.

755
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,857
Speaker 0: If you're playing against Scott, you gotta be on point.

756
00:46:44,781 --> 00:46:52,860
Speaker 0: Like I will get when I am a surprised at how quickly that happened, but it just only emptied the nerds pile.

757
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:53,738
Speaker 1: Don't do anything else.

758
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,076
Speaker 0: Yeah.

759
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,438
Speaker 0: Sometimes every now and then my nerds file is just like three face cards in a row.

760
00:46:58,367 --> 00:46:58,899
Speaker 1: That happens.

761
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does happen.

762
00:47:00,141 --> 00:47:11,260
Speaker 0: There's luck in this, like there's luck in all solitaire card games, but the real magic of this game, like what I love about it is that it's got a ton of style coupled with.

763
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:16,380
Speaker 0: you can see everyone else's mouse in real time.

764
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,440
Speaker 1: So that is a genius game choice there, right?

765
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,359
Speaker 1: Where anyone's mouse cursor is on the screen, you can see it.

766
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,060
Speaker 1: So when the game starts, it plays this quite long fanfare.

767
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,960
Speaker 1: This fanfare that is announcing the game is about to start.

768
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:40,599
Speaker 1: And during this time you can move your mouse around and everyone, you can sort of gesture emotionally with this, their mouse arrow, right?

769
00:47:41,022 --> 00:47:41,739
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know this.

770
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:42,780
Speaker 0: No one said anything.

771
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,900
Speaker 0: So when I was playing with Scott and a bunch of our friends on my laptop, it's just muted by default.

772
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,580
Speaker 0: Like games are muted just because, and I didn't know it was playing music.

773
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:56,419
Speaker 0: So I just thought for the first couple of games that the game was just really slow to load for some reason.

774
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,159
Speaker 0: And then Scott started singing and I was like, what, what, what's wrong with you?

775
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:01,315
Speaker 0: What's going on?

776
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:05,319
Speaker 1: You need the sound on if you, you know, in this game, if you can.

777
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:08,699
Speaker 0: All aces, no spaces.

778
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,640
Speaker 1: While you're playing, you see the mouse, you know, you can see where people are thinking about, right?

779
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:21,940
Speaker 1: If someone's mouse is like going, people tend to subconsciously move their mouse with their eyes, right?

780
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,378
Speaker 1: So if you see a mouse arrow, like going across the middle, right?

781
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,560
Speaker 1: You can sort of tell that person's looking right over there.

782
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:39,819
Speaker 1: Maybe they've got something, you know, maybe you should, if they're hovering over this three of heart, maybe then they suddenly the mouse, their arrow disappears, grab your five of heart.

783
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:41,420
Speaker 1: Cause they're about to drop a four on it.

784
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,880
Speaker 1: You can put a five down, right?

785
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:49,569
Speaker 0: The best moments are when you see something like someone to lay down like a four of hearts and two or three people simultaneously.

786
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:53,037
Speaker 0: as fast as possible, try to get that next heart over there.

787
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,660
Speaker 1: Well, I think this is also necessary.

788
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:05,480
Speaker 1: If you play this game in person, you're going to have a lot of that experience where you get, you're physically picking up a card and trying to lay it down in a pile and someone's hand gets there faster.

789
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:06,939
Speaker 1: And you're like, ah, you jerk, right?

790
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:13,600
Speaker 1: So they either had to sort of awkwardly put hands into the game, like, which is I think not a good idea.

791
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:15,680
Speaker 1: They just let everyone see everyone's mouse cursor.

792
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,599
Speaker 1: It works wonderfully.

793
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:16,932
Speaker 1: Yup.

794
00:49:17,941 --> 00:49:24,159
Speaker 0: It's, it's such a small thing, but it adds so much emotional value to like the play of the game.

795
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,780
Speaker 0: Like, you know who got in your way.

796
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,420
Speaker 0: Like you feel it viscerally the way you would in person.

797
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,440
Speaker 1: Everyone's mouse arrow is it matches their color.

798
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,717
Speaker 1: So you can tell who it was.

799
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,700
Speaker 0: And you can do things like I have moved my mouse and hovered over a card.

800
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,000
Speaker 0: I want someone else to play while yelling at them to play the two of diamonds.

801
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:41,273
Speaker 0: Jesus.

802
00:49:41,461 --> 00:49:42,597
Speaker 0: So I can play my three and four.

803
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:43,729
Speaker 1: Yup.

804
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:53,620
Speaker 1: Uh, something else in this game that I think is a negative is that you really do need to play it with a traditional computer mouse and you need to have an able.

805
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:54,578
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

806
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,780
Speaker 0: Like I'm not good at this game.

807
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:03,718
Speaker 0: Like don't think that I'm making an excuse or I am dog shit at this game, but the first several times we played, I was even worse because I was trying to use a laptop track pad.

808
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,560
Speaker 0: You cannot play this game with a laptop track pad.

809
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,179
Speaker 1: You cannot use anything other than a computer mouse.

810
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:16,180
Speaker 1: Maybe some other device could do it, but trackball might work, but like track pad fart noise.

811
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:25,560
Speaker 1: You really need a computer mouse, uh, equivalent device and you need to be able to go fast with it and precise with it, or you're going to get hosed in this game.

812
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:27,020
Speaker 1: It is not very accessible.

813
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,278
Speaker 0: You also need a, in that way, a large enough monitor to see the difference between spades and clubs.

814
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:35,520
Speaker 0: If your monitor is tiny, you will probably not be able to see that effectively.

815
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:37,579
Speaker 1: I guess that's also true.

816
00:50:37,861 --> 00:50:40,115
Speaker 0: Like a lower, like an older laptop would have trouble with this, right?

817
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:47,240
Speaker 1: If you have there, there are no subtitles and there is a small amount of the language, right?

818
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:54,279
Speaker 1: So like when someone plays an ACE to the middle, the game will say this out loud, the suit of that ACE hurts.

819
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:54,636
Speaker 1: Yeah.

820
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,338
Speaker 1: Like hearts.

821
00:50:55,721 --> 00:51:00,254
Speaker 1: So like, and that is extremely useful and important information.

822
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:06,440
Speaker 1: because even if, um, you, you know, don't have a heart to go out there right now.

823
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:08,800
Speaker 1: It's not reminding you to, you can play your hearts.

824
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:09,639
Speaker 1: Now you're two of hearts.

825
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,260
Speaker 1: It's been waiting.

826
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,738
Speaker 1: You know that other people are now playing hearts and you could think when's a lot you can feel.

827
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,820
Speaker 1: I heard heart.

828
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,677
Speaker 1: I haven't heard hearts in a while, right?

829
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,992
Speaker 1: There isn't a new ACE of, you know, cause.

830
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:21,899
Speaker 0: then you think, all right, I heard hearts a while ago.

831
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:25,620
Speaker 1: I have you draw a six of hearts and you're like, when did I last hear hearts?

832
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:30,400
Speaker 1: You can process that very quickly to decide whether to drag that six of hearts out.

833
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,466
Speaker 1: Cause what are the odds?

834
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:33,358
Speaker 1: there's a, you know, it's good to go now.

835
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:44,700
Speaker 0: So originally when we were playing this game, the one, the one other drawback, it's not really a drawback because this game is like, there's a lot of luck involved in solitaire card games, but there is luck involved.

836
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,593
Speaker 0: Like obviously skill will prevail in the long run, but your nerds pile is all Kings and Queens.

837
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:51,939
Speaker 1: You're going to have a bad time.

838
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:52,369
Speaker 0: Yup.

839
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:52,948
Speaker 0: Yeah.

840
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:56,360
Speaker 0: Your draw pile might just not have anything that can go into your buffer.

841
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,280
Speaker 1: Like it just might not be several games where I'll be sitting there just drawing through my deck repeatedly and I can't do any move whatsoever.

842
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:03,940
Speaker 1: And it has to wait for someone else to do something.

843
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,300
Speaker 0: It seems to have a fallback where if that happens for too long, it'll like reshuffle everyone's decks around.

844
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,579
Speaker 1: It doesn't, I don't know.

845
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,360
Speaker 1: It doesn't say exactly what the rules about shuffling are.

846
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,200
Speaker 1: It just sort of happens sometimes.

847
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:20,879
Speaker 1: And I think it basically, my guess is that it does it when they can tell the game is in a state where no one can do anything.

848
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Speaker 1: Then it will shuffle because when I play with a lot of players, it usually doesn't shuffle.

849
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,993
Speaker 0: So Scott, did you ever think to just read the changelog?

850
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:32,119
Speaker 0: because there's an update from January 10th that explains all of this.

851
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Speaker 1: Oh, what does it say?

852
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,780
Speaker 0: So on January 10th, they updated the game.

853
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:39,179
Speaker 0: I'm just going to read these because these will give you a sense of this is, these are all excellent game design changes.

854
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:48,139
Speaker 0: One, increase the number of per player tableau stacks to six in one to two player games and five in three player games.

855
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:48,902
Speaker 1: Oh.

856
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,659
Speaker 0: That reduces the amount of luck because when there's a small number of players, luck matters more.

857
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,519
Speaker 0: When there's a large number of players, there's more churn and you're more likely to be able to play effectively.

858
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:03,380
Speaker 1: Like even if you're also playing over several rounds, you're playing to a hundred points.

859
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:03,673
Speaker 1: Yeah.

860
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:10,660
Speaker 1: So that also eliminates luck because a good player will just score more points over several rounds and get to a hundred.

861
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:10,858
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

862
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,060
Speaker 1: And what they said to me, even if they might lose a round here or there.

863
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:14,540
Speaker 0: Exactly.

864
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:21,732
Speaker 0: The reason they made the change quote, this changes the strategy a little, but it makes the speed of gameplay consistent regardless of the number of players

865
00:53:22,877 --> 00:53:23,259
Speaker 1: because

866
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:27,859
Speaker 0: you can get more cards out of your nerds and not just be blocked on like the king of hearts that's sitting there too.

867
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:34,538
Speaker 0: They changed the rules so that when players get stuck, we end the round instead of shuffling decks for a third time.

868
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,240
Speaker 1: So, but what causes the first two shuffles?

869
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:42,440
Speaker 0: It looks like if all players have shuffled through their deck three times.

870
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:43,986
Speaker 1: Okay.

871
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,336
Speaker 0: Something like that.

872
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,060
Speaker 0: I suspect certain people we were playing with don't go through their deck that quick.

873
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,380
Speaker 0: We could, we could experiment.

874
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,520
Speaker 1: So the controls, because it is a speed game, so it's important to get the controls exactly right.

875
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:04,140
Speaker 1: So I, the first time I played, I got blitzed because what I was doing was my natural inclination of click on a card, drag it and let go.

876
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:05,834
Speaker 1: That is too slow.

877
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:07,960
Speaker 1: You will not win that way.

878
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:08,617
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

879
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,979
Speaker 0: I was twice as good when Scott pointed that out.

880
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:15,860
Speaker 1: What you do in this game, it's not obvious is click on a card to pick it up.

881
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:18,080
Speaker 1: So click, and now you have the card.

882
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:19,960
Speaker 1: You don't need to hold the mouse button down.

883
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,879
Speaker 1: You have the card and then click a second time to drop the card.

884
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:33,620
Speaker 1: If you want to send the card back to where it came, it's like, let's say you grab a five of heart, you dragging it out to the, you're, you're going out to the middle to put it onto the four of heart.

885
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,140
Speaker 1: You're going to click again and somebody else drops.

886
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,180
Speaker 1: There's first, they beat you in the speed game, right?

887
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:39,490
Speaker 1: Click.

888
00:54:39,741 --> 00:54:49,560
Speaker 1: And that will teleport that five of hearts back to where it came from, uh, rather than having to like go and aim the mouse at its original location and regular click again or whatever.

889
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:56,420
Speaker 1: And the third thing you need to know about controls is that if you press the tab key on your keyboard, right?

890
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,320
Speaker 1: The one above the caps lock, you will draw your, it will draw from your regular deck.

891
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,400
Speaker 1: So you don't have to ever click on your regular deck.

892
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,396
Speaker 1: You can keep your mouse out in the play zone, right?

893
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,800
Speaker 0: Like hovering over that King of hearts that you're like just waiting for someone to play a Jack.

894
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,100
Speaker 0: So you can throw this out when the queen comes, right?

895
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,340
Speaker 1: So there have been situations where, for example, I've got a five of heart.

896
00:55:16,742 --> 00:55:19,480
Speaker 1: I see someone else rim drops is for a heart in the middle.

897
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:20,879
Speaker 1: On the three that I was waiting for.

898
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,620
Speaker 1: Cause I don't, I don't know where my four hearts is.

899
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:24,500
Speaker 1: It's hiding somewhere in a nerd's power probably.

900
00:55:25,082 --> 00:55:27,539
Speaker 1: So I'm dragging my five out there to put it down.

901
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:31,000
Speaker 1: But I remember that I saw the six in my deck.

902
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:36,200
Speaker 1: So while I'm dragging the five out to the middle, I'm hitting that tab key, like rapid fire.

903
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:45,180
Speaker 1: And at the corner of my eye, I'm looking for that six to show up so that as soon as I see the drop that five down, I can come and grab the six and put it out there.

904
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,219
Speaker 1: Even though the six wasn't face up at the time.

905
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:51,980
Speaker 1: I've got it like reserved in that deck somewhere, right?

906
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,279
Speaker 1: I can go right back to it.

907
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,580
Speaker 1: If I, if I, unless I a modulus math my way away from it and I can't get it to show up right now, but got to try anyway.

908
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,979
Speaker 1: You know, and usually, usually it works.

909
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:10,335
Speaker 0: So yeah, this game is like a case study in minimalist reimagining of an existing traditional game.

910
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:16,660
Speaker 1: Like that's what I would do to replace the experience they had playing the same game at lunch to play with themselves.

911
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:17,819
Speaker 1: And they released it to the world.

912
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:25,280
Speaker 1: The only negative things I can say about this game besides the lack of accessibility is that it's a multiplayer only game.

913
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,480
Speaker 1: Effectively speaking, if you're going to play single player, just play Microsoft solitaire.

914
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,660
Speaker 1: There's no reason to come on, um, or freestyle or something.

915
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:37,040
Speaker 1: The only way to play multiplayer is to play with steam friends.

916
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,220
Speaker 1: It works perfectly, but you can only be people you're friends with on steam.

917
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:47,140
Speaker 1: So you open the game, you're one of your steam friends opens the game and just joins your game or you join their game or whatever.

918
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:50,660
Speaker 1: That's the only way you can't play with random internet strangers.

919
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:53,060
Speaker 1: You can't play with people on not steam.

920
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:55,239
Speaker 1: It's steam only as far as I'm aware.

921
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,619
Speaker 1: Um, so you have to be friends with people on steam and get online with them at the same time.

922
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:03,940
Speaker 1: And that is, I think going to be difficult for a lot of people.

923
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,820
Speaker 1: They won't be able to get the nerd experience.

924
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:12,591
Speaker 1: You're going to need to be part of like some gaming community, like, I don't know, a geek Knight's discord or something and say, Hey, who wants?

925
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,097
Speaker 1: say, who wants to nerds?

926
00:57:14,358 --> 00:57:15,081
Speaker 1: get people who.

927
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:19,620
Speaker 1: it's free, but you have to have steam at a computer with a mouse and a tab key on a keyboard.

928
00:57:20,161 --> 00:57:25,638
Speaker 1: You got to have to get people to be friends together on steam and get them to open nerds at the same time.

929
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:29,380
Speaker 1: So I think that's a high bar for a lot of people, right?

930
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,034
Speaker 1: That's going to keep them from playing this even at $0 free.

931
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:34,117
Speaker 0: Yup.

932
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,520
Speaker 0: Of course the alternative is online play with randos, which I don't know if that would ever be fun.

933
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,439
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying they don't have it though, right?

934
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,018
Speaker 1: Whether it's fun or not, they don't have it.

935
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,116
Speaker 1: There's only one way.

936
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,718
Speaker 1: Um, so that's that.

937
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, totally.

938
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,999
Speaker 1: We're also in game communication that I'm aware of.

939
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:56,240
Speaker 1: So you sort of have to set up a voice chat on the side to get the full fun experience.

940
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:05,220
Speaker 0: Because the, the, the, the primary, one of my relatives said, this is a common saying in Michigan phrase slightly differently, but it comes down to people play card games.

941
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,799
Speaker 0: So they have an excuse to complain about their hat.

942
00:58:08,661 --> 00:58:16,440
Speaker 0: This game is just that like, when we play it, it's just all the everyone in the table, just alternately going, Oh, come on.

943
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:18,400
Speaker 0: No, one's got a two of diamonds.

944
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,660
Speaker 0: Not one of you fuckers has a two of diamonds.

945
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:23,839
Speaker 0: No, no, Scott, you have one right there.

946
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,319
Speaker 1: And it's like, Oh, there's a lot of time.

947
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,159
Speaker 1: You can definitely see too.

948
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,820
Speaker 1: So strategy tips, right?

949
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:46,180
Speaker 1: The, you know, other than the speed tip of click to pick up, click to put down your tab key a lot is you have to maintain a one, a sort of some memory of what was in your deck the last time you shuffled through so that you could, you know, what's in there.

950
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,640
Speaker 0: So that like, you know, if it's time to go, I got a bunch of middling hearts, I got some faces like diamonds and clubs.

951
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:52,078
Speaker 0: Okay.

952
00:58:52,711 --> 00:58:52,900
Speaker 1: Right.

953
00:58:53,161 --> 00:59:15,838
Speaker 1: And also there's like wide vision of like, cause it's the board, you know, so wide, you have to be able to see, you know, the, not necessarily, you don't really have to pay attention to other people's play areas that much, but the middle area and yours, you have to like keep all those cards in your vision and in your mind at once to see all the possible places a thing can go.

954
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,638
Speaker 1: Um, and then of course the scoring is every time you put a card in the middle area, you get a point.

955
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:27,739
Speaker 1: And when someone calls nerds, any cards in your nerds pile that are left would be negative two points.

956
00:59:27,883 --> 00:59:28,092
Speaker 1: Yup.

957
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,140
Speaker 1: So just all I do is I'll just pull things out.

958
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,817
Speaker 1: If I can take the nerds card and put it somewhere, I do it.

959
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,418
Speaker 0: You don't have to get almost no matter what, just get it into your, like, into your tableau and you're done.

960
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:39,939
Speaker 0: It's gone.

961
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:49,979
Speaker 1: Even if it's really bad, even if it seems like it's a really bad card to put into my tableau, like let's say I'm sitting there and I've got an empty hole in my tableau, like any card could go there.

962
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,244
Speaker 0: Well, obviously you'd want to put a king there, but what if there's like a six of hearts that's been blocking your.

963
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:55,209
Speaker 0: I'll put it, I'll

964
00:59:55,249 --> 01:00:07,769
Speaker 1: put it to a hearts in that empty spot because even though it might be stuck there for a while and taking up a whole spot and a king would be the best to go there and not to like the worst, um, an ace of hearts is likely to show up.

965
01:00:08,065 --> 01:00:08,140
Speaker 0: Yup.

966
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,060
Speaker 1: Or more importantly, he's not going to be there that long.

967
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,273
Speaker 0: You are twice as likely to get rid of a nerd because either you'll be able to play that too.

968
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:20,499
Speaker 0: Thus allowing the next nerd to go into that slot or the nerd you couldn't see before that's visible could now be played.

969
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:21,740
Speaker 1: Exactly.

970
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:28,099
Speaker 1: That next nerd being visible is like, well, now you've got another card you can see and move around and get rid of.

971
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:33,080
Speaker 0: Like do whatever you can to see the next nerd, even if it isn't good solitaire play.

972
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,189
Speaker 1: Yup.

973
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,440
Speaker 1: I do that, uh, constantly.

974
01:00:36,863 --> 01:00:37,560
Speaker 1: It's very rare.

975
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:44,159
Speaker 1: The only time I won't do that is like if I see a move where like I can rearrange some cards and put the nerd card like under them or something like that.

976
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:46,499
Speaker 1: But other than that, yeah.

977
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:47,560
Speaker 1: Always take the nerd card.

978
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,220
Speaker 0: And the last piece of advice is honestly, you really have to concentrate and give this game your complete attention.

979
01:00:54,582 --> 01:00:58,540
Speaker 0: Like I know all the same strategies Scott knows, I'm just slower.

980
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:00,798
Speaker 0: Like that's it.

981
01:01:01,062 --> 01:01:02,118
Speaker 0: I'm just slower at it.

982
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:03,415
Speaker 1: Yup.

983
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:10,819
Speaker 1: I do kind of want to, whenever it's safe to do so, get a whole bunch of decks of cards and play in-person nerds.

984
01:01:12,941 --> 01:01:13,538
Speaker 1: That'll be fun.

985
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,960
Speaker 1: You know, it'll be a little bit more accessible, but a little bit less in some ways, right?

986
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:23,800
Speaker 0: The trickiest part is if two, like if two people try to throw a card down at the same time, it'll have to be whoever's card is laying flat.

987
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:30,100
Speaker 1: I think the trickiest part actually is that the in-person people could make mistakes, right?

988
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,140
Speaker 0: People will make a ton of mistakes.

989
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,160
Speaker 1: We see that with Spotted.

990
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,160
Speaker 0: We see that with like every game that involves real-time cards.

991
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,560
Speaker 1: And in a fast game, you don't have time to check people for mistakes.

992
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,700
Speaker 1: You know, it'll just be found out at the end or never.

993
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,700
Speaker 1: And the video game version, that obviously can't happen.

994
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,760
Speaker 1: It won't let you make an illegal move or an illegal card lay.

995
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,240
Speaker 0: Four people all try to lay the same card on the same spot.

996
01:01:53,704 --> 01:01:55,540
Speaker 0: Someone had better frame timing and gets it.

997
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,031
Speaker 0: Like that's it.

998
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,540
Speaker 1: As opposed to we hurt our hands or arguing or yeah, who knows what.

999
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,460
Speaker 0: I don't think you could play this with six people reasonably in person.

1000
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,377
Speaker 0: I'd like to try it.

1001
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,820
Speaker 1: They did it in person at their office.

1002
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,940
Speaker 1: That's the only reason during lunchtime.

1003
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,739
Speaker 1: That's the only reason that they made this to replace that.

1004
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:22,720
Speaker 0: So my guess is that the reason they could is that they'd been playing it for so long and so intensely that they're like the pros.

1005
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:27,120
Speaker 0: I think our group of friends could play this in person with a little bit of practice.

1006
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,139
Speaker 0: I just don't think most people could.

1007
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:30,860
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1008
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,300
Speaker 0: I think that would be a difficult ask of many groups of gamers.

1009
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,799
Speaker 0: But yeah, this game is totally worth playing if you can find some people to play it with.

1010
01:02:40,247 --> 01:02:40,340
Speaker 1: Yep.

1011
01:02:41,142 --> 01:02:41,740
Speaker 1: Zero dollars.

1012
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:45,660
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1013

1019
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,820
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1020

Speaker 0: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol and Kiji Graham Finch.

1021
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,199
Speaker 0: You hold the key to my heart.

1022
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:27,300
Speaker 0: Now go through the last year or so of podcasts and make Rim sing.

1023
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:42,199
Speaker 0: Clinton Walton, Wren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Review Mad Bull 34 cowards, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Just Like a Dude Guy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin Von Hall, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their name out loud on the show.

1024
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:54,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're listening to the show right after we put it out, I suggest you go watch, say, the House Rules Committee, where they are moving forward with impeachment of our traitorous president.

1025
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,914
Speaker 0: But now I leave you with...

1026
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:04,960
Speaker 2: It is clear the President of the United States incited this insurrection, which is clearly an impeachable offense.

1027
01:04:05,781 --> 01:04:07,679
Speaker 2: He has had almost a week to do the right thing.

1028
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:09,359
Speaker 2: He has refused to resign.

1029
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:11,460
Speaker 2: He has failed to take responsibility.

1030
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,399
Speaker 2: He has demonstrated no remorse.

1031
01:04:14,065 --> 01:04:18,698
Speaker 2: Vice President Mike Pence, for his part, has also so far refused to invoke the 25th Amendment.

1032
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,440
Speaker 2: We have been left with no other option than to consider the second impeachment of Donald J. Trump.

1033
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,739
Speaker 2: None of us wants to be in this room today.

1034
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:38,480
Speaker 2: Instead of preparing for the inauguration of a new president, we have new fences surrounding the Capitol, thousands of National Guard troops protecting the nation's Capitol, and every day we learn about new threats to our democracy.

1035
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:55,280
Speaker 2: That is why today, with the support of 217 of our colleagues, I have the solemn responsibility to present for your consideration House Resolution 24 and the accompanying report relating to the impeachment of Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.

1036
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,960
Speaker 2: We must act now to remove President Trump from office.

1037
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:03,840
Speaker 2: For a moment, let's go back to the events of the morning of Wednesday, January 6.

1038
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:16,480
Speaker 2: Pursuant to the 12th Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Vice President of the United States, the House of Representatives, and the Senate prepared to gather at the United States Capitol for a joint session of Congress to count the votes of the Electoral College.

1039
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,579
Speaker 2: This is the moment when hundreds of millions of votes are counted and the peaceful transition of power begins.

1040
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,780
Speaker 2: This is a sacred ritual of our democracy.

1041
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,419
Speaker 2: Less than two miles away at the Ellipse, a different gathering was underway.

1042
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,980
Speaker 2: Thousands of President Trump's most dyad supporters gathered as a result of the president's calling people to Washington.

1043
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:47,540
Speaker 2: Shortly after Congress began to carry out its constitutional duty, a violent mob stormed the Capitol building armed with guns, bats, shields, zip ties, and chemical spray.

1044
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,000
Speaker 2: Some wore clothing promoting the QAnon conspiracy.

1045
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:57,220
Speaker 2: Others carried the battle flag of the Confederacy, a potent symbol of slavery, racism, and treason.

1046
01:05:57,981 --> 01:06:01,880
Speaker 2: There is no question that the insurrection at the Capitol was incited by the president.

1047
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:10,299
Speaker 2: However, this is not just about what President Trump did on January 6 to incite the insurrection, but also what he did in the months leading up to that fateful day.

1048
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:16,340
Speaker 2: On December 19, for example, he tweeted, and I quote, "Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 election.

1049
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,152
Speaker 2: Big protest in D.C.

1050
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,601
Speaker 2: on January 6.

1051
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,045
Speaker 2: Be there.

1052
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:20,469
Speaker 2: We'll be

1053
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:20,974
Speaker 2: wild.".

1054
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:32,720
Speaker 2: The report that has been submitted to the committee clearly lays out the case for impeachment and details a pattern of behavior by President Trump who has attempted for months to maintain power by subverting the will of the American people.

1055
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:42,739
Speaker 2: After his loss to President-elect Biden, President Trump filed 62 frivolous lawsuits, raising baseless claims of election fraud, which were quickly rejected by the courts.

1056
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:51,660
Speaker 2: He requested an investigation by the Department of Justice, which just as quickly closed its investigation into vote tabulation irregularities based on a lack of evidence.

1057
01:06:52,280 --> 01:07:03,209
Speaker 2: On December 23, President Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to request that he "find" enough votes to reverse the Georgia presidential election results and threaten Mr.

1058
01:07:03,249 --> 01:07:05,737
Speaker 2: Raffensperger with criminal penalties if he failed to do so.

1059
01:07:06,585 --> 01:07:19,440
Speaker 2: In the run-up to last Wednesday's insurrection, President Trump also pressured Vice President Pence to reject the electoral votes of states he lost, a request the Vice President refused to do because doing so would have been illegal.

1060
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,999
Speaker 2: Desperately running out of options, President Trump called on his supporters to fight for him.

1061
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:37,139
Speaker 2: On January 1, the President directed his supporters to come to Washington to rally for the express purpose of overturning the results of the November 2020 presidential election, tweeting, "The big protest rally in Washington, D.C.

1062
01:07:37,723 --> 01:07:39,153
Speaker 2: will take place at 11 a.m.

1063
01:07:39,234 --> 01:07:40,540
Speaker 2: on January 6.

1064
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,189
Speaker 2: Location details to follow.

1065
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,235
Speaker 2: Stop the

1066
01:07:43,295 --> 01:07:43,637
Speaker 2: steal.".

1067
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:47,498
Speaker 2: The day before the rally, he called on his supporters to step up and fight back.

1068
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:56,058
Speaker 2: On January 6, thousands of President Trump supporters gathered to attend the Save America rally at the Ellipse, which is just south of the White House.

1069
01:07:56,821 --> 01:08:01,859
Speaker 2: That morning was his last-dish attempt to maintain power and overturn the results of the presidential election.

1070
01:08:02,464 --> 01:08:13,180
Speaker 2: In the hours before the Save America rally, the President tweeted 12 times, continuing to spread false claims that the election was rigged and encouraging his supporters to fight and be strong.

1071
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:22,212
Speaker 2: During the rally, several of President Trump's allies spoke in sincere terms on his behalf, including his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, who said, "Let's have trial by

1072
01:08:22,354 --> 01:08:22,798
Speaker 2: combat.".

1073
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:24,573
Speaker 2: The President's son, Donald Trump

1074
01:08:24,613 --> 01:08:24,654
Speaker 2: Jr.,

1075
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:30,594
Speaker 2: warned Republican Congress members that if they did not support his father, quote, "We're coming for you,".

1076
01:08:30,776 --> 01:08:31,160
Speaker 2: end quote.

1077
01:08:31,743 --> 01:08:33,759
Speaker 2: President Trump was the last speaker at the rally.

1078
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,799
Speaker 2: He continued to insist falsely that he'd won the election on the land side.

1079
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,540
Speaker 2: He encouraged the crowd to fight much harder.

1080
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:48,419
Speaker 2: President Trump attacked members of his own party, saying that he got to get rid of the weak Congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, like Liz Cheney's of the world.

1081
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:55,854
Speaker 2: And in a parting admonition to the crowd, he warned, and I quote, "If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,".

1082
01:08:56,077 --> 01:08:56,439
Speaker 2: end quote.

1083
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,179
Speaker 2: President's supporters took him at his word.

1084
01:08:59,724 --> 01:09:01,139
Speaker 2: We all witnessed what happened next.

1085
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:05,439
Speaker 2: Thousands of angry, violent domestic terrorists stormed the Capitol building.

1086
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:18,100
Speaker 2: They scaled walls, shattered windows, and left a path of destruction in their wake to facing historic statutes, destroying monuments, and smearing their feces, blood, and urine throughout the halls of Congress.

1087
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:22,738
Speaker 2: In the ensuing conflict, five people were killed, including a Capitol police officer.

1088
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:27,959
Speaker 2: Members of Congress, the Vice President, congressional staff, and members of the press fled for their lives.

1089
01:09:28,505 --> 01:09:32,220
Speaker 2: And the joint session certifying the Electoral College results was delayed.

1090
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:40,120
Speaker 2: Even when it was clear that things had gotten completely out of control, President Trump released a video on Twitter where he failed to denounce the attack.

1091
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,335
Speaker 2: In fact, he told the writers, and I quote, "We love you, you're very special,".

1092
01:09:44,537 --> 01:09:44,899
Speaker 2: end quote.

1093
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:52,538
Speaker 2: Instead of lowering the temperature and trying to restore order, President Trump doubled down on his false claim, and he said, "The election was stolen from us.

1094
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,935
Speaker 2: It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it,".

1095
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:55,540
Speaker 2: end quote.

1096
01:09:56,284 --> 01:09:58,840
Speaker 2: Once again, the President has left us no choice.

1097
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,800
Speaker 2: Congress must impeach the President immediately.

1098
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,759
Speaker 2: The framers anticipated the exact circumstances that bring us here today.

1099
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:15,540
Speaker 2: One of their chief concerns was to provide adequate safeguards to protect against corruption and preserve the integrity of the democratic process, especially our sacred elections.

1100
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:26,339
Speaker 2: For this reason, the framers provided the House of Representatives with the sole power of impeachment and the Senate with the authority to conduct a trial where the President has afforded ample due process rights under the law.

1101
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:36,479
Speaker 2: Separate and apart from these proceedings, the 14th Amendment recognizes that there must be accountability for anyone who has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the people of the United States.

1102
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:44,920
Speaker 2: By endangering Congress and the democratic process, President Trump violated his oath to the Constitution and threatened to topple the Republic.

1103
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:53,220
Speaker 2: He incited the January 6th insurrection for one purpose, to maintain the presidency at all costs, despite the will of the American people.

1104
01:10:53,824 --> 01:10:58,160
Speaker 2: The President is a clear and present danger to our democracy and our national security.

1105
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,700
Speaker 2: He must be removed from office immediately.

1106
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:09,299
Speaker 2: It's clear to everyone that the violent attack on the Capitol was a direct result of the President's conduct, not only this past Wednesday, but also in the last few months.

1107
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:23,860
Speaker 2: By encouraging a violent mob to storm the Capitol last Wednesday, with the purpose of overturning the legitimate result of last November's presidential election, President Donald J. Trump did, in fact, commit high crimes and misdemeanors against the people of the United States.

1108
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,339
Speaker 2: The world saw what happened last Wednesday at the United States Capitol.

1109
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,819
Speaker 2: We were all here and witnessed it firsthand.

1110
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,960
Speaker 2: I challenge anyone to tell me differently.

1111
01:11:33,562 --> 01:11:34,739
Speaker 2: It could not be more clear.

1112
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,979
Speaker 2: In the day since, more and more evidence has emerged that the same people who carried out this assault are planning to do even worse.

1113
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:42,839
Speaker 2: We cannot let them succeed.

1114
01:11:43,442 --> 01:11:51,180
Speaker 2: We must send a message to the American people that we will uphold our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1115
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:58,540
Speaker 2: Last Wednesday, the President of the United States incited the insurrection at the citadel of our democracy, the United States Capitol.

1116
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:03,900
Speaker 2: All of us here tonight have a responsibility to defend this sacred institution and our great democracy.

1117
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:09,279
Speaker 2: And most importantly, we must preserve our great republic for all future generations.

1118
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:10,915
Speaker 2: And with that, I yield back, Mr.

1119
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:11,119
Speaker 2: Chairman.
