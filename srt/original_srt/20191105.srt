1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,385
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday November 5th 2019.

2
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:14,847
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,838
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,700
Speaker 0: tonight We are talking about the untitled goose game.

5
00:00:24,165 --> 00:00:25,198
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,532
Speaker 0: So it was finally time to buy a new laptop.

7
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:33,144
Speaker 0: my plan for my laptop to last a decade Totally worked.

8
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,800
Speaker 0: I bought a fancy laptop a decade ago, and it's on its last goddamn legs.

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:44,260
Speaker 1: I just switched iPad and I only use my laptop in like emergency situations when I need it and so works.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually do use laptops.

11
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:49,177
Speaker 1: I might put some Linux on it instead of the windows.

12
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,745
Speaker 1: That's on it though Because it's kind of sad.

13
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:55,299
Speaker 1: I mean you try to turn it on and it's like oh really you're turning me on.

14
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:57,365
Speaker 0: My laptop is falling.

15
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:02,540
Speaker 0: it boots quick battery still lasts like three or four hours unless I'm playing games with it.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,074
Speaker 0: Then it lasts like an hour now because the battery is ten years old.

17
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,884
Speaker 0: the main problems with it Were that one.

18
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:09,160
Speaker 0: the battery is held in with tape.

19
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,516
Speaker 0: I recently replaced that tape because the tape gave way the other day, and I lost some work.

20
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:20,875
Speaker 0: I was working on and the screen resolution By modern standards is basically like 40p.

21
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,486
Speaker 0: It's like 1366 by whatever.

22
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:28,339
Speaker 0: that stupid form factor is only five peas not many peas.

23
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:33,360
Speaker 0: So I got a laptop that has a lot of peas.

24
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:42,820
Speaker 0: Even a crappy laptop you buy today has mad P Yep, but the other day don't forget a decade ago that Lenovo was a top-of-the-line laptop.

25
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, a long-ass time.

26
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:46,434
Speaker 0: That's Hane years ago.

27
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:47,960
Speaker 1: What the hell year did I even get mine in?

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,100
Speaker 0: I know I got mine in 2009 because I remember very specifically planning even talked about on gig night.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
Speaker 0: So this is gonna be a 10-year laptop because I spent like four fucking thousand dollars on it.

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,806
Speaker 1: I didn't spend that much.

31
00:01:59,028 --> 00:01:59,532
Speaker 1: Let me look up.

32
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:00,620
Speaker 0: I mean that laptop.

33
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:06,124
Speaker 0: I bought a core i7 on a laptop back before direct sales in 2010.

34
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:06,846
Speaker 1: I think this is it.

35
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,680
Speaker 0: I mean that laptop had a fancy SSD that was very high capacity.

36
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:15,053
Speaker 0: Before SSDs were default standard on every laptop.

37
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:19,203
Speaker 1: like yeah, I guess I bought the laptop in 2010.

38
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:26,780
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, this must be it Which works out because the previous laptop I bought was the Fujitsu life book.

39
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:29,420
Speaker 0: I do not buy laptops many often very often.

40
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:37,020
Speaker 0: I think this is my third laptop because I continue to buy extremely expensive laptops and use them for goddamn ever.

41
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I bought the Fujitsu in beacons like 2005.

42
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that lasted five years.

43
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:46,014
Speaker 1: in 2010 I bought the Lenovo and then I bought the iPad.

44
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,950
Speaker 1: a few years ago I don't know when did I buy that stupid iPad?

45
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,900
Speaker 0: you've already had it for a few years now.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,354
Speaker 1: This is actually the second I've had.

47
00:02:52,476 --> 00:03:09,700
Speaker 0: yeah Well, it's actually I had a mini iPad and then the pro iPad and then the even pro where I've had yeah, but I did something different because My plan was to buy a surface book 3 because Microsoft is really bad at naming things.

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,146
Speaker 0: So the so yeah, bro is the less powerful Tablety one.

49
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:18,563
Speaker 0: but the surface laptop is also not that powerful It's just a normal laptop.

50
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:26,023
Speaker 0: and then the surface book is actually the crazy powerful desktop replacement one and Also a tablet.

51
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:26,826
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:29,575
Speaker 0: That's the one that has a fucking like real video chip in it.

53
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:30,919
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm like a gtx-6.

54
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,065
Speaker 0: 1060 is what's in there?

55
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,532
Speaker 1: No, it's like some mobile version.

56
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,858
Speaker 0: No, it's a it's what do you mean?

57
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:36,400
Speaker 0: a mobile version?

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,185
Speaker 0: That would be the 1050.

59
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,401
Speaker 0: This is the 1060.

60
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, they make a lot of things have the same number, but it's not actually the same.

61
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:49,877
Speaker 0: Benchmark wise benchmarks the same as 1060 with the caveat that it cannot overclock itself because it cannot cool itself.

62
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:51,979
Speaker 0: that well Because it's in a laptop.

63
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:59,028
Speaker 0: but I got the laptop as opposed to the book partly because I Really need a new laptop.

64
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:06,646
Speaker 0: The old one's not doing it for me, but to As much as I wanted to get a laptop that's crazy powerful like I always have.

65
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:17,512
Speaker 0: like I could render video on this if I need to I Have never actually needed for like five years now to edit Serious video on the go.

66
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:18,858
Speaker 0: it can always wait till I get home.

67
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:22,159
Speaker 0: So this laptop can edit video enough on the go.

68
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:30,498
Speaker 0: So I saved myself like a thousand dollars by getting a normal laptop Instead of a laptop that could be a full desktop workstation replacement.

69
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:34,257
Speaker 0: Weirdly prudent of me in the laptop department.

70
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:38,886
Speaker 0: Another Opening news or opening bits.

71
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:39,990
Speaker 0: the election just happened.

72
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,896
Speaker 1: No, it didn't finish it.

73
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:42,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's happening.

74
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:46,853
Speaker 0: I forget when the polls closed because New York has early voting now.

75
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:48,620
Speaker 0: I voted over the weekend like a pro.

76
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,706
Speaker 0: You do you vote really?

77
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:50,967
Speaker 0: I forget.

78
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:52,515
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't need to vote early.

79
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:53,460
Speaker 1: I had to go farther away.

80
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,485
Speaker 1: So I voted this morning.

81
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:59,508
Speaker 0: See we could vote at the Museum of the Moving Image, which is like yeah That could have voted there also for us.

82
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,139
Speaker 0: That's not really further away than our regular polling place.

83
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:09,216
Speaker 0: Hmm So, uh, we don't know the results the elections happening right now, but based on some tentative numbers.

84
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,360
Speaker 0: I saw an interesting thing.

85
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,459
Speaker 0: I hope this is a real trend.

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,933
Speaker 0: Turnout appears to be really really really high like crazy high.

87
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:18,294
Speaker 0: Yeah.

88
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:23,413
Speaker 0: Well people, you know, we're talking like 20 22 percent of voters.

89
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,840
Speaker 1: people are much more upset.

90
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,951
Speaker 1: They want to vote and now it's easier to vote with the early voting.

91
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:37,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this is an off-year election If you're not Americans every four years We have a quote-unquote real election meaning like presidents and shit get voted for.

92
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:45,881
Speaker 0: That's every four years and like 40% of us vote in these things maybe 50%.

93
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:50,780
Speaker 0: Every other year we have a midterm election, which is like the middle of a president's term.

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,967
Speaker 1: That's because well, it's the House of Representatives.

95
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,033
Speaker 1: half of the Congress is out.

96
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,000
Speaker 1: It has to be elected every two years.

97
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,466
Speaker 0: You got to keep getting elected.

98
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:02,160
Speaker 1: so basically some some of them like people died or quit and stuff.

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,165
Speaker 1: So some of those elections, you know happen in the middle years, but most of them are Every two years.

100
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:13,603
Speaker 1: so you go to vote for a president and you vote for the house and then two years later It's like house only.

101
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:18,500
Speaker 1: Yep, and they usually like some senators and senators every fucking six years.

102
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:23,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like any year at random depending on where the hell you live.

103
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:30,193
Speaker 1: Oh, by the way one of your two senators, yep, and those are only the federal elections every state is different and then every town is different.

104
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:35,972
Speaker 0: Yep, and Then there's yet another kind of election the off-year election.

105
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:39,101
Speaker 0: most Americans barely know these exist and they don't vote in them Right.

106
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:43,216
Speaker 1: Well, I mean depending odd-numbered years every single leaf years like 2019 is an off.

107
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,240
Speaker 1: Well, every single thing we voted for just now today was New York City specific.

108
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,084
Speaker 1: Not there wasn't.

109
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:53,320
Speaker 1: there wasn't even a single New York State thing to vote on.

110
00:06:53,741 --> 00:07:02,926
Speaker 1: So you could live in somewhere else in New York State and if there was nothing in your town Happening that year based on your town charter or whatever the fuck you live There's literally you would go.

111
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,231
Speaker 1: there would be nothing to vote on today.

112
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:08,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, there would be no just literally nothing Like judges.

113
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:10,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually it's judges.

114
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:13,406
Speaker 1: It depends where you live there But judges are really easy to vote for.

115
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:16,700
Speaker 0: just always vote for all Democrats and never anyone else under any circumstances.

116
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,507
Speaker 0: Like don't even look these people up doesn't matter.

117
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:19,189
Speaker 1: It depends.

118
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,615
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't depend any.

119
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:30,233
Speaker 1: what if you happen to know Let know that like in your town the crazy judge like got you know on to the distance Shenanigans and got on as a Democrat or you know, it's still better

120
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:31,840
Speaker 0: to vote for that than someone who's a Republican

121
00:07:32,563 --> 00:07:34,310
Speaker 1: I mean, but they are Republican.

122
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,217
Speaker 1: They're just on the Democratic part of the ballot.

123
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:39,833
Speaker 0: Yeah Shenanigans, that's pretty rare at that level.

124
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,480
Speaker 1: It's actually surprisingly not rare.

125
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:54,220
Speaker 0: It's usually more that it doesn't matter because most of those judge elections are either unopposed or It's like vote for six and there are six Democrats and like one Republican and no one else is even running.

126
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:56,519
Speaker 0: Like there aren't options in those elections.

127
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:01,260
Speaker 0: Anyway, I hope you voted and New York City will be interesting because it's not in the voter.

128
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:07,200
Speaker 0: One of the things we got to vote on is whether or not our own city will do a form of ranked choice voting.

129
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,944
Speaker 1: It's IRV.

130
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:12,140
Speaker 1: so the thing is that mean it'll only apply to city election.

131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,327
Speaker 1: So for mayor you'll be like this is my bet the best mayor the second best mayor the third best mayor and you can vote For as many as you want to like.

132
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:21,100
Speaker 1: I'll just pick one and if they don't win, I don't fucking care who wins.

133
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,506
Speaker 1: Oh, right But the thing is it'll.

134
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:28,980
Speaker 1: I think it'll be weird like we go to vote for mayor in two years And it's like well at the same time.

135
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,687
Speaker 0: Well, as he was not my first choice, but he'll be my second choice, but it's like well, he's not gonna be on the thing All right.

136
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:34,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's done.

137
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:36,467
Speaker 1: You're gonna go for Cory?

138
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,620
Speaker 1: probably yeah, so unless someone else appears.

139
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:46,660
Speaker 1: So the point is if the city things you're gonna be doing these rankings Right, and then if there's non city things you're gonna be doing regular.

140
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,532
Speaker 1: So it's like in the ballot would be mixed between ranking and not.

141
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:49,934
Speaker 1: okay.

142
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:55,880
Speaker 0: It'll be a little little messy Yep, but it might mean New York City has a better chances of putting actual progressives in power.

143
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,211
Speaker 1: No, I mean, you know even even with the old voting.

144
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably still gonna get covered.

145
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:08,458
Speaker 0: Yeah So, I don't think it'll matter too much But anyway, let's give them some gaming news because you guys don't care about this stuff that much even though you should.

146
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:09,362
Speaker 0: all things are Political.

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,080
Speaker 0: so, uh first and foremost, this is just really funny.

148
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:16,939
Speaker 0: This is like what does Scott say in the discord the most geek nights news, right?

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,712
Speaker 1: So there was a fortnight tournament and the fortnight tournament.

150
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:24,489
Speaker 1: I don't know the structure of a fortnight tournament, whatever It doesn't matter play your fortnight, right?

151
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:32,255
Speaker 1: This was a third party tournament So it wasn't run by epic, but it was run by a legit organization with real prizes.

152
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, really trying to keep shit together.

153
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:49,764
Speaker 1: the Vanish Cup, right and They have some sort of system I don't know the full details of Where there is some sort of support from epic for like running the tournament where there's like some codes and they give the codes To the participants.

154
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:53,980
Speaker 1: so to it's like matchmake only the tournament participants.

155
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:55,407
Speaker 1: So no one can like.

156
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:57,740
Speaker 1: no public people can like sneak into the games.

157
00:09:58,342 --> 00:10:02,780
Speaker 1: Right, you know, it's basically the equivalent of like passwords and the counter-strike server kind of thing.

158
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's a matchmaking involved to some kind.

159
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:12,340
Speaker 0: now It's cool because that means you there can be tournaments like eSports usually like there's physical concerns and all this nonsense.

160
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:17,460
Speaker 0: But this kind of tournament anyone who qualifies right can compete from anywhere in the world.

161
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:34,340
Speaker 1: Right now the thing is these kinds of third-party tournaments happen in all sorts of video games competitive video games with Limited or no support from the actual game company and usually this third-party software Yeah, all sorts of ramshackle duct tape solutions.

162
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:42,999
Speaker 0: I remember competing in Quake tournaments where like legit Someone would call you on the phone and tell you an IP address to connect to.

163
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,200
Speaker 1: right.

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,782
Speaker 1: There's a lot of tournaments where it's like, you know befriend, you know It's like.

165
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:52,299
Speaker 1: they'll send you like the steam ID or you know Basically the ID of the person you have to play against.

166
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:59,400
Speaker 1: Yeah Connect you friend them and connect to them and play them and then both of you report your results to the tournament organizer.

167
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,075
Speaker 1: I won right?

168
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:05,117
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, or send you know stream or you know, but you can't.

169
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:11,098
Speaker 0: if they're clever They'll have like saw judge whose job is to like spectate in your game like depends on the game.

170
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,205
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, stuff like that.

171
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:24,620
Speaker 1: So the point is for this particular fortnight tournament Some people who knows we don't know even three people right Decided to grief the fuck out of the tournament.

172
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:29,454
Speaker 1: They they had the code so they must have either gotten the codes from players or where

173
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:30,116
Speaker 0: it was them

174
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:42,020
Speaker 1: or was them with different accounts that were anonymous and they went into the game as a team and basically like Spammed and shot rockets everywhere and grief the hell out of everybody.

175
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:45,498
Speaker 0: They like back-to-back and just teamed up and fucked everybody over, right?

176
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:53,377
Speaker 1: It would be like if you know we've had a counter-attack tournament and then we just like Join and like start a team killing and nobody could get a game going on.

177
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,040
Speaker 1: That was legit.

178
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:58,740
Speaker 1: So rather that they couldn't do anything about these griefers because they don't have enough.

179
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 1: It's all you know, they don't have enough support from epic.

180
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, so they just had to cancel their whole fucking tournament.

181
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:28,320
Speaker 1: We just go, you know, it goes back to a general point I want to make again and again until someone fucking gets it right is basically There's no video game out there competitive multiplayer game even in 2019. there's basically none that has full real tournaments organized tournament support in game.

182
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:35,080
Speaker 1: Right, that is perfect and complete such to the point where you won't even need third-party tournament organizers.

183
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,894
Speaker 1: People should be able to open the game.

184
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:39,020
Speaker 0: I should be able to go to overwatch.

185
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:41,787
Speaker 1: Real people right.

186
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:51,292
Speaker 1: join a real legit organized tournament and the game takes care of everything for you And you can customize the formats and do all these these really basic things.

187
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:55,083
Speaker 1: make sure people show up and force the rules Right.

188
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:55,786
Speaker 1: make sure right.

189
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:56,708
Speaker 1: nobody.

190
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,280
Speaker 1: zero games that I'm aware of have built this thing.

191
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,994
Speaker 0: I feel like a game that you can build.

192
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,100
Speaker 0: that right, right?

193
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:17,040
Speaker 1: I feel like you could build a really simple game Right, like a really man kind of game not just something good enough and then just build a really strong tournament system and people would play it just because.

194
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,619
Speaker 1: Wow, I can play real legit competitive tournaments in this thing.

195
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:31,300
Speaker 1: Right, like you go to say you've met your local game store and you go for like Friday night magic or whatever And that tournament is better organized than any video game has tournament

196
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:40,575
Speaker 0: Unless it's video game tournaments run by the companies that make the games Because they use the kinds of like internal tools that players don't have access to or they're

197
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,200
Speaker 1: usually in physical spaces.

198
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just controlling everything.

199
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,796
Speaker 0: They do things like make a special build of the game.

200
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:47,980
Speaker 0: That's only for the tournament.

201
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:53,300
Speaker 0: Yes, like developers are like hacking stuff together all sorts of not usually when it's in person.

202
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:58,069
Speaker 1: You just don't have to worry about so many of the concerns you have with the online turn But there's something else going on.

203
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,199
Speaker 0: You don't need the tooling.

204
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:03,340
Speaker 0: I think it's very easy to explain why this happened in this particular tournament.

205
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:09,280
Speaker 0: The prize pool for this tournament was a total of three thousand dollars.

206
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:13,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the odds of winning any reasonable out of money are pretty low.

207
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:18,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to be basically in first place to win any written, you know meaningful amount of money, but

208
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:27,032
Speaker 0: If you just assume you're not gonna win money from this tournament anyway Griefing a tournament that's being live streamed on such a scale the

209
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:27,835
Speaker 1: amount of really

210
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:28,277
Speaker 0: funny

211
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:32,497
Speaker 1: the amount of fun You would get from that is worth more than the prize that winning

212
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,224
Speaker 0: like My utility.

213
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,752
Speaker 0: if I was in this game if I was part of that that crew.

214
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,980
Speaker 1: also the culture of fortnight the game doesn't help.

215
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:42,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the culture of fortnight is just jump around hitting people with a dildo.

216
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:46,666
Speaker 1: It's not a super serious game Right a super serious game.

217
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,640
Speaker 1: the griefing would have been met with much different, you know, right like if it was pub G.

218
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,260
Speaker 0: I feel like the griefing would have been met with other players.

219
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,651
Speaker 0: Here's all summing up to get rid of the reefers.

220
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:56,917
Speaker 0: Here's all someone has to do.

221
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:57,660
Speaker 1: make a game.

222
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,379
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what fucking game it is.

223
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,960
Speaker 1: It has to have just as long as it's some amount of skill in the game doesn't have to be a full skill game.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,535
Speaker 1: it could even be a mostly random game.

225
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:15,964
Speaker 1: right and Make a system where people create a tournament right enter the tournament possibly even with an entry fee could be like a dollar $10 whatever.

226
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:20,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, right you the game maker take a cut of the total entry fees, right?

227
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,640
Speaker 1: So let's say it's a $10 entry fee 10 players in the tournament.

228
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:32,291
Speaker 1: So maybe they could make the poker casino and write the big you take a dollar Right as the cost to start to launch a tournament.

229
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:35,460
Speaker 1: Everyone pays a dollar to join a tournament, right?

230
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,951
Speaker 1: The winner of the tournament gets the $10.

231
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,200
Speaker 1: what something simple like that is the problem.

232
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:46,660
Speaker 0: I feel like the governments of the world would regulate and be mad about that.

233
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,710
Speaker 0: It's a skill based game.

234
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:55,020
Speaker 0: Like you can't fight with gambling I feel like they might just pass laws and crack down on that because they care way more about that kind of thing.

235
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,104
Speaker 0: Then they care about.

236
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:56,846
Speaker 1: I mean Belgium.

237
00:15:56,906 --> 00:16:00,318
Speaker 1: Belgium would wisely but I think is I actually have no problem with that.

238
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,664
Speaker 0: It's like Perception wise.

239
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:03,990
Speaker 0: they go after that problem.

240
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,160
Speaker 0: They would go after this loot crate bullshit.

241
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,305
Speaker 0: That's the actual problem.

242
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,153
Speaker 1: Some places are going after the loot crate bullshit.

243
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:10,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like it's like you.

244
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:10,880
Speaker 1: look at magic cards.

245
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,460
Speaker 1: I have a problem with paying for a pack of cards with random shit.

246
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,820
Speaker 1: That's the gambling part the playing magic and whoever wins the magic tournament gets a prize.

247
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,865
Speaker 1: I have no problem with that.

248
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,150
Speaker 1: That's a skill bait.

249
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,295
Speaker 1: most at least, you know, there's.

250
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,420
Speaker 1: everyone has the same cards.

251
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,020
Speaker 1: You know netrunner tournaments a better example, but it's like you play the game and whoever wins gets the prize.

252
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,106
Speaker 1: That's totally fair.

253
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,645
Speaker 1: As long as it's you know, not some bullshit game Right.

254
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,400
Speaker 1: So it's like I actually am okay with.

255
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:45,200
Speaker 1: Everyone puts in a dollar the game company keeps all the dollars and whoever wins the tournament gets ten dollars worth of loot.

256
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:50,720
Speaker 0: So I had friends who made a lot of money doing that in middle school with magic tournaments.

257
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:57,305
Speaker 0: They were just put flyers all around the school like hey magic tournament on Saturday this kid's house $10 entry fee.

258
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:59,071
Speaker 1: but that's what game stores do.

259
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like no.

260
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:14,586
Speaker 1: video game Digital the online multiplayer game of any genre has implemented that local game store tournament mechanism Digitally such that that kind of tournament could just happen all day long Constantly even for no money.

261
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,372
Speaker 1: money or not, right?

262
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:17,877
Speaker 1: There is none that do this.

263
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:18,660
Speaker 1: do it now.

264
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,198
Speaker 1: So shit like this can stop happening.

265
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:21,905
Speaker 1: What is taking so long?

266
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:32,497
Speaker 0: what I'm also kind of waiting for is we have not seen like an ultimate Griefing moment in a bigger eSports tournament because the bigger eSports tournaments are all in person.

267
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:35,479
Speaker 1: once you get big enough It's suddenly in person and not online anymore.

268
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:41,580
Speaker 1: Right all in all and even like the serious online ones have a lot more controls in place.

269
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:52,880
Speaker 1: So, you know unless you have a the equivalent of like the basketball player just like hold off and punch someone These are tournaments that like the you know are not like, you know, they're like small things off.

270
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,019
Speaker 1: There's like minor league baseball like you would never see it.

271
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,507
Speaker 1: It's happening somewhere else.

272
00:17:56,568 --> 00:18:00,240
Speaker 1: unless you know where to look for it in your inside on it You would even never even know it's happening.

273
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:07,338
Speaker 0: So now the vanish cup like officials are trying to figure out who actually were like the griefers were.

274
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:07,860
Speaker 0: good luck.

275
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you?

276
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:16,180
Speaker 0: they're definitely behind seven proxies and they have to go work with the fortnight people to get any data.

277
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,427
Speaker 0: Yep Let's see, duh-duh-duh Extremely like setting everyone's excited.

278
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:30,259
Speaker 0: the impression I get though looking at like people talking about this is Other than some people who really cared about the tournament in the game people seem to find this more funny than annoying.

279
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,263
Speaker 1: Of course That's the point.

280
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:31,745
Speaker 1: really fun.

281
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:32,408
Speaker 1: That's the point.

282
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:33,151
Speaker 1: That's the news.

283
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:33,835
Speaker 0: Yep.

284
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,831
Speaker 0: I Like online tournaments even with controls.

285
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,344
Speaker 0: if the prize pool is low enough You're just gonna see.

286
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:43,230
Speaker 0: people call like stern shit up.

287
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,180
Speaker 1: and well sure but at least that's within the context of the tournament, right?

288
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,348
Speaker 1: I bring my wacky deck to the magic tournament.

289
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I just do stupid shit and lose every game.

290
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,669
Speaker 1: It's like, okay Well now you're eliminated right?

291
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,199
Speaker 1: Oh, you can't just go fucking with it.

292
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,791
Speaker 1: You know, you know, I guess the local game store you could go.

293
00:18:56,811 --> 00:19:01,404
Speaker 0: well, you can look at someone else's table Illustrates.

294
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:04,080
Speaker 1: no, you wouldn't be able to have a proper digital tournament.

295
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,956
Speaker 0: What if your shtick is just to be so annoying that the other player flips the table?

296
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:08,780
Speaker 0: or more importantly?

297
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:17,386
Speaker 0: This brings in a game theory thing because fortnight having more than two players and not being a race is Inherently political.

298
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:19,395
Speaker 0: it is capital P game theory.

299
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:20,219
Speaker 1: political it is.

300
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:29,027
Speaker 1: I mean I was talking generally about all games and not about the problems of any particular game because to talk about any particular game Yeah, we would go down a rabbit hole so deep.

301
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:32,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, right and that's why I will not have the discussion.

302
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:37,746
Speaker 0: Some other news Blizzard among other things Those Blizzcon it happened.

303
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:41,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, the usual the hot expected Hong Kong protest also happened.

304
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:48,071
Speaker 1: Yep at the start of Blizzcon They apologized without actually mentioning Hong Kong.

305
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:51,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't read the news about this, which I assume you have if you care?

306
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:54,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, right They won't unban the hearthstone guy.

307
00:19:55,061 --> 00:20:01,247
Speaker 0: He said they fucked up, but they won't unban the guy Because China is too important to Activision Blizzard.

308
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:18,460
Speaker 1: right and the tencent that company owns like six percent of black division blizzard for the first time a non-dude one The major eSports thing the great real exciting grand master of hearthstone does not have a penis which is kind of awesome.

309
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm actually really excited about that.

310
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:24,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's good, but Overwatch 2 is the news.

311
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:24,931
Speaker 0: that's really interesting.

312
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:36,450
Speaker 1: Diablo 4 they're making a Diablo to make a bunch of money yeah, and Oh hearthstone is getting like a movum like some kind of Auto chess mode, but it's hearthstone.

313
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:37,736
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck's up with that.

314
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:38,720
Speaker 1: I'm done with that.

315
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've not played an auto chess in a while

316
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:45,228
Speaker 1: But rim wants to talk about his overwatch - the most

317
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:51,619
Speaker 0: because what what overwatch - is is actually really interesting Because no one's quite sure

318
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:57,437
Speaker 1: Watch is a game where there are loot boxes you can buy but mostly you truly cosmetic don't do any right.

319
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,537
Speaker 1: mostly you just pay For it once and that's it.

320
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:11,280
Speaker 1: So in order to make more money from people who don't buy loot boxes They have to make like an like, you know The World of Warcraft model where there's expansions that they charge more or entirely new games that they charge money for now.

321
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,980
Speaker 0: No, because another way to make money off of it is it's the e-sport.

322
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:16,929
Speaker 1: How do you make money off the e-sport?

323
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,260
Speaker 0: with the advertising and the sponsorship, right?

324
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,535
Speaker 1: I'm saying to make money from the players unless they're buying Maybe the players other than that initial payment.

325
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:27,720
Speaker 0: They have to make to play the game.

326
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:30,020
Speaker 0: That's just to make sure there is a community.

327
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:33,258
Speaker 0: It's almost like making sure the minor leagues exist so you can have the major league.

328
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,469
Speaker 1: Sure Sure, but there's a strategy there.

329
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,820
Speaker 1: I find the point is they want to make money from the consumers.

330
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:41,675
Speaker 1: They had to make another overwatch or overwatch expansion and charge money for it.

331
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:47,194
Speaker 1: So they're making overwatch - well Yeah, cuz there's a little bit of money for overwatch - overwatch in general.

332
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:49,100
Speaker 1: Can you buy overwatch - without buying overwatch one?

333
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:58,174
Speaker 0: So overwatch in general has a - the problem it has is the problem that all Truly skill based competitive games that are serious have.

334
00:21:58,194 --> 00:21:59,600
Speaker 1: Even regardless of skill cap.

335
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:11,720
Speaker 0: Yep Most people suck at these games and get really mad when they continue to suck at them and the player base Falls off and you end up having like all the problems that all competitive games have had for all time.

336
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:15,376
Speaker 1: Well also competitive or not all games for all time have player.

337
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:28,226
Speaker 1: They start off big and people they players fall off over time Sometimes except counter-strike which somehow just continued to grow for a long long long long time Counter-strike strategy was.

338
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,551
Speaker 1: this is why I'm bringing this up.

339
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:32,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, they kept releasing more counter-strikes.

340
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,566
Speaker 1: And here you go overwatch is now released.

341
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,915
Speaker 1: This is basically CS source only overwatch source.

342
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:42,066
Speaker 0: Here's something else overwatch Many many of the people.

343
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,575
Speaker 0: this is now my opinion as opposed to like anything.

344
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:50,519
Speaker 0: an analyst has done detailed analysis On a lot of the people who like to play overwatch or we're into overwatch when it first came out.

345
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:55,218
Speaker 0: We're into it for a lot of reasons other than being super serious competitive.

346
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:55,580
Speaker 0: Of course.

347
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:57,807
Speaker 1: That's why there's arcade modes.

348
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,220
Speaker 1: That's why counter-strike has like no these other modes.

349
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,628
Speaker 0: They don't even like the arcade modes because they're still competitive.

350
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,016
Speaker 0: These are people just like casual modes.

351
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:08,520
Speaker 0: I know you Most of the arcade modes are still competitive.

352
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:12,253
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, like as in you're competing with other players, even if it's not ranked.

353
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,159
Speaker 0: Okay, people don't even like that.

354
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:24,959
Speaker 0: a lot of the people Seriously care about the character lore and the story and all this shit that is literally just there For like for the game to exist.

355
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:40,217
Speaker 0: but Those people are now not playing overwatch anymore because that's what they cared about and it seems like the thing that started to get those People to come back to overwatch was adding these entirely non-competitive purely cooperative PV emotes.

356
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:46,958
Speaker 0: Like people love those things Yeah And they want like cutscenes and leveling up characters and all that shit that I literally like.

357
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:49,146
Speaker 0: the thing It's completely different game.

358
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:53,160
Speaker 1: It just happens to be on the same engine the same platform the same piece of software.

359
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,600
Speaker 1: You just put lot, you know modes that are effectively completely different.

360
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:59,600
Speaker 1: They just use the same models or environments or whatever.

361
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,127
Speaker 0: But what's fascinating about this is that appeal to different.

362
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,735
Speaker 1: that way you can have a game that services everybody.

363
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:10,047
Speaker 1: the world of warcraft had PvP PvE You know do all kinds of stuff.

364
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,854
Speaker 1: It's neither ERP.

365
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:17,360
Speaker 1: Yeah go you can do on raids You can you know, you make lots and lots of different ways for people to play.

366
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,009
Speaker 1: You know, you have this one piece of software.

367
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:30,291
Speaker 1: you chart you've run on one platform Yeah and you just Make it so that it has so many different nets to catch so many different kinds of people because it's a lot cheaper than Making a different game for every different kind of person.

368
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:30,713
Speaker 0: Yep.

369
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:31,839
Speaker 0: So this gets back to remember.

370
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:38,580
Speaker 0: way back We talked about how fortnight had to make the game less competitive in order to keep the majority of their players.

371
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:42,660
Speaker 0: Yep, and they get like they completely gave up on the professional scene entire, right?

372
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,868
Speaker 1: That was what they had the rule in fortnight where killing people would get you loot So people would actually try to kill each other.

373
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then people didn't like that.

374
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:50,617
Speaker 1: So they got rid of it.

375
00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:02,858
Speaker 0: So What overwatch is basically doing now is overwatch - it seems like all the things that are actually Competitive in overwatch - we'll also make it back into overwatch.

376
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:22,713
Speaker 0: one like the new modes and everything and all overwatch - seems to be is a Player versus environment mode that can be single-player or co-op where you fucking level your character up like an action RPG or a loot shooter and Do like co-op missions to unlock story.

377
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:28,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, ah I mean that's not gonna have anything to do with like overwatch league.

378
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:28,570
Speaker 0: Nope.

379
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:31,679
Speaker 0: Oh, that's my only fear is that?

380
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:32,141
Speaker 1: no Kim There's.

381
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,400
Speaker 1: no you can't even have a league based around that game.

382
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:45,680
Speaker 0: My only fear is if PvE type mechanics not the leveling up or anything But like having mobs of like neutral things to fight and all that shit that I hate about mobas.

383
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:48,260
Speaker 0: That seems to be really popular the certain type of gamer.

384
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:48,764
Speaker 0: Well, there

385
00:25:48,784 --> 00:26:09,044
Speaker 1: have been a lot of attempts to make an FPS That's also a MOBA basically and they've been have that varying success But none of them have achieved the hugeness, you know in popularity of any FPS like Counter-Strike Yeah, any MOBA like Dota or LoL or you know any any Fortnight or any.

386
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:13,140
Speaker 1: you know, they've all been like, you know middle-ish games all the ones that trying to do that.

387
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:13,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

388
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:18,940
Speaker 1: So I don't know if that game genre is of doing that because you think like oh, you know.

389
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:35,968
Speaker 1: Actually making a MOBA as an FPS game instead of an RTS But having the same map the same idea of trying to capture the base the same hiding in the woods Yeah as long as you you'd have to because it's an FPS you would have to add more about the shooting skills and You would have to take out some of those item.

390
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:36,851
Speaker 1: crazy business.

391
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:37,594
Speaker 1: I probably should.

392
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:40,666
Speaker 1: you don't have to you look at like People love that item.

393
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:41,349
Speaker 0: bullshit though.

394
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:42,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, well pub G has it right?

395
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:47,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but You know, you couldn't make it any more complicated than pub G has.

396
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:54,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, right That could be a good game that I might even want to play maybe but no one's made one.

397
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,728
Speaker 1: That's really taken off and killed.

398
00:26:56,788 --> 00:27:00,562
Speaker 1: so I don't know if it the idea itself is not popular or if no one's just made a Good one yet.

399
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:00,823
Speaker 1: Yep.

400
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:08,080
Speaker 1: So based on it could they could make a good overwatch one if they you know They could or no one can and I feel they can't make one.

401
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,662
Speaker 1: No one can.

402
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:15,160
Speaker 0: this will be a test to see how far they can push that side of overwatch while still having competitive game.

403
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:35,659
Speaker 0: So it is best I can tell The kinds of people I don't play games with will all buy overwatch 2 and I will not because everything that's being added to overwatch 2 that I care about will also be an overwatch 1. overwatch 1 will basically be action quake weapons factories serious competitive asymmetric FPS game.

404
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,988
Speaker 1: They're not gonna add new characters and stuff and over.

405
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:41,700
Speaker 0: so you open an overwatch to watch to new characters and modes will also go.

406
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:43,725
Speaker 1: So there were basically.

407
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:46,676
Speaker 1: so overwatch 2 is literally not a new a different game.

408
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:47,720
Speaker 1: It's literally just modes.

409
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:50,393
Speaker 0: It seems like it's just the PvE mode.

410
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:55,114
Speaker 0: It seems like it's better graphics Slightly different art effectively.

411
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:55,980
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's actually better.

412
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,200
Speaker 0: So if you stick with overwatch 1 seems like I'll can you play again?

413
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,566
Speaker 1: So let's say I open over.

414
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:07,417
Speaker 1: yes same pool of if you play competitive mode same game But the game will just look worse as far as I can tell and you'll have everything else.

415
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:13,338
Speaker 0: Yep It seems like overwatch 2 is just get the people who care about it's like the only thing.

416
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:13,860
Speaker 0: you're fine.

417
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:15,796
Speaker 0: They want to know who is McCree fucking.

418
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:16,340
Speaker 0: is it Reaper?

419
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,240
Speaker 1: Is it may know the only thing you're buying when you buy over finding out who's fucking her and play our game modes?

420
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:24,993
Speaker 1: Well and and graphics improve game modes.

421
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:31,600
Speaker 0: that include all the stuff I hate about games like Borderlands coupled with all the lore and backstory stuff that I also don't care about.

422
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,163
Speaker 1: Okay, and you can watch on YouTube.

423
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:35,228
Speaker 0: Yes, which I probably will.

424
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:37,608
Speaker 1: so I Thought you didn't care about it.

425
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:42,709
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I'll watch it because those things are interesting But I'm not willing to play a game to find that stuff out.

426
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:51,690
Speaker 0: the thing I hate more than anything in a game is To click on things to get walls of text and backstory and lore like that is the least interesting.

427
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,697
Speaker 1: There probably won't be a while.

428
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,569
Speaker 1: It's extra probably like, you know cinematic stuff.

429
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,029
Speaker 0: Yep.

430
00:28:55,411 --> 00:29:01,673
Speaker 0: But it seems like one of the specific complaints the people who stopped playing overwatch one had is that the story was only from the Cinematics.

431
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:05,794
Speaker 0: they want the story to be in the game Half-life style.

432
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:07,539
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, which is weird.

433
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,442
Speaker 1: life is way back.

434
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:09,605
Speaker 1: Cinematics are garbage.

435
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,397
Speaker 1: I think if you're gonna make cinematics Why are you and making video games?

436
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,140
Speaker 1: go make movies?

437
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,668
Speaker 1: I've always said that.

438
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,542
Speaker 1: Yep So I think you have life too and have life.

439
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,029
Speaker 1: one were like a revelation in like.

440
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,922
Speaker 1: hey You're telling a story with your fucking video game.

441
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:23,750
Speaker 1: You're not like cutting away and showing a movie.

442
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:29,590
Speaker 0: Well except half-life 2 at many points locks you in a room with people talking at you for five minutes.

443
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,845
Speaker 1: Yes, but you can walk around and mess with stuff.

444
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:35,822
Speaker 1: Yeah It is a little bit hackneyed, but they still.

445
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:46,349
Speaker 1: well that game is also ancient Yes, but I mean the thing is at the time of half-life 1 there was no, you know Even though they lock you in a room also No other game did it that way?

446
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

447
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:47,293
Speaker 1: It was.

448
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:50,408
Speaker 1: it was no game and so half-life 2 is just doing a half like one did.

449
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:59,874
Speaker 0: so TLDL version of this overwatch 2 is probably a really smart move for Blizzard and it is not a game that I am in any Interested in playing.

450
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:04,530
Speaker 0: but I think it'll do well and I think it'll make more money.

451
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:08,470
Speaker 1: I mean remember about you know, how many counter-strike mods were something along those lines?

452
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:12,543
Speaker 0: You know, well all the people who would play that Wow mod of counter-strike.

453
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:14,070
Speaker 0: That was literally just garbage.

454
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was garbage.

455
00:30:15,478 --> 00:30:21,030
Speaker 0: You could level up over time Persistently and it was the Skinner box of level and shit.

456
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:22,378
Speaker 1: I think you can talk.

457
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:29,777
Speaker 1: we have talked since the beginning of time About how you know people would rather Improve a digital character with a Skinner box.

458
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:33,547
Speaker 1: that makes them feel like they're improving rather than actually improve their own human body.

459
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:43,240
Speaker 0: But anyway It's time for things of the day.

460
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:52,874
Speaker 0: So I'm actually a pretty big fan of horror fiction in general and I actually do really like creepypastas Yeah, and that kind of stuff, but this is pretty cool.

461
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,430
Speaker 1: This is a Pac-man, I like Pac-man.

462
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:57,395
Speaker 0: It's a ROM you can play.

463
00:30:57,415 --> 00:31:01,550
Speaker 1: it's a real game Okay, but the game doesn't look like a legit pac-man to me.

464
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,800
Speaker 0: Well, cuz it's basically if pac-man were a creepypasta.

465
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,289
Speaker 0: It's like a horror version of pac-man.

466
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:08,212
Speaker 1: Pac-man's already a horror.

467
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:09,316
Speaker 1: There's ghosts chasing him.

468
00:31:09,477 --> 00:31:10,260
Speaker 1: These are ways.

469
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,288
Speaker 0: These are way scarier ghosts Jerry.

470
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:14,216
Speaker 1: What's scarier than fucking Clyde coming up?

471
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:14,918
Speaker 1: Like, what's up?

472
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:16,767
Speaker 0: You know what?

473
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,540
Speaker 0: you already used all four power pills.

474
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,273
Speaker 1: So instead yeah, I'm gonna block you from getting that pretzel.

475
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:33,540
Speaker 0: instead of making a creepypasta That's just a wall of text of someone found a cursed cartridge of Super Mario World where Luigi's dead And you have to figure out the mystery and then you died in real life.

476
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,385
Speaker 0: It is just a ROM.

477
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:41,284
Speaker 0: that is a game you can play and that game you can play is a legit good Pac-man game.

478
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,432
Speaker 0: that is also a scary horror game.

479
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:50,185
Speaker 1: So instead of making a creepypasta Story they actually made the game from the creepypasta Environmental storytelling.

480
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:57,159
Speaker 0: the game itself is the scary story and it's also a game you can play And it's a cool mechanic where pac-man can only see what pac-man can fucking see.

481
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,687
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like it looks it looks fun.

482
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:00,972
Speaker 0: Like it looks like it's worth plan.

483
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:03,582
Speaker 1: All right, it's just map memorization I think.

484
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:07,960
Speaker 0: well also you got to figure out because all the ghosts are crazy different and scary and do different things.

485
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:09,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's just gonna kill you.

486
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:10,311
Speaker 0: It looks way fun.

487
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:11,999
Speaker 1: It doesn't look as fun as pac-man CEDX.

488
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:15,780
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, but pac-man CEDX is way more fun than the sequel.

489
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,740
Speaker 1: Sequel I think it just is a different way of thinking that doesn't match most human brains.

490
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I'm not continuing to play.

491
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:27,126
Speaker 0: Anyway, what do you got?

492
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,250
Speaker 1: What was my thing of the day?

493
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:28,993
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

494
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there was this Christian rock band.

495
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:33,786
Speaker 1: What's the name of the band?

496
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:36,755
Speaker 1: skip around the video so I can remember prodigal prodigal.

497
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:38,340
Speaker 0: I fucking know prodigal.

498
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,946
Speaker 1: Anyway, oh my god.

499
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,050
Speaker 1: Okay sing a prodigal song.

500
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:43,400
Speaker 1: Uh, no, I just I've heard no prodigal song.

501
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:45,431
Speaker 0: I know, you know where I know prodigal from.

502
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:55,180
Speaker 0: in high school There was this one really annoying dude who was really into Christian rock And he brought up prodigal all the side all the time.

503
00:32:55,662 --> 00:33:05,320
Speaker 0: and when we made this like we made this project for a class once in like French class and he Insisted on putting this specific prodigal song into our project anyway.

504
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:09,391
Speaker 1: So this Christian rock band rim claims to know named prodigal.

505
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:28,480
Speaker 1: they put out a vinyl album way back in the 80s I'm pretty sure was 80s and 1984. they knew about computers I guess somehow and they hired some dude at some computer place in Florida to write them a Commodore 64 Program that would display like a quote from Albert Einstein and a quote from Jesus.

506
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:34,318
Speaker 1: It was a really simple basic program like really short and it would just display these two quotes on the screen.

507
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:34,780
Speaker 1: and that was it.

508
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:36,766
Speaker 1: And if you don't know right?

509
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:40,217
Speaker 1: you back in those days in the early 80s, right?

510
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,326
Speaker 1: Especially in other countries in the u.s.

511
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:58,639
Speaker 1: The Commodore 64 and other computers, you know, we mostly went with floppy disks and cartridges And we didn't need to use cassette tapes, you know Some computers did but we sort of got past that whereas other other countries especially UK had a lot more cassette tape.

512
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:06,900
Speaker 1: Game just you know got game software distribution going on right where you basically encode the bits which is just as an analog signal.

513
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,416
Speaker 1: Yep, right, but the signal isn't like quadratic amplitude modulation.

514
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:12,620
Speaker 1: played the cassette tape.

515
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:15,060
Speaker 1: It sounded like how your modem sounds right?

516
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:21,050
Speaker 1: It's zeros and ones just in an analog signal and if you look at the analog signal on your oscilloscope It's like I'll look zeros and ones.

517
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,331
Speaker 1: right.

518
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:21,916
Speaker 1: there they are.

519
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,931
Speaker 1: And in fact, I'm like my apple 2gs.

520
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:31,400
Speaker 1: I have a trick I can do where You take pretty much anything that plays audio for example your phone, right?

521
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:47,975
Speaker 1: You take the headphone cable you plug it in the back of the Apple - right you go online Like a website and you can go on YouTube and you find like a video that has Software in the audio and just play the YouTube video real loud out your phone and into the Apple - and lo and behold You'll run the piece up, right?

522
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:48,359
Speaker 1: It works.

523
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:54,300
Speaker 1: You could just distribute Apple - software on YouTube or any or SoundCloud or whatever the fright.

524
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:07,160
Speaker 1: So here what they did is on prodigal's vinyl album on a hidden track in like the inside cuz in the middle of every vinyl There's like a runoff area where the needle goes to spin around forever after the out records done.

525
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:09,253
Speaker 1: So it doesn't go like into the middle of the.

526
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:10,058
Speaker 0: yeah, right?

527
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:18,152
Speaker 1: And some most record players had a thing that auto detected when the needle hit the runoff and would reset the needle back to the start.

528
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,680
Speaker 1: so you had to disable that in order to.

529
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 1: If you had it not every record player had it but if your turntable had that you have to disable it so that the needle can go inside the runoff track.

530
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,590
Speaker 1: and There was a Commodore 64 program right there.

531
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:42,616
Speaker 1: So in this video, that is my thing of the day This guy shows the whole process of getting that, you know programs are run on a real Commodore 64.

532
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:51,928
Speaker 1: He I guess this person Honorably, but also stupidly takes the audio from the vinyl to a cassette to the Commodore.

533
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:57,870
Speaker 1: I'm like, bro Why don't you just make a digital recording and then play it from your computer into the Commodore?

534
00:35:58,071 --> 00:36:00,062
Speaker 1: Why did you use the in-between of the cassette?

535
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:01,470
Speaker 1: That was obviously a pain in the ass.

536
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,570
Speaker 1: I get the authentic thing, but you could have saved a lot of hassle.

537
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:11,989
Speaker 1: Yeah Just going from vinyl to wave then from computer to come feels very much like the audio and like record.

538
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:17,830
Speaker 1: I old you to take an audio cable from your computer sound card into the input on the Commodore.

539
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:22,628
Speaker 1: You don't need to do the cassette tape thing But it works pretty awesome.

540
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:27,807
Speaker 0: So, yeah, yeah in the meta moment the game guys book club book will take a while.

541
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:28,610
Speaker 0: it's the tale of Genji.

542
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,159
Speaker 0: We're gonna do some checkpoint episodes along.

543
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:32,403
Speaker 1: It's a big-ass book.

544
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:34,049
Speaker 1: So we're gonna have some kind of strategy.

545
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:35,194
Speaker 0: I'm into it though.

546
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,660
Speaker 1: Genji's kind of a dick.

547
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,483
Speaker 1: That's the point.

548
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:42,849
Speaker 0: like Genji He sucks, but I feel like he might get better.

549
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,340
Speaker 0: Well, or maybe he won't.

550
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:47,150
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if he's gonna get better or not.

551
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:49,829
Speaker 1: You'll see all of Genji's life.

552
00:36:53,332 --> 00:36:58,229
Speaker 0: I mean the katamani crystal went through a pretty good evolution, but I feel like a lot more is gonna happen here.

553
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:15,268
Speaker 0: Yeah Otherwise, we're gonna be live at packs unplugged in December then at mag fest in January right after New Year's then at Probably pack south and then right after that packs east and then not too long after that packs west again.

554
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:17,883
Speaker 1: life never Quite a while after that few months.

555
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:23,788
Speaker 0: Yeah before you know it all tickets are on sale for unplugged south and east.

556
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,737
Speaker 1: East actually only sat.

557
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:28,606
Speaker 1: east went on sale like I think a while ago.

558
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:40,449
Speaker 0: Yep May a couple weeks the not even Saturday is sold out but four days or not which Confirms something I've sort of suspected for a long time because double-check all the good hotels are completely sold out.

559
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:51,856
Speaker 0: so a Four-day badge is kind of worthless to most people because if you're not staying in a hotel next to the convention center Really sucks to go to packs More than one day.

560
00:37:51,876 --> 00:38:00,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, right like if you live in say I don't know, Maine Right, you could wake up early drive to Boston pay for an expensive parking spot.

561
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:04,430
Speaker 1: Right go to packs all day even on Friday or Sunday or Thursday.

562
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:10,669
Speaker 1: Right, even if it's not Saturday, you got a full packs day get in your car drive home to Maine late at night, right?

563
00:38:12,272 --> 00:38:15,143
Speaker 1: State New York, you could take 84 across right?

564
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:17,190
Speaker 0: That's how I used to go to like uber con and all those kinds.

565
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,698
Speaker 1: Jersey you can get to Boston right?

566
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:22,645
Speaker 1: I guess, you know DC might be a little far.

567
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:23,990
Speaker 1: you could take to a cellar trains.

568
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, man, also just there's a ton of people that live nearby that just want to go for a day.

569
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:34,094
Speaker 1: but if you have nowhere to stay any more than one day is Right, even worse.

570
00:38:34,756 --> 00:38:38,068
Speaker 0: There are still hotels, but they're the ones that are way over by the hinds.

571
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:43,104
Speaker 1: You got to use those If you stay in a faraway hotel and use a shuttle bus never for a day.

572
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:45,110
Speaker 1: That's not a great pack experience.

573
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:53,495
Speaker 0: Also, it's interesting to watch how packs East other than like tabletop fucking clears out at dinnertime For all the reasons.

574
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:54,500
Speaker 0: we've talked about pecs East.

575
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,910
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't hurt that the you know, the area It's not like if it was say in the hinds, of course, the building is a problem.

576
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:07,090
Speaker 1: But location you could go out immediately across the street eat on Newberry Street and walk right back into packs.

577
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:09,417
Speaker 1: Right same thing in you know in Seattle.

578
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:13,650
Speaker 1: It's like okay expo hall closed walk outside eat dinner.

579
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:15,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, go back in.

580
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:16,590
Speaker 1: I'm still right near packs.

581
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:21,370
Speaker 1: If you want to eat, it's like you gotta go far away waiting along the line by the time you're done eating.

582
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:22,816
Speaker 1: You're already far away.

583
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:24,563
Speaker 0: You'd rain because of the security.

584
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,270
Speaker 0: it takes forever to get back into packs, right?

585
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know late at night There's not gonna be late at night.

586
00:39:28,897 --> 00:39:31,310
Speaker 0: everyone who saw this right in the morning and they just bailed.

587
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the security is just walk in late at night.

588
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:42,234
Speaker 1: but the point is To go back to packs versus go back to your hotel when after you've eaten dinner and left the expo hall is a kind of Hassle.

589
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:43,219
Speaker 1: you can just go.

590
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,190
Speaker 1: you rather just go back to your hotel room and sleep at that.

591
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:56,890
Speaker 0: Yeah There's also the thing that most people who want to go to any kind of nerd convention now like there's a set of people who want to go for the Whole weekend and make it a weekend long nerd experience which like us a lot like anime cons.

592
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,598
Speaker 0: Most people go to anime cons do that.

593
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,190
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah most like tabletop cons Like.

594
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:02,656
Speaker 0: that's what people want to do mag fest.

595
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:05,026
Speaker 0: not many people go to mag fest for one day.

596
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:08,583
Speaker 1: No They should just actually sell only full badges.

597
00:40:08,603 --> 00:40:14,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Paxes and Comic cons that have big expo halls.

598
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:21,996
Speaker 0: the number of people who want to go to these things just to see that expo hall is probably more than the number of people Who want to actually go to see the whole con.

599
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:26,470
Speaker 0: and this continual like pull between these two groups with very different?

600
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,290
Speaker 0: Desires from the conventions is continuing to be a problem and there's no good solution.

601
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,424
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the solution is I just have two different events.

602
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:43,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, or Let's say packs unplugged at the expo hall is like, all right, even if you go there for it You're not gonna be doing too much there because it's you know, it's tabletop, right?

603
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,449
Speaker 1: Yeah big on tabletop That's your main thing.

604
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,899
Speaker 1: The expo hall won't occupy you for that much time.

605
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,942
Speaker 1: Even Gen Con won't.

606
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:52,629
Speaker 1: it's like you're gonna spend your time playing games, right?

607
00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:00,102
Speaker 1: If you're there for video games, then you might not spend your time playing games that are real packs Yep, and that's why you just go to expo and leave.

608
00:41:00,464 --> 00:41:04,870
Speaker 0: This is why packs unplugged Increasingly other than pecs West cuz it's back to West.

609
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:06,858
Speaker 1: It's my favorite back.

610
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,066
Speaker 1: If only it wasn't in Philly.

611
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:12,110
Speaker 0: I know If it was anywhere, but Philly, I'd be a lot happier anyway.

612
00:41:13,111 --> 00:41:14,805
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's get right into it.

613
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:16,834
Speaker 1: Untitled goose game.

614
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:20,182
Speaker 1: speaking of packs packs 2018, right?

615
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:23,450
Speaker 1: We're in this packs and suddenly everyone's going wild about this fucking goose game.

616
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,455
Speaker 1: We're like, what the hell is this?

617
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,270
Speaker 1: and we find out there's a game and they got a big-ass booth.

618
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:33,482
Speaker 1: the booth is there again this year in 2019 and Made by these developers that were sort of newish on the scene.

619
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:35,469
Speaker 1: house house or sorry is house house.

620
00:41:36,712 --> 00:41:39,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the game is called untitled goose game.

621
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,950
Speaker 1: The game doesn't have a title, right?

622
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,366
Speaker 1: It's just you call it the untitled goose game because that's the way you refer to the game.

623
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:46,520
Speaker 1: that has no title But it is a game with no title.

624
00:41:46,681 --> 00:41:53,280
Speaker 1: That is a goose game And it's a game where you are a goose 3d walk around real-time video.

625
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:56,569
Speaker 0: No, you are specifically a Horrible goose.

626
00:41:56,714 --> 00:42:03,670
Speaker 1: Yes Here's horrible goose and you go around like honking flapping your wings and making people miserable stealing shit.

627
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:04,295
Speaker 1: No, any.

628
00:42:04,597 --> 00:42:06,853
Speaker 1: and so that concept alone It's all we saw.

629
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:10,730
Speaker 1: all I saw of it was that and I was like that's a genius idea for a game.

630
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,735
Speaker 1: There's no game like it.

631
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:13,063
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy that and play it.

632
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,008
Speaker 1: That's gonna be a thing.

633
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:15,720
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, I could tell already it's it.

634
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:19,338
Speaker 1: as soon as they showed it at packs It was a thing and I'm like that's gonna be a thing.

635
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,446
Speaker 1: and just like a week ago.

636
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:24,820
Speaker 1: Maybe it came out For a while as it.

637
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,623
Speaker 1: how long's it been out?

638
00:42:25,684 --> 00:42:26,045
Speaker 0: a while?

639
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,130
Speaker 0: you just didn't play now.

640
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,018
Speaker 1: When did it actually came out recently?

641
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,124
Speaker 0: I mean we've been.

642
00:42:30,445 --> 00:42:31,510
Speaker 0: I play beat it a while ago.

643
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,393
Speaker 0: I even tweeted about it.

644
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:33,938
Speaker 1: wasn't as long ago as you think.

645
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,985
Speaker 1: this game came out super recently.

646
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:37,470
Speaker 0: it came out in September.

647
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,033
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

648
00:42:38,174 --> 00:42:39,280
Speaker 0: Okay, Scott.

649
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:40,065
Speaker 0: Come on.

650
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:43,918
Speaker 0: Well, I beat it Moldels every Tuesday show.

651
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:46,170
Speaker 0: I was like, did you play the goose game yet so we can do a show on it?

652
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,973
Speaker 0: You kept saying no.

653
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:49,482
Speaker 0: Well, I'd have the record and this I was beating.

654
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,810
Speaker 0: I beat like this awakening again.

655
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,894
Speaker 0: We'll probably talk about.

656
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:54,220
Speaker 1: you had never played to begin with.

657
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm almost done.

658
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:56,510
Speaker 1: I'm playing it.

659
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:58,100
Speaker 0: I got a whole bunch of instruments.

660
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:02,236
Speaker 0: I just got the mirror shield and I've never played it before.

661
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,722
Speaker 0: but I don't fucking trust that owl at all.

662
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:05,570
Speaker 0: But all this bad fucking news.

663
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:07,519
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's the same alpha lay the Zelda game.

664
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:15,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't trust this owl anyway, so Yeah, so then I played this and like people said goose game is hella short.

665
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:16,370
Speaker 1: it is.

666
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:20,209
Speaker 1: It's the right length like right length for an adult who's got better shit to do.

667
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,710
Speaker 0: But it's also the right length as in it is it like the game is brilliant.

668
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:38,750
Speaker 0: but the reason I say it's brilliant is that the thing that I'm most focused on in game design is always this concept of elegance and fun economy In the sense that a four-hour game that's a fun for four hours is not as good as a one-hour game.

669
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,789
Speaker 0: That's really fun for that one hour.

670
00:43:41,043 --> 00:43:42,981
Speaker 1: Yeah I think I think that's what the thing is is like.

671
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:53,478
Speaker 1: on the one hand if you were expecting More 70 hours of goose right if you're spending more goose and you're set because it is super short It's like four areas.

672
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,643
Speaker 1: Maybe it's basically.

673
00:43:54,663 --> 00:44:04,830
Speaker 0: there's the game which You know the the other concept we kind of get into in games that allows the idea of if you have a simple set of Mechanics, do you fully explore those mechanics?

674
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:14,684
Speaker 0: So the goose game is a very simple set of mechanics and in the first half of the game like the real game until you Quote-unquote beat it and get the ending which I won't spoil because I laughed so hard.

675
00:44:14,704 --> 00:44:15,427
Speaker 0: I almost choked.

676
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:16,994
Speaker 1: the ending was so perfect Wasn't that funny?

677
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:18,183
Speaker 0: I thought it was really funny.

678
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:30,810
Speaker 0: Okay, but the the very simple mechanics that has are Fully explored and then you beat it and then if that wasn't enough it like Legend of Zelda 1. there's a second quest.

679
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:31,877
Speaker 0: That's just more.

680
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:36,519
Speaker 0: if you really want to challenge it You can do the same thing again slightly harder slightly different.

681
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,028
Speaker 0: a few of the parts of the second quest are way harder.

682
00:44:39,048 --> 00:44:44,623
Speaker 1: Yeah So yeah, it's you know, you walk around you can flap.

683
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:45,224
Speaker 0: Yeah.

684
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:48,455
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you can walk you can run You can walk run.

685
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:50,763
Speaker 1: You can crouch your head down low to the ground up.

686
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,590
Speaker 1: You can grab your wing.

687
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,402
Speaker 1: You got wings up your wings and you can honk and you can.

688
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,406
Speaker 1: you know what you?

689
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:01,190
Speaker 1: it's not just grab It's you can interact with anything that has like these action lines.

690
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,929
Speaker 1: So most of the time you put your head near something and has action lines to grab it.

691
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:18,064
Speaker 1: But there's other things you can interact with like, you know, ring a bell Push a button knock something over Trim a hedge, you know, very basically push a to interact with an interactable item.

692
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:22,441
Speaker 0: Yep, and there's a. There's a lot of items to interact with.

693
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:24,350
Speaker 0: most of them are not strictly necessary.

694
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:28,321
Speaker 0: Like if you want to speedrun this game You can skip most of the things you could.

695
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:34,670
Speaker 1: you're gonna see speedruns of this game at like, you know A GDQ event and it's probably gonna take minutes like single-digit minutes.

696
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:41,915
Speaker 0: I've watched some speedruns and of this already and the funniest part was one dude was doing this pretty fast speedrun and Literally in the middle of the run.

697
00:45:41,935 --> 00:45:44,467
Speaker 0: He's like, oh wait, I think I can route this way better.

698
00:45:44,527 --> 00:45:45,893
Speaker 0: He's like fuck it I'm starting over.

699
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,518
Speaker 0: I think I can set the world record right now.

700
00:45:47,538 --> 00:45:48,020
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

701
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:50,408
Speaker 0: Cuz the world record is evolving rapidly.

702
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:59,430
Speaker 1: Yes But you know the fun of the game is that you know You walk around and you interact with all the things that goose can interact with and it's funny.

703
00:46:00,072 --> 00:46:03,902
Speaker 0: It's subtle and understated and it trusts the player to get the joke.

704
00:46:04,023 --> 00:46:05,206
Speaker 0: because literally the game.

705
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:15,890
Speaker 0: after you get into the first area You see this farmer and then suddenly this little notebook appears with your agenda for the day And it's some of them are very straightforward like steal the farmers keys

706
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:19,890
Speaker 1: So you walk you sneak up behind the farmer grab his keys and run and that that's it.

707
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,322
Speaker 0: Some of them are more vague like just well not vague really but more funny.

708
00:46:23,342 --> 00:46:24,767
Speaker 0: Like one is just raking the lake.

709
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:36,390
Speaker 1: Yep It's pretty straightforward Yeah But some of them are not straightforward and you have to figure out Which items to interact with in which order with which timing in order to make the thing happen.

710
00:46:36,653 --> 00:46:39,896
Speaker 0: But along the way like the list itself is a joke.

711
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:48,906
Speaker 0: and then when you play the game like as you figure out like some of the puzzles when You figure out how to solve them the way they are solved is itself funny.

712
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:50,512
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm they like.

713
00:46:50,552 --> 00:47:00,910
Speaker 0: the game is just really really good subtle clever comedy as An interactive entertainment software that lets you explore the comedy on your own terms on your own time, right?

714
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:08,270
Speaker 1: I think what it really is this game is it's basically a point-and-click adventure game in disguise plus a real-time element.

715
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:18,785
Speaker 0: Yep, right so you say well with the quest for glory piece meaning for any given task There are a lot of different ways to accomplish it usually not too much.

716
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:22,138
Speaker 1: some subtly Yes, kinda no.

717
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:22,741
Speaker 0: some of them.

718
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:24,568
Speaker 0: there are like eight or nine different ways to solve it.

719
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:28,552
Speaker 0: some of them There's only like one or two but many of the things you have to do I think it's like.

720
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:35,716
Speaker 1: it's like that the the basic structure of how to accomplish any given thing is Basically always the same.

721
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:40,650
Speaker 1: It's just the details of your specific execution can vary, right?

722
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:45,070
Speaker 1: So like rake in the lake, it's like, okay, you have to grab the rake and run to the lake.

723
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:52,504
Speaker 1: But maybe you know, I might do it in a way where I sneakily Sneak around with the rake and don't get spotted.

724
00:47:52,545 --> 00:47:55,373
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm just like fucking Go go go.

725
00:47:55,754 --> 00:48:00,490
Speaker 1: Maybe I just brute force it and run right so fast that I'm not caught, right?

726
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,582
Speaker 1: And maybe I have to drop the rake a few times.

727
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:03,710
Speaker 1: then they go back for it.

728
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I grab some other.

729
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,450
Speaker 1: I grab the rake I get caught.

730
00:48:07,712 --> 00:48:09,045
Speaker 1: So then I grab something else.

731
00:48:09,106 --> 00:48:12,619
Speaker 1: the farmer Prioritizes that something else more than the rake.

732
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,485
Speaker 1: so I distract the farmer with something else.

733
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:24,190
Speaker 1: they go back for the rake before Dealing with like his spade or something, right and it's like yeah The fundamental way to get the rake in the lake is you grab it and you have to carry it to the lake.

734
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,510
Speaker 1: There's no other way to do it.

735
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:32,472
Speaker 1: Like another one of the details of how you succeed at dragging it all the way to the lake might vary Like.

736
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:36,390
Speaker 0: there's one where you basically tells you get this lady trapped in her garage.

737
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of ways to get her into that garage and trapper like a lot of different ways.

738
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:47,161
Speaker 1: Well, it's like you have to open the garage and then you have to wait for her to be in the garage And once she's in the garage, you have to pull the rope.

739
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:48,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I didn't get her into the garage, right?

740
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,159
Speaker 1: Well, there's pretty much any way to get this.

741
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,970
Speaker 1: so many different ways to get her attention in the garage.

742
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:55,155
Speaker 0: So here's the other cleverness.

743
00:48:55,195 --> 00:49:00,714
Speaker 0: the mechanic of the game like the way the humans work is really clever in that The humans have like different.

744
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:02,159
Speaker 0: humans have different levels of aggression.

745
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,994
Speaker 0: meaning if you the goose enter a certain human space They just kind of look at you.

746
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:07,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the kid like the kid.

747
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:08,970
Speaker 1: He doesn't really care too much about you.

748
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:09,793
Speaker 1: Let's attack him.

749
00:49:09,853 --> 00:49:10,696
Speaker 1: It's kind of scared of you.

750
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:14,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like the farmer just kind of looks at you unless you fuck with him.

751
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:19,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like the guy at the pub like actively assaults you if you get.

752
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:21,638
Speaker 1: no, yeah The bouncer at the pub is the strongest dude.

753
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:23,427
Speaker 1: It's like he doesn't let you in the pub.

754
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:25,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's sort of an.

755
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:29,444
Speaker 1: it's slightly annoying in one sense because you know the the.

756
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:32,314
Speaker 1: it's like yeah humans can like make you drop But you're holding.

757
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:33,442
Speaker 1: they can take things from you.

758
00:49:33,462 --> 00:49:34,470
Speaker 1: They can push you around.

759
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:36,016
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can do about it.

760
00:49:36,157 --> 00:49:37,021
Speaker 1: And I'm like, wait a minute.

761
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:41,287
Speaker 1: First of all geese can fucking fly Right as you will just fly to.

762
00:49:41,307 --> 00:49:44,737
Speaker 0: uh Geese have a hard time taking off unless they're in water.

763
00:49:45,439 --> 00:49:45,760
Speaker 1: That's good.

764
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,442
Speaker 1: That's news to me.

765
00:49:46,603 --> 00:49:53,072
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is - geese can shit Right.

766
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:55,904
Speaker 0: Oh, that should have been another option to get on lock shitting.

767
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:57,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, she could shit on people.

768
00:49:58,431 --> 00:50:00,781
Speaker 0: Take it away from the like benign charm of the game.

769
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:01,002
Speaker 0: I'm not.

770
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:02,710
Speaker 1: I'm not saying the game should have done these things.

771
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:10,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just saying in the fiction I was constantly annoyed by humans us not constantly but slightly annoyed at humans being able to push me around.

772
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:12,250
Speaker 1: I'm just like it doesn't make sense.

773
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,640
Speaker 1: I just bite that fucker as like if a goose.

774
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,419
Speaker 1: even if you're a bouncer at a club if a goose comes up and is All biting and flapping at you.

775
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:25,050
Speaker 0: You're not pushing it around If you're if you're willing to harm the goose, it's trivial to stop a goose.

776
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,842
Speaker 0: But most people are attacked by geese don't want to hurt the goose.

777
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:29,510
Speaker 0: They just want the goose to stop biting them, right?

778
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,150
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like no human would behave the way these humans do and the goose.

779
00:50:33,271 --> 00:50:39,503
Speaker 1: I was worried but a real goose Could if it desired be much more vicious than this goose is.

780
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:43,700
Speaker 1: this goose is such a for being in such a jerky goose That fucks with people.

781
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:45,150
Speaker 1: It's such a nice goose.

782
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:49,670
Speaker 1: It doesn't fucking bite people and poke them and whap flap them and fly in and poop on them.

783
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,510
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, they just like go rake in the leg.

784
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:58,050
Speaker 1: It's like Jesus Christ, but you know The farmer shouldn't be able to stop the goose unless it's an evil farmer to shoot the goose.

785
00:50:58,412 --> 00:51:00,790
Speaker 0: But the other why is it goes dropping that rake?

786
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:14,470
Speaker 0: The other cool thing about the way the humans work is that they basically they all have like things they do and over their heads It'll always float an icon of like the thing they wish to interact with Mm-hmm, and they kind of go about their thing.

787
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,710
Speaker 0: You can watch them and sort of time thing to solve puzzles.

788
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:24,730
Speaker 0: But they also if they see the goose with anything, they'll be like goose shouldn't have that thing.

789
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,627
Speaker 0: They'll come take it from you.

790
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:32,610
Speaker 0: They also if you take something that they then later want to interact with they'll start roaming around the map looking for it

791
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:35,526
Speaker 1: Right and they seem to have a priority of things that are most important

792
00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:40,127
Speaker 0: like that old man If I take his stool like fucking he will get that stool back before he'll go after other stuff.

793
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:40,930
Speaker 0: I stall right.

794
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:41,654
Speaker 1: It's like they care.

795
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:44,230
Speaker 1: each human cares more about certain items than others.

796
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:57,370
Speaker 1: So it's like you might steal an item that they don't care about too much and they won't go looking for event, you know for a long time, but It like if you steal ten things you can readily predict which the order in which they'll get the ten.

797
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's back.

798
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:02,234
Speaker 0: You can also softlock like when Natalie was playing at her house I didn't have that she won't know.

799
00:52:02,275 --> 00:52:07,510
Speaker 0: she permanently trapped the farmer in a spot where he could never leave and never correct himself.

800
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:08,929
Speaker 1: No I didn't mean so.

801
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:15,269
Speaker 0: She walked up to him later like took his keys and just like walk back and forth past him because he could not get out Of the thing she trapped him in it.

802
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:20,496
Speaker 0: It was permanently there interesting and at the end of the game when you go all the way back through the world He was still trapped.

803
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:20,718
Speaker 1: Yeah

804
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:27,888
Speaker 0: The another part of the humor is that some of the things you interact with

805
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:27,969
Speaker 1: are

806
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:38,749
Speaker 0: Basically just little set pieces that are really funny along the way like there's one moment where you get into someone's house But the camera doesn't actually show you what's happening in the house.

807
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:54,110
Speaker 0: you just see like some wing flaps through the windows and you hear a bunch of noises and crashes and like Eventually you get shoved out the front door on the other side and it's like it's really funny and it's almost just like an Interstitial before you get to the next part of the game, right?

808
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,064
Speaker 1: I think that's really you know, it's like that's.

809
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,689
Speaker 1: you know the game's like.

810
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:01,525
Speaker 1: You know greatness is like all this polish that has gone into the.

811
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:06,248
Speaker 1: you know the environment and you know the things and they write and all that.

812
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:16,979
Speaker 1: and I think if this game didn't have the theme of being a goose Right if this is literally any other thing like just a dude walking around This would be a garbage game.

813
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:17,281
Speaker 1: Yep.

814
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:18,468
Speaker 1: It would be completely worthless.

815
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:20,412
Speaker 0: We're hard.

816
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:21,014
Speaker 0: It would just.

817
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:26,749
Speaker 1: it would literally just be like if you you know, like say monkey island only real time.

818
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:29,690
Speaker 1: But imagine if you took away all the funny monkey island biz.

819
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:30,011
Speaker 1: It was.

820
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:34,687
Speaker 1: it's just literally figure out which things to interact with in which order with which timing.

821
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:35,730
Speaker 1: it's the saw.

822
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,398
Speaker 1: It's just an answer but also and it.

823
00:53:38,438 --> 00:53:44,015
Speaker 0: sometimes it would be actually kind of frustrating also if the quests were harder It wouldn't have been as fun.

824
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:46,483
Speaker 1: Yeah harder would have been like even more.

825
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:51,590
Speaker 0: there's already a slight amount of frustration But it's the right amount like a few of those pretty hard.

826
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:52,111
Speaker 1: It is.

827
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:59,030
Speaker 1: the amount of frustration isn't the problem, but it's occasionally the kind of frustration is that sort of escape room?

828
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,498
Speaker 1: You know point-and-click adventure game stuff.

829
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:02,341
Speaker 0: I never ran into that.

830
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:04,530
Speaker 0: My question was never how do I accomplish this?

831
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:08,629
Speaker 0: My question was always Like how do I get around this obstacle in my way of?

832
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,232
Speaker 0: Accomplishing the thing that I know I want to do like I got to trick this guy out of the way or something Hmm.

833
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:18,314
Speaker 0: The only one I had trouble with was for some reason I had troubles getting the guy to fall on his ass Like I could well Frank.

834
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:20,444
Speaker 1: for example, there was one where I get a candle.

835
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:21,810
Speaker 1: I looked all the fuck over.

836
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:22,950
Speaker 1: I didn't see any fucking candle.

837
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:26,961
Speaker 1: No, I didn't go over in that where it was.

838
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:28,870
Speaker 0: I went everywhere cuz I just wanted to poke at the world.

839
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:29,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I did.

840
00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:31,722
Speaker 1: it took me forever to find that fucking candle.

841
00:54:31,742 --> 00:54:33,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like it wasn't hard.

842
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,997
Speaker 1: It was just I didn't see it over there, right?

843
00:54:36,017 --> 00:54:36,860
Speaker 0: And there's one of my favorite.

844
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,665
Speaker 1: There's another thing that looked candle.

845
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:39,849
Speaker 1: ish, right?

846
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:43,149
Speaker 0: I think my favorite area is still the two gardens.

847
00:54:44,242 --> 00:54:52,510
Speaker 1: Yeah The area that has the most going on and that tells the most story and tells the human story of the two neighbors.

848
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:53,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's.

849
00:54:53,731 --> 00:55:04,630
Speaker 0: that's what makes it better the little bits like you see the lady like spying on the dude when he's not looking And all the stuff going on between the two of them is really fine And then whatever.

850
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:08,103
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's it's you know, I think it's like.

851
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:11,616
Speaker 1: on the one hand It's like the game on its own.

852
00:55:11,736 --> 00:55:20,404
Speaker 1: just the game part of it on its own with known to the goose part and the theme Part right is basically a game that I probably wouldn't even like.

853
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:20,765
Speaker 1: hate it.

854
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:22,290
Speaker 1: Like this is garbage, right?

855
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,977
Speaker 1: It's just what it shows how important.

856
00:55:24,338 --> 00:55:26,970
Speaker 0: polish style theme humor.

857
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:36,988
Speaker 1: It's literally just a point-and-click adventure or escape room with some real-time Elements and the real-time elements were even frustrating because it'd be like most only frustrating because of the waiting like.

858
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:38,418
Speaker 1: alright I want to do this thing.

859
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:39,930
Speaker 1: I need this human to be in this position.

860
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:41,697
Speaker 1: Well, just I got a fucking wait.

861
00:55:41,778 --> 00:55:42,722
Speaker 1: I'm like Jesus Christ.

862
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:43,846
Speaker 1: How are your ass up human?

863
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:44,690
Speaker 0: See I would never wait.

864
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:45,956
Speaker 0: I just saw the problem a different way.

865
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:47,322
Speaker 1: There was no other way.

866
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:48,950
Speaker 1: It's like you want to do a thing.

867
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,101
Speaker 1: It's like why need this human to not be in that area.

868
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:52,870
Speaker 1: I need to wait for them to go to the other area.

869
00:55:53,051 --> 00:56:01,174
Speaker 1: Well, then I could get something they wanted and trick him to go out of the way It's not you know, I need a human to be like, you know It's like oh I can.

870
00:56:01,215 --> 00:56:03,750
Speaker 1: oh I have to scare the human when they're doing a specific task.

871
00:56:03,851 --> 00:56:06,349
Speaker 1: Alright stand and wait for them to be doing that specific task.

872
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:14,249
Speaker 0: You can honk do it to get him to do it pretty quick though by like taking the other thing They want to play with stealing kids plane and then he'll go try to do the other thing instead.

873
00:56:15,051 --> 00:56:17,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like you're down to.

874
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,048
Speaker 1: the one thing you need to do is I can't you know.

875
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:22,450
Speaker 0: But the game is just short enough charming enough interesting enough.

876
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:27,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was any longer the frustrations would have built despite the funny goose, right?

877
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,930
Speaker 1: If it was any harder the frustrations would have built despite the funny goose, right?

878
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:39,890
Speaker 1: But because it was so short and so polished in the environment and so funny and the way the music plays.

879
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:53,750
Speaker 1: Right because they polished that is the music's dynamic like it, right Because the theme and the art and the style and the humor and because all those things were so strong and so short.

880
00:56:54,232 --> 00:56:59,490
Speaker 1: Right, you don't you didn't need a strong game to carry that weight.

881
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:03,007
Speaker 1: You just needed enough game to carry that weight, right?

882
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:09,350
Speaker 1: And So there was right before I was ready, you know, it's like if they had added like two more levels.

883
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:12,245
Speaker 1: I might have actually been here saying this game's garbage.

884
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:13,089
Speaker 1: Don't play no goose game.

885
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:16,080
Speaker 0: What's fun too is that the animation of the goose.

886
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,829
Speaker 0: in particular if you watch people play this game?

887
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:25,827
Speaker 0: The goose ends up acting a lot like a real goose like it's interesting fly or shit.

888
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:26,770
Speaker 1: Well or bite

889
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:41,649
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a relatively nice goose, but part of that is because the way there's like a priority animation system You can see where the goose is always kind of looking at the most interesting thing near it at any given time And when a person walks over the goose just kind of looks up at it.

890
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:43,356
Speaker 0: So the goose is natural.

891
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:56,410
Speaker 0: idle animations interacting animations coupled with your interactions Sort of trick the player into like cosplaying as a goose while you're playing and doing goose like things that are not strictly necessary to win the game or solve a puzzle.

892
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,560
Speaker 1: Yep, it's yeah, that's the thing is like if you're not just trying to win the game.

893
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:06,121
Speaker 1: the inner the environment is so interactive way beyond What a point-and-click adventure game can do.

894
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:10,862
Speaker 0: right when I broke that lady's broom I like ran away with it and hit it like so far.

895
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:12,970
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, just a fucker like that lady.

896
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:14,882
Speaker 0: I was so mad at her in that shop.

897
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:20,610
Speaker 0: when I busted that broom I hit it like in the top corner over by the walkie-talkie by that other house that table.

898
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:25,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was one where I had to collect like a whole bunch of things in like a bucket or something.

899
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:26,500
Speaker 1: What the hell was that one?

900
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:32,534
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I forget what that was and I had to collect a bunch of items and they all had to be in the same like Container.

901
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:35,787
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, it was go shopping There's a grocery list.

902
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:37,093
Speaker 1: But I had to.

903
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:43,678
Speaker 1: I picked up the basket for the grocery list and I carried it all the way the fuck over by the car Super far away.

904
00:58:43,698 --> 00:58:44,283
Speaker 0: I did the same thing.

905
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:45,230
Speaker 0: I went the opposite direction.

906
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:51,632
Speaker 0: I went to the east Okay And then yeah went all the way to the car and then at one point the lady started walking that way and I was like Oh, no She's gonna find.

907
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:57,130
Speaker 1: basically took as many items that weren't on the grocery list as I could and put them over in the east.

908
00:58:57,812 --> 00:59:02,749
Speaker 1: And then I stole items for the grocery thing one at a time and ran them all the way.

909
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:07,209
Speaker 1: Right, because if I leave the grocery thing too close, she's just gonna go for it and put it all back.

910
00:59:07,693 --> 00:59:11,444
Speaker 0: Also a subtle game design point Into avoid frustration.

911
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:12,150
Speaker 0: This is pretty clever.

912
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:20,610
Speaker 0: The game gives you the list of things to do and you have to get all of them done To get to the next area except once you get all but one of them done.

913
00:59:21,132 --> 00:59:24,083
Speaker 0: It adds like a bonus one like it adds one more.

914
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:25,910
Speaker 0: So I did all of them.

915
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I did all of them too.

916
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:39,559
Speaker 0: But if you're getting frustrated or having trouble Getting that bonus one also means the thing that's preventing you from getting to the next area opens up so you could move on Without finishing every item.

917
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:40,483
Speaker 1: Yes, you could always.

918
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:43,079
Speaker 1: you could skip one item Every.

919
00:59:43,643 --> 00:59:44,530
Speaker 0: I can do them eventually.

920
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:52,396
Speaker 0: But that is good subtle game design because if you're frustrated like you just can't solve one particular puzzle Like you can't figure out.

921
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:55,169
Speaker 0: I get the farmer to put on his son had you could just let it be.

922
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,725
Speaker 0: Go interact with a totally different area and sleep on it and come back later.

923
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:09,670
Speaker 1: Yeah design It's also, you know, the humans are stuck in these certain patterns, but like after you accomplish certain tasks Occasionally completing those tests will cause some of the human patterns to change.

924
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,383
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that allows you to accomplish a different task, right?

925
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:15,370
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like that bouncer guy we talked about.

926
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:16,969
Speaker 1: It's like you got to drop a bucket on his head.

927
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:20,926
Speaker 1: And it's like well at the start and when you get in that area, he won't move.

928
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:23,155
Speaker 1: He only hangs in the front He doesn't go anywhere else.

929
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,361
Speaker 1: He doesn't go near any buckets.

930
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:26,130
Speaker 1: So how do you get a bucket on his head?

931
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:33,570
Speaker 1: It's like eventually you complete other tasks and then he'll start walking around And then there's a way you can get him to go near a bucket and drop it on his head.

932
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:37,521
Speaker 0: So if you have not played the goose game, it's a hundred percent worth playing.

933
01:00:37,561 --> 01:00:39,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not such a delightful.

934
01:00:39,107 --> 01:00:41,095
Speaker 1: It's not too expensive It doesn't take too long.

935
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:43,909
Speaker 1: you buy the goose game you play it once and then you're done with it.

936
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:46,970
Speaker 0: Maybe if you're really into it, you can futz around with the second quest.

937
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:50,710
Speaker 1: I think you could come back to it later for a second quest, right?

938
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,577
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm like bored on a plane.

939
01:00:52,638 --> 01:00:55,610
Speaker 0: I might just do like one of the second quest items, right?

940
01:00:55,690 --> 01:01:07,050
Speaker 1: Maybe I think if you're the kind of person who doesn't get frustrated at a point-and-click adventure game And also can handle the real-time elements, right, you know, some people aren't so great with the gamepad.

941
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:19,066
Speaker 1: Right, if you have gamepad skills at least moderate ones and you don't hate point-and-click adventures You could probably play goose game like through several times and get like there's a super bonus I think you get if you beat it enough, right?

942
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,123
Speaker 0: Maybe even enjoy just watching other people play it even though I've already.

943
01:01:23,163 --> 01:01:31,030
Speaker 0: yeah watching people play it is fine, too Right, but cuz everyone I've sat down in front of it has already solved some puzzles in very different ways from how I solved them.

944
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:39,780
Speaker 1: Right, but even if you're someone like me who would hate it if not, but for the humor and style It's still worth buying and playing through one time.

945
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

946
01:01:40,502 --> 01:01:43,270
Speaker 1: Just do all the missions once you completed the game.

947
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:45,325
Speaker 1: You don't need to complete it a second time.

948
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:45,930
Speaker 1: Just there you go.

949
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:52,449
Speaker 1: You saw the great goose game and you've learned valuable lessons for other games, which is you should you know?

950
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,784
Speaker 1: The college is what matter.

951
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:57,884
Speaker 0: Yep And also think your games don't all have to be 70 hour monsters.

952
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:59,350
Speaker 0: a game can be short, right?

953
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,997
Speaker 0: Good experience that ends right?

954
01:02:01,058 --> 01:02:03,790
Speaker 1: It's like a lot of people people who complain the goose game is short.

955
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:08,309
Speaker 1: It's like well Those are little kids with tons of free time who can play fortnight ten hours a day.

956
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:13,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, people complain that RPGs are too long or old people who are like yay goose game.

957
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,758
Speaker 1: I was able to beat a game.

958
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:20,805
Speaker 0: meanwhile despite being an adult with the job I'm feeling this weird powerful urge to play Death Stranding.

959
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:22,692
Speaker 1: Oh The coach.

960
01:02:22,732 --> 01:02:25,521
Speaker 0: apparently it's 70 hours of main gameplay.

961
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:28,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can't get past the first room in Metal Gear Solid.

962
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,282
Speaker 1: So, how would I play that?

963
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:32,365
Speaker 1: I know but Something why would I pay money for that?

964
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:32,789
Speaker 0: I don't know.

965
01:02:33,492 --> 01:02:36,463
Speaker 0: It seems like it's a literal walking simulator and it's calling to me.

966
01:02:36,644 --> 01:02:38,290
Speaker 1: Oh, it doesn't have any like shooting or anything.

967
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:40,680
Speaker 1: It's just a Metal Gear Solid.

968
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:41,684
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

969
01:02:41,704 --> 01:02:43,210
Speaker 0: What do you know anything about this game?

970
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:43,491
Speaker 1: Do you?

971
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:47,412
Speaker 1: I thought it was just Kojima made a Metal Gear Solid game, but it wasn't Metal Gear It's a male.

972
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:54,792
Speaker 0: Kojima made a Kojima game, but the core mechanic is you're just delivering packages by walking Package.

973
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,138
Speaker 1: delivery skills required the walking game.

974
01:02:57,159 --> 01:02:59,084
Speaker 1: So why not just fucking watch it on YouTube?

975
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:02,497
Speaker 0: cuz I want to walk I want to do it Feeling it.

976
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,741
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe you should make a movie instead.

977
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,209
Speaker 0: I Feel like a movie wouldn't work.

978
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:10,536
Speaker 0: I think it's gotta be.

979
01:03:10,556 --> 01:03:13,409
Speaker 0: you gotta have that long experience gonna walk for 10 hours desert bus style.

980
01:03:14,638 --> 01:03:15,785
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think we're done with the goose game.

981
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:24,930
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
