00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,749
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:12,190
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,435
Speaker 0: No Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:18,717
Speaker 0: ride your wave Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:35,740
Speaker 0: Some of you who are watching the live stream might notice that we actually are recording this episode live on Thursday Because the movie was in theaters in the United States One night only and it happened to be last night on Wednesday when we normally would have recorded the show.

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,245
Speaker 1: So why couldn't it be Tuesday?

7
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:41,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, they clearly are not scheduling their theater showings around geek night.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,486
Speaker 0: I feel like we need I need to send them a press release and a Notification like just see one night only.

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,495
Speaker 0: anime screenings must be on Tuesdays not be on Wednesdays.

10
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,200
Speaker 0: They must be on alternating Tuesdays.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,767
Speaker 0: Yes, I can provide here.

12
00:00:52,807 --> 00:01:03,319
Speaker 0: Here is the days you are allowed to schedule a one-night-only United States Subtitled anime screening, you know, maybe because I watched the movie an infinite number of times as a child and I still love it.

13
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:09,920
Speaker 0: But whenever I hear anyone say one night only all I can think of is the blues brothers.

14
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:23,540
Speaker 0: You're only thinking about that because they were advertising their other limited screenings Which I'm gonna go see the blues brothers in the theater because the blues brothers is one of those movies for me that is on That very rare list kind of talk about this a lot.

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,780
Speaker 0: There's like a handful of works of art like mostly movies TV that I can just watch any number of time.

16
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,508
Speaker 0: Like if I walk into someone's house and it's on TV I'll just start watching it until it ends.

17
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:38,980
Speaker 1: and then what if it's on repeat and it repeats before the credits roll?

18
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,908
Speaker 1: Yep, like it just immediately.

19
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,820
Speaker 1: as soon as the credits is just it just immediately starts again.

20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,085
Speaker 0: Yep, like Empire Strikes Back.

21
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:46,832
Speaker 0: That'll do it to me the Blues Brothers.

22
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,297
Speaker 1: You'll just be trapped.

23
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,579
Speaker 1: Yep, right You don't need to make a pit trap.

24
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to kill me and Scott in a dungeon.

25
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:55,398
Speaker 0: just have the matrix on on a random TV.

26
00:01:55,418 --> 00:02:01,859
Speaker 1: in a dungeon You don't need to make like one of those Like a sarcophagus kind of shape thing with a lock on it.

27
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,714
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't need to do any kind of D&D like.

28
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:12,535
Speaker 1: you don't need like a rope Trap with it with a cake in it where your foot gets stuck and now you're hanging Like in return of the Jedi where they're hanging.

29
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:15,271
Speaker 1: and then the you ox God, you don't get any of those traps or like in this.

30
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:15,593
Speaker 0: you can.

31
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:16,699
Speaker 1: you see you can have an open.

32
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:34,060
Speaker 1: You can have an open field an open grass field With a giant projector and as long as you power the projector and keep playing movies that are in the right category back-to-back We will sit there and not leave as long as their food keeps coming and the weather doesn't get shitty.

33
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,917
Speaker 0: Oh Iron Monkey Iron Monkey does it to me?

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,452
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there's a. you know, you didn't see the the unedited Iron Monkey.

35
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:41,475
Speaker 0: No, I did not.

36
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,240
Speaker 0: that's I gotta correct that slightly edited.

37
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

38
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:46,265
Speaker 1: Okay Basically still the same movie.

39
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:51,222
Speaker 0: but uh, so I have a brief story, you know an opening bit from my life Cuz remember.

40
00:02:51,262 --> 00:03:03,627
Speaker 0: well some time ago we had to go to the hospital because randomly this tertiary lamp that had a tempered glass top the top just exploded and showered us in like Broken glass at high velocity.

41
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,935
Speaker 0: It sounded like a bomb went off and that was a whole story.

42
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh Early this morning.

43
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,931
Speaker 1: I get only you could somehow say which he ignites.

44
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,840
Speaker 1: episode that was the opening bit for I could probably find it.

45
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,579
Speaker 0: I think I even said something about it in the show notes.

46
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:20,480
Speaker 0: You know, I can go look at my hospital records for when I went to the hospital.

47
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,005
Speaker 0: so, uh Anyway this morning.

48
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:31,747
Speaker 0: I'm showering and I hear a loud crash and then a bunch of Follow-up debris.

49
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:34,040
Speaker 0: noises happen while I'm showering.

50
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:42,660
Speaker 0: Okay It's loud enough to where it was either in our apartment and a problem or in someone else's apartment and a big problem.

51
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,900
Speaker 0: So I did what all good people do is I pause for a second.

52
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:47,465
Speaker 0: I just kept showering.

53
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:51,560
Speaker 0: cuz I'm gonna finish my shower and then go see what hell awaits me.

54
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,793
Speaker 1: It isn't screaming from people in your apartment.

55
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:59,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, where you need to call a 911 Yeah, or attend or something like that.

56
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,595
Speaker 1: Then you can continue with your shower.

57
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:11,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, no alarms going on but then there's a knock on the door and Emily just says hey So, you know my mirror exploded.

58
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:24,473
Speaker 0: Okay, which marry a lot of mirrors I bet quite a few mirrors the ones that came with the apartment and are built like the ones on the Medicine cabinets that are built into the fixtures in the apartment.

59
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,849
Speaker 1: So in the bathroom above the sink Yep, like there's a mirror on a medicine cabinet.

60
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:35,202
Speaker 0: Yep, and that the me the glass mirror part popped off and Exploded.

61
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:38,093
Speaker 1: so the mirror was not well attached to the cabinet.

62
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,843
Speaker 1: It was not that the cabinet door fell off It was at the.

63
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:50,136
Speaker 1: there's a mirror attached to the cabinet and that mirror popped off the front of the cabinet fell like hit the Sink, I imagine and shattered and now the second shattering you heard was against the ground.

64
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:50,457
Speaker 1: Yep.

65
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,240
Speaker 0: That was basically it.

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,605
Speaker 0: Now what's funny is last night.

67
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,234
Speaker 0: I remember cuz Emily was like weird.

68
00:04:55,294 --> 00:05:04,640
Speaker 0: I was like what and she was like my Bathroom like medicine cabinet door just opened itself And she closed it and it was fine.

69
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,435
Speaker 0: I guess what happened is it must have like started to come off just enough.

70
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,611
Speaker 1: the weight the weight Distribution was and then it undid whatever magnet or thing.

71
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:13,715
Speaker 1: Yeah fastener.

72
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,080
Speaker 1: It has to keep itself closed.

73
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,566
Speaker 0: So today a magnet.

74
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,119
Speaker 0: I worked from home in the afternoon and the super and a bunch of people came to like deal with it.

75
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:24,237
Speaker 0: Cuz I explained to them what happened and they like didn't understand they were like that can't?

76
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:24,819
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,534
Speaker 0: So then they came in and one of them's like, oh And the supers like how the fuck did that happen?

78
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:32,337
Speaker 1: Well, we looked at.

79
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,100
Speaker 1: I saw the photo.

80
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,904
Speaker 1: I didn't go in there yet.

81
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,355
Speaker 0: mostly cuz I don't want to risk all fixed like it's completely.

82
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,500
Speaker 0: it's like nothing ever happened.

83
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,747
Speaker 1: I don't want to step on any glass though.

84
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:39,350
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:42,672
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got a 99% way for you to step on the glass.

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,986
Speaker 1: So I'm still fine.

87
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:49,745
Speaker 1: point is in the photo you showed me I saw that beneath the mirror There were three patches.

88
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,960
Speaker 1: It looked like that mirror was held on with three spots of glue.

89
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:56,574
Speaker 1: Yeah vertically on the one the left side on the left side.

90
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:57,980
Speaker 1: not even like well distributed.

91
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,664
Speaker 1: They didn't even do like a. I would have done at least like a five like a D. You know the five.

92
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,617
Speaker 1: yeah lips on a d6 on the when you roll a five.

93
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:08,691
Speaker 1: Yeah Box with the X right or you could do nine.

94
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:17,706
Speaker 0: nine would be sensible right me don't use too much But I don't actually know what that was because this is like a thing made in a factory and pressed together Probably by a machine.

95
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:17,988
Speaker 0: Yeah.

96
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:18,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely the building.

97
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:20,120
Speaker 1: people didn't put that together.

98
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:22,040
Speaker 1: Yeah Unbox them and they attach them to the wall.

99
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,160
Speaker 0: So they put in a brand new door and everything because they're not gonna like try to replace like the mirror.

100
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:29,159
Speaker 1: I know they try to stick a new mirror on it.

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first of all, they don't have a marriage is lying around but they probably have a spare cabinet liner.

102
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:36,052
Speaker 0: So then they went to all the other because there's four.

103
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,860
Speaker 0: there's four of these things in our apartment.

104
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:45,077
Speaker 0: They went to each one and like poked at it and they're like, yeah, okay I don't see any way this could happen to any of these other ones.

105
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:49,615
Speaker 1: my guess It was probably a combination of you know, humidity changes and hot cold change.

106
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:53,043
Speaker 0: Yeah coupled with manufacturing Contraction.

107
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, like cheap stuff.

108
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:55,332
Speaker 1: It's not like they put in the high.

109
00:06:55,673 --> 00:07:03,153
Speaker 1: It's weird how when you get you know I mean obviously if you got a Super fancy rich wealthy person apartment, right?

110
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,642
Speaker 1: First of all, you're choosing your own Fixtures.

111
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:08,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, those apartments and condos tend to come with nothing.

112
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:11,499
Speaker 1: You're coming with an interior decorator and choosing your own shit.

113
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:23,744
Speaker 1: but most apartments even luxury ones right the fixtures that come with the apartment are Usually like not as cheap as hotel fixtures But not much better.

114
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:29,988
Speaker 1: like only like one because they're gonna get a lot more use than hotel fixtures But basically only one level.

115
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:38,260
Speaker 1: so I know I know you're someone who lives in like You know who doesn't have a lot of money and lives in some cheapy house in the suburbs or rural place.

116
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:46,950
Speaker 1: Your fixtures are actually probably pretty damn good compared to the ones in like a luxury Apartment in the city that costs like twice the mortgage

117
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 0: and I think that part of that is just because like when I got this Apartment, I didn't even look at the whole apartment before I said yes and sign the lease because I was so desperate to find an apartment.

118
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:01,057
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I looked and it's like sometimes they'll splurge in the appliances like the stoves and fridges.

119
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:01,820
Speaker 0: this building.

120
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,302
Speaker 1: I heard of thing.

121
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:03,588
Speaker 0: this building splurged on.

122
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:06,160
Speaker 0: we are next to like seven subways, right?

123
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,077
Speaker 1: But it's like when you build a developer you build a building.

124
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:12,760
Speaker 1: you got you know As though maybe a hundred units or who knows how many fucking units in there?

125
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, right you got to put.

126
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,960
Speaker 0: I want to say there's a hundred and forty in our building, right?

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,342
Speaker 1: Is you got a?

128
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,308
Speaker 1: you want to put in all these?

129
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:18,575
Speaker 1: you got to buy whatever.

130
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:19,963
Speaker 1: you got to buy Stoves.

131
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:23,800
Speaker 1: you got to buy times that many units plus extras in case something goes wrong.

132
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:32,520
Speaker 1: And if it's something like like the heating units you got to buy two or three per apartment Right times the number of units and they've already replaced two of our units, right?

133
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,039
Speaker 1: It's like you're placing like a bulk ass order for like, you know hundreds of things.

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,015
Speaker 1: So how many bathroom cabinets are you buying?

135
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:41,820
Speaker 1: 500 bathroom cabinets?

136
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:50,636
Speaker 1: It's like you don't want to buy a bathroom cabinet that costs five hundred dollars because then you're spending $25,000 in bathroom cabinets you want to buy a $50 one?

137
00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:01,349
Speaker 0: Yep, especially when in New York City someone like me is going to buy the apartment primarily because of its specific address You're not gonna say I'm not going to this apartment the cabinets cheap.

138
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:01,830
Speaker 0: Yep.

139
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:05,262
Speaker 0: Like the countertops is just for Micah like WTF Like now.

140
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:06,084
Speaker 0: don't care right?

141
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:09,637
Speaker 1: You can get one with less solid wood more poorly constructed.

142
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:10,540
Speaker 1: It's got to look nice.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, doesn't matter.

144
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,600
Speaker 1: You know how someone's not gonna be like, oh man, you know this.

145
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:19,377
Speaker 1: You know this kitchen floor is kind of like a crappy kind of floor material.

146
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,180
Speaker 1: I'm moving in here.

147
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,429
Speaker 1: It's not the make or break factor.

148
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:30,699
Speaker 0: When they built the building because we moved in when it was built they ran fiber to every apartment from the Mimi room and and a bunch of other stuff.

149
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:35,903
Speaker 0: and the soundproofing in this building is like Terrifyingly effective.

150
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:41,771
Speaker 1: Well, yeah pretty much every building the new building the soundproofing is yeah I can play my trumpet in the middle of night.

151
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:42,816
Speaker 0: I can play DDR.

152
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:43,560
Speaker 0: I don't hear shit.

153
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:44,463
Speaker 0: You can only hear.

154
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,327
Speaker 1: I only heard shit.

155
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,371
Speaker 1: the only.

156
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,420
Speaker 1: I only hear shit from the hallway.

157
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:55,520
Speaker 1: You know the door is if you're right it's like oh you have an alcove But I just have a door right against an open room.

158
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be way because you have that little tiny hallway entryway that blocks some of the Halloween.

159
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:06,900
Speaker 0: I actually picked this apartment partly because of the alcove and the like pseudo foyer.

160
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:11,491
Speaker 1: Well, also my door is right in front of the elevator and I've decided I'm gonna activity outside the door.

161
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:15,672
Speaker 0: as much as it pains me I'm gonna stop saying foyer because I realized something important foyer.

162
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,709
Speaker 0: the vast majority of mayor of Americans Have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.

163
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,303
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you were gonna say that foyer had a racist Like.

164
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:24,705
Speaker 1: it's like.

165
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:28,159
Speaker 1: is there some history of the word foyer that it should not be?

166
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:30,343
Speaker 1: You

167
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:48,328
Speaker 0: know, that's that's a fair fear because I remember and I won't say the word but I remember an RIT when I was reading a book on bartending and it explained a certain kind of bar and Suddenly I realized that a very commonly used word was in fact a racial slur and I was like Scott Guess what's a racial slur?

168
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,253
Speaker 0: and you were like what?

169
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,310
Speaker 0: Oh Oh shit, and we both stopped saying that word.

170
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:56,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just the other day I was like I was.

171
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:59,080
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about it is not that much to the opening.

172
00:10:59,187 --> 00:10:59,681
Speaker 1: Yeah But I was.

173
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:14,279
Speaker 1: I've been I'm shopping to replace one of my shoe pairs of shoes and I was on a site and it's and there was a shoe and the name of the shoe was prison boot and I was not a hundred percent comfortable with the name of that shoe.

174
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,027
Speaker 0: Prison guard boot.

175
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:18,880
Speaker 1: No, I just it just said prison boot, huh?

176
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,643
Speaker 1: Like that was.

177
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:30,035
Speaker 1: you know, every company like names all those I mean, I guess it's a pretty like Nike will be like, this is the Nike free or this is the I run And this is the Adidas, you know, Stan Smith or whatever.

178
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,280
Speaker 1: Every shoe has a name, right?

179
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,107
Speaker 1: Well, they made this company named their shoe.

180
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,773
Speaker 1: This is the prison boot.

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:36,922
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

182
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:39,579
Speaker 0: I've never heard of the phrase prison boot before.

183
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:41,865
Speaker 0: Seems like it's a style of boot.

184
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,594
Speaker 1: It's the name of a specific boot model.

185

Speaker 1: Yeah Probably change that name.

190
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,460

Speaker 0: it looks really good.

212
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,896
Speaker 0: The animation style looks different and beautiful.

213
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:09,940
Speaker 0: Apparently it's based on a manga.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,958
Speaker 0: It's won some awards.

215
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,187
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go see it this weekend.

216
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:13,267
Speaker 0: Hmm.

217
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,538
Speaker 0: It's just at the theater like right there.

218
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:19,833
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know if it's good, but it looks like the kind of anime I would like.

219
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,906
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You got anything?

220
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we were watching some anime.

221
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,600
Speaker 1: We watched one episode of the show that was on crunchyroll and the show was called science fell in love.

222
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,634
Speaker 1: So I tried to prove it.

223
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,486
Speaker 1: And You know this show.

224
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,680
Speaker 1: I didn't know what it was about other than what I got a guess from the title.

225
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,672
Speaker 1: I guess it's based on a manga.

226
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:46,920
Speaker 1: looking at the cover of the manga I'm like, yeah, I guess the anime is a good at an accurate adaptation of the manga.

227
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,573
Speaker 1: What it's about is basically there are these scientists.

228
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,320
Speaker 1: I can't really tell what kind of scientists they are.

229
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,387
Speaker 1: I guess they're researchers at like a university.

230
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:57,760
Speaker 0: I guess I love scientists that it lays it layer some.

231
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,500
Speaker 0: They are some anime looking motherfuckers.

232
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
Speaker 1: It looks like they're researchers at a university.

233
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:16,092
Speaker 1: But basically at the very beginning of the show right is like, you know The dude is sitting at the computer doing work and then the girl who's got large boobs that are not I guess revealed though Yeah, but they're a large

234
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,019
Speaker 0: warning sign

235
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:22,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, and as a clearly, you know Sexual design.

236
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:25,776
Speaker 1: I guess the dude is supposed to be sexy - I guess there's a bear.

237
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:27,160
Speaker 1: I don't know anyway.

238
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,466
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, this is the stuff.

239
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:29,410
Speaker 1: bear is a character.

240
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,934
Speaker 1: Okay, but I did not in episode one It's sort of like the mascot character.

241
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:36,751
Speaker 1: But anyway In the first episode she basic like.

242
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:45,491
Speaker 1: they're basically talking in a very Sort of that contrived Anime way right or like?

243
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,180
Speaker 1: they're real people don't talk this way.

244
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,980
Speaker 1: They're all like sort of like the way L talks and in Death Note, right?

245
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:59,080
Speaker 1: Only where L is doing detective logic talk they're doing science talk, right and that's the only way they ever talk.

246
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:06,310
Speaker 1: Alright, so, you know, they're talking science at each other and they're clearly have some you know belligerent attitudes towards each other.

247
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:25,497
Speaker 1: and then the girl is like Confesses that she loves the dude and the rest of the entire first episode is them Continuing to do their contrived science talk and attempting to experiment and prove and quantify love to determine if They're really in love or not.

248
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:30,051
Speaker 0: Empirically that sounds like it's very like see anime plot.

249
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:35,091
Speaker 1: that appears to be the plot of not just episode one But literally the entire show.

250
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,540
Speaker 1: and then there are other characters.

251
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:44,940
Speaker 1: Oh, I think the two dudes also go maybe but there was only one other Character in the first episode and that character was like a common-sense person.

252
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like they're both.

253
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,809
Speaker 1: You know the it's like other carry.

254
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:58,757
Speaker 1: all the side characters are all the straight men at least, you know The one straight characters and the two main characters are the messed up ones who are like science science science stuff, right?

255
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:11,500
Speaker 1: Yeah being weird Especially the dude the dude is the weirdest you get the idea that maybe the girl actually Understands and is just trying to you know, get with the dude anyway.

256
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who this is for.

257
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:26,936
Speaker 1: I guess if you have this kind of particular science romance fantasy It's like.

258
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,785
Speaker 0: It's just like it seems.

259
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,349
Speaker 0: so describe it like it.

260
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,131
Speaker 0: Isn't that funny?

261
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,334
Speaker 0: It's not the worst.

262
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:38,286
Speaker 1: I guess it's funny to somebody I've seen.

263
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:39,838
Speaker 1: I've seen worse and I've seen better.

264
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:42,554
Speaker 0: So I don't really do it.

265
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:47,194
Speaker 1: No, it's a really You know formulaic kind of.

266
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:52,380
Speaker 1: you know Mass machine produced anime a court, right?

267
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:54,825
Speaker 1: I don't know.

268
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,836
Speaker 0: See this is the kind of show that we've won.

269
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:57,479
Speaker 1: No it existed.

270
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,193
Speaker 1: now I know it does.

271
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:04,306
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll start when it like every now and then I watch like a one episode of a show to see if it's even worth Reviewing and if it's not.

272
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,852
Speaker 0: I usually just don't even say anything.

273
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:11,490
Speaker 1: This would have gotten probably like a bunch of Excitement and laughs at like an anime club showing.

274
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,704
Speaker 0: Yeah for younger people I would have died.

275
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,160
Speaker 0: this feels like the kind of thing I'd show an episode of at anime club, right?

276
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,545
Speaker 1: But yeah, no, no.

277
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:22,609

00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:09,620
Speaker 0: I watched both Shira and he-man and I watched he-man.

295
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,244
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

296
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,920
Speaker 0: if I watch Shira there could not exceed the same universe.

297
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,540
Speaker 0: But yes, technically not because the planet she runs on like went to another dimension and there's stuff.

298
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:28,848
Speaker 1: Okay but the point is I didn't remember anything of them other than what the characters looked like from my childhood because I had toys and then and Fisto stanko her college at some point.

299
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,115
Speaker 0: I wanted our one he-man episode.

300
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,020
Speaker 1: I downloaded from a file sharing network.

301
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,309
Speaker 0: I think I dressed up as man-at-arms once for that.

302
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,220
Speaker 1: I remembered how bad and then I was like, oh this wasn't actually good.

303
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,693
Speaker 1: I just had nostalgia for this thing.

304
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:40,400
Speaker 1: I didn't remember.

305
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd stop caring about he-man forever.

306
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:54,277
Speaker 0: But all I'm gonna say I want to spoil anything but having seen all the she-ra there is to see As of now all four seasons that are out from the new Shira It just gets better and better and better and it is a fantastic show.

307
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:54,819
Speaker 1: Stop making it.

308
00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:00,053
Speaker 0: It ended on a on a point where there will definitely be more.

309
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:02,300
Speaker 0: basically Grand Admiral Thrawn.

310
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:08,780
Speaker 0: Like the character is basically Thrawn Has now shown up and it's Star Wars terrible secret of space.

311
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:12,379
Speaker 0: The precursor technology has been explained.

312
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,569
Speaker 0: We know the deal with it.

313
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,919
Speaker 0: And now it's moving into like the final plot.

314
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:21,747
Speaker 1: is Admiral Thrawn the The old he-man bad guy or deck.

315
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:25,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, I don't want to spoil got his name, but that's definitely him.

316
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,563
Speaker 0: It's calm.

317
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,660
Speaker 0: Yeah the skull looking guy who is the guy who's not Skeletor?

318
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,580
Speaker 0: He's actually sort of like who stole the baby from King Randor Princess Adora, right?

319
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,807
Speaker 1: He's basically sort of actually like above Skeletor and like evilness He's more competent than Skeletor.

320
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:45,600
Speaker 1: He's more evil than he's sort of like the Unicron to Skeletor as Megatron.

321
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:50,920
Speaker 0: So this gets into that in a Star Wars II kind of way and it's really interesting.

322
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,236
Speaker 1: He's sort of like the Emperor to Skeletor Darth Vader.

323
00:19:54,618 --> 00:20:06,813
Speaker 0: So Hordak yeah, Hordak is like a full power level above Skeletor and in this show Hordak is Himself nothing more than a precursor boss to a square boss.

324
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:15,931
Speaker 0: That is like a mega Hordak Uh-huh, and the mega Hordak is the one hot and a brawny Okay, like this character.

325
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:21,697
Speaker 0: now that I've seen this character Holy shit How do they compare to?

326
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:26,700
Speaker 1: Sexy pirate man, uh I'd say 70%.

327
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,207
Speaker 0: Okay, 60 to 70%.

328
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:31,380
Speaker 0: Hordak himself is pretty hot too, but in a more like torture.

329
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:36,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get to see Hordak not in his suit.

330
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:41,139
Speaker 1: Hordak's hot and kind of sad, okay I'll be like saying like the Emperor is high like what?

331
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,748
Speaker 1: Basically the shriveled thing in a row.

332
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,787
Speaker 0: all the villains and She-Ra are hot Okay, and half of them joined.

333
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:50,780
Speaker 0: their redesigned but also original Hordak is not hot.

334
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,086
Speaker 0: Yes, this Hordak pretty hot.

335
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 1: original Hordak is like clothes is like a like me like a pro wrestler body with a scary face.

336
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:01,633
Speaker 0: Oh, and there's a character double not in a good lucha way.

337
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:03,380
Speaker 0: double trouble is also pretty hot.

338
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:08,295
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know what what I'm telling you about this show, but almost everyone is hot.

339
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:09,218
Speaker 0: You should watch the show.

340
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:17,979
Speaker 0: Okay So I also watched the first bit of Kipo in the age of Wonder Beasts, which is a never heard of this.

341
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,346
Speaker 0: I don't know how you didn't.

342
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:20,692
Speaker 1: this is what I hear of it.

343
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:25,192
Speaker 1: DreamWorks television Animated series that dream works only made movies.

344
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:26,036
Speaker 1: That's news to me too.

345
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,625
Speaker 0: That's Okay, it's on Netflix.

346
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:29,207
Speaker 1: Okay.

347
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,072
Speaker 0: It's very adventure.

348
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:34,140
Speaker 0: adventure time adjacent, but it's also kind of fallout adjacent.

349
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:36,810
Speaker 0: Adventure time is also fallout adjacent.

350
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,619
Speaker 0: So it makes a nice triangle there.

351
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:55,739
Speaker 0: It is plausible that this show basically like spiritually takes place in the intervening years between the apocalypse and adventure time and when adventure time to explore adventure time is a multi-universe universe so it could happen in an alternate adventure time universe that was simply not shown in.

352
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,695
Speaker 0: The plot is basically this it starts in media res.

353
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:08,265
Speaker 0: this girl Falls out of basically a vault into the post-apocalyptic world and she's totally cool like oh shit I gotta get back.

354
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,193
Speaker 1: You mean fallout vault not bank vault.

355
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:13,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, so she's like, oh shit How do I get back into my vault?

356
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:14,351
Speaker 1: Oh, it closed behind her.

357
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:14,813
Speaker 0: Yes.

358
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:15,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, sort of it's kind of.

359
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,367
Speaker 0: She doesn't know where it is.

360
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,100
Speaker 1: You can't get back in the vault and fought either.

361
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:22,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, so she wants to get back into the vault and she's in the outside world.

362
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:24,020
Speaker 0: She's like, oh, I didn't just die.

363
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,879
Speaker 0: maybe the outside world isn't so bad and it's full of dangerous monsters.

364
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:36,148
Speaker 0: and the thing I'll say that recommends the show the most is that the voice acting is like a Plus-plus voice acting.

365
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,020
Speaker 1: it's really good like it stands out above normal good voice.

366
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,594
Speaker 0: It stands out above normal good voice actor the voice actors.

367
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:42,579
Speaker 0: I didn't even look.

368
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:46,416
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm saving it cuz I feel like you should watch something like if they're so good.

369
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:47,180
Speaker 1: We should give them prop.

370
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:47,844
Speaker 0: I think we should.

371
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:49,554
Speaker 0: well, but we're gonna review the show for real.

372
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:51,382
Speaker 0: It's just a geek bite Am I?

373
00:22:51,944 --> 00:22:53,449
Speaker 0: oh I will if you don't know.

374
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:59,173
Speaker 0: so last and least this is news, but We don't actually care about the news.

375
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:03,585
Speaker 0: We care about one Sentence in this news, right?

376
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:06,615
Speaker 1: So we we still like anime Boston the convention.

377
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:12,317
Speaker 0: It's it's in the top two Anime cons in the u.s Now we've been to I would I would argue.

378
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:12,880
Speaker 0: It's pretty safe.

379
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,996
Speaker 1: If you look at the schedule, if you look at the programming they bring the best guess.

380
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:17,960
Speaker 0: they really good Japanese.

381
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:22,541
Speaker 0: The way it's run its run staff are grades run relatively Well.

382
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:23,524
Speaker 1: compared to other cons.

383
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,992
Speaker 1: it is way up there in terms of anime con.

384
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:28,220
Speaker 1: goodness having been through it several times.

385
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I haven't been in quite a while.

386
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:40,080
Speaker 1: But When we went the biggest complaint wasn't something that had to do with the convention staff and the people running the con or anything.

387
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,860
Speaker 0: It was with the city of Boston, right?

388
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,993
Speaker 1: It was that the security at anime Boston was a huge hassle.

389
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,620
Speaker 1: Pax East also has this problem.

390
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,340
Speaker 0: But in anime Boston for a lot of reasons, we're not gonna get into it.

391
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:49,703
Speaker 0: It is.

392
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:56,360
Speaker 0: there are factors that make it Compounded to the point that it is an order of magnitude more a pain in the ass at anime Boston than at Pax East.

393
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,888
Speaker 1: However at anime Boston the behinds convention center We're only the first Pax East was held.

394
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:04,320
Speaker 1: then Pax East moved to a different convention center in the same city.

395
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:12,555
Speaker 1: But anime Boston is still held in the Heinz which is way too small Which is directly physically attached at the hip to a Sheraton Hotel.

396
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:18,604
Speaker 1: All right, so there is if you are wise a Quote secret entrance.

397
00:24:18,644 --> 00:24:27,055
Speaker 1: if you go into the Sheraton Hotel and go up to like the third floor second or third floor It's the third floor near where the blood donating thing is.

398
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,793
Speaker 1: look for Hall C Where we're at least where it used to be.

399
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:30,500
Speaker 1: who knows where it is now?

400
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,051
Speaker 1: They always have a blood donation thing out of a Boston and there is.

401
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:39,780
Speaker 1: basically there's an entrance to the tiny Hallway and at the end of the tiny hidden hallway that feels like you're going nowhere.

402
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,120
Speaker 1: You're going like the back of a hotel ballroom or something.

403
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:55,820
Speaker 1: There's a door that goes right into the back of the artists alley of anime Boston and like most actually Smartly and greatly Kept a security guard there so that you could have your shit checked there and almost no one would use this entrance.

404
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,279
Speaker 0: It was super like it wasn't see there's no one knew about it.

405
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:05,140
Speaker 0: And even if you like until you get past it, it does not look like it will get you into the con, right?

406
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:12,486
Speaker 1: But yeah you could just go into the con that way instead of going out into the world and going in the main entrance or anything like That or waiting any line.

407
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:19,420
Speaker 1: so we would always use that entrance to go in and out of the con At all times and that would work as long as artists alley was still open.

408
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:24,920
Speaker 0: So enemy bosses move in the artist alley and the dealers were and making a whole bunch of very good-looking changes, right?

409
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,140
Speaker 1: So the changes they're making like they're explained why they're making them and they're for good reason, right?

410
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,580
Speaker 1: So the artists out of the dealers room, right?

411
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:42,667
Speaker 1: People want to like hang stuff from the ceiling and shit and the room where the dealers room currently is has a lower ceiling so they can't do ceiling hanging stuff and There's plenty of room.

412
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,719
Speaker 0: it's another credit to anime Boston just to like.

413
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:57,760
Speaker 1: They explain when they make big decisions like yeah If you want to look as an example if you're running any sort of organization and you're making a big change that might upset people This is how you make the press release to announce it.

414
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:07,840
Speaker 1: They fully explain not only what they're doing in great detail with not leaving any information out Yeah, but also their entire reasoning and explanation of why they're doing it without keeping any secrets.

415
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,600
Speaker 1: They're very open right but which is I approve of eight paragraphs in that there's final paragraph.

416
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:16,192
Speaker 0: there is a single sentence.

417
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:18,777
Speaker 0: quotes of final notes.

418
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:21,728
Speaker 0: The Heinz Halsey and made a very.

419
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:33,040
Speaker 1: the lead from the Sheraton third floor will now be Closed because the artist alley is now in a different place and now that secret entrance goes right into the dealers room.

420
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:43,633
Speaker 1: Well, you can't have people just come in in a dealers room at crazy-ass hours or directly from the hotel in a secret back entrance That opens up for shoplifting and all sorts of problems for the exhibitors.

421
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:44,777
Speaker 1: You can't be having that.

422
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:51,860
Speaker 1: so Because that's now dealers room area Rip secret entrance, which I I mean it sucks.

423
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:56,248
Speaker 0: But we've already kind of stopped going to anime Boston and as much as we loved it It was solely because of that.

424
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,020
Speaker 0: security like you write too much.

425
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,736
Speaker 1: But if we had still been going to anime Boston this might have been the reason.

426
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:04,687
Speaker 1: we might have been A very tiny broken straw.

427
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:07,617
Speaker 1: that not for most people people who you know, really

428
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:13,038
Speaker 0: reasonable people We're talking like us trying to lug like two giant cameras and a whole bunch of panel shit right for us

429
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,600
Speaker 1: Not by the secret entrance having to go in the main entrances with all their lines and having to go outside and then inside again.

430
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:25,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, that hassle would have been You know if we were still going.

431
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:32,420
Speaker 1: this announcement would make us no longer go even though Everything else having to do with this announcement is I think a smart correct move for them.

432
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, hundred percent just that one side effect is uh, you know, it's annoying and we we are intolerant.

433
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:44,787
Speaker 0: I mean if I'm walking toward lunch just like on a random day it like just in my daily life.

434
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:53,480
Speaker 0: if I walk if I go up to a place I want to eat lunch at and It looks like there's more than a 30 or 40 second line I'll just keep walking till I find a place that has a line under a minute.

435
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,675
Speaker 0: Like I won't wait any amount of time to eat food.

436
00:27:55,856 --> 00:28:06,240
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway things of the day I did not know this gentleman existed.

437
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:16,539
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've even ever heard his name because as much as I was deep into music Like I don't pay attention to contemporary Conductors composers that much and any of that stuff.

438
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:16,727
Speaker 0: Yeah

439
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,483
Speaker 1: I go on Spotify and if I want to listen to classical music what I do is I find a classical song or composer that I would make

440
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:23,965
Speaker 0: a station

441
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:32,114
Speaker 1: and I right-click on and I say play song radio or play artist radio Yep, and then I don't look at what actually is playing even though I might recognize things that you know.

442
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:33,097
Speaker 1: show up.

443
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:39,914
Speaker 0: Yep, but There is a Dutch Baroque specialist named Peter Jen.

444
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:41,257
Speaker 1: all Dutch things of the day today.

445
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:52,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess we didn't coordinate this Peter John Lucic and He is known for having a quote Singular conducting style.

446
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:54,460
Speaker 1: I have seen many conductors with singular conducting.

447
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,371
Speaker 1: I've never seen I think I have seen this one this.

448
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,516
Speaker 1: I have seen several.

449
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:06,040
Speaker 1: that seems to be a thing With conductors as some of them like to be, you know, sort of like how some baseball pitchers have a wild throwing motion.

450
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,865
Speaker 0: Yep, same guy.

451
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:10,052
Speaker 0: Oh, I as much as I hate watching baseball.

452
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:12,900
Speaker 0: I love watching weirdo pitchers.

453
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:15,480
Speaker 1: I always loved to ever play bases loaded for the NES.

454
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:18,285
Speaker 1: Almost every pitcher would throw.

455
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:18,787
Speaker 1: normally.

456
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:22,478
Speaker 1: some would throw sidearm, but then there would be a few that would throw crazy.

457
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:38,334
Speaker 0: Yeah But this guy's conducting style is amazing and Crazy, but what I want to point out because I actually am it's been a while But I took a lot of classes on conducting both orchestral conducting and field conducting.

458
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:44,335
Speaker 1: Like I'm a trained conductor This style of conduct is last time you conducted anything.

459
00:29:44,536 --> 00:29:45,179
Speaker 0: I mean it's been.

460
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:49,079
Speaker 0: The last time I conducted anything was in the year.

461
00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:04,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I had like CBR training like, you know 15 to 20 years ago, but I'm not gonna go and at one point I was you know a trained Whatever so I could still.

462
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,060
Speaker 1: I could still I would not make that claim today.

463
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:10,440
Speaker 0: I could easily conduct a marching arrangement.

464
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,794
Speaker 0: However, I do not have anything in a you

465
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:14,657
Speaker 1: believe you could

466
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:15,821
Speaker 0: I'm confident Your

467
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,005
Speaker 1: company partly

468
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:31,240
Speaker 0: because that style of conducting requires a lot less nuance and you don't even need to know the song Really to make it work compared to orchestral conducting Which I would need a lot of preparation to be able to do that in even like a baby's first competency.

469
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:39,129
Speaker 0: Well, you know the song first, but watching this guy one thing I will say he has This style as crazy as it looks like.

470
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:42,889
Speaker 0: I just want to say because I saw a lot of people in Twitter being like Does this actually hell like?

471
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,099
Speaker 0: could you actually use this guy?

472
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could conduct you could play to this guy.

473
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,173
Speaker 0: His ictus is like a plus and ictus is all you.

474
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:52,397
Speaker 0: you need ictus and form.

475
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:52,758
Speaker 0: That's it.

476
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:53,360
Speaker 0: That's all you need.

477
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,078
Speaker 0: You're a great conductor.

478
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:56,223
Speaker 1: What do you got me?

479
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,369
Speaker 0: Oh, let's talk about conducting more.

480
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,673
Speaker 1: No, we're good enough conducting.

481
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:03,064
Speaker 1: So another Dutch thing of the day There's the thing you may have heard of.

482
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:11,294
Speaker 1: it is the Dutch head wing headwind cycling championships and basically the way it works mustard shell deckering right in In.

483
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:14,326
Speaker 1: You know the Dutch land, right?

484
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:18,500
Speaker 1: They have this very long bridge that also serves as a sea.

485
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,200
Speaker 0: Well, it's the tangin wind feisten, right?

486
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,640
Speaker 1: It's a very long bridge that also serves as a seawall to keep from getting flooded, right?

487
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,745
Speaker 1: And there's also a bunch, you know It's a very windy place.

488
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:36,380
Speaker 1: and what they do is they set up this cycling championship For and they I think they actually I don't even think it has like a specific day in time.

489
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,425
Speaker 1: I think they like.

490
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:38,369
Speaker 1: they're like they.

491
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:44,038
Speaker 1: they're like they wait for like the windiest time and then they're like Okay, everyone they sent out the message like it's happening tomorrow.

492
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:47,713
Speaker 1: Let's go You know, it's like it's like a short notice kind of deal.

493
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:48,617
Speaker 1: I think I'm not sure.

494
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:59,850
Speaker 1: but anyway The way the competition works is everyone gets the same lame-ass normal one gear, you know every day's Bike you're not bringing like road bikes here.

495
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:10,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if I was gonna do this myself I would like I would basically bring a mountain bike with its tiny little baby gears, right and You have to bike straight into the super hard wind.

496
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,853
Speaker 1: Even though it's flat you're biking into some crazy wind.

497
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,640
Speaker 1: It's ridiculously difficult.

498
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:19,060
Speaker 0: I think you've made this a thing of the day like a decade ago.

499
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:22,900
Speaker 0: It's possible, but never had such high quality video explanation.

500
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,700
Speaker 1: Here's here's a great video of it the most recent one great explanation, you know, it's very short.

501
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,389
Speaker 1: You won't get bored watching this video.

502
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:30,751
Speaker 1: It's not.

503
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,753
Speaker 1: it's even not even ten minutes long I don't think right but it tells you everything.

504
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,086
Speaker 1: two minutes long You know, it tells you everything you need to know.

505
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:37,029
Speaker 0: amazing thing about.

506
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,700
Speaker 0: it is like they can't even get going, right?

507
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:48,864
Speaker 1: But I think I read a story that like this year They actually there was like a storm coming and they were like, hey everyone, come on cycling You know headwind cycling.

508
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:50,449
Speaker 1: and then it was too strong, huh?

509
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:53,940
Speaker 1: And they had to be like no no, it's too strong.

510
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,352
Speaker 1: I don't know if this was them trying again later or if this event somehow Ended right.

511
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:02,058
Speaker 1: It was cut short.

512
00:33:02,662 --> 00:33:04,873
Speaker 0: And but yeah, see this is one of those things like.

513
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:12,420
Speaker 0: I love the idea of it But more importantly I love the idea of watching someone else struggle with this kind of problem.

514
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have zero.

515
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:17,176
Speaker 0: riding into the wind is one of my least favorite things on earth.

516
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:21,152
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I mean there was also a thing of the day very very long time ago.

517
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,900
Speaker 1: There's a competition in Pittsburgh.

518
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,417
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a full bike race or just but there's.

519
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:27,140
Speaker 1: there's a basically.

520
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:37,700
Speaker 1: Oh, I think there might be a San Francisco one also where there's just like a ludicrously steep hill And I think it's like cobblestones - it's like fuck the fuck you Hill the worst possible Hill to bike up.

521
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I feel like that's another.

522
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:42,580
Speaker 0: and where the way to cheat is get a nice mountain bike and just go straight up.

523
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,887
Speaker 1: No pride, but it's like.

524
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:50,671
Speaker 1: but people are still just struggling to go the hill Zigzagging not moving falling over one of those mountain bikes were like.

525
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:54,162
Speaker 0: the front gear is tiny and the bag gear is huge and you're Just like.

526
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,219
Speaker 0: we can we can we can we can we can we can we get the whole way?

527
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, bring a special bike just to go up the hill.

528
00:33:59,223 --> 00:33:59,990
Speaker 1: Even that it's like.

529
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,487
Speaker 1: even if you could you know Turn the crank right.

530
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,920
Speaker 1: you may say it's a lean like to go up that hill.

531
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:07,340
Speaker 1: You have to basically lean all the way over the front handle.

532
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,350
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, when I was when I'm mountain biking me no suji.

533
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:18,280
Speaker 0: like when I'm mountain biking and I'm climbing a steep hill I'm basically standing forward like way over my handlebars.

534
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:20,409
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah And the bikes below me and there's no seat.

535
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,580
Speaker 0: like you you hit a button to make the site disappear.

536
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,081
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

537
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:23,725
Speaker 1: is you all?

538
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:29,849
Speaker 1: you need that weight on the front other so you don't just flip over backwards Right, but you also you don't have any weight on the back.

539
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,454
Speaker 1: that pedaling ain't doing nothing.

540
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:41,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, pedaling a rear wheel in the air Get a bike that pedals the front wheel instead Unicycle That's not gonna get up a hill.

541
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:46,818
Speaker 0: No, I mean a normal bike but have the pedal pedal the front wheel two-wheel drive bike.

542
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:47,460
Speaker 1: Has that been made?

543
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,393
Speaker 0: Oh, I wonder if that's been made.

544
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:50,199
Speaker 0: I'll look that up later.

545
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:52,672
Speaker 1: So I think that might be dangerous in the meta moment.

546
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:53,215
Speaker 0: The geek does book.

547
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,179
Speaker 0: the book is the tale of Genji.

548
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:58,986
Speaker 0: I am continuing to learn how Kind of douchey Genji is.

549
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:02,700
Speaker 1: I just read all about Genji trying to hit on this lady and failing even though he's way hot.

550
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,199
Speaker 0: The more I read Genji.

551
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:10,300
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's just because I saw Urusei Yatsura and read it first and now I'm reading Genji or the other way around.

552
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:14,440
Speaker 0: But Genji reminds me of the main character from Urusei Yatsura.

553
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:17,980
Speaker 1: Like Genji's not stupid and failing at shit.

554
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,951
Speaker 0: That guy's actually not that stupid and when he fails it's not actually even his own fault And he's not even like ugly or anything.

555
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:25,997
Speaker 1: Genji doesn't have bad luck.

556
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:29,909
Speaker 1: Yeah Urusei Yatsura is about him having bad luck.

557
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, Genji doesn't have bad luck.

558
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:38,099
Speaker 0: Genji in fact has Astonishingly good luck, but Genji is born into luck is as lecherous as Ataru.

559
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,005
Speaker 1: No, he is lecherous.

560
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:49,999
Speaker 1: He is but it seems like all the men are lecherous true, but almost all of them I love like the scenes where like they talk about her actually seems while the Emperor has many ladies.

561
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:54,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, the Emperor is actually not really lecherous, right?

562
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:56,120
Speaker 1: Yeah compared compared to compare.

563
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,400
Speaker 0: Well compared to any other male character we interact with.

564
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ones who are like.

565
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:01,890
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm married to this lady.

566
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,235
Speaker 1: I was there with this other one.

567
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:04,440
Speaker 1: I let her go.

568
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,420
Speaker 1: I got this other one.

569
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:14,794
Speaker 0: It's like well, but like I finished a chapter then I like look at the notes again And it's like blah blah blah the implied attempted an affair between Genji and so and so and I'm like what I didn't even catch that one.

570
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:22,580
Speaker 0: Oh Otherwise we'll be live at PAX East which is coming up real quick next week.

571
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,270

00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:50,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna come home and go straight to work.

578
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,980
Speaker 1: No, I'm gonna like work from home or whatever.

579
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,985
Speaker 0: Nah, I'll just take the day off.

580
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,639
Speaker 0: Not gonna waste a vacation day, but I guess I could work from home.

581
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,263
Speaker 0: We'll see how I do.

582
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:58,254
Speaker 0: I think I'm taking a later train home though.

583
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:58,837
Speaker 0: I'm taking like an 11 a.m.

584
00:36:58,857 --> 00:36:58,978
Speaker 0: Train.

585
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,935
Speaker 1: I will quote work from home.

586
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,229
Speaker 0: Yeah But we will be on Saturday at 11 30 a.m.

587
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,218
Speaker 0: In the bumblebee theater, which seats over 600 people.

588
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:13,153
Speaker 0: We'll be saying we will be presenting a repeat panel with minor tweaks.

589
00:37:13,494 --> 00:37:25,640
Speaker 0: take your fucking turn if you are listening to this you do not need to go to this panel because a Version that is 90% the same as what we're gonna do at PAX on PAX East is on YouTube already.

590
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:31,940
Speaker 1: But when we premiered this at PAX unplug Yeah, we're not even gonna bring video and record it to go on YouTube because it's already on YouTube.

591
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:35,634
Speaker 0: So but that doesn't mean if we deviate significantly or something funny happens.

592
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:37,060
Speaker 0: There will be no record of that.

593
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:47,858
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's you're gonna waste an hour of your packs just in case like we make just in case like my pants fall down I'm teeny spontaneously make One joke that I didn't make it.

594
00:37:50,360 --> 00:38:02,086
Speaker 0: But if you have a friend who perhaps should take their turn and you want to punish them Tell them to go to our panel and then at the end of the panel We're gonna tell everybody.

595
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:04,015
Speaker 0: you could have just watched this on YouTube.

596
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:04,999
Speaker 0: You just wasted an hour.

597
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:13,400
Speaker 0: So you will both punish them for not taking their turn and maybe maybe they will listen to us and start taking their turn.

598
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:17,592
Speaker 0: So ride your wave.

599
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:19,440
Speaker 1: All right, so we got another one.

600
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:29,536
Speaker 1: It seems like these days we just keep watching a lot of things from the same people Because you also is cranking out way too much content, right?

601
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:29,877
Speaker 1: Okay.

602
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:30,680
Speaker 1: So here's the thing, right?

603
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,069
Speaker 1: If you look at the top anime directors, right?

604
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:34,394
Speaker 1: You got your Miyazaki Ghibli.

605
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:35,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got your hosted.

606
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,903
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Right.

607
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:42,779
Speaker 1: Oh, so those putting out one every three years Miyazaki and Ghibli are putting out one every century.

608
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:55,000
Speaker 1: Yeah How often it you know, but the point is Masaaki Yuasa and science Aru are cranking out not just TV shows but also movies at a shocking rate.

609
00:38:56,044 --> 00:39:01,488
Speaker 1: So this movie came out in Japan months ago But finally made its way to the u.s.

610
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:03,173
Speaker 1: One night only in US theaters.

611
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:03,976
Speaker 1: some subtitles.

612
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:08,519
Speaker 1: Thanks to G kids, of course Yep, and I said, well, I guess I have to go see that.

613
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:20,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though we it feels like we just talked about walk on girl and also we've not that long ago Reviewed another movie that has a very very very similar.

614
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:22,259
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Lou over the wall, right?

615
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,560
Speaker 1: Also you awesome right and had the same producer is this right?

616
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,289
Speaker 1: There's Lou over the wall.

617
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:30,480
Speaker 1: walk on girl and this bang bang bang.

618
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,504
Speaker 1: It's like they're just.

619
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:35,436
Speaker 1: it feels like those movies are coming way too fast from from the studio Yep.

620
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:50,411
Speaker 0: And uh just to remind you before this because I want to go through some of these ping-pong the animation 2014 adventure time chain 2014 Space Dandy 2014 and then a gap because that's when they founded science Aru.

621
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,356
Speaker 0: and then night a short walk on girl.

622
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,099
Speaker 0: 2017 lower over the wall.

623
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,028
Speaker 0: Also 2017 Devilman crybirds baby 20 only.

624
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:59,539
Speaker 1: I think they only did one episode of space dandy, right?

625
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,840
Speaker 0: Director writer animation supervisor and storyboard for the episode slow and steady wins.

626
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:09,219
Speaker 1: It was like Adventure Time where there was one episode that totally insane that was by them.

627
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,687
Speaker 1: But you know, you also did like one crazy episode.

628
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:14,977
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this movie just the short version is.

629
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,749
Speaker 0: it is Absolutely worth seeing.

630
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,280
Speaker 0: it is a fantastic movie.

631
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,780
Speaker 0: It is extremely well executed and I have very few complaints about it.

632
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's nothing at the same time while that is all true.

633
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:31,107
Speaker 1: It's also not like oh my god It's the best movie ever.

634
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,893
Speaker 1: It's a legendary, right?

635
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:33,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

636
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:37,580
Speaker 1: it's like Great, it's it's between good and great, right?

637
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,500
Speaker 1: But I guess maybe maybe it is great but not legendary great.

638
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:40,962
Speaker 0: What I would

639
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,106
Speaker 1: say is like regular great

640
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:47,424
Speaker 0: for what it is because the story it told was a relatively straightforward story Right, so

641
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:54,544
Speaker 1: I read the synopsis, right and this is not spoiler right for the movie at all because all this stuff happens Super early in the movie

642
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:58,079
Speaker 0: and also you can figure this out from the truth the teaser trailer,

643
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:58,300
Speaker 1: right?

644
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,539
Speaker 1: So this isn't the synopsis of the movie is okay.

645
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:05,979
Speaker 1: There's some you know, 20-somethings that live in like a beach town, right?

646
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,225
Speaker 0: Girls a pro surfer.

647
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:10,235
Speaker 1: the girls like a basically a pro surfer.

648
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:16,940
Speaker 1: the dude is a fireman They fall in love the dude dies and then it becomes a situation like that.

649
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,560
Speaker 1: You know movie ghosts with we'll be Goldberg and those other people right where the dudes a ghost at the pottery, right?

650
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:35,625
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that of all the headlining actors and actresses you might have said as ghosts, you know the movie with I was surprised you said would be Goldberg because that's a Recognizable person.

651
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:39,000
Speaker 1: the other the there's a. the main two people were just generic Hollywood hot people.

652
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,968
Speaker 1: I don't remember their names and I wouldn't recognize them on the street.

653
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,140
Speaker 1: Whoopi Goldberg is a recognizable unique individual.

654
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:45,578
Speaker 0: You don't remember who Patrick Swayze is.

655
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:47,300
Speaker 1: I know that's the name of a famous person.

656
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,940
Speaker 1: But if he walked into this room right now and said what is my name?

657
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,986
Speaker 1: I would say have no fucking clue.

658
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:55,608
Speaker 0: if Patrick Swayze he walked into this room right now Unless he looks radically different from old age or something.

659
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,157
Speaker 0: I would be like, wow, it's Patrick Swayze.

660
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:01,206
Speaker 1: I would say You're unusually hot person.

661
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:03,274
Speaker 1: Are you a Hollywood actor of some kind maybe?

662
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:04,680
Speaker 1: or you know famous person?

663
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,740
Speaker 1: Don't know your name and it's a. I'm Patrick Swayze.

664
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,025
Speaker 1: I'm like, I know that name.

665
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,431
Speaker 1: that is the name of a famous person.

666
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:12,580
Speaker 1: and then I'd say you were in things.

667
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,586
Speaker 1: What were you in ghost?

668
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:14,391
Speaker 1: Oh, I've seen that.

669
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:17,848
Speaker 0: Okay, but To put out like a broader again.

670
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:42,440
Speaker 0: The whole movie is just her sort of processing his death, basically Yes with a little bit of magical realism that does not necessarily need to be real It could just be in her head though There's a fun little nod at the end to make it clear there's a little bit of magic going on, but the movie is exactly what I expected it to be except The execution was so good that I actually want to bring it a lot of praise and point out a lot of very specific things.

671
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:43,547
Speaker 0: I think it did well, right?

672
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:56,705
Speaker 1: So usually the other Yuasa science saru works right are usually sort of you know Plot wise and character wise really out there and like crazy short walk-on girl I defy you.

673
00:42:56,725 --> 00:43:09,905
Speaker 1: to summarize the events of that movie succinctly right to Tommy galaxy Which has the same characters basically is also it's just completely like out there kind of trippy and nutty Right devil man crybaby.

674
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:11,991
Speaker 1: That shit is fucked up and insane right now.

675
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:21,680
Speaker 1: This is really plot wise and character wise Much more in line with a very, you know down-to-earth kind of anime.

676
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, right more in line with a plot you would see from Hosoda though.

677
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:31,446
Speaker 0: But but what it really interested me is that there's actually a pretty good number of characters For how sort of zoomed in.

678
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:38,745
Speaker 0: some of them have almost no screen time, but the characters that get screen time are Surprisingly nuanced characters.

679
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:43,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and a lot of the things I thought oh, I guess I guess that's gonna happen.

680
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,905
Speaker 0: That person will date that person.

681
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:46,833
Speaker 0: None of those things happened.

682
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:48,640
Speaker 1: Oh everything I thought would happen happened.

683
00:43:49,661 --> 00:44:00,880
Speaker 0: Well, the one thing I predicted very specifically was the sister and like her deal Yeah Pick that one up pretty early and I was glad that the other firemen did not date a different character.

684
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:05,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that's a direction a lot more pedestrian version of this movie would have gone.

685
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:08,920
Speaker 0: Well, that's wool Yeah, but the prod not the problem.

686
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,478
Speaker 0: But the interesting thing about this movie is that it's so soon after Lou over the wall and both this and Lou over

687
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,922
Speaker 1: the wall another completely crazy But

688
00:44:15,982 --> 00:44:26,214
Speaker 0: they both in many ways tell a very similar story and they're both about using Water as a metaphor for the threshold of death and transformation

689
00:44:26,254 --> 00:44:32,700
Speaker 1: central plots of both movies Even though one's a children's movie and one is you know a more adult.

690
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:37,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, not completely adult but a more adult romance movie and be like a teenage romance movie.

691
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,177
Speaker 1: Maybe how it right is that they're both about people dying at sea.

692
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,947
Speaker 1: Yep but it's like central to the.

693
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:44,609
Speaker 1: you know

694
00:44:44,729 --> 00:45:04,484
Speaker 0: Lou over the wall was more about water and the mermaids were the metaphor for On one hand the ostensibly suicidal feelings of the main character coupled with like the processing of death coupled with the death of like ideas and culture and like the old way that town was and how things change as time goes on and The past dies eventually.

695
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:18,919
Speaker 0: This one is very literally the death of one person and the reverberations or dare I say the waves that person made both Metaphorically and literally in the world and how that affected the people around them.

696
00:45:19,522 --> 00:45:22,300
Speaker 1: And then well also about the people riding those waves, right?

697
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, the name of the movie comes.

698
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:26,534
Speaker 1: yeah, it's not really subtle with its message.

699
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:31,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a movie it's not to the point where you know.

700
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:42,897
Speaker 1: in sometimes there are movies where or any kind of storytelling medium where you know Their message is so sort of told so ham-fisted Lee and overtly that it's inelegant.

701
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:43,880
Speaker 1: right here.

702
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:47,278
Speaker 1: It is overt right to where they literally just spell it out.

703
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:49,809
Speaker 0: for you It's one of the rare movies that can get away with.

704
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,380
Speaker 0: saying the name of the movie doesn't sound stupid.

705
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,220
Speaker 1: It's like it's like, you know, you need to ride your wave to do that, right?

706
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:08,244
Speaker 1: But they do it in a way that doesn't feel you know, sort of you know tacked on or you know, like Uncomfortable, right?

707
00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:12,818
Speaker 1: Like, you know, it feels like natural and it's just like oh, it's just not.

708
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,546
Speaker 1: it's you know It's like okay.

709
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:17,060
Speaker 1: You didn't really do this in an attacky way.

710
00:46:17,522 --> 00:46:21,019
Speaker 1: You just did it in a way to where there's no way the audience can miss it.

711
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:34,727
Speaker 0: yep, but at the same time what I really appreciate about this movie is how Much it trusted the audience to notice things and how a lot of the subtle things that happen in the movie were not spelled out And it assumed that you would.

712
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:35,692
Speaker 1: well anime.

713
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,200
Speaker 1: anime does that a lot in general?

714
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in particular this one is at one point.

715
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:42,800
Speaker 1: There's a large time skip, right?

716
00:46:43,663 --> 00:46:44,887
Speaker 1: Then there are several.

717
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,260
Speaker 1: you don't really know what happened in that time and it doesn't matter too much.

718
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:55,340
Speaker 1: But there are references or tiny flashbacks to things that it's not a super long time skip, but it's long enough.

719
00:46:55,821 --> 00:47:04,819
Speaker 1: there are tiny flashbacks to events that happened in the time skip or Characters will reference things that happened in the time skip, but they didn't show you those things.

720
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:10,629
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know It's like if I went to rim and said hey Remember the time something happened.

721
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,803
Speaker 1: and the time something happened was not in the movie Yet.

722
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:14,706
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

723
00:47:14,746 --> 00:47:20,002
Speaker 1: It happened during a time in the movie that got ignored, but it's still okay Right.

724
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:20,724
Speaker 1: It totally works.

725
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:21,185
Speaker 0: Yep.

726
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:44,946
Speaker 0: The other interesting thing is and it seems like this is a science Saru thing they hyper-researched like the details of the things they were portraying to the point that like there's a lot of very detailed long-running shots of firefighting techniques and firefighting equipment that is like Accurate to a shocking degree.

727
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:47,613
Speaker 0: the surfing is also extremely accurate.

728
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:50,221
Speaker 0: the life-saving techniques tiny little bits Like.

729
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:56,360
Speaker 0: there's two different scenes where someone like takes an unconscious person and flips them onto a surfboard or a raft, right?

730
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:56,962
Speaker 1: That's like.

731
00:47:57,182 --> 00:47:59,369
Speaker 0: that's a technique you learn in life-saving right?

732
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:05,650
Speaker 1: Like I think because like I was saying this one is much more Grounded in the real world compared to their other works.

733
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:08,540
Speaker 1: right compared to say like loo over the wall, right?

734
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:17,660
Speaker 1: So therefore even though I'm sure they researched things for those other moves works as thoroughly Right say for example, I could there was like a bicycle episode of tatami galaxy.

735
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,799
Speaker 1: I'm sure that they researched bicycles for that.

736
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:26,380
Speaker 1: But because this is much more grounded in the real world the real world matching research shines through.

737
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:35,380
Speaker 1: It's like you can see that they put that work into it when you watch the movie Rather than whereas they might have done it for other things, but it's less visible and and you know obvious.

738
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:44,109
Speaker 0: It was weird for me cuz like I am a son of a fireman and I spent a lot of time around firefighting equipment as a kid and Part of my brain was like that part's accurate.

739
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,734
Speaker 0: That's a Japanese only thing.

740
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:46,316
Speaker 0: That's the.

741
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:47,600
Speaker 0: that's like this class of fire.

742
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,207
Speaker 1: How do you know?

743
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:49,320
Speaker 1: when we talk about anime?

744
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,277
Speaker 1: We talk a lot about at least on the judge anime show which will come back eventually guns.

745
00:48:54,357 --> 00:48:55,200
Speaker 1: We talk about guns.

746
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,585
Speaker 1: It's like hey, you're reading some manga.

747
00:48:56,605 --> 00:49:00,580
Speaker 1: You're watching some anime and that gun is just drawn in exquisite detail, right?

748
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:01,122
Speaker 1: It's like.

749
00:49:01,162 --> 00:49:08,673
Speaker 1: well the person who made this clearly likes guns and it's clearly about the guns, right or the guns could be anything Right and it'll be the cars of the gun.

750
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:09,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

751
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:14,520
Speaker 1: Well in this there are several guns in this movie, right?

752
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,907
Speaker 1: And I think the biggest one is coffee.

753
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:19,614
Speaker 1: coffee is the biggest gun in this movie.

754
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:27,186
Speaker 1: They're basically constantly drawing the process of making coffee and a fire.

755
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:33,672
Speaker 1: firefighting is also a gun yeah, but The detail in the drawing surfing and making amaranth.

756
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:49,138
Speaker 1: Yes the detail in the drawings An animation of people making coffee in cafes on the beach in their homes right is not only a So highly detailed and realistic right to sort of.

757
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:53,755
Speaker 1: you know Appeal to coffee fanboys who you know want to make coffee in a fancy way.

758
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:53,936
Speaker 0: Yeah.

759
00:49:53,956 --> 00:50:09,985
Speaker 1: Well that co2 boom They're always doing it the exact same way every time they do it as like this, you know Repeated, you know imagery to tie, you know various scenes together because it it's subtle But it ties together.

760
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:21,480
Speaker 0: the like the interest in the topic of how to make this kind of coffee Having like spread from person to person in parallel to all the other ideas that spread like waves among these people affecting each other.

761
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,029
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, cuz the dude who died was way into coffee.

762
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:24,772
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

763
00:50:24,852 --> 00:50:29,119
Speaker 1: and then the everyone even after he's dead You see more coffee making than when he was a lot.

764
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,351
Speaker 0: But in terms of something that you clearly met a meta think right.

765
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:48,893
Speaker 1: yes people there's clearly one or more people at the studio Who are way into coffee and this coffee making process in particular also from the definitely inserted it because this coffee fan people at the Studio from the interview was.

766
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,663
Speaker 1: it could have been sir It could have been any.

767
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:51,064
Speaker 1: you know.

768
00:50:51,405 --> 00:51:05,292
Speaker 0: on young Choi the producer they talked a lot about how much research Science are did for this movie in particular and how like they got surfing lessons and life-saving lessons I wouldn't be surprised if they like shadowed a fire department in a beach.

769
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,660
Speaker 1: I wouldn't be surprised that they went to several cafes.

770
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:10,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, right to watch them make coffee.

771
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:14,856
Speaker 0: And I guess like overall cuz like you just it's an anime movie.

772
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:15,600
Speaker 0: like just watch it.

773
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,967
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna explain the rest of the plot to you other than that.

774
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:19,531
Speaker 0: It is deeply satisfying.

775
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:21,537
Speaker 0: It's extremely well animated.

776
00:51:21,557 --> 00:51:22,520
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

777
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:25,049
Speaker 0: It'll hit you right in the feels.

778
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,480
Speaker 0: I cried a few times during it.

779
00:51:26,942 --> 00:51:35,440
Speaker 1: I think the other thing is that you know like I was saying it's not so as crazy surreal and unrealistic as the other works by Yuasa.

780
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:45,379
Speaker 1: But he still manages to put in the trait his trademark art style Right all over it like you can tell immediately who made it.

781
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:58,599
Speaker 1: Yeah Even though it's so different in many ways because of the way the characters move the way the lines on the edge You know the characters don't like, you know whole hold their same like solid shape.

782
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:01,698
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, there's sort of stretchy a little bit and wiggly.

783
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,259
Speaker 1: you know, he always does a little bit of wiggliness and the lines on the edge of the characters are.

784
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:14,160
Speaker 1: It's almost like they're thicker and thinner at the same time because they're sort of you know, they move a little bit, right?

785
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:14,580
Speaker 1: They're not.

786
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:15,603
Speaker 0: Characters.

787
00:52:15,704 --> 00:52:20,740
Speaker 0: all have like pretty unique or interesting walk cycles and like the way characters move is very tied to what they're about.

788
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:25,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you know, of course the is trademark thing of sort of moving the.

789
00:52:25,939 --> 00:52:31,239
Speaker 1: you know It's not a real camera, but the virtual camera perspective and all which is riding her bike, right?

790
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,220
Speaker 1: You know, he'll go he'll go low with wide angles or long crazy angle, right?

791
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:45,429
Speaker 1: All over the place the way he does in, you know a more a less realistic anime right, but he's still doing that.

792
00:52:45,549 --> 00:52:51,700
Speaker 1: in this, you know story that is Mostly just real normal world stuff, right?

793
00:52:52,140 --> 00:53:00,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's enough crazy stuff and magical stuff that like yeah, you couldn't make this live-action Even though it's like.

794
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:04,240
Speaker 1: so you can make like almost all of it live-action, right?

795
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:08,600
Speaker 1: But then they just you know, they make they go in an extra mile.

796
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,420
Speaker 1: It's like no just kidding.

797
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:17,454
Speaker 0: You could like the the ending scene of this movie like that the climax of the movie to make that without animation would be on.

798
00:53:19,903 --> 00:53:25,964
Speaker 0: It would be a practical effects effort on the level of like back to the future - or Like a Star Wars.

799
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:28,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would not be you know doable.

800
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:37,480
Speaker 0: That is one hell of a climax - that was a good scene Yeah, so You know stretches your disbelief a little bit, but it's alright.

801
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,672
Speaker 0: I was totally down with the stretch of belief in that final scene.

802
00:53:40,732 --> 00:53:43,342
Speaker 1: Just I was like, alright, I see what you're gonna do here Fine.

803
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:46,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like in the interview when the producer was like, I'll go.

804
00:53:46,836 --> 00:53:50,816
Speaker 0: you also explained What do you wanted to happen to the end and she was like what?

805
00:53:51,138 --> 00:53:54,311
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like No, no, no, no when he storyboarded.

806
00:53:54,392 --> 00:53:57,767
Speaker 1: She was like, oh That was also interesting in the interview.

807
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:01,000
Speaker 1: We learned that you know, it's like I always feel bad.

808
00:54:01,564 --> 00:54:03,820
Speaker 1: You know when we talk about animes or mangas, right?

809
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,872
Speaker 1: Cuz a manga always like a one or two people get all the credits.

810
00:54:06,932 --> 00:54:09,122
Speaker 1: when I know there were a ton of assistants aren't getting any Credit.

811
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:11,720
Speaker 1: Yeah an anime and movies this on TV shows.

812
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:16,560
Speaker 1: There's a ton of fucking people working on those things and we always just talk about like the one person, right?

813
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,041
Speaker 0: Yeah,

814
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:25,070
Speaker 1: but they she said in the post credit interview that like yeah You also draws a hundred percent of the storyboards themselves,

815
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,657
Speaker 0: which I think Satoshi kon was also that way right

816
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:32,339
Speaker 1: and it's like oh Okay, I guess I can pretty much give you the credit for this whole fucking thing.

817
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:50,939
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right as you know, obviously you you're not fully responsible for every aspect of it but in terms of you know, the the Overwhelming majority of the creative input was at your direction and from your mind You are the primary auteur of this work by far.

818
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,572
Speaker 1: But so I will give you most of the credit for that.

819
00:54:54,973 --> 00:54:59,589
Speaker 0: but going further and I feel too bad But I felt this before.

820
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,200
Speaker 0: but now that we've done now that the track record is basically bat in a thousand.

821
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:07,619
Speaker 0: Science Saru is a really important ice force in anime.

822
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:10,008
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I still wonder if they're overworking their people.

823
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,320
Speaker 1: but more so, you know in the bad anime industry way.

824
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,380
Speaker 0: But on young made a really interesting have like less than a hundred people.

825
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:22,790
Speaker 0: They founded the studio basically to make that Adventure Time episode And then they made everything.

826
00:55:23,674 --> 00:55:30,043
Speaker 0: but all the things they made The the rare in that they make both feature films and television.

827
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:45,880
Speaker 0: yeah, and she talked about how that's how they can have a development pipeline to give up-and-coming people in the animation industry the ability to like Try directing and try like like someone can like be the episode director for something and not like risk ruining a movie.

828
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you look at other anime studios the vast majority of them seem to either be in the TV business Or the movie business and sometimes video game cut.

829
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,800
Speaker 0: But by having both they're getting what the anime industry started to lose in Japan.

830
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:07,600
Speaker 0: If you look at all the greats we talked about and you look at like the works over their lives They all started as like key animation for episode 4 of like Gundam, right?

831
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,471
Speaker 1: But so, you know, I guess madhouse made movies and TV shows.

832
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:12,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like Ghibli only makes movies.

833
00:56:13,406 --> 00:56:14,460
Speaker 1: Is there a Ghibli TV show?

834
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:22,460
Speaker 0: I haven't seen one but she specifically pointed out that they do it Because it lets them have the freedom to have their own internal development pipeline.

835
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:25,640
Speaker 1: It's like you're some new person or you're lower in the totem pole.

836
00:56:25,701 --> 00:56:27,840
Speaker 1: We're not gonna let you make a movie, right?

837
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,280
Speaker 1: The movies are serious biz, but you can have a lot more creative input on the TV shows, right?

838
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:33,963
Speaker 1: I don't think you know.

839
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:37,320
Speaker 1: you also is hand drawing every storyboard for every TV episode.

840
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll trust someone else to draw a story so other people can express their ideas.

841
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:47,117
Speaker 1: You know something like a tatami galaxy or the new show that I watched.

842
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,325
Speaker 1: one episode of it I'm gonna watch.

843
00:56:48,345 --> 00:56:49,539
Speaker 0: keep your hands off a Zukin.

844
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:51,880
Speaker 1: Yeah Keep your hands off a Zukin is their new show, right?

845
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:01,933
Speaker 1: and it's like there's a lot of opportunity for other creators in the studio to have a lot of creative input on those TV shows and Prove that they're good enough and maybe then work on a movie later.

846
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:03,439
Speaker 1: if they're you know, they stand out.

847
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,990
Speaker 1: But still they said there's less than 100 people working.

848
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,134
Speaker 1: They're making all this stuff.

849
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:10,504
Speaker 1: I don't know Doesn't sound like a.

850
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:15,261
Speaker 0: so they got another film coming called you know, it's supposed to premiere in 2021.

851
00:57:15,261 --> 00:57:16,846
Speaker 0: It doesn't even have a Wikipedia page yet.

852
00:57:17,046 --> 00:57:19,393
Speaker 0: Okay, so maybe they're taking a little break now.

853
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,179
Speaker 1: Is there any movie they made after?

854
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,202
Speaker 1: Ride your wave.
