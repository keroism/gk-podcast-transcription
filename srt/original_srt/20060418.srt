1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,481
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday April 18th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,410
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about the fury of Dracula.

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,887
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:22,084
Speaker 0: So I listen to quite a few podcasts while I sit at work and do nothing.

5
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:23,228
Speaker 0: you know and I got.

6
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:27,710
Speaker 0: I got an anime One and a technology one and you know all kinds of different stuff.

7
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:31,586
Speaker 0: And I got one gaming podcast that gamers with jobs radio.

8
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:34,598
Speaker 0: that goes with That gamers of jobs website of course.

9
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,622
Speaker 0: I don't read that website.

10
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,910
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we actually know one of the people there.

11
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway.

12
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:49,198
Speaker 0: They were these two cool dudes, and they talked about video games And they did it better than like you know PC gamer or game spot or one up Or you know any of those people.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,283
Speaker 0: so I listen to them.

14
00:00:50,303 --> 00:01:00,610
Speaker 0: You know once a week whatever They come on episode get in the car this morning and They start going on about how this is the last episode and they weren't kidding.

15
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:03,990
Speaker 0: So now I'm without a gaming podcast.

16
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,648
Speaker 1: It's weird that someone could just stop doing a podcast.

17
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:18,669
Speaker 0: well they stopped doing it because one of the guys got a job with the escapist and They frown upon him doing something they pay him to do for free elsewhere at the same time.

18
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,030
Speaker 1: what?

19
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:20,849
Speaker 1: That's a load of crap.

20
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:22,937
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like you know.

21
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:33,594
Speaker 0: if you pay me to write software for you And I do it for someone else for free at the same time you might be upset I guess, but that's what most open-source developers Do I know.

22
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,886
Speaker 0: but apparently when it comes to writing about video games?

23
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:37,649
Speaker 0: They don't like that.

24
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:45,950
Speaker 0: so They can't continue doing this radio show if he works for them, and he's going to work for them, so that's that.

25
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:47,975
Speaker 1: That's really kind of sad.

26
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it was a really really good show.

27
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:53,069
Speaker 1: if anything the escapist should have used the show.

28
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:58,468
Speaker 0: Well, they can't because gamers of jobs is actually like a profit company kind of thing.

29
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,515
Speaker 1: I guess They could pull something off.

30
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,324
Speaker 1: Maybe better than what they did now.

31
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:03,670
Speaker 1: Just killing a good podcast.

32
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll have to go find a new gaming podcast that probably won't live up.

33
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:09,126
Speaker 1: Well.

34
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,470
Speaker 1: There's always geek nights.

35
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:14,995
Speaker 0: I don't want to listen to myself And I don't talk.

36
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:15,377
Speaker 0: and they.

37
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:18,235
Speaker 0: the thing is I listen to them because they talk about all the video games I don't play.

38
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,230
Speaker 1: why do you want to hear about the video games you never play?

39
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,290
Speaker 0: Why would I want to hear about the ones I already played?

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,214
Speaker 1: But what I mean?

41
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,379
Speaker 1: the games you hear about that.

42
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,805
Speaker 1: you don't like you always bitch about.

43
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:28,870
Speaker 1: so why do you want to hear about?

44
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,065
Speaker 1: What they do or what they are?

45
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,023
Speaker 0: That way I know I'm in I'm informed.

46
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,929
Speaker 1: It's know thine enemy.

47
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:40,012
Speaker 0: so I can do some informed insulting instead of just That way.

48
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:43,307
Speaker 0: if someone comes up to me and is like you don't even know what that game is.

49
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,441
Speaker 0: you just know this is name Of a game that you're not supposed to like.

50
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:46,388
Speaker 0: I can be like.

51
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:47,634
Speaker 0: no I know about that game.

52
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,943
Speaker 0: that game sucks because of XY and Z.

53
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:53,761
Speaker 1: so there yeah I've just got the problem lately of World of Warcraft.

54
00:02:53,801 --> 00:03:03,929
Speaker 1: people who try to talk to me about the game And they'll say things like yeah hearth leek back 1f Bob Baker 9, whatever friggin jargon they have in that game I have no idea what they're saying.

55
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, what happened is simple jargon.

56
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:08,323
Speaker 0: I mean game jargon is okay as long.

57
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:08,905
Speaker 1: All right all right.

58
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,230
Speaker 1: look zerg rush.

59
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,736
Speaker 1: We all know what a zerg rushes.

60
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,442
Speaker 0: I know I don't even play Starcraft.

61
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,346
Speaker 0: I suck at Starcraft.

62
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,510
Speaker 0: I know what a zerg rush is.

63
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,696
Speaker 1: Well, it's obvious because it's self descriptive.

64
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,568
Speaker 1: There's something called zerg and obviously they rush in some capacity.

65
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:31,954
Speaker 1: yep A fire sale usually involves Fire.

66
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:35,670
Speaker 1: say yeah, we should play that game again all right.

67
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:48,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's partly that World of Warcraft seems to be set up to create a complex environment And it's almost like people take pride in knowing the jargon of the complex environment.

68
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,410
Speaker 1: That's utterly alien to others.

69
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:57,506
Speaker 1: It's like they wear their being able to speak in tongues as kind of a badge to non gamers like oh You don't know what I'm talking about.

70
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you don't know what a hearth is what the hell, and I think yeah a hearth.

71
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,749
Speaker 1: That's where I put my fire.

72
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:08,553
Speaker 0: Fear my Linux hacks or podcast skills.

73
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,301
Speaker 0: what Exactly my point?

74
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:15,470
Speaker 1: okay So in actual news this is somewhat old news.

75
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:24,670
Speaker 1: We waited to report it mostly because it didn't seem Entirely possible or credible, but it's been picked up by every news source for a while.

76
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:25,706
Speaker 1: There's really no denying it.

77
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:34,711
Speaker 1: Lucent technologies is suing Microsoft and the end result may very well be the discontinuance of the Xbox 360.

78
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:43,501
Speaker 0: Wait so it is a lawsuit somewhere, and if the lawsuit ends up against Microsoft then Xbox 360 will just die.

79
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,350
Speaker 0: no more games no more systems no more nothing.

80
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,915
Speaker 1: Very it's possible.

81
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:50,930
Speaker 0: won't they just modify the Xbox 360 in some way and bring it back out?

82
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,809
Speaker 1: That's not easy because the games that are already out and that are coming out also rely on the technology at issue.

83
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:08,610
Speaker 1: Okay, basically to make a long long story short There's there MPEG-2 which is used in DVD and a number of other things is a way of encoding video to make it smaller.

84
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,376
Speaker 1: Compressing like mp3 is for.

85
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:14,450
Speaker 0: usually MPEG-2 is sort of well isn't it lossless, or it's really high quality?

86
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,677
Speaker 0: It's very not really so much compression.

87
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:17,701
Speaker 0: It's more like an encoding.

88
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:18,423
Speaker 1: Yes, though.

89
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:20,330
Speaker 1: It isn't far from lossless.

90
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:21,937
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess.

91
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:24,006
Speaker 0: but yeah the point is it's usually not.

92
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:27,530
Speaker 0: it's not like MPEG-4 Where you're trying to fit it on a little tiny thing?

93
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it I mean it does do significant compression mostly because of the limitations of things like NTSC.

94
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:35,255
Speaker 0: Yeah it Basically, but you've used MPEG-2.

95
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:40,715
Speaker 0: you're getting a home movie to fit on one DVD as opposed to a whole movie to fit in Less than a gig.

96
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:50,335
Speaker 1: yeah, it's not very efficient has its issues But that's what DVDs use for the most part and there are a whole bunch of patents around it and almost all of them Are held by this consortium?

97
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,826
Speaker 1: I don't remember all the details the MPEG consortium.

98
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically well I'm not no one cares except us.

99
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:57,103
Speaker 1: I want to get to the meat of this.

100
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:57,507
Speaker 0: all right.

101
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:10,969
Speaker 1: But basically if you have a patent that covers MPEG-2 and you put it in this pool of patents then in return You get a share based on how valuable your patent is of the licensing fees to anyone else who doesn't have a patent who uses MPEG.

102
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:15,510
Speaker 1: So basically everyone who developed MPEG kind of works together and everyone wins.

103
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:16,815
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

104
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:20,210
Speaker 1: Lucent has this patent that they've had for some time.

105
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,150
Speaker 1: They actually sued Microsoft back in 2003 about the same patent so Microsoft knew this was coming.

106
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:35,765
Speaker 1: they have a patent on quote adaptive coding and decoding of frames and fields of view and It basically covers the way the Xbox uses MPEG-2.

107
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:41,030
Speaker 0: How does the Xbox use MPEG-2 besides to play DVDs that you put in it?

108
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:42,775
Speaker 1: I don't know the details of the patent.

109
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:47,250
Speaker 0: I didn't read the patent and I mean of the using MPEG-2 for FMVs and games.

110
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,969
Speaker 1: I think they are all right.

111
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:49,793
Speaker 0: well That would be one.

112
00:06:49,834 --> 00:07:00,850
Speaker 1: also the fact that the way it encodes it or the way it can Encode or decode it or the way the developers can encode it In the end result is that it infringes on the patent in a very obvious way.

113
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:06,250
Speaker 1: Like no one involved in the case denies that it infringes except Microsoft's lawyers.

114
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:10,603
Speaker 0: It's the brightest end with Microsoft giving someone another pile of money, and then whatever.

115
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,406
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

116
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:12,870
Speaker 1: Lucent has more money than Microsoft.

117
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,461
Speaker 1: They're not just gonna back down for some piddly-pittens.

118
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:21,382
Speaker 0: No, but it'll probably be a pile of money Percentage of the total Xbox 360 profits or revenues.

119
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:28,110
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is Lucent is seeking an injunction to halt the sales of the Xbox and all sorts of nastiness.

120
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,222
Speaker 1: They're going for the throat.

121
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:37,170
Speaker 1: Wow No one's really sure exactly why they're handling the way they are But it might actually be a matter of pride or a matter of getting back.

122
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,053
Speaker 1: I mean Microsoft.

123
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:48,729
Speaker 1: this lawsuit came up a long time ago when the Xbox 360 was in development and Lucent sued Microsoft and it was eventually thrown out of court because there was a small typo in the patent.

124
00:07:49,940 --> 00:08:04,552
Speaker 1: I thought Microsoft Okay, so the judge had to throw it out and the only reason the lawsuit reappeared is because they went through the process of fixing the one typo and now the patent is legitimate again and Resuing.

125
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:08,388
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know what Microsoft thought that it would go away that they give up.

126
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:18,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a guy who's a lawyer and his job his entire job since that first lawsuit has been Fixing that patent and ganking the new lawsuit.

127
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,410
Speaker 0: There's a guy whose job it is to come after you.

128
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:21,353
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

129
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:22,236
Speaker 0: not paying attention?

130
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:23,019
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

131
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,344
Speaker 0: Not hiring a hitman to kill him.

132
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,890
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you now?

133
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,790
Speaker 1: I'm curious to see what the result of this will be.

134
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,210
Speaker 1: I mean Microsoft is pretty much said we're not going to pay you we're not going to change the Xbox.

135
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, they say shit all the time.

136
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:35,839
Speaker 1: Now.

137
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,830
Speaker 1: I don't think Microsoft could afford to pay them off right now.

138
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,633
Speaker 1: I mean Vista.

139
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:46,966
Speaker 1: if unless Microsoft's lying and Vista is actually on time and awesome Vista is gonna be a failure or at least not going to do very well.

140
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:48,412
Speaker 1: the Xbox I mean.

141
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,145
Speaker 1: the news today was that the Xbox is plentiful.

142
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,150
Speaker 1: You can just go buy one if you want.

143
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,262
Speaker 1: There's no shortage anymore and no one's buying them.

144
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:54,483
Speaker 0: Yep.

145
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,710
Speaker 0: I actually saw some in a store.

146
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:58,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, Costco has them actually for a significant discount.

147
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,890
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, you can go buy an Xbox premium with a pile of games.

148
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,348
Speaker 0: I think is anyone who wants one has one and now they're just buying games for it.

149
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no one who doesn't have one that wants one.

150
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,057
Speaker 0: maybe in the holiday season coming up since you know It'll be a year old.

151
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,950
Speaker 0: Maybe they can drop the price a bit and people go.

152
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:16,941
Speaker 1: I think they're still selling it at a loss.

153
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,610
Speaker 1: We don't know the details of that though.

154
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,553
Speaker 1: Yeah but anyway there's lawsuit.

155
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:28,670
Speaker 1: depending on how it goes might be big trouble for Microsoft and Every analyst I've seen writing about it basically said that yeah the patent is valid.

156
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,208
Speaker 1: There's no way Microsoft can fight this.

157
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,057
Speaker 0: Now it's never happened before.

158
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:36,230
Speaker 0: we're like a very very popular product.

159
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,483
Speaker 0: It was just taken off the shelves and destroyed.

160
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:39,690
Speaker 0: It's never happened.

161
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:40,834
Speaker 0: I can't remember it.

162
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:44,850
Speaker 1: one IP lawyer said specifically, you know, the rim lawsuit over a blackberries.

163
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was almost the first time it happened.

164
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:59,305
Speaker 1: Yes, they said that the egregiousness of the offense on Microsoft's part and the clarity of the patent is Far greater in this case than it was in that case and that case was pretty solid.

165
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,268
Speaker 0: Yeah that case.

166
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:05,761
Speaker 0: Well, even though NTP was just a company that held patents and nothing else loosens a real company.

167
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:06,664
Speaker 0: It does things.

168
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:08,188
Speaker 0: So this is complete.

169
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:11,959
Speaker 1: Whoa You know, yeah, so we'll we're reporting on it.

170
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,965
Speaker 1: a few people actually asked me about this.

171
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:15,610
Speaker 1: So don't bother us again.

172
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,501
Speaker 1: We'll report again if there's any developments.

173
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,930
Speaker 1: I don't think there will be for a while.

174
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,884
Speaker 1: This is one of those takes years to complete lawsuits.

175
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,190
Speaker 0: That's good for Microsoft.

176
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:27,372
Speaker 0: They can sell years of Xbox 360s and by then they'll sold all the consoles They're gonna sell.

177
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,100
Speaker 0: they can just keep making games and whatever.

178
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:29,582
Speaker 0: Yep.

179
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:33,839
Speaker 1: My only question is I wonder why Microsoft Didn't do something back when they were sued the first time.

180
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,856
Speaker 0: maybe they thought that once they get the system out It won't matter anymore.

181
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,494
Speaker 0: if they could block the Xbox 360 from ever getting sold They'd be fucked.

182
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:44,270
Speaker 0: but as soon as they got it out there, it's out there where they win.

183
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,674
Speaker 1: But back in 2003 couldn't.

184
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:50,410
Speaker 1: they had just paid whatever licensing fee they would have had to pay unless loosen refused to take it.

185
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,704
Speaker 0: Well, see that's the thing is that there's no mandatory patent licensing.

186
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:55,943
Speaker 0: if you don't want to license your patent out You don't have to yep.

187
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:01,942
Speaker 0: So there really needs to be some sort of thing where you know People have to license the patent to you.

188
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:03,270
Speaker 0: if someone has a patent on something.

189
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:17,341
Speaker 0: I mean sure that's not the perfect solution to fixing the whole broken patent system But that's one aspect that needs to be fixed is if someone has a patent and I want to make something that would normally infringe There should be some basic rate that I pay and that's it.

190
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:18,988
Speaker 1: I mean we already have that for music.

191
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,002
Speaker 1: Yep And as much as that system is broken and corrupt and stupid as well.

192
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:23,684
Speaker 1: It's a step up.

193
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:27,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I want to play Someone's songs.

194
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:29,982
Speaker 0: They have to let me if I pay that's.

195
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,490
Speaker 1: yeah, there's even rules about how much they can charge.

196
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:35,458
Speaker 0: Yep, well this standard whatnots and everything.

197
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:35,759
Speaker 0: Yeah.

198
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,490
Speaker 1: But anyway, we went long on that partly because it's our only non fluff news.

199
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:41,004
Speaker 0: Is the fluff news?

200
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:48,690
Speaker 0: Yeah So this guy he bought this shitty Xbox 360 game where you're a World War two pilot or something.

201
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,335
Speaker 0: That's not the point.

202
00:11:50,060 --> 00:12:01,030
Speaker 0: The point is he bought this game And he it has a bug in it a bug that at some point in the game Forces you to fly in circles and die and you basically can't continue with the game because it's a huge bug and it sucks.

203
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,621
Speaker 0: so he went to the store to return the game as Someone should do yep, and he said give me a refund.

204
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,587
Speaker 0: They said we can't give you a refund.

205
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:16,288
Speaker 0: He's like, alright Give me store credit equal to the value of the game and I'll get a different game.

206
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,017
Speaker 0: Like we can't do that either.

207
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:19,062
Speaker 0: we have a store policy.

208
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:20,730
Speaker 1: who a store policy?

209
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:25,009
Speaker 0: So the store policy was that if he tried to return an open game.

210
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:36,990
Speaker 0: his only choices were either another copy of the same game or He could sell it back, you know, you sell it back to the store for like half price and then it kind of sucks.

211
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:46,189
Speaker 0: So he says, you know He argues with him a whole bunch and he gets the manager and he argues a whole bunch and he's like screw your store policy You bastards blah blah blah.

212
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:54,468
Speaker 0: Finally he says fine I'll take a new copy of the same game and he takes it and then he goes over You know to hang with his kid who's looking at DS games, right?

213
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,555
Speaker 0: Then look a minute later.

214
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:57,640
Speaker 0: He goes back over to the counter.

215
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,866
Speaker 0: He says I have a game.

216
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,234
Speaker 0: It's in the package It's unopened and I have a receipt.

217
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:02,738
Speaker 0: I'm returning this for a refund.

218
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:03,580
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

219
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:04,904
Speaker 1: That guy's awesome.

220
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:13,807
Speaker 1: And they were basically like, oh That's very much like what I did when I needed to replace these sunglasses portion of my glasses.

221
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:14,690
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right.

222
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:23,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had some glasses and law I think I might have told the story a long time ago, but someone stole the sunglasses that clip on to my glasses Mm-hmm.

223
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:27,666
Speaker 1: So I go to the glasses place and I say yes, I lost my sunglasses part.

224
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:28,830
Speaker 1: Can I buy another one or something?

225
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,164
Speaker 1: I mean I was willing to just pay Because I mean I felt bad but someone stole it but it was my fault for leaving them on a table.

226
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:34,586
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

227
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,380
Speaker 1: and They say I'm sorry you can you can't buy that separately.

228
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,865
Speaker 1: it comes with the whole frame set.

229
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:43,975
Speaker 1: and I said, oh well I have that warranty thing.

230
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,482
Speaker 1: So can I just get a new frame set?

231
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:47,350
Speaker 1: and they said no your glasses aren't broken.

232
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:56,335
Speaker 1: I said, okay and I left and then I broke my glasses in half and then I walked back in and I went through the Same deal and I got new glasses, you know It's like they could have.

233
00:13:56,757 --> 00:14:07,170
Speaker 0: I mean you probably would have gladly traded in your perfectly Okay glasses for you know, the new ones with the same whatever's yeah, but instead now you gave them some broken ones.

234
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:09,438
Speaker 0: It's pretty stupid to them.

235
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,890
Speaker 0: Yep, they could have sold some used glasses for like half off or something.

236
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,003
Speaker 1: So did this guy's cunning plan work?

237
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:16,070
Speaker 0: Of course it did.

238
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,930
Speaker 0: I mean well, you know, they were real reluctant, but this line built up behind him and he made a scene.

239
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:35,810
Speaker 0: So the guy was like the guy at the store was like, yeah I'm gonna get in big trouble for this blood and he's like fuck you Give me my money in the game his money and then he left And his wife was waiting out in the car the whole time, but then she didn't care.

240
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,481
Speaker 0: She was all cool as she should be.

241
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:38,910
Speaker 1: so all right.

242
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:52,176
Speaker 0: So everyone out there you should know that if a game store refuses to take your return on a game But they have a policy allowing you to get a brand new unopened copy of the same game Do what this guy did and make a scene.

243
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:52,959
Speaker 0: don't be a wuss.

244
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:57,855
Speaker 1: in general whenever a company tries to screw you make a scene Because I mean, I don't want to.

245
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:01,729
Speaker 1: I don't want to suggest to you that you should always be that loud woman screaming and yelling.

246
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,604
Speaker 0: Well, because a lot of woman is yelling about something stupid.

247
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:06,810
Speaker 0: she's not in the right usually.

248
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,534
Speaker 0: Yeah Just a nut.

249
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:14,430
Speaker 1: or the crazy angry guy Standing off the outside the restaurant complaining that he saw a rat because he really just didn't have any money to pay.

250
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:15,473
Speaker 1: That's not cool.

251
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,363
Speaker 1: But if a company legitimately screwed you screw him right back.

252
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,530
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, gotta be smart.

253
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,890
Speaker 0: Got a. you know when they have it's mostly stupid company policies.

254
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:33,592
Speaker 0: You got to beat the shit out of stupid company policies because companies make these things They don't think about them and you use them to get them just as much they use them to get you Yep.

255
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:34,978
Speaker 1: No, of course a lot of.

256
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,513
Speaker 1: sometimes they might just say ask you're the company policy, whatever go away We don't care.

257
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,805
Speaker 1: We don't want your business because you really have no recourse.

258
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:43,918
Speaker 0: at that point Call them BBB bees.

259
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, you realize how many complaints are lodged against companies?

260
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,217
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Jillian and no one really cares.

261
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:52,449
Speaker 1: It is so much to actually get a company without a lawyer.

262
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:55,380
Speaker 0: But it's um, it's like does a tiny bit.

263
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,429
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so it's it's worth it.

264
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:02,759
Speaker 1: It's like bringing out those uh Whatever sorcerers and magic and tapping them every round.

265
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tim Tim Tim Tim some know me as Tim.

266
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,977
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

267
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:22,560
Speaker 1: I found this and I was sitting around bored waiting for something to finish at work And I thought it was rather amusing.

268
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:38,780
Speaker 1: It's basically a rundown of the differences between the North American release of Super Mario Brothers 2 AKA the weird screwy non-canon Mario - where it was all the dream and The Japanese game that it was based on called doki-doki panic.

269
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:43,796
Speaker 1: It basically goes down the list with screenshots and descriptions of every single thing.

270
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:44,980
Speaker 1: That's different between these two games.

271
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,278
Speaker 1: Doki-doki panic didn't look like it was that great of a game.

272
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:52,480
Speaker 0: Doki-doki panic is actually like you think I'll play the original real deal.

273
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,247
Speaker 0: No, it actually wasn't such a good game.

274
00:16:54,287 --> 00:17:06,022
Speaker 1: And when they turned it into Mario - they made it a lot better Yep, and actually little-known fact that Super Mario 2 in the US was actually re-released and re-imported into Japan as Super Mario USA.

275
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:07,208
Speaker 0: that is correct.

276
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:19,125
Speaker 0: and Super Mario - Japan was brought over here inside the Super Mario all-stars cartridge and inside the Game Boy Color Super Mario Brothers cartridge as the Lost World Dun-dun-dun.

277
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:21,357
Speaker 0: Well lost levels lost levels lost worlds.

278
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:21,859
Speaker 0: Who cares?

279
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I got to say is that Super Mario 2 is one of my favorite games.

280
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:30,725
Speaker 0: I don't know actually not such a bad game when you when you get down to it Yeah, it's not.

281
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:33,280
Speaker 0: it's not as good as no Mario 3, but it ain't bad.

282
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:36,000
Speaker 1: But you'd be surprised at some of the changes they made.

283
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,580
Speaker 1: I mean the game itself functions pretty much identically.

284
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:41,792
Speaker 1: But they changed some sprites and they're like one of them.

285
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,860
Speaker 1: they changed one of the vegetables so it looks different.

286
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:46,363
Speaker 1: I really can't figure that one out I don't know.

287
00:17:46,905 --> 00:18:00,645
Speaker 0: one thing that weirded me out is that the the POW the POW bricks Which you know look just and work and look just like the POWs from plain old Mario Brothers were Unchanged except they changed the sound.

288
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:05,400
Speaker 0: but they didn't change the way they look which means doki-doki panic ripped off the pow-blip pow-brite.

289
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,650
Speaker 0: Yeah The POWs from the original Mario Brothers.

290
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:18,700
Speaker 1: The other interesting thing is that doki-doki panic You know in the Mario 2 a lot of the sprites are animated like the hearts do little wobbly-wobblies and everything's kind of animated.

291
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:21,692
Speaker 1: Nothing was animated in doki-doki panic.

292
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:23,077
Speaker 1: Everything was a static sprite.

293
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:23,700
Speaker 1: Just moving.

294
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:27,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really wasn't such a shiny game at all.

295
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:30,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was largely forgotten until the internet brought it back.

296
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:34,677
Speaker 0: Well, you know, that's a good thing because I'm glad I know that.

297
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:41,060
Speaker 1: yeah And the site also has a nice comparison of Super Mario 3 in America versus in Japan.

298
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,589
Speaker 0: There really weren't too many differences with Mario 3.

299
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kuriboh shoe is red.

300
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:48,110
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's not red It just it turns red when it gets hit.

301
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:48,674
Speaker 1: Yeah.

302
00:18:49,057 --> 00:19:00,240
Speaker 0: Yeah But the main change is that in Mario 3 America if let's say you have you know The tanuki suit and you get hit you turn into just plain old Super Mario.

303
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:07,689
Speaker 0: But in the Japanese one if you're the tanuki suit and you get hit you turn into tiny Mario Which makes it a lot harder.

304
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,535
Speaker 0: So here's some other Mario.

305
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:13,351
Speaker 0: That's kind of Freaky like it freaked me out.

306
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,360
Speaker 1: I really don't know what to say to this.

307
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,127
Speaker 0: I have no idea what to say to it either.

308
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:20,240
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna describe it and we'll move on save our sanity.

309
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll say that while I was watching I kept thinking like there was this bearish memory of wait a minute.

310
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,304
Speaker 1: Do I know what this is?

311
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:29,355
Speaker 0: And no, I can't tell what the hell it is.

312
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,338
Speaker 0: It's it's definitely 80s.

313
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,224
Speaker 0: It reeks of 80s.

314
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:35,594
Speaker 1: It involves let's just say all the things it involves.

315
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:36,096
Speaker 0: Mr.

316
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:46,713
Speaker 0: Belvedere ice Mario Koopa some 80s people a whole bunch of little kids Some toad girls who were kind of hot a computer virus.

317
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:48,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we're done.

318
00:19:48,871 --> 00:20:09,980
Speaker 0: Yeah it starts out where it looks like some 80s teen show sort of like a Saved by the Bell but not and One guy's acting all 80s cool Like he's the video master and this hot chick that he's trying to hit on by telling her, you know He's so great at video games and they're trying to play Mario Super Mario Brothers the original Not playing Mario Brothers Super Mario Brothers.

319
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:19,551
Speaker 0: so and then it you know, he's watching it and as soon as she's about to play there's some virus that infects the Nintendo, I guess I'm not sure.

320
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:20,194
Speaker 0: I don't know.

321
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:23,806
Speaker 0: and then all of a sudden mr Belvedere dressed as Koopa appears on the screen.

322
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:36,054
Speaker 0: and then you know, it zooms in on the TV and you see mr Belvedere dressed as Koopa and a bunch of bad guys dressed as Koopa Troopas and Whatever and it's Mario on Ice.

323
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:40,229
Speaker 1: you get like yes There's a bunch of little kids in the audience and it's like five.

324
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:44,259
Speaker 0: It's five to ten minutes at least of Mario on Ice for real.

325
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,112
Speaker 0: and Then after Mario on Ice it zooms back out to the the kid.

326
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:50,477
Speaker 0: but Mario and Ice is freaky.

327
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:51,983
Speaker 0: It's like The.

328
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,111
Speaker 0: the bad guy costumes are pretty good.

329
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,577
Speaker 0: The little kids are scary.

330
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:57,264
Speaker 0: the toad girls Some of them are alright.

331
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:00,073
Speaker 0: the princess talks in this weird voice.

332
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:02,020
Speaker 0: It's not a weird way that big boy.

333
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:14,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one of those voices Which is kind of strange for like Princess Peach now that we know what she talks like Mario and Luigi's voices We're very definitely cartoon original captain Lou Albano style voices.

334
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:25,479
Speaker 0: That's good because that's the kind of Yeah, I like how Mario and Luigi talk in like the Mario and Luigi Superstar games where they're like What's the bottle?

335
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:32,255
Speaker 0: There's like gibbering Italian nothingness, it's just Italian noises that aren't words.

336
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,664
Speaker 0: but yeah They kill.

337
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:36,368
Speaker 0: they kill mr.

338
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:38,176
Speaker 0: Belvedere who's Koopa?

339
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:42,815
Speaker 0: and then You zoom back out to the scary 80s guy and he gets the girl.

340
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:43,780
Speaker 1: Don't forget Luigi.

341
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,120
Speaker 1: They don't jump on the bad guys and said Luigi has this like flamethrower and he just kills them all one by one.

342
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,780
Speaker 0: Luigi pulls a thing on this gun and like a spark bomb comes out and the bad guys just disappear.

343
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:59,880
Speaker 0: They must have a trapdoor or some sort of camera trick to make that happen because I don't know.

344
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,975
Speaker 1: this is one of the weirdest things I've seen in a while.

345
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:09,880
Speaker 1: just watch it and be Scared and if anyone knows what the hell that is the first one to tell us wins.

346
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:12,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, the site isn't very descriptive at all.

347
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:13,952
Speaker 0: Like where it came from.

348
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:16,780
Speaker 0: I guess it's just a video of Mario on Ice.

349
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,206
Speaker 0: That's the only thing I could think of it.

350
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:21,460
Speaker 1: if there was a Mario on Ice how come I was not there as a child?

351
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:26,014
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean I saw freaking like Beauty and the Beast on Ice.

352
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,310
Speaker 0: I think I saw at least at one Disney on Ice.

353
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw Muppet Babies live and I saw Sesame Street live.

354
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,900
Speaker 0: Oh Sesame Street live is the best of the count has his cannon.

355
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:38,053
Speaker 0: I saw that in the theater at Madison Square Garden when I was like three.

356
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually like the Muppet one more.

357
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,149
Speaker 0: I never saw the Muppet one, but I made these.

358
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:44,920
Speaker 0: did I have the the guys in the little balcony going?

359
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:53,606
Speaker 1: It was Muppet Babies, oh Did have little baby old guys in the balcony going ha ha ha ha, you know, I don't even remember I was so young and I lived.

360
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:55,814
Speaker 0: I have no idea, you know, we got to do.

361
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,480
Speaker 0: we got Netflix a Muppet show.

362
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:01,618
Speaker 0: Yo, oh Yeah, so we got to do All right.

363
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:12,159
Speaker 1: So today we thought we would talk about a board game that Scott bought on a somewhat whim after playing once and we decided to play it with our friend Katsu.

364
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,920
Speaker 1: and And it's awesome, but it has a fatal flaw.

365
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:23,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, so a few weeks ago I played this game called fury of Dracula and it's it's.

366
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:24,877
Speaker 0: it's exactly like it sounds.

367
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,000
Speaker 0: it's it's about Dracula.

368
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:27,525
Speaker 1: It's really kind of cool.

369
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:28,870
Speaker 1: how the game works like playing.

370
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,652
Speaker 1: it is awesome.

371
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:32,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a. it's not your typical board game.

372
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:32,906
Speaker 0: Where either?

373
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:33,711
Speaker 0: you know every.

374
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:39,759
Speaker 0: there are two kinds of board games I played in my life every man for himself where everyone's fighting against everyone else to see who can win.

375
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:43,194
Speaker 0: There's the other kind where you're trying to beat the game.

376
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there are a virus.

377
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, there aren't too many games like this, but don't know.

378
00:23:47,512 --> 00:24:00,358
Speaker 0: there's a third type of game, but I'll get to that Where you know the game itself has a winning condition built in and all the players are trying to manipulate Their pieces in such a way as to beat the game itself.

379
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:10,160
Speaker 0: Another type of game a board game that I know is Where there's a DM kind of like a hero quest where one guy or necromunda or doom the board game.

380
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:20,260
Speaker 0: Yeah Where it's like a walk around the map and kill guys and level up and collect items and there's a DM who kind of controls Everything and all the other players are cooperating but also competing for the best treasures.

381
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,440
Speaker 1: Or the Lord of the Rings game, which is every man for himself.

382
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,167
Speaker 1: But there's a secret winning condition where you could fuck everyone and become the Lord of the Rings game is try to beat the game But it's also every man for himself.

383
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,534
Speaker 0: Also every man for himself.

384
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:32,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you can win win.

385
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:38,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, so fury of Dracula is a completely different type of game and that it's four versus one.

386
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:44,259
Speaker 0: It can also be three two or one versus one, but that it's one versus everyone else.

387
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:49,360
Speaker 0: One guy is Dracula and everyone else is the hunters trying to get track.

388
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Lord Golda Ming and Mina Harker.

389
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:54,135
Speaker 0: Lord Godalming, Mina Harker, Dr.

390
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,560
Speaker 0: Seward in Van Helsing.

391
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,849
Speaker 0: Yep, the four hunters trying to kill Dracula.

392
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:10,280
Speaker 0: So one guy has this there's a map of Europe and Dracula has a card for every spot on the map of Europe except for the church where he can't go and his well He has one for his own castle, but it's a special car.

393
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:16,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, the castle see the thing is every card has the location on one side and a blank spot on the other side So you don't know where he is.

394
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:19,375
Speaker 0: But if he goes in the castle that card is double-sided.

395
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:20,139
Speaker 0: so you know where he goes.

396
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:24,818
Speaker 0: See the cards kind of enforce the rules and prevent, you know Dracula from screwing up.

397
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,239
Speaker 1: Yep It's basically a game of hide-and-seek.

398
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:31,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, Dracula goes around Europe and the hunters have to first find him.

399
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:37,794
Speaker 0: if they if Dracula can just stay He if he can run away from the hunters and not get caught by them.

400
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:44,637
Speaker 0: He can pretty much Kick royal ass like if time goes by where they don't know where Dracula is.

401
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:45,219
Speaker 0: He's gonna win.

402
00:25:46,142 --> 00:25:50,756
Speaker 0: You know if you like is every time Dracula goes somewhere he leaves something evil there.

403
00:25:51,177 --> 00:26:06,139
Speaker 0: So he has this trail That's X long and if the hunters don't come across Dracula's trail then the evil things in his trail mature and they can get Dracula a lot of points Like two points and he needs six points to win.

404
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:13,040
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's this day-night mechanic where like during the day the hunters are strong, but at night Dracula and his minions are strong.

405
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:18,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at night you don't want to like let up and try not to find Dracula cuz then you'll lose him.

406
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,755
Speaker 0: But at the same time you don't want to fight him cuz he'll bite you.

407
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:29,180
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, and also the evil things in his trail are a little more powerful at night and all kinds of nasty stuff.

408
00:26:29,744 --> 00:26:30,469
Speaker 0: But I truly it's.

409
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:40,064
Speaker 0: it's really fun for people you know working together and one guy at the table is Dracula trying to run away and figure out what to do and be secretive and Keep his poker face on.

410
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:40,345
Speaker 1: Yep.

411
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,770
Speaker 1: There's definitely two games here.

412
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:45,905
Speaker 1: I mean if you're Dracula, I haven't actually been Dracula yet Scott's been Dracula once.

413
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:46,467
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

414
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:55,621
Speaker 1: It seems like a totally different game, but at least from the hunters perspective It's you and three friends yelling and screaming and arguing and trying to figure out where Dracula is before he kills you all Mm-hmm.

415
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:59,233
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's real easy to figure out where he is and sometimes not so much.

416
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:04,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of discussions Like alright, we know he was in Brussels.

417
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,417
Speaker 1: He was in Brussels two turns ago.

418
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:07,340
Speaker 1: Where did he go?

419
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,027
Speaker 1: I think he headed to Eastern Russia.

420
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,515
Speaker 1: Nobody's been over in Eastern Russia.

421
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:11,340
Speaker 1: You can't go back there.

422
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,394
Speaker 1: We these God of his fry trying to head for Ireland.

423
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:14,160
Speaker 1: Why would he go there?

424
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,033
Speaker 1: He has to go over the water and fuck the water.

425
00:27:16,073 --> 00:27:16,456
Speaker 0: go anyway.

426
00:27:16,516 --> 00:27:16,939
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

427
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,068
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's a real lot of fun.

428
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,000
Speaker 0: the problem with this game takes the fucking ever.

429
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:31,600
Speaker 1: This game is like a three-hour game Like they're not kidding If generally whenever a game says how long it takes to play we cut that in half because we blow through games.

430
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, if a game says one hour we play it in 30 minutes to 45 minutes.

431
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:41,108
Speaker 1: This game said two to three hours and took us three hours not even counting the time It took to teach me and Katsu how to play.

432
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:43,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it took me a while.

433
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:55,859
Speaker 0: I think we spent a lot of time trying to figure out like what the different encounters meant because these little square encounters you have to learn what the symbols mean and the exactly what they do and all that and There are a lot of cards we had to stop and read.

434
00:27:56,261 --> 00:28:00,519
Speaker 0: But even with that we still it wouldn't mean might have been able to cut it down to two and a half hours.

435
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,426
Speaker 0: getting rid of those complications, you know It still took a long time.

436
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:11,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm not sure if the fun of the game Completely mitigates the fact that it takes too long.

437
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:14,340
Speaker 0: There's also the problem that we played it late at night and we got tired.

438
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:16,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even barring tiredness I could see how is.

439
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:24,403
Speaker 1: the game drags on I mean the tension rises but there's a point at which the tension just disappears and I'd rather the game end and not really care Who wins?

440
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:25,226
Speaker 0: Yep.

441
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:27,476
Speaker 0: Yeah that pretty much happens with any game no matter what.

442
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:29,584
Speaker 0: if it takes too long It's like I don't care anymore.

443
00:28:29,645 --> 00:28:33,700
Speaker 0: Just want to finish playing this and do something else because you can only do it for so long.

444
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:45,480
Speaker 0: I also think that If you played with you know a full set of people that if you really got into it You can keep the excitement up of tree of you know, chasing Dracula a little longer.

445
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:50,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the primary fun of the game for the hunters is definitely interacting with the other hunters.

446
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:53,879
Speaker 0: Cuz you're not interacting with Dracula at all.

447
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,348
Speaker 1: Dracula sits there raising his eyebrows periodically.

448
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless he's Scott that he's staring intently at wherever he's hiding.

449
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:04,094
Speaker 0: Well, Dracula has a little tiny mini-map.

450
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:10,582
Speaker 1: it will get to that Alright, so I guess now we could just go into a kind of a technical discussion of the game itself and the mechanics within Mm-hmm.

451
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:18,390
Speaker 1: Now the map I mean is broken up into Eastern Europe and Western Europe Even though for some reason Italy is squarely in Eastern Europe.

452
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:19,875
Speaker 0: I don't know why that is.

453
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:21,220
Speaker 1: and maybe for game balance.

454
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:24,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are railroads all over the map.

455
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:26,562
Speaker 1: There are roads all over the map Reports.

456
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:29,010
Speaker 1: it has I mean as all of Europe even as Ireland.

457
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:30,334
Speaker 0: Yep oceans.

458
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,159
Speaker 1: There are big cities and little cities.

459
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,365
Speaker 1: Hunters can move by rails.

460
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,288
Speaker 1: They can move by roads.

461
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:36,051
Speaker 1: They can get in boats.

462
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:38,680
Speaker 1: Dracula can do anything except ride trains.

463
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:45,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if Dracula rides on boats He loses blood and that's really the only way Dracula can lose if the hunters take away all his blood.

464
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:48,980
Speaker 0: So, you know if he has to run away to the ocean.

465
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:57,050
Speaker 0: He can usually lose the hunters at sea with by various means but at the same time He's gonna lose blood for doing that.

466
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,479
Speaker 0: so he can only do it so many times.

467
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:07,459
Speaker 1: Now every time a hunter goes to a city depending on what kind of city they and they're in larger smaller which hunter they are They can draw event cards and or item cards.

468
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:15,380
Speaker 1: Now items are things that they can just put in their stock and use to various effect things like holy water and crucifixes and garlic.

469
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:16,984
Speaker 1: They're all good.

470
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:17,928
Speaker 1: The best ones.

471
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,153
Speaker 1: I seem to think is the pistol.

472
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:20,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pistol is pretty good.

473
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:31,180
Speaker 0: The dogs are pretty good because the dogs can get rid of a lot of encounters, you know Some of the things that are really powerful like the holy water will be destroyed if you try to use them.

474
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,871
Speaker 0: See, it's like a one-shot super awesome thing.

475
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:35,779
Speaker 1: and then there are events.

476
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,707
Speaker 1: Now the deck seems to be.

477
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:46,800
Speaker 1: it's set up to where two-thirds of the cards are good events for the hunters And one-third are good events for Dracula and you draw from the bottom of the deck.

478
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:52,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because on the back of the cards there's a symbol that lets you know if it's a Dracula event or a hunter event.

479
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:55,859
Speaker 0: So when you draw it, you don't know and looks at it.

480
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,660
Speaker 0: But if it's like a hunter event the hunters all look at it.

481
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,991
Speaker 0: And if it's a Dracula event Dracula looks at it.

482
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:02,559
Speaker 0: that way you don't know what the other team has.

483
00:31:03,142 --> 00:31:04,127
Speaker 1: Yep, it's real scary.

484
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:11,761
Speaker 1: when you draw Dracula event, you know, fuck and you hand it over to him He looks at it and he smiles and then he puts it down face down and he just waits for you to continue with your Turn.

485
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:21,457
Speaker 0: well, it might be a play immediately event in which case he just reads it to you and then laughs Yeah, or it might be an ally in which case he puts it on the side of the board or throws it out.

486
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:28,621
Speaker 1: Yep Now there are multiple schools of thought in terms of events because on one hand there are more good events than bad events for the Hunters.

487
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:34,404
Speaker 1: so you want to draw as many events as you can all the time to get Dracula and some of those events are really Powerful like you.

488
00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:46,880
Speaker 0: only there there are two ways for hunters to like immediately try to get Dracula with like superpowers of finding him And that's resolved which you get one resolve per day or events which can sometimes be as good as resolved.

489
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:52,500
Speaker 0: So, you know getting those events can really help you out if Dracula is really evasive.

490
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:57,600
Speaker 1: But at the same time the more events you draw the more events you're giving Dracula who has no other way to really get.

491
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,972
Speaker 0: Even he has one way to get events, but it's not easy.

492
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:01,420
Speaker 0: It's really kind of sketchy.

493
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:08,053
Speaker 0: So the main way of Dracula getting events is hunters drawing events from the bottom of the decking You know, yeah kill his events showing up.

494
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:16,147
Speaker 1: now the strategy I seem to see in general is that you should generally in the very early game take events because you need to track Dracula and You have no idea where he is.

495
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,633
Speaker 1: a lot of the events help you find him.

496
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:19,844
Speaker 1: at least they'll give you like the end of His trail.

497
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:21,858
Speaker 1: so, you know where to start or something like that.

498
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:30,038
Speaker 0: But once once you have an idea where he is Taking more events can you know hurt you because then he'll get away if the right one comes up.

499
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:30,700
Speaker 1: God the game.

500
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,790
Speaker 1: We played right away like right a freaking way.

501
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:34,954
Speaker 1: We found Dracula.

502
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:36,600
Speaker 0: Well, it was just random chance.

503
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:46,692
Speaker 0: You know I put my guy right next to the hunter hoping the hunter would go to any of the other four possible adjacent cities and then I would follow the Hunter around because they're always gonna try to go to someplace new.

504
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,720
Speaker 0: they'll you know, they think he was just there.

505
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,672
Speaker 1: He won't be there, but I thought before the game even started I'm gonna travel in circles because Dracula can't go to the same city twice.

506
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

507
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:56,900
Speaker 0: I still get away.

508
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:57,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we caught him.

509
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,040
Speaker 1: we tracked him down its day.

510
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,982
Speaker 1: We're gonna go staking.

511
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:04,414
Speaker 1: then we drew an event and the event was Dracula can teleport anywhere for free.

512
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:05,698
Speaker 1: We about cried.

513
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:07,298
Speaker 0: Yep so happens.

514
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:15,756
Speaker 0: There is a certain amount of luck in the game But it can all it can be countered by a good strategy on the hunters and good strategy of Dracula.

515
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:18,845
Speaker 0: overall if Dracula Isn't good at getting away.

516
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:22,883
Speaker 0: He'll be caught and killed and if the hunters aren't good at finding him He'll get.

517
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:25,498
Speaker 0: Dracula will sneak up on them in the night and drink their blood.

518
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:31,835
Speaker 1: Now Dracula can leave these event tiles on the cards as he moves their encounter tiles.

519
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:32,517
Speaker 0: I think yeah.

520
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:37,499
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Now base, I mean the way Dracula moves is he goes through his little deck of every city in the game.

521
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:44,825
Speaker 1: He takes this card of cities going to and he puts it face down on this track and then he can choose to put an Encounter on that.

522
00:33:44,986 --> 00:34:01,177
Speaker 1: also face down if you go to a city You say I went to Brussels and then Dracula either has to show you the Brussels card from his little deck Which means he's not in Brussels or he hasn't been to Brussels recently Or he has to flip over whichever card in his track or in his catacombs.

523
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:07,260
Speaker 0: his Brussels Yeah, because if he's not holding it it must be either on the table in his track or in the catacomb.

524
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:11,339
Speaker 1: Yep, and if there's an event there, he flips over the event and now you have to deal with it.

525
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:20,478
Speaker 0: the events range from From wussy stuff to a guy with a rifle and a knife to kill you Yeah.

526
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:25,509
Speaker 1: or some bats or some fog or Some monsters a vampire.

527
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,235
Speaker 0: the new vampire is the tricky one because the new vampire If you come up on it during the day just dies.

528
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:31,679
Speaker 0: you kill it.

529
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:34,759
Speaker 0: If you come up on it during the night, it can kind of hurt you.

530
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:49,014
Speaker 0: But if you if Dracula puts a new vampire out in a city and you don't find that city and that city falls off the edge of the track And the vampire is still there Dracula gets one-third of the game closer to winning and that can.

531
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:50,219
Speaker 0: that's basically Dracula wins.

532
00:34:51,085 --> 00:35:01,119
Speaker 0: Now you're in big trouble if a vampire falls off the edge So that that's Dracula's key Strategy is put the vampires somewhere the hunters won't find them and get them to fall off the edge of the map.

533
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:11,159
Speaker 1: now Obviously if you only have one of every card Dracula can't go to a place again until that card falls off the trail Mm-hmm, which means Dracula is forced to always keep moving.

534
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:19,100
Speaker 0: Dracula has a lot of restrictions on his movement Which makes it easier for the hunters to figure out where he is as they get information.

535
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:36,297
Speaker 0: You know a small amount of information plus knowing the rules of Dracula's movement can make it pretty easy to limit the places He could possibly be but it's it's never really possible without revealing a ton of information to a hundred percent know where he is and that's how he keeps getting away.

536
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:46,959
Speaker 1: is you know in That small percentage always being in the place The hunters don't try to go unless of course you corner him in a situation of well He's been here here and here and we know he's been there.

537
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:51,498
Speaker 1: The only place he could possibly be is here unless he used as a hiding card.

538
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:54,500
Speaker 0: Yep That's how if you get that's if you get a whole bunch of information.

539
00:35:54,761 --> 00:36:00,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he has a couple of special movements like he can turn into a wolf and at night and jump to cities At night only.

540
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:06,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if he used to use the card Yeah, he can't use it for a while and it informs everyone that he used the card.

541
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,563
Speaker 1: So, you know, ah crap He just jumped a city.

542
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:15,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if Dracula hides that allows him to stay in a city for two nights Which is something you usually can't do but you won't know.

543
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:16,979
Speaker 0: he did that to you.

544
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:19,199
Speaker 0: It looks like he moved somewhere.

545
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:24,700
Speaker 0: But then if you end up in that city, there are two nasty things there now, yeah, it's not great.

546
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,720
Speaker 1: And there are all sorts of tricks like in Ireland.

547
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:28,739
Speaker 1: There's only two cities.

548
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:35,236
Speaker 1: So if he starts in Ireland for whatever reason he can stay there two or at most three days.

549
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:38,477
Speaker 1: if he hides one of those Days then he has to get in the water.

550
00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:47,580
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, of course I can think of a lot of tricks like starting somewhere other than Ireland Going for two days going into the water coming right back where you came from in the water.

551
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:54,608
Speaker 0: Oh, there are lots of nasty tricks If you look at the map real carefully like they're things you can do to really confuse the hunters.

552
00:36:54,669 --> 00:37:07,839
Speaker 0: going to the Atlantic Ocean is one of them because if you Dracula goes the Atlantic Ocean you can pretty much tell when he's in the Atlantic Ocean based because when he goes out to sea he Puts these blue cards down and he loses blood and he can't put nasty things at the sea.

553
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:14,000
Speaker 0: And he goes the Atlantic Ocean and then he plays two more sea cards and then he plays a land card.

554
00:37:14,322 --> 00:37:16,515
Speaker 0: There's like a million possibilities of where he could be.

555
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,918
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary You know.

556
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:24,239
Speaker 0: It's like you look at the map and it's like, oh wow He could be anywhere crap.

557
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:28,440
Speaker 0: That's how the guy when we played against him kept getting away.

558
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,460
Speaker 0: So you go to the Atlantic Ocean go to two more seas get back on land.

559
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,440
Speaker 0: Then we got to close back in the Atlantic Ocean.

560
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:36,925
Speaker 0: Now his blood but he got away.

561
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:41,400
Speaker 1: when you do run into Dracula or a minion you had there's a combat mechanism in the game.

562
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,689
Speaker 1: That's kind of subpar but it kind of works.

563
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, the combat is kind of a. I mean you roll dice Which is the air part?

564
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:55,889
Speaker 1: Yep, you roll dice and then you refer depending on what an item card or attack card you used Versus what item or attack the opponent used.

565
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,220
Speaker 1: you have a little lookup table and you figure out what the event was.

566
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:03,574
Speaker 1: So you basically I play a knife card and he plays a claw card.

567
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:05,540
Speaker 0: It's sort of like advanced rock-paper-scissors.

568
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:13,165
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if I have a claw and he has a knife and I win we look on his knife card Right for the word claw.

569
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,298
Speaker 1: No, we look at your knife your claw card for the word knife.

570
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:16,840
Speaker 0: That's right.

571
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:22,363
Speaker 0: So if I play a claw and he plays a knife and I win we look on my card for the word knife and next To it.

572
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:25,383
Speaker 0: It says what happens and Vice versa.

573
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:29,660
Speaker 0: if his knife wins we look on his knife card for the word claw and we find out what happens.

574
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:30,303
Speaker 1: That's it.

575
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:31,588
Speaker 1: hunters have health.

576
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:34,380
Speaker 1: They can also be bitten by Dracula which basically kills them.

577
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:37,254
Speaker 0: Well, no, it basically kills me in a Harker.

578
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:46,657
Speaker 0: for the other hunters It can help and hurt them to be bitten But if they're bitten twice they'll die, but van Helsing can be bitten three times because he's a badass.

579
00:38:46,678 --> 00:39:00,700
Speaker 1: Yep Now a hunter dying doesn't kick him out of the game it basically just fucks you because Dracula gets two points just like he'd matured a vampire and You lose all your items and you wake up in that Church of Jesus and Mary in Eastern Europe all alone And

580
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,624
Speaker 0: then you lose a turn.

581
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:05,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, which means you can't be looking for Dracula in that turn and he can't be in the church.

582
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:12,660
Speaker 1: So, yeah, yeah Mina Harker getting bitten and dying in our previous game is the main reason Dracula won even though we almost killed him.

583
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:17,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, well Mina Harker starts out with one bite and one more bite will kill her.

584
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:28,874
Speaker 0: so a key strategy for Dracula is do I want to reveal my location and run right after her to bite her and kill her or Do I want to stay hidden and just try to wait it out and win?

585
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:31,446
Speaker 0: I Basically waited it out.

586
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:39,417
Speaker 1: And then when I had my chance I went after and bitter Yep, now each hunter has a power like a minor power and Val help van Helsing.

587
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:43,979
Speaker 0: I almost said van Halen Dude, we should replace it with van Halen.

588
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,790
Speaker 1: We should get a little van Halen now figure awesome.

589
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:49,460
Speaker 1: His power is one that he can be bitten an extra time.

590
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,959
Speaker 1: He's that badass and he can Take an action after he's already taken an action if he kills something.

591
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:59,432
Speaker 1: So anytime he kills something he gets to take another action.

592
00:39:59,452 --> 00:40:03,360
Speaker 0: Well, normally if you go to a city You get to you move.

593
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:05,025
Speaker 0: Everyone's turn is move.

594
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:05,767
Speaker 0: take an action.

595
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:08,314
Speaker 0: Dracula's turn is move the clock.

596
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:10,320
Speaker 0: move Dracula take an action.

597
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,095
Speaker 0: but Dracula's action is putting the little encounters on the little car on the cities.

598
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:16,058
Speaker 0: the hunters.

599
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:21,514
Speaker 0: action is Taking event and item cards, but if there's an encounter in a city they go to.

600
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,480
Speaker 0: they don't take item and event cards.

601
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,798
Speaker 0: Their action is spent dealing with the encounter.

602
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:32,765
Speaker 0: Helsing gets the advantage that if he deals with an encounter like let's say there's some bats Normally you deal with the bats.

603
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:33,528
Speaker 0: your turn is over.

604
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,220
Speaker 0: van Helsing can deal with the bats and still take item and event cards.

605
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:37,958
Speaker 0: Cuz he's so cool.

606
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:46,019
Speaker 1: Yep Now Mina's already bitten and there's a mechanic where if you're bitten Dracula gets bonuses against you and he can see some of the cards you've got all the time.

607
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:48,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz he can control your mind and shit like that.

608
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:54,760
Speaker 0: But yeah There's one advantage to being bitten and that's that some the other hunters can hypnotize you to find out where Dracula is.

609
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:57,968
Speaker 1: yep, and because Mina's always bitten you can always do that.

610
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:04,467
Speaker 1: now Mina's actual normal power other than that is that she can basically draw two Events when she resupplies or two items.

611
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,009
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

612
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:06,774
Speaker 1: Are you good the Lord?

613
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:12,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't talk about training We didn't talk about trains, but there Dracula can only go on the roads or in the water.

614
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:13,500
Speaker 1: hunters can also use trains.

615
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:16,332
Speaker 0: That's basically how they catch Dracula once they know where he is.

616
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:18,280
Speaker 0: They use those trains and they catch right up to him.

617
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,326
Speaker 0: So we can't run away.

618
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:20,292
Speaker 0: All you can do is hide.

619
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:21,500
Speaker 1: the trains are semi-random.

620
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:30,258
Speaker 1: You have to roll this die and basically you either get to move one two or three spaces or you don't get to move at All or you lose your turn.

621
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,144
Speaker 0: Yeah The train can kind of suck.

622
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:39,230
Speaker 0: and the other thing is that trains in Eastern Europe suck and trains in Western your know trains in Western Europe trains in Eastern Europe suck.

623
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, Russian trains pieces of crap They're all yellow on the board.

624
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:51,354
Speaker 0: Yeah It's basically this one spot and it dies is two three And if you roll that number that is a one out of six.

625
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:55,600
Speaker 0: chance that you roll it, of course It's a six-sided die, of course, of course.

626
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:59,473
Speaker 0: and if you roll that number and you're in Western Europe you move three spaces.

627
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:02,323
Speaker 0: and if you if you're in Eastern Europe you move Two spaces.

628
00:42:02,764 --> 00:42:06,096
Speaker 1: now the Lord's power is that he gets to roll the die again.

629
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:08,358
Speaker 1: if he doesn't like the result He's just so rich.

630
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:11,440
Speaker 0: Yeah But he has to suffer with the second result no matter what it is.

631
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:18,867
Speaker 0: So if he gets a one and he wanted a two or more and he rolls a zero oops Then doesn't he get a bonus against fighting people or something?

632
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,090
Speaker 0: He gets something else.

633
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:20,872
Speaker 0: It's not so useful.

634
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:23,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there's dr.

635
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:23,899
Speaker 1: Seward.

636
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:24,582
Speaker 0: Dr.

637
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:26,412
Speaker 0: Seward is who I was when I was a hunter.

638
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:27,498
Speaker 0: He's actually pretty cool.

639
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,029
Speaker 1: Yep now there's a mechanic of instead of taking items you can rest which basically heals the hunter.

640
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:39,800
Speaker 1: and The drawback to that is that if you rest you draw two event cards and if they're good events for the hunters you throw them.

641
00:42:40,384 --> 00:42:42,279
Speaker 1: But if they're Dracula events they take effect.

642
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,327
Speaker 0: So basically just it.

643
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:46,655
Speaker 0: basically letting Dracula draw two event cards.

644
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:54,200
Speaker 1: if you try to get your health back Now the doctor you only draw one if you're near the doctor when you heal or if the doctor tries to heal himself.

645
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:59,540
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you're thinking about getting some blood back the the doctor you had to go near the doctor.

646
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,500
Speaker 0: But at the same time that means you know when hunters get together they can like form hunting groups and stuff.

647
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:08,020
Speaker 0: But you're really limiting your ability to search for Dracula when you do that.

648
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,823
Speaker 1: Yep, you do that.

649
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:12,360
Speaker 1: Basically when you know where he is, you're hunting him down and he doesn't have any events left.

650
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:20,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, if all the hunters get together they can move together and you know take items and events together and if they do that They're really powerful.

651
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,999
Speaker 0: and if they catch Dracula like that, they can pretty much kick his ass.

652
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:31,800
Speaker 0: You know as long as me and Harker is not in the group then she'll just die Because Dracula will just go for her and forget about the rest and bite away.

653
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:37,300
Speaker 1: So I guess in conclusion this game is generally awesome and it's really really fun to play.

654
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:49,432
Speaker 0: Yeah but if you Get bored from sitting there too long Either the people you're playing with they're running out of energy or they can't concentrate on it that long Then it might not be the best game to play too often.

655
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:56,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't bring this game to a party or It's something you want to plan ahead for be ready for and get all into it.

656
00:43:56,356 --> 00:44:07,382
Speaker 0: if you're not all into it It's not worth it because you know if this game was an hour long you play it all the freaking time But because it's two or three hours you gotta you know Ration it.

657
00:44:08,004 --> 00:44:08,165
Speaker 1: Yep.

658
00:44:08,305 --> 00:44:10,854
Speaker 1: We're definitely not bringing it to Tarkov this weekend.

659
00:44:10,894 --> 00:44:12,539
Speaker 1: There's no way we'd have a chance to play it.

660
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,869
Speaker 0: No, we'll bring Kayla's probably and something else.

661
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:18,235
Speaker 1: Yeah every other board game we own.

662
00:44:18,576 --> 00:44:19,599
Speaker 0: No, not every one of them.

663
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:22,391
Speaker 1: Well, no, we're not bringing a strategic.

664
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:22,612
Speaker 1: Oh,

665
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:47,660
Speaker 0: but if you're looking for a good you know nighttime activity for you and for friends or You know, you got a weekend with nothing to do and a bunch of people are real bored But they're ready to get into something long and invest time into something great then Furia Dracula is really good and you know, it doesn't require as much Difficulty as like a war game or something, but it's just as much fun strategies.

666
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:59,980
Speaker 1: And once again in closing this weekend if you're in the Rochester area, we're going to be doing our first live Official show at a con at Tora con at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

672
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:24,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're actually looking at the submissions and talking about them and thinking and we're hoping to see more.

673
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:31,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't have any sort of deadline But that doesn't mean you just wait around forever because we're gonna pick one as soon.

674
00:45:31,115 --> 00:45:32,360
Speaker 0: basically as soon as we see one.

675
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,868
Speaker 0: That's good enough.

676
00:45:32,888 --> 00:45:33,457
Speaker 0: We're gonna pick it.

677
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:39,540
Speaker 0: So if you have one that's even better than that, but you don't get it in before then that's how you're gonna lose.

678
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, once we pick one, we're probably not going to unpick it.

679
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:44,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it's gonna be sort of a permanent thing.

680
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,356
Speaker 0: So, you know don't rush but don't be lax.

681
