1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,708
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, January 27th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:10,949
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:13,659
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,148
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nides.

5
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,139
Speaker 0: Tonight, it's burger time.

6
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,217
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,260
Speaker 0: Which is happily nothing like Goofy Time.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:29,785
Speaker 1: Hooray.

9
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:32,823
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're back.

10
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:37,880
Speaker 0: We kind of didn't do shows after Magfest and kind of before Magfest for a bunch of reasons.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,060
Speaker 1: Well, it's all, you know, we got incredible snowstorms, so it's not nice to go outside.

12
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, multiple blizzards.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,127
Speaker 1: Evo is not snowing.

14
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:44,994
Speaker 1: It's really cold.

15
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:45,860
Speaker 1: You don't want to go outside.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,748
Speaker 0: I've been skiing.

17
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:47,660
Speaker 0: We had Magfest.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,180
Speaker 1: And Magfest, which is incredibly cold and you don't want to go outside.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:59,398
Speaker 0: One thing I can say about Magfest is that, you know, aside from our Magfest show, a four-day convention, remember Otacon was like, "Hey, think we're going to do a four-day convention

20
00:00:59,418 --> 00:00:59,639
Speaker 0: again?".

21
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:00,087
Speaker 1: No.

22
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:00,679
Speaker 1: Never.

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,538
Speaker 1: Whole no.

24
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:06,360
Speaker 0: It wrecked me about as much as it wrecks the staff, I think, going to a convention for four days.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, four days is a bit much.

26
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:08,718
Speaker 0: Like, I remember.

27
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:10,119
Speaker 1: Especially 24/7 four days.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Saturday at Magfest.

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,600
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's like, you know, you can have a lot of extra fun on that one day.

30
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:20,040
Speaker 1: Even though we showed up late on the Thursday, there was still a lot of extra fun because, you know.

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,156
Speaker 0: We showed up late on that day, but it didn't matter because there was the 12-hour line.

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:35,420
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, but, you know, you still, you get a lot of extra fun out of those hours, you know, because there's a lot more hours in there than you realize, but it's not worth an extra vacation day, right?

33
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:36,554
Speaker 0: It depends.

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,020
Speaker 1: The convention has to be ludicrously awesome for it to be worth.

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,239
Speaker 0: I would go to a four-day PAX.

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, what could they really put in that one more day?

37
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:48,280
Speaker 0: One more day of playing board games?

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,520
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, but I had a day of playing board games at Magfest, you know?

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, we played board games with a lot of friends, and it was difficult to convince strangers to play.

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,564
Speaker 0: Mmm.

41
00:01:59,242 --> 00:01:59,780
Speaker 0: Different culture.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,933
Speaker 0: But anyway, we're back.

43
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,299
Speaker 0: We're bad.

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,760
Speaker 0: The Geek Night schedule is resuming mostly, though we got a bunch of crazy stuff coming up, but we'll get to that.

45
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:08,176
Speaker 0: Mostly PAX.

46
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:16,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, PAX is coming, immediately followed by Zenkai Con, and then it's going to be a break, and then there's going to be more convention.

47
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:17,197
Speaker 0: Yep.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,403
Speaker 0: So, you got any news?

49
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,513
Speaker 0: I mean, it's Thursday, and, you know, stuff's happening.

50
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:21,820
Speaker 0: There's chaos in the Middle East.

51
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,917
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there's been so much news since we last did a show that I had so much news to do, but all the news is I wanted to save for the other days of the week, so I'm like, "What

52
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:30,279
Speaker 1: news?"?

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Speaker 1: You know, Thursday is the day where you can do a news that normally doesn't fit, so I got to find a news that doesn't fit.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,652
Speaker 1: So, I figured, well, Thursday is the book club day.

55
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:40,198
Speaker 1: I'll do a book-related news.

56
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:40,800
Speaker 1: How good is that?

57
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,980
Speaker 1: So, apparently, you know, TED, Technology Education Design, who does all the TED Talks and the conferences and the TEDx's and all these things.

58
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:50,355
Speaker 1: Yep.

59
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,452
Speaker 1: You've seen the videos on the internet, I hope.

60
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:53,660
Speaker 1: If not, what the hell?

61
00:02:55,001 --> 00:03:04,360
Speaker 1: They have now introduced TED Books, which is a line of books that have the TED logo on them, and, you know, featuring people who gave TED Talks and are TED-type people.

62
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,237
Speaker 1: And, you know, so, okay, so there's books with the TED logo on them.

63
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:08,860
Speaker 1: Big deal, right?

64
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,054
Speaker 1: Well, one of these books that they've already announced is particularly interesting is called "Beware Dangerism.

65
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:20,199
Speaker 1: Why we worry about the wrong things and what it's doing to our

66
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:20,500
Speaker 1: kids.".

67
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:27,432
Speaker 1: And this book obviously talks about how, you know, people, you know, mostly parents are like, "Oh, my God.

68
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:30,598
Speaker 1: Can't have a kid walking outside without me outside

69
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:30,898
Speaker 1: also.".

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,300
Speaker 0: I lived in Detroit, and I rode my little bike a quarter mile to get to the school.

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:36,980
Speaker 1: Right.

72
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,205
Speaker 1: You know, so it's like, you know, how.

73
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:46,960
Speaker 1: even, you know, even since we were kids, this "dangerism" mentality has increased a ton, and since my parents were kids, it's increased even more a ton.

74
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,460
Speaker 0: Well, Scott, as Pete taught us from playing danger patrol, the real answer is to maximize danger.

75
00:03:51,460 --> 00:04:06,240
Speaker 1: Right, but I mean, you know, it's the thing is, right, is like, you know, like, for example, my mom used to just walk to school and she was way little, you know, and but now she is, right, you know, she has the "dangerism" mentality.

76
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,206
Speaker 1: She did it, but she wouldn't let me do it, right?

77
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:11,095
Speaker 1: So it's like, how does that happen?

78
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:12,800
Speaker 1: How do you go from doing something to that?

79
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,486
Speaker 0: Of course, many of those things have often been that way.

80
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:21,320
Speaker 0: I mean, how many people's parents smoked pot when they were young and would not let their children smoke pot?

81
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Speaker 1: Right, but, you know, the thing is, is people have this impression that the world is more dangerous now than it was when the reality, statistically, is that the world is far, far less dangerous than it was.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's like people say, oh, there's so much more pedophilia now and like child kidnappings.

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,321
Speaker 1: No, there isn't.

84
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,506
Speaker 1: There was way more pedophilia back in the day.

85
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:42,849
Speaker 1: It's just now.

86
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,660
Speaker 1: whenever there's one pedophile, they make a huge story about it, whereas back in the day, it was like a pedophile.

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:58,340
Speaker 0: Well, there is a very telling statistic that was reported in the Dallas News last week about how in 1969, I believe 15 percent of children were driven to school by their parents.

88
00:04:58,682 --> 00:04:58,880
Speaker 1: All right.

89
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,413
Speaker 0: Today, that number is over 75 percent.

90
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,215
Speaker 1: Whoa, that's a big change in the very 20, 30 years.

91
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,000
Speaker 0: Granted, my parents drove me to school every day until I was 16 and started driving myself.

92
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:17,460
Speaker 0: But the reason they did so was that the buses were just like, it was basically Mad Max and I didn't want to put up with that shit.

93
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,372
Speaker 1: I always took the bus.

94
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:19,000
Speaker 1: It was just fun.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, my school district was Mad Max.

96
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:22,794
Speaker 0: At least in middle school.

97
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,424
Speaker 1: Was it really Mad Max?

98
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:33,979
Speaker 1: Because all those parents, those 75 percent of parents driving their kids to school, they're all going to say, "It's Mad Max on the bus.

99
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:34,560
Speaker 1: I got to drive my

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:34,760
Speaker 1: kid.".

101
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,133
Speaker 1: Or they're going to say, "It's not convenient to wait for the bus.

102
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:38,279
Speaker 1: I have to leave the house to get to

103
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,380
Speaker 1: work.".

104
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,890
Speaker 0: A lot of kids got broken noses on those buses.

105
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,115
Speaker 0: There were fights regularly.

106
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,500
Speaker 0: I was involved in some of the fights.

107
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,799
Speaker 1: I fought on the bus, but I kept going on it.

108
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I broke a kid's nose when I was in middle school.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,282
Speaker 1: There you go.

110
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,632
Speaker 1: That's what you're supposed to do on the bus.

111
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:50,660
Speaker 1: That was the problem.

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,859
Speaker 0: The other thing was the bus took for fucking ever.

113
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:54,980
Speaker 1: I didn't take that long.

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,100
Speaker 0: My bus took about 45 minutes to get me home because it made stops every five feet.

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,012
Speaker 1: On the way home, I was like, "The bus always gets you to school on time.

116
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,056
Speaker 1: It's not going to get you to school

117
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:03,297
Speaker 1: late.".

118
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,820
Speaker 1: Why was it never late on the way to school?

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,859
Speaker 1: I'd never been late to school on a school bus.

120
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:17,780
Speaker 0: Plus, the other kind of, I don't know, maybe conflating factor, at least with the bus thing, is that before I could drive myself, I did stuff after school.

121
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:23,820
Speaker 0: I was in clubs, and if you were in anything, if you were in school more than five minutes after school- You needed a ride home.

122
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was one bus that went to every part of the entire town, and it took two hours to get you home, so screw that.

123
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:31,981
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

124
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:42,360
Speaker 1: I think our school had a ... I don't remember which school had it, but I think there was a late bus, but I don't remember if I ever successfully used it or not.

125
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,110
Speaker 0: See, part of it, too, was in high school, at least, where I grew up, there wasn't-

126
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,233
Speaker 1: On the late bus, and-

127
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:58,920
Speaker 0: Well, there wasn't a lot of demand for the busing, because once you were in high school, almost everyone had a friend who drove to school every day and would drive them, or would drive themselves.

128
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,259
Speaker 0: I mean, the school's parking lot was as big as IBM's parking lot was.

129
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:06,075
Speaker 1: School parking lot was always big troubles of fighting.

130
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:06,960
Speaker 1: There weren't enough spots.

131
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, ours was gigantic.

132
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:12,157
Speaker 0: The thing is, you'd have to park, I don't know, a mile away from the school if you got the late- So like RIT.

133
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:24,019
Speaker 0: However, me being smart, which is get to school an hour early and then do all the homework that I didn't want to actually do, copying it off of other people in the band room before school- You were giving up sleep, though.

135
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,804
Speaker 0: I was giving up sleep, but then I made up for it in class.

136
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:34,959
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know, I feel like the dangerism thing is a valid concern, and most people say, "Oh, you're just saying that because you don't have any perspective

137
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:35,320
Speaker 0: anymore.".

138
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,380
Speaker 0: It always feels like things are different when you're older and you complain about it.

139
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,744
Speaker 1: I've looked at all these statistics.

140
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,733
Speaker 1: All the statistics are probably in this book, right?

141
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,558
Speaker 1: You don't have to take it from my word.

142
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,385
Speaker 0: Well, look at the evolution of the playground.

143
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:50,498
Speaker 0: When we were kids, our parents said, "Yeah, playgrounds were way more

144
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:50,860
Speaker 0: awesome.".

145
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:54,080
Speaker 0: And they could back that shit up by pointing out the dangerous shit that they used to do.

146
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:57,260
Speaker 1: I went on fast metal slides and metal jungle gyms.

147
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,962
Speaker 0: But think about this.

148
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,331
Speaker 0: Our parents said playgrounds were pussified.

149
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,500
Speaker 0: We now say playgrounds are pussified.

150
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:07,720
Speaker 0: I can point out things I used to do that are gone, and our parents can point out things they used to do that are gone.

151
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:10,559
Speaker 1: See-saws, spinny wheel thing.

152
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,000
Speaker 0: But I'm not that worried, because this is a pendulum, and I think it swings back and forth.

153
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,994
Speaker 0: Look, now there's a movement of reclaiming playgrounds.

154
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,180
Speaker 0: that's really moving.

155
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,440
Speaker 0: Have you seen the playground over in Vernon Jackson those kids play on?

156
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,880
Speaker 0: It is way more awesome than anything we had as kids.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,159
Speaker 0: And it's super dangerous.

158
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:28,520
Speaker 1: Lava pit traps.

159
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, lava pit trap.

160
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:30,079
Speaker 1: Ah, shit.

161
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,620
Speaker 0: But while it's super dangerous, it makes up for that.

162
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,859
Speaker 1: Tarzan rope over the lava pit trap.

163
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,159
Speaker 0: With a piece of technology.

164
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:35,698
Speaker 0: That's greased.

165
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,462
Speaker 0: The surface?

166
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:42,299
Speaker 0: As a kid, you could basically jump off the top of the toppest thing, land on your head, and be mostly okay.

167
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:44,287
Speaker 0: I couldn't do that.

168
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:45,880
Speaker 0: I'd land on asphalt and break myself.

169
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:48,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you lived.

170
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,480
Speaker 1: I jumped off lots of tall things, and I was just fine.

171
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,279
Speaker 0: So, Ted Book?

172
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:54,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ted Book.

173
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,978
Speaker 0: That was your news?

174
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,478
Speaker 0: Yeah.

175
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,500
Speaker 0: So, this is old news that for some reason is in the news again, but there were some recent movements on it.

176
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,579
Speaker 0: None of the movements were good.

177
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:04,584
Speaker 0: The old news thing.

178
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:13,640
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about that much, other than the fact that it's weird how old news seems to come back from like two years ago, because two years ago everyone ignored it and suddenly everyone loses their shit.

179
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,679
Speaker 0: Even though it's the same news, same situation, nothing's changed.

180
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,780
Speaker 0: But anyway, courts have ruled that Dungeons and Dragons is not allowed in prisons because it threatens prison security.

181
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:25,553
Speaker 1: Really?

182
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:31,758
Speaker 0: Quote, "It can mimic the organization of gangs and lead to the actual development

183
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:32,359
Speaker 0: thereof.".

184
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,328
Speaker 0: Hey, prisons.

185
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,340
Speaker 1: I got prisoners.

186
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:46,240
Speaker 1: If you're the kind of prisoner who plays D&D, and you just got your D&D taken away from you by the guards, send me an email or a letter, because I know you can write letters to people in prison, right?

187
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:47,660
Speaker 0: I'll mail you some burning wheel.

188
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,300
Speaker 1: I will mail you some burning wheel or some other RPG that is not D&D and it will be all good.

189
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:57,320
Speaker 0: Imagine they're sitting around playing D&D and here's what the warden hears.

190
00:09:58,342 --> 00:09:58,805
Speaker 0: I shiv him.

191
00:09:58,825 --> 00:09:59,611
Speaker 0: What do you mean you shiv him?

192
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,578
Speaker 0: I backstab him.

193
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:04,507
Speaker 1: Flurry of blows.

194
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,660
Speaker 1: That's for the shower room.

195
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,960
Speaker 0: But what bothers me is another statement from the ruling.

196
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:14,720
Speaker 0: Quote, "During D&D games, one player is denoted the dungeon master.

197
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:23,055
Speaker 0: The dungeon master is tasked with giving directions to other players, which the guy testified as saying, mimics the organization of a

198
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:23,457
Speaker 0: game.".

199
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,320
Speaker 0: Now, by that logic, education in prison mimics the organization of a gang.

200
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:33,140
Speaker 0: The warden mimics the organization of a gang.

201
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,498
Speaker 0: Pretty much anything mimics the organization of a gang, except-- Why do you keep saying "game"?

202
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,259
Speaker 0: Same gang.

203
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:43,857
Speaker 1: When you say "gang," you sound like you're saying

204
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:44,179
Speaker 1: "game."

205
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,345
Speaker 1: Gang.

206
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:46,992
Speaker 1: You need some more "ang," like

207
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:47,295
Speaker 1: "tang.".

208
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,329
Speaker 0: This bothers me on another level.

209
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:57,160
Speaker 0: A more fundamental problem is that role-playing is probably one of the more constructive things people in prison could be doing.

210
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,718
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, they could be role-playing a bank heist.

211
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,000
Speaker 1: Even so, even so.

212
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,780
Speaker 1: And then practicing for the real deal.

213
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,940
Speaker 0: What is one of the most common causes of violent behavior in criminals, especially not that intelligent, kind of low-level criminals?

214
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:15,940
Speaker 0: A lot of studies show that it has to do with a lack of empathy and a lack of an ability to see things from other people's perspectives.

215
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:22,040
Speaker 0: What could help that more than telling someone to play someone else with different motivations?

216
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,740
Speaker 1: I don't think that's what they're doing, though.

217
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,800
Speaker 1: They're probably doing hack and slash D&D, which is miniature's game.

218
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,760
Speaker 0: Even then, even then, it's a constructive, harmless activity that keeps them busy.

219
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:35,380
Speaker 0: They have to do math, they gotta roll dice, they have to deal with failure.

220
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

221
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:38,580
Speaker 1: It's just, you know, the judges have no idea what that is.

222
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,400
Speaker 1: It's just like when judges judge the technology, they don't know what they're talking about.

223
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it bothers me.

224
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,998
Speaker 1: And the lawyers don't go, no lawyer actually, you know, knows enough about D&D.

225
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:56,540
Speaker 1: And the one thing that really upsets me, right, is that, let's say, if I was Hasbro-Watsy, right, that's who's really to blame here.

226
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,560
Speaker 1: Because, I mean, lawyers don't know what D&D is, they're just doing their job.

227
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,979
Speaker 1: The lawyer doesn't know what it is, right?

228
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, why hasn't Hasbro filed an amicus brief?

229
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,640
Speaker 1: Hasbro-Watsy, they gotta go in and gotta be like, "Look, you guys have it all wrong.

230
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,867
Speaker 1: This is what D&D is.

231
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:09,954
Speaker 1: We make D&D.

232
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:10,518
Speaker 1: Here's the

233
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:10,820
Speaker 1: truth.".

234
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,767
Speaker 0: I'd go one step further.

235
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 0: I would try to sue someone under some sort of defamation grounds.

236
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,282
Speaker 1: Possibly.

237
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,140
Speaker 1: I don't know if you can, but not a lawyer.

238
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,244
Speaker 0: I would argue for it.

239
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,899
Speaker 0: I'd make a huge role-playing and prisons campaign.

240
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,840
Speaker 1: If I was Hasbro-Watsy, they definitely have their own lawyers.

241
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,659
Speaker 1: I would definitely be telling them to look into it.

242
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,729
Speaker 0: Plus, maybe not D&D.

243
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,680
Speaker 0: Take some other role-playing.

244
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:41,360
Speaker 0: In fact, I will bet that in the same prisons that have banned D&D, there are support groups and mandatory counseling sessions for maybe violent offenders that encourage role-playing.

245
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,295
Speaker 1: There might be.

246
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:48,620
Speaker 0: It bothers me that the prison system in the US is fucked up anyway.

247
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:57,440
Speaker 0: And on top of that, it's fucked up generally, it's fucked up at its core, it's fucked up at the top, it's fucked up conceptually, and it's fucked up in every individual detail.

248
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,920
Speaker 0: Like, every possible thing that could go wrong is going wrong.

249
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,380
Speaker 1: There are some details that are correct.

250
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:04,208
Speaker 0: A few.

251
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:04,719
Speaker 0: A few.

252
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:08,499
Speaker 0: I mean, we don't just leave people to die in a gutter like they used to.

253
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,189
Speaker 0: I'll save this.

254
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,240
Speaker 0: I got a thing of the day about...

255
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,180
Speaker 1: We let them play basketball.

256
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,279
Speaker 0: I got a thing of the day about a prison... Yeah, but there's a referee.

257
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:17,711
Speaker 0: Gangs.

258
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,292
Speaker 1: I know.

259
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:19,844
Speaker 1: Coach.

260
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:21,239
Speaker 0: Coach.

261
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:24,099
Speaker 0: I just, I can't get over... I picture a player now saying that...

262
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,000
Speaker 1: The coach is the gang leader.

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:34,433
Speaker 0: I picture a Luke Crane kind of gamer trying to run this game for like four hardened, And the guy's like, "He's not getting the sword.

264
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:34,975
Speaker 0: I shiv him.

265
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:35,416
Speaker 0: I shank

266
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:35,557
Speaker 0: him.".

267
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:37,465
Speaker 0: I don't know.

268
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:38,651
Speaker 0: I just have this image.

269
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:40,239
Speaker 0: I feel like college humor should do a skit.

270
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,300
Speaker 1: But yeah, we should definitely send, you know, find one of those prison letter-sending things, and be like, hook them up with the indie RPGs.

271
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,479
Speaker 1: It could become a thing.

272
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,495
Speaker 0: Actually, one step further.

273
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:51,780
Speaker 0: You know what?

274
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:57,080
Speaker 1: And then, in fact, we could design a game, an RPG specifically for people in prison.

275
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,220
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go one step further.

276
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:03,280
Speaker 1: And it could become so popular in the prisons, and then once this game is wicked popular in the prisons...

277
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,320
Speaker 0: It gets banned in the prisons.

278
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,540
Speaker 1: No, you sell it to the public as the game that is popular in prisons nationwide becomes a cool thing, right?

279
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,053
Speaker 1: Or banned in prisons across the US.

280
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:16,640
Speaker 1: Play this game.

281
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,124
Speaker 0: We'll see.

282
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:18,318
Speaker 0: I think what I will do, because...

283
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,717
Speaker 1: And then when those guys come out of prison, they're gonna want to play it with their homies.

284
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,834
Speaker 0: I'm actually a long term shareholder in Hasbro.

285
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,500
Speaker 0: People who aspire to become prisoners.

286
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,480
Speaker 0: I'm gonna write a letter to Hasbro as a shareholder and say, look, you gotta get on this shit.

287
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,360
Speaker 1: And people who aspire to be prisoners will play the game practicing.

288
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,720
Speaker 0: I don't think that many people aspire to be prisoners anymore.

289
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,140
Speaker 1: All the people that are in gangs that aren't in prison.

290
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:46,040
Speaker 0: I don't think that's aspiration so much as the results of a failed shank check.

291
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

292
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:51,720
Speaker 0: Or possibly a successful shank check that was linked into a failed prison check.

293
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Speaker 1: People, you know, thugs who aspire to a life of crime, they will enjoy a game that is, you know, a prison kind of game.

294
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,600
Speaker 1: Maybe we should make a prison role-playing game where you play prisoners in jail.

295
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,447
Speaker 1: And the GM is the guards.

296
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,380
Speaker 1: Or maybe there's guards and prisoners and you do the role-playing game with rules.

297
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,449
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

298
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,810
Speaker 0: It's a college humor, but it's from the vault.

299
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:19,749
Speaker 1: It's always college humor.

300
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:25,130
Speaker 0: It's from the vault, and I wonder if anyone remembers it, but it's something really cool.

301
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,950
Speaker 0: It's not quite skiing, it's not quite hang gliding, it's hang glide skiing or Swiss ski flying.

302
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,290
Speaker 1: A little dangerous?

303
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:35,550
Speaker 0: It looks wicked dangerous.

304
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,690
Speaker 1: And is there a video of a guy doing it?

305
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,990
Speaker 0: There's a video of a guy doing it.

306
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:39,849
Speaker 1: Does he hurt himself?

307
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,127
Speaker 1: Nope.

308
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,535
Speaker 1: What?

309
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:41,910
Speaker 1: There's a video of a guy doing it.

310
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,550
Speaker 1: Who wants to watch anything of the day?

311
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:50,169
Speaker 0: Not only is it a video of a guy doing it, but it's a video from the perspective of the guy following him also doing it.

312
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:55,910
Speaker 0: And I made this my thing of the day because I watched it and it made me make a decision.

313
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,729
Speaker 0: Because I ski, but I'm not a great skier.

314
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,410
Speaker 0: And I ski mostly just for fun.

315
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,990
Speaker 0: I think I've decided to get hardcore.

316
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,809
Speaker 0: I think I've decided to get real lessons and try to become a for real skier.

317
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,869
Speaker 1: So you're going to become a hang gliding skier?

318
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:14,150
Speaker 0: My goal, my literal goal, is to at some point in my life do what is in this video.

319
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,246
Speaker 1: Well, you will die.

320
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,910
Speaker 0: This might be shit talking or death talking.

321
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:18,709
Speaker 1: Death talking.

322
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:22,850
Speaker 0: But I'm going to go for it because I'm young enough to... This is pretty much my last shot.

323
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,230
Speaker 0: If I don't start toward an extreme sport now, it'll never happen.

324
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,550
Speaker 1: There's guys who do the extreme sports when they're older.

325
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got to train now.

326
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,330
Speaker 0: I'm at the last few years where my body might survive a serious injury.

327
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,250
Speaker 1: Call Red Bull.

328
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:38,889
Speaker 1: They'll help you.

329
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,910
Speaker 0: I'll just call Red Bull and be like, "Look, I want to get from what I am now to that.

330
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,042
Speaker 0: Will you sponsor

331
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:44,164
Speaker 0: me?".

332
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:45,869
Speaker 0: And I quit my job and do that.

333
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,070
Speaker 1: And start base jumping.

334
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'm going to do the ski flying.

335
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,410
Speaker 0: It looks less dangerous.

336
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,670
Speaker 1: Maybe less dangerous.

337
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,529
Speaker 0: It does look less dangerous.

338
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,129
Speaker 1: What could be less dangerous than base jumping?

339
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:57,010
Speaker 0: I get this impression.

340
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:59,949
Speaker 1: Base jumping is like the first extreme thing you have to do.

341
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,669
Speaker 0: This is a pretty crazy video.

342
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,210
Speaker 0: No, the first thing is bungee jumping.

343
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,089
Speaker 0: That's the lamest.

344
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,170
Speaker 0: That's like the bottom of the extreme scale.

345
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:06,984
Speaker 1: Whatever.

346
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:08,178
Speaker 1: Same shit.

347
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,369
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

348
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,877
Speaker 1: So somebody made this thing.

349
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,565
Speaker 1: that is sort of an idea.

350
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:15,930
Speaker 1: that's sort of obvious, right?

351
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,770
Speaker 1: But they actually did it, which puts them on top.

352
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,769
Speaker 1: And also they found a way to do it on the way cheap.

353
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:23,449
Speaker 1: What they did is they made a thing called the pirate box.

354
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,469
Speaker 0: Is it full of gold?

355
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,244
Speaker 1: I wish.

356
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,664
Speaker 1: You go on Amazon.

357
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,190
Speaker 0: The Leprechaun universe is well and good.

358
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,050
Speaker 1: That's right.

359
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,469
Speaker 1: You have them in the pirate universe.

360
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:39,430
Speaker 1: So you buy a pirate lunchbox on Amazon, right?

361
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:44,029
Speaker 1: And then you buy a little wireless router thingy.

362
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,730
Speaker 1: You know, a little network card business.

363
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,769
Speaker 1: And you buy a little USB stick.

364
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,750
Speaker 1: And you buy, where's the list of stuff?

365
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:52,070
Speaker 1: You don't have to buy that much.

366
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:54,290
Speaker 1: It comes out to less than $100.

367
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,529
Speaker 0: So then I get a lunchbox with a pirate logo on it and some tech inside of it.

368
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,310
Speaker 1: And basically what happens is it's a wireless access point.

369
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,930
Speaker 1: It even has its own internal power.

370
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:03,509
Speaker 1: You buy a USB battery pack thing.

371
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,909
Speaker 1: And so then anyone who searches for wireless networks will see pirate box.

372
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:11,010
Speaker 1: And if they connect, right, this thing's running Linux.

373
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:15,910
Speaker 1: So what will happen is any website they try to go to, the website won't be there because there's no internet connection.

374
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,510
Speaker 1: It's just you connect it to a box in a lunch pail.

375
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,528
Speaker 1: And what you'll see is you'll see pirate box.

376
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:26,364
Speaker 1: And what the pirate box is is you just can upload files to it and download files from it.

377
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,370
Speaker 0: I'm surprised no one made a commodity version of this sooner.

378
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:34,050
Speaker 1: You didn't actually make a commodity version of it.

379
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,470
Speaker 1: You had to make your own by those instructions.

380
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,210
Speaker 0: Well, it can be made with commodity materials.

381
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,269
Speaker 0: Nerds can just make one and throw it out there.

382
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:39,415
Speaker 1: Yep.

383
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,207
Speaker 0: I like this idea a lot.

384
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,510
Speaker 0: I feel like I should make one.

385
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:45,970
Speaker 1: I'm going to make one because we got conventions coming up real soon.

386
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,186
Speaker 1: Yeah.

387
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:46,950
Speaker 1: We're going to need it.

388
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,887
Speaker 0: We should know what we'll do.

389
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:57,850
Speaker 0: We'll bring it to every panel we do, point out its existence in the pre-talk before we actually do the panel, and just say, "Hey, anyone wants to put anything on here?

390
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,138
Speaker 0: You got a

391
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:58,549
Speaker 0: question?".

392
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,530
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's the things you need.

393
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,590
Speaker 1: You need a free agent doc star.

394
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:04,970
Speaker 1: You can also use a Go Flex or a Pogo plug, okay?

395
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:08,690
Speaker 1: You can use an Asus wireless router.

396
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:09,889
Speaker 0: Scott, I got it.

397
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:10,768
Speaker 0: This is what we'll do.

398
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,190
Speaker 1: A USB flash drive.

399
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:12,809
Speaker 0: Scott, I got it.

400
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,750
Speaker 1: A pirate lunch box.

401
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,828
Speaker 0: Let's both build one, right?

402
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:15,908
Speaker 1: Yes, we have two.

403
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,490
Speaker 0: And then once we've got them going, we will start a contest.

404
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,070
Speaker 0: Six months later, whoever has gotten the coolest thing uploaded onto theirs by someone other than themselves wins.

405
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,685
Speaker 1: Let's go for it.

406
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,649
Speaker 1: And then a rechargeable battery pack.

407
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:30,970
Speaker 0: I'm all about this.

408
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:31,869
Speaker 0: I don't know.

409
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,458
Speaker 0: I'm not going to get into my whole.

410
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,590
Speaker 0: someday we'll have ubiquitous wireless internet.

411
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,810
Speaker 0: that then leads to some sort of cultural revolution.

412
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:40,070
Speaker 1: No, but the thing is, I think this is step one, right?

413
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,310
Speaker 1: For under 100 bucks, you can make one of these.

414
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:46,090
Speaker 1: The next step is to find a way to get some mesh networking going on with these.

415
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, where a pirate box finds another pirate box.

416
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:55,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, where the pirate boxes network with each other, and then you connect to one pirate box, and then you can request files.

417
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,470
Speaker 1: It'll be sort of like libraries.

418
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,329
Speaker 1: You can request a file from another pirate box.

419
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:04,090
Speaker 0: The third step would be if you could make a double pirate box that also gets an internet connection from somewhere.

420
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,890
Speaker 1: I think the point is that you don't want an internet connection because you want to make sure it's anonymous.

421
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:10,619
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but you could make another one.

422
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:20,389
Speaker 0: that is basically you'd run a pirate node that a pirate box could connect to, and then people could tunnel through and do their nefarious evil deed, and then there's no record of how they got there.

423
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:21,602
Speaker 0: Because they ad hoc.

424
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,250
Speaker 0: They basically are behind seven pirate boxes.

425
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:25,769
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess.

426
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,748
Speaker 1: Whatever, but yeah, I'm going to make one of these guys.

427
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,010
Speaker 0: So, very briefly, the meta moment.

428
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,553
Speaker 0: We were at MAGFest 9.

429
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:34,970
Speaker 1: It's over.

430
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:41,270
Speaker 0: If you were at MAGFest and you did not fill out the MAGFest 9 panel survey, you should do this honestly.

431
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:53,370
Speaker 0: We will go back to MAGFest if they invite us and pay for us like they did this time, and if no disaster happens between now and then, like MAGFest collapses or it's on the same week as PAX or something.

432
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,050
Speaker 1: Next upcoming convention is PAX East.

433
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,590
Speaker 1: Followed the week following is Zenkai Con.

434
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,970
Speaker 0: So PAX East, we are doing not one, not two, but daddy three panels.

435
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,050
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, three hard whirling panels.

436
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,750
Speaker 0: And our friends are doing a whole shit ton of panels.

437
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,030
Speaker 0: There is going to be this network of Geek Nights and Friends panels.

438
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,649
Speaker 0: You could basically plot a course through PAX.

439
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,150
Speaker 1: We're going to have to make a Geek Nights suggested programming list.

440
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:19,733
Speaker 1: Yes.

441
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:20,989
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, yes.

442
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,330
Speaker 0: But we are doing the triple threat, which is three short subjects in gaming.

443
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,910
Speaker 0: It's basically three 20-minute panels in one panel.

444
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,190
Speaker 0: Like bam, bam, bam.

445
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,390
Speaker 1: That have nothing to do with each other.

446
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,070
Speaker 1: We're not going to wrap them up or sum them together or anything like that.

447
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,190
Speaker 0: We're going to start the panel like it's a brand new panel.

448
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,650
Speaker 0: Stop it, pause, start another panel.

449
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:38,710
Speaker 0: It's going to be awesome.

450
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,250
Speaker 0: We're doing game mechanics and mechanism design again by popular demand.

451
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,810
Speaker 1: We only did it once at PAX West.

452
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,870
Speaker 0: And it's our best panel, hands down right now.

453
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,409
Speaker 1: And now it's PAX East.

454
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:48,710
Speaker 1: Who made that panel?

455
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:49,790
Speaker 0: Scott made that panel.

456
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,930
Speaker 1: That's right, Scott makes the best panel.

457
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:59,410
Speaker 0: And we're doing a brand new panel, one of my panels, totally brand new, we'll see how it goes, called Playing Games to Win or Winning Games.

458
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,950
Speaker 1: You should just call it Playing to Win the Game.

459
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,350
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what it's called.

460
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,310
Speaker 0: I got to look in the schedule.

461
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,510
Speaker 0: But basically it's the, you play to win the game panel.

462
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:06,870
Speaker 1: That's right.

463
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:08,407
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to that one too.

464
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,148
Speaker 1: That's going to be good.

465
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,410
Speaker 0: Luke and Jared are doing some stuff.

466
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,308
Speaker 0: Going to be all up ins.

467
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,429
Speaker 1: Yep, lots of people.

468
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:14,829
Speaker 1: Anyway, also other news is.

469
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,810
Speaker 0: February 11th, upcoming Friday, there's a Nerd NYC board game night.

470
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,950
Speaker 0: There is also a Nerd night in Brooklyn.

471
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:27,870
Speaker 0: And we might go to that instead of the board game night because once we go to one of those, we already set it up.

472
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,910
Speaker 0: We're probably going to run some of our Geek Nights panels, shortened versions of them, at an upcoming Nerd night.

473
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're trying to do a lot more New York kind of stuff, you know?

474
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:47,810
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you do anything and have a venue in the New York greater metropolitan area and you want Geek Nights, Raymond Scott, named Scott, to do a live show, email us, geeknightsatfrontrecoup.com.

475
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,990
Speaker 0: I'm not guaranteeing we'll come, but we will at least consider it.

476
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,045
Speaker 1: The book club selection is...

477
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,910
Speaker 0: Michio Kaku's Hyperspace.

478
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:56,849
Speaker 0: I'm about three quarters of the way through it.

479
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:03,990
Speaker 1: I also want to remember in the meta moment to mention you should go to frontrecruit.com, which is our website.

480
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,418
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't go there.

481
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:06,164
Speaker 1: Ever.

482
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:06,910
Speaker 1: You should.

483
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:09,830
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't follow us on Twitter.

484
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,878
Speaker 1: You can follow Geek Nights.

485
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,190
Speaker 1: You can follow me personally.

486
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,290
Speaker 1: You can follow Rym personally.

487
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,870
Speaker 0: We tweet out everything of the day.

488
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:22,371
Speaker 0: We also tweet out old episodes that you might have missed because the RSS feed only goes back like 100 episodes and we've been doing this shit since 2005.

489
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:23,516
Speaker 1: Yep.

490
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:26,890
Speaker 1: You can go to our forum, which you can get to from the website.

491
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,950
Speaker 0: Our forum is one of the best and least shit-cockery-filled forums on the entire internet.

492
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,950
Speaker 1: The forum has had a lot of new users lately and also some increased activity.

493
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,175
Speaker 1: Make sure when you apply to the forum that you type in in the box that says, "Why are you

494
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:38,517
Speaker 1: joining?".

495
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:40,450
Speaker 1: Just type in some actual English words.

496
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,289
Speaker 0: You have to prove that you're not a robot.

497
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,929
Speaker 0: I've denied a lot of people who were actually people.

498
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not going to use a captcha.

499
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:48,538
Speaker 0: You have to pass a Turing test.

500
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:50,870
Speaker 0: You've got one paragraph to pass a Turing test.

501
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:58,350
Speaker 1: You can write as little as one word, but you have to make sure that's a damn good word that proves that you're actually-- I think the cockboat would suffice.

502
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:07,249
Speaker 1: Remember, whatever you write in there, I am reading with my eyeballs or Rym is reading it, and if we are convinced based on that that you are a human, then we will say yes.

503
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:11,549
Speaker 1: It doesn't take much, but if you write something like, "I wanna," that's not enough.

504
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,058
Speaker 1: You have to write something like, "I'm a Geek Nights listener and I want to join the

505
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:16,400
Speaker 1: forum.".

506
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,006
Speaker 1: That would suffice.

507
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,430
Speaker 0: We're at the Five Napkin Burger, which opened up recently in Queens.

508
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,870
Speaker 0: It's a chain, but it's a good burger.

509
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,289
Speaker 0: I remembered how much I fucking love burgers.

510
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:32,423
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, we always don't want to do a food show because it's sort of like the zombie show.

511
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:33,109
Speaker 1: It's so requested.

512
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:39,590
Speaker 1: I hate doing it, but the burger is perhaps the most important food in the United States, where we live.

513
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,630
Speaker 0: Let alone in New York City, where the burger joint is like this stanchion of society.

514
00:24:44,670 --> 00:25:06,790
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, New York, I guess, is still mostly known for its pizza, but I think because the burger was mostly relegated to fast food and also to barbecues in the summer, that more recently people have been able to make a lot of money by coming out with burger restaurants that serve high-quality burgers.

515
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,750
Speaker 1: Because you can get a high-quality burger.

516
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:12,030
Speaker 0: You can go to a Stuff on the Wall's place and get an okay burger.

517
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,410
Speaker 0: A lot of steak houses have really awesome burgers.

518
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:25,010
Speaker 1: But in recent years, the quality burger place, it's like fast food because you get a burger fast, but it's not actually a fast food piece of shit McDonald's burger.

519
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,730
Speaker 1: It's a real serious burger.

520
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:34,110
Speaker 1: It's become very popular, and in New York City, it's become so popular that there are so many choices in competing places that it's like a thing.

521
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:41,150
Speaker 1: Even Nerd NYC has a Nerd Burger event, where they go to a different burger place all the time to try them all out.

522
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:46,610
Speaker 0: A lot of people call us out and try to say that we're too harsh on Five Guys.

523
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,750
Speaker 0: They're like, "What do you mean you don't like Five Guys?

524
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,820
Speaker 0: Five Guys sucks

525
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,346
Speaker 0: balls.".

526
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,189
Speaker 1: Five Guys doesn't suck balls.

527
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,209
Speaker 0: I'm going to qualify that.

528
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:56,549
Speaker 0: Five Guys sucks balls, but there's an asterisk.

529
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:02,730
Speaker 0: Because we live in New York, Five Guys is like the bottom of the non-fast food burger.

530
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:03,568
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

531
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:07,898
Speaker 1: Compared to, say, McDonald's or any fast food place-- Those aren't burgers.

532
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,050
Speaker 0: That's like saying Taco Bell's a taco.

533
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:09,710
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

534
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,450
Speaker 1: Five Guys is better than all those by a lot.

535
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:22,170
Speaker 1: If you're in a suburb somewhere, and there aren't a million awesome burger places like New York City, Five Guys is probably way better than anything you're going to get other than your backyard.

536
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:27,050
Speaker 1: It's probably even better than what you're going to get at TGI Fridays or stuff on the walls.

537
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:27,449
Speaker 1: It's okay.

538
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,590
Speaker 0: Five Guys is the same level as a Bill Gray's burger.

539
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:34,090
Speaker 1: The thing I don't like about Five Guys is the default double burger.

540
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,330
Speaker 0: The thin little burger.

541
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,589
Speaker 1: The burger itself, even if you get double, is like this thin little sad kind of guy.

542
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,630
Speaker 0: That crappy McDonald's feeling bun.

543
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,051
Speaker 0: Yeah.

544
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,929
Speaker 1: I mean, the bun is not the greatest bun.

545
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:47,770
Speaker 1: The french fries, they're all right.

546
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,110
Speaker 1: They're okay.

547
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,310
Speaker 1: And the peanut stick with the peanut oil stick.

548
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:50,819
Speaker 1: I can do--.

549
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,690
Speaker 0: However, I do not have enough non-okay french fry potato options.

550
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:57,589
Speaker 0: I need more carbohydrates at that place.

551
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:04,670
Speaker 1: Five Guys, if you want to beat out all-- It's basically the bottom of satisfactory.

552
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,610
Speaker 0: Well, I would say it's the bottom of still a burger.

553
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:15,590
Speaker 0: I mean, we got the Five Napkin right here, which I had never actually eaten at one before, and I'm recently very impressed with it.

554
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,790
Speaker 1: Well, Five Napkin, right?

555
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,930
Speaker 1: I mean, this is the thing, right?

556
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:24,609
Speaker 1: Is it really fair to compare a burger at a sit-down restaurant to a burger that you can take out?

557
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:33,189
Speaker 1: Because it's like, well, you know, I mean, they could, Five Napkin could make that same burger if you waited there to make it because they actually made it real fast.

558
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,069
Speaker 1: It came out right away and let you take it out with you.

559
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:37,328
Speaker 1: They could do that.

560
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,410
Speaker 0: By the same token, Capital Grill sometimes has burgers.

561
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,821
Speaker 0: Is that going to compete?

562
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:42,529
Speaker 0: I mean, is that fair?

563
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:52,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it's fair to compare a place that is a takeout specific place, you know, that might have a few tables for lunch people versus a place where it's only weight service.

564
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,669
Speaker 0: All right, so let's do just takeout then right now.

565
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,702
Speaker 1: All right, so just takeout?

566
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:56,130
Speaker 0: All right.

567
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:08,090
Speaker 0: Also, what kind of brought the interest back is Luke Burrage, our awesome courage Burrage juggling friend, was in the city for a while just hanging out, and he went on a quest to find the best kind of just burger joint in New York.

568
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,050
Speaker 0: He ate like every goddamn burger and everyone gave him recommendations.

569
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,030
Speaker 1: Well, not every, but he did eat a lot.

570
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,049
Speaker 0: I'm proud to say that my recommendation won.

571
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,830
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the thing, snippers, right?

572
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,330
Speaker 1: So let's look at snippers for a second.

573
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:21,888
Speaker 1: So snippers, you can get a takeout there, right?

574
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,703
Speaker 1: But it's not quite fast food takeout.

575
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,889
Speaker 1: You can sit at a table and put a little number up and they'll bring your burger to your table.

576
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:33,950
Speaker 0: Like it's a step down, but barely a step down from Five Napkin.

577
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this in-between kind of situation.

578
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:41,790
Speaker 1: It's not a sit down with weight service, but you can sit down there and they'll bring your burger to you.

579
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:51,690
Speaker 1: It's almost like the difference between McDonald's drive through and it's more akin to the '50s where you'd pull your car up and then a girl with roller skates would bring it to you.

580
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,486
Speaker 0: Oh, man, that reminds me, when I was a kid in Michigan, right, we still had A&W's.

581
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:02,050
Speaker 0: You basically go in, they had to drive through, they had the roller skating waitresses and everything.

582
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are places like that still out there, just as many as there are driving through movie theaters.

583
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,410
Speaker 0: And you get a shitty-ass burger, the crappiest fries in the world, and a pretty damn good root beer float.

584
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can't mess up the root beer float.

585
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,329
Speaker 1: It's A&W, they make root beer, that's what they do.

586
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,470
Speaker 0: Granted, the root beer is high fructose corn syrup in here now.

587
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:19,110
Speaker 0: Of course.

588
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,289
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was when I was a kid or not.

589
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:22,590
Speaker 0: I don't know if I knew better.

590
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,710
Speaker 1: But do you think they're still using that corn syrup at the actual place?

591
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,329
Speaker 1: Probably.

592
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:27,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, whatever.

593
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:28,224
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:31,147
Speaker 0: Oh, man, I miss those days hanging out at the A&W.

595
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,448
Speaker 0: Those are some shit burgers, let me tell you.

596
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,930
Speaker 1: But I mean, you've also got places in New York, now you get the burger trucks, right?

597
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,490
Speaker 1: And you've also got places that aren't specifically burger places.

598
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,570
Speaker 1: They're like generic deli.

599
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,590
Speaker 1: You can go in any generic deli place and ask for a burger.

600
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,650
Speaker 0: I'll make an okay burger.

601
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,290
Speaker 1: You can get one, and it's actually pretty cheap, usually a good deal.

602
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,530
Speaker 0: Way better than the default burger at a generic diner.

603
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,329
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

604
00:29:55,176 --> 00:30:03,010
Speaker 1: So it's like you just go in a generic deli place that makes breakfast sandwiches and Boar's Head subs and everything and ask for a burger, and it'll be not bad.

605
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,128
Speaker 1: I've had it plenty of times.

606
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:10,329
Speaker 0: I've got to agree with the Luke Burge, though, that the Schnippers is the best kind of takeout-y burger there is in New York, at least.

607
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,189
Speaker 0: Like, it's the best one I've ever had.

608
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:19,109
Speaker 1: That you haven't had from this one truck, though, that I've been... I mean, the thing is, there are so many burger trucks, and I'm pretty sure some of them might be better than this one that I go to.

609
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,790
Speaker 0: There's one that was by Brian Park, like, a couple weeks ago.

610
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:22,749
Speaker 0: that was pretty damn good.

611
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:23,669
Speaker 1: Which one was it?

612
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:24,435
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

613
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,068
Speaker 0: It was just a burger truck, and I was like, "Damn, I got a

614
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:26,249
Speaker 0: burger.".

615
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:27,161
Speaker 1: What did it say?

616
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:27,709
Speaker 1: What did it look like?

617
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,217
Speaker 1: I don't know.

618
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:28,950
Speaker 0: It was a burger truck.

619
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,590
Speaker 1: You don't even remember the name of it or what the truck looked like?

620
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:32,248
Speaker 1: What color was it?

621
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:35,070
Speaker 0: It was red, and it was one of those driving, like, the whole truck.

622
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,817
Speaker 0: It wasn't a cart.

623
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:37,150
Speaker 0: It was a proper big-ass truck.

624
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:37,950
Speaker 1: That's what I'm talking about.

625
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,630
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, the one that I go to is called Frites and Meats, right?

626
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:44,049
Speaker 1: And, you know, their meats are excellent meats.

627
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,248
Speaker 1: Very excellent meats.

628
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:45,929
Speaker 0: How about the Frites?

629
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:48,310
Speaker 1: The Frites are actually not that great.

630
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,730
Speaker 1: I'm not a big fan of the Frites, but...

631
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:50,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of places fuck that up.

632
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,990
Speaker 0: Like Good Burger has great burgers, crappy buns, and their fries are like McDonald's fries.

633
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,010
Speaker 1: So here's the thing right there.

634
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,870
Speaker 1: Buns are these unbelievable buns they get from, like, a fancy bakery downtown.

635
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,267
Speaker 1: Unbelievable.

636
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,605
Speaker 1: You get, like, the potato onion or the brioche.

637
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:04,290
Speaker 1: Oh, snap.

638
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:04,873
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

639
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:06,350
Speaker 0: Brioche burger is almost unfair.

640
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,310
Speaker 1: So then the cheese they get from the famous Murray's cheeses.

641
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,050
Speaker 1: You can get the Gruyere or whatever fancy cheese you want.

642
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,219
Speaker 0: What's with Gruyere?

643
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,349
Speaker 0: Like, coming up.

644
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,050
Speaker 1: It's popular lately.

645
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,430
Speaker 0: It's like the rising star of cheeses.

646
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:16,751
Speaker 1: I know.

647
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:19,970
Speaker 1: I would have invested in a Gruyere dairy farm if I would have known.

648
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:25,930
Speaker 1: But, yeah, so they got, you know, awesome meats, awesome buns, awesome cheeses, right?

649
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,847
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's a little expensive, you know, for just a burger, right?

650
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,009
Speaker 0: Well, how expensive?

651
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,237
Speaker 1: Like eight, nine bucks.

652
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:33,030
Speaker 0: It's a good burger price.

653
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,490
Speaker 1: And the Frites are not, you know, they're not bad, but they're not amazing.

654
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,090
Speaker 1: They need to be a little more potato-y because, you know, they're actually Frites.

655
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,390
Speaker 1: They're not French fries, right?

656
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,308
Speaker 1: But the thing is, they give you these... You can get a little sauce for your Frites, 50 Cent.

657
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,230
Speaker 0: See, it's hard to impress me with that, though, because I can go full on and get poutine.

658
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:50,516
Speaker 1: Ah, shit.

659
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:51,368
Speaker 1: Where are you going to get it from?

660
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,171
Speaker 0: St.

661
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:52,494
Speaker 0: Mark's.

662
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:54,310
Speaker 0: There's like 10 poutine places right around there.

663
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not near your work.

664
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,720
Speaker 0: No, not near my work.

665
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,465
Speaker 0: Nothing.

666
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:58,010
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

667
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:03,450
Speaker 1: They got this, like, garlic aioli you can get for your Frites or sun-dried tomato.

668
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,988
Speaker 0: The only thing I want more than some poutine in Midtown is a fucking Davella's.

669
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:09,675
Speaker 1: Davella's.

670
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:10,450
Speaker 1: We need that big day.

671
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,630
Speaker 1: But, yeah, so, like, there are some people that are just really kicking it out there.

672
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,295
Speaker 0: So, what's your burger?

673
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:15,962
Speaker 0: Like, what's your burger?

674
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,169
Speaker 0: Like, your go-to burger.

675
00:32:18,474 --> 00:32:19,063
Speaker 1: Go-to?

676
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:19,470
Speaker 1: Yeah.

677
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,293
Speaker 1: I don't know.

678
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:22,043
Speaker 1: I just... I don't really have a go-to burger.

679
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:23,070
Speaker 1: I get whatever I'm in the mood.

680
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:24,869
Speaker 1: I change my mood all the time.

681
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:30,730
Speaker 1: The main things that I care about, right, in terms of quality are how the bun holds up, right?

682
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,250
Speaker 1: Because I'm holding on to the bun to eat the burger, right?

683
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:39,110
Speaker 1: And if the bun doesn't become all soggy, you know, then it greatly, greatly enhances the burger eating experience.

684
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:41,310
Speaker 0: That's my main complaint, other than the fries with Good Burger.

685
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:44,104
Speaker 0: The bun basically, like, squeezes the burger out of it.

686
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:45,290
Speaker 0: Like, you touch it and it falls apart.

687
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:45,852
Speaker 0: Yeah.

688
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:55,010
Speaker 1: So, you got to have a solid bun that holds the burger inside, because then the whole eating experience, I don't get my hands all greasy, and, oh, it becomes so much better, because then I'm able to eat it properly.

689
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:55,911
Speaker 1: Of course.

690
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,599
Speaker 0: I have found I like really messy burgers.

691
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,290
Speaker 0: Like, I kind of like things like pizza burgers, sloppy joes.

692
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,062
Speaker 1: I don't know if I like a pizza burger so much.

693
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:05,050
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess it's all right.

694
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:12,830
Speaker 0: The thing is, most pizza burgers are shit, because they're either high school cafeteria tier, or they're at a diner where they're just a normal burger with some marinara.

695
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,441
Speaker 0: But a proper messy burger, you've got to eat it.

696
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:22,200
Speaker 0: You've basically got to go into that burger saying, "I am not going to wipe off my face or hands until I'm done.

697
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:25,148
Speaker 0: I am going to eat this, and I don't give a

698
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:25,409
Speaker 0: shit.".

699
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,781
Speaker 0: Then you can enjoy it, but only then.

700
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:29,430
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you're going to go bite.

701
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,301
Speaker 0: Napkin, napkin, napkin, napkin, napkin.

702
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:32,570
Speaker 0: Bite, napkin, napkin, napkin.

703
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,750
Speaker 0: You're going to whip out the knife and the fork, and it's not going to be a good time.

704
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,463
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, I like to go sometimes for just lettuce, tomato, onion.

705
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:40,825
Speaker 1: That's it.

706
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:41,970
Speaker 1: I like the onion.

707
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,695
Speaker 0: I like the pickle.

708
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,184
Speaker 1: I don't like the pickle.

709
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:45,010
Speaker 1: I'm not a pickle fan.

710
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,849
Speaker 0: It's very rare I'll get a burger without a pickle.

711
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,574
Speaker 1: I don't like pickle.

712
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:52,070
Speaker 1: I mean, I like pickles, but I only like certain kinds of pickles, which is usually not the kind that put in a burger.

713
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:52,890
Speaker 0: I like the pickle.

714
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,402
Speaker 1: Pickle on the burger doesn't make it good.

715
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:55,006
Speaker 1: It makes it worse.

716
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:55,490
Speaker 1: It's no good.

717
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:02,310
Speaker 0: I think my favorite, of all the burgers I've ever eaten, other than the burgers Lisa made that one time at James' house back at RIT.

718
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,516
Speaker 0: Oh my God, those burgers.

719
00:34:04,596 --> 00:34:07,290
Speaker 0: Was that Banya burger down in Wildwood.

720
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:08,429
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

721
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:09,730
Speaker 0: That Banya burger is so good.

722
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:09,971
Speaker 0: I forgot.

723
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:12,464
Speaker 1: I wasn't even thinking about the freaking alumni grill.

724
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,429
Speaker 1: I don't know if that can be beat.

725
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,810
Speaker 0: Because the Banya burger.

726
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,550
Speaker 1: I think alumni grill might be best ever.

727
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,630
Speaker 0: We brought this up on Geek Nights a couple of times.

728
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:26,350
Speaker 0: It is a thick burger on a good bun, and it has got this kind of like green pepper jalapeno sauce and cheese.

729
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,636
Speaker 0: But no, no, no, no, no.

730
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:28,583
Speaker 0: It's not just cheese.

731
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:29,510
Speaker 0: Cheese sticks.

732
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,030
Speaker 0: It's fried cheese sticks in the place of cheese.

733
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:34,389
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

734
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,969
Speaker 1: Like, alumni grill, their meat isn't the best meat in the universe.

735
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:39,543
Speaker 1: And their bun isn't the best bun in the universe.

736
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:40,206
Speaker 1: But it's good.

737
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:40,750
Speaker 1: It's real good.

738
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,110
Speaker 0: The closest thing I've ever had to that is there's this one chili sauce burger at Schnippers.

739
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,969
Speaker 0: Other than the fact that it doesn't have cheese sticks, it is basically that burger.

740
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,130
Speaker 1: But the thing is, one of the burgers that I like to go for is the barbecue burger.

741
00:34:55,391 --> 00:35:00,230
Speaker 1: And they got the barbecue burger, but it's half chicken, half burger in the same sandwich.

742
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,069
Speaker 1: That's too much.

743
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,219
Speaker 1: It's the best.

744
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:03,170
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so good.

745
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:07,410
Speaker 0: Usually the barbecue burger, I'm leery of, but then again, I usually get it.

746
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:08,510
Speaker 1: Why would you be leery?

747
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,729
Speaker 0: Because I always get it like a diner.

748
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,210
Speaker 1: Get some bacon and barbecue in there?

749
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always bacon, barbecue, and A1 or some BS like that.

750
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,637
Speaker 1: No, no, A1.

751
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,589
Speaker 1: Actual barbecue sauce.

752
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:15,925
Speaker 1: Yeah.

753
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:16,709
Speaker 1: You get in there.

754
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,984
Speaker 0: Of course, if you're going to get the barbecue, go one step further.

755
00:35:19,004 --> 00:35:19,810
Speaker 0: Get the Wooster Burger.

756
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:21,109
Speaker 1: No, not really.

757
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,170
Speaker 0: I like the Wooster Burger.

758
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,150
Speaker 1: I'm not a big fan of Wooster's.

759
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,910
Speaker 0: Not a fan of mushrooms unless it's a big portabella.

760
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:31,610
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, if it's a portabella, that replaces the burger.

761
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I don't like a burger that has like chopped mushrooms on it.

762
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:35,789
Speaker 1: No, not really.

763
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,110
Speaker 1: But a burger that is- I like mushrooms, just not a burger.

764
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,190
Speaker 0: But a burger that is a beef patty and then a portabella.

765
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,229
Speaker 0: Ah, ah, ah.

766
00:35:44,312 --> 00:35:46,470
Speaker 1: No, you got to have just- You got to go double.

767
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,270
Speaker 1: If you got the big mushroom, you don't have the burgers out.

768
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:49,665
Speaker 1: Double.

769
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,349
Speaker 1: It replaces the meat.

770
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,769
Speaker 0: It's basically a double decker.

771
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:53,850
Speaker 1: No, I don't like a double decker.

772
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,649
Speaker 0: I like a double decker.

773
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,309
Speaker 1: No, two meats is too much meats.

774
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,130
Speaker 0: Because I like the patty melt.

775
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:57,770
Speaker 0: It's weird though.

776
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,810
Speaker 0: Or the patty melt club.

777
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,770
Speaker 1: It's weird though, right?

778
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,329
Speaker 1: See, here's the thing with the meats, right?

779
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:04,490
Speaker 1: If you actually get two burgers on there, even if they're small, right?

780
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,945
Speaker 1: So let's say you get two quarter pounders on the same bun, right?

781
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,410
Speaker 0: You get that extra half bun in the middle.

782
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,270
Speaker 1: Well, no.

783
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:13,070
Speaker 1: Even if there's no half bun in the middle, it doesn't matter.

784
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,690
Speaker 1: So you get two quarter pounders in there, right?

785
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,170
Speaker 1: The thing is, there's outside burger and inside burger.

786
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,030
Speaker 1: So really, you're doubling the surface area.

787
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:23,029
Speaker 1: So the outside charred part of the burger, you're getting a lot more of.

788
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:24,950
Speaker 1: And the inside part, you're getting a lot less of.

789
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,650
Speaker 1: So a double burger with two quarter pounders, I just can't even eat that.

790
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,730
Speaker 1: But, if you give me a single half pounder, right?

791
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,090
Speaker 1: That, I can go for.

792
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,590
Speaker 1: I can even do a single, well, maybe not three quarters of a pound, right?

793
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,110
Speaker 1: I mean, Fuddruckers has the one pounder, right?

794
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,130
Speaker 0: I ate a one pounder once.

795
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:41,869
Speaker 1: At Fuddruckers?

796
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,310
Speaker 1: The big thing that's as big as a personal pizza.

797
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:45,750
Speaker 0: I ate a one pound burger.

798
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:47,030
Speaker 0: And I was just fine.

799
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,850
Speaker 0: I was just fine.

800
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,187
Speaker 0: However.

801
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:49,229
Speaker 1: You didn't eat anything else?

802
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,670
Speaker 0: However, I was in high school when I could pull shit like that off.

803
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:59,409
Speaker 0: I mean, I think I've recounted the famous story where me and my friends were kicked out of a pizza hut for abusing the all you can eat buffet.

804
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,070
Speaker 1: Yeah.

805
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:01,528
Speaker 1: But, yeah.

806
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,290
Speaker 1: So, it's like, you know, because the half pound burger, right?

807
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:05,369
Speaker 1: Cooked properly.

808
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:08,910
Speaker 1: You know, the outside will be charred, the inside will be all juicy.

809
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:10,930
Speaker 1: So, it's not like you're eating a double burger.

810
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:12,409
Speaker 1: So, I can actually, I can stomach that.

811
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,030
Speaker 0: I don't know.

812
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,430
Speaker 1: My favorite burger recently, though.

813
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,970
Speaker 1: Plus, too much charred food is going to give you pancreatic cancer.

814
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:17,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

815
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:21,369
Speaker 0: I'm willing to put up with that risk.

816
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:21,890
Speaker 0: Alright.

817
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,649
Speaker 0: Kind of like how I occasionally still eat cooked sprouts.

818
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,290
Speaker 0: Even though I know it's dangerous.

819
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,010
Speaker 0: But every time I eat it now, I think.

820
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,870
Speaker 0: I think I'm basically skiing down a double black mountain of sprouts.

821
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:34,589
Speaker 0: Am I okay with this?

822
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,222
Speaker 1: Kind of.

823
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:36,390
Speaker 1: Kind of.

824
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:36,827
Speaker 1: Kind of.

825
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,150
Speaker 1: You're going to hang glide off the double black mountain.

826
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,750
Speaker 0: That's why I'm eating sprouts again.

827
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:46,250
Speaker 0: Because if I'm going to risk my life doing dangerous shit, sprouts can't be more dangerous than a double black diamond.

828
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,010
Speaker 1: Yes, they are.

829
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,508
Speaker 0: Depends.

830
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,230
Speaker 1: You'll die instantly.

831
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:48,948
Speaker 0: Pete will jump in.

832
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:49,524
Speaker 0: He'll yell at me.

833
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:52,509
Speaker 0: But, that five napkins.

834
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:56,590
Speaker 0: I'm worried because it's closer to my apartment than I thought.

835
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,050
Speaker 0: And it's also next to the movie theater.

836
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:01,109
Speaker 0: And they have this root beer.

837
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,310
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually like a ginger ale rum float.

838
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,190
Speaker 1: They actually serve the milkshake properly there.

839
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, with the malt thing.

840
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,809
Speaker 1: What do you mean malt thing?

841
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:09,910
Speaker 0: I used to go to malt shops when I was a kid.

842
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,410
Speaker 0: And the malt shops would bring you the milkshake in the shaker.

843
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:15,309
Speaker 1: That's what you call the shaker?

844
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:16,049
Speaker 1: It's a metal cup.

845
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, they called it the malt cup because they made malts in the malt cup.

846
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:22,790
Speaker 0: If you got a shake as opposed to a malt, they made it in a regular blender.

847
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,250
Speaker 0: If you got a malt, they made it in the milkshake blender.

848
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:26,809
Speaker 0: They called it the malter.

849
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,129
Speaker 0: Anyway, they bring you that cup.

850
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, when you make anyone who buys a milkshake machine, it's this little thing that comes with mixers and these metal cups.

851
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:46,170
Speaker 1: And when you get a milkshake, they're supposed to give you the metal cup, pour a glass full of milkshake and leave the remaining, because the metal cup holds like 36, some ridiculous number of ounces.

852
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:46,933
Speaker 1: Right?

853
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:51,830
Speaker 1: So they're supposed to leave the metal cup on your table so you can refill your milkshake glass.

854
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,801
Speaker 1: But a lot of places don't do that.

855
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:54,950
Speaker 1: They're cheap asses.

856
00:38:55,351 --> 00:39:01,250
Speaker 1: And they just fill a little glass, probably a tapered glass, with like 16 ounces of milkshake, and that's all you get.

857
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,030
Speaker 0: Which is fine because I don't need that much milkshake.

858
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:03,989
Speaker 1: No, I need the whole thing.

859
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,810
Speaker 0: I don't need the whole thing.

860
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,949
Speaker 1: No, I'm paying for that because I'll charge you the same amount.

861
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:12,230
Speaker 0: I will pay more for less because I just want some milkshake.

862
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,987
Speaker 0: No, I want the whole fucking milkshake.

863
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,350
Speaker 1: No, it's exactly the right amount.

864
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,050
Speaker 0: Way too much.

865
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:17,770
Speaker 0: It's the right amount.

866
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,328
Speaker 0: You're not as much the appetizer guy as I am.

867
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:22,909
Speaker 0: Look, we went to Five Navkin, right?

868
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:28,210
Speaker 0: I wanted that milkshake and I got the milkshake, and I got my big ass burger, and I got fries.

869
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:29,689
Speaker 1: I got a lot of stuff.

870
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:30,609
Speaker 1: I got all the same stuff.

871
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,650
Speaker 1: I had the burger and the sweet potato fries.

872
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,570
Speaker 0: But lately I'm really feeling that default Five Navkin burger.

873
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:37,639
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

874
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:38,105
Speaker 1: I liked it.

875
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:43,649
Speaker 0: But I'm also craving, because I haven't had him in like six or seven months, Sloppy Joe.

876
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:44,950
Speaker 0: I think it's time.

877
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,769
Speaker 1: Well, Sloppy Joe is not a burger.

878
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:46,390
Speaker 0: It's a burger.

879
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:46,929
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

880
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,350
Speaker 0: It's a burger-like device that I put in my mouth.

881
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,390
Speaker 0: It makes burger happen.

882
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:51,909
Speaker 1: No, listen.

883
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:52,809
Speaker 1: Sloppy Joe.

884
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,609
Speaker 1: I mean, you could make a Sloppy Joe a burger, but you put Sloppy Joe on top of a burger.

885
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,536
Speaker 0: Right?

886
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:03,270
Speaker 1: But a hamburger needs to have a patty of ground beef that is then cooked.

887
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:07,230
Speaker 0: So is a patty melt a burger then?

888
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:08,830
Speaker 1: Does it have a patty of ground beef?

889
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,144
Speaker 1: Yes.

890
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:11,990
Speaker 1: Is it then placed between two pieces of bread?

891
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:15,470
Speaker 0: It is placed between two rye bread toasts.

892
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,389
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

893
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:16,869
Speaker 1: Toasts.

894
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,630
Speaker 0: You said bread.

895
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,490
Speaker 0: You said pieces of bread.

896
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,969
Speaker 0: That's fine.

897
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,730
Speaker 1: They have to be actual bun breads.

898
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,970
Speaker 0: What's the difference between bun and bread?

899
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:24,490
Speaker 0: Tell me right now.

900
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,769
Speaker 1: I'll tell you the difference right now.

901
00:40:26,232 --> 00:40:28,690
Speaker 1: A bun, right, is simply a roll.

902
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,270
Speaker 0: And then you can't pull that bullshit with your brioche burger.

903
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:32,289
Speaker 0: A brioche?

904
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,370
Speaker 1: You can make a brioche roll and cut it in half.

905
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,189
Speaker 0: So what's the difference between a roll and a bun?

906
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:39,090
Speaker 1: A bun is a roll that's been cut in half.

907
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:39,950
Speaker 0: All right.

908
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,909
Speaker 0: What's a hot cross bun?

909
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:42,648
Speaker 1: It's cut two times.

910
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:43,549
Speaker 0: Cut two times?

911
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,989
Speaker 0: It's not cut.

912
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,550
Speaker 0: It's just crossed.

913
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,090
Speaker 1: Right.

914
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:49,970
Speaker 1: No, but it's a cross bun because the top of it has a little cross in it and it's hot because it's hot.

915
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,710
Speaker 1: It just came out of the oven.

916
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,549
Speaker 1: It's a hot cross bun.

917
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:56,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you use a rye bread, a rye bread is not a roll, right?

918
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,730
Speaker 1: Unless you take a whole loaf of rye bread and cut it in half or make a rye roll.

919
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,970
Speaker 1: I don't know how you'd make a rye roll.

920
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,709
Speaker 1: Make a really small rye bread and cut it in half?

921
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,950
Speaker 1: Because it's all about the crust, right?

922
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,450
Speaker 1: Because a roll is a whole bunch of crust in sort of a rounded shape.

923
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:15,930
Speaker 1: Whereas a rye bread, the crust would only be around the edges and you would actually have inner breads on the top and bottom.

924
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,845
Speaker 0: What if I take a rye bread and cut the top and bottom off and put a patty melt inside of it?

925
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,567
Speaker 1: Because you make a small rye bread in the shape of a roll, which would make it a rye roll.

926
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:25,469
Speaker 0: So is that okay?

927
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:25,824
Speaker 0: Yeah.

928
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:26,290
Speaker 0: All right.

929
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:27,430
Speaker 0: So I make a patty melt like that.

930
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,350
Speaker 0: What about the patty melt?

931
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,609
Speaker 1: Would it still be a patty melt?

932
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:30,610
Speaker 0: Sure.

933
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,049
Speaker 1: Would it?

934
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:32,603
Speaker 0: Yeah.

935
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:38,509
Speaker 0: Well, the trouble is a melt is basically make grilled cheese and put a burger in it.

936
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:39,826
Speaker 1: All right.

937
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,648
Speaker 1: That's a melt.

938
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,329
Speaker 1: But grilled cheese doesn't go on a roll.

939
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,530
Speaker 1: Grilled cheese goes on two slices of bread.

940
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:51,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if I make grilled cheese, but the back of each grilled cheese, the outside part, is the crust of a rye bread?

941
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,410
Speaker 0: Now I've got a patty melt burger.

942
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:57,270
Speaker 1: But then no, because it's not a grilled cheese if it's not two slices.

943
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,269
Speaker 1: It would then be a roll.

944
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,390
Speaker 0: It's two slices, but the backs of both slices are crust.

945
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,949
Speaker 1: No, those aren't slices if the backs are both crusts.

946
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,530
Speaker 0: But who says it has to be slices to be a grilled cheese?

947
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,970
Speaker 0: I've made grilled cheese with the ends before.

948
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:09,530
Speaker 1: Okay.

949
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,690
Speaker 1: So then how about this, right?

950
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:12,150
Speaker 1: You buy a cheeseburger.

951
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,090
Speaker 1: Is a cheeseburger not a grilled cheese?

952
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,830
Speaker 1: There's cheese in there.

953
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,390
Speaker 1: It was grilled.

954
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,769
Speaker 0: No, because you have to grill the cheese.

955
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,242
Speaker 1: How is a cheeseburger a cheeseburger and not a grilled cheese with meat?

956
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:28,265
Speaker 0: It is a grilled cheese if you heat up the bun on a griddle with butter and melt cheese into it.

957
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:29,608
Speaker 1: They do that.

958
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,178
Speaker 0: Yeah.

959
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,909
Speaker 0: Then it is also a grilled cheese.

960
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:34,810
Speaker 0: If I'm eating this food, it now has the tags.

961
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,590
Speaker 0: It's like free market.

962
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:36,810
Speaker 0: Tag, burger.

963
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:38,089
Speaker 0: Tag, grilled cheese.

964
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:39,350
Speaker 1: Two tags.

965
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,989
Speaker 1: It can't be both.

966
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:40,850
Speaker 1: It can be both.

967
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,889
Speaker 1: It can't be a cheeseburger and be a grilled cheese sandwich.

968
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,070
Speaker 1: Because it's not just a grilled cheese.

969
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,350
Speaker 1: It's a grilled cheese sandwich.

970
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,550
Speaker 0: You're stuck in this old world nomenclature, this hierarchical bullshit.

971
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,050
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I'm using a hip modern tagging system.

972
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,358
Speaker 1: Sure.

973
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:54,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

974
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,427
Speaker 1: Whatever.

975
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,223
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

976
00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:57,448
Speaker 1: Anyway.

977
00:42:57,732 --> 00:42:58,230
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

978
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:58,909
Speaker 0: I'm so hungry.

979
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,850
Speaker 1: So we could talk about burgers for like a hundred years probably.

980
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:02,610
Speaker 0: I'll say this.

981
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,650
Speaker 0: I'm so hungry and in like five minutes I'm going down to Spin, which is like this high class ping pong club.

982
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,369
Speaker 1: You're going to Spin?

983
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:08,889
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

984
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,141
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:10,049
Speaker 0: Second time.

986
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,507
Speaker 0: You know what?

987
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,388
Speaker 0: Company's paying too.

988
00:43:11,735 --> 00:43:11,949
Speaker 0: What?

989
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:12,528
Speaker 0: And you know what?

990
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:12,790
Speaker 1: Spin.

991
00:43:12,812 --> 00:43:13,008
Speaker 1: For what?

992
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:13,284
Speaker 1: Why?

993
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,150
Speaker 1: Why was this occasion?

994
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,010
Speaker 0: Celebrating the fact that I still work there.

995
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:17,328
Speaker 1: Just for you?

996
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,630
Speaker 0: No, for my department that we all still work there.

997
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:20,370
Speaker 1: All right.

998
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:20,624
Speaker 0: Yeah.

999
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:21,330
Speaker 0: Company president.

1000
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,029
Speaker 0: Fancy affair.

1001
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,749
Speaker 0: You know what they got there?

1002
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:25,889
Speaker 1: They got sliders.

1003
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,650
Speaker 0: They smell like they have that onion that White Castle has, but it's real goddamn meat.

1004
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:34,690
Speaker 0: They're basically real meat, White Castle.

1005
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:36,146
Speaker 1: Not a fan of the sliders.

1006
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,450
Speaker 0: These are damn good sliders.

1007
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,850
Speaker 0: These sliders have pickle, onion, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard.

1008
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:40,470
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1009
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,850
Speaker 1: First of all, I don't like mustard.

1010
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,848
Speaker 0: Well, fuck you.

1011
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,870
Speaker 1: Second of all, you know, the thing with sliders is a lot of, it's, they don't, you know- They're not burgers.

1012
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:49,468
Speaker 0: They're sliders.

1013
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:50,509
Speaker 0: I will give you that.

1014
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,329
Speaker 1: It's just, they're just not, they can't replace a hamburger.

1015
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,009
Speaker 0: No, they can't.

1016
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,250
Speaker 0: But if you eat 10 of those things, you're not so good at ping pong anymore.

1017
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:06,220
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1018
