1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,669
Speaker 1: It's Monday July 6th 2020.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,456
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:18,719
Speaker 1: We are talking about quotes obsolete unquote technology.

4
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,200
Speaker 1: So, uh, you know, we can't.

6
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:37,172
Speaker 1: I can't do a lot of the things I would normally do During the summer in the quarantine like I can't go to the beach I can't do the super long bike rides or like bike rides that require me to take a train or anything Like.

7
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:42,479
Speaker 1: I'm kind of limited to the area I can get to Can't do any organized bike ride with other people.

8
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:43,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

9
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:49,895
Speaker 1: So what I'm increasingly trying to do is Find new ways to interact with the spaces I have access to.

10
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:55,828
Speaker 1: so on Thursday cuz we had a long weekend Thursday was last day of work Emily and I we went out to bike up and down the west side.

11
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,090
Speaker 1: now You might say but rim the west side is just a normal bike path.

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,661
Speaker 1: You can go bike there anytime and I often would normally during kovin.

13
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:16,345
Speaker 1: that bike path because it's really nice is Crazy crowded during the day like more people are walking and riding up and down that west side path that goes from the bottom of Manhattan to the top of Manhattan now then are like on a normal summer like it's

14
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:16,846
Speaker 0: also not.

15
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:19,400
Speaker 0: it's also even if it's empty It's not a great path.

16
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,449
Speaker 0: It's like you do it.

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,990
Speaker 0: It's like you do it a few times and then eventually you're like the novelty wears off like well tip of Manhattan again.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:44,339
Speaker 1: Usually I usually like you head north on it and then you go over a bridge and you keep going north Mmm, so anyway, what we did is around 11 11 30 p.m On Thursday, we went and got our bikes and we went over there to bike around up and down the west side in the middle of the night.

19
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,503
Speaker 1: Okay, that context makes it really fun.

20
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,410
Speaker 1: Like that was really worth doing.

21
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,498
Speaker 1: There's a lot of different animals out.

22
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,635
Speaker 1: There's a very different type of person who's hanging out in those parks In the middle of the night.

23
00:01:58,176 --> 00:01:58,678
Speaker 1: there were some.

24
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,783
Speaker 1: there were some chill parties going on.

25
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:14,950
Speaker 1: there was some stuff I saw that was fascinating But that was a very fun experience and I intend to All the paths I have biked to death during the day over the last decade in New York.

26
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,668
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do every one of those bike rides again in the middle of the night.

27
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:28,258
Speaker 0: Okay, the problem is a lot of the places to bike in the middle of the night are places that are Too much car and you'll die because it's night.

28
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,950
Speaker 1: and though there's a lot more than usual in this a lot.

29
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:34,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of closed places.

30
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot.

31
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,950
Speaker 1: some bridges and bike paths closed some parks closed, but the west side never closes.

32
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:40,839
Speaker 0: No, it's just it's open.

33
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:41,625
Speaker 0: You can't close it.

34
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:41,988
Speaker 0: Really.

35
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:48,762
Speaker 1: Yep I think technically the parks next to it are closed after dusk, but the path itself is not Mmm.

36
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,268
Speaker 1: Alright, you got any news?

37
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,973
Speaker 0: Do I have this?

38
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,003
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so check it out.

39
00:02:54,023 --> 00:03:06,530
Speaker 0: these people announce this camera right called the pixie camera and At its core this camera is actually a kind of good to great idea and concept, right?

40
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670
Speaker 0: So first of all, it has a Leica lens mount.

41
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,454
Speaker 0: So like like.

42
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:15,846
Speaker 0: a cameras are like, you know, the ultimate luxury brand of camera.

43
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:21,110
Speaker 0: They're super duper expensive But they are sort of unique, right?

44
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,076
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like they're not.

45
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:28,910
Speaker 0: they're not good and better enough to be worth the insane insane price, right?

46
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:37,750
Speaker 0: but they are Unique and cool and their lenses are very high quality Even though they cost like, you know way way way more than other lenses.

47
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:41,790
Speaker 1: I own one like a lens my entire my drive one.

48
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:46,406
Speaker 1: I don't think you have in any though that my camcorder has a like a made lens in it.

49
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,994
Speaker 0: Oh That's it.

50
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:51,729
Speaker 0: That's not the same as It's not the same as a like a m mount.

51
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:56,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like a m mount lens, but like a m mount lens cost more than your entire camcorders.

52
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:07,518
Speaker 0: So if you want to use those lenses maybe you have one or there are some other companies that have made lenses for the m mount which You know, it's like.

53
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:13,732
Speaker 0: well if you want to use one of those lenses Even if you get a cheap one like Voigtlander makes some right which are still expensive but cheaper It's like.

54
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:27,289
Speaker 0: well you have to get some like a camera or there are some cameras you can get like a Bessa I think mates an m mount film camera, but there really aren't M mount digital cameras out there right other than the Leica ones which cost a fortune, right?

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,950
Speaker 0: So they're making a digital camera that has a Leica M mount on it and it's and it's not a like a camera.

56
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,698
Speaker 0: So it's like oh, that's that's good.

57
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:44,675
Speaker 0: Right and it's a rangefinder format camera Which is what like makes and there aren't enough digital rangefinder cameras out there that are high quality Other than like Fuji and Leica.

58
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:45,718
Speaker 0: right.

59
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,790
Speaker 0: and the other thing is this camera doesn't have an LCD screen on it.

60
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,777
Speaker 0: Which if you have a rangefinder, what do you need a?

61
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,483
Speaker 0: what do you need LCD screen for?

62
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,008
Speaker 0: right it just.

63
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:02,889
Speaker 0: you know Most digital cameras these days have the feature where you hook it up to an app on your phone and it sends the photos Over to the phone pretty much immediately.

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:13,385
Speaker 0: Yeah phones already got a really good screen like every single like even my Panasonic GF2 had that feature But my gh5 has it gh4 had it One has it.

65
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:23,308
Speaker 0: Might you may be surprised Jack using Wi-Fi slash Bluetooth my Fuji GF whatever it is 100 whatever has it right?

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,804
Speaker 0: So You know, it's a common feature, but they're like, hey, we have that feature now.

67
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,490
Speaker 0: Why do we need the LCD screen?

68
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,588
Speaker 0: We'll just have a little tiny screen on top for your settings your battery life, you know that sort of thing, right?

69
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:41,939
Speaker 0: And we'll have a little tiny little bit of memory in the camera to buffer up the photos, right and then we'll send them Over to your phone.

70
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,881
Speaker 0: So you just look at your phone Which is a better screen than we can put on the back of.

71
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,590
Speaker 1: this can reminds me of what was the Sony?

72
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,625
Speaker 1: Where it's just like a lens and the lens just sent the images directly to your phone.

73
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, right.

74
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,565
Speaker 0: So this is actually like in concept like hey, it's like I kind of want that.

75
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:57,729
Speaker 0: That's pretty great, right?

76
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:08,951
Speaker 0: so here's where it stops getting great is a. The sensor in this camera is only 11 megapixels so 11 11 11.1.

77
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,097
Speaker 0: So and it's a PSC.

78
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:18,310
Speaker 0: so The Leica lenses are designed for like full-frame sensors, which is what are in the Leica M cameras.

79
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:28,010
Speaker 0: Right, even the older ones like the Leica 8 and 9 have full-frame sensors Even though the Leica nines has a better as more megapixels than this the like.

80
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,018
Speaker 1: Let me put $10,000 racing tires on my Corolla, right?

81
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,908
Speaker 0: So the thing is I'm not like a megapixel fiend like who cares if you're not printing out the image?

82
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:38,530
Speaker 0: super enormous.

83
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,755
Speaker 0: You don't need all those megapixels.

84
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not making billboards right exactly.

85
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:53,410
Speaker 0: But the point is that You know, it's like hey 11 megapixels, it's like you just use the cat if your phone is the screen the phone has a camera.

86
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's a carry around any camera That's not.

87
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,981
Speaker 0: the phone has to be better than the phone.

88
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,953
Speaker 0: I don't think this is better than the phone camera Right.

89
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:05,798
Speaker 0: So that's problem number one.

90
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:10,129
Speaker 0: The big problem though is they're charging how much money for this, right?

91
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,073
Speaker 0: $3,000.

92
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:17,987
Speaker 0: now that might make sense because a like a digital camera the Leica m10 costs like $8,000.

93
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:27,008
Speaker 1: Yeah Right now no just for perspective my Busted like four-year-old Android phone has a 19 megapixel sensor, right?

94
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,630
Speaker 0: Right.

95
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:39,129
Speaker 0: so if you wanted to write if you wanted to get a Leica m9 like a used one right which is a full-frame sensor That's been a takes the same lenses and is better than this and has a screen on it.

96
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,701
Speaker 0: You can get one of those for two to three thousand dollars.

97
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:47,619
Speaker 0: So cheaper than the pixie Right, but the real killer is that you could get.

98
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,865
Speaker 0: this has an aps-c sensor right now full-frame.

99
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,478
Speaker 0: you could get a Fuji Like X Pro 3 or whatever.

100
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:55,481
Speaker 0: It's called right.

101
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,490
Speaker 0: the Fuji makes rangefinder digital cameras.

102
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, tell it has a Fuji mount on it, right as opposed to a Leica M mount.

103
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,685
Speaker 0: But that thing only costs like $1,800, right and sure it has a screen on it.

104
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,617
Speaker 0: But it also does hurting me.

105
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,241
Speaker 0: it's cool, it's also vastly.

106
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,370
Speaker 0: it's vastly superior to this camera in every way.

107
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,420
Speaker 1: Hey, this doesn't even have a SD slot.

108
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,149
Speaker 1: You can't even put a card into it, right?

109
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:20,212
Speaker 0: Exactly.

110
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,644
Speaker 1: My phone doesn't have enough storage to keep all the raws.

111
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:27,697
Speaker 1: I take when I go out My phone does.

112
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:31,935
Speaker 0: but the point is is that Four-year-old busted Android.

113
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,701
Speaker 1: I've got a 60 this camera would make.

114
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,030
Speaker 0: this camera would make a ton of sense.

115
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,850
Speaker 0: It'd be amazing if it cost a few hundred dollars and maybe it was micro 4/3 and maybe had a better sensor.

116
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,819
Speaker 0: You know micro 4/3 wouldn't help it right, but just a better sensor.

117
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,102
Speaker 0: But yeah charging $3,000.

118
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:51,590
Speaker 0: The thing makes no sense whatsoever to exist.

119
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:52,548
Speaker 0: I don't understand.

120
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,064
Speaker 0: Why would anyone would buy this ever even if you're rich.

121
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,530
Speaker 0: if you're rich you can just buy a life.

122
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,770
Speaker 1: So I do get the impression there's a weird segment of the camera market.

123
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:16,930
Speaker 1: That's because I've seen like ads and people talking about this specific area in the business world of trying to sell like Cameras to people who use their cell phone for most photos but perceive that a handheld camera will do better.

124
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,258
Speaker 0: But handheld camera will do better if you buy one that's better.

125
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:30,764
Speaker 1: Yep, but who don't know how to use photography and in practice Want to interact with their photos entirely on their phone like they just want?

126
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:34,616
Speaker 1: it's like an accessory to their phone The accessories the wealth.

127
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:38,269
Speaker 0: so first of all, this is $3,000 so it's hitting only luxury people, right?

128
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,589
Speaker 1: Somebody doesn't know that their iPhone is probably literally better than this.

129
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:53,710
Speaker 0: So what I see so what I have seen from the celebrity Instagram crowd Right is people buying Leica cameras that are not the m10 the Leica ones that are easier to use, right?

130
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,098
Speaker 0: And I've seen them buying.

131
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,630
Speaker 0: also a very popular thing to do is get film cameras.

132
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:10,204
Speaker 0: So the context g2 is like an old film camera that's sort of like an instant kind of 35 millimeter deal That does have sort of interchangeable lenses and it's become it's still.

133
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:14,290
Speaker 0: it has become crazy popular And the price of it is very vastly inflated.

134
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,914
Speaker 1: What are the listeners even said?

135
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:20,346
Speaker 1: you can get a full-frame Sony a7ri 42 megapixel for less than this.

136
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,429
Speaker 0: Yes, you can.

137
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:28,677
Speaker 0: So this and I and you know what you can also connect your phone to that and get your photos sent directly over Right, so I don't know why.

138
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,484
Speaker 0: what they're thinking with this camera?

139
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,010
Speaker 0: it makes it makes no sense.

140
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just makes no sense to me at this price.

141
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:38,571
Speaker 0: it should be like $200.

142
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,274
Speaker 0: Then it would be amazing.

143
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:42,668
Speaker 0: I might buy one like $200 right just to you know, why not?

144
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,612
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's a thing.

145
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,101
Speaker 0: and then it's sort of related camera news, right?

146
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:52,431
Speaker 0: Olympus the only maker of micro four-thirds Cameras.

147
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:57,889
Speaker 0: well, not the only I mean there are a few other ones like black magic makes a few and such and such.

148
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:13,648
Speaker 0: but the only major manufacturer of micro four-thirds cameras besides Panasonic Olympus has sold their camera their consumer You know camera division to this other Japanese company and that oh my air conditioner is still on making noise.

149
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:14,230
Speaker 1: That's fine.

150
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:15,776
Speaker 1: No, mine's on to buy did.

151
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:16,780
Speaker 0: like though it is.

152
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:17,142
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:17,383
Speaker 0: All right.

154
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:17,825
Speaker 0: I'm leaving.

155
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:18,488
Speaker 1: I'm leaving it on.

156
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:18,990
Speaker 1: that's fine.

157
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:23,386
Speaker 0: Deal with the deal with the noise listener, it's outside Yeah.

158
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,170
Speaker 0: So they have sold their camera business to some other Japanese company and that Japanese company is basically a shady liquidator.

159
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,530
Speaker 1: So I had an article that was my original link for this news that went out into a lot more depth about the liquidator.

160
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,947
Speaker 1: I got a 404 and I tried to go back to that page.

161
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:40,350
Speaker 1: So I'm like.

162
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:52,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, the point is Yeah, what this means for the future of micro four-thirds as a camera platform is sort of like a who-knows kind of deal.

163
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:54,699
Speaker 0: Right Panasonic could keep it alive or not.

164
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,710
Speaker 0: It's open so people can still make those cameras.

165
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,078
Speaker 1: It sounds the only other company you probably could keep it like fully alive because they have Panasonic.

166
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,184
Speaker 0: right, right.

167
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:04,867
Speaker 0: So so does a limp.

168
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:12,648
Speaker 0: but Panasonic Has you know added and they are making those other cameras that have a full-frame sensor?

169
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:16,340
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Which has their their partner with Leica.

170
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,187
Speaker 0: It's the L mount cameras, right?

171
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,772
Speaker 0: So It's like.

172
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:27,419
Speaker 0: well, they're still making micro four-thirds stuff, but they have also launched this other line of You know cameras, right?

173
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,590
Speaker 0: So will they continue mega four-thirds or not?

174
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:39,476
Speaker 0: so if micro four-thirds dies and no one makes stuff forward anymore then a You might be able to get it for cheap Especially if you're not a professional like.

175
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,403
Speaker 1: that's how I get a lot of audio equipment.

176
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:43,510
Speaker 0: It's still great, right?

177
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:45,625
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with it, right?

178
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,288
Speaker 1: If it dies dies, I'll go pick up a bunch of used lenses, right?

179
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,721
Speaker 0: Exactly You can get a whole bunch of stuff.

180
00:12:52,105 --> 00:13:05,179
Speaker 0: or B You could sell your stuff to the people looking to pick up the cheap stuff Especially someone who's incorporated it into a professional workflow and doesn't want to have to change their pipeline or change Well, okay, so and then buy something else.

181
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,970
Speaker 0: right you switch a different platform, but I think the professional you just mentioned, right?

182
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:17,456
Speaker 0: That's the people where they sort of can't necessarily stick with it unless they have a ton of stuff because you can't get a repair You can't get a replacement.

183
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:28,930
Speaker 1: You can't get a warranty if this stuff is like, yeah I don't know how many of you have used professional camera equipment But it's getting support for it is really important because things break and weird stuff happen.

184
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,215
Speaker 1: I with this face you're like.

185
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:34,070
Speaker 0: if you're like say a professional photographer you're doing like, you know magazine stuff, right?

186
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,592
Speaker 0: And you're out.

187
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:35,960
Speaker 0: you're out travel you're doing.

188
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:39,956
Speaker 0: you're traveling the world taking photos It's like and you're shooting on Olympus.

189
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,781
Speaker 0: this usually because you're like.

190
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:44,730
Speaker 0: Olympus is sponsoring and supporting you with stuff, right?

191
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:59,490
Speaker 0: So it if anyone who is like one of those Olympus photographers now has to switch to something else Right, because even though they probably still have a bunch of gear and it will probably still work They can't be out on a shoot and need help and get boned, right?

192
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,030
Speaker 0: They need to have a living company behind them.

193
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:09,598
Speaker 1: like you're one really really low light lens get stolen and now you're just screwed because there's literally no way to get another lens like That for your platform, right?

194
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:12,269
Speaker 1: Except for the one shady guy on eBay who has one for a lot of money.

195
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:16,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you do is the one he sends you gonna work a whole.

196
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,769
Speaker 0: so So that's a. that's a thing now.

197
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,170
Speaker 0: So if you're buying camera if you're getting into a camera platform from nothing, right?

198
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,830
Speaker 0: It's like, you know micro four-thirds is still great, right?

199
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,430
Speaker 0: Are you gonna are you gonna spend a bunch of you know?

200
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,230
Speaker 0: You could go and get it for way cheap from someone dumping it and you know get in on the the cheap.

201
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,244
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep an eye on on eBay because I could use a better zoom lens.

202
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:44,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, or You could you know get something else and avoid a dying.

203
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:58,777
Speaker 1: So in some other news Supreme Court Has a lot of rulings recently and I think historically they very rarely continued to issue more rulings into July Like they're doing more than usual.

204
00:14:58,817 --> 00:14:59,780
Speaker 0: They're they're doing it.

205
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,492
Speaker 0: You know, I guess I don't know if the how the the online Arguments of Affected.

206
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:10,530
Speaker 1: I saw like scones last night people just kind of freaking out about the fact that they issued more in July.

207
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:16,470
Speaker 1: No, but they actually did a ruling that I didn't know was the case cuz I wasn't paying attention.

208
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,156
Speaker 0: Supreme Court algy-related.

209
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:28,130
Speaker 1: Yep today a little while ago like right before we did the show upheld a 1991 law that bans robo calls to cell phones.

210
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:35,099
Speaker 1: Now you might be wondering but black dynamite I Get an infinite number of robo calls to my cell phone.

211
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,622
Speaker 1: just because this is the law does not mean that anyone has been capable Of enforcing it at any point.

212
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,842
Speaker 0: Oh There's a law that you're not supposed to drive over X miles an hour on the road.

213
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:49,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, like dynamite Everyone's driving crazy fast on the road and no one's getting in trouble for it.

214
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,737
Speaker 1: So yeah I've tried to figure out what the deal was with.

215
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,050
Speaker 1: like what was the lawsuit around this that took until the year?

216
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,195
Speaker 1: 2020 to resolve.

217
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:14,169
Speaker 1: so here's the deal basically in Congress made a bullshit exception to this law That allowed automated robo calls to any phone number, even if it's a cell phone for the purposes of collection of government debt.

218
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:16,600
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like.

219
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,170
Speaker 1: that's an oddly specific loophole.

220
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:23,249
Speaker 0: I think that's you know, as long as the government is the one doing the collection, right?

221
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:25,931
Speaker 0: You know like you are mine He's.

222
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,338
Speaker 1: so part of the ruling actually addressed that as well.

223
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:39,450
Speaker 1: quote six justices agreed that by allowing debt collection calls to cell phones Congress quote impermissibly favored debt collection speech over political and other speech in violation of the First Amendment.

224
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:46,326
Speaker 0: interesting because I was thinking each I See, but the way I would think of it is like what you're collecting.

225
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:48,816
Speaker 0: government debt Right is like it would be.

226
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:52,730
Speaker 0: the actual government is making the call right not some debt collector?

227
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:58,670
Speaker 1: No, but if a debt collector owns government debt like a student loan, yeah, see that's bullshit, right?

228
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,597
Speaker 0: That shouldn't even be allowed to happen, right?

229
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:04,010
Speaker 0: It shouldn't be legal for a non the non government to hold government.

230
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,788
Speaker 0: It should be like the IRS is calling you because you owe back taxes, right?

231
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,469
Speaker 0: It's like yeah They should be able to call yourself.

232
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:17,290
Speaker 1: So if that's the only way to contact you, so basically the lawsuit was a bunch of political consultants and pollsters.

233
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:23,204
Speaker 1: We're trying to get the entire law struck down because they want to make robocalls to cell phones.

234
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:32,510
Speaker 0: for a million reasons, of course Yeah, because they're the only ones right because the ban right is ineffectively banning robocalls from shady people.

235
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but they are acting.

236
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,530
Speaker 0: they're legitimate organizations, right?

237
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,930
Speaker 0: They're political pollsters in the US right there, right?

238
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,470
Speaker 0: And so the law actually does stop them from giving you robocalls, right?

239
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,837
Speaker 0: It's the people who are successfully making robocalls.

240
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:51,030
Speaker 0: are people outside the law legal framework of the United States, right?

241
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:58,648
Speaker 1: So basically from what I can gather the issue was whether or not Congress could allow some speech but not other speech.

242
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:03,210
Speaker 1: and If they can't make those kinds of distinctions that the whole law should be unconstitutional.

243
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:09,150
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think it's clear that it can't if it can't be based on the content of the call.

244
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:12,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it looks like I haven't read the.

245
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,310
Speaker 1: this like just is kind of breaking news.

246
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,060
Speaker 1: I haven't read the opinion yet, but it looks like this backfired on them and the Supreme Court actually even got rid of that 2015 exception.

247
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,715
Speaker 1: Okay There's a money quote here America from the decision.

248
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:31,270
Speaker 1: Americans passionately disagree about many things, but they are largely United in their disdain for robocalls.

249
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:34,202
Speaker 0: That's true.

250
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:43,230
Speaker 1: During arguments in the case Justice Stephen Breyer got a cut off when someone tried calling him.

251
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:51,138
Speaker 1: He said after he rejoined the court's arguments quote the telephone started to ring and it cut me off the call but I don't think it was a robocall.

252
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:57,962
Speaker 1: so I think I think the Online arguments are not going super well based on that statement.

253
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,807
Speaker 1: I feel like they're getting interrupted into.

254
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:00,329
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

255
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,929
Speaker 0: I know we have some international listener out there at least one, right?

256
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:11,050
Speaker 0: Are there robocalls a problem in other countries right as they are in the u.s.

257
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:11,955
Speaker 1: Like?

258
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,569
Speaker 1: this is the broader point why I brought up this news in the u.s.

259
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:19,670
Speaker 1: Robocalls are bad enough to where the idea of a phone number is just fucked.

260
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:23,749
Speaker 1: Most people don't answer their phone when it rings at all or if they have put it.

261
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,227
Speaker 0: There is a setting on my iPhone and everyone should be aware of this setting it.

262
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:34,990
Speaker 0: My iPhone is set to automatically not ring if the phone number that is calling is not in my contacts.

263
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:43,510
Speaker 0: Yep, there's a similar Android setting and if somebody wants to call me And it's a legit call they should be leaving a voicemail, right?

264
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,938
Speaker 0: So sometimes it's pretty rare that a robocall leaves a voicemail, but it happens occasionally Yeah, right, and I just delete it.

265
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:50,500
Speaker 0: no big deal.

266
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,330
Speaker 0: And I know it doesn't interrupt me or bother me.

267
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,910
Speaker 0: It happens super rarely right and I have an app that I you know, there's various apps out there.

268
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,957
Speaker 0: I don't know which ones are better.

269
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,710
Speaker 0: So I don't recommend one or over the other.

270
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,510
Speaker 0: But I picked an app from the App Store that blocks many robocalls.

271
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:07,067
Speaker 0: So that helps also.

272
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:25,564
Speaker 1: but the broader point here is that Because like look there's a Supreme Court case about they had to pass a law to block spam in the United States on phones because of the very heavy restrictions and Regulations around the telephone network because it was invented a long time ago.

273
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,290
Speaker 1: There's a lot of regulation around it.

274
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:49,527
Speaker 1: it is used very differently today from how it was used back then, but basically By because of all these restrictions on the ability to restrict phone calls No one like Verizon or Sprint or anyone who runs the cell network could probably just block these robocalls automatically today by flipping a switch like that would be trivial just like spam blockers,

275
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:50,190
Speaker 0: but

276
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:55,923
Speaker 1: Generally, and I'm not getting into specifics There's a lot of laws and regulations that say phone calls have to get through.

277
00:20:56,003 --> 00:21:05,390
Speaker 1: you can't arbitrarily block phone calls Even though most people would gladly let someone arbitrary block arbitrarily block phone calls to them to avoid these robocalls.

278
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:10,324
Speaker 1: The only reason people use email today is because there's no such regulation.

279
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:24,030
Speaker 1: It's not illegal to block spam So everyone blocks spam, but it's effectively illegal to block robocalls Thus making phones completely worthless as a means of contacting someone who you have not already contacted.

280
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:34,187
Speaker 1: The reason this is an even weirder problem now Is that Phone calls from numbers you don't recognize are one of the primary means of doing contact tracing for COVID.

281
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:43,390
Speaker 1: and it turns out I read a separate article Nobody answers their phones when the government calls and nobody even listens to the voicemails when the government calls.

282
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:51,885
Speaker 1: So contact tracing is not working that well because people are trained to know that anytime their phone rings and they don't know the number It's spam and they don't answer it.

283
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:58,130
Speaker 1: There's no way to solve this without radically restructuring how telephone numbers are regulated.

284
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,136
Speaker 0: You could just stop robocalls.

285
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:08,870
Speaker 0: if they blocked all robocalls at the variety at the telco level I think it would only take a matter of months for people to regain trust in phone.

286
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,574
Speaker 1: I think so, too.

287
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:10,922
Speaker 0: I think it would.

288
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,330
Speaker 0: it would take like no time at all, right?

289
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:20,350
Speaker 1: It's like we have a society to one accept false positives Like occasionally a call would get blocked that you want it just like we do with email.

290
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:26,330
Speaker 0: I think it would be pretty rare because almost all of the illegal robocalls are coming from outside the country.

291
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,777
Speaker 0: Yeah from a few sources.

292
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,064
Speaker 1: Ah, but they look so yeah.

293
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

294
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,033
Speaker 0: So what I think?

295
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:39,710
Speaker 0: I think the way it would sort of work is like you would report a robocall To like Verizon would see like a flurry of calls coming in and like a few would get through and then they block.

296
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:46,730
Speaker 1: Yep, right Like if one source calls multiple phone numbers in the same area code in a short span of time that gets flagged for review automatically

297
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:47,732
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

298
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:48,535
Speaker 1: but

299
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:54,381
Speaker 0: or like you would you would get it you would get a call and it would be a scam and you'd report it And then they'd fit.

300
00:22:54,401 --> 00:23:01,070
Speaker 0: they'd look in the logs Figure out exactly where that came from and then close off that route and that person would lose phone service to the u.s.

301
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:04,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, right from wherever they are or it would be certain.

302
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:06,116
Speaker 0: The problem is you would get into.

303
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:19,573
Speaker 0: issues were like, let's say there's like a phone carrier right and say I don't know pick a country country X right and that carrier, you know There's like a neighborhood and in the neighborhood There's a bunch of grandma's Right and one

304
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:20,577
Speaker 1: robocall scammer

305
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,110
Speaker 0: and one robocall as a little office with some scammers in it, right?

306
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,450
Speaker 0: And they're all on the same phone, you know network thing, right?

307
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:38,030
Speaker 0: but we already accept the risk of what you just described for all of the All of the grandchildren of those grandmas who immigrated to the United States wouldn't would have a problem with grandma calling them.

308
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,777
Speaker 1: But we already have that today with email.

309
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:46,948
Speaker 1: if you if your email provider is using IPs that are adjacent to dodgy IPS your emails don't go anywhere.

310
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,600
Speaker 1: We already accept that.

311
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:50,265
Speaker 0: I guess.

312
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:50,930
Speaker 0: I guess that's true.

313
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:57,150
Speaker 0: I mean in the old days before there was AI driven grandma's using the shady ISP that the spammers use for her email.

314
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,699
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get grandma's email in the days before.

315
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,710
Speaker 0: the problem is is that grandma can choose a different email provider.

316
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,795
Speaker 0: Grandma can get a Gmail.

317
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:09,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, grandma can't change the phone company in country X. Yeah, but grandma well companies just where you live.

318
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:16,850
Speaker 1: but grandma might be banned from editing with Wikipedia forever because grandma only has two ISP options both of which are blocked by Wikipedia.

319
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:27,710
Speaker 1: Could be yeah I remember in the RIT days I would like when I ran an email server like I blocked Any email that came from an IP address outside of the United States at one point to try to stop spam?

320
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:37,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the government could also like eminent domain Google's anti-spam technology.

321
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:44,890
Speaker 0: and You know you know you wouldn't even have to force a company like Google to like make anti-spam for phones.

322
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,339
Speaker 0: You could just make a government contract to do it.

323
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:50,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, they happily would fall over their selves themselves bidding on that.

324
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:55,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could just be like hey who wants the government's putting up bids for the the?

325
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaker 0: you know the u.s.

326
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,848
Speaker 0: anti-phone spam blocking software That will be applied to all incoming phone calls.

327
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:04,765
Speaker 0: Who wants to build it?

328
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:11,600
Speaker 1: One billion dollar but anyway things of the day.

329
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:15,540
Speaker 1: So I did not know the thing I'm about to talk about.

330
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,510
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing that I feel like I should have known.

331
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,279
Speaker 1: I feel dumb for having not known it.

332
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:27,849
Speaker 1: Basically you ever notice how when you get a deck of playing cards like a standard deck 52 cards The ace of spades is always fancier than all the other cards.

333
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,502
Speaker 1: like the design on it is usually a lot fancier than the other Suit.

334
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,710
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean, it's just sort of like.

335
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,100
Speaker 0: it's sort of like a just an accepted truth.

336
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,072
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, the ace of spades is the awesome card ace of spades.

337
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:41,453
Speaker 0: right?

338
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:41,573
Speaker 0: this?

339
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:43,800
Speaker 0: you know the songs ace of spades?

340
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

341
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:46,315
Speaker 0: It's like it just is.

342
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:52,980
Speaker 0: so Cuz I know I'd not until just now I just sort of accepted it as a truth of the universe.

343
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw this tweet and my brain said why didn't you ever ask this question?

344
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:58,438
Speaker 1: you dumb piece of shit?

345
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:01,493
Speaker 1: Is the kind of thing you would want to know about this?

346
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:02,799
Speaker 0: is the guy really want to know now?

347
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the answer is actually really good.

348
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,391
Speaker 1: This is a Twitter thread that explains it all.

349
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:15,236
Speaker 1: the answer involves King James the second Goddamnit And the English text system and also a specific breed of chicken.

350
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:21,370
Speaker 1: I'm not joking So the short answer is and you could read this thread to get all the details.

351
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:24,639
Speaker 1: is that in England in the 1600s?

352
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,000
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm King James the second introduced a tax on playing cards.

353
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:34,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's been a tax on playing cards even in the US today.

354
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:46,480
Speaker 1: There's a little sticker on playing cards Yep, so in order to basically Up to that point there were rules requiring anyone making playing cards to put their printers logo on the cards in the deck.

355
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:51,234
Speaker 1: So people would know who printed those cards to help in the tax investigations.

356
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:52,197
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

357
00:26:52,218 --> 00:27:03,620
Speaker 1: So later in 1765 the English tax office introduced to be able to make better compliance with these taxes a Standard design for the ace of spades the duty ace.

358
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:10,780
Speaker 1: So every deck of cards the ace of spades was the receipt that you had paid the taxes and had a really complicated design.

359
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:18,743
Speaker 1: That would have been hard to forge and everyone who was authorized to make trading cards had like the die to print this Standard.

360
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:23,740
Speaker 0: I say so if you were if you were if the at the printing at the printing company where they were making cards.

361
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you dutifully paid your taxes, the government would give you this thing to let you print.

362
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:37,979
Speaker 0: aces of spades Yep, and and every few days you are not paying if you're not paying your taxes They would take that away from you or change it for everyone else.

363
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,740
Speaker 0: Yeah So your ace of spades is and you're playing cards would look man and they'd know that that was an illegal.

364
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:57,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you were caught with the deck of cards that didn't have the duty a city What if I just had an old Aztec from pre-tax, I don't know the details of 1765 era English law unfortunately, but the thread actually links to a bunch of references.

365
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:58,640
Speaker 1: I think we can answer that question.

366
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:07,302
Speaker 1: So over time they kept making that design more and more complex to make it hard to counterfeit because people got really good at counterfeiting The ace of spades.

367
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:08,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

368
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:28,640
Speaker 1: So they started doing something that today we would probably call more like Baroque Like I made a Baroque design but in the 1800s for Reasons related to those chickens and maybe to a certain Women's hairstyle of the day they called that ridiculous ornamentation that was hard to counterfeit.

369
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:33,070
Speaker 1: Frizzling they said that it would that the design was frizzled mm-hmm.

370
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:36,330
Speaker 1: That ties into a woman's hairstyle.

371
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:43,080
Speaker 1: and then a particular kind of chicken That was called frizzled because they had the Polish frizzle feather.

372
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:48,840
Speaker 1: The frizzle feather chicken kind of looked like the design the standard design for the ace of spades.

373
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:57,130
Speaker 1: Once the laws were updated to where they relaxed it and you were no longer required to do the duty ace They came up with modern stuff like that little thing you see on a bicycle deck today.

374
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:08,920
Speaker 1: People just kept making fancy ace of spades because they had been throughout all of history and many of the card makers Included bird wings and or that frizzled chicken in reference to the frizzling.

375
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:14,020
Speaker 1: Okay, that's why you'll often see a cock on the ace of spades in a fancy deck of cards.

376
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:16,067
Speaker 0: Oh, I've seen cocks on the ace of spades before.

377
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:18,877
Speaker 1: so if this actually answered a lot of vague questions.

378
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:22,566
Speaker 0: I had never asked Yeah, that sounds great.

379
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:29,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, somebody got so when I was in college learning The basics of logic and computer science.

380
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:34,450
Speaker 0: there was a little like free software kind of program They they had a download link for.

381
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,715
Speaker 0: I think ran on.

382
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:36,900
Speaker 0: I think was like a Java app.

383
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:49,412
Speaker 0: I think someone might even written at the school I don't know, but it was like a little GUI that would let you you know basically virtually build electronic logic circuits with gates and flip-flops and clocks.

384
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:51,820
Speaker 0: and you know voltage ground light bulb.

385
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:54,619
Speaker 0: You know little LCD displays with numbers on them.

386
00:29:55,001 --> 00:30:01,280
Speaker 0: You know all the basic circuitry without having to get out your breadboard or your soldering iron or any of that bullshit, right?

387
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,233
Speaker 0: You could just do it right on your screen with your mouse and keyboard because I you know Even though I went to school 20 years ago.

388
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:11,880
Speaker 0: It wasn't Right And it saves the school a lot of money.

389
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,880
Speaker 0: You don't have to buy have a whole electronics lab full of you know all these supplying all the students with gates and everything.

390
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,538
Speaker 0: You know, it's like everyone can just do it home all they want, right?

391
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:27,080
Speaker 0: So, you know, I haven't seen an app like that like around practice haven't looked for one.

392
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,254
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's plenty to choose from But I discovered this one recently, I don't know how old it is.

393
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:35,463
Speaker 0: it might be around for a while But it's new to me.

394
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,031
Speaker 0: It's a website called logic dot Lee.

395
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:41,020
Speaker 0: logically, but the dot goes after the C, right?

396
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:43,189
Speaker 0: And their app cost $60.

397
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:46,826
Speaker 0: It is not free But they have a free demo.

398
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:49,655
Speaker 0: you just logically dot logic dot Lee slash demo.

399
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:57,880
Speaker 0: that lets you use the app In some limited extent for free, but it even though it is a very limited extent it runs in a browser.

400
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,190
Speaker 0: It runs beautifully.

401
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,122
Speaker 0: It looks like a desktop app and It's.

402
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:16,730
Speaker 0: I really don't see why you need more features than what I see in this demo if your purpose is to learn The basics of electronic logic right which is all you would really want to do with this I see.

403
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:25,280
Speaker 0: if your flip-flops Yeah So yeah, I mean you you know, it's like even if you just need a refresher on like how the different kinds of flip-flops work.

404
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:37,820
Speaker 0: It's like you could just pull one out and mess around with it and be like oh, yeah That's how it works right hook up some light bulbs to the outputs And you know hook up some clocks and switches and power to the inputs, and you'll you know you figure it out, right?

405
00:31:38,340 --> 00:32:02,652
Speaker 0: So yeah, if you you know and also, I guess if you're a student Getting started you know in the computer science land right or electronic engineering land or anything like that if Your school did not teach this to you, or it's maybe recommending some other app this app might be Worth it to you, and you know if you're really doing a lot of this kind of stuff You know maybe the $60 might even be worth it.

406
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:06,755
Speaker 0: if you're like actually designing circuits You know for some projects or something right?

407
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:07,359
Speaker 1: Yeah?

408
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:12,860
Speaker 1: I did looks like actually I like the simulation option that it just it traces the path of all the logic.

409
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's way better than the app that we had in.

410
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,800
Speaker 0: oh yeah, and it's in a web, and it's in a web browser.

411
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:22,160
Speaker 0: So there you go.

412
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,792
Speaker 0: I just thought it was really cool, and I think it is really.

413
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:29,230
Speaker 0: if anyone knows there's a better one Let me know cuz you know, but does it there?

414
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,800
Speaker 0: my I imagine there's probably better ones that run on the desktop.

415
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:34,815
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's better ones that are in a browser.

416
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:46,883
Speaker 1: right yeah This reminds me a lot of a very similar app I use in like inside of Atlassian confluence to draw like flow diagrams like almost the exact same user Interface.

417
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:48,690
Speaker 0: oh like yeah, but that's just.

418
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,155
Speaker 0: those are just just something like.

419
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:51,320
Speaker 0: yeah, it doesn't simulate.

420
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is actually you know simulating the electricity.

421
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,473
Speaker 0: right you're making the actual circuit.

422
00:32:58,115 --> 00:32:58,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is cool stuff.

423
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,614
Speaker 1: all right in the moment We're just hanging out in quarantine.

424
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:02,300
Speaker 1: stay tuned.

425
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,670
Speaker 1: We're gonna be appearing at a bunch of online conventions And we're as many as we can work our way into.

426
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,433
Speaker 0: we'll figure it out.

427
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess we'll do.

428
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,773
Speaker 0: Pat We'll figure write some panels.

429
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:12,218
Speaker 0: I don't know.

430
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:13,083
Speaker 1: yeah I got.

431
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,859
Speaker 1: we got to put in the rest of the packs online ones at least I got to put in the new one.

432
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,024
Speaker 1: you and I were talking about it.

433
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,634
Speaker 0: the packs online panel submissions are live.

434
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:25,476
Speaker 0: so if you're out there and You have never ever done a panel out of packs.

435
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,885
Speaker 0: Maybe you live somewhere You don't have enough money or whatever.

436
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,611
Speaker 0: you don't have the means to go to a packs.

437
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:30,373
Speaker 0: right.

438
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,328
Speaker 0: you have any panel idea whatsoever Right?

439
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,628
Speaker 0: I highly recommend Submitting a panel submission to packs online.

440
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have nothing to lose.

441
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:40,958
Speaker 0: There's no penalty for getting rejected.

442
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:45,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, worst case They say sorry we can't fit you in this year cost nothing to submit right.

443
00:33:45,756 --> 00:34:05,960
Speaker 0: so submit B. There's gonna be a lot of acceptances because packs online is gonna be so many days long right That they're going to need content to fill it up, so I'm willing to bet I don't have confirmation of this But I'm willing to bet that Content that would not be accepted at an actual in-person packs where time and space are more limited.

444
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll be more likely to be accepted to packs online Like we're submitting like.

445
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:21,239
Speaker 1: so you know we're submitting our normal kind of stuff But we're gonna submit some weird or like some forward-thinking types of panels that we normally wouldn't even bother trying to submit to packs right.

446
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:26,074
Speaker 0: And lastly it could be you know your chance to like get out there right?

447
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,058
Speaker 0: so you know.

448
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,320
Speaker 0: maybe You you know you're not someone like us who's like a media podcast II person who's got like a thing to say.

449
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:36,760
Speaker 0: Maybe you're just making maybe you made a tiny little indie game, right?

450
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,119
Speaker 1: It's like do a panel and promote it.

451
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,203
Speaker 0: You can get free promotion Just you know.

452
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,862
Speaker 0: find some way to spin it to make it look like your panels not just an advertisement for your little indie Game.

453
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:48,800
Speaker 0: right and go out there, right?

454
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,143
Speaker 0: Make it happen.

455
00:34:51,185 --> 00:35:03,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're passionate about a title like a genre of you like saying you play 18xx games And that's your whole life I'll bet a panel just explaining what the deal is with those and like walking through like the history of them would probably I would Go to a panel like that.

456
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:06,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I've played enough 18xx that I could do that panel.

457
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:12,080
Speaker 0: But there's people who are way deep in 18xx is their only thing in life, and they are the ones who should do that panel.

458
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:16,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, we will focus on the panels where we actually have some expertise right?

459
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,599
Speaker 0: It's like there's a lot that I could do, but I want you know there's only some that I should do.

460
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,553
Speaker 0: So it's like think about what you should do right.

461
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,182
Speaker 0: because guess what you can yep and you know.

462
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:41,124
Speaker 1: even if like I know some people who have submitted panels to packs for like a People who read those submissions at packs and other kinds like it like they notice a lot of times you might be surprised They'll see.

463
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:42,740
Speaker 1: felt like I used to run a panels department.

464
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:46,934
Speaker 1: I'd look through submissions And I'd see panel ideas that I thought were cool that I couldn't fit in.

465
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:52,617
Speaker 1: but over the years I'd see like oh that same person keeps submitting that idea that I think is cool that I can't fit in.

466
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:54,223
Speaker 1: and one year I was like you know what fuck it.

467
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:59,180
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make room for that dude who submitted this panel on mushing for like five years.

468
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,427
Speaker 1: I'm gonna put it in the schedule.

469
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,613
Speaker 0: so the panel.

470
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,464
Speaker 0: not enough people went to it But I went to it.

471
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,269
Speaker 0: that panel was good.

472
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,040
Speaker 1: Yeah that I wish I could have gone to it.

473
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,463
Speaker 1: I was busy.

474
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:07,851
Speaker 0: a lot of dog pics.

475
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:13,254
Speaker 1: if I recall correctly I was sidelined dealing with a convention crisis during that panel.

476
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:14,358
Speaker 0: dumb dumb dumb.

477
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:24,580
Speaker 1: But convention crisis on the scale of real-life crisis is the equivalent of someone spilled some water like it's not Kids crying because Markiplier is not here whatever.

478
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,188
Speaker 1: All right, yeah, otherwise YouTube discord all that stuff.

479
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:28,829
Speaker 1: Let's get into it.

480
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:43,100
Speaker 1: There is a lot of technology that oh yeah people assume based on nothing is Obsolete, but in fact is widely used and not only not obsolete, but still like very important, right?

481
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,354
Speaker 0: So I'm you know I thought of this because I was thinking about the earlier picture.

482
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:48,664
Speaker 1: I put up on the screen is MIDI Right.

483
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:57,928
Speaker 0: yeah the earlier news I thought about you know cuz like you know with the micro four-thirds dying right and it now it's like sort of obsolete But also it's like hey actually this that stuff.

484
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:10,863
Speaker 0: It still totally works right and it's totally still useful But there's nothing wrong with it right and I look around and it's like actually you know it's like some technology is truly Obsolete like there is.

485
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:14,754
Speaker 0: you know it had its time and it is just worse right.

486
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:17,120
Speaker 0: for example the five and a quarter floppy drive.

487
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,746
Speaker 0: Right it is just worse.

488
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:23,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, and any other kind of storage the movable removable store I know.

489
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,173
Speaker 1: second a three and a quarter inch floppy appear.

490
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:32,169
Speaker 1: three and a half three and a half five and a quarter three and Not that that knowledge matters anymore.

491
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,273
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

492
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:35,480
Speaker 1: That's how I was that there was my dumb mnemonic.

493
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,812
Speaker 1: I always remembered five and a quarter three and a half and I met.

494
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:50,700
Speaker 0: only purpose today of a five and a quarter drive and disk is to Operate if just for historical museum curation preservation purposes, right?

495
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:59,159
Speaker 0: For places that still have old hardware being used yeah that could be could and should be replaced But for some reason they just haven't upgraded yet.

496
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, but but it's what.

497
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,395
Speaker 1: that's the difference.

498
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:08,375
Speaker 1: or something that is Obsolete, but is still being used as opposed to something that is not actually obsolete.

499
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:10,160
Speaker 1: You just think it's obsolete, right?

500
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:20,210
Speaker 0: So something that you think is obsolete, but is not actually obsolete for example the CRT Tube right yeah, so it's like okay.

501
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,240
Speaker 0: You know LCD screens are pretty much mostly just better.

502
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,600
Speaker 0: Why would you still want a tube right television?

503
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,468
Speaker 1: Do you need an extremely high refresh rate for some reason?

504
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:38,149
Speaker 0: right so they are making LCDs these days with extremely high refresh rates Right, but this they still have.

505
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:38,891
Speaker 0: this sort of like.

506
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:46,268
Speaker 0: you know small amount of lag that goes on right and The amount of lag that you get.

507
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:50,826
Speaker 0: you know if you got like a GameCube, but you want to play smash melee It's like you need a CRT.

508
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:54,740
Speaker 0: You can't just can't even on an LCD with like no pre-processing bullshit.

509
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:55,683
Speaker 0: It's like.

510
00:38:56,025 --> 00:39:01,775
Speaker 0: it is noticeably significant to the point where people who aren't crazy can tell No, that's what I would say.

511
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:07,240
Speaker 1: the reason It's not obsolete even though that might sound very similar to the example where you said something is obsolete like a museum.

512
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:22,468
Speaker 1: I think the difference is people there is a current need to actively play these games and non CRT technology cannot Completely 100% handle that use case Mm-hmm once they're in.

513
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:28,567
Speaker 1: if they the future there's a plasma display or an LCD that is 100% as good as the CRT for that use case.

514
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:31,696
Speaker 1: that nanosecond CRTs are now obsolete in that realm forever.

515
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,926
Speaker 0: Yep Another thing related.

516
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,552
Speaker 0: right it's like analog film right.

517
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:38,937
Speaker 0: it's like you think oh analog film.

518
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:39,740
Speaker 0: Why would you use that?

519
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,231
Speaker 0: It's just worse right except actually it's not just worse.

520
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:50,294
Speaker 0: the resolution on analog film is actually insane Right compared to the resolution of even the best digital cameras around.

521
00:39:50,375 --> 00:40:00,465
Speaker 0: obviously if you get like a digital Medium format camera the resolution is so insane that you're not going to improve on that with analog right, but actually cost wise Right.

522
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:14,137
Speaker 0: so to get a full-frame Camera, you know with a really high resolution sensor costs many thousands of dollars You can go to the drugstore and still buy a disposable 35 millimeter film camera.

523
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:21,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, and That has the same size sensor as like a you know Nikon d4.

524
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,594
Speaker 1: we don't want to derail the show by talking about film grain and how they're right.

525
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:26,359
Speaker 1: ultimately a resolution on like.

526
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:26,740
Speaker 1: it's not.

527
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:28,740
Speaker 0: There is ultimately a resolution.

528
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:41,240
Speaker 0: But the point is you know the the even though the power of it has been you know of analog film has been obsoleted by Digital cameras, it's so much cheaper, right?

529
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:53,620
Speaker 1: Well like regular old cassette tapes were not as obsolete by better technology existing because they were still a like accessible means of accessing audio recording technology to consumers.

530
00:40:54,423 --> 00:41:02,126
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm like when other came out because that's we're not obsolete because I couldn't record to a CD Cassette tape was the only way I could record anything.

531
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:08,803
Speaker 1: because that's we're not obsolete until well well into the CD our era Correct.

532
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:15,626
Speaker 1: and this is a nuance that a lot of people who aren't close to specific technologies Really like lose track of.

533
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:30,520
Speaker 1: like it amazes me how many people even like people who are our age This isn't like an old young thing who just assume tech they haven't seen in a while is obsolete Especially when it comes to things like development frameworks Like yeah Java Web Start that sucks, right?

534
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:37,060
Speaker 1: There are still cases where Java Web Start or the successors of Java Web Start make sense.

535
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,229
Speaker 1: They're not obsolete yet.

536
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:41,201
Speaker 1: They're just not preferred Mm-hmm.

537
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:42,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all.

538
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,912
Speaker 0: if you're not about software that's not obsolete.

539
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:46,276
Speaker 0: Oh boy, right?

540
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,480
Speaker 0: There's there's tons, right?

541
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,728
Speaker 0: It's like there's weird image formats.

542
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,699
Speaker 0: Like, you know that it's like oh you think oh, we'll just use JPEGs.

543
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:53,221
Speaker 0: now I have.

544
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:55,940
Speaker 0: it's like what do we need these other, you know image confirm?

545
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,159
Speaker 0: It's like no, there's still a time and a place for for a bitmap for a tiff.

546
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:10,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it's like all these old things or all these video codecs and formats like another thing we can't get deep into but There are video.

547
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:18,139
Speaker 1: when you think most people when they think of video codecs What they're actually thinking of is the container format and inside of that container are audio and video like codecs.

548
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,213
Speaker 1: I'm really oversimplifying here.

549
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:26,097
Speaker 1: a Huge variety of those exist and a lot of them are in wide use for a lot of reasons.

550
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:33,620
Speaker 1: some things are Extremely low CPU usage like they don't need a lot of power to decode but they're very large instead.

551
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,995
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of trade-offs there.

552
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:37,867
Speaker 1: Or like your your film camera example.

553
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:43,900
Speaker 1: another example of where you might want a film camera or where there's a use case for them Is the requirement to photograph?

554
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,212
Speaker 1: Phenomena in a place that has an extreme amount of electromagnetic radiation.

555
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:51,999
Speaker 1: that would prevent a modern digital camera from functioning.

556
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:58,820
Speaker 1: Mmm, but a physical camera with only physical mechanisms and film could take photographs in such an environment?

557
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:00,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

558
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,025
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

559
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what I run into the most that I think is the funniest.

560
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:10,416
Speaker 1: and even in high school I ran into people who tried to tell me that MIDI was obsolete like MIDI MIDI MIDI.

561
00:43:10,477 --> 00:43:17,216
Speaker 0: actually MIDI 2.0 Came out and is vastly superior but MIDI one is used extensively in modern music production.

562
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,520
Speaker 0: MIDI is everywhere.

563
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,405
Speaker 0: You can't avoid it.

564
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:25,940
Speaker 0: if you actually go to music studios, especially songwriters Those sorts of people it's like there's just MIDI everywhere.

565
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,597
Speaker 0: It's just like outside of the music industry like studios recording studios that set of place.

566
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:32,440
Speaker 0: It's like you don't see the MIDI.

567
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,565
Speaker 0: Yep, right because maybe you could.

568
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:42,411
Speaker 0: it's weird because MIDI used to be a thing that was in everyone's computers in like the 90s And it was removed from everyone's computer.

569
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,180
Speaker 0: All right, cuz we don't need it anymore.

570
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:45,218
Speaker 0: We just have you know.

571
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:53,528
Speaker 1: But wave my computer still has it because I have pro audio equipment and I have two MIDI keyboards Sure, but most people's computers does not.

572
00:43:53,608 --> 00:44:04,899
Speaker 0: most people will have some sort of software that would if you happen to get a MIDI file And wanted to play it would somehow play it right, but you know used to have a Sound Blaster 16 that had MIDI hardware in it.

573
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the only is the all 32 audio in your game, right?

574
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,386
Speaker 0: The audio in chips challenge was MIDI files and it would basically, you know Your chips challenge.

575
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:22,052
Speaker 0: when you played chip challenge on Windows 3.1 It wasn't playing a recording of a song it would actually.

576
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:34,939
Speaker 0: it was as if there was a digital keyboard Like a Casio keyboard in your computer and chips challenge would play that keyboard Right, like a player piano like like a player piano this while the game was running.

577
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,692
Speaker 0: But it doesn't work that way anymore.

578
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:39,480
Speaker 1: So this is like MIDI is a good example.

579
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,585
Speaker 1: I want to go a little deeper in like.

580
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:42,073
Speaker 1: why is MIDI not obsolete?

581
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,488
Speaker 1: because if you look at the actual protocol I mean MIDI 2.0.

582
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:52,660
Speaker 1: It came out recently, but Five years ago ten years ago 20 years like MIDI has survived through the ages.

583
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:58,754
Speaker 0: But if you ever using the first time I saw MIDI actually I mean MIDI is so old that they were using.

584
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:01,936
Speaker 1: when I was in elementary school I was fucking around with MIDI on my 486, right?

585
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,344
Speaker 0: I mean I saw.

586
00:45:03,364 --> 00:45:06,280
Speaker 0: the first time I saw it really set up for music production.

587
00:45:06,401 --> 00:45:11,947
Speaker 0: I had seen it for music on a computer but for the production in high school The there was.

588
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:14,880
Speaker 0: if you took the music theory class instead of going in band.

589
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:22,206
Speaker 0: They had keyboards with MIDI and computers and stuff, but but I there was a kid I knew I think he's that I don't know what happened to him.

590
00:45:22,246 --> 00:45:24,440
Speaker 0: I think he's must be a conductor or some shit somewhere.

591
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:30,275
Speaker 0: But like when I was in it was like my my parents friends kid.

592
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:38,420
Speaker 0: and even when he was like young He was like that violin playing conducting Prodigy kind of kid, right, you know that kind.

593
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:42,997
Speaker 0: And in his house, he had a Commodore 64 with MIDI hooked up.

594
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:51,780
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, I wasn't until the 486 era But I had a MIDI keyboard connected to my 486 and I was trying to compose music and playing around with it.

595
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:56,815
Speaker 1: if you read the spec MIDI seems archaic to the point that it's laughable.

596
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:06,220
Speaker 1: but Among all the way all the proprietary ways people tried to do the simple task of synchronize a bunch of separate instruments together electronically.

597
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:17,859
Speaker 1: MIDI was the generic format that could work with everything and become a standard because all it really is is a means to Signal basically a piano roll to or from any number of it.

598
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,703
Speaker 1: Well, not any number.

599
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:22,780
Speaker 1: there was a limited MIDI because this is old technology an arbitrary number of devices.

600
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:27,374
Speaker 1: MIDI is also used for things like controlling lights and effects on stages.

601
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:39,551
Speaker 1: as a result because MIDI you can plug an Arduino in a MIDI controller and program something to be like if I hit this key on my keyboard it lights up a light bulb somewhere or does something on my computer like.

602
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:42,799
Speaker 1: MIDI is an extensible and really useful protocol.

603
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:49,152
Speaker 1: and Because it's so low-level and so generic But that makes it very obtuse to learn the details of.

604
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,660
Speaker 1: it's difficult to learn how to use MIDI correctly.

605
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:55,600
Speaker 1: It's more it's easy to learn how to use MIDI to accomplish a task.

606
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,135
Speaker 1: It's hard to learn how many works at the low level because you have to learn a lot of old archaic crap.

607
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,134
Speaker 0: I found I just you know, the That person that I just mentioned.

608
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:15,120
Speaker 0: Yeah Assistant conductor at New York Philharmonic It's definitely the right person because it says they made their conducting debut at age 11 with the Greater Bridgeport Youth Orchestra.

609
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,328
Speaker 0: So it's definitely the same person.

610
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:22,500
Speaker 0: so yeah, I guess they went on to go do what they wanted to do good for that person.

611
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

612
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:26,196
Speaker 1: Now there is a weird case of technology.

613
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:32,436
Speaker 1: That is Obsolete but necessary but still in use but no one will ever change it like.

614
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:46,400
Speaker 1: there's an a gray area I'm thinking about is like nuclear weapon control Because that's a weird case where the old technology is Objectively obsolete like to the point of ridiculousness like we're talking 8-inch floppies.

615
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:53,196
Speaker 1: If you've never heard of an 8-inch floppy, there's a reason that is ancient compared to five and a quarter floppies.

616
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:54,700
Speaker 0: Yes, but it works.

617
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,852
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and why are you gonna replace it?

618
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:57,435
Speaker 0: It's working.

619
00:47:57,495 --> 00:47:59,726
Speaker 0: It's still working But you could replace like.

620
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:01,894
Speaker 0: they probably have a giant room full of giant computers.

621
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:03,360
Speaker 0: They could replace with one computer.

622
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:05,831
Speaker 0: But why would you go through the effort?

623
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:06,896
Speaker 0: you have this thing that works.

624
00:48:06,956 --> 00:48:07,820
Speaker 0: it's sitting there running.

625
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:10,694
Speaker 0: It's doing its very very important job.

626
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:11,780
Speaker 0: very very well.

627
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:20,668
Speaker 0: I don't fuck with it for no reason other than to use less computers, but the fact that it's obsolete Introduced became a feature.

628
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:30,387
Speaker 1: It's so obsolete that it makes it Extremely difficult to hack or mess with that kind of system Like the amount of expertise you could use.

629
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:33,539
Speaker 1: you would need to fuck with a system that is as archaic as that.

630
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:38,060
Speaker 1: Became a feature effectively for this extremely narrow use case.

631
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,486
Speaker 1: Mmm, like so Galactica like it's that.

632
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:42,910
Speaker 1: it's that situation exactly.

633
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:51,020
Speaker 0: There's also similar use cases relating to not the Like places on earth or different people's, you know life, right?

634
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,467
Speaker 0: So it's like think about something like an iPod.

635
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:59,707
Speaker 0: right an iPod is pretty much obsolete because there are just better Portable music playing devices like.

636
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:06,420
Speaker 0: even the shittiest Android phone with the shittiest UI is Gonna have like a music playing app on it.

637
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,000
Speaker 0: We'll have more storage than an iPod probably more battery life have a better user interface right than an old iPod, right?

638
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,860
Speaker 0: So it's like why would you why would you want the old iPod right?

639
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:24,780
Speaker 0: It's like well actually The old iPod could be gotten cheaper and people live in a poor place or the battery will last longer.

640
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,606
Speaker 1: Oh, look Sony still makes Walkman.

641
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:28,915
Speaker 1: There's mp3 players 8 gigabytes of storage.

642
00:49:28,955 --> 00:49:30,380
Speaker 1: That's pathetic compared to a smartphone.

643
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:32,859
Speaker 1: I get my an Android phone for a quarter this price.

644
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,648
Speaker 0: Maybe it's.

645
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:36,240
Speaker 0: maybe the iPod is lighter.

646
00:49:36,722 --> 00:49:38,008
Speaker 0: Right because it's you know, it's not.

647
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:48,168
Speaker 0: the super old ones won't be because they have spinning drives in them But yeah, I had one of those I guess but like an iPod nano is gonna be smaller than any Are about the size of an SD card.

648
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:50,094
Speaker 0: They're like a tiny little clip.

649
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:58,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're basically iPod shuffle situation Which if you're running biking you just want to bring some music with you But you want it to be as light and unobtrusive as possible.

650
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:01,343
Speaker 1: There's still a use case for that Thing.

651
00:50:01,423 --> 00:50:03,511
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, I guess Apple watch does it.

652
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:10,580
Speaker 0: it's also yeah, but you know You get the idea is like something that like, you know, it's like oh this has no purpose anymore.

653
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,482
Speaker 0: It has been defeated.

654
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:19,367
Speaker 0: But actually if you have a specific case for it, right where you're you're doing a weird thing Right, maybe you're even.

655
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:22,340
Speaker 0: maybe you're going camping and just want to carry a light load.

656
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, suddenly it makes sense.

657
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:52,399
Speaker 1: like another example when DVD came out it made The purchasing of read-only VHS tapes completely obsolete like overnight especially because the ps2 coming out rapidly increasing adoption and driving down the price of a DVD player, but No one until really the computer era had an accessible means of recording a TV show The time shift it like until we had TiVo's and things like that.

658
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:01,270
Speaker 1: VHS was the only way to do that and thus VHS was not only not obsolete But was in active use way later than you might realize.

659
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:07,479
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like way longer longevity than the cassette in a lot of ways.

660
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:20,660
Speaker 0: You also have some cases where someone has a piece of technology that is so Expensive relative to their wealth, right so that they can't really replace it easily or they wouldn't want to write.

661
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:28,180
Speaker 1: So like all my old firewire audio equipment if I if I didn't have enough money to upgrade all of that I would still be using all that old firewire audio equipment.

662
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:31,332
Speaker 0: Well, not just that but like let's say but it is obsolete.

663
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:33,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but let's say you have a car, right?

664
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,446
Speaker 0: It's like you don't want to buy.

665
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,378
Speaker 0: just buy a new car, right?

666
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,413
Speaker 0: Each I mean assuming you're you're in car land, right?

667
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:41,860
Speaker 0: You have no choice or whatever, right?

668
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,978
Speaker 0: Because you shouldn't buy a car.

669
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:45,880
Speaker 0: But you got an old car and it still works.

670
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,305
Speaker 0: There's no reason to replace it.

671
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:51,120
Speaker 0: doing so will be expensive even though there are better newer cars, right?

672
00:51:51,680 --> 00:52:00,229
Speaker 0: so this car is so old that it doesn't have like an aux audio input or You know an iPhone Bluetooth integration is an old car.

673
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,700
Speaker 0: So you using like an FM transmit II thing.

674
00:52:04,043 --> 00:52:10,173
Speaker 0: That's an obsolete technology But because you've got an old car right with no reason to replace it.

675
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:14,768
Speaker 0: you still need that old obsolete Technology to use.

676
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:16,897
Speaker 0: you can hear music from your new iPhone.

677
00:52:16,977 --> 00:52:27,754
Speaker 1: as a kid I had a device that was an 8-track tape and you could put it into a car a track player and then in the back Of it it had a slot to slide in a regular cassette tape.

678
00:52:28,336 --> 00:52:34,360
Speaker 0: I had one that was Cassette tape and on the outside of it came a wire that you would plug into your iPod.

679
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:39,179
Speaker 0: I had one of those too and you put it into the cassette tape part of the.

680
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:50,899
Speaker 1: But I guess The real point I think I can make around this concept because we're just exploring this concept to see if we can come up with like more narrow show ideas taking up one.

681
00:52:51,840 --> 00:53:03,272
Speaker 1: Technology that is specialized and solves a niche problem tends to have a lot more longevity Because there are very few people Willing and able to try to solve those problems.

682
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,919
Speaker 1: MIDI solved the problem well enough.

683
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:10,355
Speaker 1: Nobody really had a vested interest in making something that fully covered the use cases of MIDI.

684
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:18,520
Speaker 1: if anything large companies Have an interest in making a competing proprietary format and trying to steal market share over to their bullshit proprietary platform, right?

685
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,792
Speaker 0: It's just because there's something better right doesn't mean it's better.

686
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:23,594
Speaker 0: You can't.

687
00:53:23,674 --> 00:53:26,424
Speaker 0: it's very hard to unseat something That's good enough.

688
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:33,120
Speaker 0: if something's that's at the current thing that's out There is kind of sucky and has lots of problems, right?

689
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:36,732
Speaker 0: Then it is very easy to unseat it with something vastly superior.

690
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:39,180
Speaker 0: They were it was easy to unseat VHS with DVD.

691
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,798
Speaker 0: Yeah for read-only it was not so easy to unseat DVD with booray.

692
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:48,932
Speaker 0: Yeah Well in a lot of ways DVD is still sort out there kind of a little bit.

693
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's not.

694
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:55,832
Speaker 0: it's not totally dead It's more it's less dead like VHS was when DVD came around.

695
00:53:55,953 --> 00:54:00,839
Speaker 1: set-top DVD writers never displaced VHS recorders.

696
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,499
Speaker 1: No computers did that instead.

697
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:08,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but the other thing I could say is that You can.

698
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:09,564
Speaker 1: generally.

699
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:11,589
Speaker 1: this is just like a generalized piece of advice.

700
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:21,700
Speaker 1: You can make a very good career out of Understanding Something that a lot of people think is obsolete, but in fact is widely used.

701
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,972
Speaker 1: Like that is a way to guarantee you will have a job for the rest of your life.

702
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:42,126
Speaker 0: I think the last thing is that the Regardless of how much you know computers the actual silicon right is replaced with faster smaller more energy-efficient silicon IO devices are largely Unaffected right.

703
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:46,368
Speaker 0: It's like it's like oh, okay So I got a camera with a better sensor.

704
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:51,870
Speaker 0: the sensor is the silicon right I do a newer better digital camera Lenses or lenses man, right?

705
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:53,980
Speaker 0: Oh, I got a brand new awesome computer.

706
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:56,919
Speaker 0: Well, your mouse is your mouse and your keyboards your keyboard, right?

707
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:04,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know your your webcam is I guess, you know once once we got like modern laser mice or like modern optical mice.

708
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:08,920
Speaker 1: There's not a lot more advancement that's gonna happen there anytime soon, right?

709
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:14,160
Speaker 0: It's like a microphones a microphone, you know, I mean look we can do the stars a guitar speaker.

710
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:21,080
Speaker 1: We we did the show until like four years ago with the same microphone that Lyndon Johnson used to give presidential addresses, right?

711
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,180
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you can get some fancy new amp with fancy silicon in it, right?

712
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:32,241
Speaker 0: You can upgrade that part and then your speakers from your studio in the 70s are probably going to be almost as great as brand New speakers.

713
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's speakers just figures figures right.

714
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:38,080
Speaker 0: audio, you know video in out audio in out.

715
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:42,258
Speaker 0: it's like those accessories.

716
00:55:42,278 --> 00:55:48,360
Speaker 0: and You know ancillary devices your headphones, you know that shit does not go out of style.

717
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,571
Speaker 0: It's really hard to replace it because all of those things are good enough.

718
00:55:52,852 --> 00:56:02,476
Speaker 1: Yep, and material science advances are not Destabilizing enough like yeah, they're slightly lighter drivers and modern monitor headphones, but they're not.

719
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:04,962
Speaker 1: it's not like a revolution Right.

720
00:56:05,022 --> 00:56:10,617
Speaker 0: and Moore's law, you know pushed silicon right to obsolete many many generations.

721
00:56:11,058 --> 00:56:16,495
Speaker 0: very rapidly Right, you know, but now it's Moore's laws kind of slow now.

722
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:21,933
Speaker 0: So even the silicon obsolete this obsolation is slower than it used to be.

723
00:56:22,134 --> 00:56:35,514
Speaker 1: so, uh, I just Googled for obsolete technology and there's a Wikipedia article that is literally called List of obsolete technology and it's a list of technology and what replaced it.

724
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:44,880
Speaker 1: and then if it's still used for anything and the Number one is bathing machine Replacement no longer required due to changing social standards of morality.

725
00:56:46,543 --> 00:56:46,824
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

726
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:48,371
Speaker 1: old obsolete technology.

727
00:56:48,391 --> 00:56:50,279
Speaker 1: hourglass replacement clock.

728
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,850
Speaker 1: Correct sundial replacement clock.

729
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,740
Speaker 1: swamp cooler replacement air conditioning.

730
00:56:57,322 --> 00:57:00,974
Speaker 1: Still used for dry climates because they're way more efficient.

731
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:02,599
Speaker 1: if you live somewhere you could use them.

732
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:05,131
Speaker 1: Yep, this is all linked to this.

733
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:07,000
Speaker 1: This is actually a really interesting list.

734
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,988
Speaker 1: I wish I'd googled this at the beginning.

735
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,739
Speaker 1: We could have probably driven a lot more conversation by looking at this thing.

736
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:14,216
Speaker 0: Even even think about sundials.

737
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:16,752
Speaker 1: beer replacement firearms.

738
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:19,379
Speaker 1: sword replacement firearms.

739
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:27,008
Speaker 1: Sure Forts replacement vulnerable to air attack.

740
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:39,267
Speaker 0: I think this Wikipedia article does not have a lot of editors maybe listeners, I want all the listeners to go to this Wikipedia article and Everyone make one change to it.

741
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,635
Speaker 0: I'll do I'll make I'll make one change to it.

742
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:42,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll make one as well.

743
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,047
Speaker 0: Everyone make one edit to this Wikipedia page.

744
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:52,770
Speaker 0: It'll be like a brigade regaining of a one Wikipedia article, but no Don't play don't vandalize put real like a real update right here.

745
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,879
Speaker 0: do an honest real update to this page.

Speaker 0: as rim Send me a link to the page.

747
00:57:57,365 --> 00:58:03,200

748
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:07,300
Speaker 1: Ocean liner replaced by airliner.

749

760
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:16,450
Speaker 1: I just uploaded like 12 more standalone and live anime reviews that I'm gonna slowly trickle out on YouTube.

761
00:59:16,892 --> 00:59:19,023
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll post all of them in the patreon earlier.

762
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:20,249
Speaker 1: I got to figure that out.

763
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:23,750
Speaker 1: I did as promised start some pre-production on the utana episode.

764
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:26,909
Speaker 1: I think we have a plan to be able to get that out this month.

765
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,859
Speaker 1: So stay tuned on that.

766
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:30,868

767
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:38,375
Speaker 1: My you'll see what I mean, but basically I'm gonna mostly make the thing myself, but Scott's gonna record his own Independent analysis.

768
00:59:38,436 --> 00:59:39,419
Speaker 1: I'm gonna cut back and forth.

769
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,423
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna work.

770
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:46,668
Speaker 1: You'll see maybe it won't but It's really hard to do a show like that over discord, so we're gonna do the best we can.

771
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:48,917
Speaker 1: Anyway, stay safe out there.

772
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:51,910
Speaker 1: and here's something that is best left forgotten.

773
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:58,545
Speaker 0: Well years ago a nine-tailed fox suddenly appeared.

774
00:59:59,187 --> 01:00:15,102
Speaker 1: if you believe it I Am a ninja clan ninja clan.

775
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:16,689
Speaker 0: here we stand Naruto.

776
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:19,258
Speaker 0: I'm on my way Naruto.

777
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,449
Speaker 0: I'll be okay getting ready to fight on set.

778
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,476
Speaker 0: Come on best friends by my side.

779
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:37,128
Speaker 0: sasuke is really cool Sakura the beautiful Oh.
