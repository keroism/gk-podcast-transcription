1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,628
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 27th.

2
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:12,693
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:13,415
Speaker 1: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,560
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,540
Speaker 0: Tonight on the manga front, we preview Emma and Ode to Kirihito.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,234
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:30,000
Speaker 0: So we almost didn't do a show tonight because we're tired and we're planning for our New Year's bash.

8
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:33,312
Speaker 1: And it's much later than we usually record shows.

9
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:36,407
Speaker 1: I mean usually we would have been done recording about now, but we're just starting.

10
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:37,534
Speaker 0: See we were on track.

11
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:38,400
Speaker 0: We were all set to go.

12
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:51,045
Speaker 0: I stopped at the home despot to pick up a new key for the house because a bunch of people are coming over and I figured some of them need keys in case we're not here because people are staying longer than the party as our parties tend to go.

13
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,399
Speaker 1: Some people are getting here before the party which means we have to go to work and they have to stay here.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,383
Speaker 1: They might want a key.

15
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,135
Speaker 0: And some people are staying long after the party.

16
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:01,394
Speaker 1: And some people really like bats in Zelda.

17
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:01,980
Speaker 1: They need some keys.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,726
Speaker 0: That was pretty sad.

19
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:05,328
Speaker 1: What do you want?

20
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:06,232
Speaker 0: I don't know that really hurt.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,340
Speaker 0: That hurt me in a profound way Scott.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,957
Speaker 1: But anyone who got, see the thing is that was a bad joke, but anyone who got it is awesome.

23
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:12,540
Speaker 0: That is true.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,369
Speaker 0: But in addition to that, all right, so that's good.

25
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:15,891
Speaker 0: I come home.

26
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:17,197
Speaker 0: We're cooking dinner.

27
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:17,820
Speaker 0: We're ready to go.

28
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:28,108
Speaker 0: Our friend Alex comes over and instead of doing all the stuff we were gonna do we end up hanging out with him and watching a bunch of Ghost in the Shell and basically dicking around for several hours.

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,052
Speaker 1: Like two.

30
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:34,091
Speaker 0: In addition to me doing laundry, then finding out the key didn't work and Scott needed butter.

31
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:38,059
Speaker 0: So we go out on the road again and now it's 1030 and we haven't even started the show.

32
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,082
Speaker 1: It's 1021.

33
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:40,828
Speaker 1: We're starting the show right now.

34
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:41,671
Speaker 0: It's 1027.

35
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,236
Speaker 1: That's good enough.

36
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:43,898
Speaker 1: It's but not 1030 yet.

37
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:46,742
Speaker 1: Yet.

38
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:48,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

39
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,295
Speaker 0: I guess we could just bust right into the news.

40
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's bust right into this business.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:10,737
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'm reading this article here that was on the Anime News Network where all anime news comes from and it's from Business Standard, which I guess is some big-time newspaper in India and the article says "Indian bookstores are stacking up with graphic novels in the Japanese

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,159
Speaker 1: genre.".

43
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:16,600
Speaker 1: And I said, "Oh, you know, we always keep thinking about Japan and the U.S.

44
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:23,206
Speaker 1: and we don't think, you know, we keep seeing all this Japanese culture coming over to the U.S You know, the sushi already came over.

45
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,534
Speaker 1: You know, the anime has pretty much come over.

46
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,400
Speaker 1: The manga is coming over pretty strong.

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:35,240
Speaker 1: They're just selling us all their culture, but we don't really think that Japan or anyone else so much exporting the culture elsewhere.

48
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,220
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't read articles about manga in South Africa or popularity of manga in Russia.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,886
Speaker 1: So this really kind of opened my eyes to, "Hey, manga is popular in India.

50
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,031
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

51
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:49,960
Speaker 1: I should have realized that before.

52
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,308
Speaker 1: I wonder where else manga is popular besides U.S.

53
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,655
Speaker 1: and India and maybe Britain and

54
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,057
Speaker 1: Canada.".

55
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:57,160
Speaker 0: I'd imagine France.

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,423
Speaker 1: I imagine Mexico.

57
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:02,518
Speaker 1: Cause anime's always been- There's probably some big-time manga going down in Mexico and South America.

58
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:02,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,639
Speaker 1: Possibly the France.

60
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:05,702
Speaker 0: You know what?

61
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:14,126
Speaker 0: I hate to say it, but I get a feeling that what a lot of what you'd find in Mexico would be- Remember all those Chinese comics we found at the shore?

62
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:19,523
Speaker 1: I don't know, because Dragon Ball was real big in the Spanish-speaking You know what?

63
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:23,540
Speaker 0: Dragon Ball is honestly a lot like those Chinese comics.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, I remember Dragon Ball was always on the Spanish, you know, channel on the cable network where I lived and it was really popular.

65
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:36,060
Speaker 1: And I always, like Hispanic kids that I knew, were always Dragon Ballers.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,870
Speaker 0: Well, I remember Anime World Orders always talking, because they were asking a while ago about, you know, people in different countries and how they watch anime.

67
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,846
Speaker 0: And they've gotten a bunch of responses that I don't remember, so I can't say anything about them.

68
00:03:47,027 --> 00:04:00,383
Speaker 1: The other interesting thing about this article is after they talk about how, you know, manga is so popular in India and it's getting bigger and stuff, they list some manga that you should buy and their recommendations are excellent.

69
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,490
Speaker 1: The first recommendation is Akira.

70
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,032
Speaker 0: Of course.

71
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:03,936
Speaker 1: Followed by Buddha.

72
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:04,457
Speaker 0: Of course.

73
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:05,200
Speaker 0: Crying Freeman.

74
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,500
Speaker 1: Yep.

75
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,644
Speaker 1: Lone Wolf and Cub.

76
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:10,796
Speaker 1: And then Othello, which I think I've seen in the stores and never run, never read.

77
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:17,702
Speaker 1: It's some j-rock teen manga, but the first four were all hardcore, real-deal mangas.

78
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:28,120
Speaker 1: And I think it's pretty cool that, you know, over here, it's the schoolgirl crap that's popular, but apparently over there in the big-time newspaper in India, they're pushing the good stuff.

79
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,640
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the reason the- Kazuo Koikei's and the Tezuka's and the Otomo's.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,095
Speaker 0: You know, whenever I hear Koikei's name, I can't help but laugh.

81
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,100
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with his name.

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,989
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen a picture of Kazuo Koikei?

83
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,672
Speaker 0: No, I haven't.

84
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,260
Speaker 1: You should go look because you'd laugh two times.

85
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,200
Speaker 0: I don't need that in my life.

86
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do.

87
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:52,838
Speaker 0: I laugh enough at the content of all that he has done and the vibe I get from that classic, magical name.

88
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:54,578
Speaker 0: That man.

89
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,707
Speaker 0: It's kind of like with Robin Williams.

90
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:06,674
Speaker 0: No matter what he does, no matter what role he's playing, no matter what the situation is, it could be a World War II movie and genocide everything.

91
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:12,180
Speaker 0: If I see Robin Williams, I can't help but laugh or at least suppress a laugh.

92
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,483
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

93
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:20,280
Speaker 0: I just can't help but laugh when I see him, and I can't help but laugh when I hear about Koikei.

94
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,180
Speaker 1: That's him on the left, on the right.

95
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,996
Speaker 0: You know, in a sick way, he looks exactly the way a man like that should.

96
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:28,060
Speaker 1: I like the beard.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,949
Speaker 1: The beard really puts the whole thing together.

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:38,860
Speaker 1: Especially with the glasses, he reminds me of someone- He's sort of like got like this Buddha-shaped head with this like a sort of American-style like gray old man hair.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,856
Speaker 0: These little tiny circle glasses, his big nose- You know what he kind of reminds me of?

100
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:44,940
Speaker 0: Ichijima.

101
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:46,985
Speaker 0: Eh, kinda.

102
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,154
Speaker 0: A little bit, like maybe a younger Ichijima.

103
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,097
Speaker 0: Maybe, maybe.

104
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:51,560
Speaker 0: Anyway.

105
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,259
Speaker 1: Oh, what's your news?

106
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,763
Speaker 1: Oh, that guy on the left?

107
00:05:58,944 --> 00:05:59,706
Speaker 1: That's Carl Horn.

108
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,652
Speaker 0: That's what Carl Horn looks like?

109
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:02,494
Speaker 1: Apparently.

110
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,460
Speaker 0: He doesn't look nearly as cool as Kazuo Koikei.

111
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,926
Speaker 1: No, he doesn't look cool at all.

112
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:09,080
Speaker 0: Granted, I think not many human beings look cooler than Kazuo Koikei.

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,808
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people look cooler than Kazuo Koikei.

114
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,273
Speaker 1: He doesn't look very cool, but- I don't know.

115
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,340
Speaker 1: He definitely looks like Kazuo Koikei does.

116
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,287
Speaker 0: Alright, so this is- I'll link this to anime, alright?

117
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:28,280
Speaker 0: This is something that, if it is followed all the way through, will allow more anime to be shown in America uncensored.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,124
Speaker 1: What?

119
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:29,599
Speaker 1: Okay.

120
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,509
Speaker 0: So the FCC is one of my most hated government entities in the United States.

121
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,240
Speaker 0: You see, they're responsible for pretty much anything that has to do with communications in the United States.

122
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:56,017
Speaker 1: Well, their original purpose was Congress said, "Hey, you know, this sucks that we have all these radio things, and they keep changing, and it sucks to have more than one person use the same frequency, so we need to find a way to dole out the frequencies, and we can't be bothered to do it ourselves.

123
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,079
Speaker 1: Let's make a federal agency to just take care of

124
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:58,199
Speaker 1: it.".

125
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,860
Speaker 1: And they did.

126
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,123
Speaker 0: Now, regulating that sort of thing is okay.

127
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:10,360
Speaker 0: I mean, you'd have to be quite a libertarian wackjob to argue against the idea that the airwaves should be at least moderated in some degree.

128
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, or otherwise they just become useless.

129
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,710
Speaker 0: It would just be absolute chaos.

130
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:19,820
Speaker 1: I mean, already on the borders of America- That's like saying there shouldn't be any traffic laws at all, just roads.

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:35,680
Speaker 0: I mean, already on the borders of America, particularly the southern border, there are radio stations in Mexico broadcasting at unbelievably powerful, powerful rates into the United States, because there's nothing we can do about it.

132
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,309
Speaker 1: Yep.

133
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,646
Speaker 0: And in fact, you're usually broadcasting American content.

134
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,900
Speaker 0: I learned that recently, and I found it hilarious from someone I know who's living down there.

135
00:07:47,120 --> 00:08:01,560
Speaker 0: But the FCC has grown to basically, in addition to regulating the airwaves, violating the First Amendment on a regular basis by censoring pretty much anything that is broadcast on any medium over which they have control.

136
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:08,308
Speaker 0: Now, the way they get around this is that they're not technically censoring because there is no prior restraint.

137
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:18,319
Speaker 0: They will never go to someone and say, "You can't say X on your radio show," or "You have to show us this crazy thing and then we'll say if it's okay or

138
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:18,520
Speaker 0: not.".

139
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,906
Speaker 0: In fact, they won't even say what's okay or not.

140
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:25,620
Speaker 0: There's actually no official public list of what's okay and what's not okay.

141
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,839
Speaker 1: Because if there was a public list, that would be blatantly against the First Amendment.

142
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:30,180
Speaker 1: censorship.

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,573
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,259
Speaker 1: And they can't do it.

145
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,128
Speaker 0: So they can't have the prior restraint or anything, and they can't have any sort of prior review either.

146
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,852
Speaker 0: So what they do is they just wait.

147
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:43,039
Speaker 0: And if Howard Stern accidentally says something that sounds like fuck...

148
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,375
Speaker 1: Well, he's not on the radio anymore, but...

149
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,760
Speaker 0: Remember, pretty much the only reason he actually left radio was because the FCC wouldn't leave him alone.

150
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,110
Speaker 1: Yeah.

151
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,000
Speaker 0: But I'll get to all that, because it's... I could do a whole show on this business.

152
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,354
Speaker 1: We could.

153
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:57,619
Speaker 0: We probably should.

154
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:58,400
Speaker 1: Eventually.

155
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,300
Speaker 0: Maybe, someday.

156
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:04,420
Speaker 0: So say he says fuck by accident, or someone calls in and says...

157
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,339
Speaker 1: Oh, he can say fuck!

158
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:06,723
Speaker 0: Ain't it great?

159
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,029
Speaker 0: Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.

160
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,697
Speaker 0: Okay, I got it out.

161
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:12,620
Speaker 0: I got them all out today.

162
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:13,359
Speaker 1: Alright, bitches.

163
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:18,049
Speaker 0: So someone calls in and says it on the show, or something happens.

164
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:21,899
Speaker 0: And the FCC can just come back and be like, "Yeah, that's a million dollar

165
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,200
Speaker 0: fine.".

166
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,069
Speaker 0: But he didn't violate any public rule.

167
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,640
Speaker 0: There was no official thing he wasn't allowed to do.

168
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,860
Speaker 0: They just decided, arbitrarily, after the fact, to fine him.

169
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:43,060
Speaker 0: And in fact, in many cases, they would make an arbitrary rule and wait a week until a radio show such as Howard Stern had violated that rule five, six, seven times, and hadn't been warned.

170
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,936
Speaker 0: And then suddenly they say, "Oh, by the way, million dollars per instance, and oh, you did it seven times this week.

171
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:49,999
Speaker 0: How about

172
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,240
Speaker 0: that?".

173
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:55,060
Speaker 0: And the worst part is that the FCC doesn't actually do any of this on their own.

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,280
Speaker 0: There is a very, very small number of right-wing Christian groups.

175
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,740
Speaker 0: And I forget, there's basically three groups, and you can find their names easily on the internet.

176
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,420
Speaker 1: There's like Parents something...

177
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,360
Speaker 0: The Parents Television Console, something like that.

178
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,639
Speaker 1: I don't know, there's a whole bunch of them.

179
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,440
Speaker 0: But there's like two or three big ones.

180
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,980
Speaker 0: And what they do is anytime, they watch TV, and when they find anything that they find offensive.

181
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,960
Speaker 0: You know, basically anything funny, interesting.

182
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,139
Speaker 1: So basically one person is watching television.

183
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:23,518
Speaker 1: Yeah.

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,640
Speaker 1: And then when they see something that they don't like, they tell all the other people who are just going about their daily lives that that show had something bad.

185
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:35,000
Speaker 1: And then all those people write letters to the FCC complaining.

186
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:35,719
Speaker 1: Most of them?

187
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
Speaker 1: The FCC gets a thousand letters.

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,271
Speaker 0: Most of them now are internet form letters.

189
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,500
Speaker 0: They're not even real letters.

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,096
Speaker 1: And they're all from the same, you know, it looks like, "Oh shit, we got a thousand letters about this show.

191
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,260
Speaker 1: We should go do something about

192
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,320
Speaker 1: it.".

193
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,760
Speaker 1: But really, it's from one group sending all those letters.

194
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,499
Speaker 0: Now not only that, that's horseshit right there.

195
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:02,600
Speaker 0: But they're unpublished, they're effectively censoring by just fucking you after the fact if you say the word "fuck" and taking away all your money and doing all these evil things.

196
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,598
Speaker 0: And they're totally getting away with it.

197
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:17,880
Speaker 0: Until now, the networks are starting to not take this anymore, especially with the fact that Sirius Radio and XM Radio, which aren't bound by FCC rules, are basically destroying terrestrial radio.

198
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,099
Speaker 1: And podcasting.

199
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,440
Speaker 0: Yes, podcasting too is destroying radio, so you're a part of this.

200
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,642
Speaker 1: I mean, think about it.

201
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:30,479
Speaker 1: You go out there, you know, and if you ask people on the street, most of them will say, "Yeah, kids shouldn't be listening to

202
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:30,660
Speaker 1: that.".

203
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:45,300
Speaker 1: But if you actually look at the listening and viewing habits of entertainment of most people in this country, violent, sexy, swearing stuff is what people want to see, it's what they pay to see, it's what more people go to see, it makes the big money.

204
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:46,897
Speaker 1: That's where it's at.

205
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,700
Speaker 1: The number of people who are actually, you know, against that stuff is a minority, not the majority.

206
00:11:54,322 --> 00:12:01,560
Speaker 0: And yet the FCC will find someone a million dollars based on the complaints of a thousand people, only one of whom probably actually saw the offending item.

207
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:12,578
Speaker 0: To cut a long story short, people have been taking the FCC to court, and it's starting to look like, in Gandalf's words, "We're at the turn of the

208
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:12,898
Speaker 0: tide.".

209
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:29,940
Speaker 0: Judges have basically been practically flat out yelling at the FCC and calling them out on all the things I just said, and how they're effectively using a loophole and pedantic arguments to get around the First Amendment and censor people to their heart's content.

210
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what they're doing.

211
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:43,400
Speaker 0: And if these judges are backed up by other judges, and if this gets to high courts, it may be that the FCC will lose its power of enforcing obscenity, decency, and blasphemy laws.

212
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,705
Speaker 1: That's bad news for us.

213
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:47,536
Speaker 1: People start listening to us through radio again.

214
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:48,500
Speaker 1: Oh, shits.

215
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:50,287
Speaker 0: What's in the news, Rob?

216
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:50,630
Speaker 1: Oh, Howard!

217
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,714
Speaker 0: I don't find Howard Stern funny at all.

218
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,540
Speaker 0: I'll say that straight up.

219
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,083
Speaker 1: I know.

220
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:04,300
Speaker 1: His TV show is okay because then you can see on the occasion when he does something crazy in the studio.

221
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,816
Speaker 1: Better than that is just a guy going, "Hey, I have a great radio voice.

222
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:07,997
Speaker 1: What's

223
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:08,239
Speaker 1: up?".

224
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,026
Speaker 0: You know how he has the great radio voice?

225
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:13,960
Speaker 0: He basically sticks the microphone in his mouth, down his throat, and into his lungs.

226
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,740
Speaker 1: He also has been a radio guy forever, and he trained to be that radio guy.

227
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,146
Speaker 0: But I think his show is pretty crap and pretty not funny.

228
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:29,960
Speaker 0: However, that man is one of the few people who is in a position to fight for the First Amendment and is fighting for the First Amendment at every opportunity.

229
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,920
Speaker 0: Things of the day!

230
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:39,700
Speaker 1: You wanna go first?

231
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:41,226
Speaker 0: Alright, I can go first.

232
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:43,720
Speaker 0: 'Cause mine is not in any way anime-related.

233
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:44,232
Speaker 1: Okay.

234
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:48,857
Speaker 1: I guess you could consider-- Mine is kind of Japanese, sorta.

235
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,840
Speaker 0: Well, it has a relevant anime-related anecdote.

236
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:53,018
Speaker 1: I guess.

237
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,820
Speaker 0: I mean, it almost changed the course of our lives.

238
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:57,959
Speaker 1: No, it didn't.

239
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did.

240
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,298
Speaker 1: Alright, well, I don't know what you're talking about, so.

241
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,380
Speaker 0: Alright, alright, so we're fans of Penn and Teller, the musical act, and we're-- The musical act, really?

242
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,720
Speaker 0: The kind of musical.

243
00:14:09,104 --> 00:14:09,376
Speaker 1: I don't know.

244
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:10,668
Speaker 0: Magical act!

245
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,319
Speaker 0: The magic act.

246
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,680
Speaker 0: And, you know, Penn Jillette, the dude, and Teller, the dude, 'cause they do that show.

247
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,060
Speaker 0: Bulls hit, or as we can say without the FCC breathing down our necks, bullshit.

248
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,140
Speaker 0: Well, one of the things they do is that they do pretty awesome magic.

249
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,620
Speaker 1: And unlike other magicians, they're not afraid to-- Unlike other magicians, they do their show every night.

250
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:37,440
Speaker 0: They're not afraid to reveal to the world exactly how they do their tricks.

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:47,340
Speaker 1: Well, some of the tricks they don't tell just because they want to keep the act-- They want to keep you coming to the show, 'cause if you know how they do everything, the show is not interesting anymore.

252
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,368
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but in general, they very much play the angle of, "We're doing tricks.

253
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,377
Speaker 0: See if you can figure it

254
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:52,640
Speaker 0: out.".

255
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,533
Speaker 0: Or, "Yeah, we did a crazy trick.

256
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:55,520
Speaker 0: There's no magic here.

257
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,398
Speaker 0: It's just a lot of work and effort and cool sleight of

258
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:58,700
Speaker 0: hand.".

259
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, "Hey, check out this cool trick I can

260
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:00,577
Speaker 1: do.".

261
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,972
Speaker 1: "Ah, isn't that entertaining?

262
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,340
Speaker 1: Good, you paid me for that entertainment.

263
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,431
Speaker 1: That's right, now I'm rich.

264
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:05,613
Speaker 1: Ha

265
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:05,977
Speaker 1: ha.".

266
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:14,799
Speaker 0: But a lot of times-- I mean, they've revealed many times exactly how tricks are done to the world, and a lot of other magicians have seemed to have gotten kind of mad about this.

267
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, there are the tricks that you can learn by going to any magic store, and there's just the book that tells you how to do it.

268
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,760
Speaker 1: They usually reveal the tricks that are just, like, one step above that.

269
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,880
Speaker 1: They never reveal, like, the big time stuff that, you know, the big time tricks that only super professional magicians know how to do.

270
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,138
Speaker 0: Well, pretty much the ones that only they do.

271
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,919
Speaker 1: Exactly.

272
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,196
Speaker 0: But they'll reveal someone else's trick.

273
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:34,619
Speaker 0: They don't care.

274
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,574
Speaker 1: I guess.

275
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:35,960
Speaker 1: Whatever.

276
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:46,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, but, I mean, one of the things is they point out that a good trick is one that is just as impressive if you know exactly how they do it, because then it's not a matter of, "Wow, how'd they do

277
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:47,080
Speaker 0: that?".

278
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,235
Speaker 0: It's a matter of, "Holy shit, they did

279
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:49,577
Speaker 0: that?".

280
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:50,463
Speaker 1: Yeah.

281
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:54,633
Speaker 1: It's also, you know, you look at the guy doing it, and you're like, "Whoa, that takes a lot of effort.

282
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,016
Speaker 1: I couldn't do

283
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:55,178
Speaker 1: that.".

284
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,420
Speaker 0: Yep, because they'll talk about how, like, a trick that takes ten seconds on stage takes fourteen hours of preparation.

285
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:01,017
Speaker 1: Yep.

286
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,700
Speaker 0: But this is a video from some show, and it doesn't matter.

287
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,580
Speaker 0: Just forget all, doesn't matter the context or anything.

288
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't worry why Regis Philbin's there.

289
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:09,840
Speaker 1: Just ignore him.

290
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,459
Speaker 0: They show you a trick, and then they do the trick again where everything's transparent so you can see exactly how they did it.

291
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:24,299
Speaker 0: Granted, it wasn't the biggest trick, and if you have any amount of brain, you'll figure out exactly how they did the trick well before they show you how they did the trick.

292
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:32,820
Speaker 1: It's funny because they have this music that plays when they do the trick, and then the lyrics to the song change when they show you the trick revealed, and it's pretty hilarious.

293
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,679
Speaker 0: If by hilarious you mean so lame it hurts.

294
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Speaker 1: In other words, hilarious.

295
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Speaker 1: It's so lame that it's actually funny.

296
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,260
Speaker 0: Right, so get to your semi-anime-related thing of the day.

297
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,480
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm bringing it back with a thing of the day classic.

298
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,057
Speaker 1: We need a thing of the day classic here.

299
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,360
Speaker 1: Lightning, lightning.

300
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,384
Speaker 1: This thing of the day is from, God, 2000?

301
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,020
Speaker 0: We were freshmen in college.

302
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,840
Speaker 1: It had to be the year 2000.

303
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,619
Speaker 1: We're not exactly sure what it is.

304
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,540
Speaker 1: We're pretty sure it's a trailer, not a trailer.

305
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,660
Speaker 0: A trailer for an epic movie.

306
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:16,859
Speaker 1: It's a pilot for a Japanese sitcom or comedy sketch show that never got turned into a real show, but it's in English.

307
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:21,378
Speaker 1: All the actors speak in English, and there's some Japanese subtitles going on.

308
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:25,380
Speaker 1: And yeah, October 20th, the year 2000.

309
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,119
Speaker 1: Pilot Tokyo Breakfast.

310
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,920
Speaker 1: Now you might already know what this is because it's been around for seven years.

311
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,499
Speaker 1: But you might not know what it is.

312
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,215
Speaker 1: Let me tell you.

313
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:42,000
Speaker 1: It is a six-minute long comedy sketch involving a Tokyo family with a mom, a dad, a grandpa, a son, and a daughter.

314
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,140
Speaker 1: And it is so racist, good God.

315
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:48,060
Speaker 0: You think you know racism?

316
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,160
Speaker 1: You think you know racism?

317
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:54,040
Speaker 1: I am a fan of the type of comedy done by people such as Richard Pryor.

318
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,644
Speaker 1: You know, "Black man do this.

319
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,390
Speaker 1: White man does that.

320
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,035
Speaker 1: Black man do this.

321
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:00,479
Speaker 1: White man does

322
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:00,720
Speaker 1: that.".

323
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,160
Speaker 1: And that's a little bit racist, but it's not insulting racist.

324
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,380
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, that's a racial stereotype, and it is funny to think about it.

325
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,820
Speaker 1: This is so racist.

326
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:17,700
Speaker 1: I guess it's not KKK racist, but it's more racist than people are in their everyday lives.

327
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:20,055
Speaker 1: It crosses the line to where you go, "Whoa,

328
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:20,418
Speaker 1: dude.".

329
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:27,214
Speaker 1: If someone acted like this, like hanging out with you, you'd be like, "Oh, dude, you can't be doing that.

330
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:27,597
Speaker 1: That's not

331
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:27,879
Speaker 1: cool.".

332
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,482
Speaker 0: Yeah.

333
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:33,793
Speaker 0: Now granted, we saw this RIT and for a while we all sat around and we're like, "Is this funny or

334
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:34,138
Speaker 0: wrong?".

335
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,815
Speaker 0: And we laughed at half of it and half of it, and we're just like,

336
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:36,936
Speaker 0: "Wow.".

337
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:46,040
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because nowadays it's all hilarious because I've seen it so many times, the racism effect doesn't work on me anymore.

338
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,417
Speaker 0: You gotta reveal what it is at all or should we just let people see it?

339
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,958
Speaker 1: It's Japanese people speaking English, being racist, and funny.

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,602
Speaker 0: Yeah.

341
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:00,380
Speaker 0: Well, I'll just put it this way.

342
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,620
Speaker 0: The way that this almost changed our lives is that we were freshmen and we all watched it, and then the next day we all went to anime club.

343
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:17,000
Speaker 0: And after anime club, we're standing in tape checkout, and one of us yells out to our group in the corner one of the taglines from this little sketch comedy.

344
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,997
Speaker 0: And then the rest of us shout back, "We

345
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:21,580
Speaker 0: did!".

346
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:29,758
Speaker 0: And we do a little bit from it and we're all laughing, and the administration of the club comes down, and they almost kicked us out of club right there.

347
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,740
Speaker 0: Granted, it wasn't the first time they'd tried to kick us out of club.

348
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,980
Speaker 1: You failed everything except animation.

349
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:40,400
Speaker 1: Okay.

350
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:48,280
Speaker 0: If you are offended by racism to an extreme level, I highly recommend you do not watch this.

351
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:57,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you are the kind of person who watches white men do this, black men do that comedy, and you do not find it funny, and you're all insulted, you're going to be super insulted at this.

352
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,266
Speaker 0: But granted, this isn't that bad.

353
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:01,620
Speaker 0: It's not like, I don't know, ku klux ken evil.

354
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,700
Speaker 1: It's not ku klux ken evil, no.

355
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,487
Speaker 0: It's not that bad.

356
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:08,360
Speaker 0: It's just not that good either.

357
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,199
Speaker 0: But it is kind of funny.

358
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,566
Speaker 1: It's really funny.

359
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,335
Speaker 1: Especially at the end.

360
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,260
Speaker 1: The end is hilarious.

361
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,468
Speaker 1: Like the joke, it's a running gag.

362
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:19,240
Speaker 1: The same racist joke pervades the whole six minutes.

363
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:29,540
Speaker 1: But there's a couple of other jokes that come up in the middle of it, and then at the end, there's a super payoff, even if the joke gets wearing thin in the middle.

364
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,409
Speaker 0: Like it wears thin to the most it could wear thin, and then, I don't know, they must have just found this guy on the street and been like, "You American, come

365
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:36,631
Speaker 0: here.".

366
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,157
Speaker 1: We need a gaijin for our pilot.

367
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:40,539
Speaker 1: Get here.

368
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:43,895
Speaker 0: I imagine they just gave this guy like 10,000 yen.

369
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,534
Speaker 0: They're like, "Say this line and carry this

370
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:46,897
Speaker 0: box.".

371
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:48,664
Speaker 1: Alright, that's enough.

372
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:52,799
Speaker 1: This is a classic thing of the day that we hold dear, and you should all see it.

373
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a tiny piece of front row crew history.

374
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,908
Speaker 0: You see, that was from before.

375
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,540
Speaker 0: funny internet videos were easy to come by.

376
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:00,871
Speaker 1: It was, it was.

377
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,600
Speaker 1: You are correct.

378
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:11,460
Speaker 0: I mean, you could go to College Humor, which had like- I think the only things competing with this were all your base and- Uh, maybe Hyaku Goju-Ichi, but I think that was actually later.

379
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that was later.

380
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,240
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

381
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,418
Speaker 1: I had to go look at the dates.

382
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is, I mean, there was no YouTube back then.

383
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:26,780
Speaker 0: If you found something funny on the internet, you could guarantee that everyone you knew would see the exact same video and you would laugh about it hysterically because it was the only entertainment you had.

384
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, and finding out about it was even more difficult because there weren't even blogs back then.

385
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,938
Speaker 1: I mean, Slashdot was the only thing you had.

386
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:36,179
Speaker 0: God, I started reading Slashdot when I got to RIT.

387
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,799
Speaker 1: I read Slashdot like a few months before I got to RIT, but I started really reading it when I got to RIT.

388
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,459
Speaker 0: Right, so we were gonna do the show on Initial D.

389
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,239
Speaker 1: Which is gonna be a great show.

390
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,340
Speaker 0: However, since it's late and we're tired, we were not prepared to put forth the requisite effort to do Initial D justice.

391
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaker 1: Initial D requires great justice.

392
00:21:56,542 --> 00:22:13,238
Speaker 1: You may or may not like our take on Initial D, but suffice to say- I have a feeling it is an area of contention with the other anime podcasts and most anime fans out there with our stance on Initial D.

393
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:19,837
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that we're going to win that battle, not in the first place or the second place, but in the third place.

394
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,035
Speaker 1: Not in the straightaways or the corners, but in the third place.

395
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,580
Speaker 1: But we're not talking about that today.

396
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,058
Speaker 1: No, we're not talking about Initial D. We're gonna do a two for two.

397
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,860
Speaker 0: Kinda like the old format of the show before we switched it up a bit.

398
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,907
Speaker 0: So this is kind of a throwback to the way Geek Nights was, I don't know, 220 episodes ago.

399
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rem's gonna do one manga, and I'm gonna do one manga, and then we're gonna go to fucking bed.

400
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not really reviewing, so don't worry about that.

401
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,531
Speaker 0: No spoilers or anything.

402
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:54,213
Speaker 0: This is more of a preview, meaning we're gonna basically let you know- Like, "Hey, I read this manga.

403
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:54,477
Speaker 1: Check it

404
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:54,659
Speaker 1: out.".

405
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:58,558
Speaker 0: -if this is the kind of thing you would like and if it was the kind of thing that we'd like.

406
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,415
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

407
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:02,880
Speaker 0: And Scott's is very highbrow, I guess.

408
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:04,059
Speaker 1: And yours is mediumbrow.

409
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely not lowbrow.

410
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,660
Speaker 1: No, it's not lowbrow.

411
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:06,892
Speaker 1: No.

412
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,080
Speaker 0: All right, you wanna go first?

413
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,683
Speaker 1: I don't know.

414
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:10,533
Speaker 1: Mine's bigger than yours.

415
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:11,140
Speaker 1: I should go second.

416
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,220
Speaker 0: All right, mine's really little, so... That'll be taken out of context.

417
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:17,498
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

418
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:26,700
Speaker 0: Right, so for Christmas, in addition to another amazing gift, Emily got me a copy of Emma, which is a manga by Kaoru Mori, who is a woman.

419
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,899
Speaker 0: A lot of people think that the manga artist here is a man.

420
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,793
Speaker 0: Numerous people have stated as such, and that's not true.

421
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:34,120
Speaker 0: It's a woman.

422
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:48,800
Speaker 1: See, I knew about this because I watched part of the first episode of the fan sub of the anime, and then I found out it was a manga, and all I knew about it was that it was a manga about maids, but it was not a perverted manga about maids.

423
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,659
Speaker 1: It was seriously about maids.

424
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, you know most crap anime, like, a character's dressed as a maid.

425
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,359
Speaker 0: Paromatic.

426
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,099
Speaker 0: Only they're all, like, pink or something, and then they have sex with each other, or something horrible.

427
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,758
Speaker 1: Every hentai.

428
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:07,300
Speaker 0: Emma is set, and this is how Emily actually sold it to me, by telling me about this way, way even before.

429
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:14,718
Speaker 0: It's a show about maids that's set in Victorian England, and is actually about realistically portrayed maids.

430
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,227
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,120
Speaker 0: Like, it's a straight up drama, romantic comedy.

432
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,940
Speaker 0: None of that, no perversion, none of that stupid crap.

433
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:25,120
Speaker 1: No revealing cleavage, no up skirts.

434
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:28,740
Speaker 0: It's a period piece that is generally very faithful to the period.

435
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:37,480
Speaker 0: I mean, as faithful as something like this can be, and apparently the mangaka is actually, I guess I would describe her as an anglophile.

436
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:40,220
Speaker 0: That might be an understatement.

437
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:47,879
Speaker 0: She really freaking likes England, and English history, and this era, and she is super super super into this, according to everything I read about her.

438
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:54,575
Speaker 0: And according to the things she writes about herself, in the little, uh, hello, welcome to my manga bit at the end of this.

439
00:24:55,161 --> 00:25:03,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I noticed that in a lot of manga, uh, like at the end of every volume, there'd be like a couple, you know, like a few pages of just silly manga.

440
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,907
Speaker 1: Like, hee hee hee.

441
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,297
Speaker 1: Like Fullmetal Alchemist has it, Trigon has it.

442
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:06,439
Speaker 1: Yep.

443
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,699
Speaker 1: You know, uh, I wonder what's up with that.

444
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,351
Speaker 1: Like, you don't see that.

445
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,272
Speaker 1: It's not a convention from American comics.

446
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:12,980
Speaker 0: And you know what?

447
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,746
Speaker 0: I really like it.

448
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,531
Speaker 1: I do like it, but I'm just saying I wonder where that came from.

449
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:17,480
Speaker 1: I'd like to learn more about it.

450
00:25:17,722 --> 00:25:24,840
Speaker 0: I will say this, the after manga, or the afterword manga in Emma, is absolutely hilarious.

451
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,603
Speaker 0: Kinda like the, uh, uh, Cromartie after manga.

452
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:28,026
Speaker 0: I don't know.

453
00:25:28,046 --> 00:25:30,370
Speaker 1: It's tough to compete with the Fullmetal Alchemist after manga.

454
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:30,939
Speaker 0: I don't know.

455
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,172
Speaker 1: Is that what we're gonna call it?

456
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:32,780
Speaker 1: The after manga?

457
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,534
Speaker 1: Someone tell us the correct word.

458
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,120
Speaker 1: I feel bad.

459
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:38,431
Speaker 0: Well, it's called afterword manga in Emma.

460
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:39,299
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fun.

461
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:43,100
Speaker 0: It's also called Gentleman's Fancy Maids in Black.

462
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:46,075
Speaker 0: And then there's the word "theme" and an arrow pointing at it.

463
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:55,379
Speaker 0: Uh, and just a little bit here, there's these funny Indian girls who don't talk, and they're probably one of the funniest bits in this manga so far.

464
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:59,195
Speaker 0: And the mangaka is like, "No one gets the purpose of the Indian

465
00:25:59,235 --> 00:25:59,498
Speaker 0: girls.".

466
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:02,857
Speaker 0: And then a little text at the bottom, "Actually, I just kinda like this kind of

467
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:03,200
Speaker 0: character.".

468
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:08,124
Speaker 0: But Emma is the story of a maid.

469
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:13,080
Speaker 0: A pretty, uh, but, you know, pretty but plain maid in the typical maid sense, I guess.

470
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:21,580
Speaker 0: And in addition, a young gentleman named William, who is wealthy, but not a nobleman, but wealthy enough to where he can have all the pretensions of a nobleman.

471
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:24,780
Speaker 0: and he's young and his father is a wealthy, wealthy, wealthy businessman.

472
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,532
Speaker 1: And she's their maid?

473
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,239
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

474
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:27,824
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

475
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,580
Speaker 0: She's the maid of a friend of the family.

476
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,042
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

477
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:32,493
Speaker 0: And there's a few other characters.

478
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:38,108
Speaker 0: There's this really funny, hilarious Indian prince who comes and stays with him for a while and all this stuff.

479
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:43,480
Speaker 0: And it's basically just a cute, charming love story set in the period.

480
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:48,791
Speaker 0: I mean, I could go on in much more detail, but I really don't want to ruin anything about this.

481
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,489
Speaker 0: It's heartwarming.

482
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,945
Speaker 0: At times, it's serious.

483
00:26:52,390 --> 00:27:02,430
Speaker 0: It's mostly funny but not in the stupid slapstick funny but more in the subtle kind of, uh, very underplayed and well executed humor.

484
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,539
Speaker 1: Give an example of a joke.

485
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,047
Speaker 0: Well, like, whenever, you know, William obviously fancies this girl, Emma.

486
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:11,120
Speaker 0: It's obvious from the start and it's actually portrayed kind of realistically.

487
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,763
Speaker 0: You know, when two people are really, like, they like each other.

488
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,108
Speaker 1: Well, in those days, they had to be all courting and shit.

489
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,299
Speaker 0: So they're a little flirty but they can't be too flirty and, like, you accidentally touch hands then you're both blushing back away.

490
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,653
Speaker 1: That's the anime for you.

491
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:31,037
Speaker 0: But the way it is portrayed and the way it is drawn and the way they talk to each other while they're doing this is just really fun.

492
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,904
Speaker 0: Like, the expressions on the character's faces really make it.

493
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:34,793
Speaker 0: Kind of like in Nana.

494
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:38,208
Speaker 0: How half of Nana's humor is just the way the character's faces change.

495
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,440
Speaker 1: With those perfectly circular eyes or the dot in the middle, like,

496
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:41,723
Speaker 1: "Oh?".

497
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, this doesn't do that.

498
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:48,572
Speaker 0: It does for really big eyes and characters on frame but they're looking down.

499
00:27:48,653 --> 00:28:04,299
Speaker 0: or they're looking up or their eyes are cocked to the side and for some reason that with tiny realistic sweat drops together and charming dialogue are kind of this, it's funny but not in a laugh out loud way but in a, you're generally amused at all points.

500
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:05,642
Speaker 0: Yes.

501
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:13,119
Speaker 0: Of course, this is interspersed by periodic moments of absolute crazy comedy gold.

502
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,140
Speaker 0: I'll ruin this because this isn't a big deal.

503
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,609
Speaker 0: This Indian prince who is actually friends with William comes to visit.

504
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:19,880
Speaker 0: Incognito.

505
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,019
Speaker 0: And by incognito meaning the next day the newspaper prince that he is visiting, incognito.

506
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:28,085
Speaker 1: Awesome.

507
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:32,107
Speaker 0: And then, you know, he gets off and he's got all these elephants with him because he's royalty.

508
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,983
Speaker 0: He can bring elephants with him.

509
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:34,893
Speaker 0: He's got these elephants.

510
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:38,372
Speaker 0: And William is like, "You can't bring elephants into my house.

511
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:39,665
Speaker 0: You can't bring them here.

512
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:40,292
Speaker 0: This is

513
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:40,817
Speaker 0: dangerous.".

514
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:44,008
Speaker 0: And the prince is like, "Elephants are perfectly docile and

515
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:44,433
Speaker 0: peaceful.".

516
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:51,140
Speaker 0: While he's saying this, one of the elephants goes berserk and starts attacking people and going on a rampage.

517
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:54,453
Speaker 0: And the whole time, he's chasing it down and trying to stop it.

518
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:57,626
Speaker 0: He's yelling back to William like, "This never happens.

519
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,980
Speaker 0: They're perfectly peaceful.

520
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,619
Speaker 0: Nothing bad ever happens.

521
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:02,272
Speaker 1: This, this, blah blah

522
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:02,555
Speaker 1: blah.".

523
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:10,916
Speaker 1: Do you think that the mangaka was, you know, recognized that the maid fetish existed and sort of made this to be like, "Ha ha!

524
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:11,299
Speaker 1: Look at that!

525
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,064
Speaker 1: Take that,

526
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:12,409
Speaker 1: bitches!".

527
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:15,520
Speaker 0: I get the impression that the mangaka has a maid fetish.

528
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:16,304
Speaker 1: Oh.

529
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:16,916
Speaker 1: Okay.

530
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,580
Speaker 1: I thought it was more of like a, you know, "You crazy maid cafe people!

531
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:24,952
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make a maid manga that's serious and then you'll buy it by accident.

532
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:25,316
Speaker 1: Take that,

533
00:29:25,356 --> 00:29:25,638
Speaker 1: bitches!".

534
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:26,226
Speaker 0: Well, no.

535
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:33,240
Speaker 0: She also did something else called Shirley, apparently, according to Wikipedia, which is also set in the similar time period.

536
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,866
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

537
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:42,513
Speaker 0: And if you read the little after manga, she basically is like, "I really like maids, and I really like England, and I wanted to make a manga about

538
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:42,634
Speaker 0: it.".

539
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:48,617
Speaker 0: And she gets really, really excited about little things like, the littlest, So it's basically a fangirl made this?

540
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:48,880
Speaker 1: Yes.

541
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:49,325
Speaker 1: Okay.

542
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:50,120
Speaker 1: Cool.

543
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,272
Speaker 0: I don't want to ruin any more.

544
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,048
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about it in depth.

545
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:59,100
Speaker 0: I can't think of a single human being who wouldn't enjoy reading Emma.

546
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,679
Speaker 0: They might not like enough to buy it all.

547
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:02,379
Speaker 0: Might not like enough to even buy it.

548
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,940
Speaker 0: But if you get a chance, read the first volume of Emma, and I guarantee you'll smirk at least a couple times, and come out of it being enjoyed, being enjoyed?

549
00:30:11,341 --> 00:30:13,104
Speaker 0: Come out of it feeling very happy.

550
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,223
Speaker 1: There's also an anime.

551
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:15,830
Speaker 1: Yes.

552
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:16,436
Speaker 1: Pretty new.

553
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:16,820
Speaker 1: Real new.

554
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:25,736
Speaker 0: I haven't seen the anime at all, but I looked at some screen captures that compared it to scenes in the manga, and at least as far as the style is concerned, they are dead on.

555
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,194
Speaker 0: Dead freaking on.

556
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,083
Speaker 0: Kind of like Indiana.

557
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:29,770
Speaker 1: Alright.

558
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,377
Speaker 1: Alright.

559
00:30:30,457 --> 00:30:33,773
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you about something that you might not know exists.

560
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,055
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you're either in the category of people who are like, "How could you not know about

561
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:38,379
Speaker 1: that?".

562
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:39,651
Speaker 1: It's, like, obvious.

563
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:42,540
Speaker 1: Or you're in the category of people with, "What the fuck are you talking about?

564
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,328
Speaker 1: I never heard of that in my

565
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:43,570
Speaker 1: life.".

566
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:50,019
Speaker 1: I'm gonna talk about Ode to Kirihito by the god of manga, Osamu Tezuka.

567
00:30:50,660 --> 00:31:04,260
Speaker 1: Now, this, it's from vertical publishing, which is the same people who's publishing Buddha, and they're publishing Tutera, and the Guin Saga, and basically they publish all the really really highbrow manga.

568
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:05,166
Speaker 1: All of it.

569
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:06,100
Speaker 1: Most of it, anyway.

570
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:09,020
Speaker 1: Whatever they have that someone else didn't already publish.

571
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,404
Speaker 1: Now, Ode to Kirihito is something that has never been in English, ever.

572
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,879
Speaker 1: It was written in, let's see, what year does this say?

573
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,861
Speaker 1: 1970 and 1971.

574
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:25,778
Speaker 1: It was published by Osamu Tezuka in Bigu Komiku Shogakan.

575
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,516
Speaker 1: And it didn't get here until now.

576
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,612
Speaker 1: Ode to Kirihito is one giant manga.

577
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:34,460
Speaker 1: It's all one book.

578
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,175
Speaker 1: You can't buy separate volumes of it.

579
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,972
Speaker 0: It's one of those "hit someone over the head with it" books.

580
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:38,760
Speaker 1: It's pretty big.

581
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,440
Speaker 1: I mean, it takes up your whole hand.

582
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:41,671
Speaker 1: It's kinda hard.

583
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,873
Speaker 1: This thing's like two inches thick, what are you saying?

584
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:44,580
Speaker 1: Two and a half, maybe?

585
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,003
Speaker 0: More than that.

586
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:45,629
Speaker 1: Yeah.

587
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,740
Speaker 0: But at least it's bound well.

588
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:47,750
Speaker 0: Not like Erze Asura.

589
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not gonna fall apart when you read this thing.

590
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:53,851
Speaker 1: It's also got a pretty cool cover where this thing slides back and forth.

591
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,406
Speaker 1: It's really a high quality production.

592
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:59,479
Speaker 1: Of course, it is $25, but I got it at a discount because I'm awesome.

593
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:09,508
Speaker 1: It is a medical drama from 1970, before shows like ER and whatever other medical dramas you watch today existed.

594
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:18,660
Speaker 1: You know, you read stuff like Blackjack, which is also by Tezuka, or you play Trauma Center, or what other medical dramas are out there.

595
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:19,651
Speaker 1: I can't even think of any.

596
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,575
Speaker 1: But as far as I know, this house I don't know what house is.

597
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,700
Speaker 1: Is it a medical drama?

598
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:27,654
Speaker 0: I don't know, whatever.

599
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:34,036
Speaker 1: But this, it's like you know, you play Knifey Spoonie, like you know, oh, this is a knife.

600
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:35,873
Speaker 1: No, this is a knife.

601
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,160
Speaker 0: I see you've played Knifey Spoonie before.

602
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,520
Speaker 1: Someone comes up and says, this is a medical drama.

603
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:43,698
Speaker 1: I say, no, this is a medical drama.

604
00:32:44,903 --> 00:32:45,611
Speaker 1: Oh, Monster.

605
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:50,379
Speaker 1: Monster, if you read Ode to Kirihito, Monster is going to seem half as good as it is.

606
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:55,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're currently reading Monster, finish it before you pick this up.

607
00:32:55,692 --> 00:33:00,177
Speaker 1: That's right, because you're going to read this and then you're going to go back to Monster and be like, wow, that was a ripoff, wasn't it?

608
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,459
Speaker 1: Well, Monster's ripoff of this.

609
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,124
Speaker 1: Oh, and one other thing I just had to say before I tell you about what actually goes on in this manga, is that it is left to right, but it doesn't matter.

610
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:26,663
Speaker 1: You know, vertical doesn't seem to go along with the whole flipping the pages, well, not flipping the pages that you can read right to left, but if you can freaking read it, everything makes sense, you know, and the translations are of the highest quality and the fonts are really good.

611
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:32,039
Speaker 1: You can give this to someone and you know, they probably would never know that it was originally in Japanese.

612
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,187
Speaker 1: Well, I guess, you know, you can kind of tell from Tezuka's art style that it's kind of Japanese, but whatever.

613
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,540
Speaker 0: Or from the name Kirihito.

614
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:40,680
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, that would do it too.

615
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:42,785
Speaker 0: I mean, they could completely anglicize it, I guess.

616
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:44,885
Speaker 1: Or the fact that it says so right in front of the book.

617
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,089
Speaker 0: See, if they remade it, you know, and localized it, it'd be owed to John.

618
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,288
Speaker 1: Anyway, the story is about a doctor, Dr.

620
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,330
Speaker 1: Kirihito.

621
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,676
Speaker 1: Oh.

622
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:56,644
Speaker 1: And Dr.

623
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,239
Speaker 1: Kirihito is an awesome doctor.

624
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:01,894
Speaker 1: And basically, he's working on this patient.

625
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,200
Speaker 1: And this patient is in room 66.

626
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,422
Speaker 1: Dum, dum, dum.

627
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:12,219
Speaker 1: And the patient has a really strange disease that turned it into a beast of some sort.

628
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,672
Speaker 1: And his whole head is becoming malformed.

629
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:16,905
Speaker 1: He's growing hair all over.

630
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,925
Speaker 1: And he's basically becoming a horrible monster, and he's also dying.

631
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:29,309
Speaker 1: So the doctor is really struggling to discover more about this disease, find a cure for it, what causes it, et cetera.

632
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:37,409
Speaker 1: There's big arguments going on in the medical community, whether it's a virus, or a bacteria, or if it's endemic, or who knows.

633
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:47,454
Speaker 1: And it gets pretty intense, because people are all corrupt, you know, and they're trying to screw other people out of research, and you know, all kinds of stuff.

634
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:51,107
Speaker 1: Mishandling the patients, doing all sorts of shady dealings.

635
00:34:52,257 --> 00:35:07,308
Speaker 1: And basically, stuff, I don't want to know how much I want to go and spoil it, but the doctor ends up going on a crazy quest around the world in all sorts of different crazy situations, you know, that are very intense.

636
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:10,219
Speaker 1: Pretty much every moment is intense throughout this whole thing.

637
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:13,191
Speaker 1: You're constantly going, "What's going to happen now?

638
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,038
Speaker 1: What's going to happen

639
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:14,240
Speaker 1: there?".

640
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:16,956
Speaker 1: And it's wow.

641
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,060
Speaker 1: It's really heavy shit.

642
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,927
Speaker 1: Not only is the paper heavy, but the story is heavy as well.

643
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:23,533
Speaker 1: Well, consider this.

644
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:28,219
Speaker 0: Scott was reading it off and on while we were at the Northern Geek House having a party.

645
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:28,705
Speaker 0: Yep.

646
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:33,979
Speaker 0: And the fact that he could be distracted from a party by a manga says a lot.

647
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:46,585
Speaker 1: And not only is there the story of the doctor on his adventure around the world to, you know, deal with his problems, but there's all these other sort of peak characters that have their own story.

648
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:49,837
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there's the corrupt doctor still back in Japan.

649
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:50,645
Speaker 1: What's he doing?

650
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:56,930
Speaker 1: Then there's the, you know, the other kind of sketchy doctor who's kind of bad and kind of good.

651
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,638
Speaker 1: What's he up to?

652
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:05,667
Speaker 1: Then, you know, you've got his quest to find the disease, but you've also got his wife or his fiancé.

653
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,460
Speaker 1: What's she doing?

654
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,320
Speaker 1: stuck in Japan after he ran away?

655
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:11,250
Speaker 1: You know, and all this crazy stuff goes on.

656
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:15,309
Speaker 1: And in the end, after the end of how many pages of this freaking thing?

657
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:16,460
Speaker 0: A lot.

658
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:17,348
Speaker 0: I would wager 600.

659
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:19,728
Speaker 0: It's 822 pages.

660
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:20,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was close.

661
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,652
Speaker 1: They actually managed to tie everything together.

662
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:24,400
Speaker 1: It's like a miracle.

663
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:25,507
Speaker 1: Damn.

664
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:31,066
Speaker 1: And you've got to read, when you're reading this thing, not only do you have to realize, this whole thing is by Osamu Tezuka, one guy.

665
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:31,900
Speaker 1: Art and story.

666
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:34,020
Speaker 1: You know, just like all of other Tezuka's works.

667
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:42,243
Speaker 1: But if you've read other Tezuka stuff like Buddha or Phoenix or Astro Boy, I've read a lot of it.

668
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:45,939
Speaker 1: And this, I'd have to say is the most polished of all of them.

669
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,439
Speaker 1: You know, the other ones have a few, you know, silly bits here.

670
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:53,174
Speaker 1: Or they have, you know, some kind of sketchy stuff there.

671
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,546
Speaker 1: Sometimes something doesn't make complete sense in one spot or another.

672
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:59,229
Speaker 1: This is freaking polished.

673
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,506
Speaker 1: It's as if he wrote the whole thing and double checked everything and made sure it was all perfect.

674
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:11,480
Speaker 1: And I don't know, I don't know if it's the best Tezuka work, because Phoenix is just so much more epic in its scope.

675
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:17,360
Speaker 1: But the quality level is the same if the plot is not as epic.

676
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:28,769
Speaker 1: If you like doctors or, you know, I don't know, science fiction stories that are, you know, all giving you a big message.

677
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,672
Speaker 0: If you like dramas and thrillers.

678
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:31,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

679
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:33,640
Speaker 1: This is where it's at, people.

680
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,218
Speaker 0: Anything dramatic thriller, doctor, gun, running, science, fighting spy.

681
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,868
Speaker 1: Anything like that.

682
00:37:40,888 --> 00:37:41,620
Speaker 1: And it doesn't have too much spy.

683
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,299
Speaker 1: It has a little bit of spy at one point.

684
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:52,869
Speaker 1: But yeah, world hopping, crazy medical adventures of, you know, Jekyll and Hyde type stuff, Frankenstein type stuff.

685
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,222
Speaker 1: This is where it's at.

686
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,646
Speaker 1: This is like 1970.

687
00:37:56,646 --> 00:38:07,112
Speaker 1: And the scary thing is, you look at this, in 1970, someone was writing one of the most serious and revolutionary medical drama stories ever in a graphic novel.

688
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:14,179
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, in 1970, the comic books in the United States were the corniest, corny, cornball crap you ever saw.

689
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:15,760
Speaker 1: So this is worth reading.

690
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,440
Speaker 1: Because you'll fucking learn something.

691
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:26,748
Speaker 0: So just as an aside, before we close out this week of us being tired between one holiday and another holiday, Katsucon!

692
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:28,388
Speaker 0: In February.

693
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,480
Speaker 0: It's a ways off.

694
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,339
Speaker 0: We're not going to talk about it a lot yet.

695
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,940
Speaker 0: But it looks like we are going to be emceeing the video game room in some capacity.

696
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:53,051
Speaker 0: Meaning that if you come to Katsucon, we will be in the video game room making noise, running panels, doing game shows, having trash talk Mario Tennis tournaments, doing interviews, and generally making a ruckus for the whole con.

697
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:57,279
Speaker 1: We're going to be doing more at Katsucon than at any con we have done previously.

698
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:04,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we'll get you more details once we hammer them out with the con, but they asked us, you know, what can you do?

699
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:09,740
Speaker 0: And we sent back the list of like, well we can do this kind of event, we can do this kind of event, or we can do this kind of layout and this kind of thing.

700
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,979
Speaker 0: You know, the stuff we send to cons.

701
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,113
Speaker 0: And they got back to us and they basically said,

702
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:13,194
Speaker 0: "Yes.".

703
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,728
Speaker 0: So we still have to deal with all the logistics of getting down and we have to do all our stuff.

704
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:24,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing about Katsucon is the hotel that Katsucon is in is in Washington,

705
00:39:24,346 --> 00:39:24,711
Speaker 1: D.C.,

706
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:25,359
Speaker 1: which kind of sucks.

707
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:27,460
Speaker 1: And it's sold out, which kind of sucks.

708
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:31,312
Speaker 1: So if you want to go, you're going to have to stay in this overflow hotel.

709
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,747
Speaker 1: that's a mile away and it's not going to be the greatest thing in the world.

710
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:35,960
Speaker 0: But that won't be so bad.

711
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:42,199
Speaker 0: I mean, I kind of counted on our friends having a room because they usually get one every year, but they ended up only having two spots.

712
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,577
Speaker 0: And along with Scott Johnson, there are three of us.

713
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,692
Speaker 0: Thus, no go.

714
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:47,099
Speaker 1: Yep.

715
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,771
Speaker 0: But it won't be a big deal.

716
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:49,498
Speaker 0: We'll deal with it.

717
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,371
Speaker 0: Because there's no way we're missing in Katsucon.

718
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,640
Speaker 1: Not with the kind of stuff that they're going to let us pull there.

719
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,738
Speaker 0: I've gone for the last few years and this will be Scott's first Katsucon, but I think he'll really like it.

720
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:04,658
Speaker 0: Especially if we're in the video game room showing punk kids what it really means to be good at Mario Tennis.

721
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically a portion of Katsucon will be Heek Knight's Con and you can all come and enjoy it.

722
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, our plan is Not to mention the rest of Katsucon, which will probably be great.

723
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, Katsucon is really freaking awesome.

724
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,199
Speaker 0: It's one of my favorite cons.

725
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,138
Speaker 1: We should bring Katsu.

726
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,959
Speaker 0: I mean, honestly, of all time, Otakon Katsucon Anime Central are probably my three favorite cons ever.

727
00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:26,185
Speaker 1: Alright.

728
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,460
Speaker 0: So we'll get you more details as they come out, but You can always go to the Katsucon website.

729
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,231
Speaker 0: Yes, you can, and if you live anywhere in the southeastern United States Southeastern?

730
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:41,500
Speaker 0: You mean mid-eastern, where Maryland is.

731
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,824
Speaker 0: You know what?

732
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:43,080
Speaker 0: Anywhere east of the Mississippi.

733
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,826
Speaker 1: Katsucon 13 Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington D.C.

00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:28,011
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

744
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:30,439
Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

745
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,479
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

746
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,979
Speaker 1: You can send us feedback by email to geekknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

747
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:48,560

748
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,071

752
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,820
Speaker 1: Geek Knights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

753
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,398
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

754
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,113
Speaker 1: I don't know what I'm going to give away.

755
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:30,699
Speaker 1: We'll see.

756
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:32,279
Speaker 0: Oh, you're going to give something away?

757
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:32,985
Speaker 0: I don't know.

758
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,480
Speaker 0: On Things of the Day?

759
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,579
Speaker 1: They're going to get no job.

760
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:37,490
Speaker 1: They're going to go to school.

761
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,519
Speaker 1: They're going to get no job.

762
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,939
Speaker 0: Alright, we should probably explain what that was.

763
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:43,240
Speaker 1: Are we starting already?

764
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:45,293
Speaker 0: I went all Dave and Joel.

765
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,060
Speaker 0: I could cut this out.

766
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,545
Speaker 1: Start again.

767
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:47,460
Speaker 0: You want me to start again?

768
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,828
Speaker 1: You didn't even say "thing of the

769
00:42:48,848 --> 00:42:49,030
Speaker 1: day."

770
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:49,799
Speaker 1: I did.

771
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:51,052
Speaker 1: No you didn't.

772
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:51,698
Speaker 0: I said it.

773
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,497
Speaker 1: Play it again.
