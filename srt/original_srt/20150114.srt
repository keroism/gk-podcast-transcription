00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:37,269
Speaker 1: so sometimes you get into those YouTube ghettos where like you click on a video and you watch it and then all the Recommendations are the same thing like you've stumbled into a meme.

12
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,522
Speaker 0: you would recommend that to you just for being.

13
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:54,307
Speaker 1: you see you'd think that but it didn't.

14
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,150
Speaker 1: it's too old.

15
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:58,489
Speaker 0: Just search for some related things and you'll find it.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,670
Speaker 1: I found crackle sauce and all the blank sauces again, but I didn't find that thing.

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,778
Speaker 1: Okay, but so I clicked on a clip.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,468
Speaker 1: that was a clip from The Critic because I saw it and I thought Does that thing have?

19
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,018
Speaker 0: Mmm, how many episodes does that show critic?

20
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:16,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, the critic not many only like two seasons, right?

21
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, 94 95 and then I guess had some online stuff.

22
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:23,915
Speaker 1: So not that many episodes 23 total.

23
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can watch that really easily.

24
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I click on this clip.

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,570
Speaker 1: That was just a clip from The Critic and it was hilarious.

26
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,482
Speaker 1: And I remembered The Critic and I remembered watching it.

27
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:36,879
Speaker 1: and I did was the show that I just Literally forgotten about in the modern era.

28
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:37,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, that shit holds up.

29
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:38,786
Speaker 0: It's not forgotten about.

30
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:39,770
Speaker 0: other people remember it.

31
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,637
Speaker 1: I'm saying I had forgotten about it.

32
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:46,413
Speaker 1: Okay, so I so Emily comes in I'm like, hey Remember The Critic.

33
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,380
Speaker 1: and she was like, I never watched The Critic.

34
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:49,103
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,990
Speaker 0: So I never watched the whole thing.

36
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:51,632
Speaker 1: I did.

37
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:53,138
Speaker 1: I watched The Critic.

38
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:54,162
Speaker 0: I seen enough of it.

39
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:56,330
Speaker 1: I watched it as it aired on ABC.

40
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:57,877
Speaker 1: I was really into.

41
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,885
Speaker 1: I was really into like animation stuff in general.

42
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:03,334
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah Why not?

43
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:05,223
Speaker 1: it was on like primetime.

44
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:06,188
Speaker 0: I watched enough of it.

45
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,014
Speaker 0: I mean, I was doing other stuff.

46
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:12,533
Speaker 1: I mean, I watched the original pre Simpsons Simpsons Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,530
Speaker 1: So The Critic boy Emily never seen it.

48
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:24,490
Speaker 1: So I go look for an episode and you don't even need to pirate it Because every single episode is just on YouTube with a bunch of views and no one seems to care.

49
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,456
Speaker 1: I don't think they're legit.

50
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,464
Speaker 1: They're mostly uploaded by I called The Critic fan.

51
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:32,315
Speaker 0: I Mean there's a legal.

52
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,970
Speaker 0: there's a Gundam channel that has legal Gundams on YouTube.

53
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's always hard to say though because remember the whole crunchyroll thing.

54
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,924
Speaker 0: This one's definitely legal.

55
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,790
Speaker 0: It's like Bandai's channel.

56
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:51,650
Speaker 1: so we started watching The Critic and I because I hadn't watched it since I was a little kid I Noticed things nowadays that I didn't notice back then of course.

57
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,084
Speaker 1: So in my opinion now, this is kind of like a geek bite of The Critic.

58
00:02:56,124 --> 00:02:59,214
Speaker 1: having seen it again recently one It holds up real well.

59
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,519
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, really funny.

60
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:05,263
Speaker 0: I could have predicted that but - It's basically the precursor to Family Guy.

61
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,151
Speaker 0: Well, no I mean so.

62
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:13,870
Speaker 1: no so the in terms of the style of animated comedy that The Critic has the critic was way ahead of its time.

63
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:21,298
Speaker 1: No other animated show Did the kind of humor that it did, you know the Family Guy thing of wow That's just like the time I whatever.

64
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,430
Speaker 1: and then it cuts to like a complete non sequitur.

65
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,277
Speaker 1: The Critic did that regularly.

66
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,262
Speaker 0: The Simpsons did that regularly.

67
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,147
Speaker 1: The Simpsons didn't do it that regularly.

68
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,290
Speaker 0: They did it enough, right?

69
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,338
Speaker 1: So when what season did The Simpsons do that?

70
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:35,260
Speaker 1: The Simpsons was a.

71
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,670
Speaker 0: I can find you Simpsons clips of this?

72
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,758
Speaker 1: Yes, I could do.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,169
Speaker 1: what year were they from?

74
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,197
Speaker 0: I don't know.

75
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:48,278
Speaker 1: But yeah, cuz this Scott was 1994 I was in middle school.

76
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,463
Speaker 0: What happened is right?

77
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:59,965
Speaker 0: The Simpsons was basically the first mainstream widely broadcast adult TV animation in the US and it was so big.

78
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:03,959
Speaker 1: well multiple critics say that this was the Precursor to Family Guy on Wikipedia.

79
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,246
Speaker 1: So fuck you, whatever.

80
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:10,026
Speaker 0: so From The Simpsons right because it was so successful.

81
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:19,769
Speaker 0: many many You know people tried to make animation for adults on US television and it eventually over the 90s You know was the biggest time of this was a golden era.

82
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:24,126
Speaker 0: Yes, the golden era was then because remember this shit was on primetime.

83
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,596
Speaker 0: All right, and that well This is still on prime.

84
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:32,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, but back then a cartoon being primetime not Was originally on primetime.

85
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know.

86
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:40,190
Speaker 0: But now today it pretty much has gotten to the point where only Fox does it other than Adult Swim?

87
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:41,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's it, right?

88
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:50,375
Speaker 0: So Like none of the other networks even bother trying to compete in the animation realm for adults at night and all Saturday You know, I don't even try.

89
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:58,162
Speaker 1: here's a quote here of all the projects completed by XSNL players the critic was the most fully realized layers and heartwarming.

90
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:16,059
Speaker 1: it took its cues from Woody Allen movies Like Annie Holland Manhattan and offered up a style of random abstract humor that wouldn't be seen again on television until Family Guy So watching it Emily on you know, sort of Unpointedly without me saying anything said wow.

91
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,129
Speaker 1: This is like a good version of Family Guy.

92
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,606
Speaker 1: So that's why I was thinking about Family Guy.

93
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,675
Speaker 1: What's interesting though?

94
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:32,250
Speaker 1: Is that it makes a ridiculous number of pop culture references That I think would be lost on pretty much anyone who would watch this show again.

95
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it ends up working much like how?

96
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:41,710
Speaker 1: well because you know No, because I didn't even know a lot of the references because I don't know a lot of actors names now.

97
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,224
Speaker 1: So why would I have known them in the 90s?

98
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,389
Speaker 0: I know more 90s ones than yeah thousands ones, you know, like Arnold that's also 80s.

99
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:57,630
Speaker 1: But what I noticed is that the that stuff in the critic was a lot like that stuff in Bugs Bunny Cartoons in Merry Melodies.

100
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:16,990
Speaker 1: There are jokes there if you recognize the caricatures of famous people But if you don't the jokes hold up on their own anyway so it's fine and if you're smart you at least recognize that thing in the background is Obviously a caricature of someone famous from that era and you can infer something about them from the way they're handled.

101
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,859
Speaker 1: So the critic I don't know.

102
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,285
Speaker 1: I watched a bunch of it.

103
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:34,210
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch all of it again, and It's really interesting to see how many modern animated comedy shows Basically are taking a lot of cues from what was really pioneered at least in the u.s.

104
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,184
Speaker 1: With the critic which didn't like it didn't actually do that.

105
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:39,689
Speaker 1: Well didn't last that long.

106
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,719
Speaker 1: No, I also remember that John Lovitz existed.

107
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:43,703
Speaker 1: I kind of forgot about him.

108
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:44,887
Speaker 0: What is he doing?

109
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:45,850
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

110
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,493
Speaker 1: Is he alive?

111
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:47,117
Speaker 0: I don't know.

112
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:50,992
Speaker 1: All right, let's see born 1957 SNL.

113
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:55,899
Speaker 1: Wow his summary ends with Did SNL until 1990?

114
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,989
Speaker 1: and then it doesn't say anything else.

115
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:02,143
Speaker 0: Tire and go to the beach cuz good job, dude trying to find that out.

116
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,106
Speaker 1: There's a lot of it.

117
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,170
Speaker 1: Broadway.

118
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,758
Speaker 1: He does a podcast I guess.

119
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,962
Speaker 0: good job, dude.

120
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:09,524
Speaker 0: You deserve it.

121
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:10,466
Speaker 1: Yeah.

122
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:11,670
Speaker 1: He's a funny guy.

123
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:19,770
Speaker 1: but so while I was watching all those Critics something else came up in the recommendations.

124
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,381
Speaker 0: Duckman that's another 90s adult TV show.

125
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,610
Speaker 1: man is pretty fucking forgotten.

126
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:36,192
Speaker 1: So Duckman also almost holds up And I'm gonna talk about it separately because I'm gonna watch a bunch of it and then talk about Duckman.

127
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:43,638
Speaker 0: Duckman is somewhere in between the critic the tick and like our Lucas arts adventure games.

128
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:53,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there was an adventure game for duck man Oh was there which was supposed to be released in the US but the production company went bankrupt.

129
00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:03,766
Speaker 1: it Eventually somehow got released in Germany and South Korea And nowhere else and it is one of the rarest PC adventure games ever published.

130
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:04,609
Speaker 0: sure you can download it.

131
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:05,050
Speaker 0: No problem.

132
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,377
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna look into that.

133
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:14,330
Speaker 1: But what I can say is that watching duck man I had forgotten about duck man, and I watched it like religiously when I was a little kid.

134
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:26,116
Speaker 1: So I started like unlocking memories in my brain as I watched this episode Like just what the deal was with this show And the two-headed son.

135
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:30,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I also saw a lot of future family guy echoes.

136
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:31,470
Speaker 1: actually.

137
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:37,270
Speaker 1: So the older brother in family guy reminds me of the older brother and duck man.

138
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,183
Speaker 1: They'd even have the same kind of voice acting style the anyway, I'll talk about.

139
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,310
Speaker 0: if you look at old arts You see where new arts got their shit.

140
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:53,038
Speaker 0: But duck man, no one, you know, I was listening to this Beethoven and I was like, oh man I never seen.

141
00:08:53,098 --> 00:09:05,678
Speaker 1: I've heard that music before recently At the record store on the radio, but watching duck man with Emily would never seen it before Was a series of what the fuck?

142
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,564
Speaker 1: Why does that kid have two heads?

143
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:08,046
Speaker 1: What?

144
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,370
Speaker 1: where is this set?

145
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,433
Speaker 1: What is?

146
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:11,119
Speaker 1: who are these?

147
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,386
Speaker 0: Wow Wow Okay, didn't you start at the start of the beginning to understand a lot of just random fucking episode?

148
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:19,389
Speaker 0: yeah, that's not gonna work.

149
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,218
Speaker 0: That show doesn't work with the random episode.

150
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:28,544
Speaker 1: and then I remember the duck man was voiced by Jason Alexander Basically playing a fucked up version of George Costanza as a duck.

151
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,010
Speaker 0: Yes, that is correct.

152
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,552
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's.

153
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:34,175
Speaker 1: I've been watching a lot of animation lately, but not a lot of anime.

154
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:34,736
Speaker 0: All right.

155
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:41,170
Speaker 0: Well the big news lately is People are going nuts over the two-sentence rumor.

156
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:42,254
Speaker 0: Right.

157
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:42,816
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's.

158
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,341
Speaker 0: I don't think oh, it's legit.

159
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,070
Speaker 1: There is a I am DV page already.

160
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,321
Speaker 0: That means it's confirmed.

161
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:51,330
Speaker 1: I'm assuming this movie is already in theaters.

162
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:54,393
Speaker 0: Well the live-action Akira never happened Even though it could.

163
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:58,247
Speaker 1: live-action Ava never happened the four or five times there were rumors.

164
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:11,950
Speaker 0: live-action Cowboy bebop with Keanu Reeves never happened Thank the gods, but it appears that the live-action ghost in the shell for the 700th attempt is More likely to happen than any of those have ever been likely to happen.

165
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:20,180
Speaker 1: I still think the percent chance of this happening is between five and six, but there is a name of famous Action girl actor lady.

166
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:21,506
Speaker 0: Do you don't know who that is?

167
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:26,125
Speaker 1: Do you I mean, okay So we just talked about her before we started recording the show.

168
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,390
Speaker 1: She's I said her name.

169
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,790
Speaker 0: So the name is Scarlett Johansson because I can read it on IMDb and all I know about her Is that she is a famous actress?

170
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:41,810
Speaker 1: Suspect she was cast in this specifically because she plays Black Widow and she's a woman and that's it.

171
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:46,150
Speaker 0: So she is like Hollywood's current famous action actress person.

172
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:52,518
Speaker 0: So if you have an action part for a person who is not have a penis So this is the person that you hire.

173
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:56,616
Speaker 1: so should we talk about how we expect this will be bad or we should talk about All the meta reasons.

174
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:10,996
Speaker 0: Well Disney's doing it first of all right, so problem number one Despite the fact that the major is a robot the major is not white and Scarlett Johansson is Problem number one.

175
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,126
Speaker 1: wait, so so are you telling me that?

176
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:23,841
Speaker 1: The Pharaoh wasn't white Moses isn't white that You'll Brenner wasn't white not that you know about the remake right.

177
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:25,245
Speaker 0: you'll Brenner was not.

178
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:28,836
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about you'll Brenner I don't know any other day.

179
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:29,518
Speaker 0: Okay.

180
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,022
Speaker 1: You're gonna be real sad.

181
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:33,690
Speaker 0: They made another Ten Commandments that has white people in it.

182
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:34,650
Speaker 1: There's a movie.

183
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,359
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that separately the same.

184
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,004
Speaker 0: I mean not that you'll Brenner is Egyptian Not that Moses.

185
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:47,449
Speaker 0: I mean Chotland Heston is white and Moses was not.

186
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:54,389
Speaker 1: But you at least you guys got Exodus gods and kings.

187
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:59,342
Speaker 0: is This like the 300 of Ten Commandments, uh it seems to be.

188
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:00,024
Speaker 1: let's see so.

189
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:06,039
Speaker 1: Moses is played by Christian Bale All right, and yes, I leave it at that my Batman.

190
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,961
Speaker 0: Go all right look.

191
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:07,864
Speaker 1: Here's here's the cast.

192
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,889
Speaker 1: look white white white.

193
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,748
Speaker 0: Why not hire some Egyptian people?

194
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:21,669
Speaker 0: Any of them at least white Jews and I mean you could hire Israelis - wow I did not realize until just know.

195
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,042
Speaker 1: this was Directed by Ridley Scott.

196
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:34,440
Speaker 1: yeah Anyway So it is not Necessarily wrong to ignore race when casting.

197
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:39,458
Speaker 1: it just so happens that whenever they ignore race for casting It's always in favor of everybody being white.

198
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, why?

199
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:42,470
Speaker 0: well we know why at the major was black.

200
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:44,644
Speaker 0: We couldn't really say anything about that.

201
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:48,446
Speaker 0: Yeah But and it always happens to be right.

202
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,416
Speaker 0: It's like It's one.

203
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,136
Speaker 0: They've actually Hollywood seems to less often Whitewashed black people.

204
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:57,689
Speaker 0: not that it doesn't happen and it happens all the goddamn.

205
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:05,170
Speaker 0: yeah But it's like they whitewashed the Asian people slightly more that they do than the black people who are also whitewashed.

206
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,333
Speaker 1: So even we're.

207
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:24,860
Speaker 1: what I've noticed in general is that ignoring racism and all the other issues that are clustered around this whenever there's a movie like this that has like it is set in a country with a Specific culture and those sorts of things and they whitewash it usually it's a sign that is gonna be pretty shitty independent of any racism.

208
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:31,829
Speaker 0: yeah, well, okay, so Going based on the history of everything Hollywood has ever done ever and the fact that is Disney and etc.

209
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:31,989
Speaker 0: etc.

210
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:42,596
Speaker 0: Basically we can assume if the original Ghost in the Shell if we consider that to be the middle of the gray area flat gray Right eight eight eight eight eight eight eight

211
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,077
Speaker 1: right

212
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:50,380
Speaker 0: and we consider Ghost in the Shell 2 innocence to be black Zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.

213
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:52,230
Speaker 0: this is gonna be white.

214
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:59,320
Speaker 1: So the other thing is I've thought about this a lot.

215
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,394
Speaker 1: actually I have this idea that you know sanctuary the ma the Best manga.

216
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:06,867
Speaker 1: we recommend that you guys just can't ever read because it's been out of print forever.

217
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:08,111
Speaker 0: sure you can get it on the Internet.

218
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,781
Speaker 1: yeah, you can pirate it, but there's no legit way to get it printed.

219
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:13,270
Speaker 0: a spy kill rim and steal it from his house?

220
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:14,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

221
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:15,794
Speaker 1: part of the problem Why you can't get it?

222
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:19,170
Speaker 1: cuz we talked about in geek nights a long time about every copy we saw in the Northeast.

223
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:25,378
Speaker 1: I have two and a half complete sets of it just because and our listeners from the old days probably bought all the rest of them.

224
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:28,232
Speaker 1: but You could do.

225
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:30,139
Speaker 1: there are two ways to adapt that.

226
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,707
Speaker 1: that would not be racist way.

227
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:37,970
Speaker 1: number one Adapted in America set in Japan with Japanese actors.

228
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:39,559
Speaker 1: that'd be fine.

229
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:48,690
Speaker 1: or Do a complete read adaptation and take that core story and rewrite it and set it like in the 80s in Chicago.

230
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:54,470
Speaker 1: That would also be okay because you're changing the setting and make you know you're you're localizing it.

231
00:14:54,711 --> 00:15:06,556
Speaker 1: There's ways to do that, but if they may did the former option, and it was all white actors probably Probably at least unconsciously racist I have no confidence this is gonna come out.

232
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:12,762
Speaker 1: nor do I have any confidence that is going to be good and I really just want more Ghost in the Shell standalone complex.

233
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:13,344
Speaker 0: Well.

234
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:13,766
Speaker 0: We're gonna.

235
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:14,950
Speaker 0: There's more Ghost in the Shell arise.

236
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,896
Speaker 1: We haven't seen I know and I'm just gonna wait until we can watch more of it in the theater like we did the other Ones I think those.

237
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,495
Speaker 0: finally we're approaching the point where all those Evangelion movies are done.

238
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:24,479
Speaker 0: we can watch those once.

239
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,790
Speaker 1: five dot five five five five five five five five or whatever comes out.

240
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,859
Speaker 1: We're just gonna marathon them all.

241
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:36,482
Speaker 0: the Evangelion Manga, I think is also done and oh shit son Viz has printed three in one volume.

242
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,430
Speaker 1: Did you ever read any of it?

243
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,115
Speaker 0: I read the start you can get.

244
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,932
Speaker 0: I think you can get all of it now in these three and one volumes from viz Cuz.

245
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,109
Speaker 1: that manga is really good.

246
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,887
Speaker 0: So and I think it's actually complete complete like you know what it's like.

247
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,055
Speaker 0: it is finished And there's not gonna be any.

248
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:54,090
Speaker 1: you know it's kind of like you keep talking about the Gundam manga.

249
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:57,892
Speaker 1: That's just like yeah, you wanted Exactly.

250
00:15:58,254 --> 00:15:59,522
Speaker 0: oh by the way Gundam the origin.

251
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,845
Speaker 1: if you're not reading that Seriously yeah, I gotta read it.

252
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:04,851

00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,349
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of competition in that?

257
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,590
Speaker 0: It's definitely in fact you know of all the comic cons in the US that are still comic cons.

258
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,313
Speaker 0: It's up there.

261
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,652
Speaker 0: no we're talking about the mainstream comic cons Not the.

262
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,482
Speaker 0: yeah tea caps and whatnots.

263
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,568
Speaker 1: I mean you don't want to go to.

264
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,570
Speaker 1: What was that stupid convention?

265
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:51,176
Speaker 0: We went to and cuz I mean New York comic-con San Diego comic-con c2e2 all these Comic-cons that you know well.

266
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:52,700
Speaker 0: come no longer about comedy.

267
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:59,670
Speaker 1: use the new definition of comic-con which means generic pop culture Convention that you walk in and walk all the comic cons that are still comic cons.

268
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:05,626
Speaker 0: ECCC is like one of the top Three in the North America easily yep in fact.

269
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:12,137
Speaker 1: It's a comic-con I would go to if it weren't in Seattle and if I didn't already fly to Seattle once or twice a year for other conventions.

270
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:17,580
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like if ECCC were the weekend before or after packs I'd probably stick around and go to it.

271
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

272
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,128
Speaker 0: yeah, it's worth it.

273
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,627
Speaker 0: It's what kind of thing it's definitely worth it to go to for a day.

274
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:44,248
Speaker 1: well read pop known for Running the awful New York comic-con for running the okay, New York anime festival and then destroying it For somehow running the all the penny arcade expos and not destroying them Is now taking also the c2e2 also Star Wars yeah celebration celebration.

275
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:49,469
Speaker 1: from what I hear They do a good job with that one, but Star Wars celebration is basically a big expo kind of con.

276
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:49,750
Speaker 1: anyway.

277
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:51,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm good at that kind of con.

278
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:55,210
Speaker 1: Their bait read pop is basically good at running a certain kind of convention.

279
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,109
Speaker 0: It's just having to do like book expo.

280
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:57,953
Speaker 1: They do a lot of.

281
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:58,596
Speaker 0: they do a lot of.

282
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,243
Speaker 0: they do some wrestling con or something.

283
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:05,970
Speaker 1: just so happens that the kinds of Conventions they're good at running are the convention formats that I hate more than anything.

284
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:10,640
Speaker 1: so Read pop is taking over the Emerald City comic-con.

285
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,130
Speaker 0: They just bought it so the people who owned it sold it to them.

286
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,560
Speaker 1: Let's see here's the comics.

287
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,003
Speaker 0: was it?

288
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:16,030
Speaker 0: was it not for profit?

289
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:20,166
Speaker 1: Research this because it happened very recently like Dateline today.

290
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,210
Speaker 1: I was looking at this.

291
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:23,627
Speaker 1: Let's see read pop blah blah blah blah blah.

292
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:35,865
Speaker 1: Emerald City comic-con is now a part of read pop comics Alliance has confirmed that as part of the acquisition of ECCC The director John de Manacos and his staff will remain not just blah blah blah.

293
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,369
Speaker 0: who's gonna actually run the show?

294
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,195
Speaker 1: So that's the question.

295
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,401
Speaker 0: which individual human being?

296
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,770
Speaker 0: so I think Lance Fensterman runs in New York comic-con.

297
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,522
Speaker 0: I hope it's someone at read pop at least that's the last name that I heard.

298
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:56,385
Speaker 1: there are people at read pop that we know Who you can trust to be awesome, and there are people you can trust to fuck things up.

299
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,974
Speaker 1: not gonna name names I don't know which.

300
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:02,429
Speaker 1: who's dealing with this one, so we'll see.

301
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:10,649
Speaker 1: I hope this opinion I'm about to lay down doesn't anger anyone who's listening because we you know are go to PAX is all the time.

302
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:31,707
Speaker 1: in my Personal opinion the only reason read hasn't ruined the penny arcade expos is because PA Corp and the PA people and the Enforcers that were like there from the early days Actually make all the important decisions that matter and read does most of the logistics and all the other stuff.

303
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,080
Speaker 1: I Don't think that's the case with all these other cons.

304
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,656
Speaker 1: I don't think ECCC is gonna remain a good convention Mmm.

305
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,170
Speaker 1: That is my personal opinion.

306
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:44,209
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe that was yeah.

307
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:53,377
Speaker 1: I mean I hope I'm wrong and I hope that packs continues to remain awesome to throw everything but We'll see what happens with ECC.

308
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,984
Speaker 1: see see see see.

309
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:59,199
Speaker 0: I mean it is a big You know convention hall convention it is.

310
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,326
Speaker 0: it just happens to be a well done one.

311
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:13,561
Speaker 1: Just like Heroes con is yep So will they shift it more toward being pop culture New York comic-con SDCC style because it does have a large Percentage is comics because I don't mind generic con.

312
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:16,590
Speaker 1: what I hate is comic-con style generic.

313
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,010
Speaker 1: Can I like at least have like Dragon Con or kinetic on style generic con?

314
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,549
Speaker 1: Not to be confused with generic.

315
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:33,740
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

316
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:39,434
Speaker 1: I don't know if we ever talked about this on geek nights But Nina Paley has done a few awesome things on the internet.

317
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nina Paley's is awesome person.

318
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:48,420
Speaker 0: she makes animations and other arts and You might remember from back in the day because she was like big into the Creative Commons action.

319
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,610
Speaker 0: There's a video you almost probably have seen where it's like.

320
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:57,400
Speaker 0: it looks like an old Mickey Mouse cartoon in black and white and they're Singing a song like copying is not theft.

321
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

322
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:04,098
Speaker 0: So she did that and then since then she's done a lot of other things and kick-started a movie.

323
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,630
Speaker 0: and you know She just keeps putting stuff out and she keeps being awesome.

324
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:11,980
Speaker 1: Yep, like she did see two things the blues Movie she kick-started and she's got another thing in the works.

325
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:20,124
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is two of her videos because one they're kind of relevant to modern politics and two Perennially relevant.

326
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:28,334
Speaker 1: Yes perennial is in fact the perfect word to use there But two they both involve something amazing.

327
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:31,819
Speaker 1: So the kind of thing that I'm really into personified death.

328
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:39,273
Speaker 1: her personification of death is Possibly the best personification of death the world has ever seen.

329
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:41,480
Speaker 0: should it have a fight with birthday abacus death?

330
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:43,740
Speaker 1: Oh, they're pretty good deaths, but look at that death.

331
00:21:44,022 --> 00:21:45,050
Speaker 0: She should have a fight.

332
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,360
Speaker 1: look at that death face right there.

333
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,769
Speaker 0: You have a fight with Adventure Time death.

334
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:53,915
Speaker 0: Adventure Time death is pretty good, too Like because Adventure Time death what I like about him is doesn't have a human skull.

335
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,814
Speaker 1: true true I got that rat skull thing going on.

336
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:59,226
Speaker 1: Yeah So you got a thing of the day?

337
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:03,309
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so her video video number one This land is mine.

338
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,702
Speaker 1: It is a history of the conflict in Israel and Palestine from caveman days through today Mm-hmm.

339
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:26,210
Speaker 1: And actually the cool thing about the video is if you go to her page She actually has a really long list of every single culture that's shown in the video and what their deal was Mm-hmm and to the death of the firstborn Egyptians.

340
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:29,400
Speaker 1: the witch will get stuck in your head and make you really depressed.

341
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:32,186
Speaker 0: Good thing it never actually happened.

342
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:32,547
Speaker 1: Yep.

343
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,250
Speaker 1: No, no, not.

344
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,509
Speaker 1: not the fact that Egyptians died in a mythical Christian past Because it's a mythical Jewish past.

345
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a mythical past of a lot of people.

346
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:47,838
Speaker 1: Anyway, these are both really good Nita Paley's amazing, right?

347
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,533
Speaker 0: So rim you ever had to change a flat tire on your bike.

348
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:59,653
Speaker 1: I actually have never Since I switched away from mountain bikes changed a flat tire on my bike.

349
00:22:59,794 --> 00:22:59,994
Speaker 0: Hmm.

350
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:01,117
Speaker 0: We've had a flat tire.

351
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,747
Speaker 1: Uh No, no, not on my new bikes.

352
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:06,674
Speaker 1: I have not actually had a flat tire.

353
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,079
Speaker 0: Well, I got close.

354
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,037
Speaker 0: Well changing a flat tire sucks is doable, but it sucks and it's kind of hard.

355
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:14,680
Speaker 0: You got eat first.

356
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,363
Speaker 1: Well, it's gone.

357
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,072
Speaker 1: I want to tell you if it's a mountain bike.

358
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:18,036
Speaker 1: It doesn't suck.

359
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:18,780
Speaker 1: It takes two seconds.

360
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,082
Speaker 1: You can do.

361
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,540
Speaker 0: it is way easier with a mountain bike with big fat tires.

362
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:25,673
Speaker 0: So here's the process of changing a tire on a bicycle.

363
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,078
Speaker 0: first you got to pop the wheel off.

364
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:27,760
Speaker 0: that's way easy.

365
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,226
Speaker 0: Yep, then you got a little.

366
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,069
Speaker 1: this is the back tire.

367
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,274
Speaker 1: You gotta like get the chain.

368
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:32,157
Speaker 0: That's fine.

369
00:23:32,198 --> 00:23:32,780
Speaker 0: It's still easy.

370
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,485
Speaker 1: It adds another like 30 seconds, whatever.

371
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,998
Speaker 0: then you got to get the tire off the bike and you need specialized off the rim.

372
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:42,520
Speaker 0: So Mainly you just remove some air because it's flat.

373
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:52,097
Speaker 0: Anyway, it should have some air removed right and you use tire levers Which like you basically stick it in between the rim and the tire and sort of pop out the thing.

374
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,559
Speaker 0: and then you go whoosh In a circle and basically now the tire is only half on the rim.

375
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,191
Speaker 0: Then you grab the the tube that's broken and pull it out.

376
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:08,459
Speaker 0: Then you sort of partially inflate a new tube Stick it in, you know inside the tire nice, you know, make sure it doesn't like get crimped or anything.

377
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:13,339
Speaker 0: Then you got a wedge that tire back onto the rim, which is the hardest part.

378
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:21,860
Speaker 0: Then you got to reinflate it and make sure it's all 100% perfect and sealed and beautiful and everything Yep, and then you got to put the tire back on the bike.

379
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,732
Speaker 0: So this is even with tire even with the appropriate tools and everything.

380
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:30,987
Speaker 0: This is not a trivial thing to do With two hands as a human being.

381
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:36,405
Speaker 0: also then you have to reinflate it, which is really hard considering the fact that well It's super de-inflated.

382
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:39,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, well like in the old days, it's not like pumping it up like oh, I lost a little bit air.

383
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,628
Speaker 0: It's like oh it's empty.

384
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,134
Speaker 1: for most of my life.

385
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:49,700
Speaker 1: I lived in a house I could have the tools and equipment necessary to do bike maintenance.

386
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:56,500
Speaker 1: Now that I live in New York City I pay other people to do all my bike maintenance because it's such a pain in the ass if you don't have all that equipment.

387
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:59,512
Speaker 0: So in this video you will see a person.

388
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:01,019
Speaker 1: Oh, I just saw what this video is.

389
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:07,240
Speaker 0: You'll see a person who is among the class of people known as ultimate badasses.

390
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:16,826
Speaker 0: He has no arms, well, I guess he has some arm below the elbow Left but he doesn't have any hands.

391
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:17,348
Speaker 0: Whoa.

392
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:21,280
Speaker 0: Look at that bicep Jesus and he doesn't have a right arm at all.

393
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:23,360
Speaker 0: But you don't need arms to ride a bicycle.

394
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,729
Speaker 1: But you might all right this guy's doing.

395
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,114
Speaker 1: he's doing it faster than I could do it.

396
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:28,038
Speaker 0: Let's in fast-forward.

397
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:32,027
Speaker 1: No, no This video is four minutes long.

398
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:34,838
Speaker 1: I could not do it in four minutes even in fast-forward.

399
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:43,021
Speaker 0: four minutes Right, but yeah, he changes a bike tire with basically one arm mostly using feet teeth He'd.

400
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:48,299
Speaker 0: the only advantage he has is that he doesn't have to pump because he has a can of a little compressed air cylinder thingy.

401
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,250
Speaker 1: That's what I would always carry with me.

402
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should get one of those.

403
00:25:52,582 --> 00:26:00,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, his tire lever is better than my tire lever because it attaches to the like, you know spoke in the middle of the Tire.

404
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,733
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what tire levers you bought.

405
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:06,210
Speaker 0: you bought the cheapest one on Amazon Yeah, the blue plastic one.

406
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:07,698
Speaker 0: three of them the one that everyone has.

407
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:12,680
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, he's got the one that like attaches to the middle of the tire and goes whoosh in a circle real easily.

408
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:14,514
Speaker 0: That's the only advantage he's got.

409
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:17,366
Speaker 0: otherwise Super disadvantage.

410
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:23,040
Speaker 0: not having any goddamn arms Changes the tire way easier than I can do it.

411
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:29,871
Speaker 0: This is an amazing video and he needs to do this because basically he's like taking long ass bike trips You know all by himself.

412
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,340
Speaker 0: He's got to be able to change the tire.

413
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:40,639
Speaker 1: That is why I was into mountain biking where like if I had a problem fuck and I just like walk out or whatever Or I could just fix it trivially, but I didn't carry a lot of equipment with me.

414
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:51,180
Speaker 1: I don't do super long bike treks Unless it's some sort of organized event where there's like following maintenance cars and things just because I don't have patience for this stuff anymore.

415
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,726
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Wow, this video is really amazing.

416
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:55,027
Speaker 0: Yes.

417
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,798
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's good bike - well, I mean, it's got to go really far.

418
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:06,942
Speaker 1: Yeah So In the meta moment the book love book is still a water ship down the amazing story of a bunch of rabbits on an epic Adventure.

419
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:07,885
Speaker 1: and it's a really good book.

Speaker 0: you're the rather would hope so with the title.

427
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:23,673
Speaker 0: Not know that there would be water ships and something going down.

428
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:25,820
Speaker 1: Well, read you read your book.

429
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:45,792

Speaker 1: I didn't ask Scott before the show.

439
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:23,755

440
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:24,459
Speaker 0: Why?

441
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:32,140
Speaker 1: because our Listeners who are the listener who's excited about the show already is invested.

442
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,103
Speaker 1: He's gonna listen whatever.

443
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:38,100
Speaker 1: but whenever someone who isn't a your existing fan links to us for whatever reason they're like.

444
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,379
Speaker 1: Oh, they just reviewed that anime that I like and then it's 20 minutes of us bullshitting about biking and living in New York.

445
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:51,161
Speaker 0: But and also so that so they want to really listen to that review of that anime they like and now we're introducing them to Us.

446
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:59,452
Speaker 0: if they might just turn off after that review true and then not get to know us true But I thought of a very specific UX case on this.

447
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:02,524
Speaker 1: so say I'm the listener I just make two mp3s.

448
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:04,471
Speaker 1: then I yeah, I thought about that.

449
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:05,093
Speaker 0: we could do.

450
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:08,827
Speaker 0: we could do like news episode Main vid episode.

451
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:12,259
Speaker 1: I had thought about doing that and having separate RSS feeds for a long time.

452
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:15,558
Speaker 0: Maybe we should when we make two different geek night two different shows.

453
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,706
Speaker 0: geek nights Bullshit nice pure and geek.

471
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,978
Speaker 1: Kickstarter is just pre-order for badges.

472

473
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:16,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could good Yeah, or I could kick-start it just because I found some venues.

Speaker 1: We'll see.

475
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:19,568
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's about it.

476
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:25,134
Speaker 1: I don't have any other meta, so We saw a movie movie that most of you can't see.

477
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:26,019
Speaker 0: what song to see?

478
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:30,927
Speaker 0: Okay So I make fun of Irish people.

479
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:36,478
Speaker 1: the one the one one of the many manifold benefits of living in New York City Is that we see pretty much?

480
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:48,980
Speaker 1: Every anime or animated feature that's available to be seen in a theater that we want to see That we're home that we're home to see exactly Like I missed Princess Kaguya cuz I was out of town for something.

481
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,031
Speaker 0: I think that'll be easy to see if you want to.

482
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:54,909
Speaker 1: yeah, it will be probably but I Remember where I was.

483
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:55,956
Speaker 0: I don't know where you were.

484
00:30:56,117 --> 00:30:58,023
Speaker 0: so anyway Long ago.

485
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:02,800
Speaker 1: you may remember the secret of cals which was a really beautiful movie that we really really enjoyed.

486
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,872
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we reviewed it.

487
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:09,619
Speaker 1: Yep Tom Moore went on to now do Song of the sea which is about silkies.

488
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:15,118
Speaker 0: So if you don't know there is basically the secret of cals made by these people who were in Ireland.

489
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,632
Speaker 0: They're Irish All right, and it's sort of unusual to think of animation from Ireland.

490
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:39,657
Speaker 0: usually only think of animation from the United States Canada Japan sometimes France Sometimes Korea, and there aren't really a lot of other countries that are known for their Animated creations, I guess there's some old Russian animations that are interesting, but it's not like.

491
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,845
Speaker 0: oh man Have you seen that new?

492
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,974
Speaker 0: you know Belgian animation?

493
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:45,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, have you seen that new?

494
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,647
Speaker 0: Czechoslovakian animation movie.

495
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,419
Speaker 0: wow yeah, they don't really have big animation studios.

496
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:56,059
Speaker 1: You know in all these countries or in the times that they do they're very domestic or locally.

497
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,108
Speaker 0: yeah They're not making full-length.

498
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:02,164
Speaker 0: You know top production quality Motion pictures.

499
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,351
Speaker 0: right they may be making like a local.

500
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:11,119
Speaker 0: You know like Poland only TV show or Argentina only you know movie or whatever right?

501
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,782
Speaker 0: It's pretty rare.

502
00:32:12,882 --> 00:32:15,933
Speaker 0: so in Ireland made secret of cals that was a big fucking deal.

503
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:20,207
Speaker 0: cuz like whoa Ireland made a 90 ish full-length.

504
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:23,377
Speaker 0: you know 90 ish minute full-length motion animated feature.

505
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:24,240
Speaker 0: that is top quality.

506
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:25,840
Speaker 1: Holy shit, I mean it was beautiful.

507
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:32,140
Speaker 1: It was drawn from like the aesthetic of old illuminations from like Christian manuscripts in the monasteries.

508
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:37,224
Speaker 1: It was nominated for best animated feature that year 2008 2009.

509
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,618
Speaker 0: So when they made secret of cals they didn't have mad moneys.

510
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:52,160
Speaker 1: I read that there were production issues, so I'm sure there was really good And I really liked it, but it had some pacing issues, and it's sort of meandered in the second half.

511
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:58,980
Speaker 1: But apparently part of that came out of them not necessarily having had enough money to finish it and a troubled production process.

512
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:01,191
Speaker 1: So now you know armed with.

513
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,204
Speaker 0: but because it because it was so good They got money.

514
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:07,032
Speaker 1: armed with money in the faith of other people and everything involved.

515
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:09,380
Speaker 1: Tom Moore went on to now direct song of the sea.

516
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,766
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna see.

517
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:13,820
Speaker 1: we're not gonna spoil anything obviously other than it's about selkies.

518
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:18,149
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't say the old myths of Basically where seals?

519
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,840
Speaker 0: yeah, it's Irish people.

520
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,393
Speaker 1: You know in Ireland Dungeons & Dragons players know who selkies are.

521
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:35,375
Speaker 0: it's cold in Ireland and it's north And it's surrounded by water because an island and seals live there, so there's a lot of folk tales about People that turn into seals and back and those are called selkies.

522
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:43,067
Speaker 1: yep, so This review aside what I can say and I think Scott agrees this I think this was the best movie I saw in 2014.

523
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:43,509
Speaker 0: problem.

524
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:43,811
Speaker 0: Well.

525
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:44,775
Speaker 0: I think it's the best.

526
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:49,353
Speaker 0: It's definitely the best movie I saw in 2014 that I hadn't seen before and came out in 2014.

527
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:56,023
Speaker 1: even of the movies I saw in 2014 that came out before 2014 I think it was the best movie I saw in 2014.

528
00:33:56,023 --> 00:34:00,780
Speaker 0: think I saw a rear window at least once in 2014 for like the seventh or eighth time.

529
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:03,103
Speaker 0: I can't say that.

530
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:03,866
Speaker 0: yeah, I did not.

531
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:09,000
Speaker 0: I had to put more stipulations, but did I also rewatch seven samurai?

532
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:11,425
Speaker 0: It is possible.

533
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:21,599
Speaker 1: it far surpasses the Secret of Kells in terms of Production in terms of story and everything and the Secret of Kells was already super good.

534
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:25,219
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah This is like saying yeah, this is way beyond Ava.

535
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:29,840
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it's like they went from really good - yeah now you got it right.

536
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,434
Speaker 0: It's sort of like wow that person's really fat.

537
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:33,679
Speaker 0: You know it's like they went in the Olympics.

538
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,725
Speaker 0: They came out of nowhere.

539
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,969
Speaker 0: They got like the silver medal.

540
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:40,130
Speaker 0: It's like whoa good job guys We never even heard of you before and you had the silver medal.

541
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:40,936
Speaker 0: That's crazy good.

542
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:42,771
Speaker 1: and the next year They're like yeah, we need a plan.

543
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:46,170
Speaker 0: the next year It's like they're across the finish line and no one else even started yet.

544
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,598
Speaker 0: It's like oh, okay.

545
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:50,329
Speaker 0: Good job You got it now.

546
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,155
Speaker 1: What's cool.

547
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:51,880
Speaker 1: Is that once again?

548
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:58,800
Speaker 1: It has a very much like Kells had this very sort of Two-dimensional flat aesthetic kind of based on the art that it was based.

549
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,693
Speaker 0: You can tell just by looking at it that it was made by the same people exactly.

550
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:04,620
Speaker 0: even if it wasn't about something Irish.

551
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:10,480
Speaker 1: It has a consistent and beautiful color palette and aesthetic that fits the story.

552
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,260
Speaker 1: It's telling so well.

553
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:24,676
Speaker 0: Yeah They pretty much took all the green Markers that they ran out of when they use secretive cows and they started using the blue markers because they had extra And also more importantly secretive cows told us.

554
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:27,225
Speaker 1: sort of Meandering and melancholy.

555
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:32,862
Speaker 1: story was almost I don't want to say it was slice of life because it did have like a hero's journey and all Aspects.

556
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:39,480
Speaker 1: but in a way it was just this look at an era and a setting and a place and a mindset.

557
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:51,220
Speaker 1: Song of the sea is not that it is a very very strong narrative that Simultaneously is a very strong like internally consistent allegory.

558
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,272
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean It's pretty much this like direct adventure tale like just like most kids movies.

559
00:35:57,373 --> 00:36:00,320
Speaker 0: are you know plot structure wise and if you're an adult?

560
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:19,206
Speaker 1: You know everything that's going to happen in this movie After the first five minutes, however, if you're an adult who's mostly used to Disney or American animated features You will find the end and the sort of message and moral of the story to be Deeply painfully melancholy.

561
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:20,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like it.

562
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,140
Speaker 0: mean I consider it to be a happy ending, but it's not a happy.

563
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:26,287
Speaker 0: Aladdin marries jasmine ending.

564
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:30,019
Speaker 1: no, it is a happy in that was resolved to the best that it could be.

565
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,679
Speaker 1: The world is moving on to another stage in era.

566
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:40,696
Speaker 0: These problems that could be solved have been solved, but they have been solved in a way.

567
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:40,776
Speaker 1: Yes.

568
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:44,639
Speaker 0: Yes I mean, what other kind of solution did you want?

569
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,509
Speaker 1: We'll talk a little bit about some of the.

570
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:49,480
Speaker 1: what actually if you already saw the movie?

571
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,767
Speaker 0: All right, so it's a quick plot summary, right?

572
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:54,074
Speaker 0: So there's a family happy Irish family.

573
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:55,719
Speaker 1: Well, not a happy family.

574
00:36:56,624 --> 00:36:57,571
Speaker 0: They're happy at the beginning.

575
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:04,175
Speaker 0: Okay, okay They live on an island with a lighthouse with a lighthouse, which is pretty awesome, right?

576
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,358

Speaker 1: So she now they have a boy who's just a normal boy.

584
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a son who's young and mom's pregnant with I guess a seal.

585
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:31,824
Speaker 1: Yes On the night that the young girl the sister is to be born the mother Essentially dies.

586
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:36,940
Speaker 0: she goes into the ocean because she's a seal and now the movie and all they have left is the daughter.

587
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:47,815
Speaker 1: So he actually begins effectively with a young boy who resents his younger sister for effectively killing his mom Which is actually a common tale both in literature and in real life.

588
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:51,798
Speaker 0: That is something that happens alright, so mom's gone she turned into a seal or died or whatever.

589
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:55,936
Speaker 0: and The sisters their brother doesn't like the sister there.

590
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:56,719
Speaker 0: He's way older.

591
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,048
Speaker 0: now This is like five.

592
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:02,209
Speaker 1: at least five years after this opening He resents her for the mother's death effectively.

593
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:02,791
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

594
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:07,307
Speaker 1: And meanwhile the father's life is in shambles Again, because of the mother's death.

595
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:11,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, my wife turned into a seal and or and died and or disappeared.

596
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:12,604
Speaker 0: I'm upset.

597
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:16,920
Speaker 0: Yep, and then from mom was awesome because she was a selkie.

598
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:19,849
Speaker 0: It's like it's not just your wife.

599
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,779
Speaker 0: It's like you're a ridiculously awesome wife.

600
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,244
Speaker 1: This is both this.

601
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:30,136
Speaker 1: this is a tale of all of the major characters every single one of them Coming to terms with something.

602
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:31,082
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It's it's.

603
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:39,250
Speaker 1: it's a very rarely if I seen a movie that has such complete character arcs for every Character who has more than trivial speaking lines.

604
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,338
Speaker 1: Yep, who does not have a complete character arc?

605
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,060
Speaker 1: the dog?

606
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,651
Speaker 0: The bus drive the fairy dude.

607
00:38:45,752 --> 00:38:49,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess there's Before the movie.

608
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:53,760
Speaker 1: wait, the fairy dudes do have a complete arc because you get their arc through the past.

609
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,295
Speaker 1: I thought you're talking about the guy who drives the ferry not the fairies.

610
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:58,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah fairy dude.

611
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,788
Speaker 0: Yeah fairy dude also, but also a hairdude.

612
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,573
Speaker 1: Yeah hairdo dude.

613
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,700
Speaker 1: I like hairdo hair dudes on the cover here.

614
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean he looks really cool.

615
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:13,731
Speaker 1: So yeah, but seriously if you even if you hate animation and hate movies You should coach there is literally no one.

616
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,180
Speaker 1: this movie is not for right.

617
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:24,037
Speaker 0: So basically after you know it fast forwards in time There's an adventure of traveling across land and encountering things and learning and advancing.

618
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:30,735
Speaker 1: and then the story Follows these characters and also follows basically the sweep of Irish myth.

619
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,765
Speaker 0: Yep, very people selkie beginning to end.

620
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:39,044
Speaker 0: also commentary and modern things Mm-hmm whatnot.

621
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:41,671
Speaker 1: So if I can't I cannot stress this enough.

622
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,917
Speaker 0: also beautiful animations and music.

623
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:45,060
Speaker 1: the soundtrack is great.

624
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:48,414
Speaker 1: The voice acting is super great.

625
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:49,438
Speaker 0: The characters have voices.

626
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:54,971
Speaker 1: Yeah You mean all but one the dog.

627
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,477
Speaker 1: he talks wolf.

628
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:59,606
Speaker 1: yeah I point out that owls.

629
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:01,012
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

630
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:01,935
Speaker 1: I like the owls a lot too.

631
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:05,945
Speaker 1: I like their little jars About the other seals.

632
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:10,640
Speaker 0: the seals obviously kind of seals are definitely the best and I like how the seals look like.

633
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,047
Speaker 1: They're smiling by the way, they're drawn.

634
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:13,194
Speaker 1: I think that's a real.

635
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:16,875
Speaker 1: seals are like that - yes But the way they're drawn and the way they're presented double cute.

636
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:17,458
Speaker 1: They're bobbing.

637
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,529
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I think triple cute.

638
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:24,709
Speaker 1: then is the young girl the selkie When she turns into a seal.

639
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,013
Speaker 1: spoilers, I guess.

640
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:34,600
Speaker 0: Oh my god Selkie's daughter is also a selkie, but you don't say then when she's a seal when she's wearing her up her selkie cape.

641
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:35,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty good.

642
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:40,800
Speaker 1: So go see the movie and you might as well stop listening right now.

643
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:47,909
Speaker 0: It might not be the easiest thing for you to see right now because it's like in theaters and weird places And there's a calendar.

644
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:54,200
Speaker 0: if you go search on Google You can see the calendar or linked rim could link to it and you'll see where it's playing in various countries and cities.

645
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:59,220
Speaker 0: But secret of Kells was on Netflix like very soon after we saw it.

646
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:03,532
Speaker 0: So I'm sure this will be on Netflix DVD everything etc.

647
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:08,266
Speaker 0: in relatively short order like months If not weeks exactly.

648
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,553
Speaker 1: so see it as soon as you can.

649
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:16,700
Speaker 1: and now I actually kind of want to talk about What actually happens in the movie for the few people who might have seen it or if they come back later?

650
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,520
Speaker 0: But okay.

651
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:21,431
Speaker 1: So spoilers past this point stop listening unless you saw the movie.

652
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:27,190
Speaker 0: and I would actually keep listening because it won't ruin the movie Because the movie is a hundred percent obvious to anyone intelligent.

653
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,920
Speaker 1: However, it will change your perception of the movie?

654
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:30,602
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

655
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,228
Speaker 1: I think it will anyway.

656
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:33,874
Speaker 1: spoilers spoilers spoilers.

657
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:36,583
Speaker 0: It doesn't even have surprises Spoilers.

658
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:42,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can go find the forum thread where everyone in the world argues with Scott about whether or not spoilers matter.

659
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:53,105
Speaker 1: They don't anyway, so I Really liked the fact that pretty much every one of you like the kid Does his adventure.

660
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:57,680
Speaker 1: but look at the back framing story the story of you know, the fairy?

661
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:06,723
Speaker 1: King, well the the giant guy who has turned to stone to take away his suffering and how he is obviously The young boy's father.

662
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:15,609
Speaker 1: Yep, and how the villain the baba yaga and her baba yaga hut equivalent the owl lady is Straight up the grandma and the movie even like

663
00:42:15,709 --> 00:42:24,640
Speaker 0: lonely, you know when we went to see it Tom Moore was there and he said Basically, like that wasn't originally gonna be the grandma but then they changed it to make it that way.

664
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:35,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like I think by making every single like conflict along the adventure path Into something that lined up with you know, their real lives and real problems.

665
00:42:36,082 --> 00:42:46,800
Speaker 0: That was really interesting cuz like sometimes, you know, it's kind of similar to a spirited away Right in that you sort of encounter these different, you know monsters or even Alice in Wonderland, right?

666
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:55,500
Speaker 0: She's encountering these different things along the way Yeah, and they have sort of a metaphor for you know real problems and other things right on this adventure.

667
00:42:55,641 --> 00:43:00,620
Speaker 0: But this one is like so direct without being overwrought at the giant.

668
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:08,791
Speaker 1: The giant was turned to stone by his mother to harden his heart So he would not suffer anymore mourning the loss of his dead lover.

669
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,876
Speaker 0: and that is a hundred percent what grandma is doing.

670
00:43:11,137 --> 00:43:19,426
Speaker 1: grandma is Basically hardening the heart of the father whose life has become static because he can't get over the loss of his wife Mm-hmm, and he's holding basically the.

671
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:23,340
Speaker 1: the young boy is sort of stuck in the middle of all this and goes on his journey.

672
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:36,883
Speaker 1: but all of that because there's no way in the real world when Mom dies giving birth to younger daughter for that situation to be resolved Happily.

673
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,795
Speaker 1: or fairy tale like you can't just bring someone back.

674
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:54,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Recognizing that watching the movie and then realizing that the entire fairy adventure is a parallel to that The beginning of the movie tells you that this does not end with all those fairies turned to stone Being brought back to life.

675
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:56,551
Speaker 1: it ends with them all moving on.

676
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:59,479
Speaker 1: it ends with the end of the fairies.

677
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:01,028
Speaker 1: Yeah end of an era the.

678
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,578
Speaker 1: I said in the beginning we were reviewing.

679
00:44:02,618 --> 00:44:04,939
Speaker 0: also Can I just say the fairies are totally bad?

680
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,779
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

681
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,759
Speaker 0: the fairies that whole scene at the end where each stone fairy like turns back into a fairy person or fairy ghost.

682
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:24,580
Speaker 1: but All the different fairies they made and how they look at how that scene worked and that's one with the shield I guess every one of those fairy stones They didn't turn back to life like the ones who turned to stone didn't like come into bodies again.

683
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:29,173
Speaker 1: It was almost like their essence appeared that that animation that whole end sequence.

684
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:31,660
Speaker 1: I was choking back tears the entire time.

685
00:44:32,483 --> 00:44:36,036
Speaker 1: It was like a certain sweep in near the end of Madoka Magica.

686
00:44:36,317 --> 00:44:41,339
Speaker 0: that montage You could also think of it as a sweep at the end of Evangelion was a million crosses going.

687
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,754
Speaker 1: But like I said This is the sweep of the fairies of Irish myth to the end.

688
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:49,244
Speaker 1: the modern era has Disciplanted them.

689
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:53,120
Speaker 1: the the the fairy world came to terms with the fact that it is dead.

690
00:44:53,582 --> 00:44:56,119
Speaker 1: The selkies came to terms with the fact that they are gone.

691
00:44:56,783 --> 00:45:00,360
Speaker 1: The boy and his father come to terms with the fact that their mother is gone.

692
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:05,075
Speaker 0: Well his wife The mother's dad's mother still there.

693
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:09,199
Speaker 1: Yes mother I could have framed that better that sentence.

694
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:12,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, even even grandma right?

695
00:45:12,386 --> 00:45:13,189
Speaker 0: It's like the whole time.

696
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:15,296
Speaker 0: grandma is just the bad person right?

697
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,540
Speaker 0: She wants him to move to the city.

698
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,185
Speaker 0: You know she's grumpy.

699
00:45:18,586 --> 00:45:19,710
Speaker 0: She's not happy.

700
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:27,340
Speaker 0: You know I get you get the idea that maybe she used to be cool But she's not and I didn't think at all that grandma would turn good.

701
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:30,100
Speaker 0: I thought the happy ending would be just get away from grandma grandma.

702
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,727
Speaker 0: How much grandma keeps being a crab in the city?

703
00:45:32,907 --> 00:45:33,068
Speaker 0: well?

704
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:35,353
Speaker 1: What was grandma's character arc?

705
00:45:35,594 --> 00:45:37,759
Speaker 1: was it possibly that she recognized?

706
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,720
Speaker 1: How broken up the father was by it and realized that maybe she can't keep him static.

707
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:51,613
Speaker 1: She's trying to mold him into like this different type of father Yeah, and this different type of family, and I think she has to.

708
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:55,907
Speaker 0: she realizes that that couldn't work So she tries to do it herself.

709
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:58,035
Speaker 0: She's like oh, you can't raise these kids properly.

710
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:00,228
Speaker 0: You're all crazy You know.

711
00:46:00,248 --> 00:46:07,078
Speaker 0: since you don't have a wife anymore I'm taking these kids away, and he's so turned to stone basically that he just lets it happen.

712
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,452
Speaker 0: He's like all right just go you know whatever.

713
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:14,404
Speaker 0: yep, and he stops being the awesome dad He used to be.

714
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:15,129
Speaker 0: but it's like.

715
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:18,294
Speaker 0: you know he was gonna become an awesome dad again But I didn't think grandma would be.

716
00:46:18,436 --> 00:46:18,739
Speaker 0: you know it.

717
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,392
Speaker 0: I thought it would be one of those things where it's like sorry grandma.

718
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:22,317
Speaker 0: I'm an awesome dad again.

719
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:27,753
Speaker 1: BAM Like it was grandma's nice again - yeah, but in the very beginning like you you see the.

720
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:30,442
Speaker 1: you know the giant like he's physically there.

721
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:33,877
Speaker 1: that rock is just this giant fairy turned to stone from ancient times.

722
00:46:34,078 --> 00:46:37,935
Speaker 1: yeah, and It would be very easy to expect that.

723
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:42,200
Speaker 1: in the end of the movie He wakes up and something you know that might cause things to happen.

724
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:44,146
Speaker 1: But instead he doesn't.

725
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:50,605
Speaker 1: you just see the birds being disturbed by his spirit leaving yep Deeply melancholy that is.

726
00:46:50,705 --> 00:46:54,580
Speaker 1: I can't think of a better word to describe the end of this movie than melancholy.

727
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:55,062
Speaker 1: You know.

728
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:59,260
Speaker 0: the only other thing I'd say is that for something called the song of the sea you know there's a lot of.

729
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,851
Speaker 0: There's a lot of metaphor of water going on right.

730
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:05,708
Speaker 0: the kid is afraid of going in the water He has to go in the well.

731
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:07,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the sister who's a selkie.

732
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:08,240
Speaker 0: She's just like whatever.

733
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,725
Speaker 0: See I'm going in the water, but she's mute.

734
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:20,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, she can't speak or sing and The fairies are all held themselves in stasis because they need a selkie to sing them not to life But basically to death.

735
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:25,720
Speaker 0: yeah, and at the end You know he conquers his fear of the water to go down and get the selkie coat at the bottom of the ocean.

736
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:29,839
Speaker 1: He has a hundred percent like the archetypical hero's journey, right?

737
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,997
Speaker 0: But for even though there's all that water action going on It has surprisingly little sea.

738
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:40,930
Speaker 0: it's mostly a journey over land something that's called the song of the sea.

739
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,848
Speaker 0: There's a mean there is a song of the sea and but there really isn't a lot of sea.

740
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:48,907
Speaker 1: Well cuz they have to get back to the sea.

741
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,400
Speaker 1: yeah There's like a song to the sea.

742
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:57,078
Speaker 0: there's a sea at the beginning There's a sea near the end and there's a little bit of water in the middle But mostly land.

743
00:47:57,399 --> 00:48:04,050
Speaker 0: and I was like I thought this was gonna have fishies And you know a little more a little mermaid action going on there wasn't.

744
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,483
Speaker 1: It was just and the story because of the allegory, and it's just.

745
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:12,785
Speaker 1: it's so well paced and so consistent beginning to end.

746
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:15,434
Speaker 1: I Really like this movie a lot.

747
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:17,441

Speaker 0: well the movie.

767
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:58,357

00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,861
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it's different.

769
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:02,970
Speaker 1: Here's how I would describe snowpiercer the movie it is.

770
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:06,470
Speaker 1: It is like Robin Williams toys.

771
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:09,262
Speaker 0: The comic is not like that.

772
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:13,344
Speaker 1: okay That's interesting, but coupled with wool.

773
00:49:13,464 --> 00:49:17,861
Speaker 1: It is wool the novel Written like toys with Robin Williams.

774
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,326

776
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:24,122
