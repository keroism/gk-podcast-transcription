1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,717
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday September 12th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,660
Speaker 1: tonight We continue origins week with detail of how we discovered video games.

3
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:20,357
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:29,039
Speaker 0: Well, we're a bit by bit planning our trip to uber con in New Jersey this year where we will be doing a podcasting panel And probably some other fun things.

5
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:33,238
Speaker 1: The uber con it is an awesome convention of awesome.

6
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,700
Speaker 0: now We're not as some of you have asked going to do a pregame show for uber con.

7
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:43,580
Speaker 1: We've really only do pregame shows for Otakon and if we went to PAX we might do a pregame show.

8
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:52,224
Speaker 1: Or if we were going to e3 if it existed anymore Or if we're going to anime Expo or anything big like San Diego comic-con We would get a pregame show.

9
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:56,760
Speaker 0: much of the smallest con that I would even consider doing a pregame show for be katsu khan.

10
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:01,442
Speaker 0: And if then only because there's a chance we'll be doing a lot at katsu khan Yeah pretty much.

11
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:12,441
Speaker 0: the pregame show is for the conventions with at least 20,000 people and no other conventions or Conventions that are so awesome that you multiply the number of people there by some arbitrary number of like 1.6.

12
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,207
Speaker 1: So here's your uber con pregame show everyone.

13
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,934
Speaker 1: You're ready go to uber con.

14
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:25,989
Speaker 0: go on Friday Play awesome games play in Luke cranes game called burning wheel Inheritance playing that and also come see us.

15
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:26,771
Speaker 0: Yep.

16
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,840
Speaker 0: Our panel will likely be from 11 to noon on Saturday.

17
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:31,746
Speaker 0: It'll be the typical podcasting panel though.

18
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:47,252
Speaker 0: We might be sharing it with two other podcasters though I think that would be interesting because I don't know if there are many Podcasters out there who would go to the kind of cons we go to Or not to sound conceited but as professional as we are.

19
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who these podcasters are.

20
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:50,470
Speaker 1: Are they someone we know?

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,439
Speaker 1: are they someone we don't know?

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,210
Speaker 0: I don't really know who they are, but I didn't really look.

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,680
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look up who they are tonight sometime.

24
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:57,906
Speaker 1: Oh, did they tell you they are?

25
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,640
Speaker 0: they told me two people who might want to share the panel with us.

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,293
Speaker 0: They gave names and I didn't recognize the names off hand.

27
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:05,644
Speaker 1: if it's those dragons landing guys I listen to their show.

28
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,167
Speaker 1: They're cool.

29
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who else it could be.

30
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:08,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll find out.

31
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,324
Speaker 0: I just I get the.

32
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:18,720
Speaker 0: I get the expectation that the panel that if we ever shared a panel with anyone Would just be us talking and us correcting anyone else who said anything.

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might be.

34
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,578
Speaker 1: we'll see what we do about panels at the sitcom.

35
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,657
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, we'll talk more about sitcom tomorrow because it is more of an anime thing than a gaming thing.

36
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:30,199
Speaker 1: That's right.

37
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:41,320
Speaker 0: But anyway today is game day and we have a lot of well Video game related talk since we're doing origins week and many of you have been wondering how we got into video games.

38
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,145
Speaker 1: That is what we're gonna talk about.

39
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,091
Speaker 1: But first the news is.

40
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:47,960
Speaker 1: the news is and today was Apple Day.

41
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,068
Speaker 1: Everybody knows it yada yada yada now.

42
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,653
Speaker 0: I gotta say Apple Apple Apple.

43
00:02:52,873 --> 00:03:05,350
Speaker 0: This was probably the least Anticipated Apple Day there has ever been for my perspective because I barely remembered it happened and I totally forgot about it And I thought all right.

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,475
Speaker 0: I have an iPod nano.

45
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:07,540
Speaker 0: It's pretty badass.

46
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:14,767
Speaker 0: I can't imagine them releasing anything other than possibly a larger nano Hard drive wise or a nano in a different color.

47
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,251
Speaker 1: Well nanos don't have hard drives.

48
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:16,873
Speaker 1: They have flash.

49
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:19,160
Speaker 0: But yeah a larger storage mechanism.

50
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, what did Apple release today?

51
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,652
Speaker 1: I'll sum it up real quick.

52
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:23,134
Speaker 1: Number one.

53
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:26,646
Speaker 1: They got a new shuffle that doesn't suck It's smaller and better.

54
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:29,175
Speaker 1: They have new nanos.

55
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:37,400
Speaker 1: They're basically the same as the nanos We already have except they're like the mini with the with the metal instead of the scratched up plastic so they won't scratch up.

56
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:38,640
Speaker 0: They'll be twice as durable.

57
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,511
Speaker 1: Right and if you get the 2 gig one you have to get silver.

58
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,262
Speaker 1: if you get the 4 gig you can get green blue Or pink.

59
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:48,120
Speaker 1: and if you get the 8 gig nano the new 8 gig nano comes only in black.

60
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:54,139
Speaker 0: That is a lot like what I used to happen back in the realm the first MMO.

61
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:58,218
Speaker 0: I bring it up only because I remember this and it happened in puzzle pirates, too.

62
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 0: By making the black item only available with the highest end item People now have more incentive to buy the highest end item who might not otherwise need the 8 gigabytes.

63
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,231
Speaker 1: Because now all of a sudden you're cool.

64
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,300
Speaker 1: You have the black one.

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,843
Speaker 0: You know what?

66
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,757
Speaker 0: I'm cool because I have a black nano and you can all go to hell.

67
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,363
Speaker 1: personally I have a black nano.

68
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,267
Speaker 1: that's 4 gigs.

69
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:28,280
Speaker 1: and if I was buying a nano today, and I didn't have one right now I would buy that metal green one or that metal blue one because the metal is way better than the scratching plastic.

70
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,050
Speaker 0: The thing is my nanos not scratched up at all.

71
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:33,260
Speaker 1: No because you yours came with a protect II thing.

72
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,565
Speaker 0: It's not just a protect II thing.

73
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,031
Speaker 0: It's also a buffer.

74
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,180
Speaker 0: every time I put it in it cleans it and polishes it.

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,669
Speaker 1: Well, I don't have one of those things.

76
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,520
Speaker 1: how you saw cuz I bought my nano right away.

77
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,505
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know what?

78
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,515
Speaker 0: because I purchased my Apple product later.

79
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,560
Speaker 0: It is far superior.

80
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:50,372
Speaker 1: They also came out with new regular iPods black and white.

81
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:53,542
Speaker 1: they think there's a 30 gig and an 80.

82
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:54,689
Speaker 1: I'm not sure they're big.

83
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,189
Speaker 1: They're the regular iPods But they have higher resolution screens.

84
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:05,094
Speaker 1: So now the video is 640 by 480 and the screen is brighter but it's the same size screen as before.

85
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:08,603
Speaker 1: oh and Yeah, that's about.

86
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:12,595
Speaker 1: and iTunes 7 which I whatever I actually that's the most.

87
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,480
Speaker 1: that's if anything isn't cool.

88
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:19,620
Speaker 1: That's what's cool because iTunes 7 sucks way less than iTunes 6 really.

89
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:23,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, I installed it on this computer and I upgraded the little Mac mini downstairs.

90
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:24,260
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

91
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,280
Speaker 0: Oh, see, I haven't looked because I put a whole bunch of podcast.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,289
Speaker 0: I listen to so many podcasts now that I haven't had to update my nano in like a week So I haven't even touched the Mac downstairs.

93
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:44,080
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I just I just did it when I got home I upgraded the one downstairs and I upgraded this as soon as possible and a lot of the Difficulties people have with iTunes will now no longer be a problem.

94
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:52,731
Speaker 1: It's now easier to use your iPod and like a bunch of different computers that all have iTunes You know It's easier to have multiple iPods on the same computer.

95
00:05:52,751 --> 00:06:00,359
Speaker 1: a lot of the options that a lot of people Needed to use but didn't know how to use or hidden away in the options menu and now they're right up front.

96
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,072
Speaker 1: The software that updates your iPods firmware is now part of iTunes.

97
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,400
Speaker 1: You don't have to go downloading that separately all the time.

98
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,426
Speaker 1: There's a lot of good stuff in there now.

99
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:10,469
Speaker 1: It's way cool.

100
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,071
Speaker 0: Huh?

101
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:18,673
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's still iTunes But it's better than the old iTunes significantly and it's free.

102
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:23,466
Speaker 0: I mean, I got to say it's sad to me that iTunes really isn't that great.

103
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:29,967
Speaker 0: all things considered it really isn't the only for like podcasting and everything except that While it's far from great.

104
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,840
Speaker 0: It's pretty much better than any other solution.

105
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:47,999
Speaker 1: That's in terms of synchronizing with the iPod or any mp3 player for that matter, you know The whole process of getting podcasts maintaining, you know Your podcast collection and then synchronizing it with an mp3 playing device.

106
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:59,806
Speaker 1: iTunes is the only program that does it all in one go in a smooth way, you know It's iTunes 6 or 7 7 is just slightly smoother, you know And no other program can do that.

107
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:05,120
Speaker 1: Even though iTunes is kind of crappy at like music management and all this other stuff.

108
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:12,187
Speaker 1: Oh, they added other stuff too like iTunes 7 will now just go out and get album covers for songs you have Really?

109
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,160
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, even my pirated songs.

110
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,960
Speaker 1: Supposedly it says when you uh, you need to decide to enable that option.

111
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:27,195
Speaker 1: It says that we are going to send information, you know to get the album covers But Apple is not keeping any information about any songs you have.

112
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:28,360
Speaker 1: That's what it says.

113
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,243
Speaker 0: It's like out.

114
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:33,260
Speaker 0: I doubt that Apple would have album covers for the vast majority of my music collection.

115
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:38,128
Speaker 1: I also doubt that but Supposedly they're gonna get album covers somehow.

116
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,878
Speaker 0: So hey, I'm really curious about that.

117
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,787
Speaker 1: Yeah Actually, I turned it on but I haven't.

118
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,520
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try it out in a bit to see how it actually works.

119
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,260
Speaker 0: Well, we've got on the Mac right now some cat Empire and some Tom McRae and stuff so we could try that.

120
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it has to be something that's like in the iTunes music store for it to work.

121
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:56,885
Speaker 1: I don't know.

122
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,640
Speaker 1: I had to go and investigate.

123
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:03,886
Speaker 1: Another thing is there's talk of this ITV which is like it's.

124
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,092
Speaker 1: I don't think it's out but it's gonna be out.

125
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,837
Speaker 1: It's basically a little.

126
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:11,850
Speaker 1: it's like a flat Flatter wider Mac mini, but it's not a computer.

127
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:17,567
Speaker 1: You just plug it into your your TV You know your big screen real television.

128
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:25,011
Speaker 1: and then what you can do is from any iTunes, you know on the same network You can say hey see that video.

129
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,204
Speaker 1: I have play it out of that Television over there.

130
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:42,280
Speaker 1: and so that way you can download things off of iTunes like movies and play them out of your television Sort of like the Airport Express allows you to play music from your iTunes on your computer out of your stereo If you have you know with the audio out hole.

131
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:51,572
Speaker 0: Yeah I'd be a lot more impressed by that if it weren't for the fact that at least as a geek those problems are easily solved With cables that connect various devices together and a computer.

132
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:55,848
Speaker 1: Yes had a computer and okay The last two bits of news in the whole thing.

133
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:58,560
Speaker 1: or that you can buy games for your iPod for five bucks.

134
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,389
Speaker 1: Why fucking dollars you get?

135
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:06,722
Speaker 1: you can get Tetris you can get pac-man you can be jeweled $5.

136
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:11,460
Speaker 1: yeah, I was thinking about doing it just to try it out and to have five one dollars.

137
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a lot of money for a probably mediocre game.

138
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:20,490
Speaker 0: with that You couldn't control so easily because it's on your iPod.

139
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,260
Speaker 1: Well, the iPod is up down left right and a button.

140
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,504
Speaker 1: That's it's not so bad.

141
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:27,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm real leery that plus five bucks.

142
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:28,940
Speaker 0: I could see it being a dollar.

143
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:32,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought about it for a minute just to see how it work.

144
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,532
Speaker 1: But hey, it's like I could understand.

145
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,785
Speaker 1: maybe on the normal iPod It might be a little better.

146
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:42,049
Speaker 0: on the note in terms of up down left right button My cell phone is the exact same loadout.

147
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,419
Speaker 1: Yeah cell phone games are five bucks, too.

148
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,252
Speaker 0: Well now the cell phone games on my phone are $2.

149
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:52,800
Speaker 0: the ones on my phone are $5 But the thing is they're all terrible and they're not worth any amount of money.

150
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,430
Speaker 1: There was gonna be a Phoenix Wright, but I haven't seen it yet.

151
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,280
Speaker 0: Whatever anything Phoenix Wright would also come out to the DS.

152
00:09:58,401 --> 00:09:58,985
Speaker 0: We'll see.

153
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,356
Speaker 0: There's no worries on that front.

154
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:00,759
Speaker 0: We'll see.

155
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:04,339
Speaker 1: Anyway, the last thing is that all the iPods are cheaper now.

156
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,599
Speaker 1: The now the 8 gig iPod cost as my iPod nano cost the same amount as like the 30 gig iPod.

157
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,383
Speaker 0: god Damn it.

158
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:12,570
Speaker 1: It's the same price.

159
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,260
Speaker 0: I just bought an iPod nano.

160
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:41,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought one as soon as it came out So I got the least screwed possible, but you know, the thing is that it's actually kind of good about this particular iPod upgrade season is that these aren't really sixth sixth generation iPods, you know these are more like the 5.5 generation iPods because I mean when our Fifth generation iPods came out the previous generation of iPods is basically useless like they couldn't do any of the new stuff.

161
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:46,560
Speaker 1: I have a fifth generation iPod and I can get in on all this new iTunes stuff.

162
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,740
Speaker 1: I can download the games I can pretty much everything except the video which I couldn't do anyway because I have a nano.

163
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:58,872
Speaker 1: You know for all intents and purposes other than the metal casing My 4 gig nano is just as good as the new 4 gig nano.

164
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:04,512
Speaker 1: So I'm not so upset and Probably some when my nano dies.

165
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:08,559
Speaker 1: I'll reconsider my portable media device options.

166
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:14,919
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, I'll be quick about my bit of news because we imagine we could talk a lot about our main bit today.

167
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:18,951
Speaker 0: We could indeed but Facebook has been impressed a lot lately.

168
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:22,040
Speaker 0: first because they added all this user tracking stuff.

169
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,559
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't really adding anything.

170
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:36,097
Speaker 0: It just they added reporting where now there was a little feed where all your friends could see what you do on the site all the time which sparked Massive outrage among hundreds of thousands of Facebook users.

171
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:36,780
Speaker 0: Uh-huh

172
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:47,439
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that many people were still using it Like I used it and then I just kind of let it sit there and if it ever emails me which means like someone from my past is looking for me then I can get the emails and I'll go check it.

173
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,880
Speaker 1: but Otherwise, they just let it sit there.

174
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,169
Speaker 0: see a lot of people use Facebook a lot.

175
00:11:51,409 --> 00:12:02,080
Speaker 0: basically everyone who wants that sort of thing and Doesn't want to use myspace for obvious reasons use Facebook Mm-hmm, but Facebook as everyone knows was fairly off-limits.

176
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:11,299
Speaker 0: You had to be in a school and they've opened it up bit by bit over the years But you had to be basically a student somewhere or like an employee of a company like Apple to get in on it.

177
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:20,734
Speaker 0: Now they've said they're opening it up to the world and once again Facebook users have protested in the many many many thousands.

178
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,440
Speaker 0: They're incredibly pissed off.

179
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:29,100
Speaker 1: My prediction is that at first Facebook will become infinitely more usable as more and more people get into it.

180
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:36,240
Speaker 1: Like how many people from my past, you know have might have been looking for me But they couldn't because they didn't go to school so they didn't get on Facebook.

181
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,680
Speaker 1: And well, do I really want to see those people is another story?

182
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:48,058
Speaker 0: Plus there's the fact that I kind of wanted to get in on Facebook way back But I had effectively left our IT and I there's really no way I could as an alumni thingy.

183
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:49,339
Speaker 1: That's how I'm in there.

184
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,897
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point the other thing is I predict that very soon some random country will take over Facebook.

185
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,508
Speaker 0: pick a country I'd say Brazil, but they're so in trend up.

186
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:01,110
Speaker 1: Brazil's are.

187
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,876
Speaker 1: it's gonna be Peruvian Facebook.

188
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,023
Speaker 1: I'm telling you right now Who's gonna take it over.

189
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:09,137
Speaker 0: the thing is no one took over myspace except punk kids.

190
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,859
Speaker 1: Yep Punk kids are their own country now.

191
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,785
Speaker 0: Well, the worry is that now that it's open all the people in there are worried that it's just gonna descend into the depths That myspace is in.

192
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:23,560
Speaker 1: I don't think so because Facebook is a different thing from myspace.

193
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,540
Speaker 1: My space is you make a page where you basically advertise yourself and chat with friends.

194
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:31,300
Speaker 1: Facebook is more of a find.

195
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:39,386
Speaker 1: You know people you went to school with in high school in college and you know Arrange for parties and only.

196
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:43,496
Speaker 1: it really doesn't have the expanded functionality and freedom that myspace has.

197
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,866
Speaker 1: so you can't make a terrible web Page with Facebook all you can do.

198
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:50,960
Speaker 1: I mean it does less than Orkut does, you know, it's very single purpose.

199
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:59,332
Speaker 0: well the other thing I think it won't fall the to the faith that Orkut fell to at least because The main failing of Orkut was that it was very spammable.

200
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,800
Speaker 0: it trusted everyone to not be an asshole.

201
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:09,026
Speaker 0: Because if it's invite only nous, yeah, and it was fine until some guy Invited some Brazilian kids someday.

202
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:16,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do think though that Facebook might have to worry about spammers people making fake pages like hey I'm a girl at your college.

203
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,259
Speaker 1: come out with me, you know that sort of thing.

204
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:21,355
Speaker 0: Why don't we make a whole bunch of pages that are I'm a girl.

205
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,059
Speaker 0: come out with me.

206
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:23,807
Speaker 1: Why would we do that?

207
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:26,840
Speaker 0: you sounded like me because then I don't know we could lure.

208
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:30,131
Speaker 1: You want to lure boys into your bed?

209
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:31,759
Speaker 1: Yes, we know we're in.

210
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,428
Speaker 1: Yes You want to lure all the college boys into your bed?

211
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,196
Speaker 0: I believe that that was more of a topic for tomorrow.

212
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:46,740
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, yeah, I might jump on just because Facebook might be slightly useful if anything for geek.

213
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,160
Speaker 1: Yes, I just keep my page up there in case people from my past That's a good place that they might know to look for me.

214
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:59,031
Speaker 0: My Orkut is still up there and I occasionally get email from Brazilian people trying to convince me to join whatever Spanish group they formed.

215
00:14:59,212 --> 00:14:59,554
Speaker 1: I don't.

216
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:10,270
Speaker 0: thankfully Tonight I have very special and very sad thing of the day.

217
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:11,753
Speaker 1: So special

218
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:29,030
Speaker 0: this is see but I have a tiny glimmer of hope that this is a joke because 4chan has been known to pull jokes like this before where they make up the kind of person they don't like and Then they they basically make their own straw man and then beat that straw man at the Internet.

219
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:41,080
Speaker 0: I mean they've done it before at Otacon once they had a guy Pretend to be a perverted furry guy in a fursuit and then they had another guy attack him and like another year They put someone up to do something stupid as some other they just.

220
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:47,750
Speaker 0: they seem to do that sort of thing a lot But at the same time I've known people like this guy.

221
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:51,529
Speaker 0: I've seen people like this guy and I really am.

222
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:58,650
Speaker 0: I'm doubtful that this guy is not entirely sincere in his internet bravado.

223
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,769
Speaker 0: This is a video of a man a fat man a fat stuttering man.

224
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:17,898
Speaker 0: There's a nervous fat man who's emotionally problem Trying to put forth his manifesto to the internet that all of the 4chan people who invade his chat rooms And the YMNTD.

225
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,006
Speaker 0: Yes the YMNTD.

226
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,050
Speaker 0: He says that twice.

227
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,695
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's YTMND.

228
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,899
Speaker 1: You the man now dawg.

229
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,221
Speaker 1: Of course.

230
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:25,525
Speaker 1: You ain't the man now.

231
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:26,468
Speaker 1: You were never the man.

232
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:27,050
Speaker 1: You're the loser.

233
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,364
Speaker 0: He basically says I'm this awesome guy.

234
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:40,907
Speaker 0: I Am going after this because I'm dressed up to the graduation of my sister or something from police academy Just a little aside there that he brings up.

235
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:46,370
Speaker 0: And he you know join me smart people in the fight against these 4chan idiots.

236
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:49,882
Speaker 0: I have gotten the police to go after all of you.

237
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,070
Speaker 0: They'll be knocking on your doors shortly.

238
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:59,628
Speaker 0: That's what you get burn fading my chat rooms and generally annoying people on the internet and being 4channers.

239
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:07,490
Speaker 1: Yes, you're not free to be a punk kid while there is a fat Christian idiot guy talking on YouTube.

240
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:20,470
Speaker 0: I don't think we're religion bashing at this point, which we do occasionally Somewhat often but in this case the guy very specifically at the end out of the blue for no just says You guys can't stop me from preaching Christianity.

241
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:25,005
Speaker 1: He's like I'll continue to preach Jesus the word of Jesus in my chat rooms.

242
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:30,694
Speaker 1: It's like Alright, but if you leave your chat room open You can't complain of.

243
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,882
Speaker 1: a bunch of 4chan kids come in there and harass you.

244
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:36,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like uh, you know Where's your God now?

245
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,509
Speaker 1: How come he's not, you know punishing these 4chan kids who were supposedly like?

246
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:41,374
Speaker 0: actually You know why?

247
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:45,378
Speaker 0: because if he were a Christian or you know I actually studied all that stuff.

248
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,150
Speaker 0: the New Testament has a lot of things about how Don't get revenge on people now because God will take care of that later.

249
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,460
Speaker 1: But isn't he trying to get revenge on people now, but oh supposedly.

250
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:58,670
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe he's not the best kind of Christian.

251
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:10,130
Speaker 1: It's one of those people just you know says a bunch of Christian words and believe was what he wants to believe and is stupid and insane and is a person and is the kind of person who makes this world the worst place and he's fat.

252
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:17,030
Speaker 0: The sad thing is I've seen a lot of people like this before and there's things like YouTube have gotten more prevalent.

253
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:27,324
Speaker 0: It is a lot easier for people like this guy to put themselves in front of the veritable Steamroller that is popular internet culture.

254
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:33,150
Speaker 0: this guy Is going to be completely bowled over by everyone who thinks he's sad?

255
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:40,570
Speaker 1: yeah, it's sort of like if You know a Jewish woman walked into Syria or Iran like hey, what's up?

256
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,709
Speaker 1: Not wearing any you know the cover-ups you wear a bikini like hey no no she'd have to walk in and scream about how.

257
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's basically what this guy's doing and You know.

258
00:18:55,233 --> 00:19:00,649
Speaker 0: now you can see the armies of 4chan have already destroyed all the comments on this video.

259
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,657
Speaker 1: They have indeed.

260
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,786
Speaker 0: I mean this guy really reminds me of Things that I got to get off of my chest hurting this community more.

261
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:12,778
Speaker 0: so now Deep in other people all right.

262
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:25,742
Speaker 1: well you get real deep into that guy cuz he's so fat All right, so there was a thread in our forum about Mighty Max, which is an old cartoon and toy.

263
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,340
Speaker 1: I guess I'm not a hundred percent sure and Someone who is the someone up?

264
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:31,589
Speaker 1: I do our friend I do.

265
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:42,972
Speaker 1: She said she remembers the show and Apparently he looked on IMDb and the show Mighty Max had a storyline about Cthulhu.

266
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,078
Speaker 0: oh really yeah really.

267
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:48,447
Speaker 1: so I went to the IMDb and you know what I noticed there.

268
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:58,349
Speaker 1: it says Apparently there was another cartoon show a cartoon show that I actually watched which also had an episode about Cthulhu.

269
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:06,558
Speaker 0: now After I saw this episode I might have seen that but not known what Cthulhu was back then.

270
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,909
Speaker 1: I believe that might have also been.

271
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:19,508
Speaker 1: my Situation is that when I was a kid I might have seen this episode of this show and not Realized what I was seeing because I didn't know about Cthulhu mythos till like I got to college.

272
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:21,221
Speaker 0: so Scott What were you seeing I?

273
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:28,138
Speaker 1: Was well of course as soon as I realized that there was an episode of the show dealing with Cthulhu I've searched for it on YouTube.

274
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,597
Speaker 1: lo and behold there it was photography photography.

275
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:39,601
Speaker 1: there is an episode of the real Ghostbusters Written by what was the guy's name Michael Evans or something.

276
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:44,436
Speaker 0: well Scott just updated the Wikipedia article about him to add this Ghostbusters episode to his credit list.

277
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:54,513
Speaker 1: I did and it's in the Ghostbusters episode where the Ghostbusters Fight Cthulhu and there's an evil cult who summons him and there's an economic on and a Miskatonic University.

278
00:20:54,533 --> 00:21:01,949
Speaker 0: the best part is that at the end one the crazy cultist is being dragged away And he starts quoting basically HP Lovecraft at them.

279
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,768
Speaker 1: They quote this HP Lovecraft all over this episode like you think it's just.

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,970
Speaker 1: I mean the name of the episode is the collect call of Cthulhu.

283
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:20,330
Speaker 0: They spell it wrong But we're pretty sure that was just a copyright issue and to help kids read because it was you know phonetically correct.

284
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:24,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I was a little kid, and I saw a word spelled like Cthulhu I don't think I know what to do with that.

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,454
Speaker 1: I would know to do it either.

286
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,850

287
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,110
Speaker 1: It's still tolerable to watch it today, and the voice acting was really good.

288
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,610

00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,613
Speaker 1: it sounds just like him and There's good writing.

Speaker 0: Well.

312
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:10,209
Speaker 0: I've noticed that aside from a contingent of about 60 people most people don't seem to check the forum every day.

313
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:16,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is probably good because the forum is getting to the point where we're going to have to hire more moderators.

314
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:17,535
Speaker 1: I think it might.

315
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:17,997
Speaker 1: mr..

316
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:19,985

318
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:31,830

319
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:37,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I mean It would have been something if you were winning by one vote.

320
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,984
Speaker 1: now I would turn it over you know, but we already did the intro to the show.

321
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,955
Speaker 0: so so once again Democracy matters.

322
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:45,159
Speaker 0: one vote counts.

323
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:50,644
Speaker 0: you could have been the one if you thought you wanted to hear us talk about Role-playing games, and you didn't vote in that survey.

324
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:57,166
Speaker 1: This is your fault Yeah, so um you should join the forum, and you should watch out for when.

329
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:11,638
Speaker 1: I can remove the pole But I can't just like close it projects.

00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:26,908

00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:27,470
Speaker 1: I don't know.

334
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,970

335
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:37,147
Speaker 0: We at least have mad old-school video game credentials, that's for sure.

00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:50,850
Speaker 0: My mom played the Atari 2600 our family had while she was pregnant with me, and I remember very specifically.

340
00:24:50,971 --> 00:25:03,386
Speaker 0: she liked the 2600 because the Controls on it on the actual physical box were these big metal switches that stuck out and she could stick her foot over and reset Games without having to sit up while she was pregnant.

341
00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:06,657
Speaker 1: Yeah My mom just liked to play breakout with the paddles.

342
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:11,311
Speaker 0: also my grandpa on my father's side had an Atari 2600.

343
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:12,255
Speaker 0: He played all the time.

344
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:21,089
Speaker 0: my dad played Atari all the time in addition to my mom and on my other Grandparents side they had an Intellivision 2 and an Intellivision that they played all the time.

00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:23,617
Speaker 1: man?

347
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:27,087

Speaker 0: Wow And my my dad was.

349
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:33,610
Speaker 0: I mean we'll talk about this game called kaboom in a minute.

350
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:48,490
Speaker 0: It was not until I was about 20 that I finally surpassed my father's skill at kaboom Mmm, but I've been playing video games my entire life.

351
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:55,090
Speaker 0: My family was playing video games many many many years before they even decided to have children.

352
00:25:55,551 --> 00:26:01,306
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I came out with the breakout in the pac-man on the Atari 2600, but it broke eventually.

353
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:08,050
Speaker 1: and you know I continued to play mad video games, you know, I was playing Nintendo at every one of my friends houses.

354
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,590
Speaker 1: I mean, I think the first time I saw an NES was at my cousin's house.

355
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,808
Speaker 1: It must have been between kindergarten and first grade maybe even at very very early in life.

356
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:24,147
Speaker 1: I went to My cousin's house and he had Nintendo and he played Super Mario Brothers 1 and I didn't.

357
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:25,110
Speaker 1: I didn't even really understand.

358
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:29,075
Speaker 1: We were getting into there, you know Yeah Cuz at first I play.

359
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:37,286
Speaker 0: I remember I played Mario 1 at my friend Joe Ogilvy's house and I had at that point an Atari 7800 which I was convinced with the pinnacle of fucking gaming.

360
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:37,970
Speaker 0: that thing was fantastic.

361
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:50,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, I I usually I still have my Atari and all my games and you know what to this day I enjoy my Atari and NES games more than I enjoy most other games.

362
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:51,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

363
00:26:52,192 --> 00:27:00,830
Speaker 0: But I remember I was went over and I watched him play Super Mario Brothers 1 and he beat world 1. right and you know There's that cutscene where Mario goes underground.

364
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,700
Speaker 0: I got pissed cuz he.

365
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:08,010
Speaker 0: every time I watched him play He'd always walk into the side pipe and I always said why don't you go in the top pipe?

366
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,112
Speaker 1: That's right.

367
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:09,995
Speaker 1: Is it different?

368
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,287
Speaker 0: and he would just look at me with his look of God.

369
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:16,497

Speaker 0: I remember when I put the day my parents bought the Nintendo.

374
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:28,578
Speaker 0: we went to Pizza Hut and They had one of those Nintendo coin ops.

375
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:31,589
Speaker 0: It was basically an NES and you could play like Mario Brothers on it.

376
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:36,281
Speaker 0: and it was in the Pizza Hut and My dad was like dad.

Speaker 1: you know Real arcade games.

382
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:44,390
Speaker 1: remember our Pizza Hut had like a Sega Genesis you would put a quarter in to play Altered Beast.

383
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,702
Speaker 0: My Pizza Hut also had operation wolf.

384
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,290
Speaker 1: Whoa, it was great.

385
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,827
Speaker 0: It was a good game, but then my dad looks at me and says no You can't play it now cuz we're gonna go buy one after this.

386
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:06,955
Speaker 0: my reaction was I Was I was dumbfounded that I would now be able to play that game Anytime I wanted.

387
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:08,381
Speaker 0: I only played.

388
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,610
Speaker 0: I didn't get another Nintendo game for like a month.

389
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:13,169
Speaker 0: I was happy playing Mario 1 and duck hunt.

390
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:17,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but I had a lot of Nintendo experience at my friends houses my cousin's house.

391
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,120
Speaker 1: I remember these two guys.

392
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:20,290
Speaker 1: I forget who they were.

393
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,283
Speaker 1: They were just some friends that I guess we stopped talking to at some point.

394
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,850
Speaker 1: who what they had robbed the robot.

395
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:33,746
Speaker 1: they were so old-school and I would put like Donkey Kong and spy hunter at their house and Zelda 1. and I Played a whole lot of Nintendo at a whole lot of places except my house.

396
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:43,350
Speaker 1: until one day I did get a Nintendo like around like 87 and he I don't know Megaman 2 was out at the time so that that'll give you a good estimate.

397
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,646
Speaker 1: One of the first Nintendo and my Nintendo came with a red light gun.

398
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:47,370
Speaker 0: so did mine.

399
00:28:47,571 --> 00:28:50,950
Speaker 0: Okay, but my friend Joe Ogilvy had the gray one, but it was broken.

400
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,054
Speaker 0: So then he bought a red one.

401
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:54,645
Speaker 1: our Nintendo had the red light gun and I got mega.

402
00:28:54,826 --> 00:29:03,879
Speaker 1: basically was on my birthday I remember because I got the Nintendo the day before my birthday and I played Mario 1 and duck hunt and the next day I got Megaman 2.

403
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:10,510
Speaker 0: the first game I got for the Nintendo aside from the games It came with were the power pad and the two games that were out for it at the time.

404
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,338
Speaker 0: Well, two of the three games that were out.

405
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:14,770
Speaker 1: Oh, see I got a Nintendo way before the power pad came out.

406
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,310
Speaker 0: You know, I didn't get games for it for a long time because the Nintendo was expensive.

407
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:21,550
Speaker 0: So I had to contend myself with Mario 1 and duck hunt.

408
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:28,450
Speaker 1: I see we we didn't get a lot of games total But we got games at sort of a steady rate of like one or two every six months.

409
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,236
Speaker 1: See what we did is like birthdays.

410
00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:34,110
Speaker 1: We got games and then the holidays you got rented a lot of games.

411
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:38,809
Speaker 0: Pretty much every week we would go and rent like two Nintendo games.

412
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,430
Speaker 1: Well, see we did some renting.

413
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,703
Speaker 1: I remember renting fix an ado and I remember renting a few other games.

414
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:50,930
Speaker 1: and we did a lot of borrowing and trading with the Friends, it's something a lot of people don't do nowadays because you know, there are other ways to do to do that.

415
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,846
Speaker 0: The front row crew does extensively.

416
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:58,010
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, but I'm saying like in those days the trading was heavy and much more coveted.

417
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,515
Speaker 0: Remember the trade with.

418
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:00,739
Speaker 0: hide lied that I pulled off.

419
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,121
Speaker 1: Yep.

420
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,626
Speaker 0: All right, there's this kid.

421
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:03,870
Speaker 0: I think his name was Dave.

422
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:04,614
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

423
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,949
Speaker 0: He was basically chunk from the goonies.

433
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,610
Speaker 0: I want it back.

434
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,057

437
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:16,529
Speaker 0: and I gave it back.

438
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:20,302
Speaker 0: And then I bought Mega Man 3 for $5 at garage sale.

439
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:21,165
Speaker 0: Not three days later.

440
00:31:21,205 --> 00:31:24,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mega Man 3 3 it was my favorite Mega Man.

441
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:27,990
Speaker 1: No Mega Man a lot of people argue between Mega Man 3 and 2.

442
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll put it this way Mega Man 3 was my favorite Mega Man.

443
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:32,170
Speaker 0: Mega Man 2 was the best mega.

444
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:35,659
Speaker 1: Mega Man 3 was pretty much like the last Mega Man.

445
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,644
Speaker 1: That was still a good Mega Man.

446
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:40,815
Speaker 1: So yeah, I mean after that It's pretty much been downhill.

447
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:45,170
Speaker 1: I mean Mega Man x1 was okay, but you know, I like the rest of them there.

448
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:47,914
Speaker 1: I'll play them but I recognize that pretty much.

449
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:53,154
Speaker 1: Mega Man 2 Mega Man 3 and Mega Man x1 are the ones that are worth playing and everything else is Kind of now.

450
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:57,250
Speaker 0: the thing with my family was that my I mean my grandparents my parents my aunt and uncle.

451
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,216
Speaker 0: Everyone was really like.

452
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:01,627
Speaker 0: everyone played video games in my whole family.

453
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:21,270
Speaker 0: So Whenever we got a new video game system like when we had the Atari 7800 the Atari 2600 was plugged into another TV so two people could play at the same time and often times I would come home and the Nintendo was in one room and then Atari was another room and the other Atari's the Other room and I would often decide to play the Atari instead of the Nintendo.

454
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:33,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, when we had the Sega Genesis, I was still break out the Nintendo for some good old-school action Even though it wasn't old-school at that point because I mean the Nintendo lived on well through the 16 era.

455
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:37,740
Speaker 0: the Nintendo lived on Pretty much until the end of the Super Nintendo era.

456
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,804
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty good.

457
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:39,667
Speaker 0: I mean it got the.

458
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:56,105
Speaker 0: the main Stint of gaming in my house well console gaming was that we had the Super Nintendo in my little brother's room and the Nintendo in my room and the Atari's in the living room and Often times I would be in my room trying to go to sleep but my brother would.

459
00:32:56,125 --> 00:33:00,849
Speaker 0: it would be like 11 o'clock at night or midnight and he wanted to play Final Fantasy and he wouldn't stop.

460
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:05,243
Speaker 0: or Vice versa, I'd be in his room playing Final Fantasy 4 and wouldn't stop.

461
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:09,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just Nintendo just wouldn't die.

462
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,362
Speaker 1: I mean every kid had one.

463
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,910
Speaker 1: It was the one thing that everybody had.

464
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,979
Speaker 1: Everyone had Nintendo games.

465
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:25,890
Speaker 1: if you went to someone's house you played Nintendo Nintendo Nintendo Nintendo NES NES NES, I mean the Nintendo played such a prominent role in my early life.

466
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:29,282
Speaker 1: It was like the focus of my childhood.

467
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:29,804
Speaker 1: without it.

468
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,290
Speaker 1: My life would not be the same.

469
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:39,943
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember when I beat Oh God when I beat a game I would call my friends They would come over immediately to see the ending whatever game I just beat.

470
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:44,901
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah beating a game was a big deal in those Days, I remember specifically beating Zelda 1.

471
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:58,568
Speaker 1: I was sitting there, you know with some friends In my bedroom and I had Zelda 1 going and I'd gotten to Ganon and like on the third try I beat him and everyone was like, whoa Yeah, my little brother my silver fucking arrows would.

472
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:05,370
Speaker 0: some Common thing we would do is we'd sit down and be like you want to beat guerrilla war you want to beat Contra?

473
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:12,197
Speaker 0: And we'd sit down and we beat the game and then we'd watch the end Because guerrilla war had a really funny end.

474
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:16,594
Speaker 1: I also remember beating Megaman 2 like in the living room I was sitting on the floor.

475
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:27,735
Speaker 1: It was like a Saturday morning and it was the cartoons weren't on yet And I think it was in those days when x-men the cartoon was on so I had to beat it before the x-men cartoon Cuz.

476
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:40,578
Speaker 1: I hadn't missed a single episode And I got to the crazy alien and I heard from my friend to use the bubble on him and I got it and I was Like yes, yes, and I did that without Passwords or anything.

477
00:34:40,618 --> 00:34:42,629
Speaker 1: I freakin beat the whole game on my own.

478
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,119
Speaker 1: Like yeah straight through the day.

479
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:57,810
Speaker 0: as a little kid with no cheating or anything I remember very specifically the day I beat Final Fantasy 1 because I I was afraid of chaos because I had that Nintendo Power strategy guide.

480
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:01,030
Speaker 1: We got I was scared to the last level in Zelda, but I did it anyway.

481
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:18,320
Speaker 0: but I was so afraid of chaos that my brother and I were playing the game together and we had decided we had Tried a bunch of parties and we ended up on fighter fighter white mage black mage Which was probably the second best party you could have Other than fighter fighter red mage white mage, but I digress

482
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:21,208
Speaker 1: fighter black belt black mage white man.

483
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,996
Speaker 1: Yes The black belt puns you.

484
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:32,607
Speaker 0: there was a time in my life when quite literally you could say a chess Location in that game and I could tell you with reasonable accuracy.

485
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:33,109
Speaker 0: What was in it?

486
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:40,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the moat like with my brother and I were like I. always we tell each other like if you make it to chaos I don't care if you.

487
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:44,590
Speaker 0: if it's one hit point use every potion you've got before you fight him.

488
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:53,645
Speaker 0: and we were like psyched up and one day I was walking through and fighting and fighting and fighting and I got to chaos and I saw him there and I was like what and spoiler right now.

489
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:57,934
Speaker 0: It was garland What what what what.

490
00:35:58,355 --> 00:35:59,158
Speaker 0: and I clicked on him.

491
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:04,515
Speaker 0: and you know when you beat Final Fantasy 1 you get three screens of text And then that's it.

492
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:17,639
Speaker 0: Yep, and I remember reading those screens of text and not understanding what was going on anyway, and then I beat the game and I just started yelling and yelling and yelling.

493
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:20,990
Speaker 0: and my little brother comes home from school and he's and I'm still yelling.

494
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,934
Speaker 0: He's like, what are you yelling about?

495
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:25,127
Speaker 0: And like I beat Final Fantasy 1 and he's like what.

496
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:34,032
Speaker 0: no It was like the worst thing that ever happened to him Is a pretty terrible thing I Think.

497
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:34,975
Speaker 1: I remember the game.

498
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:37,342
Speaker 1: I actually remember playing a whole hell of a lot.

499
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:40,533
Speaker 1: was a Mario - oh god I love Mario.

500
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 1: - I remember like I borrowed it from someone for a long period of time because it was the borrowed game.

501
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,490
Speaker 1: I played it so much because it was the borrowed game.

502
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,270
Speaker 0: Yep, like when I rented a game I played the ever-living fuck out of that game until I went back.

503
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:59,440
Speaker 1: Yes, I was basically coming home and playing Mario - every day immediately and I would you know Frickin bomb that mouse here and you couldn't save.

504
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,610
Speaker 1: so I was playing those early levels thousands of time.

505
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:09,470
Speaker 0: Yep In fact, I remember very distinctly and now that I'm talking about it I can feel it that sense of awe you would have when you're playing.

506
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:19,705
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if I can get that anymore from games but when I can't when I would play like like Mario - and Just the awe of wondering like I wonder if I can get on that ledge.

507
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:20,910
Speaker 0: I wonder if did anything over there.

508
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,198
Speaker 0: I wonder if there's anything behind that waterfall.

509
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,061
Speaker 0: I'm in a level.

510
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:25,185
Speaker 0: I've never been in before.

511
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:26,028
Speaker 0: Wow.

512
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,755
Speaker 0: That's a monster I've never seen before.

513
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:28,679
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

514
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,281
Speaker 1: Yep.

515
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:31,270
Speaker 1: That was the good stuff in those days.

516
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:39,775
Speaker 0: I can't describe the feeling but like Zelda - when I took the raft for the first time to the other half of the game Yeah, it was like whoa.

517
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:40,800
Speaker 1: This is a weird place.

518
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,169
Speaker 1: I still get it a little bit, but it's not the same.

519
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:47,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I know what's coming and even if I play new games now I don't get it.

520
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:47,697
Speaker 0: cuz.

521
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:49,350
Speaker 0: now I know a lot about games and games.

522
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:54,025
Speaker 1: See what I mostly get is the anticipation of the feeling but not the feeling itself.

523
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:58,017
Speaker 1: and then afterwards I get sort of this Disappointment like oh, it's over where to go.

524
00:37:58,037 --> 00:37:58,097
Speaker 1: Yep.

525
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:06,204
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember plus the patience I use I would literally burn Every bush on a screen in Zelda and it wouldn't bother me.

526
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:07,750
Speaker 1: I'd be like we burning bushes.

527
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:10,790
Speaker 0: Yep, because there was a chance I'd find somewhere Castlevania.

528
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:15,908
Speaker 0: I'd walk around throwing holy water in Castlevania 2 and every goddamn brick and I remember one.

529
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:26,001
Speaker 0: one day I discovered that if I had the claw equipped I could break through bricks and I found a scroll and the scroll said something Creepy about Dracula and it scared me.

530
00:38:26,022 --> 00:38:31,863
Speaker 0: and I had a nightmare about Dracula that night Because Castlevania 2 scared me more than any game.

531
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:33,210
Speaker 0: I've ever played as a human being.

532
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:35,241
Speaker 1: All right, so so enough with Nintendo.

533
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:36,689
Speaker 1: we were mad Nintendo fiends.

534
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:50,770
Speaker 0: The thing is I was an equally mad Atari fiend and right up through see I was an Atari fiend playing pac-man Combat Scott and More Atari games that I've owned.

535
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:56,990
Speaker 0: I mean I we had like 70 Atari games like 40 Nintendo games about 20 Super Nintendo games.

536
00:38:57,374 --> 00:39:08,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had maybe 30 to 40 Nintendo games and then We had like maybe 10 Atari games, but the Atari broke pretty early on so

537
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,081
Speaker 0: it was you never got to play these 7800 games like pole position -

538
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:14,896
Speaker 1: no, I played a lot of arcade games though I would go to arcades.

539
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:17,853
Speaker 1: often, you know, like all the time I'd be going to arcades.

540
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:24,110
Speaker 1: every family vacation we ever went on was basically go somewhere touristy and go to the arcades.

541
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:25,936
Speaker 0: Yep I remember Cedar Point used to have.

542
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:35,354
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still there cuz I mean we twice my family went to New Hampshire to Lake Winnipesaukee where there was fun spot the biggest Arcade in the country.

543
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:41,099
Speaker 1: and we just go to fun spot every night and get like a big fucking cup full of tokens And go Ching Ching Ching Ching.

544
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,296
Speaker 0: well Cedar Point and if they still have it I gotta find out had when I used to go this

545
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,279
Speaker 1: huge

546
00:39:46,479 --> 00:40:01,778
Speaker 0: retro arcade filled with like arcade games going back to like barely electronic games Like the oldest of old pinball and the oldest of old like shooting gallery and the oldest of old Crapple like the Star Wars game.

547
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:02,984
Speaker 1: Yeah fun spots got that.

548
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:16,649
Speaker 1: Yeah another place We always went was I think we went there twice with Sesame Place in Pennsylvania Which is the Sesame Street amusement park, which not only has awesome cargo nets of awesome But it also has this giant arcade of awesome.

549
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess the moral of all this is just that.

550
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,170
Speaker 0: I mean we've been into anime.

551
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:27,324
Speaker 0: it's pretty much I mean I've been an anime since I was in fourth grade and I've been into Dungeons & Dragons since I was in about.

552
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:31,138
Speaker 0: you know, I don't know I think it was fifth grade maybe late fourth grade.

553
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the video games since before I was sentience.

554
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:41,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I don't spend a lot of time playing video games now and they're not like my main focus.

555
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:49,930
Speaker 1: I'm like, I'm not constantly looking at the video games But it's because they I've been in them so long like since I was zero I've been video gaming.

556
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:54,510
Speaker 1: You know that it's just constantly there looming over.

557
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,824
Speaker 0: I mean I would play break when I was like.

558
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:57,810
Speaker 0: I have memories.

559
00:40:58,072 --> 00:40:59,949
Speaker 0: I must have been like three or four.

560
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:07,690
Speaker 0: I was so young because I remember when my brother was born and I remember times around that time when I would sit there playing kaboom with my dad.

561
00:41:08,252 --> 00:41:15,441
Speaker 0: Mmm video games are such a big part of my life in terms of how it shaped me as a human being even though like Scott said I don't play him so much anymore.

562
00:41:15,462 --> 00:41:16,529
Speaker 0: I just don't have time.

563
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:18,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it.

564
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:24,398
Speaker 1: you can kind of tell like it shows up in other areas Like I'll see like.

565
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:30,490
Speaker 1: right now I do spend quite a bit more time You know reading mangas and watching animes than playing video games.

566
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:39,667
Speaker 1: But if I'll go to a convention and there'll be a piece of Merchandise and like an anime I like I'd be like ooh, but then if I see a Mario it's like a Mario.

567
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:45,070
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I mean when I was playing the Castlevania DS, right?

568
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,040
Speaker 0: there's one section where it plays like original Castlevania.

569
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,649
Speaker 0: music and the graphics are all original Castlevania.

570
00:41:50,669 --> 00:42:09,046
Speaker 0: and The moment I walked into that area and I heard that music start I felt this fluttering in my chest of like the deepest nostalgia One can experience like it was on par with the nostalgia I feel like if I go back to Detroit and see my old house or Like when I meet a friend I knew in like elementary school.

571
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:11,956
Speaker 1: So basically We were crack babies.

572
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:15,346
Speaker 1: only the crack was Nintendo and Atari.

573
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:22,128
Speaker 0: and as my final bit I would like to say there is a game for the Atari 2600 called kaboom KABOOM.

574
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:23,718
Speaker 1: Now I like.

575
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,829
Speaker 1: I'm surprised you haven't said anything about bionic commando.

576
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:31,201
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, oh bionic commando is probably my favorite game ever man - please.

577
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:48,841
Speaker 0: but kaboom is a game that has such importance to me because I You know Tommy, you know from the who yeah pinball wizard Yeah, when I sit down in front of a game of kaboom.

578
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:50,687
Speaker 0: I am Tommy at that game.

579
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:54,470
Speaker 0: I Can play that game to fucking death.

580
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:56,555
Speaker 0: It's it's scary.

581
00:42:56,575 --> 00:43:07,487
Speaker 1: I don't even think about it because I've been playing this game since literally They really need to make a version of kaboom Where one guy's the mad bomber and one guy's the buckets since I mean before I was sentient.

582
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:08,410
Speaker 0: I played kaboom.

583
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:18,483
Speaker 0: I've been playing this game my entire life and When we were at our IT, I was telling everyone about this game and and they were all like, yeah Whatever you were right as a kid blah blah blah.

584
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:19,670
Speaker 0: game can't be that hard.

585
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:24,187
Speaker 0: So I pulled out the Atari and I plugged it in and I turned it on and I plugged in the.

586
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,979
Speaker 0: I have two sets Of the analog controllers because this game is analog.

587
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,930
Speaker 0: all the only control you have is one button and an analog twisty.

588
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:35,398
Speaker 0: It's a paddle and the first set of paddles.

589
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,630
Speaker 0: because of the room we were in there was too much electromagnetic interference.

590
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:41,218
Speaker 0: the thing would jump all over.

591
00:43:41,258 --> 00:43:47,110
Speaker 0: the screen said to plug in the second set and Scott sat down and let him play it and he died almost immediately.

592
00:43:47,654 --> 00:43:49,389
Speaker 0: Greg and Alex and everyone just died.

593
00:43:50,092 --> 00:44:00,745
Speaker 0: and then I sat down in front of it having not played the game for almost three years and I racked up like 2,000 points in a game where a hundred points is a big deal.

594
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's pretty good at kaboom.

595
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:04,502
Speaker 0: This game is probably the game.

596
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:05,850
Speaker 0: I'm better at than any game ever.

597
00:44:06,197 --> 00:44:17,270
Speaker 0: I love it And if I ever meet any of you in a situation where I'll have my Atari and we can play kaboom I will give a cash prize to anyone who can beat me at that game.

598
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:21,293
Speaker 1: All right, just to summarize the rest of my video game career NES.

599
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:29,732
Speaker 1: then I had a Genesis and I played SNES at all my friends houses so it evened out, you know, everyone would get the system that the other people didn't have and get the games the other people didn't have.

600
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:37,908
Speaker 1: and then after that I Started doing the PC gaming thing while my brother had an N64, but I still played a bunch of N64 stuff.

601
00:44:38,771 --> 00:44:44,110
Speaker 1: I didn't really play so much PlayStation 1 stuff and PlayStation 2 stuff and I got to college.

602
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:55,670
Speaker 1: I did PC gaming PC gaming PC gaming GameCube GameCube and You know We did Gameboy stuff also, but I didn't get the Gameboy until like the Gameboy color right now.

603
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,202
Speaker 1: My brother actually got the Gameboy pocket right now.

604
00:44:58,242 --> 00:44:59,628
Speaker 0: It seems to be DS for us most.

605
00:44:59,668 --> 00:45:01,877
Speaker 1: right now It's DS and soon it's gonna be we.

606
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:04,869
Speaker 1: the PC faded out when we started using Linux basically.

607
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:09,269
Speaker 1: Yep Well, I still do saw my PC gaming is pretty much steam steam steam steam.

608
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:22,090
Speaker 0: Well, I'll do the same little summary Scott did before we end this, you know Atari's and the Intellivisions and Nintendo and the Super Nintendo and I played the Nintendo and Super Nintendo All the way through until the very end of that era.

609
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:37,944
Speaker 0: I mean we got a Super Nintendo right when it came out and like every launch game and pretty much when the Super Nintendo died, I moved into PC gaming and I Completely abandoned console gaming from that point until the GameCube.

610
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:42,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, no PlayStation No in 64, I had no interest at all.

611
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:52,410
Speaker 0: I was a 100% PC gamer other than the fact that I continued to play my Nintendo and Super Nintendo and Continuously through that entire era until the GameCube.

612
00:45:52,732 --> 00:46:02,390
Speaker 1: Yeah from the end of the 16-bit era to the GameCube I was strictly a PC gamer except the Gameboy and then the Gameboy Advance sort of lived on in the background.

613
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:08,530
Speaker 1: You know always, you know all the way up through now the DS, you know, it's like it's like a separate track almost.

614
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,557
Speaker 1: It's just always there.

615
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:20,850
Speaker 0: See actually in terms of portable gaming I wasn't really in on that boat too much until I got a Game Gear and My brother got a Game Boy and we traded him back and forth a lot and I really wasn't big on the Game Boy.

616
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,249
Speaker 0: I like the Game Gear a lot more except that it eventually died because there weren't enough games for it.

617
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:26,350
Speaker 1: They're all crap.

618
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,010
Speaker 0: And then I got a Game Boy Advance really late.

619
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:36,026
Speaker 0: My mom bought it for me at one point and then I got hooked on Advance Wars and now I have a DS and the DS is my primary gaming console.

620
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:44,706
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean my basically like the Game Boy was something I would play at my one friend's house who had an old-school Game Boy and you know

621
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:45,901
Speaker 0: While

622
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:55,849
Speaker 1: it was cool I didn't really want one that badly because what you know the games I was playing were like Kirby's pinball which was only exciting because I played it rarely at this one kid's house.

623
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:58,186
Speaker 1: or What was the other game?

624
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,850
Speaker 1: Freaking Oh Solomon's Key, which is that puzzle game?

625
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:08,975
Speaker 1: That was impossibly hard and I knew that if I had it for myself, I would I would just kill myself Games like that.

626
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:12,110
Speaker 1: So I didn't really want a Game Boy, but I like playing at my friend's house.

627
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:19,512
Speaker 1: but then when Pokemon came out, my brother got a Game Boy Pocket and Pokemon and I was kind of like Whatever.

628
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,480
Speaker 1: That's a kitty looking Pokemon thing.

629
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:23,007
Speaker 1: And then I said, oh, wait a minute.

630
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:23,810
Speaker 1: That's worth playing.

631
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:26,222
Speaker 1: So I got the Game Boy Color and Pokemon.

632
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:28,494
Speaker 1: when the Game Boy Color came out I got it.

633
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:31,879
Speaker 1: then when the Game Boy Advance came out I got it right away.

634
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,750
Speaker 1: And then when the DS came out got it right away.

635
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:38,270
Speaker 0: Yep, Scott and I bought DS's the day they came out and and multiple games for them.

636
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:43,185
Speaker 1: So for the past three, you know game, you know, Nintendo portable systems.

637
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:44,950
Speaker 1: I've gotten them pretty much at launch.

638
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:49,290
Speaker 1: I never got the SP's or you know, the anything like that.

639
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:53,869
Speaker 1: I just got the Game Boy Color their original advance and the old original DS.

640
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:54,875
Speaker 0: I skipped all.

641
00:47:54,915 --> 00:48:00,410
Speaker 0: I went from Game Boy and Game Gear to GBA and then DS never had a Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color.

642
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got in the game late and stayed in the game.

643
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:07,348
Speaker 1: You know until today you got in the game early dropped out and came back in.

644
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:09,651
Speaker 1: Yep But other than that, I think that's it.

645
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,500
