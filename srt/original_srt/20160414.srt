1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,528
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, April 14th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:10,909
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:16,780
Speaker 0: I am Scott.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,726
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nides.

5
00:00:18,806 --> 00:00:22,420
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're recording this in the future because Rym's off somewhere doing something.

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,398
Speaker 0: You mean the past.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:23,881
Speaker 1: Yep.

8
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,369
Speaker 1: Boat times.

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,440
Speaker 1: Times on boats.

10
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:28,519
Speaker 0: I'm on a boat.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,779
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,240
Speaker 1: I actually watched that video again randomly recently because I had YouTube playing music.

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,405
Speaker 1: All these remixes.

14
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:38,529
Speaker 1: I can just let it go.

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,020
Speaker 1: YouTube was just playing its videos.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,386
Speaker 1: Just video, video, video.

17
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:43,312
Speaker 1: But I wasn't watching them.

18
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,780
Speaker 1: I was just listening to them while I was working on something.

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,794
Speaker 1: And suddenly, I'm on a boat came in and I was like,

20
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:47,955
Speaker 1: "Alright."

21
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:52,760
Speaker 1: And then I just basically listened to their entire discography after that.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,619
Speaker 1: I think my favorite song they've ever done is actually that Michael Bolton one.

23
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,358
Speaker 0: How did I know you'd pick that one?

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,584
Speaker 1: How could I not?

25
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,957
Speaker 1: When it gets to the Scarface stuff at the end, I can't help it.

26
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:04,700
Speaker 1: It's just too good.

27
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,137
Speaker 0: I think my favorite one is, "Throws you on the

28
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:08,680
Speaker 0: ground.".

29
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,262
Speaker 1: Yeah.

30
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,095
Speaker 1: Well, that's the most useful one in my day-to-day life.

31
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:14,320
Speaker 1: That one gets quoted the most.

32
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,278
Speaker 0: You can't trust the system.

33
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:19,772
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

34
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:21,920
Speaker 0: Then it's not a phone.

35
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:29,319
Speaker 1: I guess I'm at a financial conference today, so I'm not actually here right now.

36
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:34,740
Speaker 1: So that's my opening vid, and we're recording extra shows in the past for the future.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,719
Speaker 1: So you got any news?

38
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,528
Speaker 0: No, because it's two days in the past.

39
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,775
Speaker 0: I don't know what's happening on Thursday.

40
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:39,760
Speaker 0: I can't do news about you.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,611
Speaker 1: Not at all, but our news isn't supposed to be breaking news.

42
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:43,080
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to get your news from geek nights.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,104
Speaker 0: Nothing has happened.

44
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:45,210
Speaker 0: It's been so boring.

45
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,276
Speaker 0: It's cold still.

46
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,080
Speaker 0: There's your news.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,174
Speaker 1: It's warm now in the past, like warmer than it was.

48
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,460
Speaker 1: I wore sandals to work today.

49
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:52,246
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

50
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,040
Speaker 0: It's not warm enough.

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,699
Speaker 1: I wore sandals and white jeans.

52
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,678
Speaker 0: It's too cold.

53
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:57,513
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll bike to work tomorrow.

54
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:58,180
Speaker 1: Just getting up there.

55
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:58,679
Speaker 0: It's too cold.

56
00:01:58,966 --> 00:01:59,660
Speaker 1: It's not that cold.

57
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,140
Speaker 1: It's too cold.

58
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,170
Speaker 1: Not like last weekend.

59
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,020
Speaker 1: Fuck that.

60
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:03,750
Speaker 0: Fuck all this cold.

61
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,039
Speaker 0: It needs to be 80 at least.

62
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:12,800
Speaker 1: So for those of you who don't know, it got cold enough to snow last weekend in New York City, and this whole swatch.

63
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:24,460
Speaker 1: So I was at work on Thursday, and I saw someone tweet at me, and they tweeted at me this weather forecast that showed snow in New York days in the future, and I assumed they were joking.

64
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:30,342
Speaker 1: I did not believe them until later when I got a New York City advisory saying, "Yo, dawg.

65
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,875
Speaker 1: It's gonna freeze, so take your plants

66
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:33,056
Speaker 1: in.".

67
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:34,679
Speaker 0: It's too cold.

68
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,381
Speaker 1: Yeah.

69
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:36,485
Speaker 1: So I got news.

70
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:40,780
Speaker 1: This is something Scott and I talked about a bunch in our lives, but we didn't talk about it on geek nights.

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,386
Speaker 0: It's not news.

72
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,659
Speaker 0: It's the oldest story in the book.

73
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,325
Speaker 1: March 20th, 2016 is not that long ago.

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

75
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,091
Speaker 0: It's a specific instance of a thing.

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,940
Speaker 1: Name another instance where this happened in this manner.

77
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:55,863
Speaker 0: Uh...

78
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,260
Speaker 1: I can name an instance where the opposite happened.

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,320
Speaker 0: That would give away a prank that I have been pulling on you for a very long amount of time, and I would rather not give that away.

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:05,962
Speaker 1: Ah.

81
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,500
Speaker 0: So just keep it going.

82
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,327
Speaker 0: Alright.

83
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:09,340
Speaker 1: Alright.

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,380
Speaker 1: So Kraft reveals revamped mac and cheese 50 million boxes later.

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,880
Speaker 1: The story is that Kraft, for various reasons, changed the ingredients in their mac and cheese.

86
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:23,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:35,080
Speaker 1: The new formula removed artificial preservatives, swapped out artificial dyes for a combination of paprika, annatto, and turmeric under development for three years, blah, blah, blah.

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,380
Speaker 1: So basically, they changed the ingredients, and this probably didn't change the flavor.

89
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:43,119
Speaker 1: They just made the ingredients better.

90
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:54,260
Speaker 1: So it's telling that they used paprika and all this, not necessarily because of their flavor profile, but to make it look like cheese, as opposed to what I guess it would look like without those things.

91
00:03:54,841 --> 00:04:00,000
Speaker 1: I imagine Kraft mac and cheese looks hellish and inedible without food coloring in it.

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,960
Speaker 0: It looks, I mean, the way it looks when you make it is golden, right?

93
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,588
Speaker 1: If you make real mac and cheese, it doesn't look golden.

94
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:11,960
Speaker 1: It looks kind of whitish, but then it has the baking sort of like browning around the edges.

95
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:12,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,980
Speaker 1: But they did this, and they had a big problem in the company, and apparently they debated this for a while, about whether or not to tell anyone that they were going to do it.

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,942
Speaker 0: All right, so let me tell you.

98
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:31,240
Speaker 0: So I used, for many moons, right, from like when I was very young until college, or no, until Beacon days, I drank this pineapple orange juice.

99
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,811
Speaker 0: It was Dole brand, right?

100
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:36,608
Speaker 0: The one with the sun for the... Dole brand, pineapple orange juice specifically.

101
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:50,220
Speaker 0: And if you looked at the ingredients of pineapple orange juice back in the day when I drank it, the ingredients were like pineapple juice, orange juice, lemon squirt, and then a bunch of other crap like, you know, water and maybe sodium benzoate.

102
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:54,060
Speaker 1: You drank this stuff like it was of religious libation.

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:05,820
Speaker 0: This show was so good because it basically had all the power of orangey, but the pineapple cut off the sort of, you know, super orange flavor and sweetened it up.

104
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:10,900
Speaker 0: But then this lemon squirt brought back the, you know, the citrus sting that you need.

105
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,065
Speaker 0: And it's like, it would clear your throat out of any gunk.

106
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:21,880
Speaker 0: and, you know, refreshing morning feelings came in like, ah, way better than Tropicana orangey.

107
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,757
Speaker 1: That drove people to drink and prescribe vinegar if they were out of lime juice to prevent scurvy.

108
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:28,118
Speaker 1: And guess what?

109
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:28,620
Speaker 1: That doesn't work.

110
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,264
Speaker 0: That doesn't work, but it tastes great.

111
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:34,535
Speaker 0: And one cup, eight ounces of it gave you 200 percent of your daily intake, which is unnecessary.

112
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,779
Speaker 1: But it still tasted good.

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,108
Speaker 1: In old geek nights, we used to talk about orange juice a lot.

114
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:44,160
Speaker 1: Like, I don't think you guys understand how important orange juice was to our day to day lives.

115
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:52,300
Speaker 0: So anyway, at some point when we were in Beacon, they changed the formula and it said on the carton like new, improved formula, whatever.

116
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:58,960
Speaker 0: And the difference here is that not only was it new, improved formula, but they drastically changed the flavor.

117
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,774
Speaker 0: The ingredient, number one ingredient, if you buy the stuff today, is apple juice.

118
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,420
Speaker 0: And it tastes mostly like apple juice.

119
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,828
Speaker 0: That squirt of lemon isn't even in there anymore.

120
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,520
Speaker 0: I don't know how much pineapple and orange there is, but not much.

121
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:13,360
Speaker 0: So at that point, I pretty much abandoned it and drank other juices.

122
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:22,380
Speaker 0: And I've tried to replicate that juice, you know, like just by taking oranges, pineapples, and lemon and combining them and it doesn't quite taste the same.

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Speaker 0: Now, it tastes better sometimes because it's mad fresh, but it doesn't taste the same.

124
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,740
Speaker 0: So, but the thing is they, A, actually changed the flavor and B, told you.

125
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,885
Speaker 0: Here, they didn't change the flavor.

126
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,150
Speaker 0: They just changed the ingredients and they didn't tell you.

127
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:43,439
Speaker 0: because if they told you, but they didn't, you know, actually change the flavor, you'd still believe that it tasted different when it didn't.

128
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,320
Speaker 1: See, there's a third element to this, a third direction.

129
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,840
Speaker 0: And sales might go down and people start buying bunny brand instead.

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:59,340
Speaker 1: When this, I mean, it's interesting how this is something that's largely forgotten among young people, but we, you know, Coke, Coca-Cola changed and became New Coke.

131
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 1: And they changed the flavor and they told everyone about it.

132
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:10,700
Speaker 1: Now, in that case, all the research they had done showed that people overwhelmingly preferred the new flavor.

133
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:13,460
Speaker 0: In a blind test, people preferred the new flavor.

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,840
Speaker 1: They would always say the new flavor was abjectly superior.

135
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:24,959
Speaker 1: And yet, when they told the public, "Hey, you all, we proved scientifically that you all love this new flavor, so this is the new flavor of

136
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:25,240
Speaker 1: Coke.".

137
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:29,209
Speaker 1: And people went crazy, boycotted it, disaster.

138
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:34,380
Speaker 1: This was, like, one of the biggest corporate disasters in, like, consumer product history.

139
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,150
Speaker 1: To the point that they actually went back to classic Coke.

140
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,300
Speaker 1: That's why Coca-Cola today will be like classic Coca-Cola.

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,192
Speaker 0: Every time you ask a question, like, "Why does company do something so stupidly?

142
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:46,516
Speaker 0: They could do it so much better.

143
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,539
Speaker 0: Why don't they do it so much

144
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:47,820
Speaker 0: better?".

145
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,380
Speaker 0: It's because most people on Earth are morons.

146
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,320
Speaker 1: Living in the dark, blindly feeling their way through things.

147
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,146
Speaker 0: And they just, they hate change.

148
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,737
Speaker 0: No matter what the change is, change is the enemy, right?

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,169
Speaker 0: The status quo is the friend.

150
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,320
Speaker 0: So, you can't change anything.

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:12,379
Speaker 0: So, Kraft did the smart thing, which is, "Yes, change it for the better, and don't tell anyone, because then the morons will stop buying

152
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:12,480
Speaker 0: it.".

153
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:19,218
Speaker 0: If they would have just started putting that better Coke in the Coke cans without saying anything, even then- People would have been like, "Whoa, this Coke feels really good, ah,

154
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:19,379
Speaker 0: ugh.".

155
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,862
Speaker 0: Yeah.

156
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:24,640
Speaker 0: I don't know why they don't do that now, especially, you know, but whatever.

157
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:38,700
Speaker 1: So, basically, if you read this article, because I'm not, you know, you can read the article, I'm not just going to summarize it all for you, but what Kraft did is they changed it, they changed it, and they kept it a desperate secret for a long time.

158
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,099
Speaker 1: Until they were confident that people had been eating the new one for a long time.

159
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:51,520
Speaker 1: No one noticed at all, and then they announced, "Hey, we've got a new Kraft whatever, and guess what?

160
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:55,120
Speaker 1: We already sold over 50 million boxes, and you've been eating it-".

161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,908
Speaker 0: But they didn't make, like, a huge announcement.

162
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,375
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're TV commercials.

163
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:00,799
Speaker 0: I think the announcement was just like- They did a new ad campaign.

164
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,459
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

165
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:08,280
Speaker 1: After it was out there for a long time, saying, "It changed, but it hasn't, because none of you noticed.

166
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:13,195
Speaker 1: It's the same thing you've always had, but we did change it, so eat a

167
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:13,496
Speaker 1: dick.".

168
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:19,240
Speaker 0: They didn't have to say anything ever, they could have just kept doing what they were doing.

169
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:43,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the story is just an interesting sort of, even if you know there is a smart, right thing to do, or you know an answer to a question, if you interact with the mass market, you sometimes have to do very counterintuitive things, or hide information from people that is not relevant to them, because otherwise they will make very poor, ill-informed decisions based on things that they literally made up.

170
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,963
Speaker 0: You don't need to know that.

171
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:51,907
Speaker 0: What you need to know is that if you're the kind of moron who opposes something simply because it's changed, you're the problem in this world, fuck you.

172
00:09:51,927 --> 00:10:01,820
Speaker 0: If you're the kind of person who, when you hear that something is now changed and improved, and that makes you excited, and you want to go seek it out, you are the good person who is the savior of this world.

173
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:14,680
Speaker 1: Now I wonder if the fact that you had such difficulty in those early days, because you guys don't understand, Scott was like experimenting with different mixes of the three juices for weeks when he lost his recipe, like trying to recreate it.

174
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,639
Speaker 0: If they hadn't said anything- I sent them a letter and they didn't help me out.

175
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:23,080
Speaker 1: If they hadn't said anything, would you have noticed?

176
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,093
Speaker 0: Would I have noticed, right?

177
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:29,606
Speaker 0: Well it is- Because maybe the reason- It is a very significantly different flavor, right?

178
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:38,400
Speaker 0: It's like I actually, if I recall correctly, I bought it and drank it and then said, "This tastes different," and then noticed the thing on the carton afterwards.

179
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,120
Speaker 1: But is it possible that the reason, because there's only three ingredients, like there's not that many options for your dosage here.

180
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:53,140
Speaker 1: Is it possible that the reason you can't recreate that flavor is that that flavor existed solely in the nostalgia post-change?

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Speaker 1: Your brain created an ideal that cannot be attained.

182
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,391
Speaker 0: The only thing I have to reference the flavor now is my memory.

183
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,520
Speaker 0: I don't even have a sample, so I can't know.

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,480
Speaker 1: So you might have mythologized the memory of that flavor.

185
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:12,680
Speaker 0: But the original change happened at a period where I had a container of the old stuff and a container of the new stuff in the fridge at the same time.

186
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,579
Speaker 0: I polished off the old one and the next day I went for the new one, and I said, "Whoa, what's going on

187
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:17,740
Speaker 0: here?".

188
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:25,260
Speaker 0: There are times where, for example, one time I went to Grand Central to the Hot N' Crusty, which is closed by the way.

189
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:27,889
Speaker 1: I'm real sad about that.

190
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:28,895
Speaker 1: I haven't fully grokked it yet.

191
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,331
Speaker 0: I bought the one serving orange juice and I started to drink it and I went, "Ah!

192
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,818
Speaker 0: What is wrong with this one serving orange juice?

193
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:36,059
Speaker 0: Is it

194
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:36,380
Speaker 0: bad?".

195
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:41,994
Speaker 0: And I looked at it and I had accidentally purchased grapefruit orangy, and I can't take grapefruit.

196
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,500
Speaker 0: It's too acid-y and it's no good.

197
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:52,340
Speaker 0: And so even though my brain was thinking the whole time, "This is orangey," and didn't suspect any, you know, I just thought it was orangey.

198
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,207
Speaker 0: I didn't, you know, but my tongue did not lie.

199
00:11:56,307 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 0: So there is an extent to which you can change something to where the senses will still detect change regardless of psychology.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,035
Speaker 1: True, true.

201
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,579
Speaker 0: You can't put battery acid in the milk container to have someone drink it and go,

202
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:08,780
Speaker 0: "Ah!"

203
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,043
Speaker 0: Milk!

204
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:10,039
Speaker 1: Not with Benjamin R!

205
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:10,960
Speaker 0: Right.

206
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,237
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

207
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:20,720
Speaker 1: What do you got?

208
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,479
Speaker 0: It was another link that I sent you.

209
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,418
Speaker 1: You don't remember this too?

210
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,260
Speaker 0: I have to click on it to remember it.

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,599
Speaker 1: Alright, so I can do mine first.

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:38,180
Speaker 1: So, as you know, one of the things that I hate and am displeased by more than anything else in the world is bike thieves.

213
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,545
Speaker 1: I've had my bike stolen multiple times.

214
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,491
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people have their bikes stolen.

215
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,780
Speaker 1: New York City is the bike stealingest place in America.

216
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,939
Speaker 1: It's a problem for a lot of reasons.

217
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:59,519
Speaker 1: And this is a video, purportedly, now I do not, I mean, it looks pretty legit, and I was going through this guy's channel, and I am not making a claim that everything in this channel is 100% legit.

218
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:10,780
Speaker 1: But, "Stun gun in bike seat, prank in the hood, electric bait bike prank, karma, social experiment" is the video.

219
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:20,420
Speaker 1: And the video is basically, he has a stun gun rigged with a cell phone hidden in a bike, and the stun gun is right where your balls are in a bike seat.

220
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,060
Speaker 1: So, he can call a number, and the stun gun just starts going.

221
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,798
Speaker 0: What the fuck is going on?

222
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:38,120
Speaker 1: And then the video is just leaving the bike unlocked in bad neighborhoods, waiting for someone to eventually steal it, and then calling the number and watching them get their balls shot.

223
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Speaker 1: It is extremely cathartic to watch this video, and while I'm not necessarily a fan of vigilante justice, I'm not that opposed to this level of entrapment.

224
00:13:51,260 --> 00:14:03,860
Speaker 1: The level of, here is an easy crime that would harm a person if it was a real crime, but it's actually a trap that will not kill them, it's not like there's a shotgun in the bike seat, but will cause them significant discomfort.

225
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:12,439
Speaker 1: So, while I enjoyed this, there's another video in the channel that I saw right after that, that I have to call attention to.

226
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:20,860
Speaker 1: Car Bomb Bait Car Prank in the Hood, Public Bomb Scare Prank, Instant Karma, Best Pranks.

227
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:33,080
Speaker 1: This guy has this fucking rigged up, fake looking, like a bomb, like three sticks of dynamite, and a really long set of, you know those fuses you buy if you make your own fireworks?

228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:58,141
Speaker 1: Like the ones that go real slow and real big like pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss ssss.

229
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,978
Speaker 1: car and driving it around at people which is funny in its own.

230
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:09,857
Speaker 1: I mean obviously a little mean but just the idea of that is kind of funny to me.

231
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,002
Speaker 0: use it in a crowd.

232
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,353
Speaker 0: let me get on the roller coaster next.

233
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:16,657
Speaker 0: swerve gentlemen.

234
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:25,208
Speaker 1: but basically the what the gist of this video is purportedly and the video is pretty funny is he Lee.

235
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:50,656
Speaker 1: he parks a beater car in a bad neighborhood with the window down in the door and locked and there's some valuables laying around in the car and in the backseat is just this fake fucking bomb to sit in there and he waits for someone to sit down in the car because a car thief will just steal the car but it's a thief of opportunity will not like stand around outside the car like people who regularly steal from unlocked cars.

236
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:51,682
Speaker 1: they know what they're doing.

237
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:55,726
Speaker 1: if you see an unlocked car you open the door and you sit down in it and close the door.

238
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,279
Speaker 1: that way you're in the car.

239
00:15:57,601 --> 00:16:00,175
Speaker 1: unless someone walks up to the car is the owner of the car.

240
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,678
Speaker 1: they're not going to think anything wrong with someone sitting in a car.

241
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,040
Speaker 0: so now I think this person knows a lot about bike stealing and cars.

242
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,818
Speaker 0: yeah it's not a high quality prison.

243
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,990
Speaker 1: well they're all they're they're they're.

244
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,860
Speaker 1: they're regular modern-day Batman.

245
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:13,583
Speaker 1: yeah.

246
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:23,339
Speaker 1: so the way this works is that after they sit in the car and there's cameras like rigged up in the car everywhere wait a few minutes or a few seconds and then trigger this.

247
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:31,719
Speaker 1: so the person turns around and usually some variation of what the fuck holy fuck followed by like running out of the car screaming dropping stuff.

248
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:32,402
Speaker 1: it's pretty great.

249
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,791
Speaker 1: but he went one step further.

250
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:39,178
Speaker 1: the car is rigged so that the handle on the inside of the car will not work.

251
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,939
Speaker 1: hmm so they have to jump out the window.

252
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,647
Speaker 1: so I invite you to enjoy these videos.

253
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:52,394
Speaker 0: so this guy someone I guess who follows this YouTube channel this is big Clive dot-com.

254
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,359
Speaker 0: what's up big Clive?

255
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,169
Speaker 0: somebody found a USB charger similar to the ones we get from anchor that let you charge five USB devices.

256
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,417
Speaker 1: I'm holding one of my hands right now.

257
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,313
Speaker 1: this one charges six.

258
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,383
Speaker 0: whoa daddy.

259
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,390
Speaker 0: yeah anyway I want to work.

260
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:11,265
Speaker 0: that is 10. so but this is like some off-brand crappy one.

261
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:19,134
Speaker 0: and someone bought this somewhere and when they went to use it they noticed like huh this shocked me when I tried to use it.

262
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:19,476
Speaker 0: it's like.

263
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,160
Speaker 0: well that can happen.

264
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,537
Speaker 0: no it shocked me like my muscles were like contracting whoa.

265
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,550
Speaker 0: this shocked me like when I put the wire near something.

266
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,757
Speaker 0: there were sparks like when rim was in that cage.

267
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:41,770
Speaker 1: oh yeah when I tell when I touch when I grabbed the door to the server cage to open it and then I stopped because I thought an earthquake was happening and it took me a while to realize that I was being shocked.

268
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:44,223
Speaker 1: with one phase of a 220 line.

269
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,753
Speaker 0: so big Clive knows about electronics.

270
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:49,893
Speaker 0: so they sent this to big Clive and he made this video examining this USB charger.

271
00:17:49,913 --> 00:18:01,163
Speaker 0: and apparently you know when you make an electronic device that say plugs into the wall you know you have AC power coming from the wall right yep and mains love power deadly power deadly power.

272
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:05,302
Speaker 0: but on the other side you've got USB which is like a handful of volts.

273
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:09,320
Speaker 1: but if you make a shitty device I mean it's just wires right the wire.

274
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,131
Speaker 1: from all searches the wire that's on the USB

275
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:37,759
Speaker 0: on the circuit board they'll always be sort of this divide between the part that uses the PI powered electricity and the part that uses like the low power DC with the transformer in between in a big gap so that there isn't any short circuits of electricity jumping across and apparently in this USB charger that gap was not sufficient you know and big Clive goes to investigate exactly what's wrong here.

276
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,339
Speaker 1: the moral is don't buy dodgy imported like Chinese nonsense USB chargers.

277
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,305
Speaker 1: they might actually kill you.

278
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:48,956
Speaker 0: yeah this video though the problem with it is is like 28 minutes and 20 seconds long my kind of video fast forward.

279
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:53,499
Speaker 0: most of this because it's mostly him trying to like break the case open for like five minutes.

280
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,736
Speaker 1: so there's a channel I follow that isn't like I didn't live editing.

281
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:06,914
Speaker 1: there's a channel I follow that's edited better than that but it's basically just this guy tearing apart shitty imported Chinese electronics and showing how dangerous it is and they're really long videos.

282
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,383
Speaker 1: but he really goes into that detail.

283
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:10,497
Speaker 1: that's the guy who showed me about those shower heads.

284
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:11,944
Speaker 1: that will shock you if you get close to them.

285
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:24,822
Speaker 1: but yeah there was a story actually a few months ago of a woman I think was in the UK who was killed by an iPhone charger because she had headphones plugged in and this thing just mains line and killed her straight up.

286
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:31,884
Speaker 1: hmm so uh yeah don't buy cheap USB chargers guys by it when it comes to electricity.

287
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,360
Speaker 1: at least anchor anchors the minimum for a USB charger.

288
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:37,608
Speaker 0: get the name-brand biz.

289
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:44,458
Speaker 1: yeah Sorni magnet box mmm asinonic if you can't tell I've been watching a lot of Simpsons lately.

290
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,085
Speaker 1: yeah in the minute moment.

291
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:51,794
Speaker 1: next weekend we're gonna be at PAX East 2016. we're doing a panel on Sunday at 3 30 Atari game design.

292
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,528
Speaker 1: we're gonna be there Thursday playing games in the awesome tabletop area.

293
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,035
Speaker 1: their megathon is off the hook.

294
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,785
Speaker 1: the book of the book is Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood pretty much done with Wheel of Time temporarily.

295
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,594
Speaker 1: so I'll actually read that book.

296
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:09,414
Speaker 1: probably start it like right around packs times mm-hmm.

297
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,701
Speaker 1: otherwise the patreon hit its first goal the gig.

298
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:12,465
Speaker 1: nice patreon.

299
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,595
Speaker 0: so I am you can all stop giving.

300
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:15,660
Speaker 0: now you hit your stupid goal.

301
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,787
Speaker 0: I know there's another girl.

302
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:17,653
Speaker 0: you don't need that goal.

303
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:22,263
Speaker 1: if you hit the next goal I'm gonna make videos detailing the full gig nights process like all the filters I use.

304
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:25,618
Speaker 1: go back to zero all the all the everything no one.

305
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,482
Speaker 1: you get the next goal.

306
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,659
Speaker 1: after that we're gonna live stream every episode of gig night.

307
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,610
Speaker 1: you don't need to just go back to zero.

308
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,334
Speaker 1: let me fun stuff.

309
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:33,420
Speaker 0: you can go back to zero now.

310
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,286
Speaker 0: you got your beta episode.

311
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:35,898
Speaker 1: we're also stepping up the rimily review.

312
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:38,978
Speaker 1: so Emily and I are gonna be reviewing a few things in the coming weeks.

313
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:48,668
Speaker 1: you don't need that either and I'm re-releasing all eight or possibly nine pre publication beta episodes of geek guides with commentary remastered in the patreon over the next few weeks.

314
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:50,379
Speaker 0: you got what you wanted so you can cancel that.

315
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,390
Speaker 1: nope now there's gonna be so much more.

316
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:56,796
Speaker 1: the more the higher it goes the more I'm ramping up the shit and you don't need any that guy gonna be amazing.

317
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:59,669
Speaker 0: no your life will be much better off without that stuff in fact.

318
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:05,038
Speaker 1: so I've never been on like a Princess cruise or a Carnival cruise or anything like that.

319
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:14,992
Speaker 1: and while several people in our lives have tried to convince me that they're worthwhile I am highly dubious of that kind of boat time.

320
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,575
Speaker 1: hmm I mean it.

321
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:24,963
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell those cruises are pretty much just hotels turned sideways that you can't leave easily.

322
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:30,320
Speaker 1: yeah with that move with buffets and norovirus and you can't.

323
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:34,538
Speaker 0: but they provide you with much food and you know you go to a hotel.

324
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:37,717
Speaker 0: usually you don't like go in the pool but when you go to that hotel you can't.

325
00:21:37,758 --> 00:21:39,969
Speaker 0: you can't leave and go to attractions near the hotel.

326
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,487
Speaker 0: you do all the in hotel stuff like spas and pools and shit.

327
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:53,974
Speaker 1: now my suspicions were concerts and parties and whatever by other people I know who work on cruises who were like yeah it's mostly just old and or fat people but it was double can.

328
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:59,491
Speaker 1: he's in there the last time I was in Sydney and I think I talked about the same geek guys I was the basic folk I was running.

329
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:08,312
Speaker 1: I was doing a long run like all around like the opera house area and a big cruise ship was getting ready to depart so the people who were going on the cruise were all showing up.

330
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:11,404
Speaker 0: let me guess you're gonna talk about how old and fat they were.

331
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:13,671
Speaker 1: they were so old.

332
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:14,815
Speaker 0: how how were they?

333
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:19,515
Speaker 1: it was like I would say the people who were cuz it was weird.

334
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,480
Speaker 1: the staging area one.

335
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:28,340
Speaker 1: there was a giant line of people who were I guess standing in line to use the elevator to go up because they didn't want to walk up the stairs and up there.

336
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,169
Speaker 1: there was like a restaurant.

337
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,320
Speaker 1: there was a little like you could check your bags.

338
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,430
Speaker 1: there was a lounge and a bunch of bars.

339
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:39,918
Speaker 1: I think there was a hotel even like people were staying there for a few days before they even got on the cruise ship

340
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,300
Speaker 0: regaven

341
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:51,108
Speaker 1: and 95% of the people appeared to be either or both these are not mutually exclusive over the age of 70 maybe 65 maybe 65 and over 300 pounds.

342
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:57,426
Speaker 1: it was amazing to behold.

343
00:22:57,948 --> 00:23:14,103
Speaker 1: and while the argument that has been made to me by many people is that the beauty of a cruise is that if you go with like a lot of your friends like 20 or 30 for like really close friends then it's like those college days where you're basically in this hotel floating with pools and all the nonsense.

344
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:22,645
Speaker 1: other people are taking care of everything for you and you basically just hang out with your friends on a pleasure cruise and ignore all the other people.

345
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,865
Speaker 0: but couldn't you do that in a place that doesn't have all those other people to begin with?

346
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,597
Speaker 1: or couldn't you just do that in say Vegas?

347
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:38,765
Speaker 1: I decided that if because I went to Vegas with Emily not that long ago for a wedding if you're gonna do that just go to fucking Disney World or Vegas and you get all those.

348
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:42,544
Speaker 1: say all the things that people say you can get from a cruise like that.

349
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:43,387
Speaker 0: Vegas is warm.

350
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:44,691
Speaker 1: yeah Vegas is warm.

351
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:48,044
Speaker 1: if shit sucks you can just go to a different hotel.

352
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:51,620
Speaker 1: it's not like you're stuck on one hotel in Vegas the whole time.

353
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,577
Speaker 0: You can get a flight to anywhere on earth yep and it's otherwise.

354
00:23:56,598 --> 00:24:01,965
Speaker 1: it's like it's all the accoutrement of a cruise without having to be stuck on a boat full of norovirus mm-hmm.

355
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:04,635
Speaker 1: so have you ever had a boat time you ever been on a boat?

356
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,873
Speaker 0: I've never been on a biggest boat like that.

357
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,361
Speaker 1: I've never been on a cruise ship like that.

358
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:10,686
Speaker 0: I've been on all right.

359
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:11,971
Speaker 1: what's the biggest boat you've ever been on?

360
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,646
Speaker 0: I went on like this tiny cruise.

361
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,376
Speaker 0: it was like we were in high school.

362
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:25,000
Speaker 0: we went on a trip to DC and then part of the trip to DC was at one night we had dinner on this boat.

363
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,195
Speaker 0: so we got on the boat and we ate dinner and so it had.

364
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:37,856
Speaker 0: it basically was like a boat that you would get like you know to have like a wedding on or something only you know right and in like the main area is like a ballroom.

365
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:42,701
Speaker 0: yep yep and then it goes out and then you and then you go up on deck and it basically went up and down.

366
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:45,197
Speaker 0: you know this the river that's outside the National Harbor right?

367
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,476
Speaker 0: yeah yeah basically went up and down that river and then we got.

368
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:49,849
Speaker 1: well didn't we do the same that you came with when we saw was joco.

369
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:53,085
Speaker 0: this was bigger than that boat but same kind of.

370
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:53,830
Speaker 1: but yeah we did that.

371
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:01,675
Speaker 1: the mini joco crews were basically we just got on a boat with a bunch of cool people and there was a concert and drinks and hanging out on a boat going up and down the yeah

372
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:08,321
Speaker 0: imagine like that same exact deal only all high school kids and boat was two or three times as big.

373
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:14,897
Speaker 1: I actually did stuff like that a lot when I was younger but I grew up in Michigan where there actually is a significant boat culture.

374
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,996
Speaker 1: like there's a lot of canals and places where people to zone boats like.

375
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:30,478
Speaker 1: they'll have a boat in their backyard and the canal just like goes behind all the houses in the subdivision and everyone has a boat parked in their boat parking lot behind their house and they can take the canals and get out to the lakes and stuff.

376
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,623
Speaker 0: I mean it's summer camp.

377
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:34,735
Speaker 0: I did a lot of rowboat canoe kayak.

378
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:38,872
Speaker 0: I never did anything with a sail on it cuz I no one taught me how.

379
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:49,659
Speaker 1: but I guess it's interesting that like here and I've been on really big boats that were just docked like you know oh like in South Street seaport like the pirate ship kind of things.

380
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,051
Speaker 0: well I mean like like in Groton Connecticut like I went on.

381
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:53,880
Speaker 0: you know giant submarine.

382
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,145
Speaker 0: it was just there right.

383
00:25:55,206 --> 00:26:00,977
Speaker 1: but living here like the only boats I'll go on in New York City are like that joco thing where they're like there's a lot.

384
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:02,465
Speaker 1: there's a common event.

385
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:05,056
Speaker 0: people will do wherever you go in the circle line.

386
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:06,000
Speaker 0: yeah it's also.

387
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,976
Speaker 0: there's also some restaurants that are just docked boats that don't move.

388
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:13,180
Speaker 1: but like people will rent a boat and do an event and you pay money to do that event.

389
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,873
Speaker 1: or you're a rich person and you own a boat.

390
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:20,254
Speaker 0: I think I've been on like a slow riverboat that might have been Disney World or was it somewhere else.

391
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,181
Speaker 0: you know the kind with the thing in the back that goes chicka chicka chicka like a paddle boat.

392
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,408
Speaker 1: no a paddle boat.

393
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:27,997
Speaker 0: no like the Mississippi River style.

394
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:28,921
Speaker 1: yeah a paddle boat.

395
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:31,071
Speaker 0: you're not paddling like you know.

396
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,683
Speaker 1: Oh Scott that's called a paddle boat paddle wheel.

397
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:34,688
Speaker 0: they called a riverboat.

398
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,859
Speaker 0: it's just like a giant mill in the back.

399
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,873
Speaker 1: pedal boats have the pedal wheels on the back.

400
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:40,878
Speaker 0: oh not like that.

401
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:41,561
Speaker 1: yeah not like that.

402
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:44,055
Speaker 1: you're thinking the one with the one giant wheel like a maverick.

403
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,482
Speaker 0: yes yeah like that one.

404
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:56,988
Speaker 1: so but what I was getting at is that here probably like boats are a rich person thing or a bunch of people get together and basically rent a boat and charge admission to cover the rental of the boat.

405
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:03,191
Speaker 1: but where I grew up boats were like a lower middle class middle class thing.

406
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:07,692
Speaker 1: like a lot of people I knew own boats well I use them regularly.

407
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:08,959
Speaker 0: well see it's all Japan right.

408
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:14,686
Speaker 0: so if you live in a place where there's a lot of bodies of water it's cheaper to live near the body of water.

409
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:18,004
Speaker 0: you can get all kinds of you know getting an actual boat is kind of cheap.

410
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:28,763
Speaker 1: maintaining a boat is what's really expensive yeah but if your house only cost a hundred grand and it has five bedrooms and it happens to be on the water like you can afford to buy a boat and spend all that like your boat money and mate.

411
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:29,085
Speaker 0: right.

412
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:37,750
Speaker 0: but if you less than guys in a suburb that's not near any kind of lake or anything or any large body of water having a boat is only you know something a rich person you do.

413
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:42,852
Speaker 1: yep but if you live in New York you can't afford to live here and have a boat.

414
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,670
Speaker 0: unless you're so rich you can afford to live here and have a boat.

415
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:59,442
Speaker 1: so it's interesting that perspective because where I grew up like so many of my friends had boats that a common thing I would do in high school is one of my friends be like hey we're gonna have a party on the boat and a bunch of us teenagers would just get on a pretty big boat.

416
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:08,044
Speaker 1: and the one slightly wealthier friend who either had permission from his parents or scammed like 30 bucks out of all of us so he could afford to like refill the tanks.

417
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:10,054
Speaker 1: they wouldn't notice that we took the boat out.

418
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:19,036
Speaker 1: then we just take the boat out to like the mid like we go way out into one of the Great Lakes and just hang out on a boat in the middle of the night on a boat.

419
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:21,851
Speaker 1: yeah and those are some of my best high school times.

420
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,139
Speaker 1: there's something about like.

421
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:33,506
Speaker 1: I've always enjoyed that sitting in a boat in the middle of the water way out at night where there's all black around you you see like cargo ships way off in the distance and you see the shore.

422
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:37,662
Speaker 1: they come and smash in you but don't go into the shipping lane.

423
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,446
Speaker 1: the fuck's wrong with you.

424
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:43,530
Speaker 1: at least everyone who took the boats out knew what they were doing with the boats.

425
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:45,339
Speaker 1: I never went out with the people who.

426
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,687
Speaker 0: that's the thing with a car?

427
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:54,296
Speaker 0: you know even though you look around this country right and people are driving everywhere in the world people are driving everywhere and they can't drive for shit but they do it anyway.

428
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,728
Speaker 0: yeah it's they manage to get by even though they suck.

429
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,600
Speaker 0: with a boat you can't get by if you suck.

430
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:14,022
Speaker 0: also there's a lot more to know than there is to know like if the boats already out out of the docks you can get by knowing nothing pretty easily unless there's any unless there's even some even the slightest thing out of the ordinary.

431
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:18,933
Speaker 0: if you just have to make the boat go and change its direction and it has a steering wheel you can get by.

432
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,876
Speaker 1: yeah because you'll turn the steering wheel and fuck it up and you'll go way off course but there's nothing to hit.

433
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 0: right.

434
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:32,236
Speaker 0: but as soon as you get into a situation of any kind like there's something not exactly 100% right with the boat dead you're just dead right.

435
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:33,221
Speaker 0: yeah everyone's dead.

436
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:38,604
Speaker 0: you know the boat is having a trouble or you know the boat is leaning one way.

437
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:40,774
Speaker 0: you know there's someone coming near you.

438
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:44,775
Speaker 1: it's like well I'll put it this way like we talked about how everyone's a shitty drive there's a fish.

439
00:29:45,177 --> 00:29:48,917
Speaker 1: most people who drive cars cannot parallel park at all like they can't do it.

440
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,375
Speaker 0: well most places you don't have to do it so they don't learn how.

441
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,080
Speaker 0: they don't make anyone.

442
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:59,998
Speaker 1: so actually taking a moderate sized boat and getting it back into the dock without fucking everything up is about like parallel parking.

443
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:02,752
Speaker 1: you got to know what you're doing and if you like use boats at all.

444
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:03,817
Speaker 1: it's real easy.

445
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,447
Speaker 0: you don't want to crash into the dock.

446
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:08,847
Speaker 0: yeah you don't want to miss the dock and be too far away to tie up to it.

447
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:16,304
Speaker 1: mostly there's not a lot of space in there and there's a lot of other boats around to navigate and also the steering of a boat out in the middle of the water.

448
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:19,885
Speaker 1: it's real easy because if you're way off it doesn't really matter that much.

449
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:23,628
Speaker 0: but when you have to maneuver it the precision needs to be so tight it's so you've got.

450
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:25,659
Speaker 0: the water is also affecting your boat.

451
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,932
Speaker 0: it's not like a car where nothing affects its movement.

452
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:28,898
Speaker 0: it's just sitting still.

453
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:34,329
Speaker 0: the boat will move on its own if you just don't do anything yeah and also things like you're going forward in a pretty good clip.

454
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,743
Speaker 1: right there's no break on the boat it's not like.

455
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,238
Speaker 1: well I'm gonna stop now folks gonna keep going forward.

456
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:44,263
Speaker 1: you start to turn to the left you're gonna start spinning while you're still moving forward.

457
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:54,354
Speaker 1: yep and I've watched a lot of people fuck their small boats up because they don't actually know how to maneuver it in close quarters or they vastly underestimate their speed and just don't know about boats.

458
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:54,957
Speaker 1: mm-hmm.

459
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,743
Speaker 1: so but it was.

460
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:59,919
Speaker 1: but again I grew up in a place where everyone knew about boats.

461
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:02,895
Speaker 0: so we're boat people and you hang out on boats and some lakes there.

462
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:11,667
Speaker 1: I actually do wish that boating was more accessible financially in the New York area because there's a lot of water here.

463
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,046
Speaker 0: I would really I don't touch the water but I wouldn't mind being in a boat.

464
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,320
Speaker 1: I don't really enjoy taking a boat out with like.

465
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:22,166
Speaker 0: say like you me Emily I see some boats going down the river and man those are some fancy fucking boats.

466
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:26,993
Speaker 0: I saw a boat that was basically like evil Bondville in the boat and I'm like damn I should just hijack that motherfucker.

467
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:35,523
Speaker 1: like imagine on a nice night with the fireworks right we go out and we just like do a long leisurely circle out like seeing New York in the distance the fireworks in the distance.

468
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,559
Speaker 0: I don't think they'll let you boat when the fireworks are there.

469
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,296
Speaker 1: well not right where the barges are but you go off a ways and you can but imagine like that like hanging out like I'm driving the boat.

470
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:47,066
Speaker 0: you guys are all rent a boat then big money man.

471
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:49,152
Speaker 1: no that much money.

472
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:54,110
Speaker 1: a one-night rental one-night rental of a big boat is actually not that cheap.

473
00:31:54,271 --> 00:32:00,925
Speaker 1: and I am NOT going to say that my boating skills are adequate to this area because I mean first of all we know people's boating skills.

474
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:04,101
Speaker 0: and two you can always rent someone to go with the boat.

475
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:06,898
Speaker 1: yeah the right way to go is to rent the kind of boat that did.

476
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:09,487
Speaker 1: like that Hall & Oates thing we went to on Judith's bachelor party.

477
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:14,946
Speaker 1: mm-hmm you it was a real funny boat time.

478
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:23,054
Speaker 1: so it was the same kind of boat as the joke of thing and it was a Hall & Oates tribute band okay which I'm into.

479
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:31,073
Speaker 1: okay there was another boat that was bigger that was filling up next to us and there was something else going on that looked way better on that boat.

480
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,024
Speaker 1: but there was a weird sort of aside.

481
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:36,121
Speaker 1: there was a stark dichotomy between the people getting on the boat.

482
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:42,564
Speaker 1: the Hall & Oates tribute band boat was basically all yuppie hipster looking white people.

483
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:44,872
Speaker 1: the other boat was all cool people.

484
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:51,705
Speaker 1: hmm that other boat like whatever party was happening on that boat looked amazing and that boat went off into the sunset.

485
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,675
Speaker 1: I heard the music coming from that boat.

486
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:55,142
Speaker 1: that's the boat I should have been on.

487
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:56,426
Speaker 0: why didn't you get on the cool boat?

488
00:32:56,446 --> 00:33:01,894
Speaker 1: I would had to jump and swim for it and I don't know if they would let me up.

489
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,242
Speaker 0: you couldn't do good weren't close enough.

490
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,125
Speaker 0: you couldn't jump and grab.

491
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:04,768
Speaker 0: it was too late.

492
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:13,356
Speaker 1: the boat was action but the Hall & Oates boat went up and down the East River and no one went to see the Hall & Oates.

493
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:14,603
Speaker 1: we all just hung out on the deck.

494
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:23,631
Speaker 1: because that feeling of being on a boat with the shore in the distance looking up at the sky the fresh breeze drinking something hanging out with friends good times smells like water.

495
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:26,762
Speaker 0: yep I really enjoy smells like East River.

496
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:29,572
Speaker 1: it smelled okay actually for some reason.

497
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:41,123
Speaker 1: wind blowing the right direction yeah something blowing the wrong direction you know in that Jersey air coming back across yeah what all little boats yeah ever go like kayaking.

498
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:42,469
Speaker 0: I talked about summer camp.

499
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:47,409
Speaker 0: you know every summer camp has a tiny lake and that always has you know like a kayak.

500
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,242
Speaker 1: yeah a rowboat you know what I always enjoy.

501
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:51,910
Speaker 1: a lot of kids we talk about skill.

502
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,761
Speaker 1: kids fucking don't know how to use canoes.

503
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,471
Speaker 0: windsurfing I know how to use a canoe.

504
00:33:55,511 --> 00:34:01,204
Speaker 1: yeah most kids don't seem to know how to use canoes and rafts are way harder than canoes for people who don't know how to use them.

505
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,351
Speaker 0: well I mean a raft sucks.

506
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:10,251
Speaker 0: it's a big rectangle just like it sucks right and you can get your raft you just spin around in a circle way worse than a canoe does at least you know.

507
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,498
Speaker 0: at least a canoe has a point.

508
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,411
Speaker 0: so you know which direction is forward or backward.

509
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:21,753
Speaker 1: actually I think the hardest thing that the kids have the most trouble with an actual like traditional rowboat like the slightly wide we have two people.

510
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:23,822
Speaker 0: a rowboat I think is just less efficient.

511
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,833
Speaker 0: so you need more muscles to move it.

512
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:27,922
Speaker 0: yeah and it's heavier and right.

513
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:28,364
Speaker 0: it's less.

514
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,757
Speaker 0: you know dynamic they're also really unstable.

515
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:32,178
Speaker 0: it takes.

516
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,344
Speaker 0: yeah it takes a lot more like you know power to move the rowboat like we had a race you know you could lose.

517
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:43,853
Speaker 0: it's a strong person in the rowboat could lose to a somewhat weaker person in the canoe just because the canoe is better.

518
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:49,635
Speaker 0: it's like yeah you know someone's got a Ferrari and you got a not Ferrari.

519
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:54,212
Speaker 1: yeah I do really enjoy kayaking but I don't like tandem kayaking that much.

520
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:55,438
Speaker 1: I like my own kayak.

521
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,987
Speaker 0: yeah I don't I don't understand.

522
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:04,219
Speaker 0: the two-person kayak is the whole point of the kayak is like ah finally the one-person boat not a stupid two-person canoe action.

523
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:07,437
Speaker 1: the two-person canoe is good well canoe but the two-person kayak is good.

524
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:13,632
Speaker 1: if you're doing distance kayaking like what if you're kayaking like all the way up the river to Yonkers or like beacon or something?

525
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:13,914
Speaker 0: well that's.

526
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,788
Speaker 0: the other thing with the kayak is that it's so tiny.

527
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:19,669
Speaker 0: you can just like throw a rope and just like you know binge off someone else's kayak.

528
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,968
Speaker 0: yeah right it's like I'll just tie myself to your kayak and take a nap.

529
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,799
Speaker 1: but I really enjoy kayaking.

530
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,108
Speaker 1: actually it's a sport I kind of miss that.

531
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:28,656
Speaker 1: I feel like I should get into again.

532
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:29,923
Speaker 0: I like kayaking.

533
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,961
Speaker 0: I just have no arm strength so I can't really do anything except let the water push me.

534
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:34,189
Speaker 1: yeah you know you need to do.

535
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,197
Speaker 1: you know you're biking so much.

536
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:35,944
Speaker 1: you got strong legs.

537
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:43,444
Speaker 1: you got to do that to your arms then you can kayak because if you're strong or I could just not do that but if you're strong kayaks can go real fucking fast.

538
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,332
Speaker 0: yeah what kind of hurry am I in?

539
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,866
Speaker 1: it's just really fun to go really fast in the water like that.

540
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:48,731
Speaker 0: yeah I like some.

541
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:50,238
Speaker 0: I like some lazy river action.

542
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,624
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about fast.

543
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:57,076
Speaker 1: I think I want to go out to Jamaica Bay and rent a kayak and go poking around and all those like marshes and everything.

544
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:57,963
Speaker 0: are you allowed to go in?

545
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:58,285
Speaker 0: there isn't.

546
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,273
Speaker 0: there isn't a reserve.

547
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:00,080
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to go in there.

548
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:08,245
Speaker 1: some areas you know some you can't but there's a lot of kayaking out that way like you can just go out and buy a kayak and tie it to the roof of your car like a yuppie whatever.

549
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:13,336
Speaker 1: no you'd you'd fucking like go out there and rent a kayak and use it there and then leave the kayak when you go home.

550
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:15,287
Speaker 0: I've never seen her kayak rental over there.

551
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:16,495
Speaker 1: there's a lot of kayak rentals.

552
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:16,817
Speaker 1: New York.

553
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,045
Speaker 1: actually there's places here.

554
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:19,935
Speaker 1: you can get kayaks and go up and down the river.

555
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:22,305
Speaker 1: hmm I mean you're not gonna get that.

556
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:22,666
Speaker 0: I've seen.

557
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:26,228
Speaker 0: I've seen kayak in the Hudson River like you can next to the intrepid.

558
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,158
Speaker 0: there's like free there's like kayaking you can just do.

559
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:42,563
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell there's an old thing that they set up where there are campgrounds that are accessible to kayaks and canoes and things all the way along the river from New York City like way up almost all the way to Albany mm-hmm.

560
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:50,997
Speaker 1: so you're then there space such that if you have are a reasonably proficient goer you will get to one every day and be able to camp.

561
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,508
Speaker 0: so you're gonna bike up the Hudson River.

562
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:58,927
Speaker 1: well the Hudson River changes direction so just time it with the tides mm-hmm.

563
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:00,395
Speaker 0: good luck with that.

564
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:01,462
Speaker 1: yeah people do it all the time.

565
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,690
Speaker 1: actually it's a really common hobby.

566
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,532
Speaker 0: they're mad strong.

567
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:12,380
Speaker 0: yeah biking that also no matter which direction the water is moving you're gonna touch Hudson River water.

568
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:16,499
Speaker 1: yeah so I was really learned about that unrelatedly recently.

569
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:24,641
Speaker 0: there are different standards for how dangerous water is based on whether or not yeah it's not the fucking Ganges alright it's not gonna kill you but you don't want to touch it anyway.

570
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:39,366
Speaker 1: Hudson River water is in a category where you do not want to immerse your body in it but occasional contact like in kayaks and canoes totally fine like negligible danger of anything yeah but you'd still be better off not touching it.

571
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:39,929
Speaker 1: I think you're.

572
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,308
Speaker 1: there's more danger eating bacon on a regular basis than there is in that.

573
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:47,830
Speaker 1: so I might take I might do the kayaking trip but don't you eat bacon on a regular basis?

574
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:54,475
Speaker 1: I'm gonna mortise those dangers because I do.

575
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:03,086

595
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:35,733
Speaker 1: as you know we hit the goal.

596
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,210
Speaker 1: I am literally remastering all those beta episodes of geek nights.

597
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:52,255
Speaker 1: it was actually somewhat difficult because they were recorded on incredibly bad hardware with incredibly bad processes a long long time ago but I remastered the first one.

598
00:39:52,275 --> 00:40:05,193
Speaker 1: I am listening to it probably on my way to work tomorrow as a podcast and then I will be able to record some commentary on what it was like listening to us do literally the first geek nights thing we ever tried to do.

599
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:19,133
Speaker 1: some of its funny some of it is haltingly horrific to listen to but it is very interesting to hear what we sounded like because it wasn't most of the time it doesn't sound like I was having a natural conversation like we did in that era.

600
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:29,813
Speaker 1: we actually sound more natural now even though that natural sounding conversation and banter we have is actually sort of an act and kind of synthetic.

601
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:40,283
Speaker 1: so it's weird that when we were more natural on the show it ended up being halting and over time we sort of rediscovered the way to do what we would do in our normal lives but in a performance setting.

602
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:43,444
Speaker 1: and you'll when you listen to the episode you'll see what I mean once.

603
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:46,843
Speaker 1: I actually read some commentary and say it in front of a microphone.

604
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:49,435
Speaker 1: but that's neither here nor there will be a PAX.

605
00:40:49,535 --> 00:41:01,412
Speaker 1: East next week might not do a full set of shows next week because of that but I will release at least that first beta episode of geek nights to all of you who are backing us on patreon very soon hopefully over the course of the weekend.

606
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,922
Speaker 1: and now I leave you with something odd about.

607
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:15,437
Speaker 1: so we got two new DS games just because then you're saying we it's like but it's like there's a third person here.

608
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,924
Speaker 1: they're part of the conversation that I'm not addressing them directly but yeah but even all right.

609
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:23,806
Speaker 0: even then if your selection of words whatever but there's no other way to bring that up.

610
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:27,599
Speaker 0: it's not the tone of the way you're saying it.

611
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,451
Speaker 1: I say that way anyway it doesn't sound right.

612
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:32,654
Speaker 0: that's how I talk.

613
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:37,528
Speaker 0: no it's a bleeding radio guy talking.

614
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:38,150
Speaker 1: oh it's not.

615
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,679
Speaker 1: I think you're hung up too much on this radio guy thing.

616
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:43,870
Speaker 0: it just feels awkward.

617
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:45,757
Speaker 1: that's the way I talk.

618
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:49,834
Speaker 0: it feels awkward when to say something like that and it kind of throws it.

619
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,859
Speaker 1: we're sitting here right now.

620
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:54,193
Speaker 1: I'd be like so we got two new video games this week.

621
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,397
Speaker 1: no you'd be like.

622
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:58,827
Speaker 0: so I got the the Castlevania.

623
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:03,026
Speaker 1: no I'd probably say like so we got trauma center in Castlevania.

624
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:03,609
Speaker 1: there you go.

625
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,876
Speaker 1: he got one I got the other one.

626
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,285
Speaker 1: that way we don't have to buy a boat.

627
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,150
Speaker 0: that's better.

628
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:14,193
Speaker 0: the way you said that the only difference I didn't say we and the tone of the saying.

629
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:19,652
Speaker 1: it was a little different because you're actually talking to me because I actively talk.

630
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:22,154
Speaker 1: weird that's not the way I talk.

631
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:28,983
Speaker 1: I think you're too hung up on this.

632
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:30,668
Speaker 0: it's just.

633
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:32,093
Speaker 0: it's just that like.

634
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:33,999
Speaker 0: it's not really a hang up like.

635
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,267
Speaker 0: I think it hurts the podcast.

636
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:39,799
Speaker 0: it just makes it the the talking awkward.

637
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:41,787
Speaker 0: they're like doesn't mean it does to me.

638
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,194
Speaker 1: well you're not used to this.

639
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:55,282
Speaker 1: I guess I'm really used to speaking in public because you'd like when you speak on a panel or something.

640
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:57,790
Speaker 1: that's the kind of language you always have to use.

641
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:01,967
Speaker 1: and yeah while you're speaking to each other.

642
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:04,800
Speaker 1: not only this is like it's it's like a recording.

643
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,771
Speaker 1: how it's a no because a recorded conversation in and of itself is kind of yeah but that's what all the big.

644
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:16,589
Speaker 0: that's what the podcasting is about because you know people don't like the radio.

645
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:17,757
Speaker 1: that's why they're listening to fun.

646
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:22,813
Speaker 1: no they don't like the radio because there's nothing they want to hear on the radio and that's what the ads on the radio right but the.

647
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:23,858
Speaker 0: that's one reason.

648
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:33,235
Speaker 0: but the other thing is that if you notice the podcast that are stuck in the Brady like this still the normal radio format or don't listen to.

649
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:35,378
Speaker 1: so I don't think we need to worry about that.
