1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,271
Speaker 0: It's Thursday November 22nd.

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:09,230
Speaker 0: I'm rim and I'm Emily and this is the geek night Thanksgiving special where we're gonna talk about London.

3
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:11,659
Speaker 1: It's about our worldwide journey.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah you as many of you know I spent a lot of time in London over the years for work.

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,589
Speaker 1: You spent a lot of time a bunch of places.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,383
Speaker 1: So it's it's kind of nice because I figure a lot of places we're gonna go travel.

7
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,330
Speaker 1: I'll have a built-in tour guide.

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:31,670
Speaker 0: But London was weird because I had like never really had time to sort of tourists there and I was always there for work.

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:40,170
Speaker 0: So I knew London from this perspective of like just living there and going to work and like running in the morning And I never went to like any touristy thing there.

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,830
Speaker 0: I never really saw any of the like sites other than just like wandering around town.

11
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:53,082
Speaker 1: it was actually kind of funny because like once we were there I could recognize some of the places from like Financial industry videos that you had filmed in the past.

12
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:56,790
Speaker 1: I'd be like, oh we just passed that square We're that fixed flyer video.

13
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,159
Speaker 1: yeah, and I mean like.

14
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,988
Speaker 1: I don't feel like our trip was super touristy.

15
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:06,637
Speaker 1: like To talk a little bit about our method of travel.

16
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:18,875
Speaker 1: It's usually like walk all day and just look around When you're hungry go find a place to eat, you know, it's we don't really we plan a little bit But mostly it's just.

17
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:25,809
Speaker 1: you know, if we're feeling hell and ready to go like hike It's I walk like 20 miles in a day.

18
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:36,840
Speaker 0: Yeah Well partly do is that's just kind of what I do when I'm traveling because usually in this travel I just have I have like a couple hours of downtime here and there or more interestingly I really only ever had a lot of downtime at night.

19
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:45,030
Speaker 0: So a lot of these places I've been I'm really like I've only explored them in the middle of the night or in the late evening or the early morning.

20
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:46,976
Speaker 1: So one of the funny things.

21
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:50,229
Speaker 1: so we can just start off and talk about like what we did.

22
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:57,870
Speaker 0: But we got into London, you know in the evening It was already dark, which is my go-to thing like for London in particular, especially from New York.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,830
Speaker 0: Like it's really nice to just kind of leave in the morning and land in the early like to mid evening.

24
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,248
Speaker 0: So you have time to get some dinner and basically just go straight to bed.

25
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:10,727
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, you said you usually you land you have a Caesar salad at that one French place.

26
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:11,790
Speaker 0: I wonder happy French place?

27
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,801
Speaker 0: That's kind of by st.

28
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:13,186
Speaker 0: Paul's.

29
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,409
Speaker 1: It's like right across the street from the hotel.

30
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:19,849
Speaker 1: But it was funny because I did the thing that happens to me every time I go somewhere new.

31
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:24,473
Speaker 1: It's like I'm really unreasonably excited about Everything.

32
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:36,019
Speaker 1: and so the one of the first things we saw when I get outside of Paddington And I took a bunch of pictures of Paddington station and stuff, but I see this pub and I'm like, oh my god It's an English pub.

33
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,570
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take a million pictures.

34
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,310
Speaker 1: So I have all these blurry pictures.

35
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:45,290
Speaker 0: I mean the first pictures I took once we landed are like you and Paddington you in the on the train.

36
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:49,174
Speaker 1: My hair was so bad It's a little grease.

37
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:54,974
Speaker 0: and then you wanted to take a picture in front of one of those weird old-time boots, but yeah Well, that was cool.

38
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:55,957
Speaker 1: That's one of those things.

39
00:02:55,997 --> 00:03:03,250
Speaker 1: That's very symbolic like, you know, not not stereotypical per se But it's like somebody taking a picture in front of a yellow cab.

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:11,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you got a very like quintessential London experience because the first thing we do is walk over to get on the central line, yeah, and it's like weirdly warm.

41
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:17,083
Speaker 0: we get on the subway and You encountered the kind of culture that exists in London that I don't really.

42
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,330
Speaker 1: my god, it was so charming.

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:25,922
Speaker 1: Everyone was drunk But they were drunk and like the most jovial Friendly sort of way like like New Yorkers.

44
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:27,228
Speaker 0: drunk on the subway tend to be either.

45
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,830
Speaker 1: certainly Oh, no, if you see New Yorkers drunk at the subway, I'm like, oh my god, please just go away.

46
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,206
Speaker 0: Maybe the New Yorkers don't interact with other drunk New Yorkers.

47
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:36,889
Speaker 0: They don't know you.

48
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,780
Speaker 1: Maybe it was just cuz I was in a really good mood or something.

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,174
Speaker 1: cuz what I encounter a bunch of drunk bros on the Subway in New York.

50
00:03:43,235 --> 00:04:00,509
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh my god fucking shut up right now I am I don't want any part of that but these people like these 20-somethings were so Excited and they were talking to this older lady and I thought they knew each other like they're talking to this auntie and I'm like.

51
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,590
Speaker 1: So they must be friends no total strangers.

52
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:14,650
Speaker 1: I got off the next stop and it was just like one of those things where they were being like Buddy and having this chat with this total stranger

53
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:21,611
Speaker 0: On the tube because often I'd be out drinking with co-workers or doing stuff at night And that's just kind of how it is Like.

54
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:30,384
Speaker 0: maybe I've always run into that just people are kind of drunk and friendly and strangers will start Conversations with other strangers and actually have those conversations.

55
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:35,184
Speaker 1: and it's like as a New Yorker Usually I would not be in to that but I was into that.

56
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,918
Speaker 1: I was like, this is nice This is a good warm welcome to this city.

57
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,110
Speaker 1: also the tube is super small.

58
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,962
Speaker 0: I know it's a little baby subway like a tiny car.

59
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:46,730
Speaker 0: It basically can't hold any people.

60
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:52,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I was just imagining that at rush hour in New York and I was like, oh that would be such a nightmare.

61
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:55,566
Speaker 0: But like I feel like all this never super crowded.

62
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:55,666
Speaker 0: Yeah.

63
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:59,724
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean we didn't really use it much during the rush hour, but even then it's never.

64
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:02,508
Speaker 0: it's like it gets crowded But it's nothing like New York.

65
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:11,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, also I think every train on all the lines in London combined is less capacity than like the trains on just the four-five In New York.

66
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just they don't hold a lot of people.

67
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,713
Speaker 0: They're not that big and as much as you like to complain as I do how loud the New York City subway is because it's old And crappy.

68
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,190
Speaker 0: the London subway is just as loud just in a different way.

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,000
Speaker 0: It was funny because I was like, oh it's much quieter too.

70
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:35,310
Speaker 1: And then we stood by an open window and I hear like You know, just this horrible creaking subway noise that I'm like, no, I think it's just old subways in general.

71
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:42,856
Speaker 0: Also, it's loud and you have open windows because There's no like HVAC system.

72
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:43,979
Speaker 0: There's no air conditioning in there.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in the tube like it is literally a tube There's not very much clearance at all on either side of the train.

74
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:52,065
Speaker 0: now to be fair.

75
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,590
Speaker 0: The other lines aren't nearly that bad.

76
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,705
Speaker 0: That's the central line which is the oldest subway there is like.

77
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,210
Speaker 0: that thing is ancient and weird.

78
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,937
Speaker 0: It's kind of it's the weird one.

79
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:05,254
Speaker 0: It'd be like it'd be like looking at the sea train and thinking the New York Subway is like that.

80
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean fair.

81
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,469
Speaker 1: But anyway, that was kind of cool.

82
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:23,483
Speaker 1: and You know one thing that struck me while we were walking through London that night is just you know It felt very familiar but it felt almost like being in at a Campus like one of those old colleges like Brown or Harvard or someone's.

83
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,670
Speaker 0: they're like trying to emulate the style.

84
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,429
Speaker 1: It's so funny because it's like, you know the United States.

85
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:34,150
Speaker 1: You know, it's comes from an English colonial background.

86
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:38,305
Speaker 1: So it's like you don't realize how much Anglo influence is in our culture.

87
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:41,377
Speaker 1: until you go to the place It's like oh that's where that comes from.

88
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:42,862
Speaker 1: Yeah kind of feeling to it.

89
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:50,774
Speaker 1: And so like seeing all the architecture it just everything felt super old and stately and You know what?

90
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:54,710
Speaker 1: They would probably Londoners would probably laugh at me for saying something like that.

91
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,832
Speaker 1: They'd be like, what are you talking about?

92
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,058
Speaker 1: But like trust me as a New Yorker.

93
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:00,853
Speaker 1: Everything looks like Very like.

94
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:01,816
Speaker 0: I don't know the Londoners.

95
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:06,310
Speaker 0: I know they're always like very excited like whenever we go any marble facade.

96
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:17,084
Speaker 0: They'd always just be like that pub has been there since 1692 and let me tell you about this pub Reminds me of that old Eddie Izzard bit about like Americans in history.

97
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:17,545
Speaker 1: being like.

98
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:22,180
Speaker 1: this was made 50 years ago and everybody gasps.

99
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:31,710
Speaker 0: No one was even alive back then Because our other big trip a while ago was Australia and we were in Toronto a while ago to other like Commonwealth descending.

100
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:44,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, which are relatively recent, you know, Toronto is actually Canada in terms of its you know national heritage I think is even Younger than the United States.

101
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:55,250
Speaker 1: So any case we get to the hotel and it's just a business hotel because we end up choosing it because I was like Why don't we stay at someplace cheap?

102
00:07:56,171 --> 00:08:05,780
Speaker 0: membership Membership at Club Quarters, which is like this It's really a chain for people who are like literally business traveling because their shtick is if you have a membership It costs the same no matter when you book.

103
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,950
Speaker 0: so you can just like book hotel and it's a guaranteed price.

104
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,658
Speaker 0: There's a guaranteed room if there's like.

105
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:14,661
Speaker 0: you don't have to talk to anyone you just swipe your credit card and a key comes Out of a machine, but I guess you can.

106
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,650
Speaker 0: just I never realized you could book them without a membership.

107
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,874
Speaker 0: It just might cost a little more.

108
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,860
Speaker 0: So we stayed like literally the hotel.

109
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:21,686
Speaker 0: I've stayed at like 12 or 13 times.

110
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:29,430
Speaker 1: Yeah And the nice thing about that is it was a neighborhood you knew really well and like you basically you knew the drill.

111
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:35,480
Speaker 1: so staying at Club Quarters meant like We didn't really have to plan that much.

112
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,169
Speaker 1: It was you know, and they had that automatic key thing.

113
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:46,102
Speaker 1: so you just put in your your credit card and the paperwork was done and And it's kind of a quiet part like basically it was the plate.

114
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:47,528
Speaker 0: cuz I'd say there's three of those.

115
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:50,636
Speaker 0: I would stay So cool less.

116
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:51,480
Speaker 0: I usually stay.

117
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,858
Speaker 0: there's one I'd stay in if the other two were booked But usually I'd stayed either.

118
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:58,630
Speaker 0: the one in Grace Church, which is a little bit Remember when you walk toward the Barbican in that area?

119
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,021
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like the Grace Church is a little more that way.

120
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,624
Speaker 1: Yeah to the st.

121
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:02,006
Speaker 0: Paul's one.

122
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,726
Speaker 1: Didn't we go by Grace Church?

123
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:09,610
Speaker 0: We went through every neighborhood that I knew anything about.

124
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,016
Speaker 1: We basically walked.

125
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:21,130
Speaker 1: if you looked at our heat map of where we walked in London It would basically traverse most of the downtown and we even walked over to like Isle of Dogs and stuff.

126
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,209
Speaker 0: Isn't that what was called?

127
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:27,250
Speaker 0: We went toward Isle of Dogs went to Canary Wharf and then we petered out and got lunch.

128
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:32,587
Speaker 1: Yeah Canary Wharf which was like it was basically like the fight I and it had a lot of kids were anyway.

129
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:36,650
Speaker 0: anyone Who is who asks like hey, what did you do in London on tourists?

130
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,383
Speaker 0: Hey, I went to Canary Wharf because I was one of my co.

131
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:43,540
Speaker 0: I mentioned one of my co-workers from London And he said exactly what I expected.

132
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,830
Speaker 0: All he said was why?

133
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:55,320
Speaker 1: No, we had a really nice dinner and it was kind of like there was this whole restaurant row of all these new new restaurants like.

134
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:59,218
Speaker 0: it's a lot like Stone Street and that it's a place for like.

135
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:13,940
Speaker 0: people don't really live over there and it's quiet at night But all the people get out of work who work there and go drinking and eating like no It really did remind me of downtown Manhattan like financial district Manhattan Except that it was like all new development.

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,670
Speaker 1: Whereas fight I has a lot of the old shit in New York.

137
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:17,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, like like.

138
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,430
Speaker 1: this is our oldest building.

139
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,167
Speaker 1: I don't know if actually the oldest building but I do know the oldest pub in New York.

140
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:23,870
Speaker 1: Is that one?

141
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,721
Speaker 1: That's like right by Wall Street.

142
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:30,168
Speaker 1: Like, you know the Anyway the oldest.

143
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:38,190
Speaker 0: We didn't go into it But we did walk by the Cheshire cheese Which I think is the oldest surviving pub in this actual city.

144
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,990
Speaker 1: I learned a lot about the great fire.

145
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:46,510
Speaker 1: Most things are like this is from the 1660s because it's like that's after the fire and the English Civil War.

146
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:51,668
Speaker 1: So that's really when a lot of these surviving wood structures are from.

147
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:58,250
Speaker 0: Yes So like even when you go to see the crown jewels, it's like these are all after the fire because they got destroyed.

148
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,909
Speaker 1: No, it was because the Civil War.

149
00:11:01,113 --> 00:11:14,049
Speaker 1: Well, and there was the other fire where Cromwell and his shithead Yeah Cromwell was like no more crown jewels melted all down and then they're like after they kicked his butt out and sent the crazy religious people away to.

150
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:16,268
Speaker 1: What became our country then?

151
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,748
Speaker 0: It where they ruined everything over here.

152
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,750
Speaker 1: It was since we're recording this on Thanksgiving.

153
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:28,750
Speaker 1: I was just sitting on the couch and I was like, you know what the pilgrims were kind of fuckers like the pilgrims.

154
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:33,248
Speaker 0: I'd say I'm sick of their shit, but it's a little too little too late.

155
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:35,917
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I was just we're talking about.

156
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:44,726
Speaker 1: I was reading a lot about the English Civil War after the trip on the plane home And I was like, was it King James the second or Kim James the first?

157
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,710
Speaker 0: Who's the one who got chopped?

158
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,260
Speaker 0: I think it was James the second who got chopped.

159
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,327
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

160
00:11:48,448 --> 00:12:03,514
Speaker 1: anyway It was one of the James's and I was like, I don't like him But I think I don't like Cromwell more especially because what he did to Ireland so Him and his pilgrims and all the crazy Religious

161
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,644
Speaker 0: I know he was the way he was the one who succeeded.

162
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:06,910
Speaker 0: I think it was James the first who got shot.

163
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, James.

164
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:10,805
Speaker 1: the second was the one who put the end to Cromwell's bullshit.

165
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:16,670
Speaker 0: This is one area of history I actually don't know that much about like I. just it wasn't really focused on.

166
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:21,287
Speaker 1: There was a bunch of nonsense and that's why the crown jewels are from the 1600s.

167
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 0: Yep.

168
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,967
Speaker 0: So we stayed like right at st falls and we just like walked over the Millennium Bridge and walked around at night.

169
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,810
Speaker 0: and the one thing about Is in a lot of neighborhoods not much is open at night.

170
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,005
Speaker 1: you are hella hangry and I felt kind of bad because it was like.

171
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,661
Speaker 1: I Understand why you were so hungry.

172
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:50,849
Speaker 1: I ate a ton on the plane and so I was like I'm good but like it was 11 o'clock at night and We get into our neighborhood and check into the hotel and then nowhere is open to eat like there was no 24/7 K deli that I could.

173
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:55,130
Speaker 0: The places we could have gone were kind of far away like there's other hip neighborhoods.

174
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:56,174
Speaker 0: It was kind of late for that.

175
00:12:56,194 --> 00:13:05,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, also London in general like move like almost every city I've ever visited just kind of shuts down at night in a way that New York really doesn't in most neighborhoods.

176
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:18,209
Speaker 1: Yeah it's it's kind of wild like Realize it cuz like Tokyo the train stopped running and there's always this rush for all the like the tipsy business Partiers to to get on that last train.

177
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:25,610
Speaker 1: But yeah, London also kind of gets pretty sedate at night and I think we ended up going to a bodega.

178
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:32,241
Speaker 1: You got a bunch of beer nuts In the morning, yeah, but yeah, we ate really well.

179
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:35,110
Speaker 1: when we were there we had one fancy dinner.

180
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,415
Speaker 1: We had one fancy dinner.

181
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:39,910
Speaker 1: That was the second day, but the the first day was my birthday.

182
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:52,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, all we did is we walked around Basically the entirety of like the proper city of London yeah, and crossed the Thames back and forth and back and forth like Did we go to?

183
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,030
Speaker 1: was that the day we went to Westminster?

184
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:56,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, we walked it.

185
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,170
Speaker 0: We basically we walked like over toward Westminster through like Southwark in the south side of the Thames.

186
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:04,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, we walked up to Westminster.

187
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:10,390
Speaker 0: We poked around there and we'd all whack around took a break and then we went to the right instead and went over to Tower.

188
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,555
Speaker 1: Yeah Thing about Westminster.

189
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,400
Speaker 1: that was funny going across the bridge.

190
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,246
Speaker 1: cuz they were like shellgate.

191
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:26,760
Speaker 1: I think you talked about it Like two guys who look kind of the same as the previous group.

192
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:43,709
Speaker 0: You see like every one of them like has two guys doing the thing and every one of them had a tallish woman Wearing black with heavy eyeliner who is clearly like doing the hustle to get the crowd together Like the same woman at every single show game.

193
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:55,153
Speaker 1: It's like this is my con man uniform, but yeah, and the only bummer thing was We saw Westminster Abbey like just from far away But we didn't

194
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,301
Speaker 0: go in any of that nonsense

195
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:02,866
Speaker 1: and was under construction And it was like way too crowded because it was a weekend and tourism was happening.

196
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:09,815
Speaker 1: So we were like, oh, let's Let's hike back and but we had a good proper Upstairs food at a pub.

197
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:14,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had kedgery cakes cuz it's fun cuz that's a thing in Toronto, too.

198
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,678
Speaker 0: You go to like a pub and then upstairs.

199
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,990
Speaker 0: There's just food and Sydney and Melbourne both have that as well.

200
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,245
Speaker 1: That was more just like that specific pub there.

201
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,715
Speaker 0: It's pretty common though Like that's a that's a thing.

202
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:30,650
Speaker 1: the like the Queen the Queen and Beaver in Toronto is a good pub And I go there a lot when I'm up in Toronto.

203
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:40,190
Speaker 0: The first meal we ate was we went into a pub and we wanted food and we could go upstairs or downstairs And upstairs was basically identical to the places we're talking about.

204
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:49,977
Speaker 0: Yeah like same deal and Downstairs was that except there were all these old men who were clearly like friends who hang out there every day drinking Yeah, day drinking and eating food.

205
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:50,840
Speaker 0: and it was.

206
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,910
Speaker 0: it was weird and awkward, but it was easier to eat at the upstairs part.

207
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,940
Speaker 1: Anyway, so that was nice.

208
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:04,029
Speaker 1: We got some food and then We also went to the financial district like the place where the the banks are.

209
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:06,659
Speaker 0: We kind of walk by like cheap side and all that.

210
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,490
Speaker 0: there's not a lot to see over there.

211
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,210
Speaker 0: You kind of just walk through the neighborhood.

212
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,463
Speaker 0: I can point out like that's a bank ride tried to sell some software and like.

213
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,315
Speaker 0: I've eaten at that pub and I've Gone to this place.

214
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:20,169
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and we saw Becky Ham Palace from the outside.

215
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:28,475
Speaker 1: Yeah mostly I really enjoyed walking around in the park because it was like full-on autumn and there were a lot of like Ducks and geese and like.

216
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:33,470
Speaker 1: they were Canada geese and they were kind of sort of coexisting with the local wildlife.

217
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,521
Speaker 1: But they were also kind of getting mad at people who were feeding them.

218
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:37,745
Speaker 1: Like give me food.

219
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:41,079
Speaker 1: I'm a goose and There were squirrels.

220
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,590
Speaker 1: So part-time was nice.

221
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,994
Speaker 0: Yeah We basically respect because it was.

222
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:50,709
Speaker 0: it was fredder naturally warm and sunny and like beautiful weather Except that there were fast everywhere.

223
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,059
Speaker 1: Well, they're also Antifa and there was.

224
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,490
Speaker 1: there was some sort of protest nonsense as best I can tell.

225
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,310
Speaker 0: It was like a soccer club that's fascist and they were trying to do a thing.

226
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:05,910
Speaker 0: There are a bunch of counter protesters like soccer hooligans who have gotten political.

227
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:09,859
Speaker 1: Seemed to be the what I could gather from our cursor.

228
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,015
Speaker 0: We encountered multiple like police like riot police barricades Full shields and stuff.

229
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,827
Speaker 1: So it's like nice walk in the park by Buckingham Palace.

230
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,950
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh There's a bunch of riot police.

231
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:28,425
Speaker 1: So it it kind of quashed the idea that I was like, oh, you know I'm so nice to be a far away and not have to think about the u.s.

232
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:34,085
Speaker 0: Well considering Brexit I mean The same problems happening over there, too.

233
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,151
Speaker 1: It's.

234
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:40,990
Speaker 1: it's not a not a pretty picture anywhere you go, but but that was the only day with nice weather.

235
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh my god, it was gorgeous.

236
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:44,390
Speaker 1: It was just like blue sky.

237
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,921
Speaker 1: I was like, hey everybody says London is so great.

238
00:17:46,941 --> 00:18:00,273
Speaker 1: And then the next day it was like Completely my mental picture of what I thought British weather was good Missed it and rained the entire day after that like every day just Drizzling.

239
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:14,500
Speaker 1: but like it was also it wasn't that cold It was I. I had a bodega umbrella that kept turning inside a lot of pictures But it did its duty like what it was really writing.

240
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,744
Speaker 1: it actually was.

241
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,630
Speaker 0: it could have brought my fancy umbrella.

242
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:22,505
Speaker 1: We could have bought a fancy umbrella But I didn't and it worked and it was fine.

243
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:27,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Then one of my co-workers has suggested there's a play that apparently made it to the u.s.

244
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,829
Speaker 1: So we went and saw a play that was yeah, that was the next day.

245
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:46,983
Speaker 1: So the the first day was walking around looking around and the whole day we wandered and you know until dusk we went by the Globe Theatre and I think I hadn't fish and chips at that place by the By the hotel, but the second day it was like our let's plan stuff.

246
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,349
Speaker 1: So we went to.

247
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:55,730
Speaker 1: We went to Hyde Park, I forget what we were going to do, but we decided it was too much bother.

248
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:57,282
Speaker 1: Oh the British Museum.

249
00:18:57,463 --> 00:18:57,544
Speaker 0: Yeah.

250
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,350
Speaker 0: No, we didn't go to Hyde Park.

251
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:06,083
Speaker 0: we were gonna go to the British Museum and then we decided not to because there was a Crazy line to get in and it was raining and that line just looked.

252
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:08,010
Speaker 0: it was full of miserable tourists.

253
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,703
Speaker 1: It's like a line around the block in the pouring rain and we were like, yeah So we went to a different park.

254
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:18,714
Speaker 0: That wasn't Hyde Park Yeah, actually Regency Park, which I'd never been mark I'd never been up there.

255
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:22,830
Speaker 0: But Regents Park was just like beautiful and we wanted around in the flower gardens.

256
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:29,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the roses were blooming and like it was all the autumn leaves were falling and there were a lot of good dogs.

257
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,697
Speaker 1: We saw many many good dogs.

258
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:41,690
Speaker 0: And so that was actually probably even more enjoyable to me than Then the museum we vaguely considered because we saw there was some sort of dog show thing like down.

259
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,677
Speaker 1: Oh, it was the schnauzer festival.

260
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:58,443
Speaker 1: It was like a walk a walk where all these schnauzer schnauzer parents decided to like walk their dogs together to raise money to rescue schnauzers and Like like dogs who had been in puppy mills and stuff like that.

261
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:03,603
Speaker 1: I was like, this is a good cause Let's go and see the schnauzers, but it was really far away.

262
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:07,019
Speaker 1: And I also think it was more of like Schnauzer people.

263
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,602
Speaker 1: I'm sure they would be fine If a couple of random Americans showed up like.

264
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:13,318
Speaker 1: we'd like to join you on the dog walk But I like.

265
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:20,250
Speaker 1: after I read a little bit more about it I was like, no, this is more an event for dog people instead of people to look at dogs.

266
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,905
Speaker 0: So we had a fancy dinner and we went and saw the play.

267
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:25,089
Speaker 0: that goes wrong.

268
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,001
Speaker 1: The play has gone wrong right?

269
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,547
Speaker 0: or the play that goes wrong.

270
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:31,089
Speaker 1: it was.

271
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:36,578
Speaker 1: Basically The title is very apt.

272
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,543
Speaker 1: That is exactly what you're giving.

273
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,125
Speaker 0: It was pretty fun.

274
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:39,967
Speaker 0: The only trouble with it.

275
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:49,581
Speaker 0: Is that we First it was really step slapstick and the first act was great and really funny and Like it was it was good.

276
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:50,630
Speaker 0: Well done slapstick.

277
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:56,168
Speaker 0: The trouble was the second act was just more of the same and at no point was there a twist or an escalation.

278
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:56,489
Speaker 1: it was.

279
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:58,834
Speaker 1: This is not so.

280
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:03,810
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna sound harsher than it actually was but it was a very shallow play.

281
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,474
Speaker 1: Yeah It's basically just.

282
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:10,670
Speaker 1: the set is breaking and the actors can't remember their lines and the play goes wrong.

283
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:36,449
Speaker 1: And it's at points hysterically funny, you know like sometimes the little subtle things are the The funniest bits like the doorknob being broken or like, you know there will be points where this guy has to play dead and people just like Sit on him or like bump into him and he like, you know, he's obviously he kind of winces in pain but he's still having to play dead and so like.

284
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:40,710
Speaker 1: Bits like that are actually really funny physical comedy.

285
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:51,690
Speaker 1: but I guess I was expecting the second act to kind of often a Play will have a thing happening from one perspective and then like the perspective will change.

286
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:53,477
Speaker 1: But that didn't really happen.

287
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:57,030
Speaker 1: It was just more funny slapstick and I enjoyed myself immensely.

288
00:21:57,151 --> 00:22:05,103
Speaker 1: I left very hard at many points during this production But Yeah, so that was really nice and we went to was super good.

289
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,750
Speaker 1: dinner at that place called Frenchie.

290
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:12,880
Speaker 0: it was like modern French cuisine and And pretty much like the rest of the trip.

291
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,654
Speaker 0: We just like picked a different neighborhood Wandered around it.

292
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:21,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was very happy in particular when we found that one the international incident that occurred.

293
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:27,430
Speaker 1: Two guys whooping this other guy's but it's like general.

294
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:32,070
Speaker 0: The Austrian butcher was recognized and attacked by Barclay and Perkins Draymond.

295
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,352
Speaker 0: It was on the spot in 1850.

296
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:40,038
Speaker 1: It was just two regular dudes saw this Basically a war criminal and kicked the shit out of him.

297
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,502
Speaker 1: and it was like good on ya.

298
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,630
Speaker 1: and those guys were publicly recognized as heroes.

299
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:50,742
Speaker 0: We also encountered a lot of like teenagers Making mischief.

300
00:22:51,267 --> 00:23:00,089
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, the bike kid mischief in London is like very distinct to London Like I don't encounter this kind of bike kid mischief anywhere else.

301
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:06,690
Speaker 1: These punk kids who are like we want to take our bikes into the store and the security guard was like, well,

302
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:18,870
Speaker 0: no I think their thing lately is that they all will be shirtless with like the were their backpacks, but like not wear shirts and Go into shops and then get kicked out of the shop for not wearing shirts because that's funny and the other thing they'll do.

303
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:24,350
Speaker 1: Many instances they were not able to enter the stop in our not even just this trip.

304
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:34,994
Speaker 0: I've encountered this other times too or They will Leave their bikes laying in front of the door of the shop blocking it and get really mad when the shopkeeper tries to move the Bikes, so is this just?

305
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:38,867
Speaker 1: is this literally like a really dumb prank?

306
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:42,360
Speaker 0: It's just their hobby Just like we're gonna be slight.

307
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,585
Speaker 1: every time I've been to London.

308
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:51,970
Speaker 0: I've just seen like Like little young teenagers on bikes with backpacks just being pains in the ass to shopkeepers.

309
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:56,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, well we did observe that while we were walking like in New York.

310
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:03,461
Speaker 0: You see that like in Midtown sometimes around Central Park or even in Brooklyn But they tend to just be shouting at people and biking around like yelling.

311
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,290
Speaker 0: but in London, they seem to specifically bother shopkeepers.

312
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:19,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I never really I guess at least in my experience in New York I have seen like confrontations between like teenagers and business establishments, but usually it's not intentional.

313
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:29,450
Speaker 1: Usually the kids are just like being rowdy or something and somebody will try to like go Leave the McDonald's and the kids are like, no, we don't want to leave the McDonald's.

314
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,009
Speaker 1: So that kind of thing will happen.

315
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:37,950
Speaker 1: But like I've never seen such a coordinated effort to go into the confrontation of the shop security guard.

316
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:43,016
Speaker 0: So the one thing I had done once before and we did it again But much we went everywhere in it.

317
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:45,970
Speaker 0: We spent a long time in there is the Tower of London is super cool.

318
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:48,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was way worth going into.

319
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,528
Speaker 1: Scott didn't believe that it was a castle.

320
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:57,701
Speaker 0: I was like Obsessed with castles and literally doesn't know anything about.

321
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,283
Speaker 0: he's like.

322
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:03,346
Speaker 1: if I went to Europe I would see a castle I'm like, that's literally what we did and he was like Tower of London.

323
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:03,990
Speaker 1: Is it a castle?

324
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder.

325
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:08,321
Speaker 0: he also didn't seem to understand how old that building is.

326
00:25:08,502 --> 00:25:11,070
Speaker 1: Like it's a thousand years old, right?

327
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:13,730
Speaker 0: It's like from the era of William the Conqueror.

328
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,410
Speaker 0: He started building it before he died.

329
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:20,142
Speaker 0: Like different towers in the facility were built in like 1290 or whatever.

330
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:20,723
Speaker 0: like the.

331
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,430
Speaker 1: the white tower is like the oldest structure, right?

332
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,545
Speaker 1: It's like around the time Rome was being kicked out or something.

333
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:28,629
Speaker 0: No, it was literally.

334
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:35,176
Speaker 0: well Yeah, so there was a straw Roman wall there that they incorporated into it But it was literally.

335
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:43,002
Speaker 0: the construction was begun by William the Conqueror who then died like right away and then other people finished it And then they slowly built stuff up around it and it was.

336
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:50,427
Speaker 0: it was basically in continuous use for that entire period until today and it's still in use and there's literally like people who live in it.

337
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,600
Speaker 0: apparently and Like the crown jewels are still stored in the grounds.

338
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,830
Speaker 1: keepers like they have houses on the premises.

339
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:02,712
Speaker 1: actually, I think the Raven guy has house there like I. they live in the Facility.

340
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,902
Speaker 0: we got to interact with the Raven.

341
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:05,244
Speaker 0: Yes.

342
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:11,390
Speaker 1: I was so happy I've decided that I wouldn't want to be a Raven keeper though because they have to feed them dead rabbits.

343
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:17,046
Speaker 1: Yeah sad, but you know, that's what crows, you know, you have to feed crows good food.

344
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,350
Speaker 1: Like what was it?

345
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,629
Speaker 1: Biscuits soaked in blood.

346
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:34,110
Speaker 1: And then the one Raven was like came over to us and he was like Well, like I can't patch you cuz there's a sign right there that says you will bite me.

347
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:35,937
Speaker 0: And he's like, oh you're no fun.

348
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:39,090
Speaker 0: and then he goes over to this girl and she starts to react like oh my god.

349
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,682
Speaker 0: And he starts fucking with her.

350
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:41,750
Speaker 1: It's like pulling.

351
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:48,857
Speaker 1: she had a tote bag right and the Raven likes that's pulling on the bag and go like poo-poo but I'm like trying to Steal her bag.

352
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:50,649
Speaker 0: and she's like, oh no mom.

353
00:26:52,138 --> 00:27:01,726
Speaker 1: And It was like the Raven made like the happiest pace Like it was like open its mouth like ha ha ha and spread its wings.

354
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,770
Speaker 1: Like it was laughing.

355
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:10,933
Speaker 1: Really amazing, but yeah, that was them one of the main reasons I wanted to go to Tower of London Not just because it's famous But because I had.

356
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:16,190
Speaker 1: I followed the waving keeper and they always post pictures of the birds and I love Corvid.

357
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,770
Speaker 1: So I was like, I want to see the team and they're really funny.

358
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,518
Speaker 0: You see I'm just like around like bother people.

359
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:30,016
Speaker 1: you see videos online of them like stealing people's potato chips and stuff like that but they're good birds and So you notice too.

360
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:43,315
Speaker 0: but one thing I liked about London in general was that there's all this old Architecture like Tower of London is just like hanging out there Yeah But also the skyline like has a huge variety of buildings because you kept making fun of that one weird one That looks like an air filter.

361
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:46,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, that what I I'm generally pretty like.

362
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:51,106
Speaker 1: I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to modern architecture cuz there's like the big tall thing.

363
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,190
Speaker 0: There's the gherkin.

364
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,460
Speaker 1: I even like brutalism in certain context.

365
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,987
Speaker 1: I'm like, you know people make fun of that.

366
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:06,704
Speaker 1: and I'm like, yeah It can be rust the rustic concrete can be can be beautiful in its own way But that air conditioner building just looks like an air filter just lose it looms.

367
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,890
Speaker 1: and I'm like, I don't like that building.

368
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:15,810
Speaker 1: It's not aesthetic anti-aesthetic but Anyway with after the tower.

369
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:24,790
Speaker 1: Oh the cool thing about the Tower of London was all the graffiti like the prisoners that poor sorcerer And like the guy who there was a guy and they arrested him.

370
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:35,290
Speaker 1: Somebody was like some nobleman was like he put a curse on me and my wife and he was like, no I I did not put a curse on you and your wife and even though I used to practice sorcery.

371
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:36,721
Speaker 1: I don't do that anymore.

372
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:41,870
Speaker 1: I've gone clean and and Really what he was doing?

373
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,750
Speaker 1: It looked like he was studying star patterns and doing astrology and astronomy and stuff like that.

374
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,921
Speaker 1: He had like this star chart that he carved into the rock.

375
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:52,386
Speaker 1: I hope they didn't chop him.

376
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,390
Speaker 1: That would have been too bad.

377
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,180
Speaker 0: I forget if they did or not.

378
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:56,649
Speaker 0: I feel like they did.

379
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,560
Speaker 1: Maybe let him go.

380
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,280
Speaker 1: we could look it up after yep See what the deal is with that guy and it was interesting to see.

381
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,043
Speaker 1: like it was a military base for a lot of its History and also like all the armor stuff.

382
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,690
Speaker 1: they got wrong like the Victorians.

383
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:20,278
Speaker 1: Victorians are just full of shit like in terms of what they know about history So they wouldn't make stuff up all the time like.

384
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,970
Speaker 1: this is Richard the Lionheart's armor.

385
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:27,810
Speaker 1: It was totally had nothing to do with him.

386
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,997
Speaker 1: it was for 200 years after that, you know, so a lot of the Exhibits were kind of like.

387
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,470
Speaker 1: this has been a museum for like Hundreds of years basically and that was kind of cool.

388
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:45,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had to avoid those screaming kids that were slowly catching up to us.

389
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:49,810
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we were running away from from kids on a field trip.

390
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:51,907
Speaker 1: Here they come.

391
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,616
Speaker 1: But so after that we walked up.

392
00:29:54,677 --> 00:30:03,304
Speaker 1: that was when we went to the Canary Wharf and then we went to the Barbican and wandered around and the Barbican.

393
00:30:03,324 --> 00:30:06,523
Speaker 0: the Barbican is this like Horrid looking but I like.

394
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:09,822
Speaker 0: it has a charm to it but it's it's the stereotypical ugly like.

395
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:15,750
Speaker 0: it reminds me a lot of The reaction and the feeling and like just what it felt like to be around the Rensin in Detroit.

396
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:21,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, it feels very like sit like mid-century 60s 70s Kind of thing.

397
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:27,130
Speaker 1: I don't know when it was constructed But that's like both in terms of its color state scheme and general aesthetic.

398
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:33,550
Speaker 1: That's kind of what it reminds me of and that was when I started getting jet lag really fading fast.

399
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,534
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is.

400
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:37,830
Speaker 1: But like I don't even get so much tired.

401
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:41,923
Speaker 1: I mostly get hungry at weird times and then I'm not.

402
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:53,476
Speaker 1: I don't feel hungry when I actually am Like it will be time to eat and I'll be like my stomach says no But if I make myself eat then it's like it's like a potion has been given to me and I'm like I could see this.

403
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:01,314
Speaker 1: It's just like you feel.

404
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:10,418
Speaker 1: this general Malay is just like stuff is bad and you're just like Little beer into you and you were good to go.

405
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:11,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had some ramen.

406
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:12,909
Speaker 1: It was actually pretty good.

407
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:20,283
Speaker 1: We only went to one like pub to have a pint Yeah, but it was the one you go to on business all the time.

408
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:21,728
Speaker 1: So I felt it was like old.

409
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:26,188
Speaker 0: Dr Butler's head which just happens to be a pub that I would go to a lot.

410
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:27,909
Speaker 1: I kind of like that.

411
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,964
Speaker 1: It was just the most generic pub because it was like if we had gone to a fancy one.

412
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:34,809
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have felt like.

413
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:49,656
Speaker 1: One thing I like about traveling with you is it feels very everyday and that's the kind of experience I like when I'm traveling like going with a friend who lives in that city or going with somebody who's very Familiar with the area.

414
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:51,042
Speaker 1: It's just.

415
00:31:51,203 --> 00:32:00,703
Speaker 1: it feels so much more like regular Everyday life but in a very positive way, you also got to see the.

416
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:07,270
Speaker 0: I want to see the laundromats of your country Proper London drinking culture, like everyone's just drinking out in the street.

417
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's like opposite of Philly cuz.

418
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,642
Speaker 1: Philly everybody's drunk in agro.

419
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:23,890
Speaker 1: this one everybody's drunk and like hey come over Have a pint, you know, it's like that old man in in Japan who is like you weren't with us.

420
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:39,807
Speaker 1: That was when I was with my father, but he's like really good like come on into the izakaya and drink drink here You know, so I I just thought it was very very good and then we walked some more and we went to that That pub that was on the water.

421
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:42,743
Speaker 0: Yeah To have fancy dessert.

422
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:51,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went and got some dessert like a few miles away And that was kind of a nice bookend because that was where we went in the first place.

423
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:58,710
Speaker 0: Yep, we waited but there was too late to get food there and even as hungry as I was beer does not count enough as food.

424
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know Have a pint and then go to bed.

425
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:03,323
Speaker 1: You wake up a little bit of a blurg.

426
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:12,810
Speaker 0: but It's like we spend a third of our time doing like looking at specific things a third of our time Wandering around parks and a third of our time wandering around neighborhoods.

427
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:25,679
Speaker 1: But that's like a really it was a really good balance because we did plan some stuff like the play we planned and I mean we said oh, we're gonna get a fancy dinner before the play and You had some things you wanted to show me.

428
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:29,010
Speaker 1: you're like we should go to Hyde Park at some point and see the buns.

429
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:38,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we didn't see any buns But we saw a lot of good dogs and squirrels and we got a fancy high tea at that random bed-and-breakfast over We that's right right before we got on the train.

430
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:38,930
Speaker 1: We got.

431
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:52,070
Speaker 1: We got like went to some random hotel like not super notable or fancy, but they had like regular High tea, so we got like the little tower with the like right by Lancaster Gate.

432
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:57,850
Speaker 1: And I don't get what the deal is with all the hotels there because there are like a million tiny hotels.

433
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:06,530
Speaker 0: It's kind of it's like all the tourists like that's where they come in because they fly to London They stop at Paddington and they like stay right they just stay right there.

434
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,193
Speaker 1: They're all like.

435
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:09,456
Speaker 1: they're not name-brand.

436
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:10,620
Speaker 1: It's not like airports right.

437
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:19,188
Speaker 1: where they have like this is the Marriott by the airport or something It's like specifically these off-brand bed-and-breakfast that all have funny quaint names.

438
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:21,697
Speaker 0: So there's also like very different.

439
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:37,013
Speaker 1: all those warehouses were like the Days Inn has one of them, but it will be like the Spotted pig and then next to that hotel there will be a Days Inn sign But it's the same kind of building I was like hmm This is like.

440
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:39,161
Speaker 1: that was one of those things that I was like.

441
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:40,505
Speaker 1: we don't have that here.

442
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:43,664
Speaker 1: So Yeah, so that was.

443
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:44,210
Speaker 1: that was good.

444
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,784
Speaker 1: We wandered around in the park and saw that nice garden and then we wouldn't have.

445
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:51,072
Speaker 0: that was like the Princess Diana garden and all That stuff.

446
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:52,820
Speaker 0: I'd never I never been over there.

447
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,206
Speaker 1: We saw three parks.

448
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:58,767
Speaker 1: all in all we saw three parks and walked most of them when we were in the city.

449
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:04,550
Speaker 1: and So for you know four days pretty much of doing stuff.

450
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:12,170
Speaker 0: I think four days is about Like that's about the most time you can spend in London if you don't have a like a specific reason to be in London.

451
00:35:12,871 --> 00:35:17,309
Speaker 1: After that, I figure it would probably just be doing how we do in New York where it's more like.

452
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:22,709
Speaker 1: You know, I'd actually like be working on stuff again working on stuff meeting up with friends that kind of thing.

453
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:32,570
Speaker 0: But like like in Sydney where I were just like I've worked every day in Bondi Junction And then we go out at night and do stuff, you know a weekend on foot to explore a city like Seattle, right?

454
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,570
Speaker 1: It's like if I walk around Seattle, I can explore a lot if I just walk all day.

455
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:45,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, and because we walked all the way to Canary Wharf, yeah Which that's actually my running around.

456
00:35:45,658 --> 00:35:47,706
Speaker 0: I'd usually run away in the mornings.

457
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:48,850
Speaker 1: I was so good.

458
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:50,700
Speaker 1: It was just such a good trip all around.

459
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,670
Speaker 1: you are an excellent traveling companion.

460
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:57,249
Speaker 1: And the funny thing is I remember when you got your passport to go to Costa Rica with you.

461
00:35:57,611 --> 00:36:02,960
Speaker 1: You are the the world traveler who's been Very very many places.

462
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:04,968
Speaker 1: So I'll just follow you around from now on.

463
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:08,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, so great trip.

464
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,679
Speaker 1: Oh, and the other thing is the last thing.

465
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:19,256
Speaker 1: when we were going in Paddington Station, there was a pasty shop Pasties and pasties.

466
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,304
Speaker 1: I like my favorite my favorite foods.

467
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:22,870
Speaker 0: We had pasties today for lunch.

468
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I decided I'm gonna make some you for pasties cuz that was what I was craving and I found a good crust recipe.

469
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,818
Speaker 1: So I put it on my Twitter.

470
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:38,004
Speaker 0: So if anybody wants a pasty crust It's just like a chill modern dense city that like.

471
00:36:38,024 --> 00:36:39,870
Speaker 0: as a New Yorker I could live there.

472
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:40,935
Speaker 1: Like.

473
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:45,336
Speaker 0: I don't say that about a lot of cities, you know It's.

474
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:49,599
Speaker 1: I know it's a silly thing to say But like I feel like a lot of big cities.

475
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,818
Speaker 1: if you go to them and you're used to like that big International city.

476
00:36:53,838 --> 00:37:02,959
Speaker 1: it feels like home like it's kind of the opposite of what people often say about like big cities being alienating and like Feeling overwhelmed and stuff.

477
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,830
Speaker 1: I'm like this feels familiar to me.

478
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:12,910
Speaker 1: This feels kind of comforting and the one thing I loved about London is just there were you know, it was very international.

479
00:37:13,091 --> 00:37:16,150
Speaker 1: It's like every day going about our business.

480
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,767
Speaker 1: We just hear people talking in all different languages and you know feels very much like New York's.

481
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:28,690
Speaker 0: like one afternoon We just went over London Tower Bridge and then we just like wandered around that kind of hipster neighborhood through some like housing developments.

482
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,001
Speaker 1: Oh, I could have totally lived there like.

483
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,750
Speaker 1: it probably cost an arm and a leg in rent.

484
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:35,001
Speaker 1: It looked like a fancy neighborhood.

485
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:36,910
Speaker 0: It looks like most of those places we can.

486
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:40,016
Speaker 1: So it reminded me of like Astoria like.

487
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,342
Speaker 1: it's not like living in Midtown.

488
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:45,310
Speaker 0: It's like South work really feels like Queens.

489
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:48,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that definitely it felt like going to Astoria.

490
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:51,790
Speaker 1: I mean like just like with any foreign city.

491
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:56,130
Speaker 1: It's not like one-to-one and I could be like, oh this is like New York and that is like New York.

492
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:59,048
Speaker 1: But I think you know, I kind of did that in Australia, too.

493
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:04,739
Speaker 1: It's like, you know You just find these points of similarity and you'd be like.

494
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:08,228
Speaker 1: this neighborhood reminds me of Brooklyn and this neighborhood's like.

495
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:10,666
Speaker 1: so but we don't have a castle.

496
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:13,283
Speaker 0: but Well, we had Bannerman Castle upstate.

497
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:14,510
Speaker 1: Well, that's not a real castle.

498
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,810
Speaker 1: That was just that was guy who was basically like a nerd about old castles.

499
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:28,525
Speaker 1: It's it's like like I was saying we got all our weird English Englishness from the original source,

500
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:45,290
Speaker 0: yep like the thing that I always love about being in London and going to like some random pub is that Every pub in the US is desperately trying to look and feel like those pubs But always feels a little shabby as a result like everything is almost made to look shabby and old on purpose.

501
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:58,753
Speaker 0: But then you go to an actually old pub in London and you're like this bar Because it's been there for a hundred years 200 years old and it's full of like the spilled pints of Decades.

502
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:04,730
Speaker 0: so and we had some like mediocre like satisfying pints because there's not good beer in.

503
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:10,326
Speaker 1: Most of the beer was kind of weak sauce, but you know in some ways it was kind of.

504
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:25,250
Speaker 1: I guess it was the kind of beer that's like Kind of like drinking Kirin or something like that where it's light and refreshing and good and not skunky and nasty like Well, I like Corona in its given certain context.

505
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,976
Speaker 0: Yeah but not many though But I do not like.

506
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:36,223
Speaker 0: the only reason I was able to tolerate Corona was that if you were taking Metro North home That was the best beer they sold for the train.

507
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:46,010
Speaker 1: I think it's one of those things where my memory is colored by nostalgia where like Corona was usually the beer we'd order if the alternative was bud.

508
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:59,909
Speaker 1: Yeah so it's like we get this get this bottle of Corona and I remember like listening to your guys show like ten years ago back when we lived at the geek house and I'd be lying on the bed and The windows would be open and I'd be watching you guys record the show.

509
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,142
Speaker 1: And so that's what I associate that particular brand of beer with.

510
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:04,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of funny.

511
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,359
Speaker 1: But Anyway, go to London.

512
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,226
Speaker 1: It's lovely and I enjoy it.

513
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,667
Speaker 1: If I had to live there I would be happy.

514
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,842
Speaker 1: That's what I got to say about that.

515
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:20,658
Speaker 0: So yeah Thanksgivings now, we're gonna actually eat some food.

516
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,143
Speaker 0: scouts off eating food.

00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:30,910
Speaker 1: We're having Thanksgiving bibimbap We have Thanksgiving pasties for lunch and we had very many nice people invite us to share their Thanksgiving dinner.

518
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, but everybody do far away This year.

Speaker 0: we do a different Thanksgiving thing.

521
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,444
Speaker 0: This morning we went and saw an oscar-screener for wreck-it Ralph.

522
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was fun.

523
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:45,969
Speaker 0: We had a pasty.

524
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played some overwatch.

525
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:48,619
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll play a little more overwatch.

526
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:51,289
