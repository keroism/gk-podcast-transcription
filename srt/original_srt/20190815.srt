Speaker 0: Let's do this All right, so my company right.

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,640
Speaker 0: when I for uh, when I first got there like over a year ago Yeah, they were in this office.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:39,512
Speaker 0: It was like, you know above a place where a store would usually go right but if you know pretty big But it was filling rapidly because they keep hiring people like crazy.

8
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,618
Speaker 0: Ah, so they got a space.

9
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:47,460
Speaker 0: that's not we It's not like a we work but it's basically like similar ish you rent a space from another place.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,739
Speaker 0: That's rent ads actually renting the space and they put someone on the other team in there.

11
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:56,113
Speaker 0: But then a new manager came in and they did some stuff.

12
00:00:56,153 --> 00:01:04,120
Speaker 0: So now my team has been in there all year, basically And the company was like, yeah, this is a problem and they've been working on getting a new space.

13
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:06,900
Speaker 0: So at the end of the month, we're gonna move to a new space.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,220
Speaker 0: Basically, they're moving while I'm at pecs and when I come back from pecs, I'll go to this new office.

15
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:13,149
Speaker 1: Yep I'm not way back my old company.

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,300
Speaker 1: we moved to the fashion district And we went to a nice building from the kind of crappy building we used to have downtown.

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,191
Speaker 0: So they got like two whole floors at the top of this building.

18
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,760
Speaker 0: It's you know, so there's a few issues, right?

19
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:25,146
Speaker 0: So good.

20
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:26,352
Speaker 0: I mean going to the new building.

21
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,000
Speaker 0: good in general, right?

22
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:30,647
Speaker 0: Slightly bad news.

23
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:42,508
Speaker 0: when I moved to where I live now to over 10 years ago because I was working in an office and right outside the office was the yellow train and I said Well better get an apartment near yellow train.

24
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,907
Speaker 1: so I can just go straight to our funny similar thing when I moved here Like not too long after you moved here.

25
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:51,740
Speaker 1: I worked at next to Grand Central right on the purple train.

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:58,417
Speaker 1: Yeah So I Moved to an apartment that was also on the purple train and then I changed jobs that work way downtown.

27
00:01:58,438 --> 00:01:59,481
Speaker 1: take the fucking yellow Train.

28
00:01:59,622 --> 00:01:59,863
Speaker 1: Yes.

29
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:03,459
Speaker 1: Anyway, but now I work back next in the exact same place with the purple train again.

30
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,986
Speaker 0: So then cut place.

31
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:10,800
Speaker 0: I work now also yellow train and the temporary place they put us in this year also yellow train.

32
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:14,317
Speaker 0: But now the new office are going to blue train.

33
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,286
Speaker 1: You're taking the E to work.

34
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:18,009
Speaker 0: Well, I get.

35
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:18,993
Speaker 0: maybe I don't know I could.

36
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,038
Speaker 0: we got to figure it out.

37
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,840
Speaker 0: It's not great I could just keep taking the yellow train and then just walk a bunch once I get there.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,395
Speaker 0: So, you know what sucks the E for biking is no issue.

39
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:29,820
Speaker 0: right by bike to work No problem, but in the winter or if it's raining, right?

40
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:37,768
Speaker 1: So issue number two I asked about the E would be really good for me to get to work if I like because living here the E is right There anyway from the seven.

41
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:45,060
Speaker 0: next issue is asked about biking to work and they said yeah Apparently this loading dock at this new office building has bike racks that are first come first serve.

42
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,149
Speaker 0: Oh, so I got to go check it out to see.

43
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,420
Speaker 0: how early do I have to get there?

44
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,651
Speaker 1: Seven and it's already full.

45
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:52,575
Speaker 1: that's not gonna work.

46
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:53,520
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna work.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,359
Speaker 0: So I got to check that out, but it's promising at least right?

48
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:05,113
Speaker 0: So issue number three when I got there and to the way, you know in the previous office right the one that's too full Yeah, they had real shitty chairs.

49
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,856
Speaker 1: Oh That's a deal breaker, right?

50
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,189
Speaker 0: So What I did is I found I got lucky.

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 0: someone in near my near where I live Was moving to California and sold me a legit Aeron chair.

52
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:20,471
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're gonna do the thing that I did it a pretty $200.

53
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,900
Speaker 1: You're gonna bring your own chair to hold on.

54
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,809
Speaker 0: They sold me this Aeron chair for $200.

55
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,275
Speaker 0: I don't need it at home.

56
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,748
Speaker 0: I got a freedom chair at home I don't know right.

57
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:35,989
Speaker 0: So I dragged that fucking chair all the way on the subway all the way to that office and then when they moved us to The temporary office this year.

58
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I dragged my chair.

59
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,659
Speaker 0: There's also shitty chairs, right?

60
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,589
Speaker 0: So they told us, you know, we're doing.

61
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,840
Speaker 0: they're doing like a companies, you know companies move.

62
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:53,960
Speaker 0: They always do a thing where they put a box on your desk you fill the box You can't put more stuff in the box than fits right and then they bring it to the new office.

63
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,851
Speaker 1: I've done this three times in my current job.

64
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,096
Speaker 1: Just moving between it's always.

65
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,020
Speaker 0: it's always the same.

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,460
Speaker 0: I've been doing this to just move between floors of the same building Yeah, and you show up at your new desk on the new day and all your stuff is there.

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's how it works when you're a company that moves, right?

68
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:12,860
Speaker 0: But I'm like, hey How do I get my chair to get moved to this new place?

69
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,954
Speaker 0: So I'm like, do I just put a sticker on it.

70
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:17,339
Speaker 0: cuz I already put a sticker on the bottom.

71
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,047
Speaker 1: This is probably gonna move your chair.

72
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,790
Speaker 1: So

73
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:38,110
Speaker 0: I I'm like, I really don't want to drag it Right, and so I asked and they said him they said yeah in the new office we got these really great chairs and if you don't have a medical reason bring your chair home, and I'm like I don't care what chair you got unless it's air on chair.

74
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, right if it's not air on chair freedom chair, right?

75
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,223
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fight you.

76
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:47,661
Speaker 1: so now like I cannot stress enough the air on chair is the second best chair there is on earth Right.

77
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:53,280
Speaker 0: So now I have to fight I guess tomorrow to send an email just get a crooked doctor to give you a medical.

78
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:56,113
Speaker 0: I don't want to happen but it's like I shouldn't have to do that.

79
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:59,347
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Scott in the real world There's a lot of things we shouldn't have to do.

80
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,099
Speaker 1: I shouldn't have to choose between two political coalitions.

81
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:11,222
Speaker 0: before Before I go get a crooked doctor I'm gonna go to the HR person and look I'm gonna say look don't make me go to a crooked doctor cuz I Will.

82
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,430
Speaker 0: that's right and just let everyone bring their gut.

83
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,180
Speaker 0: there's people in my office, you know, we're all programmers, right?

84
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,845
Speaker 0: Someone's got the bouncy ball.

85
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone's got the weird like knee chair that rocks with.

86
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:22,802
Speaker 1: no are we're the same way Don't you?

87
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:25,173
Speaker 1: my engineers have the balls that they sit on.

88
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:26,620
Speaker 0: everyone's got weird-ass chairs.

89
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,767
Speaker 0: You're really gonna make everyone drink their fucking chairs.

90
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:33,000
Speaker 0: Almost everyone has giant standing - it's like it's like those chairs that you got.

91
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:34,429
Speaker 0: They might be good chairs.

92
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,526
Speaker 0: I'm willing, you know, they haven't sat in them In them or seen them.

93
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,897
Speaker 0: they could be good I don't fucking know but they're not.

94
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,506
Speaker 0: Aaron, you know They're not my $200 air hunt chair.

95
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,108
Speaker 0: That's worth 800.

96
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,796
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe six at the lead, right?

97
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:52,068
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure which model it is.

98
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,660
Speaker 0: It was in amazing condition, but I don't think it's the newest model.

99
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,516
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, cuz there's been a lot of versions, but I mean it's legit.

100
00:05:58,536 --> 00:05:59,500
Speaker 0: Herman Miller air on chair.

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,546
Speaker 0: That's a knockoff one.

102
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:00,827
Speaker 0: Right?

103
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:03,200
Speaker 0: So and it has all the possible adjustments.

104
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:06,941
Speaker 0: It's not that one because that one has a different back thingy There's.

105
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,796
Speaker 1: so there are a ton of - mine just has the horizontal rubbery back thingy.

106
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,285
Speaker 0: other than that It's exactly the same as that only black.

107
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:13,807
Speaker 1: Yep.

108
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't have the modern style back thingy where it's like vertical.

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,249
Speaker 1: ish It's more trying to figure out how much they're on.

110
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,000
Speaker 0: chair actually costs a brand new one.

111
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:25,440
Speaker 0: It costs a lot depending on what model you bought this brand new one.

112
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,388
Speaker 1: I still have the receipt.

113
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:32,175
Speaker 1: brand new ones are gonna be at least Whoa, the air on chair no longer has a lifetime warranty.

114
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:32,977
Speaker 0: That's interest 12 years.

115
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:37,580
Speaker 0: All right, how much is a new one cost for the minimum model minimum?

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,781
Speaker 0: 1275.

117
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:39,002
Speaker 1: Yeah.

118
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:39,343
Speaker 0: Okay.

119
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,691
Speaker 0: That's not what you if you actually went to an office store.

120
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:42,654
Speaker 0: It wouldn't cost 1275.

121
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:46,305
Speaker 1: That's I paid 1100 I think for this one.

122
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:50,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if you buy them new at like a store, they're gonna be eight or nine hundred.

123
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:50,842
Speaker 1: Yeah.

124
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,289
Speaker 1: Oh if you get the basic back, it's cheaper.

125
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,051
Speaker 1: It's 11.

126
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,695
Speaker 1: It saves you like 70 bucks.

127
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,380
Speaker 0: That's not a big savings now.

128
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, you can get a leather armpad.

129
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:00,900
Speaker 1: Why?

130
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,103
Speaker 0: Because you're just.

131
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,289
Speaker 0: you know, why?

132
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,280
Speaker 0: why do people get leather and all kinds of stuff?

133
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:09,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe leather shoes leather jacket not a vegan errand chair anymore.

134
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:17,500
Speaker 0: No Anyway, yeah, I'm curious about this 12-year warranty and I think the thing that I really don't understand about it right is it's like.

135
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,009
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe you know, it's like.

136
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:20,270
Speaker 0: it's like.

137
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,534
Speaker 0: just tell me your reason right?

138
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,739
Speaker 0: It's like there's a reason.

139
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:27,460
Speaker 0: What is the reason that you don't want me to bring my own and everyone else to bring their own guy?

140
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,048
Speaker 0: Why do you insist on me using this chair you bought?

141
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:35,899
Speaker 1: I have learned in my life that there are exactly two possible reasons Why anything like that happens in the world?

142
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:45,774
Speaker 1: Reason number one is the people in charge do not want to deal with anything That isn't uniform because they just don't want to have any hassle in any capacity.

143
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:46,596
Speaker 0: No hassle for you.

144
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:47,560
Speaker 0: Just bring up.

145
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,042
Speaker 1: No, there's.

146
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,106
Speaker 1: everyone has the same chair.

147
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,049
Speaker 1: We control the chairs.

148
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,575
Speaker 1: There's no exceptions to that.

149
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:57,051
Speaker 1: So we don't have to ever think about it Making me your consequences unhappy employee.

150
00:07:57,131 --> 00:08:01,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know because it's not like it's such a minor issue Why would I be so upset?

151
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:08,300
Speaker 0: It's not the chair that I'm actually upset about It's I'm upset that the company makes a big deal about such a minor issue.

152
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:14,635
Speaker 0: They can't just say yes Right the fact that they're gonna be such sticklers about something so minor is what makes me upset.

153
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,685
Speaker 0: not actually sitting in that other chair Which would probably actually be a fine.

154
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:18,087
Speaker 0: Just got.

155
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:24,349
Speaker 1: if you worked in more like in more companies over your career You'll find that most places are way worse than that.

156
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,035
Speaker 0: That's why I don't work in most places?

157
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:36,059
Speaker 1: because reason number two is Someone made an arbitrary decision and no one who has decision-making power is willing to make a different arbitrary decision.

158
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:43,500
Speaker 1: they want to defer to someone else and Everyone will collectively defer to the last person in power who made an arbitrary decision.

159
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,937
Speaker 1: Well the last reason I make so much money is that I am very willing to make Incredibly capricious and arbitrary decisions very quickly.

160
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,549
Speaker 1: well I may not be right.

161
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,969
Speaker 0: when I got to this company They had that policy of like sick day.

162
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,047
Speaker 0: if you if you're sick if you take a sick day you lose a vacation day Yeah, and then I complained and then they changed it.

163
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:09,040
Speaker 0: so to their credit that has been different than every other place I've ever worked well, and they've also been very open right all their meeting.

164
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,340
Speaker 0: You know it's like they share everything with all the employees.

165
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,007
Speaker 0: They don't keep a lot of secrets.

166
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:16,120
Speaker 1: so do you care enough to be like let me bring my chair or I quit.

167
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,366
Speaker 0: I care enough to send an email.

168
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:20,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna send an email tomorrow

169
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:27,284
Speaker 1: because long ago in a different different company I was literally like I'm going to PAX and they're like oh But you don't have enough if

170
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:29,416
Speaker 0: they said you can't go to PAX out and I literally

171
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,079
Speaker 1: was like well

172
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,605
Speaker 0: I wouldn't I wouldn't quit.

173
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:32,770
Speaker 0: I would say I'm going.

174
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,352
Speaker 0: that's basically.

175
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:36,869
Speaker 0: I said if you fire me all right Whatever you're gonna.

176
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,479
Speaker 0: Do you're gonna do, but I'm going.

177
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:45,648
Speaker 0: And I would say I'm going and if you punish me in a way that is less than firing like dock my pay Then I will quit.

178
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,799
Speaker 1: yep Or the alternative is I will just show up until you fire me.

179
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,726
Speaker 1: So in some news.

180
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,417
Speaker 1: There's a bet a whole bunch of stories.

181
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:57,280
Speaker 1: I've been seeing about this.

182
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,687
Speaker 1: They're all kind of the same story.

183
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,300
Speaker 1: there have been multiple incidents of this at different places.

184
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:01,602
Speaker 1: I

185
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:22,309
Speaker 0: saw a one tweet about it And the tweet was pretty much a cover of a saga issue with the relevant princey like character yeah, and then a link to this video of Someone seemingly cosplaying as you know the prince from saga with a big TV on their head yeah, putting a TV on a porch and running away

186
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:25,780
Speaker 1: just showing up at people's houses in the middle of the night and just

187
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:26,964
Speaker 0: Leaving

188
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:27,606
Speaker 1: and old teeth.

189
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,335
Speaker 1: now the news articles are often saying vintage TVs.

190
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,061
Speaker 1: These are not vintage TVs They're just.

191
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,767
Speaker 0: these are shitty TVs.

192
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:38,892
Speaker 1: There's a very clear distinction if someone dropped off like a 50s era TV.

193
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:39,820
Speaker 1: that would be awesome.

194
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would take that.

195
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,900
Speaker 1: but these are basically what these are my suspicion.

196
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,427
Speaker 1: I have a read into what's going on here.

197
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:53,130
Speaker 1: this person or these people have all realized that They have a bunch of old TVs, which are basically toxic waste.

198
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,840
Speaker 1: yep old CRT's are filled with dangerous toxic shit.

199
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,406
Speaker 1: It's difficult to throw them away.

200
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:00,032
Speaker 1: It's often expensive to throw them away.

201
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:03,607
Speaker 1: They can't be recycled like Depends on where you live right.

202
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:06,280
Speaker 0: so for example in New York you could bring them to the safe disposal.

203
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, once a year right.

204
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:12,980
Speaker 0: and where my mom lives in Connecticut You can drive to the transfer station and put them there in a special place.

205
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:18,366
Speaker 0: But they're generally difficult to get rid of if you have a lot of them Especially if you're like commercial.

206
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,997
Speaker 0: like if you're a commercial business you can't go to either of those disposal places right.

207
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:27,574
Speaker 0: also If the TVs are not good quality CRT's no one wants them.

208
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:33,580
Speaker 0: if they are good quality Maybe some Smash Brothers players who need game cubes would want them.

209
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:37,640
Speaker 0: But they only want them if they work really well and are good.

210
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:38,963
Speaker 0: so it's like odds.

211
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:42,674
Speaker 0: are most CRT's you have are broken or bad.

212
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:46,025
Speaker 0: the very very few are good and Working.

213
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:49,147
Speaker 1: I remember trying to get rid of that 1974 color RCA.

214
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,180
Speaker 0: yeah a lot of arcade machines actually old arcade machines.

215
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,560
Speaker 0: It's like the boards all still work great or can be fixed, but it's like well the CRT's busted.

216
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,626
Speaker 0: I guess I had to.

217
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,477
Speaker 0: you know I can't play Dig Dug now yep.

218
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:11,194
Speaker 1: So I suspect that whoever is doing this very cleverly realized that if they make it look like a prank They can basically just leave their toxic waste at people's houses.

219
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,800
Speaker 0: This is just totally get away with right?

220
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,162
Speaker 0: It's like.

221
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,087
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

222
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,520
Speaker 0: you know we don't know what the real thing is going on here.

223
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,537
Speaker 0: But my first my immediate reaction was oh illegal dumping.

224
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:22,563
Speaker 0: yeah It's illegal Should I?

225
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:27,077
Speaker 1: I should dress up as a book and just start leaving all my old books on people's porches.

226
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:33,835
Speaker 0: and like outer queens Yeah, like yeah, I mean there's a place in Brooklyn ish known as the hole which is.

227
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:38,285
Speaker 1: we just ran a u-haul drive upstate Place to go, but it's.

228
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:47,019
Speaker 0: it's basically this triangle of land where people kind of live that floods a lot Connected to any utilities really well and is really bad place.

229
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could go dump your shit there.

230
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:55,100
Speaker 1: So I'm pretty sure that is the full extent of what is going on here.

231
00:12:55,441 --> 00:13:03,640
Speaker 0: But in the meantime it is also in addition to illegal dumping helping them the illegal dumpers It has also provided the world with some great videos.

232
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:11,671
Speaker 1: Yep Like it is and it's kind of like there was a trend a while ago where people would like dress up as clowns or dress up as scary things or like leave weird dolls on people's porches.

233
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:18,280
Speaker 1: these kinds of pranks are happening more and more because It's really easy to pull them off and now everyone has a camera on their door.

234
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:22,877
Speaker 1: So it's really easy to like get people to spread your viral message.

235
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:23,619
Speaker 1: Whatever it might be.

236
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:30,980
Speaker 1: So in some other news As you all know Twitter is mostly filled with like Russian bots and Nazis and stuff.

237
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:41,400
Speaker 1: there are some people talking but it's mostly bots and As you know China is trying to destroy Hong Kong and these kids are fighting for their lives to maintain some level of democracy there.

238
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:47,548
Speaker 1: so China unlike Russia Does not know how to play the bot game.

239
00:13:48,170 --> 00:14:06,462
Speaker 1: So basically over like the last few days The Chinese government it looks like they have just made thousands and thousands and thousands of bot accounts on Twitter and they're all tweeting the same Propaganda and it's so ham-fisted and so pathetically done Like.

240
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:12,863
Speaker 1: it's like they're not even trying like they're doing the kind of bot attack that you would try to do in the 90s of social Media existed.

241
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:17,880
Speaker 1: so there's this legion now of these accounts with like random art.

242
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,840
Speaker 0: I mean it could just be really poorly skilled Chinese sympathizers and not China itself.

243
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,971
Speaker 1: Yeah I do doubt it right.

244
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:31,614
Speaker 0: like if you see in Australia There are like some students who are pro-china who are getting rowdy and I'm pretty confident.

245
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,360
Speaker 0: Like I'm not have obvious information.

246
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,088
Speaker 1: Oh, they're more like a standalone complex type situation.

247
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:36,991
Speaker 0: I think that they're lit.

248
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,757
Speaker 0: I think that they are just honestly.

249
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,563
Speaker 0: they're from China They're Chinese.

250
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,520
Speaker 0: They're in Australia and I think they're they're honestly just pro China.

251
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Speaker 0: Well, I like if some Trump people from America just went to France and got rowdy it's like they're just legitimately.

252
00:14:52,601 --> 00:15:00,626
Speaker 1: However, I I would make the counter-argument that much like stochastic terrorism that is simply stochastic stochastic Memetics.

253
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:01,576
Speaker 1: Yes, that is.

254
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:16,440
Speaker 0: second But the point is there is still a difference between that and an actual government explicit directive like the CIA Operation to overthrow a government or something true, but then there's the weird gray line Like what about when the government just encourages people to do that?

255
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,963
Speaker 1: And then there's unrelated to the government entities that funded and there's a shadowy circle of money Like.

256
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:23,967
Speaker 1: what's the exact line?

257
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,011
Speaker 0: It depends on a lot of things.

258
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:34,505
Speaker 1: so details if you see Twitter accounts talking about how bad these protesters are in Hong Kong Click on one or two of them.

259
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:35,428
Speaker 1: They probably.

260
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:39,440
Speaker 1: you'll probably literally find thousands of accounts that are identical with no followers.

261
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,392
Speaker 1: They were all created in August.

262
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:47,295
Speaker 1: They have no followers They're following no one and they've all tweeted one thing which is a tweet with the same text.

263
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:52,240
Speaker 1: and these like really obvious terrible propaganda images that are anti Hong Kong freedom.

264
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,732
Speaker 1: What's really bothering me is that Twitter lets this shit happen.

265
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,060
Speaker 1: Like this is so easy to stop, right?

266
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,020
Speaker 0: It's like really you're this like one of the most major websites in you know applications in the world.

267
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:13,093
Speaker 0: You have an army of talented programmers Some of them right and in the developers and designers and all kinds of people working there are huge and get all this money Even though you're not making money.

268
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:21,165
Speaker 0: you got money And you can't just stop people from just making a bunch of fake accounts like the simplest thing that you can do with the WordPress Blog.

269
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,380
Speaker 0: stop you from making fake accounts.

270
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,065
Speaker 0: I mean you can't stop that.

271
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:36,760
Speaker 1: click on any tweet by like any Democratic politician in the US and the replies are just thousands and thousands and thousands of obvious bots maybe hundreds, but the point is On the to make a Twitter account.

272
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:43,160
Speaker 0: It shouldn't be so easy to just make an account and start tweeting that without being a real person.

273
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:43,918
Speaker 0: How hard is this?

274
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,340
Speaker 1: Well, I've said this on Twitter on Twitter a bunch of times But it's harder to make an account on our forum than it is on Twitter.

275
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:55,416
Speaker 1: So what people seem to forget because it's before the living memory of most people online today.

276
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:56,740
Speaker 1: Is that email?

277
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,455
Speaker 1: Was kind of like Twitter and all these things anyone could just make an email server.

278
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:04,619
Speaker 1: in the early days All email servers just trusted all other email servers.

279
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:13,073
Speaker 0: Now you could well because in the beginning the only email servers were the few people that were on the internet And they were all sophisticated yep like colleges and labs and shit.

280
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:16,905
Speaker 1: and then spam appeared and spam Literally overnight destroyed email.

281
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:28,835
Speaker 1: and the only reason the sole reason that we can still use email even exists today is because AI's Automatically block like ninety nine point nine nine percent of all email.

282
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:35,700
Speaker 0: right a mad go to your email And I dare you to dump your spam folder on Gmail into your inbox, and it's unusable alright.

283
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:48,300
Speaker 0: So the only reason email even exists today is because we invented and perfect or almost perfect And we didn't need to perfect people right very willing to lose the real emails just to Nazis right.

284
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,733
Speaker 0: We made a good enough that got even better to be.

285
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,098
Speaker 0: it's now really really good.

286
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,765
Speaker 0: not perfect But extremely good.

287
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:58,080
Speaker 0: spam filters and now email is usable and good again.

288
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,991
Speaker 0: What in the meanwhile Twitter Facebook etc.

289
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:02,552
Speaker 0: etc.

290
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,300
Speaker 0: there's no spam filter on in the other way.

291
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:09,716
Speaker 1: Because you know in the early when spam first became a thing there were big debates about what to do.

292
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:16,540
Speaker 1: people worried like oh Free speech like you can't block email content and we realized blocking email content was literally the only way.

293
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:23,160
Speaker 1: The alternative was to charge a nominal amount of money to send an email and there was no way to make that happen.

294
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:32,660
Speaker 1: No, but with something like Twitter Twitter could just say it costs one US dollar per year to have a Twitter account.

295
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:43,515
Speaker 1: almost every bot account would disappear overnight because a dollar a year times millions of fake accounts is Not feasible for anyone to pay for and to be able to pay now.

296
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,904
Speaker 1: There's an accountability traceability Aspect.

297
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,655
Speaker 0: I think a better idea, right?

298
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,460
Speaker 0: Which I've wanted to do for some time is to just have fines the same way that fines exist in like sports leagues.

299
00:18:55,841 --> 00:19:01,522
Speaker 0: It's like I you did performance dancing drugs for game suspension and million-dollar fine or a hundred thousand dollar fine Whatever.

300
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:05,680
Speaker 0: and the way you do this is you force everyone to have a credit card attached to their account.

301
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:09,500
Speaker 1: So poor people can't use Twitter because they don't have credit cards or some kind of thing attached.

302
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,388
Speaker 1: People can't use Twitter they don't have a bank account.

303
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,760
Speaker 1: it's a positive some kind homeless person can't afford any amount of money.

304
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:18,110
Speaker 0: You got to do something.

305
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:19,460
Speaker 0: You got to have some amount of money.

306
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,890
Speaker 1: That's why I'm saying the real way to do this point is have a eyes like literally just shadow ban 99.9% of all.

307
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,459
Speaker 0: Twitter should be doing that also.

308
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:33,920
Speaker 0: Yes fan filtering but just make people have some kind of deposit or some sort of thing linked to their account.

309
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:37,640
Speaker 0: Check it to make sure it never like closes or goes away or anything.

310
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,880
Speaker 0: So you don't just like use a stolen credit card, right?

311
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:44,889
Speaker 0: And then if the person ever misbehaves if I can take all their money I do also still like the idea.

312
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,692
Speaker 0: it's like you could do it for counter-strike like, okay You have to have a valid credit credit card.

313
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:54,578
Speaker 0: you can play a free counter-strike But if you cheat we take you take the fold up and we take your full balance of credit card.

314
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:56,324
Speaker 0: That's it Cheated.

315
00:19:56,485 --> 00:20:00,248
Speaker 0: you got us $1,000 now cheater So the other even better.

316
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:03,360
Speaker 0: give that cheating money to all the people you cheated against.

317
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,059
Speaker 0: That'll make people want to play and not cheat.

318
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,651
Speaker 1: Oh, did you see I was gonna save this news for Monday?

319
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,916
Speaker 0: everyone who saw your spam.

320
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:10,900
Speaker 0: now you owe them all a dollar.

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,269
Speaker 1: Did you see all those kids who have fucking owned?

322
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:21,266
Speaker 1: because all the counter-strike cheats on the internet are like really bad malware Mmm, and a bunch of?

323
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:24,980
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm pretty sure like there are plenty of ways to get cheats for games.

324
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,039
Speaker 0: But I imagine if you go to Google and type in fortnight cheats, you're not getting any fortnight sheets that work.

325
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:40,469
Speaker 0: or To get the real fortnight sheets You got to go to the secret webs, you know and get in the IRC channel with the people who make the fortnight And be their friend.

326
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,319
Speaker 1: these kids don't know what it was like to get wares.

327
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:43,298
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

328
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:49,098
Speaker 1: but I always think back to that idea we've had that we've never really tried to do anything with of you.

329
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,386
Speaker 1: have you have a thing like Twitter.

330
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:56,093
Speaker 1: that's invite only and Whoever invited you can cut you off if they want.

331
00:20:56,113 --> 00:21:04,840
Speaker 1: so they're responsible for you And if - and basically if too many people you invited end up being pieces of shit you get kicked off the network.

332
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,605
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's just.

333
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,540
Speaker 0: you're responsible for the people under you, right?

334
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:14,767
Speaker 0: So if I invite you and you invite Joey Jojo and Joey Jojo invites his uncle and the uncle invites a Nazi Right, Joey.

335
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,651
Speaker 0: Jojo is just right.

336
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:17,299
Speaker 0: The uncle is responsible for getting rid of the Nazi.

337
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, if he doesn't do it Joey Jojo is responsible for getting rid of the uncle.

338
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, Joey Jojo doesn't do it.

339
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:25,919
Speaker 0: You're responsible for getting rid of Joey Jojo and if you don't do it, I'm responsible for getting rid of you.

340
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:41,779
Speaker 0: Yeah so it's like you're basically under this pressure from the top of whoever invited you because they're vouching for your Goodness on the network and you basically if you misbehave on the network Then you lose your standing and if no one is vouching for you on the network, then you're out.

341
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's it's really good.

342
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,180
Speaker 0: The reason the system is good is because it solves this problem of prevent bots from joining and mass.

343
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:54,395
Speaker 0: Because okay, Joey Jojo invites his uncle the uncle wants a Nazi.

344
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:59,520
Speaker 0: the Nazi invites a bot network Although that you can just ban the Nazi and the whole bot network falls off.

345
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,160
Speaker 0: You don't need to like, you know figure out individually with some advanced AI or spam filter type stuff.

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,089
Speaker 0: Advanced AI though!

347
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:07,179
Speaker 1: You don't need an advanced AI.

348
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,853
Speaker 1: Just have something that looks for anyone who tweets the hashtag.

349
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,360
Speaker 1: I stand with Vic and they're gone.

350
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,624
Speaker 0: But the point is you can just.

351
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:22,200
Speaker 0: you can just drop huge numbers of accounts with like a single click really easily And it's very hard for anyone to flood the network with that biz.

352
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:22,761
Speaker 0: But what's

353
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:34,716
Speaker 1: funny about this China thing is that the Russian bots like all these Russian bot accounts have all this like Almost normal-looking activity that's scripted and you really got to look at it to find the trend of like, oh

354
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,361
Speaker 0: they try hard Yeah,

355
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:39,452
Speaker 1: but China's like not even trying like.

356
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,040
Speaker 0: I don't know if China itself is doing it stuff.

357
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,092
Speaker 1: It's either China directly or China stochastically.

358
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:46,598
Speaker 1: It's one of those two.

359
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,796
Speaker 1: So in some other news YouTube is changing how copyright claims work.

360
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:53,840
Speaker 0: Well sort of right?

361
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,266
Speaker 1: So they're only to read this article at all.

362
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:58,020
Speaker 0: So the only way they're changing it is with regards to music, right?

363
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:03,260
Speaker 0: So the way it works now is let's say you got a little bit of music in in your YouTube video.

364
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,327
Speaker 0: I may be a little I don't know a little.

365
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:06,591
Speaker 0: Rolling Stone maybe right?

366
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:09,320
Speaker 0: So currently the Rolling Stones come along.

367
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:14,619
Speaker 0: They could be like, all right Take that shit out of your video or we're gonna put ads on your video and make money.

368
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:19,000
Speaker 1: And they can do that even if it's just like two seconds of the audio in the background of a four hour long.

369
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,257
Speaker 0: So the new what they're changing it to is it basically gives them two choices.

370
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:29,894
Speaker 0: now right choice Number one is They can prevent you from making money on the video which okay, but you can't.

371
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:39,220
Speaker 0: they can't make any money that I like Right, so it's basically like okay We're you know more money for you person who made the video with my music in it, but no money for me either.

372
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:40,320
Speaker 0: I didn't make this video.

373
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,125
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the article says this really well.

374
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:47,400
Speaker 1: now when a copyright claim is manually filed specifically for very short clips, right?

375
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,468
Speaker 0: So it's only manual Takedowns not the automatic takedowns.

376
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,220
Speaker 0: Those are still the same and it's only for short clips.

377
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:55,509
Speaker 0: There's only two.

378
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:56,859
Speaker 0: there's gonna be fewer choices.

379
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:01,880
Speaker 0: choice One is no money for anybody on this video and choice two is take the video down.

380
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,879
Speaker 0: Now the problem is well the thinking behind this change is alright.

381
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:17,526
Speaker 0: people who want to make money are incentivized to sort of go out and find any video with even a clip of their music in it and Claim it so they can make a lot of money Primarily because it's like a money.

382
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:22,048
Speaker 1: those claims like if like all I a lot of my antenna videos have claims like that on them That I gave up on.

383
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:30,868
Speaker 0: there's a monetary incentive like go out and claim every video that you can possibly claim and you will make some money and Clean them out and you'll make enough money.

384
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,233
Speaker 1: Just go and do it.

385
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:43,520
Speaker 1: There's also a disincentive from people who have Legitimate fair use rights like say me with do ten of videos to fight those claims because those claims don't actually take your video down.

386
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,220
Speaker 1: You just lose ad revenue and someone else is making money.

387
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:51,280
Speaker 1: But if you fight those claims you could get a copyright strike and you could lose your whole account.

388
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, you lose my whole gig nights account by fighting one of those.

389
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:54,603
Speaker 1: I usually don't.

390
00:24:54,644 --> 00:25:02,931
Speaker 0: somehow YouTube does a good job of keeping people from making a thousand accounts Or at least you never see them right.

391
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,118
Speaker 0: you just see the Nazis who have made real accounts.

392
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:08,260
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, not bought Nazis anyway.

393
00:25:09,487 --> 00:25:12,520
Speaker 0: so The other option is to just take your video down.

394
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,400
Speaker 0: So the thinking is people will stop take bothering with manual takedowns of short clips because they won't make money on it.

395
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:26,627
Speaker 0: There's no incentive for them to go do this Manually, but the other thinking is like yeah People will probably just take down all these.

396
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:30,620
Speaker 0: there'll be more takedowns and let instead of letting videos be up with.

397
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,160
Speaker 1: Everyone involved in this doesn't understand about these music companies.

398
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:39,070
Speaker 1: They would rather fucking just destroy you.

399
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,840
Speaker 0: Well, some of them would write to them in my experience, right?

400
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,281
Speaker 0: Well, I think it.

401
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:43,787
Speaker 0: you know, they're really aggressive.

402
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:46,195
Speaker 0: America depends on the Japanese ones.

403
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:47,480
Speaker 0: They just want to take down everything.

404
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, Japan like.

405
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,129
Speaker 1: it's interesting when I get Japanese.

406
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,413
Speaker 1: They're the worst against my videos.

407
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,400
Speaker 1: They never monetize.

408
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,672
Speaker 1: They just globally block instantly, right?

409
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,080
Speaker 1: And actually a lot of my youtube videos.

410
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:04,399
Speaker 0: Well, we just thought about Nintendo is aggressively going after videos that contain Nintendo music them and trying to take them down, right?

411
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:09,942
Speaker 0: But you know, it's clearly if you look at the evidence that is a dumb strategy Right.

412
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:18,280
Speaker 0: Japan is a country with many people in it Right and creates as a lot of money and creates many things both physical and artwork and otherwise, right?

413
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:22,745
Speaker 1: Yet kids ain't talking about j-pop these days They're talking about kpop.

414
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:28,866
Speaker 0: Korea South Korea a very tiny country that may actually Mathematically people are concerned.

415
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:34,540
Speaker 0: It's not a joke may run out of people because they're not making enough babies Right or they could allow more immigration.

416
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:43,550
Speaker 0: Right a miniscule country on the scale of things with way less stuff than Japan Right has made a huge global impact.

417
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:50,847
Speaker 0: right with music and our things that are popular worldwide simply because There are many reasons.

418
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:54,140
Speaker 0: but the number one reason is they just let their shit spread.

419
00:26:54,422 --> 00:26:57,640
Speaker 0: They just dump every to constantly uploading everything to YouTube.

420
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:05,080
Speaker 0: They're constantly letting all their TV shows be KBS Which is basically like the the the national TV station, right?

421
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,800
Speaker 0: They put most of their shows on YouTube with subtitles for free.

422
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:12,518
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just like they just do it worldwide.

423
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:12,820
Speaker 0: everyone.

424
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,825
Speaker 0: Please watch Korean TV with subtitles.

425
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:21,566
Speaker 0: and they just have been doing this for years and years and years like Ted like almost 10 years Maybe even that long.

426
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,209
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

427
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:24,180
Speaker 0: since 2012 when I started paying attention.

428
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:37,177
Speaker 0: They become a global media phenomenon and Japan still to this day is like yeah Nintendo We're not gonna release mother 3 in the u.s Well, it's like yeah, you're making a remake or whatever.

429
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:37,840
Speaker 0: you take that shit.

430
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,010
Speaker 0: Oh, we're gonna take down every live stream.

431
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,597
Speaker 1: Anyone's ever done of Zelda.

432
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:42,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, j-pop.

433
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,195
Speaker 0: We don't want anyone outside Japan to listen to that.

434
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 0: take all that down.

435
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,352
Speaker 0: No one's allowed to listen to j-pop unless they live in Japan.

436
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:47,835
Speaker 0: j-rock.

437
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:48,156
Speaker 0: Nope.

438
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:48,820
Speaker 0: Can't listen to it.

439
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,744
Speaker 0: You can buy our $80 CD.

440
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:55,124
Speaker 0: yes buy an $80 CD or $50-100 DVD.

441
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:57,209
Speaker 0: That's the only way you can watch any Japanese stuff.

442
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,151
Speaker 0: subtitles.

443
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:00,356
Speaker 0: No only unlike this one service.

444
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,382
Speaker 0: No, not allowed anime All right.

445
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:03,728
Speaker 0: Well, maybe are a crunchy roll.

446
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,456
Speaker 0: Maybe you know manga.

447
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have ten bucks.

448
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:08,065
Speaker 0: It's like Jesus Christ.

449
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:12,417
Speaker 0: if Japan if I was like, but you know the I guess what?

450
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:16,111
Speaker 0: Prime Minister Japan I would just be like.

451
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:16,960
Speaker 0: look everybody.

452
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:22,255
Speaker 0: Put all media online with subtitles in every language possible for free.

453
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:22,876
Speaker 0: We're doing it.

454
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:23,177
Speaker 0: Now.

455
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:24,180
Speaker 0: This is the new policy.

456
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,603
Speaker 0: Just government And Japan.

457
00:28:28,684 --> 00:28:34,480
Speaker 0: if they did that they could even still even after all this bad juju of all these years of holding back.

458
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:41,240
Speaker 0: They could become like how almost Hollywood level media worldwide power if they just did that.

459
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:50,452
Speaker 0: Imagine if you just watch all Japanese TV with subtitles all those wacky shows all the not wacky shows All the animes all the musics all the video games.

460
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:51,816
Speaker 0: Just like just fucking do it.

461
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:52,880
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

462
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,379
Speaker 1: So there is a big problem with this change.

463
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,324
Speaker 1: Quote from the article.

464
00:28:57,345 --> 00:29:00,576
Speaker 1: youtubers themselves will have no say in the process.

465
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:01,499
Speaker 0: No, they never do.

466
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,607
Speaker 1: No No this you can't even dispute these.

467
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:04,129
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

468
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:11,420
Speaker 0: You cannot dispute these claims anymore All right, so I mean if you're trying to make money, so if I have a legitimate fair use video, I'm just fucked.

469
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,220
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you can get your lawyer.

470
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:23,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to get your lawyer which and by YouTube I can get my lawyer and I might be able to win because these are pretty clear-cut cases, but Random livestream kid cannot afford a lawyer.

471
00:29:23,751 --> 00:29:27,966
Speaker 0: No, I think if it's a if your video gets taken down I feel like then you should be able to dispute.

472
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:33,405
Speaker 1: but if they're removing the dispute process for this particular kind of claim Yeah, that's that's BS.

473
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:36,399
Speaker 0: But if you're just get D monetized, right?

474
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:38,288
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot.

475
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:41,086
Speaker 1: if you just get D monetized honestly I don't care.

476
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:43,960
Speaker 1: because right you're not making enough money from YouTube to live.

477
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:49,960
Speaker 0: Well, even people who are making enough money from YouTube to live I basically have no simply like, you know people get all up in arms.

478
00:29:50,040 --> 00:30:04,980
Speaker 0: Okay, that money comes from advertising which is already unethical right but or YouTube premium, but point is is like People because YouTube started paying creators, which I guess they should or shouldn't depending on how you feel about it, right?

479
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:11,860
Speaker 0: It's like, you know Twitter doesn't pay me for my fucking tweets Facebook doesn't pay me for Facebook posts, right?

480
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,236
Speaker 1: Maybe I should nationalize YouTube and just make it the national.

481
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,140
Speaker 0: that would be a good thing.

482
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:25,993
Speaker 0: But regardless it's like you don't have some right to be paid for putting your content on voluntarily Putting content on this other platform.

483
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,320
Speaker 0: It's like you put it there.

484
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:28,746
Speaker 0: It's like you're not get it there.

485
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:31,679
Speaker 0: You're lucky that they're agreeing to pay you.

486
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,431
Speaker 0: Well even right so they decide not to pay you.

487
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,640
Speaker 0: I don't really think you have a lot of calls to complain.

488
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,680
Speaker 0: You're lucky that it's even possible to make a penny from that.

489
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:45,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, like people don't seem to remember that the fact that I can just upload videos to the internet is still crazy.

490
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you're lucky that they're even letting you do this.

491
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:48,751
Speaker 0: That's great.

492
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like but yeah, it's of demonetization.

493
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:53,140
Speaker 0: I have no, you know sympathy.

494
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:53,964
Speaker 0: I think this is demon.

495
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:57,480
Speaker 0: I think they were as actually maybe a mistake to add any monetization to YouTube.

496
00:30:58,463 --> 00:31:05,774
Speaker 1: And just you know, they should have provided API's for people who want to do whatever they're gonna do to self monetize or and then.

497
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:13,999
Speaker 0: but if you want to self monetize you Got to pay for the account Yeah, or something and all the bandwidth and or you share revenue with YouTube or something like something like that.

498
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:19,400
Speaker 1: But well, we've talked about this before and I wanted to rail it because they take you down.

499
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,045
Speaker 0: There should be a way to complain.

500
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:22,811
Speaker 1: there isn't so we'll see how this goes.

501
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:32,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's time for things Of the day.

502
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:37,556
Speaker 1: so, you know, I like weird internet shit, I like shit posting like.

503
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:38,438
Speaker 1: I just enjoy that.

504
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:44,860
Speaker 1: I enjoy Consuming a certain type of shit posting on the internet, but like old-school shit posting.

505
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:52,040
Speaker 1: So I found this weird hole on the internet of you know, like Simpson wave became kind of its own thing.

506
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:56,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found a video that was called Simpsons old Jewish man posting

507
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,143
Speaker 0: Okay,

508
00:31:57,243 --> 00:32:12,000
Speaker 1: and it was very specifically scenes from the Simpsons and then they would Re-cut the audio or like composite the scene or do something to insert that one old Jewish grandpa Who dances once in one episode?

509
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,846
Speaker 1: Into the scene somehow.

510
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:16,739
Speaker 1: Okay, and It was moderately funny.

511
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:28,390
Speaker 1: but what stood out to me was the incredibly like high attention to detail and Craft that was put into this like this was whoever did this put way more effort effort than was warranted.

512
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,649
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't look like a long video, right?

513
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,086
Speaker 0: If you had some Adobe software, it's not too much work skilled at it.

514
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,110
Speaker 0: So I take me a while, but someone who was good at it would not take a while.

515
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:46,154
Speaker 1: I saw the one video and I thought maybe it was one of those situations Like I made one AMV and I put a lot of effort into it and I thought it was really good But I only made one.

516
00:32:46,174 --> 00:33:04,314
Speaker 1: I thought someone made this shit posting joke once but then I saw Simpsons old Jewish man shitpost or man posting two and three and then I found a ton of videos made by a bunch of different people that are different kinds of Simpsons something.

517
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:05,700
Speaker 0: they haven't been taken down.

518
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:18,369
Speaker 1: They haven't been taken down and they're all really really like high production value for the type of content that it is and They're way funnier than they should be like way funnier.

519
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:23,552
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna link to this one and I want to find out if you think this is funny as funny as I think it Is.

520
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:24,179
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

521
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,249
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

522
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:35,230
Speaker 0: So one of the original nerderies from even before the time of personal computers before the time of vidya games But even before the time of tabletop RPGs.

523
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:48,120
Speaker 0: You know back in the day if you were a nerd and the only things you had were maybe like miniatures war games like working on Cars or something collecting golden age comic books.

524
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:55,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that in those people didn't even really collect comic books in the golden Kids buying them and then throwing them out right.

525
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:59,963
Speaker 0: the collecting didn't happen till later really which is why golden aid comic books are rare and valuable.

526
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:07,810
Speaker 0: Back in those days the key nerdery what we would have been doing if we were alive then is model trains.

527
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:11,231
Speaker 0: Yep, model trains is like one of the core Nerderies.

528
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:15,885
Speaker 0: the word hacking comes from the MIT model train club because somebody said that.

529
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:23,550
Speaker 0: I don't know how true the story is But it's just story that's always told is that someone made a comment like ah those, you know, those train guys hacking away?

530
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:29,290
Speaker 0: Right, because when you're working on model trains all the electronics are underneath the train board, right?

531
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:36,545
Speaker 0: Where all the tracks are mounted and there's a whole bunch of wires and shit under there So you usually crawl under there and you hack away at all, you know shit.

532
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,989
Speaker 1: I was really into this as a kid.

533
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:44,250
Speaker 1: I had a whole bunch of big hardcover books that were like this instructional guides on how to do the train stuff.

534
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:45,835
Speaker 0: I had an oval train.

535
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,161
Speaker 0: we had a chain in a box.

536
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,130
Speaker 1: So we had some liquid smoke.

537
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:52,969
Speaker 1: We had a bunch of HO scale stuff, but that was just too small to work with and got him a pain in the ass.

538
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:59,210
Speaker 1: We had a really old set of O scale and I had one of those like triple track ones, right?

539
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,779
Speaker 0: So it's like Gundams.

540
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:08,190
Speaker 0: if you do Gundam gunpla They have they always measure things and how big it is compared to how big a real Gundam would be.

541
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,641
Speaker 0: So in Japan that giant Gundam, that's a 1-1 Gundam.

542
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:12,510
Speaker 0: That's how big a Gundam would be if it was real.

543
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:25,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, and when you make Gundams at home, you're usually doing like one one hundred one one thirty three Which means it needs to be a hundred or more times bigger than it is and then it would be the size of a real Gundam model trains have that same sort of scaling one slash number.

544
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like yeah If this was ten times bigger it would be the size of a real.

545
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:34,010
Speaker 1: well We just looked up the one because there's like O and HO and there's this whole system, but they have a system of letters.

546
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:37,801
Speaker 0: So it's like O. HO corresponds to numbers, right?

547
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:40,850
Speaker 1: So we looked up that's 1/5 scale, right?

548
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,490
Speaker 0: So Gundams sort of do something similar, but not exactly the same.

549
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:55,140
Speaker 0: We're like HG is 133 but so is RG but MG and NG are one hundred and like perfect grade of like 166 sometimes really big ones something like that.

550
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,304
Speaker 0: I don't remember the exact numbers.

551
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:58,310
Speaker 0: But yeah trains have the same thing.

552
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:06,360
Speaker 0: So HO is one of the sizes of train that is standard and usually if you're a train person All the trains you get are in the same scale.

553
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,690
Speaker 0: because then you all your tracks work with the same.

554
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,563
Speaker 0: All right, you get the tree all your trains link together, right?

555
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,049
Speaker 0: Your trees won't be too big.

556
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:13,973
Speaker 0: You're you're.

557
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:14,455
Speaker 0: you're.

558
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:16,784
Speaker 0: the station that you build would be the right size.

559
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:23,390
Speaker 0: if you mix the stuff together Then it just doesn't work like you have a giant fucking tree or a. really your track will be too small.

560
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,930
Speaker 0: All right, you want to buy all the stuff you buys in the same scale?

561
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:36,050
Speaker 1: I wonder I gotta see if I can find someone who does like really advanced craft in model trains, but Does it all in the wrong fucked up scale?

562
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,606
Speaker 1: So it looks weird and dystopian.

563
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:42,945
Speaker 0: anyway My thing of the day is a video a train video and this person in the HO scale train set.

564
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,129
Speaker 0: Is this Junji Ito?

565
00:36:45,715 --> 00:37:00,750
Speaker 0: they made Just not like the usual thing that people make with trains which is like a fancy set with all sorts of finely crafted You know towns and people and all no no into any that they just made a huge ass fucking spiral of track.

566
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:07,150
Speaker 1: Yeah They filled it with like the most basic sheep like coal and they made the longest fucking train.

567
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:23,470
Speaker 0: That pretty much fills up the whole goddamn spiral and it's sort of I don't know Hypnotic and calming and whatever to watch because it's just so, you know Interesting and and to look at this is perfect spiral this train going around at a constant speed.

568
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:32,249
Speaker 0: I think the most interesting thing is how many engines they had to intersperse between the coal cars To give it enough power to because one engine ain't pulling this train.

569
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:42,315
Speaker 1: You need a lot of engine Right to move all them cars depending on the scale because of the smaller scales like sometimes all the cars will have motive power Just for reasons.

570
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:46,792
Speaker 1: Yep depends, but this one looks like the trains themselves are motive and the cars are not There.

579
00:38:10,393 --> 00:38:14,209
Speaker 0: this is a person who owns a lot of HO track and train and goes nuts with it.

580
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:19,701
Speaker 1: So this is a hobby that as a kid I always wanted to get into and I like I'd make stuff and we had a little set.

581
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:27,936
Speaker 1: but as I got even a little Bit older it like it went from being really interesting to being Terrifyingly boring.

582
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:28,178
Speaker 1: my

583
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:43,850

00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,713
Speaker 0: so I Think they were.

585
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:49,690

Speaker 0: good news packs coming to a start and then this packs followed by packs and packs.

591
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have some news.

592
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,575
Speaker 1: Just booked my travel to packs.

593
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:07,996
Speaker 1: unplug.

594
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:16,716
Speaker 0: if you are going to PAX West to see or to see or not see us In 2019 in a couple few weeks Make sure you go and read.

595
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,884
Speaker 0: there are lots of changes logistically to PAX West.

596
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,870
Speaker 1: They have added a ton of bullshit security.

597
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:32,190
Speaker 0: Really fuck up your nose notable of which is a bunch of bullshit security And the consolidation of all tabletop stuff into the Hyatt Regency.

598
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:36,370
Speaker 1: We're gonna be in the Hyatt for almost the entire time that is right.

599
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:42,910
Speaker 0: Make sure you figure this stuff out before you go whether you or not you are a PAX veteran to get your shit together.

600
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:53,715
Speaker 1: I'm a little sad because like a lot of my nostalgia of packs is just memories of being in the WCC in that tabletop area with the good small rooms that were quiet Yep, and now we'll now.

601
00:39:53,755 --> 00:40:02,937
Speaker 1: basically I'm literally only gonna go into the WCC once Yep to do the expo hall video thing and then maybe not maybe Literally, that'll be the only time I go in.

602
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,017
Speaker 1: that also means I probably won't go to that bodega because there's no reason to go To that bodega unless you're in the WCC.

603
00:40:09,177 --> 00:40:10,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

604
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:29,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, if you are a Brave and normal person who realizes the security is all fake I highly urge you to complain to packs about this because based on a leak on a reddit It appears that it is read and the patent packs that wanted this fake security Not the city.

605
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:30,745
Speaker 1: No one forced this on them.

606
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:31,689
Speaker 0: They asked for this.

607
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:39,530
Speaker 1: Yep Which is a narrative that has people have tried to argue the opposite and we seem to have evidence that it is.

608
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,245
Speaker 1: In fact Reed wanted this unlike say Boston where Boston forced it on conventions.

609
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,148
Speaker 1: who did not want it.

610
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:48,038
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Thankfully magfest has none of this nonsense.

611
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,169
Speaker 0: Yep, and hopefully anyone at magfest.

612
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:55,910
Speaker 0: Yep I feel like if magfest afraid to go to I mean there are some reasons to be afraid to go to magfest.

613
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,650
Speaker 0: Honestly, if magfest instituted this you should be more afraid of creepy dudes just creeping at magfest.

614
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,010
Speaker 1: Then you are afraid of guns because magfest is a con that I go in and out of a lot.

615
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:08,450
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, if magfest added metal detectors, I would stop going to magfest.

616
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:09,996
Speaker 1: I literally I would just stop going.

617
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:14,553
Speaker 1: probably would not be willing to because I go in and out of magfest like 20 times in The course of a day.

618
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,295
Speaker 0: Yep packs.

619
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:18,647
Speaker 1: I tend to settle in the tabletop for like seven hours.

620
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,893
Speaker 1: Yep All right.

621
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:22,419
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some fruits.

622
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I tried to see if we did a fruit show.

623
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,810
Speaker 0: We probably did in rim deleted it, but we did do an Apple show way back in the day.

624
00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:30,250
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

625
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:37,151
Speaker 1: So we did a show on apples to apples the game and we did a show on apples on the fruit on November 13th 2014.

626
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:37,513
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

627
00:41:38,216 --> 00:41:39,260
Speaker 1: So we can.

628
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,810
Speaker 1: we are not allowed to talk about apples.

629
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:44,984
Speaker 0: I mean, we we obviously said everything we need to say about apples.

630
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,170
Speaker 1: So just assume New York.

631
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:47,585
Speaker 0: Apple is the thing in New York.

632
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:53,140
Speaker 1: Yeah And part of the reason why we're doing this show is that one People seem to really like it.

633
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,650
Speaker 1: when we do like food episodes.

634
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,839
Speaker 1: That's just like people love that and do.

635
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:04,426
Speaker 1: Scott did not want to do any my other show ideas Which include such things as let's rank American cities from best to worst.

636
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:05,510
Speaker 0: I haven't been to that many.

637
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:07,849
Speaker 1: Let's talk about when you should call the cops.

638
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:09,594
Speaker 0: Almost never.

639
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,301
Speaker 1: let's talk about being stolen from cuz.

640
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:12,743
Speaker 1: I've had a lot.

641
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:14,387
Speaker 1: I've had things stolen from me recently.

642
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,570
Speaker 0: All right locks.

643
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:19,349
Speaker 1: I feel like we could do a whole show just on cured fish.

644
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:22,096
Speaker 0: I don't ever need that many cured fish.

645
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:25,084
Speaker 1: spices good spices bad spices that cardamom.

646
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:26,548
Speaker 0: action fruits are better than spices.

647
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:30,940
Speaker 1: luggage The worst we've ever been on car accidents.

648
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:31,561
Speaker 0: Yeah.

649
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:33,266
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're gonna talk about fruit.

650
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:38,664
Speaker 1: Okay, so Scott What is your favorite fruit related joke in media?

651
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:39,266
Speaker 0: Why why?

652
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:39,849
Speaker 0: no, no, no, no.

653
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,960
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the actual fruits that you eat.

654
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:43,562
Speaker 0: right?

655
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,810
Speaker 0: melons, you know stone fruit.

656
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,965
Speaker 1: So I gotta get this out of the way cuz we have to.

657
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:51,902
Speaker 0: we've argued a lot I gotta say I gotta say something in general about all fruits.

658
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:56,601
Speaker 1: right it applies even to Apple I think not allowed to talk about Apple son.

659
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:01,637
Speaker 0: a lot of people out there right are You know have opinions, you know, they like some fruits.

660
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:02,439
Speaker 0: They don't like others.

661
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:02,700
Speaker 0: Right?

662
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:08,074
Speaker 0: The thing is just about every fruit is Delicious except for a few.

663
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:10,160
Speaker 0: and the thing is though.

664
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:11,204
Speaker 1: I think there are a lot of fruit.

665
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:11,926
Speaker 1: You have never eaten.

666
00:43:12,307 --> 00:43:14,196
Speaker 0: That's true also There.

667
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:18,717
Speaker 0: but any one of those delicious fruits Can be gross.

668
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:23,010
Speaker 0: a fruit is only delicious when it is at the correct level of ripeness.

669
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,649
Speaker 0: I don't think a lot of people

670
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:25,532
Speaker 1: form

671
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:41,954
Speaker 0: an opinion about a fruit when they eat one that is not a good example of that fruit and then are Unwilling, you know if it is actually depending on where they live may or may not be hard to get a good Version or variety of that fruit They go.

672
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:43,825
Speaker 0: Oh, I hate that fruit and they won't even eat it anymore.

673
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:44,590
Speaker 0: Cuz they're closed-minded.

674
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,733
Speaker 1: I think they don't.

675
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:50,766
Speaker 1: that has this to the highest degree of any fruit in the United States.

676
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,860
Speaker 1: is the pair the pair Absolutely the pair because a bad pair it tastes like sand.

677
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,241
Speaker 0: That's right.

678
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,410
Speaker 0: a pair that is not good basically tastes like nothing.

679
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:03,475
Speaker 0: It's just like you're eating fruit Cellulose material.

680
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,944
Speaker 1: this was even a long-form joke on.

681
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:12,890
Speaker 1: it's always sunny in Philadelphia Cuz there's a character Charlie who they're like on a road trip and it comes out that he has never had a page.

682
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,701
Speaker 1: He doesn't know what a pair is never heard of.

683
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:16,209
Speaker 1: a pair never eaten a pair.

684
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:20,508
Speaker 1: So they go to get him a pair and he just like oh and he's really excited.

685
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:20,910
Speaker 1: He bites it.

686
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:23,469
Speaker 1: He's like, uh, it just tastes like sand and nothing.

687
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:25,990
Speaker 1: And then there's this whole bit about oh, it's not right.

688
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:30,650
Speaker 1: Pears are real dangerous because I would argue that most pairs are bad.

689
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:33,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, most pairs are bad not varieties of pairs.

690
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:34,790
Speaker 1: all varieties of pairs are great.

691
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:39,565
Speaker 1: It's that most pairs are either not ripe overripe package poorly.

692
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:41,190
Speaker 1: They there's some problem with.

693
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:41,553
Speaker 0: Why is it?

694
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:42,379
Speaker 0: you get there hard?

695
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:43,950
Speaker 0: They're not juicy enough.

696
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:49,610
Speaker 1: Usually it's probably something was done to prevent them from ripening so they could ship them right and then they never like ripen.

697
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,653
Speaker 0: well that is that is.

698
00:44:50,673 --> 00:44:58,610
Speaker 0: the number one reason that people end up with bad fruits that don't taste good is because If you buy a fruit, let's say, you know a banana, right?

699
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:07,330
Speaker 0: What they do is that banana is grown way near the equator, right, you know If you don't live down in tropical areas, no bananas fucking growing in New York.

700
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,185
Speaker 0: Yes, you got some kind of crazy greenhouse set up for some shit, which I don't think anyone does.

701
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:12,430
Speaker 0: so they got to use chemicals.

702
00:45:14,352 --> 00:45:24,786
Speaker 0: They spray things right to trick the banana into ripening or not ripening and The result is that they ship the banana to you super green.

703
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:27,979
Speaker 0: then, you know It gets yellow and then it turns brown right away.

704
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:42,279
Speaker 0: You can actually do some tricks, you know Using these gases on your own if you can acquire them To you know control the ripening of the fruit like the old trip of putting in trick of putting an apple in a bag With certain other fruits things like that.

705
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:42,560
Speaker 1: Yep.

706
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,525
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of tricks.

707
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:43,806
Speaker 1: You can do.

708
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:44,510
Speaker 1: look at the fun line.

709
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,736
Speaker 0: We're not just that.

710
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:52,590
Speaker 0: it's simply because a fruit that travels Just loses flavor period regardless of how good it was to begin with.

711
00:45:52,771 --> 00:46:00,081
Speaker 0: If you go to Florida and you go to the grocery and get some pineapples It's like that came from a nearby pineapple place.

712
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:03,918
Speaker 0: if you go to Hawaii where there's a pineapple farm and eat a pineapple It's fucking delicious.

713
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,488
Speaker 0: See the same pineapple in New York.

714
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,598
Speaker 1: So usually what happens there?

715
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:09,784
Speaker 1: because there's two factors of play.

716
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:10,870
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty complex.

717
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:11,332
Speaker 1: I don't want to.

718
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,669
Speaker 1: I don't think we should try to get too deep into it because we are not experts in this.

719
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:21,950
Speaker 1: But on one hand these techniques end up giving you a very narrow window where it will actually be the right amount of ripe.

720
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:31,210
Speaker 1: So you can get a really good pineapple in New York But the odds of any given pineapple being at that moment of ripeness at the time you cut it up to eat it pretty low.

721
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,890
Speaker 0: I've actually learned how to tell when a pineapple is ready if it's all green obviously too soon.

722
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it's all brown, it's obviously mushy and bad.

723
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,790
Speaker 0: You want the pineapple because you know has a little like little hexagons.

724
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:46,903
Speaker 0: You want each hexagon to be brown with green around the edges.

725
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:49,530
Speaker 0: you want green on the edges and you want brown in the middle.

726
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:50,618
Speaker 0: And that's a pineapple.

727
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:51,968
Speaker 0: open that shit up eat it right now.

728
00:46:52,471 --> 00:47:01,564
Speaker 0: but every time I go to the grocery store in New York, the pineapples are either green usually green and Occasionally super brown super rare to find one that's in between.

729
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:03,050
Speaker 1: That's why I end up with pineapple.

730
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:06,225
Speaker 1: I tend to get a like package pre-cut pineapples.

731
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:07,190
Speaker 0: It's so much more money.

732
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:10,077
Speaker 1: If you buy a whole pineapple is four dollars.

733
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:14,850
Speaker 0: a tiny can of delicious canned pineapple will be like two or three dollars.

734
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:15,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

735
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:17,703
Speaker 0: It's like you put a whole pineapple for a dollar more.

736
00:47:17,723 --> 00:47:18,988
Speaker 0: if you can only find it's got it in my 30s.

737
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,261
Speaker 1: Wait a whole pineapple.

738
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:20,950
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be sick.

739
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,869
Speaker 0: I share I cut it up and I put it in a container and I eat it slowly or share it.

740
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:40,443
Speaker 1: No, but the other factor is that What constitutes a forgiven fruit is a really complicated question because there are a lot of Technically fruits We can head.

741
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:58,181
Speaker 1: that technically very We can head that off because and uh, if you go to the Wikipedia article just go there's a section it's the first section in the fruit page of Wikipedia that talks about the difference between Fruit as a botanic term and fruit as a culinary term.

742
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,083
Speaker 1: Haha.

743
00:47:59,204 --> 00:47:59,966
Speaker 1: We are saved.

744
00:47:59,986 --> 00:48:02,233
Speaker 0: we can avoid that fucking art Talking for that.

745
00:48:02,274 --> 00:48:04,022
Speaker 0: We are talking about culinary fruits.

746
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:05,750
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit about your botanic fruits.

747
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,736
Speaker 1: Here's the definition of culinary fruit.

748
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:12,230
Speaker 1: in case you want to be a pet in a fruit is usually any sweet tasting plant part.

749
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck.

750
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:14,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

751
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:16,133
Speaker 0: Take that full Definition.

752
00:48:16,153 --> 00:48:17,056
Speaker 0: stop me now.

753
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:19,222
Speaker 1: if it came off a sugary plant I eat it.

754
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:22,134
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, if it's even remotely sweet It's a fruit.

755
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:22,899
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

756
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:23,927
Speaker 0: Take that.

757
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:26,536
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, go fruits.

758
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:34,690
Speaker 1: All right, but with all these cultivars and everything What that means is that you look at ten different apples ten different sets of grapes.

759
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:40,708
Speaker 1: they could have drastically different tastes drastically different ripening periods everything.

760
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:49,170
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, and Generally the things that make a fruit easier to transport long distances tend to make it less flavorful.

761
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:54,449
Speaker 1: That's why the grapes you get in the grocery store are all like Concord grapes because they have a really thick skin.

762
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:55,550
Speaker 0: Oh, that's where we live.

763
00:48:55,672 --> 00:49:00,550
Speaker 1: They can make Concord grapes near here But also because they have a really thick skin and they're really easy to transport.

764
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:06,746
Speaker 1: But like the best grapes are the ones that have such thin skins that if you look at them the wrong way They just disintegrate.

765
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:21,001
Speaker 0: I think it's just part of the way that the history of you know fruit growing and generally, you know Agriculture in general is that they have been breeding, you know Things to you know have lots of features.

766
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:30,290
Speaker 0: right like doesn't get killed by bugs Grows real big, you know, you know stays in good shape and condition looks nice.

767
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:38,622
Speaker 0: they've been breeding for all these factors and Somehow flavor was not one of the factors that was emphasized in the u.s.

768
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:39,966
Speaker 0: In particular all the others.

769
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:45,630
Speaker 1: There was a trend to focus on Consistency over good flavor, right?

770
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:49,836
Speaker 0: So the result is that you know It's like they could and they probably.

771
00:49:49,896 --> 00:50:02,936
Speaker 0: there are people who probably are working on right cultivating fruits vegetables Whatever that have all the other good qualities like durable easy to grow Those Right Zima tomatoes or whatever.

772
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:07,270
Speaker 1: They're way more flavorful than just like red cherry tomatoes, but also tastes great.

773
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:21,350
Speaker 0: But the fact is most of the great tasting varieties of things that are grown Do not have those other features already bred into them and they end up being rarer more expensive can only get them locally.

774
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,918
Speaker 1: They end up being difficult to grow.

775
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:29,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried to grow a fancy strawberry and it didn't work out Shitty.

776
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:42,001
Speaker 1: Apparently, this is a big thing among people who grow cannabis like hobbyists because the really high quality cannabis plants They call them prima donnas because they're just.

777
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:43,487
Speaker 1: if anything goes wrong like fuck it.

778
00:50:43,547 --> 00:50:45,053
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna die I give up.

779
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:48,124
Speaker 1: but if you get a shitty cannabis plant, it's just invincible.

780
00:50:48,164 --> 00:50:49,650
Speaker 0: It's like the weed it makes us crappy.

781
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, the weed it makes us crappy.

782
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:51,442
Speaker 0: Like you don't want that.

783
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:52,669
Speaker 1: we fruits are the same way.

784
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:54,602
Speaker 0: Oh, I think all agriculture is the same.

785
00:50:54,662 --> 00:50:54,904
Speaker 0: Yep.

786
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:59,530
Speaker 0: That's just how it goes At least in terms of things we're eating or consuming like potatoes.

787
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:06,210
Speaker 1: We bred potatoes to be less poisonous so we can eat them But that makes them prone to being eaten by other animals and bugs and stuff.

788
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:12,456
Speaker 1: If you go in the wild and dig up like a random to mate like a random potato out in the woods It'll probably fucking kill you.

789
00:51:12,476 --> 00:51:14,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that was a rumor.

790
00:51:14,222 --> 00:51:16,229
Speaker 1: No wild potatoes are dangerous as shit.

791
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:21,689
Speaker 1: Anyway, lots of wild like things that look like carrots in the wild can be very toxic as well.

792
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,919
Speaker 1: Lots of wild or the worst are squashes.

793
00:51:25,441 --> 00:51:34,140
Speaker 1: if your garden if you're growing squashes in your garden The kinds of squashes we eat tend to taste really good But they you need to do a lot of care to make them grow.

794
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,092
Speaker 0: All right, so worst possible fruit Grapefruit.

795
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:39,636
Speaker 1: Well grapefruits are delicious.

796
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:41,161
Speaker 0: The fuck's wrong is the worst.

797
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:44,270
Speaker 1: free grapefruit juice is my favorite juice.

798
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:47,123
Speaker 0: Now a grapefruit is first of all granted.

799
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:48,570
Speaker 0: I'm even if it tasted good.

800
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:54,449
Speaker 1: Really have the the xkcd strip called quote fuck a grapefruit up on the screen right now?

801
00:51:56,172 --> 00:52:00,306
Speaker 1: No, okay, I'll talk about this chart in a minute cuz it's important.

802
00:52:00,426 --> 00:52:01,470
Speaker 0: so a grapefruit, right?

803
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,936
Speaker 0: Here's all the problems with a grapefruit number one.

804
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:03,478
Speaker 0: It tastes bad.

805
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:04,181
Speaker 1: It tastes delicious.

806
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,065
Speaker 1: Your is your.

807
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:06,070
Speaker 0: it is sour.

808
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,299
Speaker 1: Bad way it is sour in a wonderful way.

809
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:10,102
Speaker 0: I could eat a lemon.

810
00:52:10,182 --> 00:52:13,412
Speaker 0: I could eat a lime just um, but a grapefruit It's just like.

811
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:15,219
Speaker 0: it's like it's like acid.

812
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,725
Speaker 0: It's like burning nasty.

813
00:52:17,186 --> 00:52:18,130
Speaker 1: I think I battery.

814
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:22,170
Speaker 1: I think I could eat an entire grapefruit before you could eat an entire lemon.

815
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,170
Speaker 0: Alright, so second problem with grapefruit right is that it's kind of big.

816
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,244
Speaker 0: It's like an orange is a good size.

817
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:30,050
Speaker 0: I could eat a whole orange.

818
00:52:30,271 --> 00:52:33,061
Speaker 1: There are oranges that are as big as grapefruits.

819
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:35,690
Speaker 0: You don't eat those look like a navel orange a navel orange.

820
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:36,714
Speaker 0: I can eat a whole navel orange.

821
00:52:36,855 --> 00:52:38,642
Speaker 1: There's some grapefruits are about that size.

822
00:52:39,124 --> 00:52:40,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, grapefruits are too big.

823
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:41,937
Speaker 0: You can't eat the whole grapefruit.

824
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:44,910
Speaker 0: usually end up chopping it in half and the other half goes in the fridge.

825
00:52:45,153 --> 00:52:47,156
Speaker 0: It gets even more sour Right.

826
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:47,700
Speaker 0: All right.

827
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,597
Speaker 0: number three to eat a grapefruit You can't just like an orange.

828
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:52,889
Speaker 0: you can peel it and then break it into wedges and eat it.

829
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,712
Speaker 0: Yeah an apple.

830
00:52:53,732 --> 00:52:55,117
Speaker 0: you can just bomb into it.

831
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:58,769
Speaker 0: a banana peel it just on right a watermelon or a pineapple.

832
00:52:58,789 --> 00:52:59,130
Speaker 0: you cut it.

833
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,455
Speaker 1: Yeah to your credit.

834
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:00,756
Speaker 1: There is.

835
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:03,064
Speaker 1: there's a reason why there's a fruit you got.

836
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:04,570
Speaker 0: you need a fucking weird-ass spoon.

837
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,096
Speaker 0: There's a holy grandma has.

838
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,390
Speaker 1: there's a pop culture meme from the 80s that mostly disappeared.

839
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,238
Speaker 1: Like it's not in modern media really.

840
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:20,229
Speaker 1: if you watch old 80s movies old TV shows There will always be a joke about someone in the family is eating a grapefruit for breakfast and it squirts someone else in the

841
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:31,108
Speaker 0: eye Right and you use the grapefruit like sharp like serrated spoon and it'll still squirt you in the eye Right, which is the thing that really happens in a special spoon for this fucking fruit and only grandma

842
00:53:31,148 --> 00:53:31,570
Speaker 1: has one.

843
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,574
Speaker 1: All right, so Scott I'm gonna.

844
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:34,142
Speaker 1: actually I'm gonna almost agree with you.

845
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:35,710
Speaker 1: We are talking about fruit.

846
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:47,854
Speaker 1: We are not talking about fruit juice because and this gets me to this chart fruit juice Removes like there are fruits that are a pain in the ass to eat or prepare that Prickly pear.

847
00:53:47,874 --> 00:53:53,904
Speaker 1: that being said quickly pair one time delicious fruit And I will never try to prepare you again in my life.

848
00:53:54,125 --> 00:54:00,150
Speaker 0: that being said one time I went and I bought some orange juice and I didn't realize it was orange grapefruit juice and it tasted like poison.

849
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,673
Speaker 0: I threw it out.

850
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:02,784
Speaker 1: No grapefruit juice is delicious.

851
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
Speaker 1: No, but I'll agree with you here.

852
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:08,409
Speaker 1: I do not like to eat grapefruit as a fruit, but I love grapefruit juice.

853
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:12,410
Speaker 0: Yeah So this xkcd see me in a perfect one is grow.

854
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,818
Speaker 1: This is the most important thing to talk about fruit.

855
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:15,561
Speaker 1: We discount juice.

856
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:18,190
Speaker 1: This xkcd strip is called fuck grapefruit.

857
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:19,656
Speaker 0: Oh a wise person.

858
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:22,870
Speaker 0: Randall Monroe knows how great fruit is disgusting.

859
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:28,090
Speaker 1: But the important thing is this is the most important one Scott plus Randall Monroe versus rim.

860
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:35,885
Speaker 1: There are only two axes you to one for which you there only two axes to describe fruit.

861
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,353
Speaker 1: one axis is Difficulty.

862
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:40,683
Speaker 1: how easy it is it to prepare and eat?

863
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:42,530
Speaker 1: how difficult is it to prepare and eat?

864
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,485
Speaker 1: The other axis is is it tasty or is it on tasty?

865
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:47,530
Speaker 1: case in point?

866
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:53,890
Speaker 1: Seeded grapes very tasty but much more difficult to eat then unsee than seedless grapes.

867
00:54:54,331 --> 00:55:03,100
Speaker 1: Seedless grapes not as tasty but so much easier to eat that most people prefer seedless grapes Yeah, but like seedless watermelon.

868
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:14,260
Speaker 0: whenever I go to the grocery whenever I get grapes At the grocery is one of the only things at the grocery It's you're allowed to eat one of each color grape Yep at the grocery to test to see if they're good.

869
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,710
Speaker 0: and then if they're good then you buy great.

870
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:20,824
Speaker 0: Yeah But you can always eat one green grape and one red grape at the grocery to test them out.

871
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:25,564
Speaker 0: because this chart shows a lot Of times you go to the grocery you eat a great but it's like that's tasteless not buying those.

872
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:28,070
Speaker 1: but this chart then allows us To make four quadrants.

873
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,699
Speaker 1: So in the upper right quadrant are the magic fruit.

874
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:38,665
Speaker 1: the fruit are the tasty ones that are easy to eat and the king Of those on this chart is a combination of peaches strawberries and blueberries, right?

875
00:55:38,685 --> 00:55:40,250
Speaker 1: So I don't disagree with no.

876
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,578
Speaker 0: So the thing with peach though, it's like strawberry.

877
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:43,661
Speaker 0: It's like you can it's.

878
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,206
Speaker 0: you can kind of get good strawberries.

879
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:48,015
Speaker 1: Oh good peach Good peach.

880
00:55:48,256 --> 00:55:50,630
Speaker 0: if you live in Georgia, you're just like buried in them, right?

881
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,360
Speaker 0: You can just get them all over in New York.

882
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,030
Speaker 0: It's hard to get good peach.

883
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,724
Speaker 1: Oh my if I get a good if I get a peach as a rock.

884
00:55:56,925 --> 00:55:59,194
Speaker 1: and when I say this good It goes when I say peach.

885
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:00,218
Speaker 0: I don't just mean peach.

886
00:56:00,378 --> 00:56:03,830
Speaker 0: I mean all varieties of peach white peach yellow peach, California peach.

887
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:05,680
Speaker 0: I mean nectarine, which is just a peach.

888
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,363
Speaker 0: It's not fuzzy.

889
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:07,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean plum.

890
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:08,674
Speaker 0: I mean pretty much.

891
00:56:08,874 --> 00:56:10,018
Speaker 0: all those are not peaches.

892
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:14,836
Speaker 0: all of the I know but I mean all the same things all those stone fruits Okay, so yes, I do.

893
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,024
Speaker 0: all of those have the same problem there.

894
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:23,170
Speaker 0: I when you go to the grocery in New York they're either hard as a fucking rock or mushy and disgusting.

895
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:27,350
Speaker 0: If you take one home that's hard as a rock.

896
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:33,530
Speaker 0: You have to sit there and look at it and wait for it to be a little squishy then eat it immediately and the second One you bought will already be mush.

897
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,882
Speaker 1: No and whenever you say look at it you have to literally just sit in the room with it and wait if you like leave the Room to go to the bathroom.

898
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:39,309
Speaker 1: We come back.

899
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:41,399
Speaker 0: No pile of mold.

900
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:43,809
Speaker 0: So I buy one at a time and I wait for it to be good.

901
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:44,491
Speaker 1: now I eat it.

902
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:46,739
Speaker 1: So this is where Randall Monroe made a mistake.

903
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,304
Speaker 1: There is a third axis.

904
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:49,648
Speaker 1: The axes is risk.

905
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:52,118
Speaker 1: How risky is this fruit?

906
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:55,150
Speaker 0: Yep, so I fruit and then well it goes bad.

907
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:55,753
Speaker 0: You just lost it.

908
00:56:55,913 --> 00:57:02,269
Speaker 1: and if you take risk into account or even if it doesn't go bad like grapes They don't really go bad so much as some grapes are just bitter.

909
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:05,765
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, those are bad, but you don't you don't risk it cuz you taste like.

910
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:06,870
Speaker 1: oh they got like it.

911
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,265
Speaker 0: So taste them before you buy them.

912
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:14,290
Speaker 1: Yeah But as a result, but strawberries tend to just be good or rotten, but they tend to be good a lot longer.

913
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:16,297
Speaker 0: I've heard about a special strawberry.

914
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:17,582
Speaker 0: That's like the best driver.

915
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,610
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw people tweeting about that the other day.

916
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,595
Speaker 0: Well, no, that was a melon.

917
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:21,640
Speaker 0: They were tweeting about.

918
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:23,410
Speaker 1: I also saw people tweeting about the melon.

919
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:27,086
Speaker 1: I didn't see strawberry the head the heirloom melon that has gone from this earth.

920
00:57:27,126 --> 00:57:28,130
Speaker 1: and there's another melon.

921
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,598
Speaker 1: That's the closest thing you can get to it.

922
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:30,182
Speaker 1: Yes.

923
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:31,368
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to get that melon.

924
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,904
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I was thinking about that kind of like how they gross me Cal.

925
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:34,810
Speaker 1: It's hard to get.

926
00:57:35,112 --> 00:57:37,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's what old bananas taste like.

927
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:40,777
Speaker 1: Yep Bananas are complicated because bananas are pretty good.

928
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:41,359
Speaker 1: They're not great.

929
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:42,041
Speaker 0: I love banana.

930
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:42,863
Speaker 1: I like bananas.

931
00:57:42,923 --> 00:57:46,536
Speaker 1: Okay, I actually prefer plantains But that doesn't count as fruit.

932
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:48,627
Speaker 0: It depends because that is something I just eat.

933
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:49,210
Speaker 0: a fucking plan.

934
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,678
Speaker 1: Plantain is something you cook that is savory.

935
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,570
Speaker 1: It does not count because we were talking about botanical fruit whatever.

936
00:57:56,794 --> 00:57:57,989
Speaker 1: So what about the melons?

937
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,040
Speaker 0: There's a lot of good melons out because I was talking.

938
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,340
Speaker 1: I was at work literally a couple days ago because where I work You know money melon.

939
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:08,057
Speaker 1: every morning There's just four cups of fruit for anyone who wants them.

940
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:12,509
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and bring me home for those people that I talked to hate honeydew.

941
00:58:13,132 --> 00:58:17,454
Speaker 1: Okay, like people don't like honeydew and I don't understand why the money I mean honeydew.

942
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:22,448
Speaker 1: the money melon is a great melon, but I think the problem is honeydew is like other.

943
00:58:22,508 --> 00:58:23,150
Speaker 1: it's like pears.

944
00:58:23,472 --> 00:58:24,661
Speaker 1: Most people have bad honeydews.

945
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:28,112
Speaker 0: That's also true But I do think you know It is.

946
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:35,541
Speaker 0: even though a good even a good honeydew the flavor of the good honeydew is not Powerful right handy if you get a really ripe one.

947
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,810
Speaker 0: Yes, but it's mostly a milder fruit.

948
00:58:38,272 --> 00:58:42,550
Speaker 0: So when you eat it, even if it's you know, it's it's like alright, I taste delicious honeydew.

949
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,182
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, most honeydews are not the most delicious.

950
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:48,530
Speaker 0: They're often a little firm and tough.

951
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:56,290
Speaker 0: They don't like Like say watermelon or cute or even cantaloupe, but if you get a good honeydew, it's a strong flavor.

952
00:58:56,835 --> 00:58:58,290
Speaker 1: It just melts in your mouth.

953
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:02,341
Speaker 0: Most people not had a good honeydew and even the best honeydew.

954
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:04,006
Speaker 0: It's like it's great.

955
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:04,928
Speaker 0: It's the money melon.

956
00:59:04,989 --> 00:59:10,650
Speaker 0: I want it I want to eat it Yeah, but it's just not it like if it can put the best honeydew in the best cantaloupe and the best watermelon.

957
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:12,397
Speaker 0: The honeydew is less powerful.

958
00:59:12,497 --> 00:59:13,240
Speaker 0: It's less sweet.

959
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,589
Speaker 0: It's less delicious less sugary, you know.

960
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:20,230
Speaker 1: Watermelon is interesting because it doesn't have that strong a flavor either.

961
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,501
Speaker 1: But what I like about watermelon is I can just eat.

962
00:59:22,762 --> 00:59:27,521
Speaker 1: well good watermelon has a strong flavor Yeah, but you can eat as much what you could just eat watermelon forever.

963
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,227
Speaker 0: Well, it's mostly water exactly.

964
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:29,749
Speaker 0: He's got a fee.

965
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:32,858
Speaker 0: That's why it's mushier than the honeydew.

966
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,390
Speaker 1: I have an anecdote from when I was a young child.

967
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,606
Speaker 1: I was like six or seven years old maybe younger.

968
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:38,150
Speaker 1: I don't know.

969
00:59:39,352 --> 00:59:40,679
Speaker 1: I could try to figure out how old I was.

970
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:46,949
Speaker 1: But basically we had a Gigantic watermelon like a huge one and we cut the whole thing up.

971
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:48,830
Speaker 0: sure He doesn't remember it being big cuz you were small.

972
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:49,355
Speaker 1: No, it was.

973
00:59:49,416 --> 00:59:58,800
Speaker 1: it was big like the whole thing Like we were talking about like this is a big watermelon like, uh-huh so anyway, the per that what it was all this man was I Basically ate the whole fucking thing.

974
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:06,389
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and the family I kind of mad at me cuz I like literally just ate the whole thing Over the course of like the morning and I kept having to pee.

975
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,298
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I had to pee so much that I kept going.

976
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:28,630
Speaker 1: I went to the bathroom peed again and again and again and again cuz I Basically drank like a gallon and a half of watermelon juice And I was young and at some point apparently I started crying Because I was peeing so much that I thought I was gonna pee forever And I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go play with my friends anymore because I kept having to pee.

977
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:30,759
Speaker 0: Just go play in the pool and pee.

978
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might have worked.

979
01:00:32,386 --> 01:00:33,872
Speaker 1: I didn't think about that I didn't.

980
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:35,236
Speaker 0: I was playing the ocean and pee.

981
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:38,949
Speaker 1: kid brain couldn't figure out that I should just go stay in the pool all day.

982
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:43,190
Speaker 1: Kid brain just kept crying and going back into the bathroom and peeing.

983
01:00:44,393 --> 01:00:45,265
Speaker 0: Bring a big ring game boy.

984
01:00:45,285 --> 01:00:45,386
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:53,790
Speaker 1: But I think actually if I have to say my favorite fruit It is not as easy to eat as say strawberries peaches seedless grapes.

986
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:57,483
Speaker 1: But the mango mangoes good.

987
01:00:57,503 --> 01:00:58,426
Speaker 1: I love the mango.

988
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,470
Speaker 1: I'll just eat mangoes all day.

989
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:05,730
Speaker 1: Mmm, the problem is the best mangoes are the ones you get right off a tree in a tropical place.

990
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:07,244
Speaker 1: we don't have access to those.

991
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:09,879
Speaker 1: or For the grocery store by us.

992
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:12,090
Speaker 1: every now and then they'll have champagne mangoes.

993
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:13,838
Speaker 1: They're really good.

994
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,228
Speaker 1: They rot instantly.

995
01:01:16,432 --> 01:01:17,518
Speaker 1: It's not like ripe.

996
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:24,789
Speaker 1: It's not like rock ripe a badge Like if they're in the grocery store, they're always ripe and they will be bad by the end of that day.

997
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:30,950
Speaker 1: So if you ever see champagne mangoes in the grocery store, just buy them and eat them all that night.

998
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:33,664
Speaker 0: It's hard for me to have a favorite fruit because it's like.

999
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:38,082
Speaker 0: there's so many delicious fruits I love whichever one is in season and high quality, right?

1000
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:40,230
Speaker 0: It's like I'm not you know, it's like I love fucking Apple.

1001
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:41,058
Speaker 0: It's Apple season.

1002
01:01:41,078 --> 01:01:42,370
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, give me all the Apple.

1003
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:52,148
Speaker 0: But then it's like, you know if I'm sitting there in the summer and it's like, okay Here's an apple and then here is you know an in-season like fucking strawberry.

1004
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:52,730
Speaker 0: That's perfect.

1005
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,300
Speaker 0: It's like oh, I don't want the fucking Apple.

1006
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:55,750
Speaker 1: That is one thing I took with fruit.

1007
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:01,030
Speaker 1: I tend to eat seasonally and I tend to avoid out of season fruit, even though I could get them.

1008
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,198
Speaker 1: I live in New York and get any fruit.

1009
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:07,930
Speaker 1: I want just about if you spend money Yeah, but even then like I tend to like to eat the things that are most in season.

1010
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:11,650
Speaker 1: So like when it's blackberry season, I'm just eating blackberries in the winter.

1011
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,617
Speaker 1: I'm eating whatever fruits you can get in the winter.

1012
01:02:13,899 --> 01:02:14,400
Speaker 0: Another fruit.

Speaker 1: they're soaked in the sweet like.

1052
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,650
Speaker 1: they're basically like the cherries you'd put on a Sunday.

1053
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:44,936
Speaker 1: They're just the fancy version of that.

1054
01:03:45,177 --> 01:03:47,102
Speaker 1: Okay, they're not it's only.

1055
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:51,994
Speaker 0: the only ones I don't like are the red ones in their Unprocessed form.

1056
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:57,349
Speaker 1: No, I do really like pomegranates But they're too much of a pain in the ass.

1057
01:03:58,091 --> 01:03:59,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do pomegranate.

1058
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:02,150
Speaker 0: when someone else does the pain in the ass someone else does the pomegranating.

1059
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:06,306
Speaker 1: I will eat the pomegranates, but I'm not willing to do the pomegranating myself anymore.

1060
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:09,241
Speaker 1: Yeah Prickly pear is the same deal like.

1061
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:13,930
Speaker 1: I'll just eat prickly pear But someone else has to make it for me and no one is willing to do that.

1062
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:17,545
Speaker 0: Another fruit that I don't like that everyone else seems to love is the lychee.

1063
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:18,710
Speaker 1: Lychee is delicious.

1064
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,463
Speaker 1: It's got someone just brought up the lychee in the forum in the live stream.

Speaker 0: Oh interesting like she's really good.

1066
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,110
Speaker 0: Everyone else seems to love lychee, but I'm not into it.

1067
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:29,964
Speaker 1: The thing is the lychee is one of those fruits kind of like pear.

1068
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:31,170
Speaker 0: It tastes too much like a flower.
