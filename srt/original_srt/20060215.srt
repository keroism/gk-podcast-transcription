1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,830
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 15th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,090
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Rescue Wings and Kagekara Mamoru.

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,748
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:23,690
Speaker 0: So I almost didn't end up going to Katsu-kan, but it looks like that was resolved just now.

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,250
Speaker 1: Well you still haven't gone yet, we don't know what can happen.

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,608
Speaker 0: No I'm going no matter what.

7
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:28,330
Speaker 1: Really?

8
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:29,610
Speaker 0: Unless I die or something.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,730
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, we don't know.

10
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:31,358
Speaker 0: Yeah.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,550
Speaker 0: But uh, yeah for anyone who follows the forums, one of the main reasons we were going is that, well at least me and everyone else, the other Scott.

12
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:42,570
Speaker 0: See I have two Scott's, I have this Scott, and then I have a real Scott who lives in Pennsylvania.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,050
Speaker 1: No I'm the real Scott, the other one is the other Scott.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,488
Speaker 0: Yeah the other Scott came first you know.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,024
Speaker 1: Uh, I guess into the world, yes.

16
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:52,970
Speaker 0: So yeah he's also the one who gave us Cowboy Bebop.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,470
Speaker 1: Mhm, that's true.

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:03,410
Speaker 0: But anyway, we were going to see our friend Bruce who was in the Navy, and was going to take three weeks of leave just to go to this con and then hang out with his family for a while.

19
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:11,110
Speaker 0: And the Navy fucked him, and now he's staying in London or wherever the hell he is, doing nothing.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,790
Speaker 1: Isn't he on some fancy aircraft carrier or submarine or something?

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,268
Speaker 0: Nah he's in Europe somewhere right now.

22
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,086
Speaker 1: Oh alright.

23
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,889
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly what he's doing, he doesn't really tell us.

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,389
Speaker 1: It's a magic army scary secret science.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,805
Speaker 0: Well Navy.

26
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,589
Speaker 1: Or just something completely mundane and stupid, we don't know.

27
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:32,510
Speaker 0: Yeah but he's stuck because the Navy sucks and they took away his leave, they told us just now.

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,390
Speaker 0: But whatever, I'm still going to be at Katsucon, I hope to see at least one or two of you kids out there.

29
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:42,130
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that's why I'm glad I didn't join any militaries.

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in real news, opera's coming out on the DS.

31
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,905
Speaker 1: Opera the web browser, not the...

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,890
Speaker 0: Not the things put on by impresarios for my amusement after giving them money, dressing up fancily and sitting there with tiny little glasses.

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, not big fat vikings ladies with helmets and bitchforks and such.

34
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,250
Speaker 0: Have you ever actually seen an opera, Scott?

35
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,267
Speaker 1: Yeah I have.

36
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:08,889
Speaker 0: Not many of them involve vikings.

37
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,630
Speaker 1: Yes, but you know what, actually I saw the Romeo and Juliet in Italian, the opera, in Lincoln Center.

38
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:18,830
Speaker 1: And if I would have stayed and bought tickets to the show at night, you know what the show at night was?

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,930
Speaker 0: God or Dammerung?

40
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:20,928
Speaker 1: The vikings.

41
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,239
Speaker 0: Oh, what do you mean?

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,808
Speaker 0: the vikings?

43
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,185
Speaker 1: That thing you just said.

44
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,590
Speaker 0: God or Dammerung is the fourth part of the Ring Cycle.

45
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,689
Speaker 1: I don't know, it's one of the viking ones.

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,647
Speaker 0: The Wagner ones?

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,330
Speaker 1: I don't know, but there was a poster outside that had a big fat viking lady on it with a helmet holding the pitchfork in the air.

48
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,930
Speaker 1: It was so hilarious because it was exactly like all the stereotypes.

49
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:42,189
Speaker 1: It was just great.

50
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:46,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I'm not going to get into my views on opera, because I really like opera.

51
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,290
Speaker 0: But suffice to say, I don't like Wagner and I think his Ring Cycle.

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:59,110
Speaker 0: While the storyline and the material and all the ideas behind it are awesome, the actual operas are crap.

53
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,109
Speaker 0: But anyway.

54
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,827
Speaker 1: Kill the web, babe.

55
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:02,303
Speaker 0: Yeah.

56
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,104
Speaker 1: All right.

57
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,809
Speaker 0: But yeah, web browser, fully wireless enabled, obviously, on the DS.

58
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,990
Speaker 1: I like how it'll have, I saw some pictures.

59
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,930
Speaker 1: I like how you can browse a page on one screen and browse another page on the other screen.

60
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,490
Speaker 0: Yep, or they're talking about how they'll have a zoomed in view on the top screen.

61
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,030
Speaker 0: And like a meta map view with a box that you can drag around to show what part you're zoomed in on at any given time.

62
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,048
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

63
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,670
Speaker 1: The thing I only wonder is typing in URLs might be painful.

64
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll imagine, you know what, I would just set up a web page to go to and set it as my home page.

65
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,029
Speaker 0: And that web page would have links on it.

66
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kinda hackish, though.

67
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:43,249
Speaker 1: Not everyone can do that.

68
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what, everyone else can go to hell.

69
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,110
Speaker 0: Well... I don't have my music yet, but at this point I would play my "Rim Doesn't Give a Shit" song.

70
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,949
Speaker 1: Great, you're gonna play that just constantly.

71
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:52,990
Speaker 0: I don't care about much.

72
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,350
Speaker 1: You might as well just play it for 40 minutes and make that the show.

73
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:56,729
Speaker 0: I don't care about much.

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,470
Speaker 1: Well, see, the thing is, number one, they might have bookmarks in the software itself.

75
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:05,130
Speaker 1: Which is okay, because you just type them in once and you're good.

76
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,505
Speaker 1: And you're not gonna really use the DS too often.

77
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,350
Speaker 1: I mean, what would I bookmark?

78
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,050
Speaker 1: Google, Gmail, Wikipedia, you know.

79
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:12,789
Speaker 0: Fark/dot.

80
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are the kind of things that you would whip out a DS to browse in the net for.

81
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,810
Speaker 1: You're not gonna do heavy browsing on it no matter what.

82
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,867
Speaker 1: You're gonna do, "Oh crap, I need to check

83
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:20,250
Speaker 1: something!".

84
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,222
Speaker 1: Or, you know, "Is that true?

85
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:22,967
Speaker 1: Let's find

86
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:23,168
Speaker 1: out!".

87
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,010
Speaker 1: Whip out your DS, find out, you know.

88
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:34,370
Speaker 1: But, what I would like is if I could go onto a computer somewhere and make my bookmarks using my keyboard somewhere.

89
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,306
Speaker 1: And then that would load it into the DS, you know, over the internet.

90
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:39,250
Speaker 1: That would be extra cool.

91
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,790
Speaker 0: I see a lot of reasons why that's not gonna happen.

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,510
Speaker 1: Why not?

93
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,090
Speaker 0: Because that is still too technical for a lot of people.

94
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,370
Speaker 1: Well, no, they just, if you want, you can visit the Opera DS website and manage your bookmarks and such.

95
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:52,824
Speaker 1: You know.

96
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:54,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

97
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,509
Speaker 1: You can even visit it with the DS.

98
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,282
Speaker 0: I just don't see anything like that happening.

99
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,570
Speaker 0: I think it's just gonna be the web browser.

100
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:02,010
Speaker 0: I mean, look, there isn't even any storage in the DS.

101
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:06,309
Speaker 0: So you're gonna get some tiny piddly amount of cash on the cartridge and that's it.

102
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,810
Speaker 1: I don't even think you're really gonna have cash at all.

103
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,510
Speaker 1: It's just so much money extra for something you don't really need.

104
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,770
Speaker 1: Because you're not doing heavy browsing with it.

105
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,429
Speaker 1: If you're doing heavy browsing with it, what's wrong with you?

106
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,250
Speaker 0: A small amount of caching is still very useful, even for light browsing.

107
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think that it makes the thing so much more expensive that it's almost not worth buying.

108
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,828
Speaker 1: That's what it really comes down to.

109
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,790
Speaker 0: I mean, we don't know what this is gonna cost either.

110
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,492
Speaker 1: Mhm.

111
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:32,384
Speaker 1: I imagine it'll be like thirty bucks as a DS game, right?

112
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

113
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,030
Speaker 0: I'd like to see it for fifteen.

114
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,618
Speaker 1: I would also like to see it for fifteen.

115
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,429
Speaker 1: I would probably buy it for fifteen no matter what.

116
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:45,450
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's really a question of, you're gonna have to buy it on a DS cartridge.

117
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,010
Speaker 1: It's not free or anything.

118
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:56,609
Speaker 1: So, is it good enough and useful enough as a web browser to meet the needs of what you would use it for, being a web browser on the DS?

119
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,463
Speaker 0: And there's no way to really answer that question.

120
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:01,590
Speaker 0: We'll just have to wait and see.

121
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's coming for sure.

122
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,553
Speaker 0: Which is a good thing.

123
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:09,470
Speaker 0: I'd like to see a wave of actually useful applications in addition to the games for the DS.

124
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:10,429
Speaker 1: Yeah.

125
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:17,970
Speaker 0: I'd really like to see a PDF cartridge, a PDA cartridge, maybe calendaring, all that sorts of useful stuff.

126
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:20,670
Speaker 0: Maybe a scientific graphing calculator cartridge.

127
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's the thing.

128
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,385
Speaker 1: I have all that stuff in my Blackberry.

129
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:24,170
Speaker 1: I don't even use it.

130
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:24,993
Speaker 0: I don't, yeah.

131
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,058
Speaker 0: It'd be nice to have.

132
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,530
Speaker 0: I would probably have a PDA thing, at least for work.

133
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:30,394
Speaker 1: I wouldn't use it.

134
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:34,170
Speaker 1: I don't really, you know, I've had that sort of stuff before, and I've never used it.

135
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,489
Speaker 1: So I just, now I don't care.

136
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I had a PDA, IBM gave me one for free a long time ago, and I used it every now and then.

137
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,510
Speaker 0: I didn't use it like some people do, you know?

138
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,610
Speaker 0: You know those people who can't live without their PDA, and everything in the world is in there?

139
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:49,687
Speaker 0: And if they lose it, they just die and don't know...

140
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,096
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

141
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,670
Speaker 1: The new trend is to have moleskines.

142
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:56,489
Speaker 1: You gotta have a moleskine.

143
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,613
Speaker 0: Alright, yeah, you know what?

144
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:02,108
Speaker 0: You've told me about that, and those lifehackers, you're all a little silly.

145
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:02,650
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

146
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, do you have such a problem with your brain that you just can't remember what you have to do?

147
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,850
Speaker 1: So you have to organize it using a special system and a special notebook with a fancy name.

148
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:21,390
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's just, I'm not one to call things pretentious, but god damn it, lifehackers are pretentious.

150
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,374
Speaker 1: You know what?

151
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:23,546
Speaker 1: It's really fun to say

152
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:23,869
Speaker 1: "moleskine.".

153
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:25,499
Speaker 0: You know what?

154
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,169
Speaker 0: It's a moleskine.

155
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,031
Speaker 1: That's right.

156
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:32,828
Speaker 1: They actually told a story, like, you know, one guy was like, "What if I wanted to get a moleskine?

157
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:33,209
Speaker 1: What would I

158
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:33,369
Speaker 1: do?".

159
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,138
Speaker 1: Go to Staples and say, "Oh, do you have any

160
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,021
Speaker 1: moleskines?".

161
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:38,064
Speaker 1: And the guy would be like, "What?

162
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,890
Speaker 1: What are you talking

163
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,010
Speaker 1: about?".

164
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,244
Speaker 1: "Oh, you mean the moleskines?

165
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:42,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're over

166
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:42,990
Speaker 1: there.".

167
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,842
Speaker 0: "Yeah, you can watch some of that there, rootna, and have a good ol' time.

168
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:48,087
Speaker 0: Get 'er

169
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:48,308
Speaker 0: done.".

170
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

171
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:49,450
Speaker 0: Oh.

172
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,250
Speaker 0: Not even, yeah, whatever.

173
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:50,570
Speaker 1: Yeah.

174
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:55,250
Speaker 1: So the DS is also going to have a TV tuner, which is cool because the Game Gear had a TV tuner.

175
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wanted it for the longest time when I was a kid.

176
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,250
Speaker 0: My parents never bought it for me, and my life was no different as a result.

177
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only time I ever saw the Game Gear TV tuner, some kid at summer camp had it.

178
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,550
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, summer camp is pretty much the only use for the Game Gear TV tuner, because there are no TVs anywhere.

179
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:19,867
Speaker 1: So you turn that on, and there's anything on the TV for like five minutes, which is about how long the battery lasted, and it was like,

180
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:20,348
Speaker 1: "Whoo-hoo!".

181
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:21,546
Speaker 1: And that was it.

182
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:28,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember my grandma, my grandparents had a conversion van, and like this is when I was, I don't know, five or six.

183
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:36,549
Speaker 0: And they gutted the inside, and they put like a couch kind of thing in there, and they put a TV, and there's a big antenna, and we could watch TV while we were driving.

184
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:45,330
Speaker 0: We learned at that point that you can't watch TV while you're driving, because if you're on a trip, the channels change immediately and get blocked by things, and it's just worthless.

185
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:56,730
Speaker 1: I remember my cousins had a big van, and they had a little tiny TV in that van, and you know, we used it, I, you know, watched TV on it maybe two or three times in my life.

186
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:08,350
Speaker 1: I think the only actual use we got out of it, where the signal stayed going, was when there was a football game, and we like went out to get some food and then come back with it.

187
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,590
Speaker 1: And the football game managed to come in, in between their house and the food place.

188
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,645
Speaker 0: We usually occasionally stop somewhere, but...

189
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's much better when you stop.

190
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:25,009
Speaker 1: But yeah, DS, TV tuner, I'm probably not going to get it, mostly because I don't watch TV.

191
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,930
Speaker 1: And as soon as they switch to digital TV, it's going to be completely useless anyway.

192
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,370
Speaker 0: I didn't even think of that.

193
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, come on.

194
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,589
Speaker 0: You know what, we're never going to switch to digital TV.

195
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,270
Speaker 1: No, that's for sure.

196
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,889
Speaker 1: I mean, wait, wait, what are we going to switch to digital TV from?

197
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:40,927
Speaker 1: No TV?

198
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,428
Speaker 1: We can switch from no TV to no TV.

199
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,830
Speaker 0: Well, I point out that the nation hasn't switched to digital TV.

200
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,749
Speaker 0: No one really wants it, except the industry people who want to make money off of it.

201
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,298
Speaker 1: Yep.

202
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:53,781
Speaker 1: Oh well.

203
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, in other news, vaguely related to TV, in the movies, I'm sure you've all heard of Uwe Ball.

204
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,158
Speaker 1: I actually hadn't heard of him.

205
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:04,249
Speaker 1: I saw the name around, I wasn't sure who it was.

206
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:14,310
Speaker 0: When I first heard the name, and just the internet itself kind of coalesced, and I got this feeling that whoever he was, I probably didn't like him.

207
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,690
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the same thing, because I saw this name, Uwe Ball.

208
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:21,409
Speaker 1: And then I was like, who's Uwe Ball, and why do they keep mentioning him?

209
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:23,709
Speaker 1: And they kept saying bad things about him.

210
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,689
Speaker 1: So I was like, this might be a bad guy, because all the websites that I know are run by good guys say Uwe Ball's a bad guy.

211
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:36,670
Speaker 0: Well, he is the person responsible for every bad video game movie you've ever seen.

212
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,198
Speaker 1: Well no, that's not true.

213
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,949
Speaker 1: Every video game movie is bad.

214
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:45,170
Speaker 1: So, he's not responsible for all of them.

215
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,170
Speaker 1: He's responsible for the majority of the recent ones.

216
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the new ones.

217
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,769
Speaker 0: Every time you see a video game movie advertised, he's the one who made it.

218
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:52,710
Speaker 1: Yep.

219
00:10:54,331 --> 00:11:00,030
Speaker 0: He's, regardless of the fact that he's making these bad movies, he's just a terrible director and a terrible guy.

220
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:01,574
Speaker 0: Everyone hates him.

221
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:06,870
Speaker 0: And the story here is that he recently discovered how much everyone hates him.

222
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,950
Speaker 1: Well, we don't know how recently he discovered it, but he recently acted on this discovery.

223
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,106
Speaker 0: He basically was interviewed and starts whining about, "Everyone hates me, and they all suck, and

224
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:17,608
Speaker 0: bleh.".

225
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:22,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like, that's it, I'm not gonna, fine, I'm not gonna make any more video game movies.

226
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,510
Speaker 1: Now everyone can shut up.

227
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,110
Speaker 0: And you know what, the world screened for joy.

228
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:32,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he, I think the other thing he said is that Peter Jackson and the Halo movie are gonna suck.

229
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,670
Speaker 0: You know what, I think Peter Jackson could make the Halo movie awesome, and I think he will.

230
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:47,390
Speaker 1: Uh, you know what, I think the problem is the Halo movie is gonna suck, and Peter Jackson has contributed his name to it, but he's not actually the director or anything.

231
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,170
Speaker 1: He's just like the guy who puts his name on it and gives some money.

232
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,430
Speaker 0: Oh really, so he's just a producer or what?

233
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

234
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,050
Speaker 0: Oh great, never mind, I take back everything I just said.

235
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus, I don't, every video game movie ever has sucked.

236
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,270
Speaker 1: What is, what reason is there to believe this one won't?

237
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,210
Speaker 0: Hey, hey, hey, Wizard was a masterpiece.

238
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,349
Speaker 1: No it wasn't.

239
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,570
Speaker 0: Wizard bought my world.

240
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:12,329
Speaker 1: Alright, you ready?

241
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,010
Speaker 1: I dare you to watch it right now, and then honestly say that without laughing.

242
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:22,790
Speaker 0: Uh, Fred Savage is awesome, and uh, yeah.

243
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's so bad.

244
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,989
Speaker 0: Now that, my friends, was an inside joke.

245
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,570
Speaker 1: Not very inside, it's- You know what, I have a feeling that all the- It's inside, anyone who's cool knows exactly what that joke was.

246
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the gamers out there laughing, and the rest of you, don't worry about it, it doesn't matter.

247
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,461
Speaker 0: Just forget it, forget.

248
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,170
Speaker 0: we said anything.

249
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,070
Speaker 1: You know how you can tell if someone's cool?

250
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,948
Speaker 0: If you're listening to this podcast with someone, and they just yelled, "He's grabbing my breast, oh my

251
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:54,369
Speaker 0: god!"

252
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,850
Speaker 0: I was gonna yell that, but you beat me to it.

253
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,129
Speaker 1: Then that's a cool person.

254
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:00,503
Speaker 1: If you're saying, "What the

255
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:00,866
Speaker 1: hell?"

256
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,589
Speaker 1: You're not old school, no matter what you think.

257
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,285
Speaker 0: I'll point out that the actual quote is, "He touched my

258
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:06,888
Speaker 0: breast!".

259
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:10,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess I'm not perfect old school.

260
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,230
Speaker 0: Followed by an accusatory Phoenix Wright finger.

261
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:16,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you have no idea what the hell we're talking about, you're not old school no matter what you think.

262
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,210
Speaker 1: That's the old school test, everybody.

263
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,429
Speaker 0: Well, at one level, I mean, there are people older school than us.

264
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:23,309
Speaker 1: Of course.

265
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,109
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the Atari types.

266
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, people who, uh, fought for the, you know, the gold chalice.

267
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,809
Speaker 0: Oh my god, get this freaking duck away from me.

268
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:35,170
Speaker 0: Alright, it's not video game day, so we're gonna stop with that.

269
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,429
Speaker 1: We are gonna stop with that, Uwe Ball sucks.

270
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,729
Speaker 0: So, things of the day.

271
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,062
Speaker 0: You know, we already had music.

272
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:50,029
Speaker 0: It played just now.

273
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,449
Speaker 1: Well, now we've added a little more.

274
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,005
Speaker 0: Alright.

275
00:13:52,891 --> 00:13:58,550
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if you know what I know, but I know that I like Eurobeat music.

276
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, he likes it a little too much.

277
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,410
Speaker 1: Well, I like all kinds of music.

278
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,590
Speaker 1: Eurobeat is just a obscure type of music that I like.

279
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,170
Speaker 1: It's made in Italy and popular in Japan.

280
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:15,090
Speaker 0: Yep, it got really popular in the anime-con scene in the United States for about two years.

281
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,630
Speaker 0: Like, super, super popular, and then it disappeared.

282
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,250
Speaker 1: Well, that's because it was associated with these para-para dancing girls.

283
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:29,747
Speaker 0: Yep, which themselves were vaguely associated with Initial D, and it all kinda came together into this, "Oh my god, para-para's awesome, what the fuck is

284
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,249
Speaker 0: para-para?".

285
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:37,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, Eurobeat, para-para, Initial D, Avex, The Record Company, all these things combined were sort of this thing.

286
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:49,489
Speaker 1: And it's a genre of music that's sort of like hyper, high-energy, electronic, singing girls, sometimes singing guys, music that I like some of it.

287
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:58,010
Speaker 0: So that is basically Eurobeat.

288
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,050
Speaker 1: In case you never heard it before, that's the kind of music we're talking about.

289
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:12,450
Speaker 1: Now, the thing of the day here is a new and recent music video of a remix of an old and good and popular Eurobeat song called "Night of Fire" by NYKO, N-I-K-O.

290
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, "Night of Fire" is probably one of the most recognized, most well-known para-para Eurobeat-style songs.

291
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,510
Speaker 1: And it's a pretty good one, so it's a well-deserved knowing.

292
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,649
Speaker 1: So, the weird thing about this video that makes it crazy, which kinda made my head spin...

293
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:31,570
Speaker 0: One, it's done by that new pop idol whatever group.

294
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:32,709
Speaker 1: Called Hinoy.

295
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,684
Speaker 0: Or Hanoi.

296
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:34,649
Speaker 0: Whatever.

297
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,729
Speaker 1: And two, there's this weird fat guy in the video.

298
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,690
Speaker 1: Later, I found out that's a pro wrestler from Japan.

299
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,155
Speaker 0: God.

300
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,410
Speaker 1: And you know what I think about pro wrestling.

301
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,350
Speaker 1: You know, two barely-clothed guys grabbing each other.

302
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,824
Speaker 0: Hey, there's nothing wrong with homoerotic verbs.

303
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,797
Speaker 1: Nope, there aren't.

304
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,029
Speaker 1: But it's not my bag.

305
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:55,748
Speaker 0: It's not your bag!

306
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,249
Speaker 1: Definitely the opposite of my bag.

307
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:00,349
Speaker 0: Must I remind you of the yaoi couch?

308
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:03,970
Speaker 1: The yaoi couch is the opposite bag of pro wrestling.

309
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, see it's funny.

310
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:08,729
Speaker 0: We've mentioned the yaoi couch a lot on this show.

311
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,090
Speaker 0: And the only reason a lot of people haven't asked us about it is that the people who would have the balls to ask already know.

312
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,288
Speaker 0: 'Cause they know us.

313
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,649
Speaker 1: And the people who... other people don't know what yaoi is.

314
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is anime day, so I figure it's fair game.

315
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:25,270
Speaker 0: If you don't know what yaoi is, just never mind.

316
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,789
Speaker 0: Y-A-O-I.

317
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, just Google it.

318
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,590
Speaker 1: Be careful on Google.

319
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,810
Speaker 0: Just Google Image for it.

320
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:30,965
Speaker 0: I think you're really gonna like it.

321
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:37,830
Speaker 0: Now, one day, I mean, we're all... well, we're not all heterosexual in our social group.

322
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,410
Speaker 0: But the two of us are very heterosexual.

323
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:42,370
Speaker 0: Not a hundred percent.

324
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:43,669
Speaker 1: No one's a hundred percent.

325
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no such thing as a hundred percent, and I defy you to say other, but whatever.

326
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,729
Speaker 1: This is even a test that can prove it.

327
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:49,393
Speaker 0: Yeah.

328
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,749
Speaker 0: But anyway, we're not gay.

329
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,510
Speaker 0: However, we're very secure in our sexuality.

330
00:16:55,631 --> 00:17:00,770
Speaker 0: As a result, one day, we were at a friend's house, and there were, like, ten guys there, and, like, two girls.

331
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,610
Speaker 0: And we're all trying to fight to sit on the couch.

332
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:05,185
Speaker 0: And someone yelled "Yaoi

333
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:05,509
Speaker 0: couch!".

334
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,689
Speaker 0: And we all jumped on the couch and fought, and that was it.

335
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:13,069
Speaker 0: That's really the whole origin story of the yaoi couch idea.

336
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:14,750
Speaker 1: Bunch of guys in a couch.

337
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, if a bunch of guys are sitting on a couch, someone yells "Yaoi

338
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:17,750
Speaker 0: couch!".

339
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,249
Speaker 0: We all laugh, and that's the end of that.

340
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:24,450
Speaker 1: So anyway, there's a weird pro wrestler guy, and he's breathing fire.

341
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,174
Speaker 1: I get it.

342
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:25,961
Speaker 1: Night of fire.

343
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:26,769
Speaker 1: Ha ha ha ha ha.

344
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,615
Speaker 1: What's his name?

345
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,150
Speaker 1: Koriki, I think the guy's name was?

346
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:29,768
Speaker 0: Something like that.

347
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,151
Speaker 0: Yeah.

348
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,708
Speaker 1: I didn't even know he was a pro wrestler until just now, and I did my research on it.

349
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:43,650
Speaker 1: And, you know, so it's kinda silly that someone made a serious music video to a Eurobeat song, and included a crazy wrestling guy in it.

350
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,409
Speaker 0: And it comes out-- I don't know how serious this video actually is.

351
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,710
Speaker 1: It was on MTV Japan, and on their website, the guy is on the cover of their album.

352
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I imagine they know it's funny.

353
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,090
Speaker 1: I think that what they're trying to do is promote this pop group using the already popular wrestler guy.

354
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,650
Speaker 0: I could see that being the case.

355
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:13,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I mean, the guys who are the age of pro wrestling watching are generally also the age, especially silly pro wrestling watching, are also the age of pop idol liking.

356
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,276
Speaker 1: But, here's the scarier thing.

357
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:21,490
Speaker 1: Watch this video, and then come back to this and listen to what I'm about to say.

358
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:25,009
Speaker 1: Those girls, you know what year they were born in?

359
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,116
Speaker 0: Don't say it.

360
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,309
Speaker 0: This frightened me.

361
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,955
Speaker 1: Nineteen.

362
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,270
Speaker 1: Ninety.

363
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:31,852
Speaker 1: Ah!

364
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,212
Speaker 1: Two.

365
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:34,398
Speaker 1: And one.

366
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:34,438
Speaker 1: 1991.

367
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,121
Speaker 1: Or '92.

368
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:37,572
Speaker 0: '57.

369
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:37,754
Speaker 0: Or '58.

370
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:40,094
Speaker 1: But no, '91.

371
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:40,415
Speaker 1: Or '92.

372
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:41,600
Speaker 1: They're 13 and 14 years old.

373
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,769
Speaker 0: What the hell.

374
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,610
Speaker 1: And when I first watched it, I thought that they were like 20-something year olds.

375
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,933
Speaker 0: Of course, remember way back.

376
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:56,910
Speaker 0: we went to the New York Tokyo Music Festival, and Boa was on stage doing a couple of songs.

377
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:58,901
Speaker 0: And she was like 13 back then.

378
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,512
Speaker 1: Yup.

379
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:02,127
Speaker 1: No, she was 16 then, I think.

380
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:02,872
Speaker 0: No?

381
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,550
Speaker 0: Oh, she started when she was 13.

382
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she was 16 when we saw her, and now she's actually a normal age.

383
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:09,016
Speaker 0: Yeah.

384
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,004
Speaker 1: She's like 19, 20-something.

385
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,120
Speaker 0: I don't know what to think about this.

386
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,270
Speaker 1: She's actually doing cool stuff now.

387
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,578
Speaker 0: But these girls look like they're our age.

388
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:14,679
Speaker 0: Yeah.

389
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,358
Speaker 0: Maybe a little younger.

390
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,132
Speaker 0: Like, 22.

391
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,084
Speaker 1: Very scary, anyway.

392
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:20,549
Speaker 0: Yeah.

393
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,663
Speaker 1: But, yeah, Boa's doing some video game music now.

394
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,710
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty cool, actually.

395
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,315
Speaker 0: Not really.

396
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:24,903
Speaker 0: I hadn't heard that.

397
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:25,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

398
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,530
Speaker 0: I haven't heard Boa in a while.

399
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:27,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's still around.

400
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:28,530
Speaker 1: She's still popular.

401
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:32,990
Speaker 1: I think she's doing some video game because they want it to be popular in Korea and Japan.

402
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, because she can sing in like nine languages.

403
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:41,570
Speaker 1: Well, no, she's Korean, but she can speak perfect Japanese and English and sing all three perfectly, also.

404
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:41,911
Speaker 0: Yup.

405
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,210
Speaker 0: She can also, I've read that she can sing in other languages.

406
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,409
Speaker 0: Like, she can pick up, she might not understand the language, but she can sing in it.

407
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,828
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, lots of people can do that.

408
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,010
Speaker 1: But she actually is fluent, like, perfect at speaking English, Japanese, and Korean.

409
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,355
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,670
Speaker 1: And she's also hot and musically talented.

411
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:58,572
Speaker 0: Yup.

412
00:19:58,934 --> 00:19:59,397
Speaker 0: We saw her.

413
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:01,210
Speaker 0: We were about four feet away from her.

414
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,189
Speaker 0: We were probably the only gaijin in that entire concert.

415
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,750
Speaker 1: It was the other nerdy otaku guy there with his girlfriend.

416
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,122
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

417
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:09,230
Speaker 0: Everyone else was just- The bartender.

418
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, the bartender.

419
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,149
Speaker 1: The other bartender.

420
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:21,109
Speaker 0: I mean, remember when the one woman went up on stage, and she was trying to yell at the crowd some directions, and she didn't know enough English to do it, so she just yelled it in Japanese, and we didn't know what to do.

421
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:21,877
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

422
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:22,386
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

423
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

424
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,049
Speaker 1: That's fine.

425
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, that festival doesn't exist anymore.

426
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:27,526
Speaker 0: No.

427
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:29,430
Speaker 0: It only lasted a year and a half.

428
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:30,441
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

429
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:31,669
Speaker 1: Anyway.

430
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:40,570
Speaker 0: So, my thing, for anyone who knows me, I'm a big fan of blimps and dirgibles and that sort of thing.

431
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,387
Speaker 1: Zeppelins?

432
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, airships.

433
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,266
Speaker 1: Zeppelins?

434
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,588
Speaker 0: Well, for a long time- That Zeppelins?

435
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,550
Speaker 0: I have always- Yeah, I'm also a fan of, you know, rock.

436
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:50,903
Speaker 1: But- Roll?

437
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:52,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, rock roll.

438
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,210
Speaker 0: That is rolling rocks.

439
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,022
Speaker 1: Metal.

440
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:55,508
Speaker 0: Stones.

441
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:55,880
Speaker 1: Okay.

442
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,445
Speaker 1: Okay.

443
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:56,569
Speaker 0: Yeah.

444
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,490
Speaker 0: So you take God, and you roll him in some batter, and you make an inside joke.

445
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:03,077
Speaker 1: Yep.

446
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:06,004
Speaker 0: All right, we're done.

447
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:06,549
Speaker 0: We're done with that.

448
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,070
Speaker 1: It's Inside Joke Day.

449
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,210
Speaker 0: It is Inside Joke Day, because also there's going to be no podcast tomorrow.

450
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,535
Speaker 1: Yep.

451
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:11,968
Speaker 1: You know what?

452
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:15,190
Speaker 1: When you're done talking about your thing of the day, I got the greatest inside joke.

453
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:15,870
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

454
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:17,270
Speaker 1: As long as you don't come out with it first.

455
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,722
Speaker 1: Okay.

456
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:26,890
Speaker 0: So I'm a big fan of blimps, and it really bothers me that this technology was pretty much abandoned.

457
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:33,769
Speaker 0: Because actually, blimps are an incredibly efficient way to move large amounts of cargo long distances.

458
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about how much a blimp can carry, like a giant freaking blimp, versus how much a 747 can carry.

459
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:52,149
Speaker 0: I mean, imagine quite literally making a small warehouse, filling it with stuff, having a blimp pick it up, slowly drift in the air currents, over the ocean, land, and now you have a warehouse full of stuff, ready to go.

460
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,768
Speaker 1: Much better than a train, even.

461
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:02,229
Speaker 1: A train has to take all the stuff out of the warehouse, put it into little cargo containers, zoom it on a train, and then take them all off and unload them.

462
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,790
Speaker 1: With the blimp, it might go a little bit slower, but it doesn't go slow at all.

463
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:08,009
Speaker 1: It's pretty damn fast.

464
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,950
Speaker 1: It's not as fast as a train or a plane, but it's still fast enough.

465
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:15,210
Speaker 1: And you move so much cargo per unit time.

466
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:16,689
Speaker 0: Also, it's so cheap.

467
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,110
Speaker 1: It's like more bandwidth.

468
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:30,270
Speaker 1: Like, sure, it might be a lot easier to send something over the network, but putting a DVD on the back of a turtle gets you more data per unit time, you know?

469
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,610
Speaker 0: Well, depending on the network.

470
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,410
Speaker 1: Depending on the distance, also, and the network.

471
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,249
Speaker 1: But you get what I'm saying, a blimp is like that.

472
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:37,970
Speaker 1: It's slower miles per hour.

473
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:43,670
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of people have a lot of misconceptions about blimps, because they see the old video of the Hindenburg burning.

474
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,464
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

475
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,587
Speaker 1: Oh, the huge manatee.

476
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,347
Speaker 0: Yeah.

477
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:48,469
Speaker 1: There you go.

478
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,829
Speaker 0: That was your inside joke?

479
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

480
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

481
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:53,567
Speaker 0: Oh, the huge manatee.

482
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:02,205
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go into great detail, because this is a thing of the day as opposed to a news bit, but basically the Hindenburg, the hydrogen in it didn't really burn.

483
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,950
Speaker 0: It just flashed up and disappeared.

484
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:13,450
Speaker 0: All that horrible fire was caused by the fact that they effectively painted the Hindenburg with a substance that we know today as rocket fuel.

485
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,125
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

486
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,910
Speaker 0: And modern blimps are actually very safe.

487
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,570
Speaker 0: And the thing I'm linking to is, imagine a cruise ship that's actually a blimp and flies.

488
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:24,807
Speaker 0: Yep.

489
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,128
Speaker 0: It's not a full blimp.

490
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:35,448
Speaker 0: The hydrogen in it only supports, I think, two-thirds of its weight, and then it has big turbines and engines to supply the rest, and it actually produces lift with little wing-a-lings.

491
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:36,888
Speaker 1: Wing-a-ling-a-lings?

492
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:41,550
Speaker 0: If these things ever get made, I would seriously consider going on a trip in one.

493
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be much better than going on a trip on a cruise boat.

494
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,989
Speaker 0: I mean, it goes a little under 200 miles an hour.

495
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:49,430
Speaker 0: It has a range of just thousands and thousands and thousands of miles.

496
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:51,770
Speaker 0: It could just probably circumnavigate the Earth.

497
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,470
Speaker 1: Probably.

498
00:23:54,451 --> 00:24:04,408
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, it's like, if anyone's questioning the safety of blimps, I'd just like to point to the MetLife blimps and all those other blimps they use for sporting events and things.

499
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:06,829
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen one of those go down?

500
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,528
Speaker 0: Ever?

501
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:13,390
Speaker 0: I would like to point out just to the fact of how many planes crash, or how many people die in car accidents, blimps aren't that dangerous.

502
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:15,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, blimps don't go down.

503
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:17,489
Speaker 1: They just float there.

504
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,246
Speaker 1: That's like, "Oh, riding on a balloon is

505
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:20,710
Speaker 1: dangerous."

506
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:22,450
Speaker 1: It's not dangerous at all.

507
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:23,510
Speaker 1: It's pretty much guaranteed.

508
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,930
Speaker 0: Actually, ballooning is really dangerous.

509
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,470
Speaker 1: Well, ballooning is only because you're not protected by anything.

510
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:29,142
Speaker 0: Yeah.

511
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:36,650
Speaker 1: Imagine if someone did precise ballooning, like all the balloons were perfectly evenly spaced in science and everything.

512
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:38,228
Speaker 1: That's what a blimp is.

513
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:52,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically, I think that as time goes on, people are going to start using blimps and this technology more and more as they realize that it is a very efficient way to do things, even though it may seem old or crappy to people who don't know better.

514
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,890
Speaker 1: We should just start a blimp company and make a lot of money.

515
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:59,090
Speaker 1: And anyone who uses us will be able to destroy their competitors.

516
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,589
Speaker 0: All right, let's do that.

517
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,309
Speaker 0: Forget geek nights.

518
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the last episode.

519
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:02,907
Speaker 0: We're done.

520
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,726
Speaker 0: We're making blimps now.

521
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,599
Speaker 0: Woo-hoo.

522
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:06,188
Speaker 1: Not blimpies.

523
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,869
Speaker 0: All right, so it's anime day.

524
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,868
Speaker 0: And we watch two shows, as we always do.

525
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,050
Speaker 1: Two pretty new-looking shows, I think.

526
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, one was pretty good.

527
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,708
Speaker 0: We're not really sure where it's going to go.

528
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,950
Speaker 1: Because it was pretty slow.

529
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,070
Speaker 0: One was the most generic anime I've ever seen.

530
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,109
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that one first.

531
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,710
Speaker 1: It's called Kagekara Mamoru.

532
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,390
Speaker 0: Kagekara Mamoru.

533
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:29,000
Speaker 1: Yes.

534
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:36,430
Speaker 0: It's basically, all right, it starts out with some robbers being beat by a ninja.

535
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:36,877
Speaker 0: Yep.

536
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:37,669
Speaker 0: Whatever.

537
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:44,089
Speaker 0: Then it cuts to, it's the first day of school, and the lazy girl is getting up and going to school.

538
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,268
Speaker 1: The clumsy girl.

539
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,089
Speaker 0: Oh, the clumsy girl.

540
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:47,510
Speaker 0: I think the boy's lazy.

541
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,449
Speaker 1: The boy's lazy.

542
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,749
Speaker 1: He has the squirrely, circular glasses.

543
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fanboy glasses.

544
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,449
Speaker 1: And he's lazy and tired.

545
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:56,370
Speaker 0: And oh, it's the first day of school, we don't want to be late.

546
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,830
Speaker 0: And they go, and he's actually a ninja.

547
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:02,910
Speaker 0: And she's just whiny and dumb and clumsy.

548
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:07,387
Speaker 1: The story is that his family has been protecting her family for 400 years.

549
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,290
Speaker 1: So he protects her from all the dangers of everyday life.

550
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,970
Speaker 1: And of course, they go to a bowling alley.

551
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,450
Speaker 0: And there's freaking Yakuza selling counterfeit dolls.

552
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,070
Speaker 1: And she gets kidnapped, so he beats up this comic Yakuza boss.

553
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:24,690
Speaker 1: And there's another third character who's a girl.

554
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,290
Speaker 0: We think she's a lesbian or something.

555
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,050
Speaker 1: Or she has the hots for the ninja kid.

556
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,988
Speaker 0: It's hard to tell.

557
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:38,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you have any idea of a stereotype of what an anime is, think of all the stereotypes.

558
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,868
Speaker 1: You know, big eyes, small mouth, cute little animal, ninja.

559
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:44,849
Speaker 1: Every single one of those is this show.

560
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,770
Speaker 1: This is the stereotypical anime.

561
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,110
Speaker 0: It's basically a mahou shounen slash crap fest.

562
00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:02,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you've never seen the default anime before, just watch one episode of this and go, "Oh, that's the default

563
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:02,429
Speaker 1: anime.".

564
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:06,410
Speaker 0: I mean, this is about as original as the original season of Sailor Moon.

565
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,668
Speaker 0: In fact, probably less so.

566
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,750
Speaker 0: Also, it's very low budget.

567
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,610
Speaker 0: You'll note if you watch the episode, they don't animate shit.

568
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:17,689
Speaker 1: They animate some stuff.

569
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:18,710
Speaker 0: Almost nothing.

570
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,150
Speaker 1: But what they do animate is pretty much just standard, modern animation.

571
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,150
Speaker 1: Nothing fancy, nothing...

572
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,270
Speaker 0: People standing there talking, people standing there walking, someone bowling.

573
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:27,746
Speaker 1: Yup.

574
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:32,788
Speaker 0: And then whenever there's a fight, it's always like there's a ninja and a bunch of yakuza with guns standing there.

575
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,889
Speaker 0: The door slowly closes in shots, you hear a bunch of noises, then it cuts inside the room and all the yakuza are beat up.

576
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:39,850
Speaker 1: Exactly.

577
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,949
Speaker 1: A lot of times they'll do the trick where you see a solid picture and they pan up or they pan across.

578
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,829
Speaker 0: There's this one where he's standing there and they pan up his leg and then they pan in from the side.

579
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,330
Speaker 0: Then they pan in from the other side.

580
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,668
Speaker 0: They pan in like six times.

581
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:54,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

582
00:27:54,931 --> 00:28:00,669
Speaker 1: Or they'll like cut to the picture really quickly and put some sparkles on it and make a noise.

583
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,410
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll make the picture vibrate a little.

584
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,998
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

585
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,430
Speaker 0: Yeah.

586
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,710
Speaker 0: The show's not worth watching.

587
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,990
Speaker 1: I would say it's worth watching one episode if you've never seen a plain old anime before.

588
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,490
Speaker 1: But other than that, don't bother.

589
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,308
Speaker 0: It has one funny scene.

590
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:19,590
Speaker 1: What scene was that?

591
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,310
Speaker 0: When she was bowling.

592
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,250
Speaker 1: Oh, when she was getting gutter balls?

593
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:22,579
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,149
Speaker 0: There's one funny scene in the show.

595
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,469
Speaker 0: If you watch it up until she gets her last gutter ball, you're done with it.

596
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,053
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

597
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,790
Speaker 0: And maybe it's funny that the yakuza guy has a giant gatling gun in his desk.

598
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:37,790
Speaker 1: No, because I've seen that a thousand times before.

599
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,029
Speaker 1: That exact same thing.

600
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,389
Speaker 0: I've never seen it with a gatling gun.

601
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:42,630
Speaker 1: I've seen it with a gatling gun.

602
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,548
Speaker 0: In what show?

603
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:44,530
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

604
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:44,975
Speaker 0: Yeah.

605
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,969
Speaker 0: Extraordinary claim.

606
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,128
Speaker 0: Extraordinary evidence.

607
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,610
Speaker 1: I bet you, I guarantee you I can find another gatling gun under a desk.

608
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:53,990
Speaker 0: Not under a desk, in a desk.

609
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:54,889
Speaker 1: Alright, in a desk.

610
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,150
Speaker 0: As in I hit a button and the desk opens up and provides to me a gatling gun.

611
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:00,749
Speaker 1: I can find one of those for sure.

612
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:01,570
Speaker 0: Alright.

613
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,390
Speaker 1: I think, yeah, you might even find one in like Trigun or something.

614
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:04,703
Speaker 1: I don't know.

615
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,669
Speaker 0: So then we watched an actual show.

616
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,809
Speaker 1: Well, I just wanted one more warning about the previous show.

617
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:20,310
Speaker 1: Whatever you do, don't let someone who's new to anime or has prejudice against anime watch that show because it will prove everything they believe right.

618
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:22,030
Speaker 0: Good call.

619
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,369
Speaker 0: This show is kind of crap.

620
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,330
Speaker 1: It's only useful for a small bit of silliness if you already have seen it.

621
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:37,690
Speaker 0: This may sound dumb, but I guess it's only really for, you know, generic young fanboy fangirls or maybe the advanced anime palette.

622
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:43,969
Speaker 0: You know, someone who's seen everything and when they see some generic crap anime, they see it for what it is and laugh at it for what it is.

623
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:45,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

624
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:51,115
Speaker 1: I guess you might not have seen a generic crap anime before, so now you can say, "Oh, they do

625
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:51,502
Speaker 1: exist.".

626
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot of them.

627
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,130
Speaker 1: I'm having a hard time of thinking of another show so generic and stereotypical.

628
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:58,027
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon.

629
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,408
Speaker 1: Somewhat.

630
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,370
Speaker 0: Early Sailor Moon, at least, the first season.

631
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:02,330
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, maybe.

632
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,049
Speaker 1: I think maybe, see, I want to say like Jubei-chan, but Jubei-chan was actually a better show.

633
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:08,650
Speaker 0: Eh, Kagehime.

634
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:11,910
Speaker 1: Alright, Kagehime is not stereotypical.

635
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,850
Speaker 0: It pretty much is, aside from the horrible, uh, yeah.

636
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:17,230
Speaker 1: But it's not generic, also.

637
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,010
Speaker 1: You see what I'm saying?

638
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,290
Speaker 1: It's fairly generic.

639
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,130
Speaker 0: Magical Girls.

640
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,710
Speaker 0: It's a Magical Girls show, but it's not- They take a historical thing and they toss it in just to have some kind of plot.

641
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,530
Speaker 0: But a Magical Girls- They could replace Lewis Carroll with anything and it would have still worked.

642
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,750
Speaker 1: But a Magical Girls show is not as generic as Ninja by Night, Schoolgirl by Day.

643
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,910
Speaker 0: You realize that's the same as a Magical Girls show.

644
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,990
Speaker 0: It's just, uh, shounen, or mahou shounen, you know, Magical Boy instead.

645
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,110
Speaker 0: There's a whole genre of mahou shounen out there.

646
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.

647
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,928
Speaker 0: Alright, eh, we watched a real anime too.

648
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:50,129
Speaker 0: I'd rather talk about that.

649
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,528
Speaker 1: Alright, let's talk about the real show.

650
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,330
Speaker 0: It's called Rescue Wings, or, uh, Yomi Gairu Sara.

651
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,269
Speaker 1: Rescue Wings.

652
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:57,870
Speaker 0: Yes.

653
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:04,210
Speaker 1: So, it's about this guy, and he starts out, he's obviously on train, train, right?

654
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:05,369
Speaker 1: Going to a new town.

655
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,888
Speaker 0: Yep, he's got gifts with him.

656
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:17,630
Speaker 1: So obviously he's moving, you find that out pretty soon, and you find out that he's in the JSDF, and he's going, he's been positioned in this new place.

657
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:32,205
Speaker 1: Then you find out along the way that he doesn't really know his way around town, and he's having a hard time getting in contact with his girlfriend, like, she won't, she doesn't pick up her phone, and he doesn't, he's not home to get his phone, he doesn't have a cell phone.

658
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:36,050
Speaker 1: So he's having a little relationship trouble with the long distance types.

659
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,629
Speaker 1: You know, his family's, you know, a normal kind of family.

660
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:41,909
Speaker 1: But they're far away also.

661
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:43,068
Speaker 1: They worry about him.

662
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,527
Speaker 0: And it's just, it's really slow, and it's really atmospheric, but the atmosphere is really boring.

663
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:59,390
Speaker 0: It's just a mundane kind of, look, he's going to the store, look, his clothes, things didn't arrive yet, he's sleeping on the floor, look, he's going to work on his bike, look, he wanted to be a fighter jet pilot.

664
00:31:59,775 --> 00:31:59,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

665
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,750
Speaker 0: It's just really, really bland and slow.

666
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:12,830
Speaker 1: I think the point of the show is that there's going to be, they're setting you up for, like, you know, normal, like, real life drama and occupational drama.

667
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:24,910
Speaker 1: I think if we watch more episodes, that the occupational drama will be exciting, because the plot is that he wanted to be a fighter pilot, he didn't get to be a fighter pilot, instead he got assigned to being a rescue helicopter.

668
00:32:25,191 --> 00:32:27,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, the equivalent of, like, the Coast Guard types in the US.

669
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:33,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone who goes around in helicopters and picks people up in floods and, you know, earthquakes and whatnot.

670
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:40,650
Speaker 1: There's an earthquake in the show, and then that's where he gets called in to actually do some rescuing, even though he's still a noob, or, you know.

671
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:46,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically nothing happens in the first episode, so it's hard to say where the show's going to go and if it's going to be good.

672
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,461
Speaker 1: Yeah.

673
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:53,776
Speaker 1: I think I would watch it up until they actually start doing some rescuing to see if it is awesome enough.

674
00:32:53,816 --> 00:33:03,790
Speaker 1: when they do that, because that would be the awesome part of the show, is the stuff that happens during the rescuing and the relationships between him and the other rescue people.

675
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll definitely get some of that camaraderie humor we like.

676
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:11,390
Speaker 0: Like in Stand Alone Complex with Batou and all them, or the mechanics in Last Exile.

677
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,542
Speaker 1: There's also some camaraderie conflict, because the one guy's like, "You suck, you just want to be a fighter

678
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:15,830
Speaker 1: pilot.".

679
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:21,090
Speaker 1: And it's true, but I think along the show part of the story is going to be how he decides.

680
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:22,630
Speaker 1: being a rescue guy is also awesome.

681
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,207
Speaker 0: Oh, you think?

682
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,149
Speaker 0: You know, I never would have guessed that.

683
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,779
Speaker 1: You know what, I'm 100% sure.

684
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,160
Speaker 0: You know, no, I thought the show was going to be.

685
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,550
Speaker 0: he still wants to be a fighter pilot and he hates his life and eventually he either becomes one or kills himself.

686
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:33,750
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

687
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:34,048
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:35,590
Speaker 1: Maybe that's how it turns out and it's awesome.

689
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,950
Speaker 0: Oh, it also has the best friend from Academy who got to be a fighter pilot who was in the same base and he's jealous.

690
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:41,836
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,869
Speaker 0: And he thinks the kid looks down on him and the kid kind of does look down on him.

692
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,733
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

693
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, um, wow.

694
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:49,990
Speaker 0: It was just, it was really slow.

695
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,210
Speaker 0: I hope Scott's right in that it was setting up for fast action, otherwise I've really lost interest.

696
00:33:55,351 --> 00:34:08,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the real problem with the show is not anything wrong with the, with the plot itself or the characters, except that there weren't enough interesting characters introduced early enough.

697
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:16,886
Speaker 1: if there are, cause right now, as far as I'm concerned, the only characters that are even anything are him and the guy that's against him on the rescue team.

698
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,270
Speaker 1: Any other character was just completely had no nothing to them.

699
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,069
Speaker 1: They were just people.

700
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:29,027
Speaker 0: There were a lot of really, really long scenes of him just like sitting there or walking around town with a shopping bag.

701
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:30,117
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

702
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:30,842
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

703
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,262
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

704
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:32,550
Speaker 0: Didn't really catch my interest.

705
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,290
Speaker 1: No, not very interesting watching that happen, but.

706
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,010
Speaker 0: Though I watched the whole first episode.

707
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,149
Speaker 0: For that other show, the generic ninja one, I walked out about halfway through to cook some eggs.

708
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,248
Speaker 1: I turned the generic show off 80% of the way through, cause you know what, there was nothing new gonna happen in it.

709
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, you pretty much get everything you can get out of that show in one episode.

710
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,770
Speaker 0: This show's gonna take at least another episode.

711
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,279
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

712
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:56,250
Speaker 1: I think if the show moved faster, it would be a pretty decent show.

713
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:56,850
Speaker 0: You know?

714
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:57,610
Speaker 0: It might still be a good show.

715
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,710
Speaker 0: I mean, Gasaraki moved real slow.

716
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,949
Speaker 1: It didn't move as slow as this.

717
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:02,849
Speaker 0: Ah, there were times.

718
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,370
Speaker 1: There were times, but in the first episode, at least something weird happened, you know?

719
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:13,989
Speaker 0: Consider that in the first four episodes of Gasaraki, only one thing really happens, and the rest of it is just kinda people talking about it.

720
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in the first episode of Gasaraki, there was something happening to get you.

721
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:25,370
Speaker 1: In this, there's really nothing in the first episode except it's all set up, and they don't actually get to anything, you know?

722
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:34,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, they even hint, 'cause like, the end of the episode is he's going out to actually do his job, and some music starts playing, and you get this sense that something's gonna happen.

723
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,630
Speaker 1: That's the music in the show I like a lot, actually.

724
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, just really laid-back, kinda interesting, hard to describe.

725
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,510
Speaker 0: Just frozen music.

726
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sorta like this generic music.

727
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,909
Speaker 1: It's generic day here.

728
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:47,100
Speaker 1: Yeah.

729
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,470
Speaker 1: But it's also really good.

730
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,870
Speaker 1: It's, you know, awesome, quality background music.

731
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,410
Speaker 1: Just default background music, but awesome.

732
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:57,988
Speaker 1: I like it.

733
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,064
Speaker 1: Like, that was the first thing I noticed in the show, was when they started playing the background music, I was like, "Oh, that's pretty good, I should get the

734
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:03,647
Speaker 1: OST.".

735
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,300
Speaker 0: Yeah.

736
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:07,083
Speaker 1: Other than that, though, uh...

737
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:09,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, so those are the two anime for today.

738
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,708
Speaker 0: Probably no podcast tomorrow unless Scott decides to try to hack something together on his own.

739
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:17,610
Speaker 1: Or I could just get stuff done that I need to get done.

740
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:18,369
Speaker 0: Yeah.

741
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,269
Speaker 0: And once again...

742
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,589
Speaker 1: Because I spend all my time doing this podcast, I don't have time for anything else.

743
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:24,730
Speaker 0: I'll be at Katsucon this weekend, Thursday through Sunday.

744
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,189
Speaker 0: If you want to find me, you won't be able to miss me.

745
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:28,027
Speaker 1: In DC.

746
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I may or may not be doing a cosplay.

747
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:39,790
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

748
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,450
