1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,246
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday March 20th.

2
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:12,169
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:15,097
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:26,964
Speaker 1: We talked about two old PC games that are super awesome Xcom UFO defense and star control - Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:38,511
Speaker 0: So despite the fact that we own all of these games multiple times over never mind the fact that we have emulators We keep buying virtual console games about a virtual console game in a while.

6
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:46,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, we've been playing Super Mario World and I'm happy that I remember as a kid there was that star world.

7
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:55,620
Speaker 0: that was crazy hard and you know when he got to the end of it it totally changed the game and Changed all the graphics and all the turtles started wearing Mario heads and it was kind of weird.

8
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,650
Speaker 0: And I remember as a kid it being this impossible dream.

9
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,339
Speaker 0: to defeat that it took me days and days and days.

10
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:03,150
Speaker 1: Well, at least you could save.

11
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,720
Speaker 1: so it wasn't an impossible dream.

12
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:07,600
Speaker 1: It was just pretty hard, especially for a kid without any help.

13
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:15,336
Speaker 0: Well, I remember as a kid especially funky at the end just banging my head against that level over and over and over again Unable to beat it.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:24,020
Speaker 1: Yeah I like that because Mario games too often You know while it might be a little tricky to figure out where the secrets are or where the alternate exit is.

15
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:32,048
Speaker 1: It's never really hard to beat a Mario level without dying not since Mario 3 Yeah, and parts of Mario World.

16
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:32,509
Speaker 1: Yep.

17
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,045
Speaker 1: So when there's Mario levels in a 2d Mario side-scroller They just can't be beaten.

18
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:38,210
Speaker 1: That's pretty awesome.

19
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,438
Speaker 1: Cuz you know new Mario Brothers didn't have much of that.

20
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,613
Speaker 0: God I'd be new Mario Brothers in like two days.

21
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:43,640
Speaker 1: I beat it so fast.

22
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,140
Speaker 1: I think one of these days I go back and finish getting all the coins.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,208
Speaker 1: I think I've been the big coins cuz.

24
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:53,892
Speaker 1: I think I got all the big coins and like the first three or four worlds Yeah, I got most of them and then I just stopped caring.

25
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:55,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also stopped caring.

26
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:59,239
Speaker 0: It's like I stopped carrying in the Mario to one where you can get the Yoshi eggs.

27
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:05,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was going after those for like a week and then one day I realized that you know I wonder what I get for this.

28
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:10,836
Speaker 0: I looked online and apparently it I think they change one graphic on the start screen.

29
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:18,040
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, yeah, they really have to make some like a if they should make another new Mario Brothers.

30
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:21,780
Speaker 1: But they should make it actually get hard instead of just get interesting.

31
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:22,683
Speaker 0: Well the thing.

32
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:34,420
Speaker 0: my point here the thing that I found way interesting was that now as an adult I played those worlds again And it wasn't trivial to beat them, but I beat them in fairly short order without much difficulty.

33
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also didn't have much problem.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,319
Speaker 1: The only reason I haven't gotten as far as rim because he's gonna be all like hey you suck is cuz I haven't.

35
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,042
Speaker 1: I really Haven't played it.

36
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll say like a week or two.

37
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,153
Speaker 0: We'll see.

38
00:02:44,173 --> 00:02:45,500
Speaker 0: you didn't know where some of the secrets were.

39
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:46,423
Speaker 1: That's cuz.

40
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:47,466
Speaker 1: I never owned the game.

41
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,633
Speaker 1: I only remember we're like the first.

42
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:50,717
Speaker 0: it's no excuse 75% of the secrets.

43
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,405
Speaker 0: I didn't own the game.

44
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,953
Speaker 1: Oh, I should know all the secrets in a game.

45
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:56,716
Speaker 1: I never owned it.

46
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:57,538
Speaker 1: Yes read a fact.

47
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:03,059
Speaker 0: for yes I mean if you don't know where currybo's shoe is even if you've never heard of mario 3 that's not cool.

48
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:13,752
Speaker 0: But I've realized I was thinking back after this when I beat this pretty handily that a lot of these games that as a kid I guess I wasn't good at video games when I was a kid.

49
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,680
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm just a better gamer now.

50
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,660
Speaker 0: But when I played bionic commando, I'm I'm a god at that game compared to what I was as a kid.

51
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:26,363
Speaker 0: I remember it was so hard to get even to the second half of that game And I always died.

52
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:30,679
Speaker 0: I continued all the time and now I can just beat bionic commando without blinking.

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,767
Speaker 1: yet We still can't get anywhere in silver surfer.

54
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,032
Speaker 0: You know, I haven't tried.

55
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,036
Speaker 1: I tried it.

56
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,140
Speaker 1: You can't get anywhere.

57
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,176
Speaker 0: Maybe we should get some emulation going on that Mac and try.

58
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:42,205
Speaker 0: it's all you First one of us.

59
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:44,919
Speaker 0: we should have a bet first one of us to get to the third stage.

60
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:50,800
Speaker 1: If there isn't really a third stage to beat two stages, okay to beat two stages.

61
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,809
Speaker 0: Let's put like 500 bucks on the line.

62
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,773
Speaker 1: No, that's all right.

63
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,985
Speaker 1: I don't have 500 bucks right now And have money troubles.

64
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've realized that I really like Mario world and it's probably my second favorite Mario.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,084
Speaker 0: But I'm also remembering that I think I like Mario 3 a little bit more just because Mario 3 is still harder than I can Deal with easily.

66
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:13,940
Speaker 1: I also well, I'm not sure if Mario 3 actually has more levels.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,666
Speaker 1: It feels like it has more levels.

68
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,553
Speaker 0: The levels are a lot shorter though.

69
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:25,772
Speaker 1: They are but they're also Sort of more interesting and because you can't go back to them I've played a lot of them a lot less.

70
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,098
Speaker 1: So they're more fun to play.

71
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:30,400
Speaker 1: levels I've barely played especially curry boshu type levels.

72
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,069
Speaker 0: Well, there's just more kinds of things and more kinds of levels.

73
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:34,373
Speaker 0: and Mario world.

74
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:36,320
Speaker 0: The worlds aren't that different.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,780
Speaker 0: I mean the mystic forest is a lot different from everything else.

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,413
Speaker 0: But other than that, there's not any really real sense of wonder.

77
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,118
Speaker 0: Nothing really changes between the worlds.

78
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,039
Speaker 0: other than that It gets hard.

79
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,342
Speaker 0: You know what?

80
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,360
Speaker 1: I just realized it feels like in Mario world.

81
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:50,275
Speaker 1: You can a lot of levels you can burn through.

82
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,220
Speaker 1: you just go and write

83
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,261
Speaker 0: Oh if you got a Mario and a blue Yoshi Yeah fly

84
00:04:54,301 --> 00:05:05,099
Speaker 1: over the top and Mario 3 while you can fly over a lot of the levels actually force you to progress through each and every part one You know all slowly and carefully like yep

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,512
Speaker 0: Plus even if you want to fly over it without a p-wing you can't fly forever.

86
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:09,415
Speaker 1: Yep.

87
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:12,165
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right Mario world You can fly forever without a p-wing.

88
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:15,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as you've got I don't know some level of motor control.

89
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:19,478
Speaker 1: Well, there's the level early on in the game where you can just practice to your heart's content.

90
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,213
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, this is turning into like the episode from a couple weeks ago.

91
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,040
Speaker 0: Alright, this isn't really news.

92
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:31,240
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone's aware But I just have to mention the fact that splatter house has been released on the virtual console for the Wii woot.

93
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,187
Speaker 0: The game's not that good.

94
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,175
Speaker 0: I wouldn't recommend anyone actually buy.

95
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,580
Speaker 1: it depends how much it is.

96
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,629
Speaker 1: I would pay three dollars for splatter house.

97
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:39,915
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's not three dollars.

98
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:41,080
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's 800.

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,026
Speaker 0: That seems to be the going travelers.

100
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:45,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, eight hundred points eight dollars.

101
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:47,177
Speaker 0: You mean eight hundred point?

102
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,140
Speaker 1: No, I mean eight dollars.

103
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,550
Speaker 0: There are no dollars and we land.

104
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,154
Speaker 0: there's points.

105
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:57,680
Speaker 0: Yeah You keep telling yourself that a splatter house really it's more a nostalgia thing than anything and I never even really played the game.

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,523
Speaker 0: I just knew about it.

107
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:09,740
Speaker 0: every kid knew about it because in every gaming magazine there were these horribly violent Advertisements for this horribly violent game and the game was marketed on the sole premise that it's horribly violent.

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, splatter house is sort of the over fiend of video games, you know All your.

109
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:17,087
Speaker 1: you're a guy who's basically Jason.

110
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:21,359
Speaker 1: you had a hockey mask that possessed you with evil and gave you powers and a chainsaw.

111
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,025
Speaker 1: Or what a baseball bat.

112
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:34,439
Speaker 1: or two by four usually or what other sort of weapon maybe your fist if you sucked And you walked around a house full of nasty monsters and when you hit them they went splat and they made a big gooey mess everywhere.

113
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:45,940
Speaker 1: Usually that was all gory and nasty and you were just trying to save your girlfriend from this haunted house And then all the bosses were crazy as brain things or whatever and it was just a big mess of gold.

114
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:56,760
Speaker 0: I don't remember if it was splatter house 2 or 1 or which one it was But one of the bosses and one of them I remember was a bunch of bloody fetuses that were just kind of dangle from the ceiling.

115
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:58,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, not so good.

116
00:06:58,676 --> 00:06:59,119
Speaker 1: That's like it.

117
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,896
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you like just walking around hitting things and watching them go splat.

118
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:04,999
Speaker 1: This is the game for you.

119
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,169
Speaker 0: However, you should at least be aware that this game existed because

120
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:08,911
Speaker 1: we have

121
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:22,781
Speaker 0: a lot of problems now with people blaming video games for violence Or whatever and I think a lot of this at least has its earliest Basis origins and the fact that there was an era where a lot of video games were marketed solely on the level of violence in Them.

122
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:25,092
Speaker 0: and this isn't a new debate.

123
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:27,385
Speaker 0: It's just been a mortal combat Mortal combat.

124
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:40,114
Speaker 0: All right That was the one moment in my entire life where as a kid there were people who had a Sega system Who had a 1-up on me because my version of Mortal Kombat didn't have blood.

125
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:43,089
Speaker 1: It was actually a better version though It was.

126
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:47,635
Speaker 0: it was But it didn't have blood and unlike the Sega kids.

127
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,680
Speaker 0: There was no blood code.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,870
Speaker 0: Yep, not that Mortal Kombat was a good game by any stretch.

129
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,635
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat 1.

130
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:56,660
Speaker 0: Mortal Kombat 1 was a mediocre fight.

131
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,685
Speaker 1: It was an okay game.

132
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:00,600
Speaker 1: mortal Kombat 2 was actually a good fighting game.

133
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:06,617
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat 3 is just bad and and any Mortal Kombat greater than 2 is pretty much as bad.

134
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:09,631
Speaker 0: see by the time we had Mortal Kombat 2 which was an okay fighting game.

135
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:11,460
Speaker 0: We could just play Street Fighter 2.

136
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,850
Speaker 1: So I bought a fighter 2 and we had Mortal Kombat 1.

137
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Street Fighter 2 was better than Mortal Kombat 2.

138
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:19,564
Speaker 1: Not really.

139
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:23,616
Speaker 1: I think super Street Fighter 2 was better than Mortal Kombat 2.

140
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:24,960
Speaker 0: Mortal Kombat 2 wasn't that great.

141
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:26,365
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat 2 was alright.

142
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:35,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there's a guy out there named Eli Tomlinson and he's done something that a lot of people have had the idea to do for a long time.

143
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 1: he took some Linux and put it on a CD and he put a game on the CD and You put the CD in your computer and you boot your computer and the game just plays as if your computer was a console.

144
00:08:47,761 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 0: Now many of you might be too young to remember this but there was a time a long time ago Where you would buy computer games and your computer probably was not able to run windows or Your mouse driver and still play the game.

145
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:19,519
Speaker 1: it just if you only had say 8 megabytes of RAM and the game required 6 megabytes of RAM and All your drivers for your hardware required one and a half megabytes of RAM, you know You're running out of RAM pretty quickly there.

146
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:29,067
Speaker 1: So what you've got to do you had to in those days was boot your computer with a boot disk that wouldn't load All the things that are normally loaded.

147
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:33,400
Speaker 1: like you're operating all your you know, you would load less of your operating system.

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:41,040
Speaker 0: Well, what actually happened was a lot of games came with a boot disk So they come with the install disks and the boot disk and they just assume that your computer was too slow.

149
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:44,522
Speaker 0: So whenever you wanted to play the game you put the boot disk in Rebooted.

150
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:55,899
Speaker 0: or if you were uber-leet and you knew about DOS you held f5 when it booted and then you manually loaded your mouse Drivers and your high mem stuff and you shuffled your RAM around and then you started the game.

151
00:09:56,483 --> 00:10:06,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean when you really think about it your computer Oh, I assume it's pretty damn powerful and you look at the system specifications of something like the Xbox 360.

152
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:11,700
Speaker 1: And then you look at the specifications of your computer and you say way my computer is way better than the 360.

153
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,590
Speaker 1: Why do the 360 games look better than the ones on my computer?

154
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,700
Speaker 0: because the 360 isn't run in Linux or Windows and I am And I CQ and Firefox and Photoshop.

155
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:27,119
Speaker 1: It's just you know, if you get your computer to run the game and nothing else It'll be pretty damn awesome.

156
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,870
Speaker 1: Now this guy isn't actually doing that.

157
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:40,740
Speaker 1: He's not putting out awesome games that Are using your computer to its fullest potential and getting those extra 30 FPS that are being eaten up by CPU time on other programs.

158
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:46,340
Speaker 1: He's just taking open-source games putting them on discs and selling them for 20 bucks, huh?

159
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,532
Speaker 1: Which is perfectly legal.

160
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:49,760
Speaker 1: you're allowed to do that.

161
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,512
Speaker 1: If you take the gimp you can put the gimp on a CD and sell that CD.

162
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:54,515
Speaker 1: this is that.

163
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,219
Speaker 1: that's okay thumbs up Open-source people have no problem with that.

164
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,846
Speaker 0: Well most open-source people.

165
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:03,260
Speaker 1: if they do they're crazy because the GPL lets you do that.

166
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,687
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, specifically what if there's all those nutjobs?

167
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:17,812
Speaker 1: you use things other than GPL like the a FPL and it's like that time That's someone in Britain was selling copies of Firefox rebranded I remember that and they called up the Firefox guys.

168
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:23,859
Speaker 1: the the Britain piracy people called up Firefox And they were like people are doing this and they're like, yeah, so they can do that.

169
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,645
Speaker 1: But but we can't.

170
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,914
Speaker 1: that messes up our whole system here catching pirates.

171
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:29,455
Speaker 1: We can't.

172
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:41,818
Speaker 0: but uh, man I remember just one of the greatest days in my life was when I bought four megabytes of RAM to bring my 486 up from four megabytes to eight megabytes and then I could play doom without having to boot f5.

173
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:49,804
Speaker 1: Yep, the interesting thing about what this guy is doing is that he's not selling it as like hey, here's a Linux game That's a boot CD.

174
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:58,474
Speaker 1: He's saying this is a game for the gamix console G a mi X and he's distributing them in blue cases as if they were for a console.

175
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:04,419
Speaker 1: and he says if your computer meets these Specifications then it is a gamix console and it can play these games.

176
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:16,480
Speaker 0: You know, I see the primary market for this sort of thing especially with simple games or open-source games or whatever being Parents who don't know about computers who have younger kids and want to get games for the younger kids.

177
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,290
Speaker 0: But don't understand any of this business.

178
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:21,466
Speaker 0: don't want to install software Don't want to deal with that.

179
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:24,879
Speaker 0: buy a CD boot it kid plays take the CD out.

180
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,866
Speaker 0: now You're back to doing your businessman things.

181
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:35,494
Speaker 1: I could actually almost see like actual PC games going to be a sort of gamix type format, you know, why?

182
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,279
Speaker 1: why can't the next big?

183
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,260
Speaker 1: FPS be a gamix game?

184
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,760
Speaker 1: Well, the only reason that I can see it won't be is because people need to keep their IMS open.

185
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:44,844
Speaker 0: That's what I was about to say.

186
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,650
Speaker 1: need to keep their team speaks open.

187
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,580
Speaker 0: rebooting computers is a gigantic pain in the ass.

188
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:51,285
Speaker 1: It is indeed.

189
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,070
Speaker 0: I mean the Mac downstairs.

190
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,915
Speaker 0: we reboot it pretty much never.

191
00:12:55,256 --> 00:13:01,300
Speaker 0: so when I have to reboot it It's this huge annoyance and the only reason I avoid rooting the primary computer.

192
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:08,142
Speaker 0: I use the you know, geek night's computer because every time I boot it there's a chance it won't come back up It.

193
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,668
Speaker 0: it has some trouble recently.

194
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:10,974
Speaker 0: So lately I'm just leaving it on.

195
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,560
Speaker 1: are you gonna buy a new house soon?

196
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,015
Speaker 1: Are you gonna buy a new one if you change your plan April 22nd?

197
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:23,779
Speaker 0: I'm holding out for that possibility that the memo leaked from Intel was true and that in April They're gonna announce all the new chips and the price cuts.

198
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:28,113
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and if that happens, I'm gonna buy a new computer pretty much that day.

199
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,123
Speaker 1: Oh, you're changing all your plans I see.

200
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:33,110
Speaker 0: actually this has been my plan for like two and a half.

201
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,532
Speaker 0: three.

202
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,017
Speaker 1: plan was like summer.

203
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:35,660
Speaker 1: you're gonna buy.

204
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,256
Speaker 0: Oh, no, my original plan was the week before Team Fortress 2 came out.

205
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:42,560
Speaker 1: See you're changing the plan.

206
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:48,100
Speaker 0: I changed the plan months and months and months ago when I found out they were gonna delay Team Fortress 2 way beyond what?

207
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,024
Speaker 1: Uh-huh All right, whatever.

208
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:51,645
Speaker 1: Yeah.

209
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:52,187
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,875
Speaker 0: I've talked about this on the show a couple times and in the forums.

211
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,320
Speaker 0: It's not new news.

212
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,922
Speaker 0: I changed my plans a long time ago big Flip-flop for.

213
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:05,220
Speaker 0: well originally they said that Team Fortress 2 was gonna come out in spring of this year and that ain't happening.

214
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,306
Speaker 1: So it's not so.

215
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,720
Speaker 1: you're saying it's not okay for them to change their plan.

216
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,579
Speaker 1: So it's not okay for you to change your plans.

217
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:12,987
Speaker 0: No I'm saying because they changed their plan.

218
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:15,998
Speaker 0: I changed my plan and that was a while ago and you knew about this.

219
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:17,384
Speaker 0: and now you're Acting like you didn't know.

220
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:22,584
Speaker 1: so you can make a deal about it on the show when you change when they announced that they were Changing those dates.

221
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,654
Speaker 1: You didn't change your plan to buy a computer in April.

222
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:28,562
Speaker 1: You changed your plan to buy a computer Earlier.

223
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,833
Speaker 0: Well, no, I said ah shits.

224
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:32,240
Speaker 0: What am I gonna do now?

225
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,369
Speaker 0: I don't have to buy it as soon as I thought.

226
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,514
Speaker 0: how long can I hold out?

227
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:37,327
Speaker 0: and the answer is not as long as I hoped.

228
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,121
Speaker 1: no Whatever.

229
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 0: and that was a couple weeks ago when I saw that that was the date supposedly that Intel's gonna release the new chips.

230
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:48,270
Speaker 1: Alright, alright big big plan changing.

231
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,036
Speaker 1: So what see you got any news over there?

232
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got some news And this is kind of interesting.

233
00:14:52,385 --> 00:14:58,489
Speaker 0: It looks like news that rim, but yeah since about that virtual console thing isn't news I'm not gonna make my news every week.

234
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,980
Speaker 0: view whatever the Wii has on the virtual console.

235
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:05,700
Speaker 0: But in actual news the ps3 lost another exclusive.

236
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,650
Speaker 0: It looks like Devil May Cry 4 which I care so little about.

237
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,380
Speaker 1: I care about it less than pretty much almost everything.

238
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,780
Speaker 0: Here's my experience with the Devil May Cry franchise because we didn't have a ps2, but our friend Luke did.

239
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:19,991
Speaker 0: So we went over to his house.

240
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:20,920
Speaker 0: He said check out this game.

241
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,952
Speaker 1: This is a Devil May Cry was brand new like the new hotness.

242
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, like two days after it came out We're sitting in his apartment.

243
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,880
Speaker 0: Yep, and he's playing and he's having a great time and the graphics look great.

244
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:41,667
Speaker 0: So he hands me the controller and for like a half hour I'd hit a thing with a sword and then I jump and shoot while I fell through the air in slow motion And I just did that over and over again.

245
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:55,824
Speaker 0: It was so awesome to jump in the air and shoot in slow motion and Another hour went by and we all took turns shooting things in slow motion in the air And then eventually the next day we realized that there really wasn't anything else to that game And we stopped playing.

246
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:01,252
Speaker 1: all we did was walk around this castle and whenever there was a monster You would kill it in some way.

247
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:06,459
Speaker 1: that looked really cool But was the same thing every time and then eventually the game was over.

248
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:13,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we read on the internet about all the people talking about the various difficulties or annoying things later in this game.

249
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:17,400
Speaker 0: And then I stopped caring about Devil May Cry and I didn't even know that there was a three.

250
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,038
Speaker 0: So the fact that there's a four here means I'm kind of out of the loop.

251
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:29,000
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's not a ps3 exclusive anymore and there's rumors going around that Metal Gear might be going the same route.

252
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:38,230
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if you're a game developer if you're gonna really decide to make your game ps3 exclusive You're pretty much asking to lose money.

253
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,580
Speaker 1: I mean you just you can't do it business wise.

254
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:44,691
Speaker 1: You're paying how much money to develop Metal Gear Solid for millions of dollars.

255
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:50,840
Speaker 1: if you choose to sell it on only the ps3 Pretty much almost nobody is gonna buy it.

256
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,920
Speaker 1: I mean sure You'll some people will buy ps3 is just to get your game because your game is that good or that popular.

257
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:07,579
Speaker 1: It's such a big franchise and people with ps3s will almost all definitely buy the game sort of like everyone with the GameCube will buy Wind Waker and everyone with a Wii will buy a Twilight Princess, right?

258
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,955
Speaker 1: But it's still not enough to make back the millions you spent to die metal get.

259
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,582
Speaker 1: make Metal Gear Solid 4.

260
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:19,440
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I can only see two situations where a game developer would ever make a game exclusive.

261
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,955
Speaker 0: Number one is if whatever you're doing with your game requires something that is only on a particular console.

262
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,768
Speaker 0: if you want Xbox Live You gotta be on the Xbox.

263
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,740
Speaker 0: Yes, you want the remote you got to be on the Wii.

264
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,038
Speaker 0: If you don't want to sell your game, you got to be on the ps3.

265
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,239
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is the ps3 doesn't have a lot to offer so far.

266
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,371
Speaker 0: I mean even it, you know, it's supposed to be so much more powerful.

267
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:50,520
Speaker 0: yet a lot of games are having some trouble Capitalizing on that power and I haven't really seen any games that look like they really push the ps3 to its limit.

268
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:54,140
Speaker 1: Even if they do push the ps3 to the limit, they got to be good girls.

269
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,300
Speaker 1: I mean I could go and make a game that pushes the graphics of the ps3 the limit.

270
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:01,335
Speaker 0: Oh, it's all just be a double dodecahedron raytracer.

271
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,099
Speaker 1: That's what it is.

272
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:08,840
Speaker 1: It draws a really cool double dodecahedron and you can look at it from different angles by controlling it with your six axis

273
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:13,204
Speaker 0: And then it draws a thousand of them and they bounce against each other in a real-time Physics engine

274
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,460
Speaker 1: and then it fills the thing with water and you can see the fishes go out.

275
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:28,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the only other reason would be if the people who control a console decided to pay a developer X amount of money To make the game exclusive.

276
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:40,480
Speaker 0: now I don't think that Sony has enough money to pay the people who make these games To release their games only on the ps3 at least now when there aren't so many ps3s in the world in people's hands.

277
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:46,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like you got to assume All right What if they made Metal Gear Solid 4 at for the Xbox?

278
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,480
Speaker 1: 360?

279
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,210
Speaker 1: right and it would cost them X much to make the game.

280
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:53,144
Speaker 1: and then the end they would make X profit if they Sell it on the ps3.

281
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:54,488
Speaker 1: they would only.

282
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,856
Speaker 1: they would only get X dollars.

283
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,980
Speaker 1: They might not even profit.

284
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:04,522
Speaker 1: So they're basically Sony would have to pay them the difference for it to be worth it for them to make it a Sony Exclusive.

285
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,088
Speaker 0: Yep and game developers.

286
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:09,440
Speaker 0: It's not like they have loyalty to a console for any reason other than money.

287
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,889
Speaker 0: I mean square there was.

288
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,760
Speaker 0: they used to be buddy buddy with Nintendo.

289
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:19,120
Speaker 0: Everyone always forgets that Final Fantasy started in Nintendo and stayed on Nintendo for a long time.

290
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:23,040
Speaker 0: A lot of people would say through the best of Final Fantasy, but I'm not gonna get into that.

291
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:29,900
Speaker 1: In fact if Nintendo didn't you know have troubles with square soft the PlayStation would never would have been anything.

292
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:35,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean square had an actual not personal falling out with Nintendo.

293
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:43,786
Speaker 1: Yeah In addition to the non personal issues and whether you realize it or not if that falling out did not occur then Final Fantasy 7 Would have not come out for the PlayStation.

294
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:50,777
Speaker 1: it would have coming out for the n64 or something else and then no one would have Bought a PlayStation or at least Sony would be nothing.

295
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:51,963
Speaker 0: right now You know what.

296
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:55,400
Speaker 0: there's a chance that if that had happened the Dreamcast might have done better.

297
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:58,180
Speaker 0: That is true, and that would have been a great god.

298
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,854
Speaker 0: We got to go back in time and kill also the Saturn.

299
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:02,120
Speaker 1: the Saturn would have done better.

300
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:03,912
Speaker 0: We got to go back in time and fix this.

301
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:04,960
Speaker 0: yeah, okay?

302
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:06,425
Speaker 0: There's a disturbance.

303
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:09,540
Speaker 0: if we correct this then the Saturn becomes a viable console.

304
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:13,376
Speaker 1: No, the only the real solution is to make sure mist is never released.

305
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,686
Speaker 1: ah Released many years later.

306
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,335
Speaker 0: We got to do a show on mist so I can complain about it.

307
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:26,780
Speaker 0: Okay, and Riven I never played the other ones me either, but I know about them because I knew people who played them all right.

308
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:30,240
Speaker 0: But yeah, this isn't big news in and of itself.

309
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,110
Speaker 0: But if Metal Gear and other franchises start dropping from the ps3 exclusive visit II

310
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,553
Speaker 1: exclusivity

311
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:42,593
Speaker 0: yeah Then that's not really a good thing for Sony because pretty

312
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:42,955
Speaker 1: much

313
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:50,116
Speaker 0: the only reason to buy one Console over the other if you ignore things like how much they cost is The game library on it.

314
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:56,919
Speaker 0: and if a game is released equivalently on all three consoles or on two different consoles You don't need both consoles.

315
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,027
Speaker 0: if you like that game you only need a console.

316
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,254
Speaker 0: if you want a game That's only gonna be on that console.

317
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:10,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean no one goes out and buys an Xbox 360 for Madden or something like that because Madden's on every console.

318
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:15,302
Speaker 1: so as long as you got one You don't need it doesn't matter which one you've got.

319
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,548
Speaker 1: you've got Madden.

320
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:17,913
Speaker 1: It's there It's gonna be there.

321
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:22,030
Speaker 1: yep, but you buy a Wii to get Twilight Princess cuz you can't get it anywhere else.

322
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:31,101
Speaker 0: But if you have a Wii and Madden comes out on the Wii and say an identical Madden came out on the Xbox There's no reason to buy an Xbox to get that Madden.

323
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:36,601
Speaker 0: well the only reason is Sometimes people I said identical if it's not identical yeah some.

324
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,945
Speaker 1: well even if it is identical.

325
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:45,024
Speaker 1: sometimes people are super fans And they'll want to get you know the games for different consoles also, but if they're identical Well it's also.

326
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:52,029
Speaker 1: sometimes You know let's say you have a Wii a PS 3 and a 360 and a game comes out for all three And it's the same game on all systems.

327
00:21:52,632 --> 00:22:05,050
Speaker 1: You still might you know you if even if you only buy one you might choose to get say the ps3 one because you like That controller or you might choose to get the Xbox one because you use your Xbox more than use your other consoles.

328
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:06,757
Speaker 1: So it's easier for you.

329
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:15,430
Speaker 0: well like the case of Soulcalibur 2 if you had a GameCube You're pretty much an idiot if you bought that game for something other than the GameCube because it was Really, it's best on the GameCube.

330
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:17,710
Speaker 1: Well you might have been a fan of those other care.

331
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,329
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you might have been a fan of the characters, but in terms of the game itself It was better on the GameCube.

332
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:27,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least it was better on the GameCube and the Xbox than it was on the PlayStation.

333
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:29,706
Speaker 1: no No the PlayStation 2 one was actually the second best.

334
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:34,209
Speaker 1: Soulcalibur 2 I don't know anyone who bought the Xbox one Soulcalibur 2. who bought that?

335
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:37,610
Speaker 0: I've read forums where people were talking about the one with spawn.

336
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:38,754
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

337
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,537
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

338
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,983
Speaker 0: they prefer the Xbox one.

339
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:44,778
Speaker 0: they've complained that the ps2 one was slow And they're not really slow, but that didn't look good.

340
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,763
Speaker 1: I don't cares what it looks like it's it's a fighting game You fight.

341
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:53,530
Speaker 0: no I care a little bit about prettiness in a fighting game because otherwise why not just have stick figures?

342
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:55,297
Speaker 1: Why not just have stick figures?

343
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:58,470
Speaker 1: you can make a badass stick figure fighting game if you had really good stick figures.

344
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:05,928
Speaker 0: things of the day.

345
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,690
Speaker 0: So doom 2 is probably one of my favorite FPS is ever in terms of single-player.

346
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:15,944
Speaker 0: I really really like it that in half-life 1 or together is the best games.

347
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:24,130
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not the best FPS ever now considering we have half-life 1 & 2 and system shock 2 which I still haven't played and some others.

348
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,483
Speaker 1: But it's a classic, and it's still awesome.

349
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,130
Speaker 0: I think it holds its own even today.

350
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,005
Speaker 0: I mean serious Sam is the only game that's even tried.

351
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:32,830
Speaker 1: I think it's fine.

352
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,820
Speaker 1: I think the problem is it had yeah It's a different style than the FPS is of today And I like that style less than I like these.

353
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:45,502
Speaker 1: you know current half-life style of single-player FPS But in its style it might be the best one.

354
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,029
Speaker 0: well the thing is the current.

355
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:48,536
Speaker 0: well You call it the current style.

356
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:51,110
Speaker 0: not many FPS has really pulled that off well at all.

357
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:51,957
Speaker 1: I know that's.

358
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:57,730
Speaker 1: the thing is that when it's pulled off It's the best, but it's only pulled off like maybe five or six times in history.

359
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:09,448
Speaker 0: Well anyway I used to make a lot of doom 2 mods when I was a kid and I made some fun ones and some clever ones And some stupid ones, but this one here is probably the most hilarious one.

360
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:10,009
Speaker 0: I've ever seen.

361
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,833
Speaker 0: no I didn't make it.

362
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,580
Speaker 0: according to YouTube it was made in Peru.

363
00:24:13,143 --> 00:24:14,910
Speaker 0: it is Super Mario Doom Brothers.

364
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:17,078
Speaker 0: You might think this is gonna be stupid.

365
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,563
Speaker 0: I'd recommend you watch it.

366
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:20,510
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty hilarious.

367
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:28,698
Speaker 1: I remember back in the day the first doom mod ever was Barney doom because in those times Barney You know the big purple dinosaur was.

368
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,509
Speaker 1: everyone loved to make fun of it and say how stupid it was and Everyone hated it in the stupid songs that it sang in the whole thing.

369
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:44,630
Speaker 1: So they made Barney doom where you could kill Barney with the doom weapons And there would be Barney bad guys And you'd kill them while it's saying it's terrible song, and it was great.

370
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:54,790
Speaker 0: We had a project in middle school where we had there's like this cross Curriculum BS where he had to get into teams and do all these parts of a project and involve designing a candy factory.

371
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,675
Speaker 0: You might wonder why this is relevant.

372
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:11,273
Speaker 0: me being all clever decided that what I would do for part of this was make a virtual Reality mock-up of our factory and all I did was open up wadded and windy and all those things make a little Semi crappy.

373
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:17,532
Speaker 0: doom level with the right textures to look vaguely like a candy factory was basically just a doom level without any monsters In it.

374
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:20,350
Speaker 0: I got rid of the gun and replaced it with like a spatula.

375
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:25,606
Speaker 0: I put a chef hat on the doom guy and I got an A because that was the most amazing thing.

376
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,493
Speaker 0: my teachers couldn't believe That.

377
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:30,369
Speaker 0: I made this virtual reality world for a project in school.

378
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:36,626
Speaker 0: I Even left to some of the monsters in and one of the rooms.

379
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:39,300
Speaker 0: like workers I just took away their shoot animations.

380
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,910
Speaker 0: all they did was wander around and stare at you And they were still zombies.

381
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:53,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's another video from doom - and it's this punk kid Definitely a punk kid.

382
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:54,440
Speaker 1: There's no doubt.

383
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:56,650
Speaker 1: and he's like hey everyone check this out.

384
00:25:57,111 --> 00:26:08,478
Speaker 1: This is a secret level in doom - the secret level that is Straight out of Wolfenstein 3d the secret level that anyone who's ever played doom - knows about.

385
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:13,000
Speaker 0: well kid I got this to say to you and that is welcome to the internet.

386
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:14,284
Speaker 1: I mean this kid.

387
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:23,214
Speaker 1: this video would the only equivalents that I can think of would be if someone Like made a video and said hey, here's how you get the whistle in mario 3.

388
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,260
Speaker 1: Hey, here's how you do the Konami code.

389
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,568
Speaker 1: Do you know that it works in Contra and Gradius?

390
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:28,552
Speaker 1: No, holy shit.

391
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:30,157
Speaker 0: I think it's even a step beyond that.

392
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:35,220
Speaker 0: cuz this kid I don't know where to begin first off before we even go any further.

393
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:39,032
Speaker 1: Hey guys, I found this great movie Star Wars.

394
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:40,035
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen it?

395
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:41,460
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

396
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:44,778
Speaker 0: Well one the kid has to cheat to beat the cyberdemon.

397
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:45,220
Speaker 1: Okay?

398
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, he says.

399
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:54,046
Speaker 1: when he opens the door and the cyberdemon comes out He says in the video luckily I got some cheats I Can beat the cyberdemon with the pistol.

400
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:58,180
Speaker 1: anyone with any amount of skill can beat the cyberdemon with the pistol without getting hit.

401
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:01,053
Speaker 0: I punched a cyberdemon to death just to see if I could.

402
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:07,260
Speaker 1: as long as it's only one Cyberdemon if there's two at the same time and you can't get them to kill each other then it could be a little tough.

403
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:09,575
Speaker 0: Actually a map that I always had a lot of fun.

404
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:10,360
Speaker 0: I was a custom one.

405
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,626
Speaker 0: I don't know who made it, but I had it.

406
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,760
Speaker 0: It was basically this arena like a gladiatorial arena.

407
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:17,671
Speaker 0: It was you and three cyberdemons, and that's it.

408
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:19,920
Speaker 1: the trick is to get them to kill each other.

409
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,430
Speaker 1: They won't till there's just one left.

410
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:21,914
Speaker 0: They won't.

411
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:22,618
Speaker 0: I fought them all.

412
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,899
Speaker 1: It sucks as long as I can do it one at a time.

413
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:29,189
Speaker 0: Not really, uh, hey, that's how I trained.

414
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,780
Speaker 1: yes, I did I can do that, but I couldn't do it with the pistol.

415
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:38,220
Speaker 0: I defy anyone who has ever listened to geek nights to beat me in a doom tube deathmatch.

416
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:44,065
Speaker 1: Anyway, it gets even worse because after he beats the cyber team with his cheats He goes into the next room.

417
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:47,260
Speaker 1: if you play doom - you know, what's in the next room of the secret level?

418
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's and commander keen there's four commander Kean's.

419
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,340
Speaker 1: hang in there and you shoot them and then you flick the switch and the game's over.

420
00:27:55,263 --> 00:28:00,740
Speaker 1: He says all right, can someone please tell me why this is the kid the kid says in the video.

421
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:07,897
Speaker 1: Can someone tell me why there's a football player dead hanging on ropes at the end of doom - it's?

422
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,805
Speaker 1: Commander keen what the?

423
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:18,049
Speaker 1: can someone tell me why there's a plumber going down pipes in Mario 1 I don't know - is commander keen to his credit.

424
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:21,560
Speaker 0: He was probably not born when commander keen was popular.

425
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:32,635
Speaker 0: I'll bet half of our listeners have never played a commander keen game and they're just as bad as this kid for not knowing Just as bad Scott commander keen was old hat when we were in middle school.

426
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:34,600
Speaker 1: That's the point, but I know about it.

427
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,673
Speaker 1: It's like oh gee, what's this game?

428
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:37,739
Speaker 1: It's dig duck.

429
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:40,740
Speaker 0: You gotta know commander keen.

430
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:45,340
Speaker 0: I don't think the vast majority of people in the world today have any idea who commander keen is ready.

431
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:52,986
Speaker 0: Okay ID these are the same people who don't realize that Duke Nukem was a fun 2d platformer long before it was an FPS Id software.

432
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:58,347
Speaker 1: the people who made doom and Wolfenstein and everything and quake Before they made those games.

433
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:02,240
Speaker 1: They made a game called commander keen and there were actually quite a few commander keen games.

434
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:08,380
Speaker 1: It was a platform game kind of like Mario you jump around and you know, you do stuff you pick up items.

435
00:29:08,804 --> 00:29:10,560
Speaker 1: You would kill bad guys with this laser gun.

436
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,388
Speaker 1: Basically you're on an alien world.

437
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:17,626
Speaker 1: you collected treasures you found secret exits But it wasn't platform.

438
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,360
Speaker 1: like Mario gets at the end of the level even though there was some of that.

439
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:21,868
Speaker 1: It was sort of platform.

440
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,080
Speaker 1: figure out your way around the level.

441
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,840
Speaker 1: It's kind of a little bit of a maze a little bit exploring a little bit.

442
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:28,297
Speaker 1: You know.

443
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:33,280
Speaker 1: Do you want to take the risk and go for that extra goody if you want to miss the spikes that sort of thing?

444
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,236
Speaker 0: Kinds of games that aren't around so much anymore.

445
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:43,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, and The thing about commander keen that was awesome was that you had this pogo stick and it was all about the pogo stick.

446
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,951
Speaker 1: and The plot was you were like.

447
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:48,926
Speaker 1: you were a kid And you were like in your pair.

448
00:29:48,946 --> 00:30:03,857
Speaker 1: you're in your bedroom and then suddenly you were needed on a planet far away to save like the universe from aliens or something and you would get in your little UFO with your football helmet and your ray gun Or your pogo stick and you go to another planet and save the day.

449
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:10,364
Speaker 0: now The best part about this kid's little internet video where he shows us His voice.

450
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:18,360
Speaker 0: this kid has such the nerdly punk kid voice that it was almost painful to hear it And he doesn't know crap about video games.

451
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:28,940
Speaker 0: I do however salute this kid because he has shown me that no matter how connected the world is There are always going to be nubs and the nubs don't know that they're nubs.

452
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:32,999
Speaker 1: You know, there was a baby born just now and it doesn't know anything.

453
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,512
Speaker 1: It doesn't even know who Mickey Mouse is who Mario is.

454
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:36,900
Speaker 1: it doesn't know nothing Scott.

455
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:49,450
Speaker 0: there are probably a lot of kids who are gonna play Twilight Princess and they don't even know that there was this other Zelda game for this archaic Gray box that came out when their parents were younger.

456
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:52,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, they will cuz the virtual console will show them the way.

457
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,375
Speaker 0: no Maybe maybe their parents aren't gonna give him the credit card.

458
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,080
Speaker 0: Let him buy games.

459
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,891
Speaker 1: Oh, no, but they'll see in there in the virtual console.

460
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,100
Speaker 1: They'll see these games that they're still there.

461
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,851
Speaker 0: Maybe that's the true power of the virtual console that it will show.

462
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:08,728
Speaker 0: it'll force kids to at least know that they used to be something else.

463
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:24,530
Speaker 1: I Think eventually one day, you know how we have sort of have classic books, you know and they're like there's a special section in the bookstore for the classics, you know, like Moby Dick and Shakespeare and all all those the classics.

464
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,240
Speaker 1: and there's movies that are the classics.

465
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,680
Speaker 1: It's a whole TV channel that just shows them all day long.

466
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:35,000
Speaker 1: We're gonna have the all-time classics of video games one day and they'll be in every store.

467
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:42,020
Speaker 0: You know on that special section the classics interestingly to me and not to belie any sort of fanboy and ishness or anything.

468
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:49,483
Speaker 0: But if I think about games that I would consider classic the vast majority of them are Nintendo games Pretty much.

469
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:58,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that might just be due to the fact that Nintendo had a virtual monopoly on the gaming market for a long Time longer than anyone else and possibly at the present time.

470
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't.

471
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:04,717
Speaker 0: I honestly didn't think Nintendo would come back so strong until the we came out and did.

472
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:08,151
Speaker 1: gangbusters Not the DS stills is better.

473
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:09,980
Speaker 1: Alright, so what are we talking about today?

474
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:17,180
Speaker 0: Well, I really wanted to do a show on xcom mission UFO also known as xcom enemy unknown or xcom UFO defense.

475
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:20,211
Speaker 0: But Scott sucked at the game and never played it.

476
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,876
Speaker 1: I barely played this game.

477
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:32,740
Speaker 1: I never had it Barely even knew much about xcom until way later and You know while I recognize that it is a great classic awesome game, and I know about it.

478
00:32:33,182 --> 00:32:38,980
Speaker 0: I didn't play it enough to really do a whole episode But at the same time Scott had a game that he wanted to talk about.

479
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:46,745
Speaker 1: Yes, perhaps one of the best games ever if not the best game ever maybe the best PC game ever You couldn't argue.

480
00:32:46,765 --> 00:33:02,144
Speaker 1: it is no worse than the second greatest PC game ever Star control 2 which rim has never played and I think a lot of people I've turned it on and poked at it I've just never played it for more than a Trivial amount.

481
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:07,520
Speaker 1: and a lot of people who didn't have you know, DOS computers don't even know about this game.

482
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,445
Speaker 1: They ever played it yet.

483
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:11,420
Speaker 1: It is no worse than the second best PC game ever.

484
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,318
Speaker 0: See now I would say the exact same thing about xcom mission UFO.

485
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:19,799
Speaker 0: I consider it to be one of the greatest bar none PC games ever made.

486
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,126
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like them and tie fighter.

487
00:33:22,608 --> 00:33:25,336
Speaker 0: Well tie fighters the number one and save - there's no question.

488
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:26,480
Speaker 0: tie fighter got the same city.

489
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:26,841
Speaker 1: Do that.

490
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:46,837
Speaker 0: I remember back in the day when tie fighter got the highest score PC gamer which used to be a fairly legitimate reviewer of games had ever given a 97% and then years later a game beat tie fighter with 98% and the only game that was ever good enough to beat tie fighter was tie fighter re-released on CD.

491
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:50,439
Speaker 1: So Yeah, it's a good thing.

492
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:51,016
Speaker 1: It's a good.

493
00:33:51,561 --> 00:34:01,351
Speaker 1: I think we'll do well combining these two games into one show where we sort of have a similar experience with each great old PC games For DOS that you played one and I played one.

494
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:03,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one seems to know about them anymore.

495
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:03,760
Speaker 0: care now.

496
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,460
Speaker 0: There's also a lot of things that you should take away from this episode.

497
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:14,438
Speaker 0: One that I think is interesting is that both of these are kinds of games that not only aren't made anymore But have almost never been made.

498
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:17,159
Speaker 0: There are so few games that are like this.

499
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,763
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's.

500
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:23,353
Speaker 1: there's not many games like star control except star control and xcom.

501
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:26,484
Speaker 0: there were sequels that were ass and there Have been a lot of people.

502
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:35,620
Speaker 0: xcom was so good back in the day that even to this day There are a lot of people trying to make xcom clones or trying to recreate xcom and they all suck.

503
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:49,715
Speaker 1: Yes, good God I mean it would be trivial like I could imagine easily a game in the same genre as xcom Had a better interface than xcom and was a better game than xcom UFO defense.

504
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,797
Speaker 1: not any the other xcoms.

505
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,594
Speaker 1: yet No one has made them despite trying even though it's just you can.

506
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:56,678
Speaker 1: I can think of it right now.

507
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:57,826
Speaker 1: It's in my brain There it is.

508
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:00,504
Speaker 0: It's definitely feasible Yeah but it ends up being.

509
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:06,439
Speaker 0: these are both fairly unique games and what I really want you to come out of this is that you Can get a hold of these games?

510
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,807
Speaker 0: They're not lost to the star.

511
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,436
Speaker 1: control is much easier to get a hold of.

512
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:12,609
Speaker 1: the next combat Is not impossible is trivial to get a hold of.

513
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:15,560
Speaker 0: I'm going to link to the underdogs download of xcom.

514
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,346
Speaker 0: Oh snap, you can just play it.

515
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:18,068
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

516
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:21,580
Speaker 0: I have I own two legitimate copies of xcom.

517
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:22,964
Speaker 0: I also have a third.

518
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:26,554
Speaker 0: the first xcom is the first game I ever got.

519
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:31,039
Speaker 0: that wasn't just a shareware game Or some sort of crap puzzle game for a computer.

520
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:37,058
Speaker 0: Mmm, also I pirated it cuz I didn't know that there was such a thing as software you could buy.

521
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:46,596
Speaker 0: Haha But anyway You can get these games and I cannot recommend enough that you play both of these games.

522
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:56,534
Speaker 0: if you consider yourself a gamer by any stretch at least try to play these games and look at them and Examine them and I guarantee that you will like at least one of them a lot.

523
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,280
Speaker 1: It's pretty much impossible.

524
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,416
Speaker 1: It's like if you're a movie person you can't just like not watch citizen Kane.

525
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,828
Speaker 0: awesome Blanca You have to watch him biodome.

526
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:09,779
Speaker 1: So if you have to watch those and you got to play these.

527
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:20,960
Speaker 0: So in 1993 microfroze released this game called UFO enemy unknown in Europe And it was then released in America titled xcom UFO defense.

528
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:24,600
Speaker 0: There was also xcom mission UFO, which was the same game.

529
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:29,960
Speaker 0: I don't know why but I saw boxes of it that said xcom mission UFO, but it was the exact same game.

530
00:36:30,302 --> 00:36:33,259
Speaker 1: It's sort of like when they put out a comic book with two covers and then you buy both.

531
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,300
Speaker 1: They're trying to scam you and to find the same game twice.

532
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:36,922
Speaker 0: I don't know.

533
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:41,320
Speaker 0: I think there might have been issues with it being released in different places and things getting knocked around.

534
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,880
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter because the game is xcom people called by all these names, but xcom is basically the name.

535
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:52,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are other xcom games that came later like Xcom apocalypse xcom terror from the deep.

536
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:53,571
Speaker 0: They're all garbage.

537
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:58,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only one you care about is the original xcom UFO something something.

538
00:36:58,506 --> 00:36:59,490
Speaker 0: Yeah UFO defense.

539
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,113
Speaker 0: We'll go with that.

540
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:03,366
Speaker 0: That's the easiest way to nominate Hereby known as xcom.

541
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:03,687
Speaker 0: Yes.

542
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:08,225
Speaker 0: Now this game were for the PC right out of 486.

543
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:10,380
Speaker 0: It was fairly high for the time.

544
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,514
Speaker 0: my computer had to be booted specially to run it because my computer was really slow.

545
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:31,726
Speaker 0: it barely met the requirements and To say what genre the game is in would be very difficult to do because it has it's kind of remember how act razor for The SNES had basically two entirely different games within itself and they interacted with each other Xcoms kind of the same way.

546
00:37:32,107 --> 00:37:35,380
Speaker 0: the plot of xcom nominally is that aliens?

547
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,908
Speaker 0: Exists there.

548
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:37,554
Speaker 0: We see them.

549
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:38,180
Speaker 0: They're out there.

550
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,380
Speaker 0: They are gray men and they have UFOs and they have started causing trouble on earth.

551
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:49,800
Speaker 0: They start abducting people and mutilating cattle and then they start attacking people straight up.

552
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,468
Speaker 1: They start just invading earth flat out.

553
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:56,580
Speaker 1: We are going to take over earth and kill you all and we're not just gray aliens.

554
00:37:57,582 --> 00:38:01,460
Speaker 0: Well, we don't actually know their motivations other than that they are attacking earth for some reason.

555
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:11,940
Speaker 0: Yeah And attacking earth means literally coming into a city suddenly and trying to kill everyone there in Horrible ways and harvest their organs and ways they get more horrible as the game goes on.

556
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:14,830
Speaker 0: So the governments of the world all try to fight this on.

557
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:43,894
Speaker 0: there's actually an extensive backstory to xcom where the Japanese Created this group that tried to fight him and failed and other people got together and eventually the United Nations Creates what is effectively nerve from Evangelion xcom the secret organization funded by the world governments that Basically exists in these underground bunker bases much like nerve and your goal is to identify the threat Defend the earth from it and eventually eliminate the threat entirely.

558
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:45,600
Speaker 0: You don't know what the threat is.

559
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,228
Speaker 0: You really have no idea what's going on other than that.

560
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:49,592
Speaker 0: These alien attacks are occurring.

561
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:51,980
Speaker 0: you start with almost nothing.

562
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:53,820
Speaker 0: UN gives you a pile of money.

563
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,570
Speaker 0: You've got conventional weapons that the earthlings have.

564
00:38:56,811 --> 00:39:02,359
Speaker 0: the aliens meanwhile have horrible alien Technology and plasma rifles and psychic powers.

565
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:13,027
Speaker 1: yeah, you basically start the game with a few guys that have machine guns maybe a rocket launcher a grenade or a pistol and Like one shit one fighter jet.

566
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:13,809
Speaker 1: basically.

567
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:21,853
Speaker 0: now the general gist of the game is that you've got to Somehow fight off this alien threat and it caused money to do this.

568
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,100
Speaker 0: you get money from the UN and all the UN member states.

569
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:30,356
Speaker 0: Every year the UN evaluates your performance and decides whether or not to increase your budget.

570
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:35,091
Speaker 0: if you do really poorly Nations might back out of the treaty altogether and stop funding you.

571
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:37,800
Speaker 0: Let's say all your bases around North America.

572
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:43,654
Speaker 0: Maybe Russia eventually is sick of this and pulls out and tries to fight the aliens on their own Meaning you lose funding.

573
00:39:44,055 --> 00:39:57,680
Speaker 0: if you do really horribly the UN will drop the project altogether and abandon it in which case you get Probably one of the best endings to a video game ever where the game basically says yes over the years the aliens Completely enslave humanity and destroy everything.

574
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,383
Speaker 0: Good job.

575
00:39:58,784 --> 00:39:59,045
Speaker 1: Yes.

576
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:02,649
Speaker 1: Good job You're the MVP of the alien team.

577
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:08,290
Speaker 0: So the way the game actually starts in terms of gameplay is you pick a spot on the globe.

578
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,319
Speaker 0: It can be anywhere on the globe.

579
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:12,810
Speaker 1: You've got a 3d globe even in the water.

580
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:15,202
Speaker 0: Well, not in the water anywhere in the land Antarctica.

581
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:15,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can put.

582
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:17,252
Speaker 0: you can put a base there All right.

583
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:18,578
Speaker 0: I have put bases there.

584
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:21,270
Speaker 0: Okay, and you stick it somewhere now.

585
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:25,265
Speaker 0: Obviously you probably want to stick it near countries that have more money.

586
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:28,889
Speaker 0: So you keep them happy So they keep giving you more money.

587
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:34,230
Speaker 0: But aside from that you put a base down and now the game suddenly starts in real time.

588
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,833
Speaker 0: Time is ticking away in five second intervals 24/7.

589
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,304
Speaker 0: Well, can't you change the speed?

590
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:41,230
Speaker 0: I'll get to that.

591
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:47,490
Speaker 0: So you can watch the shadow of the of the Sun and the earth going around and you just watch the earth in real time.

592
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,136
Speaker 0: You can spin it around zoom in zoom out.

593
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:50,922
Speaker 1: Now remember, even though rim is saying it's 3d.

594
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:55,836
Speaker 1: This is old DOS Pixelated graphics doing this.

595
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:59,290
Speaker 1: This is not a 3d card with your DirectX's go.

596
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,590
Speaker 0: No, it's polygons.

597
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,150
Speaker 0: But the graphics are actually very good for the time and they're passable even for modern games.

598
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:11,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're good enough to make the game work, but they are not like, you know, don't don't Think incorrectly about them.

599
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,821
Speaker 0: Well, they're actually they're very good.

600
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,550
Speaker 0: And I think they're better than almost every open-source game out today.

601
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:19,160
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, pretty much just because they're really clean.

602
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,730
Speaker 1: It's like they did the best they could with the technology they had.

603
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:25,510
Speaker 0: Yes, so time progresses in real time constantly.

604
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,235
Speaker 0: You can alter the rate.

605
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:28,137
Speaker 0: the time passes.

606
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:32,248
Speaker 0: ranging from every interval is 5 seconds to every interval is 24 hours.

607
00:41:33,777 --> 00:41:34,525
Speaker 1: That's dangerous.

608
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:42,015
Speaker 0: Yes well the nice thing is you've got your base and you're sitting there and you're waiting and whatever you can click on your base and There's a billion options.

609
00:41:42,055 --> 00:41:43,902
Speaker 0: You've got an actual base with a grid.

610
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:51,242
Speaker 0: you can build hangers in it or alien containment things or Armories or all the stuff you would need to man a base.

611
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:52,970
Speaker 0: you got to manage your scientists.

612
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,874
Speaker 0: You're doing research.

613
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:55,863
Speaker 0: your engineers will build stuff for you.

614
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:57,370
Speaker 0: You've got a higher troops.

615
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:03,090
Speaker 0: Every single person you hire gets a name and a individual stats.

616
00:42:03,492 --> 00:42:14,210
Speaker 1: You have to pay them a salary and you out you equip them with individual weapons Like you're like, okay This guy has a clip of ammo in his right pocket and he carries a pistol and there's a rocket launcher in his backpack.

617
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,890
Speaker 0: Yes, luckily a lot of those things are automated.

618
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,302
Speaker 0: You really don't have to worry about them other than tweaking a few things here and there.

619
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:20,985
Speaker 0: but they're there.

620
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:21,928
Speaker 0: Yes, they're there.

621
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:27,070
Speaker 0: the game Basically, you're managing the entire UFO defense.

622
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:31,110
Speaker 0: You are the CEO of the secret company that is fighting the aliens.

623
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:33,599
Speaker 0: You have to manage the salaries of everyone.

624
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,610
Speaker 0: you have to manage the politics of when to shoot down aliens Where you have to decide on the science every single thing?

625
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:40,520
Speaker 0: You've got to manage.

626
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:46,990
Speaker 0: as a result There's a fairly fantastic interface where you look at this globe and you've got your base and you've got radar installations.

627
00:42:47,070 --> 00:43:00,096
Speaker 0: Whatever whenever an alien UFO is picked up or whatever anything's going on It'll stop time and pop up a warning saying hey UFO designation 001 has been spotted and depending on what technology you have Maybe you'll learn more about it.

628
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,070
Speaker 0: and then the game just continues at five-second intervals.

629
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:06,849
Speaker 0: It always drops to five seconds whenever there's trouble and you have to decide how to respond.

630
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:12,430
Speaker 0: So you'll have interceptor craft and the sky Ranger which is kind of your bus full of troops.

631
00:43:12,578 --> 00:43:24,290
Speaker 1: Yeah Typically your first response is send out a ship that to shoot down the alien UFO because if you can do that You're gonna be a lot better off than if you just let it go about its business and it's gonna start killing people.

632
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:26,702
Speaker 0: Yes, the UFO is actually.

633
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:27,830
Speaker 0: it's fairly complex.

634
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:35,361
Speaker 0: Once you learn to decode the aliens encryption and read their communication you start to find out exactly what each of these ships are doing.

635
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:42,622
Speaker 0: and it gets really interesting like say you see a Terror ship and you know, it's on its way to a city to do some sort of terrorist mission.

636
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:52,050
Speaker 0: or very interestingly later in the game You might start seeing supply ships and they're big and fat and they're full of goodies and say you wonder why are there supply ships?

637
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,793
Speaker 0: Where are they going?

638
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:56,350
Speaker 0: So then, you know say you see hey, these supply ships are always going to run Antarctica.

639
00:43:56,833 --> 00:44:04,290
Speaker 0: so you fly over to Antarctica with one of your interceptors and tell it to Patrol around and you find an alien fucking base in the middle of the Antarctic.

640
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,206
Speaker 0: Oh shit and all sorts of things like that.

641
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:15,109
Speaker 0: or They build alien bases in Russia and then they infiltrate the Russian government And then they force the Russian government to pull out of the treaty and stop funding you.

642
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:20,386
Speaker 1: Yep, now remember rim said it was kind of like Actraiser where there's two parts the city building part.

643
00:44:20,547 --> 00:44:20,948
Speaker 1: and then yes

644
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:45,977
Speaker 0: you know, well in this case the two parts are one the strategic manageable the tactical and strategic management of this entire enterprise from the bottom up from the hiring and firing of Individual people working for your program to the budget to the technology to making sure all your equipment is in but melt maintained Well fueled you have bases with radar coverage everywhere Reacting to multiple UFO threats simultaneously.

645
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:50,730
Speaker 0: Yeah prioritization all that fun stuff that alone would be a fantastic fucking game.

646
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:55,774
Speaker 0: I mean when you send ships out to fight you don't actually have to sit and fight There's no sort of.

647
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:57,742
Speaker 0: now you pull out the joystick and fight.

648
00:44:58,265 --> 00:44:59,430
Speaker 0: You're more like the commander.

649
00:44:59,771 --> 00:45:00,976
Speaker 0: You told the ships to go out.

650
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:01,799
Speaker 0: you told him where to go.

651
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:04,570
Speaker 0: you watch on your display as they fight the UFOs.

652
00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:11,510
Speaker 0: you can give them orders like stand down or Maintain a safe distance or destroy the UFO at all cost.

653
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:15,003
Speaker 0: But otherwise, they act pretty much on their own and you're the commander.

654
00:45:15,063 --> 00:45:20,320
Speaker 0: You're not the person doing the dirty work Until until the other hand land on the ground.

655
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:22,547
Speaker 0: Well, let's say you shoot down a UFO.

656
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,469
Speaker 0: what you're gonna do at some point I hope unless you're really bad at this game.

657
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,956
Speaker 0: Now you take all your troops.

658
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:31,307
Speaker 0: you equip them with your technology you equip them with rifles and whatever.

659
00:45:31,347 --> 00:45:32,150
Speaker 0: you load out your thing.

660
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:37,170
Speaker 0: Maybe you buy a tank to go with you and you send your sky ranger out and you land at the UFO site.

661
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:43,850
Speaker 1: Sky ranger is a ship that's full of soldiers and it lands on the ground Whereas the interceptor is a ship that flies around shooting alien ships.

662
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:48,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, now you can get other ships in the game, especially later when you start getting alien technology.

663
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:51,803
Speaker 0: See, you don't know what the threat is.

664
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:53,290
Speaker 0: That's the best part about this game.

665
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:54,915
Speaker 0: You don't know anything.

666
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:57,624
Speaker 0: when the first UFO comes up, you know, nothing.

667
00:45:57,644 --> 00:45:59,590
Speaker 0: you have no idea what this what's going on.

668
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,456
Speaker 0: So you shoot it down then you land.

669
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:02,439
Speaker 0: you don't know what to expect.

670
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:18,362
Speaker 0: it now turns into this kind of top-down Isometric kind of view of a gridded battlefield a three-dimensional battlefield and you control individual troops in a direct turn-based tactical strategic game.

671
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,387
Speaker 1: you control them.

672
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:35,209
Speaker 1: so micro II like you say you duck now and you Turn and face in that direction and look around and you walk three spaces that way Crouch and aim at the door and if anyone opens that door you shoot them.

673
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:37,350
Speaker 0: Now the system is based on time units.

674
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:46,281
Speaker 0: so a troop will have say 70 time units and they can use time units to do actions and Say every step you take uses X time units.

675
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:49,879
Speaker 0: drawing a weapon uses X time units But you can just have weapons drawn.

676
00:46:49,899 --> 00:47:04,834
Speaker 0: you can set people up ahead of time Loading and unloading weapons ducking standing back up take different amounts of time units shooting takes time units And the thing is you can use all your time units to move around and then when you've moved all your units you end the turn And then the aliens go.

677
00:47:05,295 --> 00:47:10,790
Speaker 0: that alone would have been an okay game, but it's semi real-time even though it's turn-based.

678
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:17,670
Speaker 0: So let's say I am walking one of my troops out and there is an alien who sees where I troop.

679
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:20,930
Speaker 0: So I'm walking and my troop walks into the aliens line of sight.

680
00:47:21,411 --> 00:47:28,903
Speaker 0: The alien if he has enough time units and his reaction speed is high enough compared to that troop might get to open fire During my turn.

681
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:40,430
Speaker 1: yet The thing is while you're you know normally in a game With sort of with the turn-based grid military combat if a guy has X movement points You usually use a lot of those movement points.

682
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,237
Speaker 1: You don't care about saving any of them.

683
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:48,197
Speaker 1: in this game if a guy has 10 movement 10 time units You're only gonna want to use maybe five.

684
00:47:48,518 --> 00:47:55,741
Speaker 1: that way, you know, wherever he stops if an alien jumps out at him He'll have a chance to shoot at the alien maybe or run away or some.

685
00:47:55,861 --> 00:48:00,636
Speaker 0: it'll take say 23 time units to fire a weapon on Automatic fully automatic weapon.

686
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:01,038
Speaker 0: Yep.

687
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:08,062
Speaker 0: So well a lot of strategy involves like say you've got to go into a building You'll get all your troops lined up outside in their proper positions.

688
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:09,026
Speaker 0: wait around.

689
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:19,207
Speaker 0: then the next round You'll have like three people storm in duck and sit there in defensive positions Covering the rest of your troops who storm into the next door and get ready to toss a grenade through.

690
00:48:19,227 --> 00:48:24,265
Speaker 0: Yep You really have to play it to see the full extent of this and I don't.

691
00:48:24,306 --> 00:48:32,273
Speaker 0: I can't go into great detail since Scott has to talk about his game, but suffice to say this style of combat is Incredibly fun.

692
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:34,500
Speaker 0: It is also incredibly difficult.

693
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,661
Speaker 1: Yeah, I basically just die whenever I try it even though I Understand the general principles and strategies.

694
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:42,930
Speaker 1: I just can't seem to do it without just getting killed.

695
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,750
Speaker 0: See, I actually have no trouble at all and I I can blow through xcom even on very difficult settings with relative ease.

696
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,661
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

697
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,810
Speaker 1: I just can't ever kill any aliens.

698
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:58,310
Speaker 1: Really, maybe I'll play the first mission and maybe I'll beat it, but I'll lose some of my guys.

699
00:48:58,671 --> 00:48:59,394
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

700
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,061
Speaker 0: The game is one.

701
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:03,170
Speaker 0: the difficulty scaling of this game is very good.

702
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:12,266
Speaker 0: the difficulty options you have when you start a game range in good granularity from Trivially easy to absolutely fucking impossible.

703
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:24,665
Speaker 0: Haha But even in general the game itself even on an average difficulty in the early game You'll you don't realize it but you're gonna take 50% casualties If not more your troops are gonna get slaughtered.

704
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:25,570
Speaker 0: you have no armor.

705
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,838
Speaker 0: You've got conventional weapons.

706
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:28,750
Speaker 0: the aliens have their crazy alien technology.

707
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:33,990
Speaker 0: I think Scott your problem was that you weren't willing to accept high casualties early in the game.

708
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:44,015
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it was is if I lost stuff then I would go back to that base You know the other part of the game and I wouldn't have anything and aliens would come and I'd be like, oh shit I have no money.

709
00:49:44,055 --> 00:49:44,539
Speaker 1: I have nothing.

710
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,090
Speaker 1: it just all got blown up by aliens.

711
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:46,950
Speaker 0: That's part of the game.

712
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:49,069
Speaker 0: the best way to enjoy this game is to not do the.

713
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:53,370
Speaker 0: Save your game every single turn and make sure you always play the game perfectly optimally.

714
00:49:53,696 --> 00:50:04,150
Speaker 0: It's more fun If say one of your missions gets wrecked and now you've got the three Surviving troops one of whom is carrying the fourth surviving troop who is wounded and can't walk anymore.

715
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:13,722
Speaker 0: Two of them are covering your retreat as you desperately try to drag the little bit of alien technology in the one alien corpse You recovered back to the sky Rangers.

716
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:15,430
Speaker 1: I never recovered alien corpses.

717
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,050
Speaker 0: Well, the nice thing is the game automates a lot of stuff.

718
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:26,627
Speaker 0: Like if you defeat all the aliens in a crash site, it says all right You've completed them all and it automatically assumes that you take everything from the site.

719
00:50:26,908 --> 00:50:29,410
Speaker 0: Yep There's a lot more to the game than this.

720
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:32,090
Speaker 0: Obviously, I've gone over it in the briefest and briefest of detail.

721
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:49,325
Speaker 0: But the only other thing I want to talk about aside from the fact that there's the one game Which is awesome and then the other kind of mini fighting game inside of it That's equally awesome Both of which would be great standalone games in and of themselves is that there is this ufopedia Which is a lot like the encyclopedia in civilization -

722
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:50,350
Speaker 1: the civil opedia.

723
00:50:50,557 --> 00:51:04,585
Speaker 0: Yes The way it works is you don't know anything about the UFO threat but you have scientists and you can allocate their time to studying alien resources or Alien corpses or alien technology or maybe you capture a live alien and you try to interrogate him.

724
00:51:05,006 --> 00:51:10,367
Speaker 0: as you learn about this threat you start filling out this encyclopedia and learning about what's going on.

725
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:28,969
Speaker 0: and Part of the game is that the first time playing through the game is probably the best experience you'll ever get Because you're learning about the game and you're trying to figure out what's going on so you can deal with this alien threat and you'll learn interesting things about the aliens and Eventually start to figure out what the actual plot of the game is and start taking action from there.

726
00:51:29,774 --> 00:51:32,370
Speaker 0: The plot is also incredibly well put together very solid.

727
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,550
Speaker 0: The game is just so solid and so tight and the only problems it has are problems.

728
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:45,890
Speaker 1: They're just inherent with the fact that this game was made in 1993 And no one's even tried to make you in recent years to make this kind of game anymore.

729
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:48,490
Speaker 0: Yes, I won't talk about the sequels because they're terrible.

730
00:51:49,952 --> 00:51:52,280
Speaker 0: I'm gonna review this game more fully someday.

731
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,544
Speaker 0: Maybe when Scott's not around.

732
00:51:53,564 --> 00:52:00,620
Speaker 0: but suffice to say xcom is without question one of my favorite games ever definitely top two.

733
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:13,254
Speaker 1: All right, so in 1990 a game developer known as Toys for Bob made a game called Star Control famous battles of the Urquan conflict volume 4.

734
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:16,050
Speaker 1: This is Star Control 1.

735
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:38,733
Speaker 1: Basically all Star Control 1 was was a game where you controlled in real time in a 2d top-down view Spaceships big giant spaceships, even though they weren't so giant on the screen They really were giant in outer space shooting at other spaceships in Spaceship melee, even though it's not actual melee because they all projectile weapons But it's melee.

736
00:52:39,234 --> 00:52:51,139
Speaker 1: and the way it works is each ship has a main weapon which when you fire it reduces your energy meter but then your energy refills at a rate dependent on which ship you have selected and You have a crew and the crew in your ship.

737
00:52:51,199 --> 00:53:00,057
Speaker 1: when you get hit that some of them die and when they all die your Ship explodes and the other guy has the ship and you shoot at each other and you have also have a secondary attack Which is different for every ship.

738
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:02,390
Speaker 1: that might you know do something weird.

739
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:03,917
Speaker 1: And what eventually?

740
00:53:03,937 --> 00:53:13,929
Speaker 1: the other guy blows up or you blow up and then if you're you know You have a fleet of ships you pick another ship from your fleet and you fight again and there's different ships for all the different Races, even though you don't know what the races are.

741
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,211
Speaker 1: You don't know anything about the Urquan conflict volume 4.

742
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:21,985
Speaker 1: You don't know why these battles are famous battles of the Urquan conflict unless you you know.

743
00:53:22,025 --> 00:53:24,754
Speaker 1: read some text in the instruction manual Which is not really a help.

744
00:53:25,196 --> 00:53:28,090
Speaker 1: It's just a real-time 2d space combat game.

745
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:33,429
Speaker 1: That's kind of interesting with lots of different ships that have funny abilities, but there's not much to it.

746
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:37,949
Speaker 1: So what happened is people said hey, what about this?

747
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:53,785
Speaker 1: Urquan conflict thing you guys are talking about and star control 1 was popular enough that they were able to make star control 2 the Urquan masters in 1992 Star control 2 in a lot of ways like XCOM is two different games.

748
00:53:54,428 --> 00:54:04,851
Speaker 1: one game is The game I just described star control 1. even though it the the combat and star control 2 It's pretty much the same thing as the combat and star control 1.

749
00:54:04,851 --> 00:54:08,096
Speaker 1: It's better in a lot of ways that the graphics aren't shit cuz.

750
00:54:08,116 --> 00:54:15,518
Speaker 1: star control 1 was like a crap game for old ass computers like DOS Amiga Commodore.

751
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:18,273
Speaker 1: I think there was a Genesis version but it sucked.

752
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:28,469
Speaker 1: star control 2 was for the DOS and also the 3do and It was had a lot better graphics, and it was actually playable, and it was way cool.

753
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:33,681
Speaker 1: and Basically you had the same combat action of you know shooting each other.

754
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:39,870
Speaker 1: you could actually choose to just play a combat game Like it was star control 1. use the ships from star control 2 and just fight each other.

755
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,467
Speaker 0: I remember there was a lot of that action at RIT and colony when people were bored.

756
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:50,970
Speaker 1: yep But the combat and star control 2 is not as great as say the tactical walking around guys in XCOM.

757
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:51,893
Speaker 1: It's just there.

758
00:54:52,555 --> 00:55:06,850
Speaker 1: and the real game is the space adventure if you've ever read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy or any sort of similar Sci-fi stories where there's lots of different alien races that have funny personalities.

759
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,457
Speaker 1: That's what star control 2 is all about.

760
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:15,801
Speaker 1: here's the story of star control 2. you are an earth Human scientist of some sort.

761
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:20,900
Speaker 1: you were out researching Lost ancient space traveling technologies.

762
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:29,810
Speaker 1: you come back to earth only to find that has been surrounded By a shield and you cannot get to earth in any way possible, and it's really strange.

763
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:32,179
Speaker 1: And this is where the game begins.

764
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,150
Speaker 1: you are in your precursor battleship.

765
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:40,370
Speaker 1: This is a big giant awesome spaceship that you just researched and recovered.

766
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:46,690
Speaker 1: Imagine like if the best fighter jet in the world was actually like deep underground.

767
00:55:46,852 --> 00:55:48,269
Speaker 1: We dug it up and rebuilt it.

768
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:54,908
Speaker 1: Yeah The Romans made it and they buried it and you just found it and now you fly it back to earth And you can't get to earth and the game begins.

769
00:55:55,612 --> 00:55:56,655
Speaker 1: You've got this spaceship.

770
00:55:56,935 --> 00:56:03,436
Speaker 1: You've got a galaxy, and you don't know what stars are which it's just a galaxy full of stars And you don't know what the hell's going on.

771
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:04,780
Speaker 1: you're in your ship.

772
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,390
Speaker 1: your ship has fuel and some other resources.

773
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:13,468
Speaker 1: You can spend those resources to do things like upgrade your ship outfit it with new weapons etc.

774
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:13,569
Speaker 1: etc.

775
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:15,495
Speaker 1: That's not so important.

776
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:16,879
Speaker 1: you've got this ship.

777
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,903
Speaker 1: you're in space.

778
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:20,150
Speaker 1: you came back to earth after your scientific mission.

779
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,715
Speaker 1: You can't go to earth what the fuck.

780
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:26,270
Speaker 1: so you go to the moon, and there's a guy there on the moon.

781
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,880
Speaker 1: you will just you basically go to that.

782
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,262
Speaker 1: you fly your ship to the moon and You land there, and you can send this little.

783
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:41,278
Speaker 1: every time you go to a planet You can drop this little guy onto the planet and drive it around the surface of the planet usually to collect resources but also to find things.

784
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,091
Speaker 1: and on this planet you find a Spathy.

785
00:56:44,753 --> 00:56:51,430
Speaker 1: a spathy is one of the alien races that is so humorous in this game that you will lull ten times a spathy.

786
00:56:51,911 --> 00:57:02,881
Speaker 1: Yes, spathy the spathy are this really really funny alien race that has like one big eyeball and They all have these great personalities and voices.

787
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:05,270
Speaker 1: and basically the spathy are cowards.

788
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:24,783
Speaker 1: They run away and the spaceships that they have have these BUTT missiles the backward utilized tracking torpedoes, uh-huh yes, that you fly the spathy ship you fire your secondary weapon and it goes and A missile comes out the back of the ship and then homes in on the enemy.

789
00:57:24,823 --> 00:57:26,670
Speaker 0: that sounds utterly hilarious.

790
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:28,381
Speaker 1: It is hilarious.

791
00:57:28,784 --> 00:57:29,449
Speaker 0: I'm sure

792
00:57:30,317 --> 00:57:30,882
Speaker 1: Trust me,

793
00:57:31,226 --> 00:57:31,529
Speaker 0: okay

794
00:57:33,314 --> 00:57:54,170
Speaker 1: And he tells you this whole story and you come to realize by traveling around the galaxy and meeting alien races That there are these earthquake guys who have basically gone around To the different races in the galaxy and said you have two choices You can either be enslaved by the earthquake or we will surround your planet with a slave shield

795
00:57:54,392 --> 00:57:56,309
Speaker 0: Surround planet to stay alive.

796
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:08,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Supposedly the earthquake are doing this to save all the alien the different races of the galaxy from some unknown threat of evil When really they're just being evil.

797
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:38,885
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna reveal the whole plot of how you eventually save the galaxy or not But this game is really awesome because at one hand you're going around the galaxy Meeting alien races being diplomatic with them trying to figure out where to go to get the next thing to maybe get this one more alien race to join your side or give you some ships to help you fight or To you know fight against the earthquake to free all the other good races in the galaxy.

798
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:45,770
Speaker 1: at the same time You're trying not to die in the horrible loneliness and quietness of space.

799
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:52,430
Speaker 1: You're constantly trying to scavenge for resources to keep your ship fueled or else you can't make it to the next star system.

800
00:58:52,994 --> 00:59:01,809
Speaker 1: You're constantly trying to you know Get one more bit of plutonium so you can build another ship so that you can go and destroy those evil aliens over there.

801
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:06,390
Speaker 1: You're trying to figure out where the hell do these aliens live?

802
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:10,170
Speaker 1: There's all these stars and it's completely unmapped galaxy.

803
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:15,064
Speaker 1: you're just exploring this big giant unknown place and you'll go to some.

804
00:59:15,144 --> 00:59:19,999
Speaker 1: you go to a new star system and All the planets will just be gas giants with nothing on them.

805
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:28,003
Speaker 1: and you go to another star system and all the planets are gas Giants with nothing on them and it the whole atmosphere of the game.

806
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:44,926
Speaker 1: It's like comedic and Incredibly entertaining different personalities of aliens that when you actually meet them but also the cold reality of space and the Epic plot of a giant war and when you actually have combat you whip it out and do it.

807
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:46,070
Speaker 1: star control one style.

808
00:59:46,675 --> 00:59:57,647
Speaker 0: It seems like both of these games Have one thing in common in that while they definitely have some replay value probably xcom more than your game Yeah, the thing with star control 2 is that once you know?

809
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:02,516
Speaker 1: Basically what order to do things in like, okay This is how you beat the game.

810
01:00:02,556 --> 01:00:03,401
Speaker 1: you go to this planet.

811
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:04,266
Speaker 1: talk to those people.

812
01:00:04,326 --> 01:00:04,930
Speaker 1: go to that planet.

813
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:05,874
Speaker 1: Talk to those people.

814
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:09,026
Speaker 1: go collect resources on these planets because you know where the resource.

815
01:00:09,066 --> 01:00:10,029
Speaker 1: good resources are.

816
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:11,495
Speaker 1: Build this and this and this.

817
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:14,106
Speaker 1: go there once you know it and you've memorized it.

818
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:20,937
Speaker 1: the whole Exploration of space aspect which is what makes the game so great It's kind of gone because you're not exploring.

819
01:00:20,957 --> 01:00:29,143
Speaker 1: you already know where everything is star control - you really have to go into it cold Not read any facts not do any tricks.

820
01:00:29,203 --> 01:00:37,862
Speaker 1: just go into it and pretend That you are this human scientist who came back from a mission Totally found earth surrounded by a slave shield.

821
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:39,008
Speaker 1: You have no clue what's going on.

822
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:49,490
Speaker 0: Yep I mean while xcom is a lot more replay value just due to the nature of the game It still seems like both of these games have a lot to be gained by playing them from a completely ignorant standpoint.

823
01:00:49,916 --> 01:01:00,309
Speaker 0: Don't go to game facts Don't read anything other than the instruction book and just play these games Like an ignorant person and learn from the game as you go, and I think they're much more rewarding that way.

824
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:15,430
Speaker 1: absolutely Another thing after star control 2 which is pretty much the only star control worth playing It's the most popular and the most everything there was a star control 3 Developed developed by a different company, but still published by accolade.

825
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:19,443
Speaker 1: I kind of like star control 3 a lot more than most of the star control.

826
01:01:19,483 --> 01:01:29,110
Speaker 1: people like it because it still has sort of That explore the galaxy, you know talk to alien stuff and it still has the same combat only a little upped in the graphics.

827
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:32,261
Speaker 1: But it's really not quite the same.

828
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:38,762
Speaker 1: instead of collecting resources you sort of Have these Master of Orion style colony building things.

829
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:40,930
Speaker 1: It's not it's not really so great.

830
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,097
Speaker 1: But star control 3 it.

831
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:56,628
Speaker 1: they've also replaced the pixelated Animations of the different aliens with actual like live puppets of the aliens Which are actually high quality better than Muppets almost and they have really good voice acting in star control 3 also.

832
01:01:57,211 --> 01:01:58,709
Speaker 1: So it's worth playing for those two things.

833
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:05,589
Speaker 1: but basically star control 4 never came out and Star control all the games became unplayable on modern systems.

834
01:02:06,212 --> 01:02:11,850
Speaker 1: So the original people who made star control to those in star control one those toys for Bob guys.

835
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:17,511
Speaker 1: They took the 3do code the code for the 3do version of star control 2.

836
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:26,583
Speaker 1: They open sourced it under the GPL and now you can download for free legally a game called Simply the earthquake masters.

837
01:02:26,724 --> 01:02:27,749
Speaker 1: It is absolutely free.

838
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:33,006
Speaker 1: It runs on Windows Linux Mac OS X and BSD and that is what you are going to play.

839
01:02:33,046 --> 01:02:38,399
Speaker 0: if you're listening to this podcast Yep, and I know a lot of you use Windows So I'm just gonna link to the download for xcom.

840
01:02:38,439 --> 01:02:41,190
Speaker 0: you can just play it cuz you're not gonna find this game for sale anywhere.

841
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:48,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll link to the website for our quan masters, which you can download a hundred percent legally instead of gray area legally.

842
01:02:48,272 --> 01:03:01,223
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm going to find out Somewhat shortly whether or not xcom works in wine Because I suddenly have this burning desire to play that game again, and I'm going to app get installed UQM to play some earthquake.

843
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:07,805
Speaker 0: masters god This might be a problem if we ever keep reviewing old things We like because it kind of forces us to play those games again.

844
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:11,023
Speaker 1: as we're reminded about him I'm gonna put it on my laptop and play it on the tree.

845
01:03:11,064 --> 01:03:11,305
Speaker 1: the whole

846
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:23,010
Speaker 0: time you were talking I was mostly ignoring you and thinking about all the stuff that made xcom great and thinking about how much I wanted to get some heavy plasma and some flying armor and Just fly around lighting up the goddamn city

847
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:27,990
Speaker 1: You know we should do is you should install our quad masters and I should get xcom to work in wine.

848
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:32,506
Speaker 0: I think I should play through both xcom and our quan masters.

849
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:33,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, you suck.

850
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:41,070
Speaker 1: Yes great old PC games you probably never played if you are not super old-school.

851
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:47,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is definitely where a lot of our complaints about modern PC games come from where there are good PC games now.

852
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:53,350
Speaker 0: But very few games these days live up to the games that I played as a kid and it shouldn't be that way.

853
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:56,807
Speaker 0: Why aren't people making games as good as games back then?

854
01:03:56,827 --> 01:04:04,650
Speaker 1: well I think it's because the PC has always been a platform where there was a high potential for Innovation and game development because anyone could make a PC game.

855
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,321
Speaker 1: I mean look star control is made by toys for Bob.

856
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:08,084
Speaker 1: who the hell are they?

857
01:04:08,365 --> 01:04:09,289
Speaker 1: they're just two guys.

858
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:21,465
Speaker 1: And in the early days when it was easy to make PC games and there wasn't a big business around it People making PC games are all trying cool stuff like the people who made hero quest.

859
01:04:21,906 --> 01:04:28,130
Speaker 1: and if you've made xcom And all that, you know all that people made the guy a person made mule all that stuff.

860
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,675
Speaker 0: I think you meant quest for glory.

861
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:31,683
Speaker 1: All right quest for glory right?

862
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:33,108
Speaker 0: I was like hero quest hero quest.

863
01:04:33,409 --> 01:04:34,513
Speaker 0: All right That's the board game.

864
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:38,670
Speaker 1: No, no, not hero quest quest for glory or police quest all that stuff all that stuff.

865
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:47,260
Speaker 1: You had all these people making really interesting games of the PC because you can make any PC game you want it Unlike a Nintendo or an Atari game where you couldn't make any game you wanted.

866
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:55,265
Speaker 1: and then eventually the PC games Just started to fall into these genres, you know, like Warcraft 1 was crazy.

867
01:04:55,286 --> 01:04:57,614
Speaker 1: It was like holy crap an RTS It's insane.

868
01:04:58,016 --> 01:05:01,932
Speaker 1: and then you know, holy crap Wolfenstein an FPS that's insane.

869
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:07,069
Speaker 1: and then a few genres eventually stuck out from the rest and carried on.

870
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:17,129
Speaker 1: and All the other really interesting unique PC games were like one hits like yep There's start control - no one could ever make game like that again.

871
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:22,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, or even some genres that used to exist don't exist anymore, where are my free space?

872
01:05:22,508 --> 01:05:22,850
Speaker 0: flight sims?

873
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:24,874
Speaker 1: I know tell me about it.

874
01:05:24,915 --> 01:05:31,056
Speaker 1: There was a. it was TIE fighter and wing commander x-wing Alliance Yep, and there was free space.

875
01:05:31,156 --> 01:05:35,970
Speaker 1: I think free space - was the last free space fly-around shooting game.

876
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,338
Speaker 0: He's the last good one partly because there's no more joysticks.

877
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,382
Speaker 1: I don't know.

878
01:05:39,683 --> 01:05:46,208
Speaker 0: It's sort of joystick I bought in 1994 was superior to any joystick I've seen in a Best Buy since.

879
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:57,530
Speaker 1: yeah I think it's sort of a catch-22 where there are no joysticks because there are no flight sims that require joysticks But at the same time there are no flight sims because there are no joysticks.

880
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:04,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anyone sees a flight stick pro from back in the day, let me know cuz I got one But I finally broke it.

881
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:15,230
Speaker 1: I was actually always a fan of the separate it like throttle and joystick combos But there was only one good one of those ever and the modern version of it sucks cuz it's all flimsy.

882
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:24,366
Speaker 0: God, not only did I convince my dad to shell out 70 bucks for a flight stick Pro But I then opened it up and modded it with much thicker springs.

883
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:25,650
Speaker 1: It's very important.

884
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,089
Speaker 1: I have a joystick that is difficult to move around.

885
01:06:34,772 --> 01:06:37,358
