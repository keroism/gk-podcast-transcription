1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,937
Speaker 0: So it's been a little while since we've done a roomly reviews, huh?

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,193
Speaker 1: And also Scott doesn't watch shows as far as I can tell.

3
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:17,534
Speaker 1: Yeah.

4
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:18,840
Speaker 0: Oh, well, he watches anime.

5
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,066
Speaker 0: Apparently though do anime stuff.

6
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:24,094
Speaker 0: and also you don't read as many comics cuz there's been comics.

7
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,077
Speaker 0: I've been like room.

8
00:00:25,137 --> 00:00:29,617
Speaker 1: You gotta read this Watching anime reading books playing overwatch.

9
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:34,235
Speaker 0: Yeah Overwatch Like overwatch, I think overwatch.

10
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:34,840
Speaker 0: It was funny.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,735
Speaker 0: I was I went and saw the Guardians of the Galaxy or not?

12
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:43,507
Speaker 0: Guardians of the Galaxy Thor Ragnarok Very similar vibe.

13
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:56,273
Speaker 0: It was one of the crazy space nonsense ones and They played like as a trailer before the movie a commercial for overwatch And I don't know all the cinematics and everything.

14
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:57,620
Speaker 0: I just like the feel of it.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:08,264
Speaker 0: I mean blizzard doesn't half-ass things I always really get like hype even though I don't really play the game and like the times I played it I'm really really bad at it, but it's like Play.

16
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:09,207
Speaker 0: I mean like I own it.

17
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,611
Speaker 0: so it's like why not?

18
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:19,259
Speaker 0: but even if I just do like the AI mode I could always just like go and zip around his tracer fun against bots.

19
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:26,662
Speaker 1: But anyway, but in particular Scott won't watch anything that has live-action Actors.

20
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:27,988
Speaker 1: he'd a TV for.

21
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,011
Speaker 0: no, that's a lie because he will watch Korean shows You he doesn't so much even like the dramas.

22
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:39,600
Speaker 0: he likes the variety stuff, but he will watch Asian television.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,071
Speaker 0: But he won't watch domestic television, but he won't watch television.

24
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,560
Speaker 1: That is like serial plots anymore.

25
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:46,884
Speaker 0: So much.

26
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,133
Speaker 0: I mean he was never super big on that as far as I can tell.

27
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,136
Speaker 0: he never really like.

28
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:54,800
Speaker 0: he always hated Star Trek Yeah, and he wasn't a fan of Firefly.

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,664
Speaker 0: He was like cuz.

30
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:59,040
Speaker 0: we were all like yeah Firefly like ten years ago, and he was like boo.

31
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:07,597
Speaker 0: He also only ever saw like one episode Yeah but he never has struck me as somebody who would get really into a TV show which is kind of weird.

32
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:26,600
Speaker 0: because I think with the way the markets moving like movies and television are really converging like the budgets are getting higher on TV and Because most people consume them in a binge watching format because of Netflix and Hulu and all the streaming services Their plots are getting more contiguous.

33
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:32,832
Speaker 0: They're not as episodic anymore And even though they'll often have plot arcs per episode.

34
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:38,002
Speaker 0: They have like a general season-wide Narrative.

35
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:45,000
Speaker 0: so I think I think it's kind of like you're you're missing out a bit if you don't watch any television.

36
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,045
Speaker 0: and What are the things.

37
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:50,454
Speaker 0: you want to hear something weird that I noticed.

38
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:51,860
Speaker 0: so I was walking down.

39
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,366
Speaker 0: I mean you will say I don't see.

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,560
Speaker 0: In the subway at Grand Central and one thing I noticed almost every ad was for a TV show.

41
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,887
Speaker 0: Almost none of them were on a network.

42
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,680
Speaker 0: They were all Hulu Amazon Prime Netflix.

43
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:17,960
Speaker 1: It also makes sense because the main things that get advertised Well the main thing that gets advertised in America is cars, and you can't really sell cars to people who are in Manhattan in the city.

44
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:20,951
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like you know those those things.

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,598
Speaker 0: They'll have Broadway shows.

46
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:30,800
Speaker 0: They'll have Generally their entertainment billboards like in that corridor going from the seven train to the Metro North and stuff like that.

47
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:35,495
Speaker 0: You you have this blank look on your face like I don't see it.

48
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:35,857
Speaker 0: No.

49
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:36,560
Speaker 1: I just don't notice.

50
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,386
Speaker 1: I'm like I just ignore them and avoid them.

51
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,272
Speaker 1: I just don't care.

52
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:45,309
Speaker 1: like I'll see I'll see a poster and say oh That's there's some TV show, but I literally don't even look at the name of it.

53
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:46,212
Speaker 0: anyway now.

54
00:03:46,393 --> 00:04:01,687
Speaker 1: You can really tell the streaming Revolution has has changed the landscape of television well to the point that I think as people like Netflix start making these shows They're gonna push movies off of these streaming platform Which kind of sucks.

55
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,278
Speaker 1: cuz I think it's pretty much.

56
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:07,156
Speaker 1: no I'd say 90% of the time if I type the name of a movie into Netflix.

57
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:07,719
Speaker 1: It's not there.

58
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,580
Speaker 0: well That's that's the way their business model is moving.

59
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:17,769
Speaker 0: They they actually said they're gonna dump a ton of money into original content Which for me with Netflix is kind of hit or miss.

60
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,014
Speaker 0: some of the things are amazing and some of the things seem like really dumb.

61
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,459
Speaker 0: But yeah like hardly any of the like more obscure foreign films or the big blockbuster films Don't end up on Netflix anymore.

62
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,088
Speaker 0: They're definitely moving more toward.

63
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,563
Speaker 0: we'll have to pay like three bucks to rent a movie on Amazon except They're not.

64
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,209
Speaker 1: they're moving even further into like.

65
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:46,552
Speaker 1: everyone seems to want to have their own service of check out our movies Like the Disney one, which I'm probably gonna pay for.

66
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:48,519
Speaker 1: I feel like we should just pirate them.

67
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:54,060
Speaker 0: It just well, I mean, that's what the core mean spikes a good reason to do a lot of things.

68
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,387
Speaker 0: The cord cutters were just like.

69
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:03,571
Speaker 0: well, you know all this if you pay for all the streaming services It's more expensive and I feel like it's starting to move that way.

70
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:09,220
Speaker 0: Like everybody has original content and like Oh, well, if you want Game of Thrones, you got to do HBO.

71
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:14,919
Speaker 1: Luckily I really fell off the boat on Game of Thrones and I don't feel like I'll ever watch any more of it.

72
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:22,903
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's providing a little bit of context for Stranger Things, which is a Netflix original and I thought it was a really really good Netflix.

73
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, no spoilers till those will spoil a little bit at the end.

74
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:32,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you grew up in the 80s in America, the show is already like a hundred percent up your alley problem.

75
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,627
Speaker 0: so I was really late to the boat on this one.

76
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:48,280
Speaker 0: like a lot of my friends were like watching this and drawn fanart and Twitter was all like nuts about this show last year and I remember my co-workers I think most of them had seen it and they were having like lunch conversations about it.

77
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,311
Speaker 1: I think pretty much everyone I know except my mom who really should see it.

78
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had already seen it.

79
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:05,140
Speaker 0: Yeah like a lot of our buddies had seen it and so I waited a really long time to see it partly because I Was like they were like, yeah, it's disturbing or it's scary and I you know, I'm an anxious person.

80
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:12,480
Speaker 0: I tend not to gravitate towards Stressful like I've got to be in the right mood to watch stressful television.

81
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:22,744
Speaker 0: But like especially horror like horror is incredibly hit or miss for me and you love horror movies But with me it's like some horror movies I love like.

82
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,850
Speaker 0: I really like to get out and I really like.

83
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:26,676
Speaker 0: sometimes I like comedy horror.

84
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:33,820
Speaker 0: I really like Japanese Like the ones that have like a ghost and it's all eerie, you know, it's like supernatural stuff.

85
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:38,160
Speaker 0: But like I was kind of like and not super into horror.

86
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:45,675
Speaker 1: But I was just more simply as much as the show looked like it was Literally everything that I would reference know about care about.

87
00:06:45,716 --> 00:07:00,080
Speaker 1: remember from my childhood The people who were telling me to watch this have also told me to watch a ton of other Similar shows or shows on like Netflix or whatever That were not good or that I didn't care about and I questioned a lot of their tastes.

88
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:00,723
Speaker 1: I wasn't.

89
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:01,928
Speaker 1: it's very.

90
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,699
Speaker 1: it takes a lot to get me to actually watch a show when it comes out.

91
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:09,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if people are raving about it I mean like Jessica Jones was one that our friends were like.

92
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,520
Speaker 0: Oh, you should watch this and we ended up seeing it and it was pretty good.

93
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, but um this one the.

94
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,858
Speaker 0: the thing that made me actually decide to watch it was one.

95
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:34,460
Speaker 0: It was October You know, it was like the season for spooky things and I was like I'm in the mood for spooky you know doesn't come around a lot, but I was in the mood for spooky and Everybody was saying it's got like an early 80s Stephen King vibe and it's very like very nostalgic.

96
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:42,648
Speaker 0: and I was like, well, maybe it's not Exactly to my taste But I think rim will love the heck out of it.

97
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:48,448
Speaker 0: like all the adjectives people were using to describe the show I was like, this is a show for rim.

98
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,880
Speaker 0: And so that's why I was like, oh, let's let's watch it.

99
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,018
Speaker 0: And so and then like the first scene it's a bunch of like twelve-year-old kids in a basement playing D&D.

100
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:07,144
Speaker 1: Is that the kids and it's so rare to see this actually sound and act The way?

101
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:11,700
Speaker 1: I remember sounding and acting when I was a teenager like a young teenager a tween.

102
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:12,764
Speaker 1: it's like they're

103
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:28,489
Speaker 0: kind of goofy and they cuss but they don't cuss like fluidly all the time or like the cusses they have are like Not super Severe, like they'll be like son of a bitch Something and that's like, you know, very emphatic,

104
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,240
Speaker 1: but it's got the right level of like the bigger dependence that kids.

105
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:39,938
Speaker 1: yeah, the error they're setting is like a Little bit before the error when I had sort of full independence of a tween.

106
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:51,616
Speaker 1: Yeah But most of the aesthetic and most of kind of what we were up to was pretty much the same like tooling around on Bikes and coming home late and like parents actually kind of just letting you go do your thing.

107
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:52,740
Speaker 1: and we didn't really have like.

108
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,442
Speaker 1: we had video games, but we didn't have like Internet.

109
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,950
Speaker 1: yet the kids having the CV radios.

110
00:08:58,191 --> 00:08:59,615
Speaker 1: Yeah was like a hundred percent.

111
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,040
Speaker 1: I literally that was me as a kid.

112
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,165
Speaker 1: We had the CV radios.

113
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:02,949
Speaker 0: Didn't you go?

114
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,360
Speaker 0: wasn't there a thing where you'd go on the roof of your house?

115
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,590
Speaker 0: So was that a cordless phone?

116
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,357
Speaker 1: Oh, that was just a cordless.

117
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:13,560
Speaker 0: Yeah But I remember with with me it was a little different because I don't remember the 80s as well.

118
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:53,405
Speaker 0: I was not like the show is set Pretty much around when I was born but like a lot of things ring very true like the group of kids who are like we're gonna go on our bikes and we're gonna like investigate this thing and like the When I was like 13 goofing around with my friends and like the graveyard and stuff like that that it was across the street from my house was like a thing and I don't know it felt There's a certain Element to fiction where may not be true but aspects of it make you feel like it's true even even if like Crazy stuff is happening.

119
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:57,360
Speaker 0: You're like, yeah kids are kind of like that and they bicker like that.

120
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,759
Speaker 0: They're also really loyal like that.

121
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,420
Speaker 1: But they also like if the show were set where they think these things are going on.

122
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,759
Speaker 1: But there isn't actually a supernatural mystery.

123
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,084
Speaker 1: They act the way.

124
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:15,353
Speaker 1: kids that age tend to act like they want to solve mysteries and have the kinds of adventures They remember from like their stories and things they saw on TV or whatever.

125
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,265
Speaker 1: and kids do that Like oh, we'll investigate the thing.

126
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:22,160
Speaker 1: like our friend disappeared and all the adults know that he ran away or drowned or something.

127
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Speaker 1: But the kids like they believe something different happened and they try to figure it out except there actually is a monster.

128
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, this yeah.

129
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:42,540
Speaker 0: Oh and I gotta say one of the things I really liked about this show is that one People people are both skeptical, but they'll also be pragmatic about believing and sharing information.

130
00:10:42,723 --> 00:11:04,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, most you know Talk to each other and you know, you'd think it would be very easy to make this the kind of show where the kids Know there's something creepy going on But no one believes them and they become kind of like this Cassandra like saying doom and all the adults are like, don't worry It's just a bad dream kind of thing this one the adults that are affected by it.

131
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:08,659
Speaker 0: They're like, no, there's something weird going on and we're gonna get to the bottom of this, too.

132
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:19,605
Speaker 1: But they they tackle it in an adult way as opposed to a kid way But to in an adult way with the adults and kids and everyone and this is something at any time Immediately like a show or a movie.

133
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:20,027
Speaker 1: does this?

134
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:20,388
Speaker 1: it just?

135
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:27,340
Speaker 1: it reeks of crappy writing from the 70s and earlier When the whole plot is just oh, there's a misunderstanding or oh no one listen to each other.

136
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:36,960
Speaker 1: Pretty much everyone based on the every character based on the information They have does an appropriate thing at basically all moments.

137
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:46,818
Speaker 1: so like Anytime a new piece like the cop or a mom figures something out or learn something or witnesses something They act in an intelligent way.

138
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,329
Speaker 0: So much an intelligent way cuz.

139
00:11:50,369 --> 00:12:05,360
Speaker 0: like with with Will's mom she's like freaking out and she seems really emotionally unstable, but like she's reacting in an Expected way like an understandable way, like, you know why she's acting like that.

140
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:13,469
Speaker 1: But it's also intelligent because part of the way she's reacting that way is as she expresses herself that no one would believe her Like she's the thing she's seeing and experiencing.

141
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,108
Speaker 1: literally no one would believe her even if she told them Yeah, and she would just sound crazy.

142
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,971
Speaker 0: So she's sort of in this alone Whereas like her son right her older her older son.

143
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,800
Speaker 0: He sees her acting crazy and he acts.

144
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:37,180
Speaker 0: he's like trying to calm her down trying to Like inject some reality into her world, even though he's wrong, you know, it is actually this nonsense that's going on.

145
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:46,484
Speaker 0: he is like the smart rational thing to do if my mom is having a nervous breakdown is Be real with her.

146
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:54,053
Speaker 0: try to calm her down try to get her to stop putting nonsense around the House.

147
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,190
Speaker 0: That was really good.

148
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,940
Speaker 0: that was one of those things where I'm like.

149
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:01,465
Speaker 0: Oh, that's such a great.

150
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:02,869
Speaker 1: the show first came out.

151
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:11,440
Speaker 1: a bunch of people posted this picture and they were like This is why this show is good and it was just a bunch of Christmas lights with like letters painted next to them on the wall.

152
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,865
Speaker 0: No, that was brilliant.

153
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:26,460
Speaker 0: It was like seeing something and coming up with like a clever Solution was is always one of the things that I love in fiction Like when somebody has a problem and they solve it in a really ingenious way.

154
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:31,679
Speaker 0: I was like, that's so smart, you know, and it's just like most I hope I do.

155
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:43,460
Speaker 1: there's so many moments where you could project based on what just happened in a typical sort of Pre-modern era show where from that point the characters would do something stupid or like not tell anyone.

156
00:13:43,742 --> 00:13:55,918
Speaker 1: but in this information gets shared rapidly among characters and They react appropriately and it sounds simple, but that makes this show Like when some characters go and buy a bunch of bear trap.

157
00:13:57,907 --> 00:14:05,880
Speaker 1: That was great And the gun and everything and every point where the plot could veer back into that misunderstanding trope.

158
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:13,020
Speaker 1: It basically takes a hard 180 away from that back to based on information characters act in a reasonable manner.

159
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:19,710
Speaker 0: Well, actually that's the thing that I think Sets it apart from something that I dislike about a lot of horror movies.

160
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,395
Speaker 0: in it in many horror movies.

161
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:30,531
Speaker 0: I've seen the characters React like they freak out and like they'll run away into the woods screaming Oh, no, there's a monster and that you're like don't go in there.

162
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,395
Speaker 0: Don't get the.

163
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,560
Speaker 0: that's a really bad idea.

164
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:43,290
Speaker 0: but like it's like a horror movie where everyone reacts in a fairly Understandable and also usually pretty intelligent manner.

165
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:59,987
Speaker 1: but then you get this interesting situation where you see characters Acting or doing something and you know, like why they're acting that way But the other characters around them don't know and bit by bit everyone who starts to figure out what's going on Seems pretty objectively crazy.

166
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:05,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you were a bystander like watching Will's mom you'd be like, yep She's losing it.

167
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:07,346
Speaker 0: She's having a nervous breakdown.

168
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,873
Speaker 0: poor poor lady lost her son.

169
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:16,974
Speaker 0: That's so sad, you know, and So I I think that's what really kind of set it apart.

170
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:18,780
Speaker 0: for me is that I like the characters.

171
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:21,531
Speaker 0: I think in general the characters are pretty appealing.

172
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:25,525
Speaker 0: not necessarily cuz they're Perfect all the time like.

173
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,980
Speaker 0: sometimes they can be very frustrating but like because they're twins.

174
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,325
Speaker 1: That's the by definition.

175
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:33,836
Speaker 0: how many times to the adults and the teenagers and stuff too.

176
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:44,610
Speaker 0: like all of them I think they make bad decisions and don't always Aren't always like The the nicest or the best.

177
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,656
Speaker 0: but they're like, they're good.

178
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:52,602
Speaker 1: They're good characters Yeah, but also the show moves pretty quickly Like.

179
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:56,054
Speaker 1: it's the kind of show that could meander forever around this vague mystery.

180
00:15:56,074 --> 00:16:05,505
Speaker 1: and I think at least something Material is revealed in every single episode and I like that too that it doesn't have a single antagonist.

181
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:10,456
Speaker 0: there's like there's The monster stuff that's happening like the horror movie stuff that's happening.

182
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,300
Speaker 1: There's the lab stuff.

183
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,630
Speaker 0: There's like government conspiracy stuff, so it's.

184
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:18,600
Speaker 0: it's like the characters aren't just getting it from one angle.

185
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,771
Speaker 0: It's not just like there's a monster on the loose.

186
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:31,379
Speaker 0: There's like weird supernatural stuff, but there's also conspiracy government stuff and those two things combined lead to double danger in a lot of cases.

187
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,000
Speaker 0: and So so who is your favorite character?

188
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,828
Speaker 1: It's hard to say they're pretty great.

189
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,693
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the kids are good.

190
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:44,104
Speaker 1: Yeah both in terms of acting and as characters I just really like them.

191
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:53,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like I I think that Who's the who's the main kid with the shaggy hair?

192
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,293
Speaker 0: Finn Wolfhard is the guy who plays it.

193
00:16:56,374 --> 00:17:02,103
Speaker 1: Yeah, I already forget after names He's the freaking main character Mike Mike.

194
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,069
Speaker 0: Mike, I really do like Mike.

195
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,335
Speaker 0: I thought he was he was good.

196
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:16,535
Speaker 0: Um, I know that's like kind of boring to just pick who's What amounts to the central character, but and I like to love it a lot.

197
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:17,057
Speaker 0: I like that.

198
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:21,477
Speaker 0: she was kind of petulant a lot of times like she was.

199
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:28,116
Speaker 0: She was not just like shell-shocked because she was an experimental subject.

200
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:29,198
Speaker 0: She was also kind of.

201
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:36,060
Speaker 0: Sometimes if she didn't want to do something she'd just be like no and just be like kind of.

202
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:41,020
Speaker 1: Well, kind of like how the kids look at mad and punch each other except she'll do a crazy dangerous psychic.

203
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:47,800
Speaker 0: She'll like, you know slam the door with her mind and you know, she she doesn't really have any social skills.

204
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:48,563
Speaker 0: But she'll.

205
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,771
Speaker 0: she'll be scared.

206
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:56,958
Speaker 0: and because she'll she's scared She'll do things that aren't necessarily helpful, but she'll also be like no.

207
00:17:57,902 --> 00:18:01,980
Speaker 0: I want my way kind of almost like she acts younger.

208
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,880
Speaker 0: She has both younger and older than she actually is because of her isolation.

209
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,646
Speaker 0: So I I liked her.

210
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,037
Speaker 0: I felt really bad for like the scenes where you see her past stuff.

211
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:18,153
Speaker 1: Yeah So but also the the very specific environmental storytelling of her name is 11.

212
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:22,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, very clearly Probably at least 10 more.

213
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:26,440
Speaker 1: I would assume that there's also a 12 and that'll be a big part of the end.

214
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,145
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically we've.

215
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,232
Speaker 0: we've only just started the second season.

216
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:39,453
Speaker 1: So this is a review of the first season and Absolutely going for a while because the one thing much like Cowboy bebop and other great shows that I've liked over the years.

217
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:47,300
Speaker 1: It has this sort of Overarching meta plot but season one pretty much focuses on just the disappearance of Will Byers.

218
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, like how where?

219
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,429
Speaker 1: what happened to him?

220
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:50,613
Speaker 1: What's what's the deal with him?

221
00:18:50,634 --> 00:19:06,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it resolves Pretty interestingly well in a way that makes sense in the broader picture of the story because the story has to continue in this town with These people and it does a pretty clever job of making sure that could continue.

222
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:12,980
Speaker 0: I feel like it's one of those things where it it opens a bunch of questions and it doesn't necessarily answer all the questions.

223
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:18,720
Speaker 0: But it like it definitely leaves a lot of fodder for coming seasons.

224
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:29,151
Speaker 0: But in terms of the main mystery like it solves the plot, you know, you're like, okay How are they gonna get this kid back?

225
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,880
Speaker 0: And that's basically what the entire thing is about.

226
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:37,160
Speaker 0: so So do you want to do spoiler line and like talk about specific scenes?

227
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess we'll just assume that you guys saw it.

228
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,167
Speaker 1: So spoilers past this point.

229
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:45,700
Speaker 1: if you haven't seen it because it's a horror mystery Probably want to see it rather than getting stuff spoiled.

230
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:55,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does use a good mix of horror and mystery tropes Both from modern shows and from media of that era like Stephen King.

231
00:19:55,097 --> 00:20:05,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, so whether or not certain characters survive Certain jump scares and things are actually it's pretty good to go in unknowing like you would when you were a kid.

232
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,187
Speaker 0: People do get killed too.

233
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:07,991
Speaker 0: Like some people.

234
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:10,060
Speaker 1: actually there's a really high body count.

235
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:24,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a lot of people get and like some of them some of them are just like side characters but a lot of times it's very like it sucks because they're just Random bystanders or nice people like like the the guy who helps 11.

236
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:25,058
Speaker 0: You're just like.

237
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:25,239
Speaker 1: no.

238
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think 11 kills more people than anything else though.

239
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:30,820
Speaker 0: No, she's like she is the most dangerous.

240
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,589
Speaker 0: She's like a weapon.

241
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,037
Speaker 1: So yeah spoilers ahead.

242
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:44,000
Speaker 1: Yes It was interesting that the way Ellis gave to she just fucking well first Murdered those other guys instead of murdering the cat and then when she escaped and then all the scenes again.

243
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:50,360
Speaker 1: She is perfectly willing to just kill people directly with her mind and doesn't even appear to feel bad about it.

244
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,271
Speaker 0: But that's what I was saying where you know, I said she laughs.

245
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,003
Speaker 1: he murders all those FBI agents or whatever Like like.

246
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:06,860
Speaker 0: they just fall over convulsing with blood coming out of their eyes and stuff like that and like she snapped people's necks And like she causes a heck ton of car accidents and stuff.

247
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:21,749
Speaker 0: She but that's what I'm saying where it's like she seems both younger and older than she is but I think part of the thing that makes her seem like a little kid is because like her moral Compass isn't necessarily the most developed.

248
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,574
Speaker 0: like she she's very.

249
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:25,118
Speaker 0: her focus is very narrow.

250
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,359
Speaker 0: She will Really?

251
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:38,971
Speaker 0: Try hard to protect the people who are friends like she has a very narrow Group of people who she trusts and then everybody else she doesn't care.

252
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:41,637
Speaker 0: She's just like, yep, if you blow up whatever.

253
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:47,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, and So she can be a little selfish or like lacking empathy.

254
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:55,269
Speaker 0: but like do you blame her given the fact that she like grew up as a lab subject and was Like exposed to all these horrible experiments.

255
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they would like trying to make her blow up cats and stuff like that.

256
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:11,063
Speaker 1: I mean like serious But I like the sort of subtle story that she didn't blow up the cat and then she lashed out when he had when her fake father had her thrown into solitary confinement and then she murdered two of her Guards instead.

257
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:14,014
Speaker 1: and then the dad guy is just like oh cool.

258
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:15,580
Speaker 1: My experiment was a success.

259
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,320
Speaker 1: She can murder people with her mind, but like he's clearly happy that he got the answer to the question.

260
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,550
Speaker 1: He didn't care if a cat died or a person died.

261
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,760
Speaker 1: He just wanted to know the answer to that quest.

262
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,020
Speaker 0: I don't even I kind of wonder if he's gonna come back because it was implied that he got eaten by the monster.

263
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,903
Speaker 0: But they didn't show it.

264
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:36,940
Speaker 1: and the trope of me from that era if you don't see someone you don't see them die.

265
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,943
Speaker 0: They might come back.

266
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,568
Speaker 1: They're almost definitely not dead.

267
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:43,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the the monster is actually really scary.

268
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,877
Speaker 0: It's like those uh, those wolves from that anime we watched a long time.

269
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:48,660
Speaker 0: the brave story.

270
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:54,806
Speaker 0: Oh remember he's like nice doggy and then it's its face opens like a flower Like that's.

271
00:22:55,128 --> 00:23:03,620
Speaker 0: that's the monster it like has a mouth but it's like its head just opens up as like this huge carnivorous flower and it will just be like.

272
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:18,080
Speaker 1: and but I love that bit where the teenagers the legit teenagers get together and Just they go and buy like all the bear traps and they make the fire bomb and they literally are ready to just murder the thing.

273
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:23,195
Speaker 0: You know Their booby trap was really their booby trap was another thing where I was like.

274
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,620
Speaker 0: that is a good plan.

275
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,310
Speaker 0: That's a smart plan except that the bear trap it was like.

276
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,019
Speaker 0: I was like, oh no, they have to jump over it.

277
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:39,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, oh no, but then when boyfriend Oh shows up Oh my favorite sad bad boyfriend Steve Steve shows up and you're kind of like.

278
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:44,480
Speaker 0: He's not the worst but he's kind of a douchebag like he's like douchebag.

279
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:49,060
Speaker 1: Yep, you're supposed to come around like especially as he sort of ditches his other loser.

280
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, like his friends are the worst right, but he also goes along with him and he's kind of like her.

281
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:54,800
Speaker 0: her her.

282
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,646
Speaker 1: He comes in and they're gonna fight the monster.

283
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:57,249
Speaker 1: He's like what.

284
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,252
Speaker 0: he's like what what?

285
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:01,263
Speaker 1: and they pull the gun and he's like Ah, what.

286
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,060
Speaker 0: and so he comes in and he sees this house.

287
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:17,880
Speaker 1: That's like rigged up with bear traps and like the one He's got spiked bat and like the guy he thinks is probably a serial killer His girlfriend has a gun and they're telling him to get the fuck out.

288
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,420
Speaker 0: He's like something real bad is going on and then the monster comes out of the wall and he just flips out.

289
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:43,585
Speaker 0: I I love Times like that where a character who hasn't thus far been introduced to any of the like terrible secret That's happening in like a fantasy Sci-fi thing gets it all at once like Surprise, and that was that was really excellent because he was being a pain in the neck And then he was freaking

290
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:43,867
Speaker 1: out.

291
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:46,419
Speaker 1: great also because he he stepped up.

292
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:53,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, he actually was helpful and when Jonathan was in danger He was like he saved Jonathan's life.

293
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:55,212
Speaker 0: So I was like good on you Steve.

294
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,539
Speaker 0: You're not so so jerky after all.

295
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,829
Speaker 1: I really like the bit by bit as hopper.

296
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:09,080
Speaker 1: The cop starts to figure things out and follow the thread I like when he was checking his apartment for bugs or he does it in such it once again.

297
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,654
Speaker 1: Like even when he's alone, it's the kind of thing that crazy people do.

298
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:14,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then he finds it.

299
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:22,388
Speaker 0: He's he's like trash in his apartment and you're like or his his house and you're like Oh, like is he gonna find it?

300
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:26,020
Speaker 0: and then he finds like an actual microphone on the lamp.

301
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:29,556
Speaker 1: But then he's already go straight to the what's-her-name's house, mrs.

302
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:29,716
Speaker 1: Byers.

303
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then he comes in the door and like and then they work together.

304
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that that was the very satisfying thing.

305
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,969
Speaker 0: once the two groups start consolidating like once Oh really three groups.

306
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,632
Speaker 1: It was it was Those two would be figured out.

307
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:47,860
Speaker 1: then there was the teenagers.

308
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:51,340
Speaker 1: They'd figured a bunch out and then there was the kids and all three groups came together.

309
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they immediately are like, well let's minority report.

310
00:25:55,714 --> 00:26:01,675
Speaker 0: and yeah, well they had the the sensory deprivation tank thing.

311
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:09,112
Speaker 0: that was another like kind of jerry-rigged smart solution to a problem.

312
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:12,306
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I also.

313
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:25,299
Speaker 1: one of the things I like about the show is just the production design is really really good The framings good the scene transitions are not only great, but they're very reminiscent of horror like movies from the 80s.

314
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,940
Speaker 0: Well, you said like the soundtrack not just the the music they lay crappy synthesizers are educating.

315
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:37,584
Speaker 1: Yeah I was on that panel at magfest with the dude who wrote like and and performed like half the horror Soundtracks from the 80s.

316
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:43,460
Speaker 1: and this dude he was talking about how they the studios he worked with often couldn't afford modern synthesizers.

317
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:52,887
Speaker 1: So what he do is he would manually use the synthesizer and like play the arpeggios and he manually do it to record the Soundtrack like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

318
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:56,740
Speaker 1: The whole soundtrack is that 80s horror synth arpeggiating in the background.

319
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, and but not just that like the lighting.

320
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:05,235
Speaker 0: I just like a lot of the props and set designs as well much like Fargo.

321
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:06,920
Speaker 1: It's a period piece

322
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:07,068
Speaker 0: Yeah

323
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:23,648
Speaker 1: but and that and you don't need to know the period like you don't need to get there's a million references to like Stephen King and Steven Spielberg like they're everywhere, but you don't need to pick out specific ones because together they just set this very Like early 80s vibe, but the

324
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:24,731
Speaker 0: thing is like Fargo.

325
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:27,620
Speaker 0: that was something I really appreciated about Fargo.

326
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, too, but this one is much closer to home.

327
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,709
Speaker 0: This one is one I identify with a lot more.

328
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:36,200
Speaker 1: I grew up in the tail end of that era.

329
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,812
Speaker 0: Well something you also noticed too is like talking about environmental.

330
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:43,304
Speaker 0: storytelling is like how the different characters Socio-economic.

331
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,354
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, look at like everywhere told to their houses.

332
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:50,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, the houses in the suburbs Tell you everything about these families.

333
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:52,680
Speaker 0: like like Steve's the boyfriend.

334
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:58,219
Speaker 0: he's definitely like his family's rich and they have like this rich kind of yuppie house.

335
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:08,093
Speaker 0: and With Like my normal house Mike Mike has the like suburban split-level, right?

336
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:16,563
Speaker 1: It's like totally that 70s And the buyers have the like rundown house in the pre-subdivision and yeah It's like the.

337
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:22,660
Speaker 1: those specific like straight Asians of society were around me as a kid in the suburbs in the Midwest.

338
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally and they really stood out like it because I knew kids from like from every one of those kinds of houses.

339
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:35,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think all all told the the CG stuff was really good.

340
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,167
Speaker 0: I liked when they'd go into the alternate dimension and it had the really spooky lighting and Actually, that was.

341
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:55,961
Speaker 0: I don't know how They did it, but I I want to say that it was actually probably not super Crazy, like they probably put a lot of filters over like the forest and everything There was.

342
00:28:56,102 --> 00:29:00,136
Speaker 0: there was a ton of CG animation, but it's not like they created that from scratch.

343
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:23,686
Speaker 0: I Assume, you know, I don't actually know I haven't seen like a enough Compositing breakdown or anything, but it's like a lot of it is just like weird lighting like weird overlays and it just like takes the forest or takes the arcade or takes like some place and makes it just really creepy and dusty and It's pretty neat.

344
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:26,680
Speaker 1: It's also just the the normal like non upside down places.

345
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:28,660
Speaker 1: They said when they weren't doing something creepy.

346
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:34,760
Speaker 1: They evoked that nostalgia in a powerful way kind of like that San Junipero episode of Black Mirror.

347
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,750
Speaker 0: I haven't seen black.

348
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:36,539
Speaker 0: you should see it.

349
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,001
Speaker 0: I will.

350
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:43,402
Speaker 1: it very similarly even if you don't know anything about the 80s say like just like this like specific References.

351
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:49,680
Speaker 1: just you see the way things are lit and the way people are dressed and it just it puts together this setting very well.

352
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:51,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah, I'm.

353
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:59,614
Speaker 1: uh season two seems to just be continuing Exactly in the vein of season one and I have no complaints about one year later kind of thing.

354
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,520
Speaker 0: It's it's the yeah, I was born.

355
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,390
