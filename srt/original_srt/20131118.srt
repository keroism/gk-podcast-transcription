1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,588
Speaker 0: It's Monday, November 18th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,490
Speaker 0: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:13,533
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:16,120
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, streaming live.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,219
Speaker 0: Streaming live.

6
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:18,505
Speaker 1: Mom.

7
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,979
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,482
Speaker 0: Alright, go ahead.

9
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:24,027
Speaker 1: You're way too excited for Monday.

10
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:25,191
Speaker 0: I'm not that excited.

11
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:26,797
Speaker 1: You're being loud and eh.

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,632
Speaker 0: How am I being- I'm not being really any different from how I normally am.

13
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:33,080
Speaker 1: Eh, quiet down.

14
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:34,682
Speaker 0: What are you?

15
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:36,309
Speaker 0: You got a case of the Mondays, Garfield?

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,373
Speaker 0: Monday no good?

17
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:38,898
Speaker 1: I need some lasagna?

18
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,260
Speaker 1: I don't know.

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,412
Speaker 1: This morning, I think it started off bad because I was making some breakfast.

20
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,678
Speaker 0: Wait, Juan, making breakfast, that's your mistake.

21
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:51,420
Speaker 1: Dude, I bought a package of bacon, and I just been making bacon every day.

22
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:55,620
Speaker 0: I do not have the wherewithal to get up early in the morning and make anything.

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,439
Speaker 1: I just have a pan, and I put fire under it, and I put the bacon in it, and that's it.

24
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:01,806
Speaker 0: See, I make bacon for dinner.

25
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,875
Speaker 0: I'll take bacon and like wrap it around a spera.

26
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:04,919
Speaker 1: I might do that, too.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,762
Speaker 1: You should do that.

28
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:06,928
Speaker 1: You know, I'm only one person.

29
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,360
Speaker 1: A whole package of bacon is so much bacon.

30
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,236
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I was making some English muffin, and you know, you cut a muffin in half over the sink.

31
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:16,720
Speaker 0: Juan, you don't cut, you tear.

32
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:17,962
Speaker 1: What?

33
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:19,991
Speaker 0: English muffins are already perforated.

34
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:20,794
Speaker 0: Just tear it in two.

35
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:23,907
Speaker 1: No, because I got the high, high density English muffins.

36
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:25,212
Speaker 0: Even then, just tear it in two.

37
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,160
Speaker 0: That way you have nice nooks and crannies.

38
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:28,845
Speaker 0: You don't want a clean cut.

39
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:34,040
Speaker 1: The clean cut still has nooks and crannies due to the nature of an English muffin.

40
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Speaker 1: The nook and cranny is identical.

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,401
Speaker 0: I would argue.

42
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,710
Speaker 1: You just lose less crumbs if you cut it with a knife.

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,220
Speaker 0: But the crumbs stay in if you tear it off effectively.

44
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,946
Speaker 0: You're just bad at this.

45
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:48,100
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm cutting it over the sink, so crumbs fall in the sink.

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,351
Speaker 1: All right, and then I drop the English muffin in the sink.

47
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:51,940
Speaker 0: Was it your last English muffin?

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,780
Speaker 1: No, but they only come in even numbers, so now I have only, that one was no good, so I got rid of it because it was full.

49
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:03,540
Speaker 0: Wait, how do them coming in even numbers in any way impact your use of them?

50
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,840
Speaker 1: Well, because I lost one, and I had to eat two, so now there's only one left.

51
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,412
Speaker 1: So even though I buy another package, I'll have seven.

52
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:11,680
Speaker 0: So you eat two per day?

53
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't eat one at a time.

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,040
Speaker 1: So now it's like I'll always have like this one oddball English muffin unless someone comes to my house to eat it or something.

55
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,880
Speaker 0: You know, sometimes when I come home from work, I'll just toast an English muffin and put some butter on it.

56
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,378
Speaker 1: Just one?

57
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,706
Speaker 1: Yeah.

58
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,211
Speaker 1: Aren't you hungry after?

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you know what I do after we do Yink Nights?

60
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:32,920
Speaker 0: I make dinner.

61
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:34,039
Speaker 1: No, I can't.

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,778
Speaker 0: It's just a snack.

63
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, and one English muffin is not.

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,811
Speaker 0: One English muffin is a snack.

65
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:38,880
Speaker 0: It's like eating some crackers.

66
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,225
Speaker 1: Daddy two English muffin.

67
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,480
Speaker 1: There's a reason they're stacked up too high in the package.

68
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:44,069
Speaker 1: So.

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,159
Speaker 1: I think it even says serving size two muffins.

70
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:50,760
Speaker 0: So well, the other option, Scott, is to get the gigantic English muffins instead.

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,420
Speaker 0: They come in four packs and they're twice as big as a single English muffin.

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Speaker 1: But then if I drop one in the sink, that's even worse.

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,160
Speaker 0: But then you don't have this even odd disparity.

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
Speaker 0: You're just down one and nothing else changes.

75
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,006
Speaker 1: That's correct.

76
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:02,980
Speaker 1: But I've lost so much.

77
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,037
Speaker 0: Imagine Homer talking to Dr.

78
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,640
Speaker 1: You're putting more eggs and less baskets.

79
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,025
Speaker 0: It's like Homer talking to Dr.

80
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,800
Speaker 0: Hibbert when he was like, we could cut off the other's thumb for symmetry.

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, symmetry.

82
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:11,438
Speaker 1: Exactly.

83
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:21,320
Speaker 0: So, uh, having my glass, I have to say that your experience of people asking you dumb questions has not been my experience.

84
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,759
Speaker 1: I think my theory is that it's where you work.

85
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,840
Speaker 1: I work in tourist town and you work.

86
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,879
Speaker 0: I work in like downtown in Tribeca, like financial, like right next to World Trade Center, where all the exchanges and all the B.S.

87
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,079
Speaker 0: is.

88
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's different people down there.

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:45,760
Speaker 0: But the best questions I got were from this punk kid like this, this most thuggy looking like little punk kid who was just having some sort of fight with one of his other punk kid friends.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,479
Speaker 0: You know, punk kids doing their punk kid thing.

91
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,500
Speaker 0: And he's like, whoa, is that Google Glass?

92
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,465
Speaker 0: And he comes over.

93
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,118
Speaker 1: So he did ask if that was Google Glass.

94
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:53,510
Speaker 0: But he knew the answer.

95
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,320
Speaker 0: Is that Google Glass?

96
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,204
Speaker 0: Oh, shit, man.

97
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:58,380
Speaker 0: And then he starts asking me all these specific questions about it.

98
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,180
Speaker 0: Like, how's the screen look?

99
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,440
Speaker 0: Is it as high res as they say?

100
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,339
Speaker 0: Can you see the pixels?

101
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:11,860
Speaker 0: Like he starts asking these really specific and detailed that specific that that was the beginning because he saw the resolution online and, you know, the documentation that's out there.

102
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:13,620
Speaker 0: And he was like, can you see the pixels?

103
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,678
Speaker 0: Like how far away does the screen look like it is?

104
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:17,858
Speaker 0: Do you turn it on all the time?

105
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,279
Speaker 0: Is it only on when you're doing stuff?

106
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,038
Speaker 0: Can you make vines with it?

107
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,439
Speaker 1: No, you can't make vines.

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,640
Speaker 1: That's going to be a killer act.

109
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,100
Speaker 0: The only thing is useful for the vine people that are making app day one.

110
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,760
Speaker 0: They better already be working on the vine.

111
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,235
Speaker 1: It's Twitter and they have the Twitter app.

112
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,080
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I fixed my Twitter thing.

113
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,380
Speaker 1: People may not know there's a hidden feature of Twitter that I learned about.

114
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:44,860
Speaker 1: Go to Twitter on the website and go to click on your own profile and then delete the account and that will make Twitter more usable.

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,260
Speaker 1: And then click on the part where it lists everyone that you are following.

116
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:48,683
Speaker 1: Right.

117
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,780
Speaker 1: So it's the big list of everyone that you are following.

118
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,660
Speaker 1: And then next to each person will be a little picture of a person.

119
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:54,062
Speaker 1: Right.

120
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,920
Speaker 1: The person icon that looks like a Fisher Price Main Street person.

121
00:04:57,543 --> 00:04:59,300
Speaker 1: And you click on that as a little pull down menu.

122
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,520
Speaker 1: And one of the items in that pull down menu is turn mobile notifications on or off.

123
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:11,340
Speaker 1: You can turn on mobile notifications, for example, on, say, the PAX Twitter account.

124
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Speaker 1: So every time it tweets, no matter what, you'll get a notification just as if they were to say at message you or direct message you.

125
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,040
Speaker 1: And you can basically make certain Twitter accounts like higher priority.

126
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,900
Speaker 1: So you'll just always get notified by them no matter what, because those are like tweeting important things.

127
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:27,441
Speaker 1: Right.

128
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:33,780
Speaker 1: So I somehow was getting all these tweets on my Google Glass and I didn't know why.

129
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,019
Speaker 1: And that's why I stopped using the Twitter app on Google Glass.

130
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,040
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I had curated that configuration extensively.

131
00:05:39,342 --> 00:05:40,299
Speaker 1: I didn't even know it existed.

132
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:50,260
Speaker 1: And then apparently I don't even know how some of the oldest it seems like probably early on when I was using Twitter, every person I was following had that no matter what.

133
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,135
Speaker 1: It's like my 10 oldest things I've been following.

134
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:53,799
Speaker 1: all had that.

135
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:58,540
Speaker 1: So I had to go and I found out and I was like, oh, and I turned them all off.

136
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,879
Speaker 1: And now everything is cool.

137
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:01,144
Speaker 1: Yeah.

138
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still using it.

139
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,520
Speaker 0: I still I found now that it looks like the relationship between Rochester Optical and Google is a semi-official.

140
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,719
Speaker 0: Like I saw some press releases.

141
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:13,619
Speaker 0: They're going to have prescription glasses official through them.

142
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,480
Speaker 1: Too bad you don't have your free prescription glass money anymore.

143
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I still have an FSA that I put money into pre-tax.

144
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't put any money in there.

145
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:37,881
Speaker 0: But I don't know if I want to wait till January to get non because right now the fake lens, like the lenses I put in to make this work that I just had laying around my ski goggle inserts, they look like glasses that a dad would wear if he was nerdy in 1982.

146
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:44,960
Speaker 0: So I might get an optician to make me custom lenses ahead of January because I don't want to wear it looking like this for the next two months.

147
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,360
Speaker 0: And I do want to wear it at MAGFest.

148
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,839
Speaker 1: Oh, and you just get laser eye.

149
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,379
Speaker 0: Because they say if you get lazy, you shouldn't use Google Glass.

150
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:53,172
Speaker 1: What?

151
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:53,520
Speaker 0: Why not?

152
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,160
Speaker 0: Google straight up warns against it.

153
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,380
Speaker 0: It says, talk to your optician seriously or your optometrist, actually.

154
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,019
Speaker 0: Don't use Google Glass if you got LASIK unless your optometrist says it's OK.

155
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,639
Speaker 1: What could possibly happen?

156
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,627
Speaker 0: Well, LASIK causes a few issues with your.

157
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:12,680
Speaker 0: I mean, they basically change the shape of the outside of your eye, the cornea.

158
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,558
Speaker 0: They don't change the lens.

159
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,345
Speaker 0: So there's some issues.

160
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:19,600
Speaker 0: like my mom got the old radial carotonymy and she lost a lot of her night vision.

161
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,640
Speaker 0: She'll get lens flares when they're bright lights at night, like on the road.

162
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,319
Speaker 0: That's just a trade off.

163
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:27,440
Speaker 0: Also, my vision is pretty bad.

164
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,960
Speaker 0: So I have a higher risk of failure for LASIK.

165
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,240
Speaker 1: It's a new eyeball.

166
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:32,946
Speaker 0: That's coming someday.

167
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,140
Speaker 0: I think in my lifetime I get new eyeball, Bato Eyes.

168
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,500
Speaker 1: I'll sign up for Bato Eyes, even though mine are perfectly fine.

169
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,200
Speaker 0: Because Bato Eyes look fucking awesome.

170
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,319
Speaker 1: Plus, would you really help Netrunner if people can't tell what cards I'm looking at?

171
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,639
Speaker 0: Just wear sunglasses like those poker people do.

172
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,598
Speaker 1: Not doing that.

173
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,098
Speaker 0: Why not?

174
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,018
Speaker 1: No one does that.

175
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,420
Speaker 0: So you would replace your flesh and blood eyes with cybernetic Bato Eyes, but you wouldn't put on a pair of sunglasses.

176
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,939
Speaker 1: Indoors, you would look really fucking stupid if you did that.

177
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,540
Speaker 0: I kind of often wear sunglasses indoors.

178
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,280
Speaker 0: It's really comfortable.

179
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:19,045
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the news, I got two related things here that are related in a way that's tangential, because the core issue is that phone numbers, you know, phone numbers, like the number you use to dial someone on a phone, are obsolete.

180
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,638
Speaker 0: And I really wish they'd just go away.

181
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,280
Speaker 0: Like, they're sort of this link to a legacy world that no longer needs to exist.

182
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,478
Speaker 0: We just don't have a good...

183
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,871
Speaker 1: We could have it obscured by some sort of system.

184
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,740
Speaker 1: the same way DNS obscures IP addresses.

185
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,480
Speaker 0: We could.

186
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:47,940
Speaker 0: Or we could have a system where you register an email address and that email address is your phone number for all intents and purposes and have some laws to make sure that all voice over IP or voice landline or cell phone, whatever, carriers have to respect and use it.

187
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,620
Speaker 0: But I digress.

188
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,000
Speaker 0: Two things that are happening with phone numbers right now are kind of interesting.

189
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,180
Speaker 0: One, there's an article on Slashdot about giving phone numbers a reputation score.

190
00:08:59,702 --> 00:08:59,897
Speaker 1: Okay.

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,160
Speaker 1: You need a database of all phone numbers.

192
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,600
Speaker 0: Yep.

193
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:21,619
Speaker 0: Now, the idea is, and it seems like there's a couple of companies who want to try to do this, is that if you have phone numbers and let people flag them as spam and not spam and sort of gather data long enough, you could pretty much do what Gmail does to phones and just automatically block all those calls from the Democrats asking for money.

194
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:28,340
Speaker 0: So I really look forward to this future and all the people who are complaining about the privacy of this.

196
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,705
Speaker 0: Shut up.

197
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:29,500
Speaker 1: Yeah.

198
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:37,799
Speaker 0: I care more about not getting spam than I care about the privacy of a five to nine digit number that can be used to send audio to me.

199
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,560
Speaker 1: Same goes for everyone complaining about Google Plus comments on YouTube.

200
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:42,551
Speaker 1: Same deal.

201
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:43,160
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

202
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,780
Speaker 0: The Google Plus comments on YouTube thing.

203
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:57,640
Speaker 0: I, I would be with you guys from an ideological standpoint, except that the YouTube comment, I don't know, world ecosystem has proven that it is the bottom of humanity.

204
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:58,939
Speaker 0: So fuck you guys.

205
00:09:59,201 --> 00:09:59,562
Speaker 1: Yeah.

206
00:09:59,582 --> 00:09:59,842
Speaker 1: Right.

207
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:05,619
Speaker 0: It's like if you want to comment anonymously on a YouTube video, that's a stupid thing to do anyway.

208
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,460
Speaker 0: Comment anonymously on your anonymous blog about that YouTube video.

209
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,987
Speaker 1: What is the point?

210
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:12,797
Speaker 1: Nobody will read it.

211
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:13,907
Speaker 0: Exactly.

212
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,420
Speaker 0: Nobody reads it on YouTube anyway.

213
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,960
Speaker 0: The net result is identical.

214
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,901
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

215
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:26,400
Speaker 0: Seriously, the people complaining about this are like, like they're appropriating all the words that actual freedom movements have used.

216
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:30,540
Speaker 0: And I'm just waiting for them to start using images of Shay to fight the oppression.

217
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:46,700
Speaker 0: But no, the other thing Google is doing that's scaring a lot of people, again, kind of unduly, I think, is there's a lot of buzz that with the new version of Android, they're going to use their own database to generate caller ID for you instead of using the phone system's database.

218
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,519
Speaker 1: Well, you can fall back on the phone system.

219
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the people aren't mad that they're going to get the data.

220
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:54,899
Speaker 0: They're mad that their data is going to be used to populate it.

221
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,500
Speaker 1: So basically, if I call, they're going to look at your contact list and they're going to know, no, it's pretty simple.

222
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:14,045
Speaker 0: If you ever used a registered a phone number with Google for any reason, like if you authorized a super big YouTube account or something like a special thing or to like a recovery phone number for your Google voice or your Gmail,

223
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:17,279
Speaker 1: if you give someone information, they have it and they're going to use it.

224
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:17,662
Speaker 0: Yep.

225
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,519
Speaker 0: So the way they're going to use it, he didn't want to use it.

226
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:21,320
Speaker 1: Don't tell him to them in the first place.

227
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,980
Speaker 0: So if you ever call anyone with that phone number and they're using.

228
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,498
Speaker 1: Graham, I want to keep a secret from you.

229
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:27,265
Speaker 1: Right.

230
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,437
Speaker 1: So now I'm going to tell it to you.

231
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:36,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to tell you a secret by wrapping it in an encrypted container and then giving it to you without the private key with which to decrypt it.

232
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,659
Speaker 0: That's how you give someone a secret without giving it to them.

233
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,939
Speaker 0: But then I'd notice how I didn't tell Scott the info.

234
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,941
Speaker 0: But I digress.

235
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:57,140
Speaker 0: So if I call Scott and he has the new Android, then he will see a caller ID with my name and my Google Plus profile and all that stuff, even if my caller ID information was otherwise spoofed or wrong.

236
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:04,620
Speaker 0: Again, I'm totally OK with this because I don't think phone numbers have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

237
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:15,969
Speaker 0: I also think that the sort of the fact that we don't have access lists or any sort of controls to easily block and forward and reroute phone numbers like we can with everything

238
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:16,229
Speaker 1: else

239
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:29,380
Speaker 0: means that any loss of privacy is more than a billion times over, brought back in returns on the fact that I can use this information to not answer phones, phone calls that are from the Democrats.

240
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,540
Speaker 0: They seem to call me more than anyone.

241
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,439
Speaker 0: That's what I get for giving money to Obama back in.

242
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,900
Speaker 1: I finally have reached a point where I get no calls.

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,360
Speaker 1: I don't get snail mails.

244
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,380
Speaker 1: Well, part of it is I did nothing for the longest time.

245
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,000
Speaker 0: I had that Google Plus, not Google Plus, Google Voice integration through Sprint.

246
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,080
Speaker 0: So my phone number was a Google Voice number, but it was also my main number and my phone integrated with that.

247
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,220
Speaker 0: So I had spam blocking and all those things through Google Voice.

248
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:54,359
Speaker 0: But now I'm on Timo again.

249
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:57,080
Speaker 0: That whole deal with Sprint seems to have disappeared.

250
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:05,260
Speaker 0: And now I get all those phone calls that Google has been flagging and blocking for the last couple of years, mostly calls from the Democrats.

251
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:05,967
Speaker 1: All right.

252
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:06,840
Speaker 1: Don't give people money.

253
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the moral.

254
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:09,399
Speaker 0: Never give the Democrats money.

255
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,120
Speaker 1: So I bought this iPad Mini Retina.

256
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,940
Speaker 1: And the reason I bought it is because it's statistically well, not as easily.

257
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,020
Speaker 1: It does, period, have the best screen that a consumer can buy with money.

258
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:24,745
Speaker 1: Right.

259
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,360
Speaker 1: That is pretty good, right?

260
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,240
Speaker 1: In terms of pixels per inch and, you know, everything, every, you know, resolution.

261
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,799
Speaker 1: I mean, there are more pixels in this tiny thing than there are on your giant Dell right there.

262
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,241
Speaker 0: Yep.

263
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:41,280
Speaker 0: Never mind all anyone who thinks that 1080p is high resolution.

264
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,409
Speaker 1: Seriously.

265
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:42,675
Speaker 1: Right.

266
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:49,159
Speaker 1: So, you know, just the fact that the screen exists, I probably would have bought just the screen if there was nothing attached to it.

267
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,280
Speaker 1: Just like, oh, here, have a screen, plug it into whatever you want.

268
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,640
Speaker 0: If I could buy a retina monitor right now for less than like two thousand dollars.

269
00:13:55,861 --> 00:14:03,220
Speaker 1: Even this little tiny one, I would have bought four of these tiny ones and then made something that hook them up together in like a quad situation.

270
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,306
Speaker 0: Hell, I'd get rid of this giant goddamn monitor.

271
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:09,380
Speaker 0: I got here and just hang a retina display in front of my face and use that as my monitor.

272
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,081
Speaker 1: Right.

273
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:14,800
Speaker 1: I mean, this is it's basically the iPad Mini with retina is the same iPad as the iPad Air.

274
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:18,800
Speaker 1: It's only smaller, which means it's better because it has the same resolution.

275
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,580
Speaker 1: So the pixels are just, you know, much, much smaller.

276
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:24,720
Speaker 1: But there's just as many of them and the CPU is the same.

277
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,720
Speaker 1: It's just like underclocked, like a like a tiny, insignificant amount and is otherwise identical.

278
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,439
Speaker 1: So I don't see any reason to get the big one.

279
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:32,959
Speaker 1: It even weighs less than the big one.

280
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:35,660
Speaker 1: So the thing is, I want to warn people.

281
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:36,162
Speaker 1: Right.

282
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,900
Speaker 1: Why did I get an iPad and already had an iPhone and all this other stuff?

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
Speaker 1: Well, the reason is because I wanted to use it.

284
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,260
Speaker 1: I know I already said this before, but it's like, yeah, what would an iPad do for me?

285
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,348
Speaker 1: It would be more comfortable in bed and such like.

286
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:54,660
Speaker 1: every morning I wake up and I poke my phone and every night before I go to bed, I poke my phone.

287
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:59,900
Speaker 1: Now it's more comfortable to do so because it's slightly larger to use an iPad than an iPhone.

288
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:13,240
Speaker 1: And also, if I'm doing computing, that doesn't involve, say, doing a presentation at a convention or coding or doing anything for reals, then it's much smaller to carry around this tiny iPad.

289
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,840
Speaker 1: So basically, I have to do a podcast than a giant laptop.

290
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:18,420
Speaker 0: Any time you're looking at stuff as opposed to making stuff.

291
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,083
Speaker 1: Exactly.

292
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:22,180
Speaker 1: If I don't need a keyboard, this thing is way smaller than the laptop.

293
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,178
Speaker 1: So my load is much, much lightened.

294
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:24,801
Speaker 1: Right.

295
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:32,300
Speaker 1: And the other thing is I can do cool stuff like there are certain things that use my phone for or it's better to use the iPad for.

296
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,220
Speaker 1: Like if I use my iPhone, I take pictures on my camera and then the camera sends the pictures to the phone.

297
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:45,080
Speaker 1: Well, now I can take pictures on my camera and send the pictures to the iPad where it's much easier to Photoshop them with the iPad Photoshop.

298
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,783
Speaker 1: Right.

299
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,819
Speaker 1: So I learned some things.

300
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:48,541
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:56,600
Speaker 1: Thing I learned number one, iPad apps and iPhone apps aren't necessarily the same.

302
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,087
Speaker 0: That is true.

303
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,780
Speaker 0: I have heard that from other people before.

304
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,900
Speaker 1: Sometimes, for example, you'll have a bad situation where I bought the real Photoshop for my iPhone.

305
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:10,180
Speaker 1: I go and I try to get the real Photoshop for iPad.

306
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:14,120
Speaker 1: No, that's a completely separate app, even though they're both called Photoshop Touch or whatever.

307
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:15,690
Speaker 1: They're completely separate.

308
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,880
Speaker 1: to buy both of them separately.

309
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:18,083
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

310
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,920
Speaker 1: I bought it anyway because that was one of the number one reasons I bought this thing.

311
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,523
Speaker 1: But fuck you.

312
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:25,120
Speaker 0: That appears to not be the case with any Android apps.

313
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:27,340
Speaker 1: And it has a lot of creative cloud integrations and stuff.

314
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,159
Speaker 1: So, you know, and like Adobe idea, that's free.

315
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:31,150
Speaker 1: So it's like it's all right.

316
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:31,474
Speaker 1: Right.

317
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,739
Speaker 1: OK, so fuck you on that, too.

318
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,480
Speaker 1: Some apps are only iPhone apps.

319
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,240
Speaker 1: So it's like I want Delicious on here.

320
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,260
Speaker 1: That way I can like bring up a thing of the day I saved.

321
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,284
Speaker 1: It's like, nope.

322
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,980
Speaker 1: So I just got to go to it in the Web browser because the Delicious app is an iPhone app.

323
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,807
Speaker 1: It's not an iPad app.

324
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,998
Speaker 1: So fuck you.

325
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,480
Speaker 1: Three, some things are iPad apps and not iPhone apps.

326
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,760
Speaker 1: One time, Puerto Rico, the board game was on sale.

327
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,780
Speaker 1: So I bought it for like a dollar and then it wouldn't install on my iPhone.

328
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,485
Speaker 1: And I was like, fuck.

329
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,560
Speaker 1: And now that I have an iPad, it installed.

330
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,346
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, right.

331
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,200
Speaker 1: I bought that for a dollar because it's on sale.

332
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,839
Speaker 1: Now the user interface on it is God awful.

333
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,999
Speaker 1: Is it's pretty much play Puerto Rico in an emergency.

334
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

335
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:10,883
Speaker 0: You know what?

336
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:12,979
Speaker 0: Play Puerto Rico with a physical board, guys.

337
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:13,483
Speaker 0: Yeah.

338
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:16,339
Speaker 1: And then there are some good situations, though.

339
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 1: Neuroshima Hacks, same app, works on both the interface.

340
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,339
Speaker 1: Just it's the same exact app, just bigger.

341
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,160
Speaker 1: It's when it plays on iPad.

342
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,580
Speaker 1: It actually the interface is different slightly, but better because it's bigger.

343
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:30,203
Speaker 1: Right.

344
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,120
Speaker 1: As the same app and I paid for it already.

345
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,126
Speaker 1: So I had to pay for it again.

346
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,940
Speaker 1: I didn't have to pay for the armies again.

347
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:36,325
Speaker 1: It was just.

348
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:37,339
Speaker 1: it's the same app.

349
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,820
Speaker 1: It just looks different on the different devices of different sizes properly.

350
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,898
Speaker 1: So you don't have to pay for it again and again and again.

351
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:44,712
Speaker 1: And good job.

352
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:45,360
Speaker 1: Neuroshima Hacks.

353
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:45,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

354
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:46,669
Speaker 1: A plus.

355
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:47,133
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:49,082
Speaker 1: Yeah.

357
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:52,999
Speaker 1: The thing I got to say about this is that you think, oh, I don't need an iPad.

358
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,168
Speaker 1: I already have an iPhone.

359
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,057
Speaker 1: I already have whatever.

360
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:55,259
Speaker 1: Right.

361
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:56,769
Speaker 1: That may be true.

362
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:57,699
Speaker 1: That may be true.

363
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:08,080
Speaker 1: But the best the thing that this is really the best at that I didn't realize it would be the best at is if you are someone like me who has a two room abode.

364
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:08,644
Speaker 1: Right.

365
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:10,519
Speaker 1: A bedroom and a living room.

366
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,899
Speaker 1: And you only have one television in the living room.

367
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,160
Speaker 1: The iPad is basically the perfect bedroom television.

368
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,700
Speaker 1: You do not need to buy a bedroom television.

369
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:21,325
Speaker 1: Right.

370
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,137
Speaker 1: You can just use this.

371
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:29,751
Speaker 1: And there are basically so many goddamn apps between Crunchyroll, Twitch, YouTube, Amazon Video, Netflix.

372
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:30,779
Speaker 1: I stopped paying for that, though.

373
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:31,990
Speaker 0: Really?

374
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:32,579
Speaker 1: Yeah.

375
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,140
Speaker 1: I have a U-verse app, which is my parents have U-verse cable.

376
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:37,883
Speaker 1: Right.

377
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,760
Speaker 1: So I have their log in so I can use the U-verse app.

378
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:49,440
Speaker 1: So I can watch anything they've recorded on the DVR, anything that's on their on demand and a bunch of live channels just on the iPad, even if I'm not in their house.

379
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,468
Speaker 1: And if I am in their house, I can like program their DVR or remote control their TV with it and shit.

380
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:55,680
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,040
Speaker 0: They really shouldn't have given you that password, should they have?

382
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:03,100
Speaker 1: I can also use it to like watch like the Red Zone and all kinds of crazy stuff.

383
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,219
Speaker 1: So that's pretty great.

384
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:08,200
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's like it's like a bedroom television.

385
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:13,840
Speaker 1: The only thing now is that I may or may not see it.

386
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,220
Speaker 1: There's a Kindle app, right?

387
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:17,861
Speaker 1: Right.

388
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,900
Speaker 1: So it's like, oh, there's a Kindle app for iPad.

389
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,960
Speaker 1: Do I really need a Kindle?

390
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,359
Speaker 0: My answer is yes.

391
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,300
Speaker 0: For one, the Kindle battery lasts for like months, as far as I can tell.

392
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:30,122
Speaker 1: That's true.

393
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,710
Speaker 0: Two, the Kindle is just.

394
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:43,020
Speaker 0: it's so light and small and one handed and simple that I and the way the screen is, the fact that the screen is a sort of a different kind of screen, the non backlit screen is a big difference.

395
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Speaker 0: So I would keep my Kindle separate even if I had an iPad retina.

396
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:47,622
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:51,992
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's like, yeah, that is those are slight reasons, but they're not humongous reasons.

398
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:52,560
Speaker 1: Right.

399
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,019
Speaker 1: And it's like the battery in this already lasts a hell of a long time.

400
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:59,720
Speaker 1: And the text does look better if, you know, the backlight isn't bothering you.

401
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,242
Speaker 1: And right.

402
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:05,199
Speaker 1: It's the only thing, though, is that you the only books are going to.

403
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,239
Speaker 1: you can't drag books onto this.

404
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,381
Speaker 1: Right.

405
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:10,960
Speaker 1: The way you can drag books onto your Kindle like it's.

406
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,239
Speaker 0: So you only get the books that are in the app.

407
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,001
Speaker 1: Yeah.

408
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:19,684
Speaker 0: And not if you email something to yourself with that special email address, I think it'll show up for both.

409
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:23,726
Speaker 1: Maybe, but it's really hard to get pirated books onto the Kindle.

410
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:25,380
Speaker 0: Oh, I see what's going on here.

411
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:26,543
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,620
Speaker 1: The pirated books aren't going to get on here that easily.

413
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:34,504
Speaker 0: So, you know, are you sure there isn't just like a directory you can stick stuff in for the app?

414
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:39,160
Speaker 1: Like, you know, search iPads are not hard drives, remember?

415
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm wondering there's got.

416
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:43,808
Speaker 0: I'm wondering if there's someone who's already solved this problem.

417
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,259
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know.

418
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,944
Speaker 0: Pirates.

419
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,200
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's possible book, but it's just not worth the effort.

420
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,420
Speaker 0: Retina text juggling e-book uses Dara to track pirates.

421
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:57,478
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, OK.

422
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:10,799
Speaker 1: Anyway, the only other thing I got to say is that Super Hexagon is way easier on an iPad, but all my skills are gone, so it's super hexagon was easier for me once.

423
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,900
Speaker 0: I just got my Nexus 4 because the processors faster.

424
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,819
Speaker 1: The processor on this is crazy fast for, you know, such a small device for them.

425
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,740
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

426
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:29,440
Speaker 0: So a new Sony console came out.

427
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:43,060
Speaker 0: If you guys didn't notice the PS4, I maybe it says something about me and the kind of gamer I am lately, but I didn't notice that it came out until I saw Dave Riley tweeting something about how he was going to go try to get a PS4 on Amazon.

428
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,629
Speaker 0: I was like, what?

429
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,219
Speaker 0: That came out.

430
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually selling really well.

431
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:48,919
Speaker 1: But I'm surprised because as far as I know, there aren't really any games.

432
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,942
Speaker 0: Well, I think someone asked me, like, hey, if I got a PS4, what's the best game to buy for it?

433
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:57,260
Speaker 0: I think my response was same as the Xbox one Netflix.

434
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:13,380
Speaker 0: So this is a video, a news event, a news segment, I guess, from 1991 when another big company released their big console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

435
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:21,819
Speaker 0: And this video is parents primarily complaining, how come Nintendo has got to release another one of these things?

436
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,460
Speaker 0: It's just going to cost us money and our kids got to stop playing these fucking video games, except for that giant study that just came out that said, yeah, yeah, great.

437
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,740
Speaker 0: No, they weren't saying it would make them violent or anything.

438
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,403
Speaker 0: They were just like.

439
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:36,059
Speaker 0: part of their complaint was the SNES cost twice as much as the NES.

440
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:36,687
Speaker 0: for what?

441
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:37,458
Speaker 0: Some better pictures.

442
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:43,520
Speaker 0: This watch this video on people who are old people now.

443
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:45,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, think of it this way.

444
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:57,343
Speaker 0: The people who are there are a lot of kids for whom the PS4 is going to be their first console, their first console, where Final Fantasy 14 is the first Final Fantasy they'll have ever heard of.

445
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:01,926
Speaker 0: They won't even believe their friend who says, yo, dog, I played Final Fantasy two.

446
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:03,318
Speaker 1: That is right.

447
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:10,660
Speaker 1: It's like if you think about it, you know, when you're into something, it's like the beginning, you know, it's like movies, TV, whatever.

448
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,142
Speaker 1: Right.

449
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:12,428
Speaker 1: It's like you don't see.

450
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:14,055
Speaker 1: kids were like Harry Potter.

451
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,175
Speaker 1: six is the first Harry Potter and they never saw Harry Potter one.

452
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, that doesn't happen.

453
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:18,120
Speaker 1: Right.

454
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:22,260
Speaker 0: But I guess today I've never played Zelda one.

455
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:22,861
Speaker 1: Right.

456
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:30,559
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you know, for Zelda, it was like Zelda 64 or even later Wind Waker, even later, you know, Minish Cat.

457
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,082
Speaker 0: Yeah.

458
00:23:31,182 --> 00:23:33,700
Speaker 1: And it's like never played the old Zelda.

459
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,004
Speaker 1: You know, I feel like there's a show that really only happens in video games more than other media.

460
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:44,397
Speaker 0: It's not like Great Gatsby 2.0 comes out and like the new movie and everyone's like, no one reads the book.

461
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:44,761
Speaker 1: Yeah.

462
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:51,139
Speaker 1: Other media's don't have those long keep more keep coming things like that, you know, or when they do.

463
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,660
Speaker 0: It's a long running TV show like you have that.

464
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:53,962
Speaker 1: Right.

465
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,860
Speaker 1: Some kid read starts reading Spider-Man today.

466
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,327
Speaker 1: He never read.

467
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:56,958
Speaker 0: What about Dr.

468
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:57,039
Speaker 0: Who?

469
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,489
Speaker 0: Most people who watch new Dr.

470
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,678
Speaker 0: Who never watched old Dr.

471
00:23:59,739 --> 00:23:59,860
Speaker 0: Who.

472
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they've seen all the new Dr.

473
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:01,358
Speaker 1: Who.

474
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,518
Speaker 1: They just haven't seen the old one.

475
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:03,122
Speaker 0: True.

476
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:06,100
Speaker 0: But I think there's a there's a differentiation.

477
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,278
Speaker 0: This is a Tuesday show idea coming or maybe a Tuesday panel, a gaming panel.

478
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,860
Speaker 1: So it's Simpson Simpsons.

479
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,900
Speaker 1: People saw some recent seasons of Simpsons.

480
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:20,900
Speaker 0: Some game sequels are a new and different game like Mario one and Mario two are different enough to where they're both completely valid.

481
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:28,540
Speaker 0: Well, if you're an American that are worth playing and don't find Mario one and Doki Doki Panic, they're worth playing on their own independently of one another.

482
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:39,683
Speaker 0: But then there are games like Call of Duty and a center Counter-Strike even where if you start playing today, you'd might as well just play the newest one and not bother with the old one.

483
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:40,209
Speaker 1: Well, they're not.

484
00:24:40,249 --> 00:24:41,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like single player.

485
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:47,446
Speaker 0: Whatever it is, the difference between the replacement sequel and the here's a different game sequel.

486
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,157
Speaker 1: I think my kids do start playing Magic today.

487
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:56,222
Speaker 0: Right, except they have the lore about the old cards and they're all obsessed with Black Lotuses.

488
00:24:56,242 --> 00:25:02,899
Speaker 0: But it's funny, like these kids, I see kids in like Netrunner and everything who will use the word tutor and they know what that means.

489
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,680
Speaker 0: But I doubt any of them have ever actually seen a demonic tutor.

490
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,802
Speaker 1: Everybody who is in the Netrunner scene in New York is someone who used to play Magic or you.

491
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:13,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that's New York.

492
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:19,140
Speaker 1: I mean, like in the in the net runner scene is all people who know what gaming is like.

493
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,605
Speaker 1: It's 10.

494
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,298
Speaker 1: It's like PAX.

495
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,780
Speaker 1: It's older people, right?

496
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,640
Speaker 1: You know, I don't see a lot of young people playing.

497
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:29,382
Speaker 0: Well, it's like people said that my 20s, 30s, my experiences with Ingress were different from theirs.

498
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:35,719
Speaker 0: And I realize that's probably, again, because New York, there's like 200 portals within a short walk of any point that I'm at.

499
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:41,500
Speaker 0: It's not like out in the middle of Bumblefuck where there's literally one portal at like the interstate turnover.

500
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:44,420
Speaker 1: Anyway, so thing of the day.

501
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:45,784
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:25:45,804 --> 00:25:46,507
Speaker 1: So you know how.

503
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:50,819
Speaker 1: the bottom of the periodic table, there's all those elements and we know that they're made in the lab.

504
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,755
Speaker 1: You can't just find a way.

505
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,561
Speaker 1: Do you mean?

506
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:58,880
Speaker 0: do you mean the bottom, like the highest numbers or the series that's at the bottom because it's split out so the table fits on a piece of paper?

507
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,482
Speaker 1: Both of them.

508
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:03,604
Speaker 1: You got like the Einsteinium and then you've got the Unilenium and all that kind of stuff.

509
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:06,700
Speaker 0: I assume you're talking about the heavy ones, not the ones in the middle.

510
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:12,277
Speaker 1: I'm talking about all of them, all of the elements that have to be made by people.

511
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:15,099
Speaker 1: And you don't just find them lying around in the ground.

512
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,340
Speaker 1: OK, but pretty much anything heavier than uranium.

513
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,324
Speaker 1: OK, OK.

514
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:25,244
Speaker 1: So, you know, we know that they're made in a lab, but it's like, well, how how did the hell do they do that?

515
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:30,699
Speaker 0: By bouncing different sized atoms and molecules against each other to try to get them to stick.

516
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,322
Speaker 1: Well, here's here's an awesome YouTube video that shows you exactly how the hell they did that.

517
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:55,605
Speaker 1: So basically at Berkeley Lab, back in the day when they discovered Mendelevium, right, they discovered Mendelevium and then they created a video that reenacted the discovery of Mendelevium with the actual scientists who did the work and the actual labs where they did it.

518
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,019
Speaker 1: So it's like they did it.

519
00:26:57,441 --> 00:27:01,499
Speaker 1: And then they made a video where they pretended to do it again and to show you exactly how it was done.

520
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,242
Speaker 0: Not bad.

521
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:12,943
Speaker 1: And the best part spoiler is they're in like the physics lab where they're where they're basically showering this thing with alpha particles to create the Mendelevium.

522
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:18,840
Speaker 1: And then they got to bring it up to the chemistry lab to do some fancy chromatography to to prove the Mendelevium is in there.

523
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,100
Speaker 0: You know, that was a moment I had in physics, like when I was taking AP physics in high school, we got into quantum stuff and we were learning about, you know, annihilation.

524
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:29,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, positron, antipos, you know, that kind of stuff.

525
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:33,359
Speaker 0: And we, you know, that graph of the two spirals that they always show.

526
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:44,103
Speaker 0: So we were looking at that image and then our professor, our teacher says, yeah, that image is literally how they figured it out by measuring the curves with rulers on that picture.

527
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:52,799
Speaker 0: And then you look at a complex one of those pictures and realize that all these things they're deriving are from very low res, fuzzy looking pictures.

528
00:27:53,781 --> 00:28:01,760
Speaker 1: But anyway, they try they bring this sample basically from one lab to the other, literally in a turbo Volkswagen Beetle.

529
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:05,359
Speaker 1: And it's like they're going because it's going to decay really fast to get it there.

530
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:06,642
Speaker 1: Right.

531
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:15,986
Speaker 1: And they actually, you know, the the exact car they use of the exact people, they drive it uphill like zipping around campus, trying to get the sample of the lab as quickly as possible.

532
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:17,640
Speaker 1: Pretty cool stuff.

533
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,102
Speaker 0: Yeah.

534
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,483
Speaker 0: Now, if they'd only settle the name of Illyrium 115.

535
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,314
Speaker 1: That's what I would name it.

536
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,860
Speaker 0: So, yeah, live streaming because we're kind of streaming this episode in a moment.

537
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:29,664
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

538
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:30,520
Speaker 0: I guess we got the metamoment.

539
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,279
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I just got a bunch of live streams up.

540
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,982
Speaker 0: Rim is obsessed with streaming things live because you have done way more live streams than I have.

541
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:42,660
Speaker 1: exhibitionist Rim just wants people to have eyeballs on him.

542
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,943
Speaker 0: Oh, you want me to go to a YouTube playlist and you don't see anyone looking at me, the person.

543
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:50,340
Speaker 0: Let's see how many live streams Rim has done.

544
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:52,579
Speaker 1: I'm showing off things and I've shown off myself.

545
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,579
Speaker 1: Rim is, Rim is arrogant and trying to show himself off.

546
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:57,345
Speaker 0: All right.

547
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:58,719
Speaker 0: Camera's pointed at you now, not me.

548
00:28:59,281 --> 00:28:59,623
Speaker 1: Great.

549
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:02,020
Speaker 1: I don't want it to be pointed at me because it's a bad day.

550
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,199
Speaker 0: All the way zoomed in.

551
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,560
Speaker 0: I'm sad for my shoulder shoulder on the way here.

552
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:07,539
Speaker 1: I'm sad for my English muffin still.

553
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:09,525
Speaker 1: I'm in mourning.

554
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:12,120
Speaker 0: You had to write a Marceline style song about the English muffin.

555
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:13,508
Speaker 0: English muffin.

556
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,120
Speaker 1: Why are you so wet?

557
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,200
Speaker 0: You know, that's the worst when you drop a food that you really wanted to eat and there's that moment when you consider eating it anyway.

558
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:24,040
Speaker 1: At least I hadn't toasted it yet.

559
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,539
Speaker 1: It was going to the toaster.

560
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,039
Speaker 0: So like I remember I but I had an English muffin that had I dropped it, like imagine if it already had like the cream cheese on it.

561
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:38,340
Speaker 0: Had I dropped the English muffin pre buttering, I might have just kind of blown it off and eaten it, but I'd put the butter on and it fell face down.

562
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,800
Speaker 0: I picked it up and there was kitchen floor on that butter.

563
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,800
Speaker 1: There was all kinds of sink water all over the muffin.

564
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,740
Speaker 1: I thought it maybe was just on like a corner of it.

565
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,859
Speaker 1: I could have cut that corner off.

566
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:55,260
Speaker 0: The worst thing is when you've got some clean dishes and you knock one of them into the sink and you're like, ah, man, so I wash that shit again.

567
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:57,380
Speaker 1: I was putting a dishwasher tab in the dishwasher.

568
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,201
Speaker 1: Right.

569
00:29:58,623 --> 00:29:59,186
Speaker 1: And it was.

570
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:01,760
Speaker 1: it was like it was a weird dishwasher tab.

571
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,546
Speaker 1: It was malformed.

572
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,080
Speaker 1: So it's kind of big and oddly shaped.

573
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,680
Speaker 0: I had one of those break open like on my hand.

574
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,447
Speaker 0: Had this moment of.

575
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,819
Speaker 0: I hope this doesn't start burning.

576
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:13,880
Speaker 0: Mine are the solid ones are minor like powder and stuff in a bag.

577
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to use that kind.

578
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:16,700
Speaker 1: Now I use the rock kind.

579
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:18,220
Speaker 1: I have a huge tiny way.

580
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:20,740
Speaker 1: I was putting it in there and this one was weird malformed.

581
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,179
Speaker 1: So I had to start to cram it in there.

582
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:22,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

583
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:26,701
Speaker 1: But then when it actually washed the dishes, it didn't pop out because it was crammed in there.

584
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:32,743
Speaker 1: So it's like now I have to go like chisel it out of there because it cleaned the dishes.

585
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:33,648
Speaker 1: But I don't know if it.

586
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,267
Speaker 1: if, you know, it's like not even half of it was disintegrated.

587
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,299
Speaker 1: I don't know if it worked.

588
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:41,139
Speaker 0: All right, Scott, of the live streams we have done, let's see.

589
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:50,060
Speaker 0: Gemfire with Rim, Solar Jetman with Rim, Megaman 2 with Scott, Legend of Zelda with Scott, more Legend of Zelda with Scott.

590
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,220
Speaker 1: How many how many am I in personally seeing my face?

591
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,299
Speaker 0: None of our faces are in any of these.

592
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,840
Speaker 1: I'm talking about this right now.

593
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,858
Speaker 1: This is your idea.

594
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,900
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a bunch of listeners watching this live.

595
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,819
Speaker 0: I can see them commenting.

596
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,058
Speaker 0: And yeah, they're really sad.

597
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,059
Speaker 0: Mostly I did it to prove a point about streaming because.

598
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,677
Speaker 1: No, you did it because you were all excited, like, oh, man, people are going to look at me just like people looking at you.

599
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:17,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

600
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:21,142
Speaker 0: Well, I'm saying I do like people looking at me, but that the end case closed.

601
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:21,564
Speaker 0: I'm not.

602
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:22,470
Speaker 0: I'm not going to deny that.

603
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:27,299
Speaker 0: the whole reason I started Geek Nights is that I wanted to have fans after I left RIT anymore.

604
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,201
Speaker 1: Yeah.

605
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:29,860
Speaker 0: News at eleven fans.

606
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,879
Speaker 1: I'm not doing it for you.

607
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,100
Speaker 1: Rim is and Rim's not doing it for you either.

608
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,459
Speaker 1: He's doing it because he wants you to eat for him.

609
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:36,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm doing it for me.

610
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,507
Speaker 1: That's right.

611
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:38,258
Speaker 0: That's how I roll.

612
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:44,420
Speaker 1: But the reason I'm doing it for the world is partly because the world needs geek nights.

613
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,278
Speaker 1: The geek nights it deserves.

614
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:57,820
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I feel like streaming video games and live streams of things are beginning still to do the metamoment really stupidly popular late.

615
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:01,500
Speaker 0: The book club book is I don't know by William Gibson.

616
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:01,963
Speaker 0: Yep.

617
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,639
Speaker 0: We've got a bunch of live streams that you can watch.

618
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,910
Speaker 1: Go to Magfest.

619
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:06,980
Speaker 0: We're going to be at Magfest.

620
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,863
Speaker 0: We're probably going to be doing a 90 minute version of the bad games panel that we did a pack.

621
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:15,099
Speaker 0: So I got to buy a couple more copies of E.T.

622
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,180
Speaker 0: to throw into the audience.

623
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,490
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can get some.

624
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:19,559
Speaker 0: I've got three.

625
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,858
Speaker 1: I'm sure on eBay we can find a lot of them.

626
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,785
Speaker 1: I actually what I kind of want to get a space, not a lot as in many, but a lot like a lot of 10.

627
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:31,679
Speaker 0: I'm confident that I could probably get enough cartridges of E.T.

628
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,340
Speaker 0: without spending much money to give to everyone who shows up to the panel.

629
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,939
Speaker 0: I don't think I'll do that because it's a pain in the ass, but I probably could.

630
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:40,822
Speaker 0: Yeah.

631
00:32:40,863 --> 00:32:41,899
Speaker 0: Pax East is sold out.

632
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,539
Speaker 0: So if you didn't get badges, that really sucks.

633
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,302
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

634
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:53,140
Speaker 0: I can't say fuck you, because unlike ancient past when we told people to buy badges and then after the badges sold out, we asked you, why did you buy?

635
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, the badges sold out like immediately.

636
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,493
Speaker 0: There's really nothing you could have done.

637
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:57,080
Speaker 0: It's just random.

638
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:00,020
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

639
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,598
Speaker 0: Geek Nights might be on again, off again during the holidays, but it'll pick up with gusto shortly after Magfest and the New Year.

640
00:33:09,803 --> 00:33:10,652
Speaker 1: Because it's Geek Nights.

641
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:11,340
Speaker 1: It's Geek Nights.

642
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,364
Speaker 0: Never stop.

643
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,759
Speaker 0: And yeah, that enough metamoment for you?

644
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:16,569
Speaker 1: It's OK enough.

645
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:17,500
Speaker 0: You want to do some more?

646
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,719
Speaker 0: You want to talk about our awesome forum?

647
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:20,839
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about that enough.

648
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,402
Speaker 1: All right.

649
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:24,820
Speaker 0: So, yeah, live streams are getting really popular lately.

650
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:36,281
Speaker 0: I mean, the fact that a consumer product like the Elgato exists at the relatively low price point that it does says a lot about how popular live streaming stuff is getting right now.

651
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:43,000
Speaker 0: So I don't want to talk about the like gaming ramifications or anything of it.

652
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:52,200
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about the technology, how and why and what not not what you're not the societal reasons about like why people want to stream stuff.

653
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,289
Speaker 0: Who's going to watch it?

654
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,360
Speaker 0: How to make a good stream?

655
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,413
Speaker 0: No, we're talking about RTMP and bandwidth.

656
00:33:58,979 --> 00:33:59,220
Speaker 0: bandwidth.

657
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,960
Speaker 0: I think is Scott's primary limiting factor in doing good streams.

658
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:02,762
Speaker 1: Yeah.

659
00:34:03,003 --> 00:34:05,960
Speaker 1: Here's the thing is that this streaming is becoming much more popular.

660
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:06,582
Speaker 1: Right.

661
00:34:07,203 --> 00:34:14,911
Speaker 1: But so many of people's Internet connections are like tons of downstream with no upstream.

662
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:15,540
Speaker 1: Right.

663
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:22,759
Speaker 1: Even Google, Google Fiber, which is fast in all the directions, had in like the user agreement, like no running servers.

664
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:26,500
Speaker 1: And that now they changed it to be like, OK, you can't basically run a business.

665
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:27,302
Speaker 1: Right.

666
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:35,250
Speaker 1: And what all they really want to do is keep is make you get hosting if you're going to run like, you know, a big Web site, because that's not what they expect you to use it for.

667
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:35,699
Speaker 1: Right.

668
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,078
Speaker 0: But like I might.

669
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,741
Speaker 1: Right.

670
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:44,295
Speaker 1: It's like but I still want to be able to upload, say, videos to YouTube or, you know, I don't know.

671
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:45,322
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:49,040
Speaker 0: Well, I think the issue is just that you have what, Time Warner?

673
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:50,386
Speaker 1: Yeah.

674
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:51,719
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that you're fine.

675
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Speaker 0: There's nothing that's like when you got Optus in Australia.

676
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:05,327
Speaker 0: So I have files, I have a lot of bandwidth and already you saw there's that article a while ago, like weeks ago, talking about something like more than half of the bandwidth consumed in the U.S.

677
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:06,859
Speaker 0: is just streaming video.

678
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:08,427
Speaker 1: That's yeah.

679
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,160
Speaker 1: But that includes like Netflix.

680
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:10,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

681
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:12,620
Speaker 0: But I'm saying that's consumer side.

682
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:14,019
Speaker 0: That's just the people watching.

683
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:24,180
Speaker 0: So if everyone's watching video, then we've got this asymmetric load where there's tons of downstream bandwidth that everyone needs to stream their HD video all the time.

684
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:29,660
Speaker 0: But if everyone's streaming stuff live up, then there's two more things that matter.

685
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,500
Speaker 0: You need upstream bandwidth, like Scott said.

686
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,599
Speaker 0: You need reliable bandwidth, which is kind of the same thing.

687
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:41,780
Speaker 0: And you also need the ability to encode that video live on the fly.

688
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,259
Speaker 0: Like when we do a lecture for Geek Nights, like those videos we upload from Apex, they're an hour long lecture, right?

689
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:55,223
Speaker 0: It takes my relatively powerful computer 12 to 20 hours to encode that video to then upload.

690
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:59,480
Speaker 0: It then takes it like two hours to upload and then it's on YouTube.

691
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:08,360
Speaker 0: So a lot of people are going to want to start streaming and not really realize that there's some severe limitations they're going to run into.

692
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:11,500
Speaker 0: And there's not a lot of help technologically to get you going.

693
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:28,320
Speaker 1: Well, the softwares that are available to consumers do a pretty good job of seeing how fast your computer is and seeing how fast your Internet is and adjusting the quality basically down until the stream is, you know, smooth, as smooth as it's going to be considering your CPU and your Internet connection.

694
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:28,641
Speaker 0: Yep.

695
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:43,056
Speaker 1: But the thing is, a lot of people will turn on streaming and it's like they'll be playing, I don't know, a PS4 with the Twitch built in stuff or who knows what or their PC with, you know, the some kind of X split or what's that?

696
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:43,979
Speaker 1: other thing people love?

697
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,400
Speaker 0: Flash Media Live.

698
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:49,820
Speaker 1: No, no, the I forget what it's called.

699
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,991
Speaker 1: Open broadcast.

700
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:51,960
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, whatever.

701
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,860
Speaker 0: Well, I remember I had the Ustream thingy that I used at one point.

702
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:55,324
Speaker 1: Yeah.

703
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:56,939
Speaker 1: And they'll be using that.

704
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:07,600
Speaker 1: And the thing is, when they actually go to look at Twitch, it's like, oh, my screen is like 1080p and super awesome looking with full frames because I have a great video card.

705
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:11,440
Speaker 1: How come when I actually go and look at Twitch, it's all pixely and shitty?

706
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,820
Speaker 0: Or never mind the fact that a lot of people will try to capture video from their gaming PC with like flaps or something.

707
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,480
Speaker 0: Forget even streaming and simultaneously try to play the game on the same device.

708
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,259
Speaker 1: And then, yeah, my computer, which is too expensive, does that.

709
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:30,560
Speaker 1: But my old computer, if I tried to flaps, the frame rate on the game would go.

710
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,960
Speaker 0: Or even then, some people say you have the external device and you're doing the encoding in like an Elgato and it's all external.

711
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,179
Speaker 0: But then you plug that USB into your laptop and it's sharing the same network connection as your counter strike and your ping starts going up.

712
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,140
Speaker 0: You need a lot of bandwidth to upload video.

713
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,741
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm uploading right now the stream live, which is 720p and not really great quality.

714
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:58,500
Speaker 0: I'm uploading at four megabits per second, four megabits per second.

715
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:00,120
Speaker 0: That's actually a lot of bandwidth.

716
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:01,266
Speaker 1: It is quite a bit.

717
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:03,439
Speaker 0: And that's actually a heavily compressed video, too.

718
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, my my whole Internet connection at home.

719
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,600
Speaker 1: I only have two up theoretically on paper.

720
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,980
Speaker 1: So I usually set the stream to like one point eight and I'll only stream like a single player game, not an Internet game that way.

721
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,960
Speaker 1: And I turn out all the other Internet's off in the house.

722
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,459
Speaker 1: So the stream basically gets to use all the upstream and leaving only like that point to just for whatever, you know, margin of error.

723
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:25,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

724
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,874
Speaker 1: And that doesn't that doesn't get me to 1080p right.

725
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,312
Speaker 1: The quality is going to be like 480p or 720p at best.

726
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:37,720
Speaker 0: Even worse, a lot of people just don't understand how compression works.

727
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,875
Speaker 0: So they'll set their streaming thing to say, yeah, 1080p.

728
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:42,060
Speaker 0: But then they have low bandwidth.

729
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:47,101
Speaker 0: So they're uploading at a bandwidth that would really only be suitable for 480i, let's say.

730
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:47,442
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:55,800
Speaker 0: So as a result, it sends 1080 pixels so heavily compressed that it looks way worse than if they just set it to 480 in the first place.

732
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,800
Speaker 1: I feel like the software should just not even give you the option if you're not a pro.

733
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:00,385
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,139
Speaker 1: And just do things the right way.

735
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,144
Speaker 0: Let's get into this.

736
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:23,400
Speaker 0: The technology one, assuming you have no specialized hardware, you need software that's going to basically read your frame buffer, like read the video that's being displayed, compress it using something like H.264, and then upload the stream of the audio and video live at a consistent rate to another location.

737
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,279
Speaker 0: And separately, if you want a copy of it locally, also write it to the disk.

738
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:31,639
Speaker 0: like the stream right now is not being written to any hard drive in our house.

739
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:33,578
Speaker 0: I'm just streaming it.

740
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,520
Speaker 1: So if YouTube fucks up, it's gone forever.

741
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gone forever.

742
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,039
Speaker 1: Except for the audio part.

743
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:41,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, the audio part is being saved in like four locations.

744
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

745
00:39:43,345 --> 00:39:43,525
Speaker 0: So

746
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:57,519
Speaker 1: the consistent part is the really hard part with home Internet connections, because like, yeah, theoretically I have two megabits per second, but it's like, you know, you're watching Netflix and sometimes even the downstream, it'll be like, oh, pixely for a second, oh, laggy for a second and we're back to HD.

747
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,110
Speaker 1: The upstream is even worse.

748
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,460
Speaker 1: if you lose a little bit of upstream.

749
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:06,920
Speaker 0: Suddenly it's like, so thus a lot of you kids will be streaming something, right?

750
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,382
Speaker 1: You're still.

751
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:12,460
Speaker 1: the computer is like still CPU encoding, like the same quality, the same bit rate, the same everything.

752
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:15,880
Speaker 1: So the network hiccups, it's sort of like a big traffic jam.

753
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,668
Speaker 1: And it goes, oh, shit.

754
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:17,599
Speaker 1: And it fucks everything up.

755
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:22,800
Speaker 0: So a lot of you kids will complain that you're looking you're trying to play your game through the thing you're streaming with.

756
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:27,060
Speaker 0: And then the stream that you see is delayed by several seconds.

757
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,799
Speaker 0: That's because you got to buffer that shit, son.

758
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:43,787
Speaker 0: Now, the other trouble is that a lot of the consumer oriented software designed to do this stuff doesn't let you twiddle all the bits that you might need to twiddle to do it all right, because

759
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:49,519
Speaker 1: if you're if you're not a tech person, you're not going to know what bits to twiddle anyway, so maybe less is better.

760
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:54,465
Speaker 0: But then, like even with external hardware, like the Elgato is a device that's designed for morons.

761
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,240
Speaker 0: It has HDMI in and HDMI out.

762
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,980
Speaker 0: So HDMI comes out of my ex-boss into this thing, out of this thing to the TV.

763
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:05,840
Speaker 0: So it just sits in the stream, reads the raw video.

764
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,140
Speaker 1: It does the encoding.

765
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,360
Speaker 1: So it doesn't matter if your CPU sucks because it does the encoding part.

766
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:13,871
Speaker 0: And then it sends the encoded data over USB to a computer.

767
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:18,319
Speaker 0: that then sends it on to YouTube or whatever and has an interface where you tell it.

768
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:28,520
Speaker 1: I don't know why they didn't just make an Elgato that was HDMI in and out and then power and a ethernet cable.

769
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,459
Speaker 1: So it just, you know, streams itself.

770
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,245
Speaker 1: Why do you?

771
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:32,459
Speaker 0: Because that would have been more complex.

772
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,300
Speaker 0: The software does a lot of the work with this thing, actually.

773
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what you could do is you could.

774
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:42,939
Speaker 1: just for if you plug the Elgato into your networks, it streams directly to wherever it's going to stream to.

775
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:43,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:50,200
Speaker 1: And when you want to connect to the Elgato to control it, it's running a web server and you visit its website like one nine two one six eight one dot whatever.

777
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,445
Speaker 0: Scott, how many people do you know that can't find their own router on their own network to configure it?

778
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:58,504
Speaker 1: There would be a software that came with the Elgato that you would double click on.

779
00:41:58,524 --> 00:42:01,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the readiness software that I've watched people fail to use.

780
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:10,160
Speaker 1: You double click it when you put in a disk or whatever or go to the website, you double click on it and it would pretty much just send your web browser to the Elgato.

781
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,380
Speaker 0: And here's the real answer, in my opinion, because this is not prosumer.

782
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:20,080
Speaker 0: It is consumer consumer level media equipment or just consumer level.

783
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,542
Speaker 0: Anything.

784
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:31,161
Speaker 0: the difference between consumer and prosumer is that a consumer level thing will not do anything that is useful for an expert if it costs any amount of money to do.

785
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:37,740
Speaker 0: Having an ethernet and having to configure all that and have that in the device would make the unit marginally more expensive.

786
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,440
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, doing all of that in software, relying on the fact that the software is running on a general purpose computer is cheaper.

787
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:52,100
Speaker 0: Some developer in India or whatever is way cheaper than a hardware guy, I guess, and way cheaper than the incremental cost of manufacturing.

788
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:59,419
Speaker 0: Also, for the kinds of people who are using this device, they would not not buy it if that feature wasn't there.

789
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,239
Speaker 0: I mean, we both bought it.

790
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:05,380
Speaker 0: The problem is that a lot of the software like the Elgato is a great example.

791
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:18,880
Speaker 0: You tell it like, oh, I want to stream to YouTube and you type in your credentials and it just works, meaning if you start streaming, it immediately starts sending your stream to YouTube live and everyone starts seeing it immediately.

792
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:23,299
Speaker 0: But you can't like really preview it to see if it'll work.

793
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,120
Speaker 0: You can't like time the start.

794
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,399
Speaker 0: Sometimes you start streaming and watch every stream people put up.

795
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,680
Speaker 0: There's a few minutes of like, hey, is this thing working?

796
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:35,460
Speaker 0: I don't know, like poking around trying to make sure it's working before they start.

797
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,060
Speaker 0: Because these things don't give you good error messages.

798
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,760
Speaker 0: They don't give you any insight into what's actually happening.

799
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:54,059
Speaker 0: In fact, the Elgato only recently got an update that lets me do raw RTMP so I can ignore all of its bullshit and I can use the real YouTube live event interface and just say, here's the URL and the streaming key.

800
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:55,760
Speaker 0: And then I get this whole command console.

801
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,840
Speaker 0: Like right now, I can see who's looking at the stream.

802
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:02,440
Speaker 0: I can see all the streams I'm sending and if my bandwidth is good and pretty much everything.

803
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:13,818
Speaker 0: So I can actually see if the stream is going to work first and then start it when I'm ready, as opposed to losing my Gemfire stream because I didn't realize it stopped working because the Elgato didn't tell me.

804
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:22,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one thing that really bothers me is that, you know, you can make RTMP streams or you can stream with like Twitch API, like directly to the service you're using.

805
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:23,165
Speaker 1: And you're really.

806
00:44:23,185 --> 00:44:24,600
Speaker 1: why would you want to use it these days?

807
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,740
Speaker 1: I think you stream and such are pretty much dead.

808
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:29,399
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just Twitter, YouTube for pretty much anything you can do.

809
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:36,760
Speaker 1: But it's annoying that you can't use like a streaming device as a webcam.

810
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:39,640
Speaker 1: Like it's a webcam is different to a computer.

811
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:39,909
Speaker 1: Yeah.

812
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,140
Speaker 0: Then a streaming device is because a webcam has to be nominally real time.

813
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:45,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

814
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,880
Speaker 1: But it's like I want to be able to use Google Hangout with the Elgato.

815
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:49,380
Speaker 1: Right.

816
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:57,740
Speaker 1: So then we can, you know, or I want to be able to have like a webcam and my Elgato going to a Google Hangout so we can all webcam and see each other's faces in the hangout.

817
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,739
Speaker 1: We can also see the game I'm playing and talk about it or, you know, stuff like that.

818
00:45:02,882 --> 00:45:10,259
Speaker 1: But there's no way to do that because, you know, the on your local computer, Google Hangout is looking for a webcam using webcam API.

819
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, because normal people don't care about using anything other than that or other than a screen shot.

820
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,080
Speaker 1: If I take a real camera and plug it into the Elgato, I can't use that in Google Hangout.

821
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,547
Speaker 1: I can only.

822
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:21,220
Speaker 0: why would you bother?

823
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,480
Speaker 0: Google Hangout compresses the video so much and you have so little.

824
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,220
Speaker 1: It's not about the quality of that video.

825
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:31,200
Speaker 1: It's about the content of that video.

826
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:31,600
Speaker 1: Right.

827
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:40,500
Speaker 1: If I have, you know, I can get different, you know, my webcam is like a little USB cable and I can only move it so close to whatever computer.

828
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,480
Speaker 0: Scott, you want you want a USB cable extender?

829
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:46,160
Speaker 1: No, that's not even going to help the situation.

830
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:46,480
Speaker 1: Right.

831
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,300
Speaker 1: You're going to hold this little tiny webcam, whatever.

832
00:45:49,721 --> 00:46:00,799
Speaker 1: If I have, you know, my GoPro or some sort of, you know, real camera that, you know, is got like an HDMI cable going to the Elgato, then, you know, I can do things like, you know, I can get much better shots.

833
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:10,020
Speaker 0: And even if the quality is low, your use case is not in any way profitable to pursue because nobody can stream a video game into Google Hangout.

834
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,580
Speaker 1: You can't do that with a webcam.

835
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:12,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

836
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,480
Speaker 0: But that's because that's not what it's designed for or what anyone cares about.

837
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,640
Speaker 1: There are people who want to do that.

838
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,079
Speaker 0: Not enough people to be first for it to be profitable to set something like that up.

839
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:21,299
Speaker 1: I don't even know why.

840
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Speaker 1: Why is it different, though?

841
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,900
Speaker 1: It should just be, you know, why aren't all streaming devices just seen as WebKit?

842
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,660
Speaker 1: It's no different.

843
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:27,940
Speaker 1: Right.

844
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,578
Speaker 1: Just make everything the same API.

845
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:31,740
Speaker 1: It's streaming video into the computer.

846
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:34,008
Speaker 0: Well, because it's not it's not.

847
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,220
Speaker 0: you have that with things like Firewire, Scott.

848
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:38,619
Speaker 1: No, but that won't go to Google Hangout.

849
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:41,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you realize why is a webcam any different?

850
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,098
Speaker 1: It should all be the same.

851
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:46,480
Speaker 0: Scott, partly it's because webcams all rely upon the software that's installed.

852
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,540
Speaker 0: Life cams don't work for shit unless you install the special Microsoft life cam software.

853
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:51,383
Speaker 1: No, there's just.

854
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:54,600
Speaker 1: it's like there is in Windows and on OS X and on Linux.

855
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,740
Speaker 1: There's like, you know, this in the operating system is like a webcam API where the operating system is drivers and recognizes webcams.

856
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, a specific kind of device.

857
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,560
Speaker 0: And you have to follow that contract.

858
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,879
Speaker 0: I'm saying most people don't care.

859
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,880
Speaker 0: So there's no reason to do that.

860
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,480
Speaker 1: I think there's more people who want that than you realize.

861
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,938
Speaker 0: I'm not if there were if there's enough people that want that.

862
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,420
Speaker 1: Google Hangouts on air become pretty popular.

863
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,340
Speaker 1: They've even added some features for Google Hangouts on air to where you can like take questions and all that kind of stuff.

864
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,440
Speaker 0: And I'm saying that it only works with a webcam.

865
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:29,019
Speaker 1: So it's like if you're doing some cool Google Hangout with right, you can't use your real streaming stuff for it.

866
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,200
Speaker 0: So buy a real, real streaming device that gives you all those capabilities.

867
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:39,140
Speaker 0: It has like four HDMI ins and it's a PCI Express card and it's crazy expensive.

868
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,238
Speaker 0: Buy one of those things.

869
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,385
Speaker 1: But it's just all.

870
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:44,999
Speaker 1: they could even do with the Elgato if they would just write a stupid webcam driver for it.

871
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,580
Speaker 0: Yes, but why haven't they?

872
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,380
Speaker 0: Because no one's going to not buy it if it doesn't have that functionality.

873
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:50,138
Speaker 1: Sure, whatever.

874
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,850
Speaker 1: That's the reason I'm just saying it's it's.

875
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:53,080
Speaker 1: it's a concern, right?

876
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,620
Speaker 1: Is that different different places to stream to and from and different softwares?

877
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,920
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, look, it's the same thing with audio.

878
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:01,300
Speaker 0: It's the same thing with audio.

879
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,760
Speaker 0: If you have like I have a really good mixer and I have a lot of really good Firewire audio equipment.

880
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,057
Speaker 1: But it's all just recognized as sound.

881
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,019
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

882
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,080
Speaker 0: It is in a sense.

883
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:18,700
Speaker 0: But if you want to use Steam or something and you want to tell it, yeah, use incoming interface eight from this device B as my microphone in Counter-Strike, it won't fucking do that.

884
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:19,092
Speaker 0: Why not?

885
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:20,220
Speaker 0: Because it won't.

886
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:20,622
Speaker 0: It'll only.

887
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:24,830
Speaker 0: it'll only use the first interface it saw because no one wrote the software to handle this.

888
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:25,480
Speaker 0: because no one cares.

889
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:28,140
Speaker 1: It works for me when I try to use different inputs.

890
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,280
Speaker 0: Which inputs on which kinds of device?

891
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,180
Speaker 1: If it shows up as an input device.

892
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:35,180
Speaker 1: Yes, as an audio input device in Windows.

893
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:42,960
Speaker 1: Then you can go to the Windows Audio Center and set it as your default input device and then go to Steam and say input microphone.

894
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,279
Speaker 1: This is choose that one.

895
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:44,680
Speaker 1: Yes.

896
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,700
Speaker 0: So I set the Mackie Onyx as my input device.

897
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:50,180
Speaker 0: It has like 24 channels that it can send.

898
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,779
Speaker 1: Aren't those all seen as separate devices?

899
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,660
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

900
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,619
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a problem.

901
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:56,840
Speaker 0: That's most audio software and most audio hardware.

902
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,418
Speaker 1: It should show up if it's got it.

903
00:48:58,802 --> 00:48:59,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could show up.

904
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,519
Speaker 0: The software just doesn't support it.

905
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it should show up as like 20 sound cards.

906
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,198
Speaker 0: Case in point.

907
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,700
Speaker 0: My I have a device that's just a firewire input.

908
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,758
Speaker 0: It's just a plug.

909
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:10,020
Speaker 0: It's not a mixer.

910
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,794
Speaker 0: You just plug a bunch of devices into it and it gives you individual channels via firewire to the PC.

911
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:23,960
Speaker 0: If you tell the Ogato to use that device, it'll only ever see audio from microphone one and doesn't even see the line inputs or any of the other inputs.

912
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:31,540
Speaker 1: See, the people who wrote the software for those firewire devices should have written it as such that Windows didn't see this one magic weird device.

913
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,540
Speaker 1: Instead, it saw like 20 normal boring.

914
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,600
Speaker 0: And my point is that no one cares enough to bother because it's not worth money to do.

915
00:49:39,884 --> 00:49:40,640
Speaker 1: do it a different way.

916
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,200
Speaker 1: Do it something that makes some non standard proprietary thing.

917
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,220
Speaker 1: That's always easier.

918
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it usually is for these people.

919
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's people who make hardware always write the shittiest software.

920
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,140
Speaker 0: Dude, good hardware has shit drivers in general.

921
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,999
Speaker 0: The Mackie drivers.

922
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:54,139
Speaker 0: Not so great.

923
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,180
Speaker 0: Wake up every hardware that great.

924
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,860
Speaker 1: Every software that ever comes to the hardware is always been shit forever.

925
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:02,440
Speaker 1: And it's like all they do is make things worse.

926
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,380
Speaker 1: Why do you even write the friggin software at all?

927
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:08,040
Speaker 1: If you make hardware, don't even write drivers for it.

928
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,879
Speaker 1: Just let the default OS drivers just take care of it.

929
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,360
Speaker 1: Don't do anything.

930
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,550
Speaker 0: That's not going to work so well.

931
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:14,560
Speaker 0: for like a mixer.

932
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:19,420
Speaker 1: It could work just fine because it would show up as like it was a 20 channel mixer.

933
00:50:20,043 --> 00:50:23,320
Speaker 1: Show up as 20 completely normal generic sound cards.

934
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,100
Speaker 0: That's not how it would ever work.

935
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,399
Speaker 0: And that's not how it works now.

936
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,380
Speaker 1: You could easily make it work that way.

937
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,780
Speaker 0: They're not separate devices.

938
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,860
Speaker 0: They have a synchronized clock.

939
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,320
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why it's not that way.

940
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,320
Speaker 1: They could still be synchronized.

941
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,320
Speaker 1: They would just show up as far as Windows is concerned as 20 normal sound cards.

942
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,020
Speaker 1: That way, everything that used sound cards would work with them.

943
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,439
Speaker 0: Except, you know, it wouldn't fucking work.

944
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,080
Speaker 0: Adobe Audition needs to see the device as a unit.

945
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:48,980
Speaker 0: If it showed up as 20 devices, you could only record from one of those at a time.

946
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,127
Speaker 1: Oh, so that it would.

947
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,960
Speaker 1: just why can't you record and do things at a time?

948
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,599
Speaker 0: Because their clocks won't be synchronized.

949
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,284
Speaker 0: You can still.

950
00:50:54,325 --> 00:50:55,820
Speaker 1: it would be synchronized on the other end.

951
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,285
Speaker 1: You don't know.

952
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,260
Speaker 1: that needs to know about that.

953
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:57,998
Speaker 0: It doesn't know that.

954
00:50:58,242 --> 00:50:59,015
Speaker 1: It doesn't need to know.

955
00:50:59,466 --> 00:50:59,738
Speaker 1: You can.

956
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,519
Speaker 0: It also it depends on if you like as API or was API and all that stuff.

957
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:07,005
Speaker 1: It's that's all.

958
00:51:07,086 --> 00:51:11,360
Speaker 1: it's one of those things where we've already been dug into a hole and there's no way out anyway.

959
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:13,300
Speaker 0: At least try getting all this to work on Linux.

960
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,920
Speaker 1: So kill yourself.

961
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:17,460
Speaker 0: So, guys, the way we stream stuff now.

962
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:19,131
Speaker 1: By the way, Atari car E.T.

963
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:20,580
Speaker 1: cartridges are like a dollar on eBay.

964
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,960
Speaker 1: So I'm sure you can get a stack of them at like Magfest or something.

965
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,356
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

966
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:25,489
Speaker 0: So the way we stream stuff is.

967
00:51:25,529 --> 00:51:30,440
Speaker 0: we bought these Elgato devices like we keep mentioning because they're just a box HDMI in and out.

968
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,460
Speaker 0: I don't even use the HDMI out most of the time.

969
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:33,800
Speaker 0: I don't use it in stream.

970
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:36,440
Speaker 0: I just use it as it's like a ghetto video capture.

971
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,660
Speaker 1: I actually got a video, an HDMI splitter for my Elgato.

972
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,860
Speaker 1: So that way, for example, let's say I have my PC in a stream.

973
00:51:45,184 --> 00:51:46,360
Speaker 1: What the PC is showing.

974
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:46,980
Speaker 1: Right.

975
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:49,240
Speaker 1: But I want to stream it using that PC as well.

976
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:50,237
Speaker 1: Usually my HDPC.

977
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,058
Speaker 0: Yeah.

978
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:54,440
Speaker 1: I'll take the HDMI out from the HDPC into the Elgato.

979
00:51:55,101 --> 00:52:03,059
Speaker 1: If I take the HDMI out from the Elgato into my TV, then I won't be able to see what's on the TV unless the Elgato gets turned on.

980
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,940
Speaker 1: The only way to turn the Elgato on is to turn on the Elgato software.

981
00:52:06,262 --> 00:52:08,559
Speaker 1: But how can I turn on the Elgato software if I can't see anything?

982
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I use case for the Elgato is?

983
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:14,260
Speaker 0: I got my Xbox and I want to stream my Xbox in.

984
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:14,956
Speaker 1: Exactly.

985
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:25,680
Speaker 1: So what I do is I will just with the splitter that, you know, the output from the splitter goes to the TV so I can always see what the HDPC sees on the screen.

986
00:52:26,362 --> 00:52:29,720
Speaker 1: And there's just an output going to the Elgato to the Elgato's in.

987
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,060
Speaker 1: And I'm not using the out from the Elgato for anything at all that.

988
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:38,160
Speaker 1: And you get this cool sort of infinity effect when you open Elgato software.

989
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:44,940
Speaker 0: But so we use the Elgato just because it does the encoding and everything in a separate device where you have to worry about any hardware.

990
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, it won't slow your computer down.

991
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:51,560
Speaker 1: But, you know, your CPU in your computer is only playing the game and isn't doing any video encoding.

992
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:54,260
Speaker 1: It's only doing a little bit of TCP/IP to do the uploading.

993
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:06,540
Speaker 0: So right now I have my, the Geek Nights camera basically kind of pointed at us and the HDMI out of it, which just shows raw video pre-encode over HDMI from what the camera sees.

994
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,719
Speaker 0: It's just showing whatever the camera sees.

995
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,519
Speaker 0: In fact, if I turn the screen around, I think it'll actually show like the camera's stats and everything, like all the menus just in the stream.

996
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:22,676
Speaker 0: And that's just going into the Elgato and I'm running the software and it's streaming to a YouTube live event, which I set up to be a 720p stream.

997
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,738
Speaker 0: And I set the bandwidth and I set all this stuff and it gave me a streaming key and a streaming URL.

998
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,499
Speaker 0: And I plugged it all in and it just worked.

999
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:38,056
Speaker 0: When I stream video games or something, I just put the Elgato in line between my HTPC and the TV.

1000
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:42,437
Speaker 0: The Elgato is plugged into my laptop, which is sitting next to me with a headset plugged into it.

1001
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,640
Speaker 0: And then that's how I get my voice into the stream.

1002
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:48,259
Speaker 0: And again, I use the YouTube live event or the Twitch, whatever, and it just works.

1003
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:58,959
Speaker 0: So I wonder at what point we're going to see the prosumer level stuff, because right now with this kind of work, there's consumer and pro.

1004
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,359
Speaker 0: There's not a lot in the middle ground yet.

1005
00:54:02,502 --> 00:54:03,339
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

1006
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,700
Speaker 0: Not a lot of software, not a lot of hardware.

1007
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:18,480
Speaker 1: But as more and more people are streaming, especially on Twitch, you know, the demand for things that help you with that is only going to increase and the upstream bandwidth required by, you know, the ISPs is only going to increase.

1008
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:23,260
Speaker 1: So and I don't see the popularity going down anytime soon.

1009
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,600
Speaker 1: People freaking love to watch other people play video games, which I don't understand.

1010
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,460
Speaker 0: Like I saw a lot of people watch that stream.

1011
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:30,200
Speaker 0: I did a Gemfire.

1012
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,220
Speaker 0: And seriously, that is a tedious fucking game.

1013
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:33,779
Speaker 1: Salty bet.

1014
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:35,880
Speaker 0: But Salty Bet is not tedious.

1015
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:37,859
Speaker 0: Watch Gemfire that game.

1016
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,700
Speaker 1: I'm not watching Gemfire.

1017
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:43,000
Speaker 0: But like I went through and watched a whole bunch of like popular let's play videos.

1018
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,320
Speaker 0: They have like hundreds of thousands of views.

1019
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:46,880
Speaker 0: And I can't imagine why anyone would watch them.

1020
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,000
Speaker 1: One guy at my work, he watches like these Ocarina of Time videos a lot.

1021
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,339
Speaker 1: I guess it's because his game.

1022
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:52,820
Speaker 1: Right.

1023
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,620
Speaker 1: And it's he says it's because he doesn't have time to play games anymore.

1024
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,499
Speaker 1: So he just watches them.

1025
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,479
Speaker 1: But why did you get takes the same amount of time as playing it?

1026
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,740
Speaker 1: No, because he just like has it on while he's doing work.

1027
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,239
Speaker 1: He's like Scott Johnson driving multitasking bullshit.

1028
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,340
Speaker 0: Just experiencing what the game looks like without playing Ocarina of Time before.

1029
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:11,700
Speaker 0: So why does he need to experience that again?

1030
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,160
Speaker 1: He's minorly reliving Ocarina of Time.

1031
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,820
Speaker 1: I guess he's also watching speed runs and shit.

1032
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:18,613
Speaker 1: You know, I guess.

1033
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,154
Speaker 0: Well, so here's an example of the complexity of what.

1034
00:55:22,174 --> 00:55:26,980
Speaker 1: maybe somebody will watch the video and someone will find do something you wouldn't do and show you things you never saw.

1035
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,800
Speaker 0: So here's a complex thing that we can do with streaming.

1036
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,860
Speaker 0: We think we're going to try to set this up at Kineticon.

1037
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,477
Speaker 0: No promises.

1038
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:38,060
Speaker 0: So in one of the panel rooms, we want to take our two Elgatos, plug them into laptops.

1039
00:55:38,824 --> 00:55:40,120
Speaker 0: And have two cameras hooked up.

1040
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,300
Speaker 1: We're not going to have any Internet in there.

1041
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,500
Speaker 0: We're going to get physical drops if we do this.

1042
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,339
Speaker 1: How are we going to get them?

1043
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:45,899
Speaker 0: You can just pay the convention center for it.

1044
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,679
Speaker 1: Who's paying for it?

1045
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,519
Speaker 0: The Kineticon.

1046
00:55:48,024 --> 00:55:48,639
Speaker 1: Are they really?

1047
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,160
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1048
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,020
Speaker 1: Unlikely.

1049
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,400
Speaker 0: We're talking about it because it would be a good promotional thing.

1050
00:55:53,205 --> 00:55:53,940
Speaker 0: It's in discussions.

1051
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,298
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not that expensive to set the stuff up.

1052
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,780
Speaker 1: Why some panel room?

1053
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,020
Speaker 0: Because we're going to do it ourselves.

1054
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:00,725
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't.

1055
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,879
Speaker 0: I don't control main events, so I don't want to spend all my time working on main events.

1056
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:08,840
Speaker 1: So I'm saying as far as the con is concerned, why not?

1057
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:10,794
Speaker 0: Wouldn't the con want to stream main events?

1058
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,312
Speaker 0: You would want to stream like the you'd have.

1059
00:56:14,352 --> 00:56:18,359
Speaker 0: you need a video person to like pick the right camera angles live and stream that thing.

1060
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:20,219
Speaker 0: And there aren't as many events in there.

1061
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:23,859
Speaker 0: It's lower risk to do a streaming live thing of the panels first.

1062
00:56:24,944 --> 00:56:26,320
Speaker 0: But anyway, plus we're just doing it.

1063
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,679
Speaker 0: I mean, who's going to do it if we don't do it?

1064
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:36,840
Speaker 0: So we can set up two Elgatos with two cameras and we can actually send two streams to YouTube in a YouTube live event.

1065
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,420
Speaker 0: The YouTube live event will let viewers pick which stream they want to watch.

1066
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:41,658
Speaker 0: That's OK.

1067
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,478
Speaker 0: Like camera angle a camera angle B.

1068
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,620
Speaker 1: Can they get picture in picture?

1069
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:45,820
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1070
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,659
Speaker 0: I've never used it before.

1071
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:47,964
Speaker 0: I only know on the back end.

1072
00:56:48,586 --> 00:57:05,740
Speaker 0: if we wanted to be redundant, we could have four Elgatos, two cameras with two camera angles streaming directly to YouTube and via like a different connection, like a 4G something at a lower resolution to a backup URL on the off chance that something goes wrong along the way.

1073
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,980
Speaker 1: If your Internet goes down, your stream is still alive.

1074
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:08,540
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1075
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,380
Speaker 0: Lower res maybe.

1076
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:17,120
Speaker 0: We can use the Mackie Mixer that I can stick in the room to get the good audio from the microphones in the stream instead of either camera's audio.

1077
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,640
Speaker 0: And then we can also and this is key.

1078
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,960
Speaker 0: And whenever you're streaming stuff, you really need to think about this.

1079
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:32,040
Speaker 0: The stream workflow, the path of signals that gets to the YouTube stream is entirely independent of the archival record.

1080
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:40,820
Speaker 0: If you want to do something with video later, you need to record all the audio and video raw locally to hard drives completely independent of your stream.

1081
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,980
Speaker 0: So we would also have laptops recording everything.

1082
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,519
Speaker 0: And I'm a ranch.

1083
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,154
Speaker 1: Well, the Elgato software has a record button you can press.

1084
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:48,119
Speaker 1: that does the job.

1085
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:49,719
Speaker 0: But you got to make sure you do that.

1086
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:50,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1087
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,279
Speaker 1: Push the button and have enough hard drive space.

1088
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:56,039
Speaker 1: Usually an external one, because the one in your laptop is not going to be big enough.

1089
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,877
Speaker 0: But unless you have a shitty laptop without an SSD, then you probably got like a terabyte in there.

1090
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,980
Speaker 0: And then if you ever so then you'll have the live stream event.

1091
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:18,400
Speaker 0: And once it's done, you have to take all that video and edit it into your sort of final cut and then upload that later, much higher quality, because the stream will never be as high quality as what you could encode with a better encoder that takes longer.

1092
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,480
Speaker 1: What I want to be able to do is add graphic and I know how to add graphics to something that's recorded.

1093
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,199
Speaker 1: Just go to After Effects and put them on there.

1094
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:26,960
Speaker 1: How do you do it to the live stream?

1095
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:27,739
Speaker 1: Like which software?

1096
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,699
Speaker 1: Everyone's doing it.

1097
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:29,998
Speaker 1: But what software are they doing it with?

1098
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:32,320
Speaker 0: See, because I use the Elgato, I have no way to do that.

1099
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,260
Speaker 0: You need something in the live stream, like between the video being recorded.

1100
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,419
Speaker 1: I want to know what the hell these people are using, because I can't do that.

1101
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,720
Speaker 0: Have you done any research?

1102
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,818
Speaker 1: A little bit.

1103
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,799
Speaker 0: Do you think like explain because Ustream could do that?

1104
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,300
Speaker 1: Well, no, I don't think it's not using Ustream.

1105
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,020
Speaker 1: They're on Twitch.

1106
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:50,159
Speaker 0: I know I'm saying the software I used for Ustream could just do that.

1107
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:52,439
Speaker 0: Google Hangouts can just do that.

1108
00:58:52,780 --> 00:59:00,160
Speaker 0: I'm sure whatever software they're using has some panel where you can have PNGs with transparency that you just turn on and off, something like that.

1109
00:59:01,021 --> 00:59:03,000
Speaker 0: There's no good way to do that in YouTube.

1110
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:17,919
Speaker 0: So if I wanted to do any sort of motion graphics in my stream, I'd either need another camera angle to switch to, or I would need to have something in my HDMI workflow before it hits the Elgato, inserting that stuff.

1111
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,820
Speaker 0: The real answer is if you care and you're doing this for real, buy a TriCaster.

1112
00:59:23,346 --> 00:59:24,178
Speaker 1: If you're mad rich.

1113
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,440
Speaker 0: Kickstarter guys, buy Rim and Scott a TriCaster.

1114
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,959
Speaker 1: Sounds like a good Kickstarter to me.

1115
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,450
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1116
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:43,569
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1117
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:49,010
Speaker 1: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1118
00:59:49,272 --> 00:59:51,930
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1119
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:56,670
Speaker 0: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1121
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,530
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1122
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,630
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
