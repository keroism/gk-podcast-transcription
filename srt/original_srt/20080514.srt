26
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:43,398
Speaker 1: I had this piece of rye bread in my mouth.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,210
Speaker 1: all I could think of was school girls with toast.

28
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:48,689
Speaker 0: It's totally rain.

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:56,050
Speaker 1: We're late for school ray from the end of Ava I don't know But that's it's a. it's a classic thing that they do in a lot of those school girl late for school.

30
00:01:56,231 --> 00:02:01,999
Speaker 0: There's something about a girl a school girl running with toast in her mouth And it happens all the time.

31
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,268
Speaker 1: so in addition to that right check this out, right?

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,523
Speaker 1: I Was at my parents house like a couple weeks ago, and I brought some laundry.

33
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:10,949
Speaker 1: my mom did the laundry right?

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,919
Speaker 0: Wow I haven't had that luxury in life.

35
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,323
Speaker 1: my mom will do your laundry if you want.

36
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:20,276
Speaker 0: my mom hasn't done my laundry in like A decade.

37
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:21,650
Speaker 1: I would if I had a dryer.

38
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,126
Speaker 1: I would never give my mom even a single sock, but I don't have a dryer.

39
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,334
Speaker 1: so socks She she washed.

40
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,987
Speaker 1: let's get a drive the machine put in the machine that they the machine was.

41
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:33,875
Speaker 0: just buy a house And then buy a dryer.

42
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:36,910
Speaker 0: dishwasher put it in the house, I think dryer takes precedence.

43
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:39,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, that does, but both are.

44
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:48,830
Speaker 1: It's a close to it is anyway, so When she did this laundry she must have cleaned a pair of my father's jeans.

45
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,589
Speaker 1: Cuz when I got home that pulled a pair of jeans out of the basket, and they were much too large for me.

46
00:02:54,191 --> 00:03:03,886
Speaker 1: I was like huh alrighty, and then I went back to my parents house last weekend, and I said oh, yeah I forgot I have a pair of your jeans, and he's like oh, why didn't you bring them like I forgot?

47
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:08,730
Speaker 1: he's like well You know I'm driving out somewhere such-and-such for work in a few days.

48
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:14,570
Speaker 1: You know I'll let you know and then you could just like leave the jeans like you know in the screen door or something right?

49
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,407
Speaker 1: So you left me a voicemail last night like let me know if you're gonna leave the jeans.

50
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:22,179
Speaker 1: if you're not good I'm not gonna bother stopping over right.

51
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:25,393
Speaker 1: so our this morning with all that free time I remembered.

52
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:34,140
Speaker 1: so I called my dad, and I said yeah, I'm gonna leave the jeans there, but then I Work and I get a phone call.

53
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:37,520
Speaker 1: I like who the hell's calling me I pick it up, and he's like where the jeans.

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,314
Speaker 0: you know you know what the answer is Hobo must have stolen.

55
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:41,916
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

56
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:43,781
Speaker 1: They're in my bedroom on the floor.

57
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:46,570
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the thing is he has a key to my house.

58
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 1: He doesn't have it on him, so I was just like ah I made you Take a little tiny detour from your trip to stop at the house.

59
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:54,194
Speaker 1: I didn't leave the jeans.

60
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:57,309
Speaker 0: at least it's not that bad a detour because the one of them it like.

61
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:04,510
Speaker 0: Probably the best benefit of living in Beacon for us You know with gig nights and traveling all the time is that we know we always have this discussion.

62
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,584
Speaker 0: We always think why don't we just move to Brooklyn?

63
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,370
Speaker 0: god damn it?

64
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,313
Speaker 0: We should live in Brooklyn.

65
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:15,470
Speaker 0: Brooklyn is awesome blah blah blah, and then we always realize suddenly if you look at a map There's pretty much no way out of Brooklyn.

66
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,543
Speaker 0: The subway yeah, but now with a car?

67
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:19,808
Speaker 0: no no not really.

68
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:27,190
Speaker 0: and In Beacon we live pretty much at the junction of two of the like the biggest freeways in the area.

69
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's hard to get to 95 which is one of the most maybe the most important highway in the area.

70
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not.

71
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:36,130
Speaker 1: it's very much like we can get to all the highways except that one.

72
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:44,375
Speaker 0: It's like there's two things we can get to every highway except 95 and we can get to every city except Philadelphia.

73
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:48,250
Speaker 1: yep well cuz 95 is like the Philadelphia, Iowa, but yeah, yeah, there are some.

74
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,810
Speaker 0: I was actually I was reading about the freeway projects that are coming up.

75
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,086
Speaker 0: There's some long-term projects that'll make it a lot easier for us to get to 95.

76
00:04:55,086 --> 00:05:03,986
Speaker 1: yeah the main problem is that the shortest way to get to 95 involves going closer to New York City and the hiccups.

77
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,490
Speaker 1: Hiccup yeah the traffic involved in going near New York City makes it not worth it.

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,080
Speaker 1: So it's you're better off avoiding the city.

79
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:18,450
Speaker 1: so you avoid the city Avoid the city and you want to get to 95. that means you have to take the Garden State into Jersey then take like.

80
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,466
Speaker 1: Then we have to switch over to 95 where the Garden State 95 really close to each other.

81
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,112
Speaker 0: a little hint for any non New Yorkers.

82
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,441
Speaker 0: that's always the faster way.

83
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,654
Speaker 0: yeah unless it's four in the morning And there's no baseball game.

84
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:34,511
Speaker 1: the problem is is that puts us way south you know on 95.

85
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:39,491
Speaker 1: So it's like the place that we there are places that are north of that juncture on 95.

86
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,297
Speaker 1: We might want to get to.

87
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:52,990
Speaker 1: that become difficult to get to yeah But at the same time it actually is really really fast to get to like Otacon and Kotsukkad like oh Yeah, we're going anywhere Jersey, and you know mid Jersey and south then it's it's not a problem.

88
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:55,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course we have the problem now of all right.

89
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,203
Speaker 0: so say we want to go hang out with Scott Johnson in Wildwood some Weekend all right.

90
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:01,909
Speaker 0: well We're in New York City.

91
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:09,990
Speaker 0: So we take the train back home on Friday an hour north And then we get in a car and drive an hour south, and then we continue driving.

92
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:13,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's nowhere easy to leave a car.

93
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:21,255
Speaker 0: Nope, I mean and the thing is I'd say oh well I'll just drive into Manhattan because there's a parking garage not right next to where I work cause of a jillion dollars And it's full.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,504
Speaker 0: I could get in.

95
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,661
Speaker 0: you know early I work and most of a lot of my co-workers drive in anyway.

96
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:36,785
Speaker 0: Wow yeah, but the problem There is that my car is not doing so well now I discovered that the just actually today that the source of my problem.

97
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,230
Speaker 0: Is that my transmission?

98
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,415
Speaker 0: No, it's not so happy.

99
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:45,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'd have to take Scott's car, but Scott won't let me drive his car Destroy it.

100
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,295
Speaker 1: look at your car.

101
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:47,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, my car.

102
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:51,430
Speaker 0: That's destroyed mostly because it's oh you also crashed it like twice.

103
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:53,736
Speaker 0: Well, it was crashed into twice.

104
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:56,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I know car.

105
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:56,985
Speaker 1: have I ever driven?

106
00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:00,255
Speaker 1: has ever been crashed by me Or been crashed into?

107
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:04,754
Speaker 0: at the same time you've driven a pitiful fraction of the number of miles I've driven in my life.

108
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:07,967
Speaker 0: Uh-huh I've driven plenty's not so much plenty.

109
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,650
Speaker 0: all those weekends I'd be driving back and forth between Rochester and Detroit.

110
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:20,350
Speaker 0: That time that crazy road trip from Poughkeepsie to Lansing and then two days later from Detroit to Wildwood.

111
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,359
Speaker 1: Regardless You know if you had some fancy new car.

112
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,970
Speaker 1: I don't think you would be letting unsafe drivers drive it.

113
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:30,570
Speaker 0: I'd let you drive it in a second, and you're a pretty crappy driver all things considered.

114
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,473
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

115
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:35,765

00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:59,896
Speaker 1: of course I'm gonna tell you what it was like.

147
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:05,179
Speaker 1: so one of the things I read was This Avengers Kree's Kroll war.

148
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:08,330
Speaker 0: you might remember when I told sounds excellent.

149
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:15,449
Speaker 1: You might remember when I pulled this out of the box that I said the reason I bought this is because of all the Marvel Comics, I've read in my day good and bad.

150
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:16,554
Speaker 1: you know they.

151
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:26,757
Speaker 1: a lot of them refer to the Kree's Kroll war you know as as an major event in history that was super important and Such and that I had never actually read.

152
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:34,587
Speaker 1: you know what happened during this Kree's Kroll war that was so important that people keep Talking about it years later and keep referring to it in comics years later.

153
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,130
Speaker 1: good and bad.

154
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:41,187
Speaker 1: so I saw that there was a trade paperback of the Kree's Kroll war and I ordered it and I've read it.

155
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:45,638
Speaker 1: and Well I don't want to Peter on the bush.

156
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:49,030
Speaker 1: good God is the Kree's Kroll war terrible and painful to read?

157
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:50,455
Speaker 0: Why is it terrible?

158
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,421
Speaker 0: is it just stupid is it?

159
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:55,190
Speaker 0: is there something especially bad about it?

160
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:55,955
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

161
00:09:56,358 --> 00:10:02,267
Speaker 0: as a non-superhero Comic reader, I don't really how bad could it be?

162
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,482
Speaker 1: well Let me let me do a quote from the introduction here.

163
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:11,350
Speaker 1: the introduction is by Roy Thomas Who is the writer of the Kree's Kroll war and let me take a one sentence?

164
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,483
Speaker 1: I want to quote one sentence from this introduction.

165
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:19,182
Speaker 1: the sentence is Quote and if I may be unabashedly immodest for a moment.

166
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:21,448
Speaker 1: I think it holds up fairly well.

167
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:22,370
Speaker 1: end quote.

168
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,733
Speaker 1: This doesn't hold up Like a dime.

169
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:28,738
Speaker 1: I can't even think of feather.

170
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,442
Speaker 1: This can't hold up a fucking feather.

171
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:30,703
Speaker 1: all right.

172
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:39,828
Speaker 1: basically the deal here right is Primarily this should be about a war between the two alien races the Kree and the Skrull.

173
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:40,150
Speaker 1: right.

174
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:47,396
Speaker 1: No, I mean there isn't a war between the Kree and the Skrull going on, but barely I mean it's sort of.

175
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:55,550
Speaker 1: they say it happens and then at some point they Semi resolve it and then Kree and Skrull people sort of get involved.

176
00:10:56,094 --> 00:11:04,528
Speaker 1: Mostly, it's just a bunch of random Avengers Adventures, it's really hard to say and they're all really late Avengers adventures.

177
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:11,498
Speaker 1: Yes And They're all pretty lame Adventures if I may say so myself, it's pretty much.

178
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,103
Speaker 1: There's a bad guy.

179
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:20,505
Speaker 1: Oh, no, so I mean there's this one part It's like the worst of all is this incredibly unrelated part where one of the Avengers is the vision.

180
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:21,769
Speaker 1: He's like this Android, right?

181
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:26,201
Speaker 0: I've suddenly remembered the vision.

182
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,170
Speaker 0: yeah as opposed to a vision.

183
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:32,610
Speaker 1: Well the vision that you know the Avengers vision see is I have a vision.

184
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,925
Speaker 0: I have a vision of nothing but small mushrooms.

185
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:41,626
Speaker 1: as far as the eye He is an Android and the big it's like that the vision they keep saying.

186
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:42,890
Speaker 1: Oh, he's the Android.

187
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,021
Speaker 1: He has no emotions, right and he's.

188
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:54,019
Speaker 1: and it's so stupid because okay It's one thing to make an emotionless Android and I hate Star Trek But I know that that next generation has the emotionless Android.

189
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:57,490
Speaker 0: Well, well, well data didn't have emotions, but then he got emotions.

190
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,984
Speaker 0: All right, luckily he died right.

191
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:08,990
Speaker 1: but I Saw, you know from the maybe one or two episodes of that I seen he was actually an Android with no emotions, right?

192
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:09,581
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

193
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:11,135
Speaker 0: Wait a minute I think I see where you're going with this.

194
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:16,840
Speaker 0: you telling me that in a comic the characters will declare something like He is the emotionless one.

195
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:24,450
Speaker 0: He is the one who has no emotions But yet in the actual writing of that character There's plenty of emotions and that those declarative statements are just crap.

196
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:27,103
Speaker 1: Are you reading the mind of Scott rim?

197
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,330
Speaker 1: has the mind reading skills?

198
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:32,550
Speaker 0: I think based on my experience with it's like the whole Iron Man thing.

199
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,439
Speaker 0: I mean, I hear the Iron Man movies awesome, and I want to see it.

200
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:43,590
Speaker 0: but the the defense of the Iron Man comics I usually hear is but he was an alcoholic and it was interesting because he fought with his alcohol.

201
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:47,104
Speaker 1: Listen, listen, all right on the Iron Man alcoholism.

202
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:52,299
Speaker 1: I listened to a review of Of this a trade paperback of Iron Man.

203
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,426
Speaker 1: actually a hardcover Iron Man demon in a bottle.

204
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,870
Speaker 1: right get see the metaphor.

205
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:58,419
Speaker 1: See the metaphor.

206
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:07,073
Speaker 1: they're demon in a bottle because he's a guy Alcoholism demon in a bottle being a Superhero comic.

207
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,842
Speaker 0: there's literally a demon in a bottle that he literally fights.

208
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,367
Speaker 1: No, that wasn't it.

209
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,410
Speaker 0: That's that's surprising

210
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:33,185
Speaker 1: Yes But I listened to a review of that by Comic geek speak the comic geek speak podcast where they like superhero comics, right and most of those people Didn't like it and they complained that the alcoholism really only came into play and like one issue of the trade paperback And it was kind of just you know, oh, he's alcoholic.

211
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:34,289
Speaker 1: Oh, he's over it black.

212
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:37,142
Speaker 1: So people were like, oh I had man.

213
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:44,469
Speaker 1: the alcoholism is such a great story And the comic not so much really for at least according to people who know better than I do.

214
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,921
Speaker 0: There's a term for this.

215
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:52,847
Speaker 0: you see You know say you really really want straws, but they're just out of your reach.

216
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:53,630
Speaker 0: What do you do?

217
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,489
Speaker 0: What do you kind of grasp for him?

218
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:59,281
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the vision right.

219
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:07,153
Speaker 1: not only does the vision You know show emotion despite, you know, everyone's saying oh, he's the guy with no emotion He'll.

220
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:12,020
Speaker 1: actually there's a scene in which he's like, you know Trying not to kiss the Scarlet Witch cuz.

221
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,321
Speaker 1: he's like.

222
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,797
Speaker 1: and he's like wait wait wait Yes, okay.

223
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:21,789
Speaker 1: He's like no I mustn't I have no emotion Right.

224
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,349
Speaker 1: So that's pretty bad right there.

225
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:43,327
Speaker 1: Then you've got like this big long is seen in one of the issues where ant-man who recently left the Avengers Becomes small and goes inside the vision to see what's wrong with him Which has absolutely nothing to do with crease and or scrolls and or wars.

226
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:44,310
Speaker 0: Well, it's possible.

227
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,278
Speaker 0: Was there a Cree inside him?

228
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:48,326
Speaker 0: No, how about a scroll?

229
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:51,030
Speaker 1: No Not at all.

230
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:52,823
Speaker 0: This sounds excellent.

231
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:53,609
Speaker 0: How's the art?

232
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,710
Speaker 1: It's it's actually pretty typical art for the day.

233
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:03,145
Speaker 1: It's mostly you know If you it's sort of if you look at the art with the untrained eye of like.

234
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,410
Speaker 1: oh this is bad old art.

235
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,537
Speaker 1: But really the art is okay.

236
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:07,079
Speaker 1: It's just.

237
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:13,709
Speaker 1: it's limited by the printing techniques of the olden days You know just like all superhero art of those days was you know?

238
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:18,910
Speaker 1: I guess you know some of the character designs that were old-school and though, you know, like this is not.

239
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know cats in America looks alright actually, but he's barely in it.

240
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:24,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah.

241
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,763
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of stupid shit going on.

242
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,470
Speaker 1: For example, right Scrolls.

243
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,010
Speaker 1: The thing about Scrolls is that they're shapeshifters, right?

244
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:35,910
Speaker 1: So there's all sorts of cool stuff you can do with that and Marvel actually with their modern comics.

245
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:43,054
Speaker 1: There's there's like this secret invasion thing going on where the Scrolls are actually playing a big part and there's lots of Shapeshifting action going on.

246
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:58,270
Speaker 1: but in this the original crease scroll war the scrolls are shape-shifted into cows and Then they uncowed Aha, which is sort of a reference to the Scrolls previous appearance at a Fantastic Four comic because they actually said as much in the comic.

247
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:08,229
Speaker 1: But you know to sort of let me know that was what happened, but seriously cows They could have shaped it and all sorts of things but cows.

248
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:11,436
Speaker 1: Ah So yeah, it's just.

249
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:14,630
Speaker 1: the writing is just you know full of unnecessary narration.

250
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,663
Speaker 1: There's a fight of random bad guys in every issue.

251
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:22,166
Speaker 1: There's no real Reason to care about the characters or anything.

252
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,367
Speaker 1: It's stereotypical bad old superhero comics.

253
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:38,250
Speaker 1: and Actually reading it, you know cuz I thought at the very least reading this would give me sort of a backdrop for all of the Some of the better comics that have read that have given reference to this crease scroll war.

254
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,309
Speaker 1: I got nothing out of it.

255
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,240
Speaker 1: you there's no reason to actually read the crease scroll war.

256
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,603
Speaker 1: all you have to you in fact what you think what you Imagine the crease scroll war might have been like, you know it.

257
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:54,410
Speaker 1: when other comics reference It is better than the reality of what it was.

258
00:16:55,671 --> 00:17:10,375
Speaker 1: Don't even bother with this unless the only reason to read this would be if you're one of those people who has super strong Nostalgia for superhero comics of old and that enjoyment of that nostalgia is enough to pull you through Really bad writing.

259
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:14,589
Speaker 0: so Scott said before he went into that that there was no anime news.

260
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,349
Speaker 0: But no, there is some very important anime news that really you all really need to know.

261
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,182
Speaker 0: This is this is this is a tragedy.

262
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,657
Speaker 0: You see there is a company Super techno arts.

263
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,145
Speaker 1: Oh, I heard of them.

264
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:32,352
Speaker 0: There's an anime Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

265
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:37,124
Speaker 0: now if there's one thing I can say about Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, it is bizarre.

266
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:38,928
Speaker 1: It's also Jojo's.

267
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:39,249
Speaker 0: it is.

268
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:52,313
Speaker 0: It's weird because I want to say it's excellent But I don't know why because it's not but it's one of those things that's dumb and bad and at the same time Wonderful.

269
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:55,230
Speaker 1: See this actually because I was always weird.

270
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,590
Speaker 1: I would go to anime conventions before I really knew a lot about anime, right and you would go like the Bandai booth.

271
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,764
Speaker 1: They had all the Bandai stuff and you go to the genie on booth and they still exist.

272
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:04,930
Speaker 1: nail the genie on stuff, right?

273
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:18,470
Speaker 1: But there's always this one small booth and that one small booth had like one statue of a weird-looking anime character And it was like this anime company and all this anime company had to their name was Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

274
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:31,630
Speaker 1: So I always thought because there was just one company and they were the only u.s Company that had this one show Right and the show was called Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and the character design of that one statue they had look kind of lame.

275
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,299
Speaker 1: You know Knowing all that I thought huh?

276
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,330
Speaker 1: It's just this one bad show.

277
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:44,566
Speaker 1: That's obviously unpopular than no one likes No one cares about and that's why this is one weird tiny shit company trying to sell it.

278
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:46,312
Speaker 1: But whatever screw them I don't give a shit.

279
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,099
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually a little more.

280
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,762
Speaker 0: I mean cuz.

281
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,790
Speaker 1: yeah, that's what I thought back in the day.

282
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:52,089
Speaker 0: But then you know you get to RIT.

283
00:18:53,831 --> 00:19:00,090
Speaker 0: At RIT anime because they had the gigantic library of new they had a few VHS's and old anime.

284
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,576
Speaker 0: Yeah a few God.

285
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:02,680
Speaker 0: we got to find some pictures.

286
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,789
Speaker 1: I've had a few VHS's of Jojo's.

287
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was one of those things where all the old-school people in the club would be like, haha Jojo's they'd cuz.

288
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:15,635
Speaker 0: you know young kids would come up to the library and they'd be like What should I watch?

289
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:20,150
Speaker 1: and the first thing they would always tell them to watch is marmalade boy, which is not a good thing.

290
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,354
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on who you ask cuz.

291
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:30,779
Speaker 0: if you went over to the tape Nazi and like his faction in the anime club government They'd always say marmalade boy If you're already seen it, they'd say candy candy.

292
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,490
Speaker 0: and if you'd already seen that they'd say Kimoguri orange road.

293
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:43,295
Speaker 0: If you're already seen all three, well, they take you into the back and give you their secret fan subs Yeah of similar shows, but if you went to anyone else They'd either get it.

294
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,261
Speaker 0: No one wanted to give the obvious never.

295
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:52,382
Speaker 0: no one would ever say like just watch cowboy bebop Duh, or just watch eska flown a. they'd always give the kind of.

296
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:56,437
Speaker 0: here's the show that you would never think to watch But that you might like.

297
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,570
Speaker 0: so watch it and if you like it I will know what else to recommend to you.

298
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:03,418
Speaker 0: And if you hate it I will also know what else to recommend you.

299
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,310
Speaker 1: usually what people ended up doing is they would sift through the tapes.

300
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:14,130
Speaker 1: Right, as least what I did like, you know before I was cool I would sift through the tapes find something with an appealing title because basically have a blank VHS.

301
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:15,396
Speaker 0: That's how you picked up.

302
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:15,838
Speaker 0: like.

303
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,586
Speaker 0: well there was goo goo goo.

304
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:18,530
Speaker 1: I didn't pick up guys.

305
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:20,337
Speaker 0: I remember seeing it all the time.

306
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,104
Speaker 0: It'd be like goo goo goo.

307
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:22,988
Speaker 1: I remember that.

308
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:23,570
Speaker 1: be in the library.

309
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:29,090
Speaker 1: I would pick up a tape based on the name on the side of the tape and then show it and show it to someone.

310
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,953
Speaker 1: It'd be like is this good?

311
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:30,816
Speaker 1: Is this good?

312
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:31,880
Speaker 1: Is this good?

313
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:33,024
Speaker 1: And that's how.

314
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:36,740
Speaker 1: that's how I rolled in those days I think a lot of people rolled that way also.

315
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,710
Speaker 0: Yep, but you'd start to learn like.

316
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:49,658
Speaker 0: but this was one of those shows where people would be like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and then they'd come back the next week and they'd either be like So where can I get more of that?

317
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,750
Speaker 0: or they'd say never ever fucking recommend anime to be again?

318
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,578
Speaker 0: And there was really no middle ground.

319
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:56,604
Speaker 1: not much.

320
00:20:56,624 --> 00:21:03,281
Speaker 0: I like Jojo, but I Don't know if I like it in an ironic sense or not.

321
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,510
Speaker 0: I think I like it only in an ironic sense.

322
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:05,610
Speaker 0: I

323
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:17,669
Speaker 1: haven't read or watched enough of it to really know but what I do know about it sort of the meta information Is that there's like a whole bunch of different manga series and it's sort of Convoluting and hard to figure out which ones to read in what order.

324
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:18,915
Speaker 1: Convoluting.

325
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:25,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the TV shows and Movies if there are any I don't even know there's a movie or at least one.

326
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:32,543
Speaker 0: well, let me put it this way because I don't want to turn this into the Jojo show, but the super techno arts was releasing.

327
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:37,037
Speaker 0: well, they released the OAV and Basically, they went dark.

328
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:44,696
Speaker 0: if you go to their website as of now It says index of root CGI bin and robots dot text.

329
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,661
Speaker 1: All right, someone screwed up the web.

330
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,144
Speaker 0: So now they're gone.

331
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:49,227
Speaker 0: They're done.

332
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:58,261
Speaker 0: They're no longer distributing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure due to quote an unspecified issue in Japan.

333
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:08,510
Speaker 0: and that is the end of it, uh-huh Alrighty, then I'm not gonna read into it because I don't know enough about this company to be able to say what their status was.

334
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,762
Speaker 1: No, I have no idea what the deal was.

335
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:12,230
Speaker 1: All I knew is that it was always weird.

336
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:15,330
Speaker 1: There was one company that owned one anime.

337
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:18,803
Speaker 1: It was like they just they were just one license and that was all they were.

338
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:19,908
Speaker 1: and it was always sort of weird.

339
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:23,481
Speaker 1: and Because of that because of that weirdness I like didn't trust their show.

340
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:33,817
Speaker 1: and I think actually because of that weirdness You know, I think a lot of you know, people are people are fans of Jojo and I think because of that weird situation It actually is what held that show back.

341
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:34,359
Speaker 1: They had.

342
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,623
Speaker 1: now I think it's too late.

343
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:37,430
Speaker 0: They released a lot more than Jojo.

344
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:42,873
Speaker 0: Really they also had sci-fi Harry and Shadow.

345
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,421
Speaker 1: Whoa, I didn't know they had shadow.

346
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:46,404
Speaker 1: that changes everything.

347
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:55,940
Speaker 0: three OAVs shadow is action erotica shadow with an axe Alternative title hyper shinobi animation shadow.

348
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,465
Speaker 1: Ooh, that's a better name at least.

349
00:22:57,746 --> 00:22:59,250
Speaker 0: Yeah looks kind of recent.

350
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,720
Speaker 0: I'm getting this from anime news network.

351
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:01,949
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about this company.

352
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,581
Speaker 0: Sci-fi Harry is a Korean.

353
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:06,805
Speaker 1: It sounds like it could be funny.

354
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:07,808
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

355
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:08,210
Speaker 0: I'm dumb.

356
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,215
Speaker 0: Neo-psychic experiment.

357
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:14,790
Speaker 0: sci-fi Harry is a drama drama horror mystery psychological supernatural show.

358
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:20,230
Speaker 1: It sounds like my kind of action like the same kind of deal is like the opener is actually by John dark.

359
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,914
Speaker 0: I kind of like John.

360
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:28,510
Speaker 1: a lot of those anime that they would show on like the sci-fi channel, you know Sort of like not quite at the quality level of Akira, but the same sort of feeling.

361
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:35,410
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll have to acquire these two shows and review them and then end the horrible trifecta with an actual review of Jojo.

362
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,982
Speaker 1: We'll do this super techno arts.

363
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:42,370
Speaker 0: Try try Trilogy, that's a very Dave and Joel idea, but I think we should do it I would have made anyway.

364
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:48,629
Speaker 0: You can buy Jojo what's out there and I'm sure anything that is unreleased will get translated or whatever.

365
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:51,964
Speaker 0: I don't know I don't care but I find this interesting.

366
00:23:51,984 --> 00:23:54,644
Speaker 0: I'm curious what the unspecified issue is.

367
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,994
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

368
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,880
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say a lot about this.

369
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:10,378
Speaker 0: you may like this you may not but I can tell you one thing It's power level is over 9,000.

370
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:11,300
Speaker 1: I know it's exactly 9,000.

371
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,146
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess it is.

372
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:15,292
Speaker 0: you were supposed to say 9,000. no, no, I did.

373
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:16,495
Speaker 1: I said 9,000.

374
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:17,117
Speaker 1: I just didn't say 9,000.

375
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:17,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't say it.

376
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:17,959
Speaker 1: then 9,000.

377
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:23,313
Speaker 0: There we go It is exactly 9,000.

378
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:24,938
Speaker 0: Anyway, why is that to be 9,000?

379
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,222
Speaker 1: My power level is 10,000 bitches.

380
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:32,141
Speaker 1: Take that I Forged 9,000 guys, you're like.

381
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:32,865
Speaker 1: you're like fleas.

382
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:33,610
Speaker 1: I pick you away.

383
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,183
Speaker 0: I'm trying to remember what like super sane Vegeta whatever his power was.

384
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:43,050
Speaker 1: I never actually watched more than say 90 minutes of Dragon Ball in my life.

385
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:50,450
Speaker 0: So I watched a series of episodes and in every one of them Some someone was fighting some other people and Krillin was on the ground going.

386
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:57,662
Speaker 1: I remember once it was on the TV and we were in Jay's diner and it was literally just a Fat guy would say something.

387
00:24:57,683 --> 00:25:02,764
Speaker 1: He's like Fat guy would say something and that was the whole episode.

388
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:06,390
Speaker 1: That was over but death chaos.

389
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,520
Speaker 0: 9,000 is Something from like the old days of the internet.

390
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:31,110
Speaker 0: This is from back when there was no dig videos There wasn't even a YouTube and if if you wanted to find funny videos You pretty much went around and like there'd always be the one guy in your group who had like this collection of random funny Videos and then people would like trade funny videos and keep them on local hard drive.

391
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you'd have your hard drive and on your hard drive.

392
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,250
Speaker 1: You would have all these little video clips.

393
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:43,250
Speaker 1: They still have a bunch of them and you'd be like and someone would come over you like Hey check out my video clips and you didn't have YouTube's and you'd always like know him by the titles of the file.

394
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:47,988
Speaker 0: So he'd be like, hey man, you want you want a copy of but hot dog that a VI.

395
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:50,655
Speaker 0: no No, man, I got puddle jumper.

396
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,139
Speaker 1: Yeah puddle jumper is a good one.

397
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:15,048
Speaker 0: But this like before College Humor was around and There's this whole fun story that I think we could do a separate show on like the birth of College Humor in the history Of College Humor, but a lot of the lot of that stuff was from RIT and this video death chaos 9,000 was filmed almost entirely at RIT not only at

398
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:21,110
Speaker 1: RIT But most of it was filmed in the colony apartment complex where we lived for the most of our RIT stay.

399
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:24,603
Speaker 0: Yes, and except for the there's some scenes from Perkins.

400
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:29,989
Speaker 0: There's this one road that's in Perkins and One thing I want to say is you'll see a lot of fighting.

401
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:37,941
Speaker 0: That is the reason why Scott when he was injured at one point and went to the school doctor They asked him and made him sign a form certified.

402
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:39,307
Speaker 1: No, that was not exactly.

403
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,130
Speaker 1: that's not the story.

404
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,130
Speaker 1: The story is I went to the school doctor because I like hurt my leg, right?

405
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,198
Speaker 0: And they asked you if you were in a fight club.

406
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:46,740
Speaker 1: No, they didn't.

407
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,409
Speaker 1: what happened told me later on, right?

408
00:26:49,690 --> 00:27:00,554
Speaker 1: I was sitting at home on the computer and there was a knock at the door and it was two campus safety Officers and they said we received a report that you hurt your leg and I'm like, yeah They're like.

409
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,149
Speaker 1: we have to ask you if you're in a fight club.

410
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:08,650
Speaker 0: So basically the story I told was right except you decided to add the unnecessary detail.

411
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,232
Speaker 1: You mean the add.

412
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:14,110
Speaker 1: the most important detail wasn't the doctor who asked it was campus safety came and found me later.

413
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:15,575
Speaker 0: Well, you were asked by the school.

414
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,288
Speaker 0: But yes a fight club and I think your response was something.

415
00:27:19,408 --> 00:27:19,870
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

416
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty much like The campus safety guys answer was no.

417
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:27,215
Speaker 1: Yeah Wait a minute.

418
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:29,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think I'm in a fight now.

419
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,530
Speaker 0: had I been in the room?

420
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,681
Speaker 0: I pretty much probably would have piped up from somewhere in the apartment.

421
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:35,865
Speaker 0: the crap Scott.

422
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:45,130
Speaker 1: They got you better come clean Yeah, but here's the thing that I don't understand right, okay Of course, I wasn't in a fight club.

423
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,819
Speaker 0: However, there were fight clubs that are IT.

424
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,090
Speaker 1: not only that right, but if someone has a private fight club How is that illegal?

425
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,570
Speaker 0: Well, I it's not illegal as long as everybody has the police as long as everyone can sense.

426
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,157
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

427
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:01,021
Speaker 0: I don't know the legality.

428
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:10,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really I just you know I thought about it just now for the first time like even if there was a Against our policies that's for sure.

429
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:16,010
Speaker 1: But I'm saying like I just thought right now like if there was a fight club what of it?

430
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,449
Speaker 1: It's like we're not allowed to have a fight club if we want to.

431
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:22,210
Speaker 0: Well, I remember the time we were busted for all of us.

432
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,450
Speaker 0: We're basically trying to kill katsu but that that's a story for another time.

433
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I remember the campus safety guy runs over.

434
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:29,483
Speaker 0: stop it.

435
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:30,126
Speaker 0: Jesus.

436
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:31,390
Speaker 0: What are you kids doing?

437
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,221
Speaker 0: And then we all stopped and we're like what?

438
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:40,823
Speaker 0: yeah He's our friend and he looks at costume conscious like yeah Yeah, can we keep doing this?

439
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:41,146
Speaker 0: he's like.

440
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:46,054
Speaker 0: no Definitely not go away Disperse.

441
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:47,782
Speaker 1: I don't remember the guy coming over.

442
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:49,350
Speaker 1: I just remember I was sort of getting tired.

443
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,712
Speaker 0: We were.

444
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:51,479
Speaker 0: no we were dispersed by campus safety.

445
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,684
Speaker 0: Maybe it was a separate time.

446
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:53,889
Speaker 1: It might have been a separate time.

447
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,120
Speaker 0: Anyway, that was not the first nor the last time we did that.

448
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,882
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

449
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:59,930
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think I only did that one time.

450
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:14,450
Speaker 0: thousand RIT was like that in many ways but not like that in many ways because we don't take this as a as a Representative of what all of RIT was like as you could be at RIT and not run afoul of this.

451
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,845
Speaker 0: However, that is a big part of RIT's culture.

452
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:27,179
Speaker 0: all the things you were gonna say That is a subset of RIT that does indeed exist and you should be aware because I'll say this all the guys you see in That video we knew them now not in the.

453
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,163
Speaker 1: I didn't know.

454
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:31,154
Speaker 0: I knew maybe like let me finish Not in the like.

455
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,650
Speaker 0: you talk to them or you're friends with them or anything like that.

456
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:40,310
Speaker 0: But as in you see these guys and it's like I saw those guys on a semi-regular basis while I lived out.

457
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,010
Speaker 1: Alright, there's maybe one guy in that whole video that I somewhat recognize really.

458
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:48,664
Speaker 0: I remember specifically the guy in the hat who does the little heel click.

459
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:57,941
Speaker 0: I saw that guy a lot All right, I like I'd walk past him all the time and I always thought that's the guy from Death Cast 9000 alrighty.

460
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,667
Speaker 0: But Anyway That's all I got.

461
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:08,408
Speaker 1: Okay, so last night we watched some anime right and we're gonna talk about one of those anime right soon.

462
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:11,340
Speaker 1: But first I'm a big fan.

463
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:16,721
Speaker 1: I don't know why of Like kids anime like anime meant for like kindergarten kids.

464
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:22,446
Speaker 0: Scott will watch this one episode of furikapa like only because it's the only episode of furikapa.

465
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:28,373
Speaker 0: I have Furikapa Do.

466
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,769
Speaker 1: Furikapa is a great show.

467
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:36,824
Speaker 1: Go I learned I learned Japanese words from furikapa.

468
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:39,495
Speaker 0: Well, that's like yeah That's like Sesame Street.

469
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:42,767
Speaker 0: Like the word for today is mitten exactly.

470
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:46,180
Speaker 1: and then There are other ones like that penguin.

471
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,824
Speaker 1: no mondai.

472
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:47,930
Speaker 1: That was all right penguin.

473
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,794
Speaker 0: No mondai is fucking awesome.

474
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:56,571
Speaker 1: Then there was what was the other one with the the bunnies the Soggy some of all the construction working bunnies.

475
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:58,460
Speaker 0: that show is awesome times a thousand.

476
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:00,100
Speaker 1: I like that one, you know.

477
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:04,580
Speaker 0: No, that show was awesome because it's a little kid show and it's all these bunnies like in construction.

478
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:08,902
Speaker 0: But and they go all yakuza and fight Exactly.

479
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:09,525
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

480
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:16,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah Doraemon actually is okay I don't hate Doraemon, but I'm not as big a fan of it as I like some of these other ones.

481
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,886
Speaker 1: But anyway, so Emily was showing me this one Called cheese sweet home.

482
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:27,982
Speaker 1: now how she's sweet home and I'm linking to episode 1 of cheese sweet home on YouTube Subtitles.

483
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,467
Speaker 1: It's only like three minutes long.

484
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,631
Speaker 1: So you might as well watch it.

485
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:31,454
Speaker 0: I'll tell you one thing.

486
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,000
Speaker 0: You don't need subtitles.

487
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:37,960
Speaker 0: No, you know if well if you watch enough anime, you don't need some time, but basically she's sweet home.

488
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:46,789
Speaker 1: I think the alternate title and more accurate title to cheese sweet home is Uh Cute cat the anime cute kitty neko neko.

489
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:49,758
Speaker 1: we that's pretty much this whole three minutes.

490
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,123
Speaker 1: here is cute cat And you know what?

491
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:54,141
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of episodes of cute cat Like.

492
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,691
Speaker 1: I think there's like many many episodes of this.

493
00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:03,067
Speaker 1: So if you like cute cat cheese sweet home Hard to go wrong.

494
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,151
Speaker 0: It's a good show.

495
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:04,914
Speaker 0: I like it.

496
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:06,741
Speaker 1: It's not bad I'm.

497
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:10,339
Speaker 1: I could watch more cute cat if I had nothing better to do.

498
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:26,667
Speaker 0: Of course cheese sweet home is tainted a little bit by the show We're reviewing tonight because to get the show we watched last night out of our heads kind of like how if you eat something bad you try to like rinse it out with bleach or Maybe whiskey or something.

499
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,035
Speaker 1: That's all you but I use all you.

500
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:30,300
Speaker 1: I'll stick to my waters.

501
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:33,060
Speaker 0: So we decided to watch a little bit of cheese sweet home.

502
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,473
Speaker 0: But all I could think was I'm just waiting for the lesbians in the cooter.

503
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:38,736
Speaker 1: Good God.

504
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:41,185
Speaker 1: All right, so so We watch.

505
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:41,689
Speaker 1: we are go.

506
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,280
Speaker 1: he turned on my old the old computer.

507
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:48,040
Speaker 1: We went to the you know hard drive full of anime and we said let's pick one of these episodes and watch it.

508
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,190
Speaker 1: So one of the episodes there was project ice now.

509
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:54,300
Speaker 0: It is actually just called ice.

510
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Speaker 0: It's an OAV actually or ice the last generation now.

511
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:10,317
Speaker 0: This is important because after we had watched whatever it was that we watched We we we had to find out what the to use bad words the fucking deal was.

512
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:11,080
Speaker 0: what the fuck.

513
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:13,809
Speaker 0: So we went to the anime news network.

514
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,260
Speaker 0: We went to project, you know the P and we're looking for project ice.

515
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,765
Speaker 1: Oh, you're gonna jump for this right away.

516
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:19,849
Speaker 0: We couldn't find it.

517
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:27,279
Speaker 0: But while we were looking for it I noticed another anime I was of which I was hitherto unaware.

518
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:40,440
Speaker 0: This show is entitled no way out But it has an alternate Japanese title and because we were under project whatever looking for project ice I noticed the great the epic project boobs.

519
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,707
Speaker 0: Okay now project boobs.

520
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:59,200
Speaker 0: I got to read this description to you and then we'll leave it at that Because the fact that an anime called project boobs exists is not surprising in the least Unendingly hilarious to me, okay Yuki Miyagawa is a secret agent for a government organization.

521
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:10,216
Speaker 0: She and her colleagues Reiko kara yukiko and Kana Morishita are ordered to spy on a pharmaceutical company Under that is under suspicion producing illegal drugs.

522
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:23,054
Speaker 0: All right However, their activities are known to the company and they are caught by the researchers who molest them under the pretext of conducting Experiments, uh-oh, it's more than one episode direct.

523
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:28,386
Speaker 0: I'll leave it at that but It's not like a movie.

524
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,254
Speaker 0: it's it's project.

525
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:34,224
Speaker 0: it's directed by Suito machida.

526
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:35,929
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's a pen name or what.

527
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,474
Speaker 0: who is famous for?

528
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,520
Speaker 0: do you know the milthing man?

529
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:45,020
Speaker 1: So in OAV at least it's a clever title.

530
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,655
Speaker 0: Oh No toy key.

531
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:51,958
Speaker 0: All right enough with the funny hentai.

532
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:56,458
Speaker 1: Alright project ice perhaps worse than a funny hentai.

533
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,040
Speaker 0: now I'm 70 people rated this show on the animators network.

534
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,143
Speaker 0: I want to point something out.

535
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:05,516
Speaker 0: a non-zero number of people rated this with the highest possible rating.

536
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,920
Speaker 1: That is quite frightening.

537
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,525
Speaker 1: So project ice.

538
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:11,815
Speaker 1: basically the show starts out kind of interesting.

539
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:17,456
Speaker 1: Well, well, okay Well, it starts out where there's like a scantily clad girl, right?

540
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:32,351
Speaker 1: You're like, uh Right, and then a second later like she wakes up out of bed and like her brothers at the kitchen table, right and you're like Okay, this is pretty stereotypical it's gonna be like a pervy show but

541
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:32,592
Speaker 0: then

542
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,154
Speaker 1: but

543
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,903
Speaker 0: then I think we'll actually go through The.

544
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:37,009
Speaker 0: what happens in this?

545
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:37,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.

546
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:43,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then but to do the brief, you know Well, I think we'll go in long form here But briefly just to get you idea of where this goes.

547
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:48,456
Speaker 0: from there We end up in lesbian futuristic fits to the North Star world.

548
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:49,440
Speaker 1: Why are you giving away?

549
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:50,488
Speaker 1: All right, you got who.

550
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:51,640
Speaker 1: you got to pull that out later.

551
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:52,566
Speaker 0: I know I gotta pull that.

552
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:53,471
Speaker 1: I was trying to stop you.

553
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,840
Speaker 0: No, you don't pull that out later.

554
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,522
Speaker 1: No, you got it.

555
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:56,928
Speaker 1: You gotta save the surprises.

556
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,179
Speaker 0: No, I think the surprise is how you get from there to there.

557
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:05,859
Speaker 1: Anyway, so she starts talking to her brother and once they start talking you're actually like, huh?

558
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:09,360
Speaker 1: All right, they're not saying the stereotypical anime things.

559
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,849
Speaker 1: This is a kind of interested in this character.

560
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,560
Speaker 1: I kind of want to know what's going on here a little bit.

561
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,319
Speaker 1: You know, what's the deal with these people and you know that there's like an interesting thing happening here.

562
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:24,255
Speaker 0: All right Well, I'm also intrigued by the fact that her character design is straight out of golden boy.

563
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,880
Speaker 0: It looks like all those old.

564
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:37,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this really old-school character design, you know, the big hair big glasses Backgrounds also feel old-school, but they're definitely using much newer school animation technology.

565
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like everything's kind of washed out.

566
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:46,920
Speaker 1: and it's kind of weird though because the brothers character design was much more modern So they didn't really match up but that was kind of interesting in a way.

567
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,970
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this is a spoiler.

568
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,098
Speaker 1: but who gives a shit cuz you're not supposed to watch this show.

569
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:52,580
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

570
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:54,949
Speaker 1: She she goes outside.

571
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,296
Speaker 1: She's on her way somewhere.

572
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:56,919
Speaker 1: I forget where.

573
00:36:56,939 --> 00:37:04,378
Speaker 1: and You see like this weird mad obvious magical girl type character appear right and they're sort of looking at each other.

574
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:04,980
Speaker 1: ish, right?

575
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,831
Speaker 0: But then she's immediately hit by a truck and that's the end of that.

576
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,840
Speaker 1: she's dead and you're like what the fuck.

577
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:14,539
Speaker 0: So fast-forward to lesbian future fist of the North Star.

578
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,328
Speaker 0: Okay So before we get into the more detail now.

579
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:28,973
Speaker 1: so far this isn't painful yet because how many anime start with one thing Switch to something else and then eventually they tie it back to that original thing.

580
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:37,517
Speaker 1: That's you know, I can that's an Anime storytelling technique a trope that I'm not a fan of but it's been around a while.

581
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:38,360
Speaker 1: It can be done.

582
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:54,760
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't automatically make things bad, you know, it's it's acceptable all right, but that this show is one of those shows where you're watching and then it it's like it was directed or Made by yeah, I think here's the here's the creative process.

583
00:37:55,622 --> 00:38:01,240
Speaker 0: What if you made a show where like a woman gets hit by a truck and then there's lesbians, right?

584
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:10,775
Speaker 0: But then there's these robots, but the robots are all you know futurey and they're piloted by women But then they pull out guns, but the guns are like the technology the men.

585
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,100
Speaker 0: and there's all these twins.

586
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:16,040
Speaker 0: But then a woman shoved something up her cooter and becomes a giant crystal, right?

587
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,940
Speaker 0: And that's like the plot you see because then there's a baby but and and it's all about these babies in this ice.

588
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:25,075
Speaker 0: But but we gotta have robots and we gotta have planes.

589
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:29,272
Speaker 0: We gotta have lesbians Don't forget the lesbians and it's set in like, I don't know the future.

590
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:36,418
Speaker 0: and and there's giant robots fighting but maybe there's some virtual reality and and make it look like last exile, but not all the time.

591
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:46,637
Speaker 0: and Let's have a different character designer for every single character and all the men are dead Just like why the last man except that baby who has a penis Claire's day.

592
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:51,264
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so basically Everything rim just said.

593
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:58,025
Speaker 1: but what happens next is you get this flurry of scenes that are sort of Unrelated and you see all these characters.

594
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,652
Speaker 1: They all have really distinctive character designs.

595
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,955
Speaker 1: They're not well designed.

596
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:06,786
Speaker 1: They're all designed differently and Most of them seem kind of Blair.

597
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:11,320
Speaker 1: and you just get this flurry of characters thrown at you in this flurry of different settings.

598
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:12,447
Speaker 1: You don't know what time it is.

599
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:13,352
Speaker 1: You don't know where they are.

600
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,620
Speaker 1: You don't know what they're doing.

601
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,323
Speaker 1: You don't know anything.

602
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:19,180
Speaker 1: you see all these characters all over the place doing seemingly unrelated things.

603
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:26,131
Speaker 1: You know two girls with bikes on a highway a bunch of girls in a truck Yeah, a maid something else going on.

604
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:34,147
Speaker 1: You don't know and it just makes no sense until eventually the maid girl like Grabs this thing.

605
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:36,240
Speaker 1: Let's save that because you already gave it away.

606
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,552
Speaker 0: Anyway, no, but before because I feel like we should do.

607
00:39:38,572 --> 00:39:39,980
Speaker 1: there's nothing to happen before that.

608
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is.

609
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:42,713
Speaker 0: I feel like we should do a more Dave and Joel approach.

610
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:45,285
Speaker 0: actually just go through the whole plot So no one thinks to watch it.

611
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:50,491
Speaker 0: It's kind of like MD guys for plot doesn't start until this happens It starts before that.

612
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:53,206
Speaker 0: there's a lot of stuff Like you're forgetting a ton of.

613
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:58,199
Speaker 1: we're gonna end up talking more about how to talk about this terrible show than actually Talking about how terrible it was.

614
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:02,160
Speaker 0: I think a better way to go about it is to actually just go through the plot step by step.

615
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,746
Speaker 1: I am going through a step by step.

616
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:04,991
Speaker 0: Oh, you're forgetting something.

617
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,055
Speaker 1: What am I forgetting?

618
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:07,220
Speaker 0: This is our nations.

619
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:09,427
Speaker 1: What about the United Nations?

620
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:10,913
Speaker 0: and what happens with them?

621
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:14,106
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, and there's a bunch of other.

622
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:17,680
Speaker 1: well, that's why they do it so quickly that it's it's like you don't even notice.

623
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,426
Speaker 0: Before we get into all that I'd like to point out that part of the reason I'm interested because this show is directed by Makoto Kobayashi.

624
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:56,140
Speaker 0: now this person hasn't really directed much But if you look at their page on the anime news network if you're so inclined It's primarily mechanical design mecha design Conceptual design for robot shows and mecha shows like let's see Gundam double zeta Giant robo the gankutsu a robots the final fantasy unlimited mechanical stuff Venus Wars Trinity blood all these show steam boys super extra guy.

625
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,409
Speaker 1: That's not a bad resume of mecha design and you know what.

626
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,300
Speaker 0: but show has a bunch of really interesting mecha design.

627
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,842
Speaker 0: It's too bad.

628
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:06,233
Speaker 1: I'm not I mean, it's not the best man ever.

629
00:41:06,274 --> 00:41:07,600
Speaker 0: Here's the problem with the mecha design.

630
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:11,294
Speaker 0: So they've got last exile like you'll see him and you'll go.

631
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:12,740
Speaker 0: Oh, that's so last exile.

632
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:22,320
Speaker 0: But then they've also got guy my lefts Effectively and then they've got Akira bikes times a thousand with the most unrealistic winches I've ever seen.

633
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's really really inconsistent.

634
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:31,212
Speaker 1: this whole anime feels Like a whole bunch of people each individually made.

635
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:33,800
Speaker 1: they're like, hey you yeah make an anime scene on your own.

636
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,563
Speaker 1: What kind of scene?

637
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:34,924
Speaker 1: I don't know.

638
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:39,180
Speaker 1: just make a scene of anime and everyone made a scene of a different anime and then you?

639
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:40,869
Speaker 1: Sort of pasted all the scenes together.

640
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:42,599
Speaker 1: the scary part is is no AV.

641
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,479
Speaker 1: They expect people to buy this and this entire thing on one incredibly expensive DVD.

642
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:54,244
Speaker 0: So, let's see I mean the opening scene where I immediately decided all right The show is gonna be a porny show is.

643
00:41:54,304 --> 00:42:00,300
Speaker 0: it starts with a top-down shot of this old golden boy character design woman?

644
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:06,320
Speaker 0: Wearing a thong and there's a butt and the offense like there's a but there's a but there's a but we're gonna linger.

645
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:22,448
Speaker 0: But And then you know it cuts to this future world and Pretty much right away They introduced a million characters and the one that really stands out like all the characters are different character designs Like we said, but one of them this guy.

646
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:26,180
Speaker 0: now I say guy cuz it's actually a girl but it's I'm going with dude.

647
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:33,560
Speaker 1: I'm also going with dude the dude with blue hair whose character design stands out because it has blue hair.

648
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:38,240
Speaker 0: Not just that but the eyes are drawn differently and the face is different and the neck is way too small.

649
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it.

650
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:42,979
Speaker 1: basically it looks like a dude except this boobs under the uniform and that's it.

651
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:53,051
Speaker 0: It's kind of like how in utenna the way they made the characters is just they made every character a girl and then they randomly Just pick characters and remove the breasts and left everything as is.

652
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:53,733
Speaker 1: Yep.

653
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:55,699
Speaker 0: That was the old joke at our hair.

654
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,040
Speaker 0: pop There you go toga.

655
00:42:57,262 --> 00:43:03,739
Speaker 1: This is the opposite of Utenna where they would just they made all the characters and then just added boobs to all of them.

656
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:06,953
Speaker 0: So they introduced a billion characters.

657
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:08,519
Speaker 0: There's also the triplets.

658
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:13,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, they basically they don't really do anything, but you see hey, there's triplets.

659
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,429
Speaker 0: Why are they this long as seen?

660
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:20,160
Speaker 0: or the character in blue is going on and on about how you have to love people?

661
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,939
Speaker 0: And don't kill don't ever kill blah blah blah.

662
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:31,000
Speaker 0: We should just you know incapacitate and pacifism blah blah blah and just keeps talking and talking And all the other characters are even ignoring this person.

663
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,852
Speaker 0: I don't even remember any of the characters names except mint cuz.

664
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,820
Speaker 1: that's the person with blue hair and it's mint.

665
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,792
Speaker 1: That's why it matches with the hair color.

666
00:43:37,812 --> 00:43:39,039
Speaker 1: That's the only reason I can remember it.

667
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:54,587
Speaker 0: But all these characters are there and then they cut to the United Nations or the United States or the United States under the guise of the United Nations coming forward with all these crazy battleships to Japan and Basically announcing all right.

668
00:43:55,028 --> 00:44:08,245
Speaker 0: Well Japan because of our mutual defense treaty in order to protect you we're going to invade you and Japan responds over I guess a loudspeaker with No Yeah, and now here's the thing.

669
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:09,168
Speaker 0: and they start.

670
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:14,400
Speaker 0: they set up like this big fight and it's like the Army's coming in and the Other armies like getting ready to fight.

671
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:18,460
Speaker 1: What does it have to do with the girl in the beginning who was the only character even slightly cared about hook ahead by?

672
00:44:18,962 --> 00:44:25,203
Speaker 0: What does it have to do with all these other characters who are in some sort of military thing and they all have different colored Hair and they're all.

673
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:31,186
Speaker 0: they're all talking and going on some sort of mission, but their mission is to deal with Isis Which is totally yeah.

674
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:34,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the ice wait wait before we get to the ice.

675
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:40,540
Speaker 0: But then they cut away from the UN US Japan thing and they never go back to it.

676
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,040
Speaker 0: They not only they never go back to it, but it didn't even make sense to begin with.

677
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, so then they cut to this maid and right before this I remember saying well didn't they do the girls with bikes first?

678
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:55,020
Speaker 0: I don't remember if they did or not So I'll save that for later.

679
00:44:55,442 --> 00:45:03,980
Speaker 0: But they cut to this maid and right before that I had said You know The only thing the show is missing is like a bunch of maids and then it cuts to a maid and she's got a briefcase.

680
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:07,020
Speaker 0: So she opens this briefcase and we see a dildo.

681
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:10,851
Speaker 1: But well, we see a lot of weird shit and they're all dildo.

682
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:12,154
Speaker 1: It could be dildos.

683
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:13,237
Speaker 1: They're all dildo.

684
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:16,047
Speaker 1: It could be weapons It could be some sort of weird something.

685
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:16,348
Speaker 0: There's a.

686
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,280
Speaker 1: it's obviously something special and it looks like dildos.

687
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:26,965
Speaker 0: They're all dildos, but my brain used to anime says Obviously, these are not actually dildos They are something else.

688
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:34,180
Speaker 0: and sure enough she picks one of them up and while you could say yeah It's it's very phallic, you know, all cylindrical objects are phallic.

689
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:37,860
Speaker 1: So that doesn't really count for my but it had sort of science stuff attached to it.

690
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,500
Speaker 1: Like it's not like a pile of pink ooze a vial of pink ooze and some buttons and some switches.

691
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,180
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh it must be some sort of like, you know chemical spraying thing of magic powers.

692
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,468
Speaker 0: So she pulls it out and immediately starts caressing it.

693
00:45:49,729 --> 00:45:53,020
Speaker 0: Well, well, she starts caressing it and oh crap.

694
00:45:53,381 --> 00:46:05,844
Speaker 0: Oh, man, oh man, and I think to myself, you know If this were a horrible hentai to steal a word from Dave That's going up her cooter Right.

695
00:46:06,586 --> 00:46:14,109
Speaker 1: So eventually before I can finish thinking that right up the cooter Wasn't right at the cooter right away first, right?

696
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:21,360
Speaker 1: She starts running away because someone's chasing her right and it's like Characters have arrived and they're chasing her for some reason.

697
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,937
Speaker 1: So the whole time I'm thinking aha she's got the secret science and people are coming to get the secret side.

698
00:46:26,977 --> 00:46:27,519
Speaker 1: or maybe I?

699
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:38,315
Speaker 0: Actually what I thought I figured she's a terrorist and she's gonna like use this thing to turn into some sort of Biobot terrorism thing cuz yeah, they kind of like oh, there's bioterrorism.

700
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:38,937
Speaker 0: Yeah ice.

701
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,060
Speaker 0: Oh, no There's some ice happening in such-and-such.

702
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:50,468
Speaker 1: We got to go stop them and then she gets out on the floor puts the thing in the cooter and sprays the pink stuff Up there and then we cut away.

703
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:52,275
Speaker 1: and then at that point I remembered.

704
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:58,560
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right It's that like apparently at the beginning of the show when you see the girl who gets hit by the truck.

705
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:04,560
Speaker 1: That is in a time and place where men exist, but we've since learned men no longer exists.

706
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,347
Speaker 1: It's like why the last man they all died.

707
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:09,760
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh that has something to do with men not existing.

708
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,716
Speaker 1: Maybe that like impregnates her or something.

709
00:47:11,877 --> 00:47:14,263
Speaker 1: Yeah Pink sperm.

710
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:16,030
Speaker 0: so we cut back to all those characters.

711
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,375
Speaker 0: They introduced her on a bus.

712
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:18,620
Speaker 0: Well, it looks like a bus.

713
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:19,227
Speaker 0: It doesn't really.

714
00:47:19,248 --> 00:47:20,220
Speaker 1: it's like an army bus.

715
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:28,773
Speaker 0: It's like a bus with a zeppelin attached to it and it's flying and driving and there's a girl in the front waving a Shinto Stick and then oh, yeah, the shit does and the other characters come up.

716
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:30,340
Speaker 0: They're like stop waving that stupid stick.

717
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:30,845
Speaker 0: It doesn't do.

718
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:46,989
Speaker 0: she's just like yeah waving the stick Yeah, but it cuts to them again and they're like, oh shit ice Alright, so I assume so the ice obviously that made turned into some kind of terrorist Biorobot because she's impregnated and they're gonna go fight her.

719
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:50,600
Speaker 0: but then I don't know what happened.

720
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:53,468
Speaker 0: So it cuts to the.

721
00:47:53,608 --> 00:47:57,660
Speaker 0: I were like this giant pink crystal and in the setting is a blue crystal.

722
00:47:57,901 --> 00:48:04,209
Speaker 0: it was pink and in the center of this pink crystal is That girl and they and the ice.

723
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:10,893
Speaker 0: these people are all there and I don't remember if they were the same characters or not But they surround this crystal in like this force field.

724
00:48:11,175 --> 00:48:17,880
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was a blue crystal But then suddenly there's like two ices and two force field.

725
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,100
Speaker 1: Well, it's very weird because like though you'll see they they sat surrounded with a force field, right?

726
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,880
Speaker 1: But then they'll cut and they'll show you like this monster is coming out of the ice and they're fighting it or something.

727
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,200
Speaker 1: But then they'll cut and it's like it's surrounded by a force field.

728
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:30,762
Speaker 1: It's sort of like.

729
00:48:31,223 --> 00:48:40,060
Speaker 1: it's almost like there's two different dimensions you're seeing and it's like two alternate universes one in which the ice is doing one thing and one in which the ice is surrounded by a force field.

730
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,180
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that at all because they mentioned way back like oh, there's two ices two units, whatever.

731
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:52,139
Speaker 1: I think it was just a really shittily directed scene That in the end it was revealed that yes It was a really shittily directed scene.

732
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,966
Speaker 1: Apparently there were two teams.

733
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:58,722
Speaker 1: one team was going to deal with one ice incident and another team was going to deal with another ice Incident.

734
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:08,718
Speaker 1: so you have the one team that puts a force field around the maid We just saw and another team that's somewhere else that a team we've never seen before somewhere else dealing with ice.

735
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,740
Speaker 1: We've never seen before and they'd sort of switch back between these two scenes.

736
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:17,340
Speaker 1: So you really can't understand what the fuck at all is supposed to be happening.

737
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:23,060
Speaker 0: So what we see is basically we see our teams around this ice and they're all looking at it like ice ice.

738
00:49:23,323 --> 00:49:24,359
Speaker 0: It's an ice baby.

739
00:49:25,722 --> 00:49:37,799
Speaker 0: Well, speaking of ice ice baby, yeah, so suddenly one of the girls Sees a baby and it's crawling around next to the ice and it's got a got a wee wee.

740
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:39,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's happy.

741
00:49:39,287 --> 00:49:47,859
Speaker 0: It's like yay, and she freaks out pulls out the machine gun and Shoots the baby like with a million bullets.

742
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,760
Speaker 1: And then it's how the baby was just something she saw or if it was actually there.

743
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,443
Speaker 1: I couldn't either.

744
00:49:52,624 --> 00:49:55,678
Speaker 0: but she shoots the baby and then she turns and shoots the ice.

745
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:04,692
Speaker 0: and apparently the first rule of ice club is you do not shoot the ice because as soon as she shoots it it cracks and Like roots come out and fucking kill everybody.

746
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,959
Speaker 0: and here's the thing.

747
00:50:06,782 --> 00:50:09,593
Speaker 0: All right, the show decides to randomly kill all these characters.

748
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:13,827
Speaker 0: It did it in an Unnecessarily and unexpectedly gory way.

749
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:18,860
Speaker 1: It was pretty gruesome like they're chopping heads off and exploding goo everywhere.

750
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:20,340
Speaker 0: It was pretty bad.

751
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:28,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really didn't fit the show at all to have that kind of go cuts back to all the people who were still alive.

752
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,083
Speaker 0: And they're surrounding an ice.

753
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:38,536
Speaker 0: and then there's these little robots and out of the blue one of them appears and melts the head of one of the three triplets and then like almost all the characters we knew die.

754
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:43,239
Speaker 0: and then One of the triplets pulls out a little pistol and shoots the ice.

755
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:44,965
Speaker 1: Well, they were stupid.

756
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:47,940
Speaker 1: It was like it was like oh you dumb rookie you fire didn't you know?

757
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,703
Speaker 1: It would you know.

758
00:50:48,843 --> 00:50:56,380
Speaker 0: bounce off the wall and then it hit the ice and then up shit and the ice pops and the same Thing happens and fucking everybody dies.

759
00:50:56,862 --> 00:51:01,180
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of people die except this is one person and it was kind of weird.

760
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:03,619
Speaker 1: It's like on the bus or all the characters are hanging out.

761
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:05,547
Speaker 1: There was one person who wasn't.

762
00:51:05,587 --> 00:51:17,200
Speaker 1: they were in the bus also a dude, but not really not really a dude But looked like a dude effectively and this person was in a cage on the bus Locked up and they had lots of guns in the cage.

763
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:20,078
Speaker 1: But then who locks someone in a cage with the guns?

764
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:23,209
Speaker 0: now They pull out like before like in the lead-up to all this.

765
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:29,245
Speaker 0: they pull out this gigantic gun and they pull out these Pinochet bullets and

766
00:51:29,446 --> 00:51:31,652
Speaker 1: like one of them is a different color than the others

767
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:35,859
Speaker 0: and they go over and they unlock that girl's cage And they're like, here are the bullets

768
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,804
Speaker 1: letting you out

769
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,008
Speaker 0: now and then later

770
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:41,977
Speaker 1: on like this person some sort of dangerous weapon that needs to be let

771
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:42,198
Speaker 0: out.

772
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:59,385
Speaker 0: and later on this Person has the gun and loads it and is about to shoot the giant thing that was released from the ice Which is really stupid looking by the way And then gives this whole speech about and now I who remains will use the wicked Technology left behind.

773
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:04,780
Speaker 0: the evil legacy of men and she means men in the has a wee wee way very literally.

774
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:10,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean remember why the last man there's no men left and then she shoots the penis bullet at the monster.

775
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:22,023
Speaker 0: The penis bullet by the way is an atomic bomb pretty much and the explosion the size of the explosion from the penis bullet is Unreasonably large.

776
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:27,619
Speaker 0: It's just not reasonable at all now to back up from the penis bullet at some point along the way.

777
00:52:28,342 --> 00:52:32,740
Speaker 0: Show randomly cuts to these two girls on motorcycles like wandering around by themselves.

778
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,092
Speaker 1: I'm not sure exactly how they came into the show.

779
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:43,137
Speaker 1: one of the girls on the Motorcycle right was the magical girl you saw at the beginning when the truck crashed into the character We still have not seen again.

780
00:52:43,973 --> 00:52:44,239
Speaker 1: All right.

781
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:56,470
Speaker 1: the other one seems to be her sister or something and they had these Motorcycles and the magical girl seems to be up to something and the other girl is just sort of always standing near the bikes acting upset and They sort of cut to them every once in a while.

782
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:57,797
Speaker 1: Like what are they there for?

783
00:52:57,877 --> 00:52:58,038
Speaker 1: Huh?

784
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:58,380
Speaker 1: What are they?

785
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,887
Speaker 0: They find some canned crab and that's important.

786
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:02,491
Speaker 0: That's really important.

787
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:03,574
Speaker 1: I forgot about the crab.

788
00:53:03,855 --> 00:53:05,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, she finds the canned crab.

789
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:11,320
Speaker 0: She's like, oh snap canned crab and everyone she meets you eat canned crab canned crab and they're like what?

790
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:12,603
Speaker 0: Okay.

791
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:13,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

792
00:53:14,475 --> 00:53:17,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, but But that was totally unrelated to what's going on.

793
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,100
Speaker 0: But then this ice like gets out and it decides that what it wants to do is get on the freeway.

794
00:53:23,602 --> 00:53:30,050
Speaker 0: So it just starts flying down the freeway and the girl with the penis bullets is standing on it shooting it and it doesn't seem To care.

795
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:40,237
Speaker 1: All right She's standing on the monster riding it like a surfboard down the highway and eventually Passes by the girls with the bikes and the monster grabs one of the girls and just holds it.

796
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:47,846
Speaker 0: and magical girl and then the magical girls like ah, and then the other girl with the penis bullets is like All right, and just cuts.

797
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:50,655
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, don't forget like two characters have gun swords.

798
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:56,864
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah,

799
00:53:57,205 --> 00:54:14,339
Speaker 0: but and just like cuts her out of the thing and holds her and then you know thing blows up and one thing leads to another but The girl she saves the magical girl grabs her hand Puts it on her boob and basically says alright wanna have sex now

800
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:16,129
Speaker 1: And she's just like,

801
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,924
Speaker 0: uh, I'm not a lesbian And the other girls like.

802
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:24,960
Speaker 1: so what we're like friends is like friends, you know share bodies with each other.

803
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,286
Speaker 1: She's like no they don't.

804
00:54:26,406 --> 00:54:29,098
Speaker 0: and where I come from friends just talk to each other.

805
00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:45,313
Speaker 0: Yeah and and the thing is when she cried like she grabs her boob and With the other girls hand and then you realize that all the characters in the show have enormous Kazongas, no, some of them don't but well don't.

806
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,798
Speaker 0: they're hidden under gigantic armor.

807
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:49,520
Speaker 0: exactly They're there, you know, they're there.

808
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:56,019
Speaker 1: Well, I mean on the anime's news ever cuz genres romance science fiction themes Yuri, so yeah, Yuri's big.

809
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:03,184
Speaker 0: in this show There's a lot of Yuri going on in the world with no when they cut to like the the princess like evil Overlord woman.

810
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:06,778
Speaker 0: and there's the throwaway scene where she's like send me a couple of young girls.

811
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:07,239
Speaker 0: I'm bored.

812
00:55:09,023 --> 00:55:12,986
Speaker 0: And then it turns out that she has a million ices Like in her office full of maids.

813
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:14,511
Speaker 0: and she has a million maids.

814
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:17,600
Speaker 1: and the only other notable thing left to say about the show?

815
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,265
Speaker 1: Is the scene with the can crab base?

816
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:23,660
Speaker 0: All right, so you think the show has already gone in every direction it could.

817
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:25,584
Speaker 0: But you know what.

818
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:31,951
Speaker 0: there hasn't been enough Miyazaki there hasn't been enough like Nausicaa Valley of the Wind in this.

819
00:55:32,192 --> 00:55:33,740
Speaker 1: yeah, we've had every other kind of anime.

820
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,860
Speaker 0: We've had mecha's and you know magical girls maids Yuri boobs penis guns up the cooter.

821
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,692
Speaker 1: You know every genre of anime except the Miyazaki genre.

822
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:44,836
Speaker 0: So what do they do?

823
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:45,859
Speaker 0: is they go all Nausicaa?

824
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,440
Speaker 1: Basically, the magical girl has her can crab and like these birds come and you're just like Oh birdie birdie.

825
00:55:53,082 --> 00:55:58,380
Speaker 0: You forget she the girl who she tried to have sex with who saved her who is also the girl with a penis gun who?

826
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,002
Speaker 0: Was locked up.

827
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:05,213
Speaker 0: She's like, I'm gonna take you to see my special place But special place is not a euphemism.

828
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:06,219
Speaker 0: It's just a place.

829
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:14,926
Speaker 1: Yes and She sort of Tosses the can crab on the ground and his birdies come and his little birdies like birdie birdie birdie and they're eating the can Crab and it's like oh, isn't that nice?

830
00:56:14,966 --> 00:56:19,641
Speaker 1: these weird alien birds are eating the crab and the other girls like So.

831
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:26,110
Speaker 1: and then you see these birds from far away are coming and they're Gigantic, you don't know they're gigantic.

832
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,200
Speaker 1: He just looks like this birds more birds coming.

833
00:56:28,564 --> 00:56:29,839
Speaker 1: It's like oh more birds are coming.

834
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:36,040
Speaker 1: Right and then but for some reason the girl with the do is locked in the cage and has the gun.

835
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:40,516
Speaker 1: You know, the penis gun is like, ah, oh my god.

836
00:56:40,556 --> 00:56:41,500
Speaker 1: We should get out of here.

837
00:56:41,961 --> 00:56:46,660
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh there must be a lot of birds coming and they look maybe they're dangerous birds or something, right?

838
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,638
Speaker 1: Then the magical girls like no, it's okay.

839
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:53,007
Speaker 1: and Eventually the birds get there.

840
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:53,510
Speaker 0: now the fun.

841
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,680
Speaker 0: and then you realize the birds are gigantic.

842
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:59,076
Speaker 0: The one job one of the giant like the gigantic birds and I say gigantic.

843
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:06,616
Speaker 0: I mean Gargantuan like bigger than any dinosaur ever and that they come and they look at.

844
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:11,489
Speaker 0: one of them looks around and reaches down and picks up a piece of this crab meat.

845
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:22,539
Speaker 0: now that is the equivalent of me reaching down with my mouth and Picking up like a single bacteria like a deer tick and eating it and enjoying it.

846
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this giant bird.

847
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,940
Speaker 1: He's this tiny tiny tiny tiny piece of crab.

848
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:39,579
Speaker 0: She's like, oh and then a tiny little baby bird goes needs the crab and then it cuts to one of the birds and the bird He's still a crab and goes bird bird bird bird bird bird and then it rolls and becomes a green blob.

849
00:57:40,322 --> 00:57:42,068
Speaker 0: Yep, and so it's a green blob.

850
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:47,973
Speaker 1: all the little birds turn into green blobs and then all the big birds They all turn into big birds don't turn into green blobs.

851
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:49,500
Speaker 1: They sort of stand in this formation.

852
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:56,620
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, they stand in formation and then a Giant forest grows out of all the birds and they all turn into flower.

853
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,480
Speaker 1: I'll turn into plants and flowers and trees.

854
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:13,256
Speaker 0: but then if you pick a flower it turns into a tiny little bird and flies away and the scene has all this music and there's feathers and flower petals flying everywhere and They're saying those kind of heavy things that people in Nausicaa would say.

855
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:13,940
Speaker 0: and there's this.

856
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,200
Speaker 0: The science doesn't work that way.

857
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,389
Speaker 0: But that's what the the characters say stuff about.

858
00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:20,840
Speaker 0: the earth is poisoned and we're full of poison.

859
00:58:21,061 --> 00:58:23,309
Speaker 0: But these birds are pure and blah blah blah blah.

860
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:25,899
Speaker 1: and then the other characters like but this it doesn't work that way.

861
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:26,644
Speaker 0: Now then

862
00:58:26,664 --> 00:58:27,287
Speaker 1: a bunch of shit

863
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:55,473
Speaker 0: in the middle of all this where you know They can't just end on it and anything even remotely artistic or poignant even though it's faux poignant at best It cuts to the girl who was with the magical girl who is from the above looking down and sees this going on and I point out that earlier on there's actually one good scene probably only good scene where she stumbles upon I guess the wreck of one of those buses or something and attached to it are all these rocket launchers.

864
00:58:55,694 --> 00:58:56,719
Speaker 0: and she sees him and she goes.

865
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:59,207
Speaker 0: ah And the next scene with her.

866
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:02,260
Speaker 0: basically she's covered her bike in rocket launchers.

867
00:59:02,743 --> 00:59:03,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was pretty funny.

868
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,780
Speaker 0: But then you see her and she's looking down.

869
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:14,539
Speaker 0: she sees this going on and She says well, I'm totally going to kill those two and she pulls out one of the rocket launchers and then the episode ends.

870
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:18,870
Speaker 0: Yep, I don't know what there really.

871
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:36,351
Speaker 1: there was a weird scene involving a character I never saw before right somehow involved with the girl who is in the opening scene that got hit by the truck like somehow like it was looked like some sort of afterlife netherworld kind of place and Something about someone possessing someone or something.

872
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:38,500
Speaker 1: I don't know and it made no sense whatsoever.

873
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:45,759
Speaker 1: So the one character that there might have been a reason to care about a little tiny bit ends up Do doing something that I can't understand?

874
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:51,072
Speaker 1: this show Was awful is pretty terrible.

875
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,720
Speaker 1: Maybe one of the worst shows I ever seen.

876
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,678
Speaker 0: I don't know why I watched the whole thing because it's one of those things where all right This is dumb.

877
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,648
Speaker 0: But I at least want to know what the deal is.

878
00:59:58,668 --> 01:00:05,120
Speaker 0: and then not only do not find out the deal But I imagine I posit that the deal is just bullshit.

879
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:10,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really I gotta say Yeah so to not leave you hanging.

880
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:21,800
Speaker 0: at the end the girl who is the the penis gun girl in her head has a vision of The girl from the real world from the opening and it turns out that that girl from the oh, is that how it went?

881
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:29,500
Speaker 0: Yes Is actually from the past from when there were still men and she magically has all the memories of the penis girl.

882
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:32,752
Speaker 0: Well, the penis gun girl, I don't think there are any penis girls.

883
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:38,299
Speaker 1: I hope to God there aren't Although it's gotta go to every genre.

884
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:52,100
Speaker 1: I really know you look at the credits of this show and it's made by all these people who have Experienced in the anime industry, but they're all key animators mecha designers lower-level Animators and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

885
01:00:52,541 --> 01:01:04,100
Speaker 1: But you the the lack of experience shows and it really is this sort of hacked together Sort of I guess some moderately well animated piece of junk.

886
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,526
Speaker 1: There's the writing.

887
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:07,132
Speaker 1: there's no writing to speak of.

888
01:01:07,152 --> 01:01:08,398
Speaker 1: It's just a big.

889
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,589
Speaker 1: well It's just a big mess.

890
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:21,868
Speaker 0: the person who wrote the screenplay for this Yasushi Hirano, uh did among other things Mobile suit Zeta Gundam the script.

891
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,513
Speaker 0: All right, not bad.

892
01:01:23,594 --> 01:01:27,809
Speaker 0: Yeah the script of that and the script of this All right, well the screenplay I guess.

893
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:32,770
Speaker 1: oh, so that's not actually writing the story that's just Taking the story and adapting it.

894
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:34,680
Speaker 1: for you know, it's a screenplay for yes.

895
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:40,619
Speaker 0: Also the screenplay for eight men after which I kind of like yeah, it's not too bad that bad.

896
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:44,593
Speaker 1: No, no, it's it's not as good as I guess the original Tobor the eighth man, right?

897
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:44,995
Speaker 1: Yeah.

898
01:01:45,055 --> 01:01:48,220
Speaker 0: Well, they added a lot of Early.

899
01:01:49,141 --> 01:01:50,225
Speaker 0: Well early 90s.

900
01:01:50,245 --> 01:01:51,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, that shows from like 94.

901
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,113

905
01:02:00,977 --> 01:02:01,920
Speaker 1: It makes no sense.

906
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:10,851
Speaker 1: It's just a bunch of random anime shit sort of slapped together and somehow forced to relate to each other in a way.

907
01:02:10,891 --> 01:02:17,268
Speaker 1: that makes no sense and it is not worth the Large amount of time it takes to watch it or not.

908
01:02:17,308 --> 01:02:20,095
Speaker 1: It's not even worth the free download of illegalness.
