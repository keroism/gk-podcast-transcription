1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,314
Speaker 1: It's Thursday July 15th.

2
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:11,557
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:20,190
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight, Kineticon 2010.

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,228
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,361
Speaker 1: So technically we were back from Kineticon Tuesday.

6
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:32,214
Speaker 1: We did that show that was one of the crab ist crab people We've done in a while.

7
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:33,983
Speaker 0: We were back from Kineticon on Monday.

8
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,048
Speaker 0: We just didn't do a.

9
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,941
Speaker 1: yeah I didn't have my voice back yet.

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,835
Speaker 0: I Didn't lose mine.

11
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I lose my voice much more readily than you do.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,803
Speaker 1: This is a well-known bit of trivia and geek nights.

13
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,029
Speaker 0: I'm gonna build the skills.

14
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:48,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly what killed me, you know, we didn't even do that?

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,004
Speaker 1: many panels.

16
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,290
Speaker 1: We did like between us.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,810
Speaker 1: We did what like six or seven panels not counting the ones I guess we've kind of threw together at the con.

18
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:55,333
Speaker 1: I mean the old.

19
00:00:55,373 --> 00:01:00,535
Speaker 0: well, I mean that's pretty much the max we've done not counting the Kineticon where we did a room.

20
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:04,266
Speaker 1: Oh my god, that was possibly not counting that one time.

21
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:05,670
Speaker 0: six or seven is like our max.

22
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:08,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, and even then I don't like to do six or seven.

23
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:09,629
Speaker 0: I like to do three or four.

24
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:17,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, because of course it's different at Kineticon because we're actually like the heads of panels Like we're both the co-directors of panels and workshops for Kineticon.

25
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,450
Speaker 0: So we give ourselves that our panels we want.

26
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:23,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually think we didn't do our panels as well.

27
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:25,470
Speaker 0: Well, maybe we should talk about that in the other part of the show.

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, well all meta but Kineticon, you know wrecked me partly because we had to run around.

29
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,270
Speaker 1: you had the radio on.

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,977
Speaker 1: I'm responding to stuff like rim.

31
00:01:32,997 --> 00:01:34,102
Speaker 1: this panel has disappeared.

32
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:38,422
Speaker 1: rim Microsoft wants a panel in this room But there's someone else already in here that you scheduled.

33
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:39,468
Speaker 1: We didn't tell you about that.

34
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:48,655
Speaker 1: so we you know dealing with all that stuff and On top of that doing a bunch of panels and not taking the Monday off Like I usually do after a con like that.

35
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,320
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm that about wrecked me.

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,590
Speaker 1: So crab people on Tuesday, and I guess we're back.

37
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:55,118
Speaker 1: I think we're back in our full swing today.

38
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're good though.

39
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:57,210
Speaker 1: I do want to address.

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,501
Speaker 1: Several people asked what we meant by crab people at.

41
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,114
Speaker 0: we've explained that like ten times maybe a long time ago And I do.

42
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:06,261
Speaker 0: they not watch South Park.

43
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:07,750
Speaker 1: Maybe not or maybe they don't remember.

44
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:10,489
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what I'm not even gonna tell you again.

45
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,424
Speaker 0: You can either go and find an old episode of.

46
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:22,478
Speaker 0: you can answer we Explain it or you can go and get the appropriate South Park DVD and listen to the 30-second commentary And you'll figure it out man.

47
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:25,530
Speaker 1: That commentary really makes me want to get those DVDs just to watch it.

48
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though it's free online.

49
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,320
Speaker 0: That's pretty much like normally.

50
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,249
Speaker 0: I don't watch commentary on anything except South Park firefly.

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,330
Speaker 1: I watched the commentary whatever and a doctor horrible because it was a. basically it was an alternate musical to the musical.

52
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, what it was just sung commentary.

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,810
Speaker 1: I know you don't like anything good like firefly and doctor anything bad.

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,940
Speaker 1: Anyway, the South Park commentary is great.

55
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,065
Speaker 1: They talk for like 30 seconds.

56
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,010
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe a minute Maybe but the thing is they don't do it for the whole episode.

57
00:02:55,211 --> 00:03:01,154
Speaker 0: So it's like it's basically like when you read a webcomic and then you buy the book of the webcomic and there's like a little Note under each comic.

58
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:03,001
Speaker 0: like yeah, I wrote this and I was drunk.

59
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,490
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this is this game used to be awesome.

60
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:10,350
Speaker 0: Hey, whatever happened to that, you know And I like the penny arcade books exactly.

61
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,910
Speaker 0: So that's that's what South Park DVD commentary is like and it's totally worth it.

62
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,473
Speaker 0: They should put it on.

63
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:18,230
Speaker 0: if it I'd say they should put it on the website, but then why would anyone buy the DVD?

64
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:32,926
Speaker 1: So I feel like a long time ago We were trying to do a geek nights DVD and that that petered out mostly for the fact that it's infeasible Even just the technologically speaking even if we did per topic in low quality.

65
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,470
Speaker 1: We cannot fit them on DVDs.

66
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:36,740
Speaker 0: We'd had to use blu-rays, but then what's the point?

67
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,039
Speaker 1: or USB sticks, but then it's too expensive Yeah, and we were talking about well Maybe we'll just do like a selection and a value add.

68
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:47,983
Speaker 1: if we ever do commentary on geek night someday We'll just have to listen to an episode and do like the one minute.

69
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:49,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, that episode sucked.

70
00:03:50,052 --> 00:04:00,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like a DVD is for gigs like even if we got cheap one gig USB sticks not gonna cut it We need 16 gig sticks or something like that.

71
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,370
Speaker 0: It's gonna be ridiculous.

72
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:06,950
Speaker 1: So you were you were talking up like you got something you can say some open event some way to roll the show in.

73
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:08,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know I've had some.

74
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,600
Speaker 0: You know, I am a healthy person.

75
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,049
Speaker 1: Oh god this again the fungus.

76
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:14,237
Speaker 0: But you know, I don't.

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,108
Speaker 0: I you know, I have some medical issues but they're never medical issues that actually are like.

78
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,733
Speaker 0: You know for serious like I need to go to an emergency room or I need to take a medicine or you know Anything like that.

79
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:27,886
Speaker 1: There was that one time you had the the injury from the Fight Club at RIT.

80
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:28,630
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right.

81
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,378
Speaker 0: But you know, that was a. that wasn't an illness.

82
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,281
Speaker 0: That was a physical.

83
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:33,565
Speaker 0: There's a wound.

84
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:34,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone can get wounded.

85
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,948
Speaker 0: I mean in fact only men get wounded.

86
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,314
Speaker 0: Getting wounded is manly.

87
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,780
Speaker 0: that's better than being just healthy.

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,590
Speaker 1: So well manly doesn't have anything to do with gender.

89
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm obviously if you've listened to any of our shows about Randy ness, right?

90
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:55,076
Speaker 0: I'm obviously not someone who you know is like an old guy who doesn't want to go to the doctor when he's actually Never understand those people.

91
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:57,043
Speaker 0: if I want to go to the doctor.

92
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:59,669
Speaker 0: Trust me the only time I got a problem I gotta go there.

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,355
Speaker 1: Here's the thing one.

94
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,128
Speaker 1: I don't go to the dentist when I should I go.

95
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:03,798
Speaker 0: I didn't go to the in.

96
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,610
Speaker 0: the thing is I didn't go to the doctor or the dentist.

97
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,513
Speaker 1: No, it was a pain in the ass.

98
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:08,521
Speaker 0: not cuz I didn't want to cuz I didn't have time.

99
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,425
Speaker 0: I was moving.

100
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:12,759
Speaker 0: I was conventioning I had something going on every weekend.

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,583
Speaker 0: I was busy at work.

102
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:14,930
Speaker 0: I couldn't take a time off from work.

103
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:19,670
Speaker 1: Even now we've cut a lot of conventions out of our schedule and I look at it and it still wrecks me.

104
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,250
Speaker 1: I look back to when we would go to like 12 conventions over the course of a year.

105
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,050
Speaker 0: We should look and look at exactly each year and figure out which year was the busiest.

106
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,216
Speaker 1: I think we peaked like.

107
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:29,100
Speaker 1: remember that one year.

108
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,889
Speaker 1: We even went to freakin anime next.

109
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:34,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is that year we went to anime next.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,890
Speaker 0: we didn't also do like anime boss now, but we did do course.

111
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we did anyway.

112
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:49,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I went to the dentist right a couple weeks ago And of course, right, you know, this is this is some advice for anyone out there.

113
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:54,790
Speaker 1: You're gonna say and I quote I quote a very important music video brush your teeth brush.

114
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,362
Speaker 0: Well, no, I brush my fucking teeth.

115
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,310
Speaker 0: What the fuck do you think this is?

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,671
Speaker 0: I don't know.

117
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:08,296
Speaker 0: and no is that you know, even if it means like taking a day off from work when it's super busy or You know losing a weekend or something Don't not go to the dentist.

118
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:22,289
Speaker 0: cuz even me brushing and flossing I had filling so the one dentist Appointment turned into three because I had to go for the left side and then on Saturday and going for the right side You know, and so today I went to the doctor for the first time, you know to get some side of the stuff checked

119
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,450
Speaker 1: out.

120
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,394
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I noticed your little.

121
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,298
Speaker 1: uh, they took blood.

122
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,866
Speaker 0: They stole my magical blood.

123
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,649
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're gonna do.

124
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,272
Speaker 1: They're gonna grow a race of supermen They were.

125
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,882
Speaker 0: they asked me do you want to test for STDs?

126
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,170
Speaker 0: and I'm like, I don't know if that'll be necessary.

127
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,655
Speaker 0: Is that gonna be?

128
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:42,969
Speaker 0: I was like, I mean if it doesn't cost anything extra and if it's no extra trouble for you I mean you can answer not you'd better test me for all of them.

129
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:45,901
Speaker 0: No, the doctor was like are you sexually active?

130
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,524
Speaker 0: I'm like not.

131
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:47,550
Speaker 0: right now, do you know anybody?

132
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,416
Speaker 0: But you know the thing is part.

133
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:59,590
Speaker 0: another reason that I didn't go to a doctor right is cuz when you're growing up you've got A doctor because your parents get a doctor for you, right and you stay with that doctor like all the way through high school.

134
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,946
Speaker 0: Probably yeah, right, but then you leave but you go to college.

135
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,697
Speaker 1: you go to college You get that nurse for like a couple years.

136
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:13,310
Speaker 0: Well, no you go to college and the school usually has doctors So you don't need to find one you just go to the school doctor Like you go to the school nurse when you're in high school, right?

137
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:19,604
Speaker 0: So when I was at RIT and I had the wounded leg I went to the RIT doctor and they were like are you in a fight club?

138
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:23,199
Speaker 1: and then campus safety came by later and they Were like will you sign that you're not in a fight club?

139
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,862
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah.

140
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,555
Speaker 0: No, I should have told campus safety I'm in ten fight clubs.

141
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:28,444
Speaker 0: I'm the fight club champion.

142
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:29,710
Speaker 1: You should be like, where do you think I got this?

143
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,830
Speaker 0: Where do you think I had these trophies?

144
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,295
Speaker 1: You should have made a trophy

145
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:50,150
Speaker 0: a broken piece of a bicycle from them from the front foyer anyway, so Part of the reason I didn't go to a doctor since I you know left RIT, you know I think I went to a doctor once and I just picked the one that was closest to the house in Beacon Right is because I didn't know what doctor to go to.

146
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,322
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of doctors and you go to the insurance company's website And how do you know which one is good?

147
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:55,370
Speaker 0: there could be you know?

148
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,770
Speaker 0: I've heard of real doctors telling you to get the acupuncture and the chiropractic and the homeopathy, right?

149
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,190
Speaker 0: So if I can't even trust a real doctor, who do I you know?

150
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,083
Speaker 0: I really don't want to waste my one doctor visit on a BS doc.

151
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:10,267
Speaker 1: Well, the BS doctor sucks.

152
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,270
Speaker 1: Just go to another doctor.

153
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then the insurance is like why did you go to two doctors?

154
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,457
Speaker 0: And I'm like the first doctor sucked Like we ain't covering that second doctor.

155
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:17,980
Speaker 0: and you know what.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,224
Speaker 0: you know how much I paid to go to the doctor today $20, you know what the says on the bill like 400 something right?

157
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:32,105
Speaker 0: I could have gotten like two or three wheeze I could have gotten like nine video games for the price of the doctor if I didn't have any right.

158
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:39,592
Speaker 0: and that's the reduced insurance Rate because people don't know this right, but let's say you go to the doctor right and the doctor is $500.

159
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,109
Speaker 0: I'm picking a nice even number, right?

160
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:49,850
Speaker 0: If you go with insurance, not only does the insurance pay for most of it except the copay or whatever they're gonna do But the price is actually lower.

161
00:08:49,970 --> 00:09:00,749
Speaker 0: So the insurance would only give them 300 and you give them 20 and the doctor actually makes less money When you're paying with insurance than if you're paying with cash, right and that's why insurance is a scam.

162
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,070
Speaker 0: It's BS.

163
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:04,776
Speaker 1: It's not so much that it's a scam That's like that.

164
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,670
Speaker 1: collusive business practices like that are problematic.

165
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:13,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like if I went to the gas station and I had a Ford so the gas was a dollar a gallon But I have at a Chevy it'd be three dollars.

166
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,270
Speaker 1: I think we need gas neutrality.

167
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,900
Speaker 0: I think we definitely need you know doctor price neutrality.

168
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,526
Speaker 0: the price of a physical should be the price.

169
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,450
Speaker 0: there should be this bargain.

170
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:21,394
Speaker 0: Oh negotiating.

171
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,464
Speaker 1: Anyway, we can do it based on weight more person.

172
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:24,830
Speaker 0: Let's not turn that into the show.

173
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,196
Speaker 1: alright, so so you're.

174
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:31,942
Speaker 0: so because of busyness and because of Untrusting and wearing this of Randy doctors.

175
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:36,061
Speaker 0: I delayed going to the doctor but went to the doctor today and you know what the way.

176
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:50,262
Speaker 0: I picked the doctor as it went to the insurance company's website and I picked the one that was close to work that had the letter E because apparently e according to the insurance company website says that they adhere to evidence-based medicine practices like a Certain percentage of the time more than other doctors.

177
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:50,664
Speaker 0: Wow.

178
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:51,990
Speaker 1: I wish I had a metric like that.

179
00:09:52,150 --> 00:10:01,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was just a symbol that was like e or not e there wasn't any sort of number Etosiated with it and you know what the doctor I went to is probably the best doctor I ever went to.

180
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:06,785
Speaker 0: it was like They'd like the perfect doctor and I was kind of worried when I walked in.

181
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:10,579
Speaker 0: cuz it was like NYU and I'm like Oh shit that I accidentally go to the college doctor.

182
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,826
Speaker 0: I'm not a student, but I saw old people in there.

183
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:21,301
Speaker 0: So I Students now just old real old people and apparently as opposed to fake old people The only reason it's NYU is because it used to be st.

184
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:22,726
Speaker 0: Vincent's apparently but he's like.

185
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,735
Speaker 0: you probably heard that st Vincent's went under.

186
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,470
Speaker 0: if you've been in New York, I'm like, no, I only been here for like a little while.

187
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,754
Speaker 0: I didn't know anything about that.

188
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:32,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, but apparently it just means that the doctors are also faculty.

189
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,130
Speaker 0: That's all it means.

190
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,576
Speaker 0: So alright, it was totally.

191
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:36,880
Speaker 0: if anyone needs doctoring.

192
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,823
Speaker 0: I don't know.

193
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:40,070
Speaker 0: I guess there's laws about recommending doctors, isn't there?

194
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:41,578
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

195
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,370
Speaker 0: But anyway, it was a cool doctor.

196
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:51,803
Speaker 0: but now I've got a referral to the dermatologist to check on my the fungus fungus in the hair and You know, I got another referral for another doctor.

197
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:52,869
Speaker 0: So I will see what's going on.

198
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:54,636
Speaker 0: I never had referrals before.

199
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,783
Speaker 1: so now now that's cuz we're old.

200
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:06,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're old But otherwise, I was completely healthy like the doctor started asking me questions and I was like, you know It was like you're taking an oral exam not an oral exam.

201
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,726
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know He's looking in your mouth but an oral exam like a test in school where you say the answers.

202
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,375
Speaker 0: and he was like Do you drink alcohol?

203
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:15,037
Speaker 0: I'm like, nope.

204
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,783
Speaker 0: He's like you drink coffee.

205
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,650
Speaker 0: I'm like, no, I'm winning here.

206
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,619
Speaker 0: I got all these like the exercise easy.

207
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,745
Speaker 1: Like do you drink orange juice?

208
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:25,416
Speaker 1: Oh shit Man, it was like.

209
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,560
Speaker 0: he's like do you exercise?

210
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,646
Speaker 0: I'm like I didn't but now I'm biking to work.

211
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,589
Speaker 0: So mmm my win.

212
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,538
Speaker 0: I was like I beat you doctor you lose.

213
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like damn it.

214
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:35,830
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a fat guy coming in next got him.

215
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:46,770
Speaker 1: yep, that's right, so Otakon has done something that anime Expo should have done and Because of the nature of the culture pretty much every convention should be doing this.

216
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,528
Speaker 0: Every intelligent convention is already doing in advance because they have foresight and thinking in their brains.

217
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:55,663
Speaker 1: Yep The vuvuzela is not welcome at Otakon.

218
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,105
Speaker 0: All right.

219
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:59,753
Speaker 0: Well the thing is, all right, so they get All right.

220
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:10,070
Speaker 0: banning the vuvuzela is is well and good right but the thing is shouldn't they just ban all they already do not All noise-making devices other than you know, I mean he's got well.

221
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,432
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

222
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:17,430
Speaker 1: most cons have bans already against disruptive behavior and against like all you know A generic kind of statement about noise makers and things.

223
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:30,820
Speaker 1: I think the purpose of this vuvuzela specific ban is that because of the culture right now people are like like I've seen if I was poking around because People are split weirdly about this ban.

224
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:33,690
Speaker 1: A lot of people are like damn Otakon taking away my fun.

225
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:40,412
Speaker 0: I think that the vuvuzela should only be banned if you you know, you should be allowed to bring one in and I don't think You should.

226
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,616
Speaker 0: here's why are you ready?

227
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:44,907
Speaker 1: If the crowd is big enough, you cannot deal with it quick enough.

228
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:50,241
Speaker 0: Here's why What if I the Otakon has this musical area right?

229
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:53,610
Speaker 0: what if I am bringing in my vuvuzela for legitimate music playing purposes?

230
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:55,188
Speaker 1: So, you know what?

231
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,680
Speaker 0: I mean I could bring in a trumpet right and I could say and they would totally let me in because I'm gonna go play Music in that band area right?

232
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:02,930
Speaker 0: They have the band area, don't they?

233
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,276
Speaker 0: So here's the way they would they wouldn't even question that.

234
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:15,910
Speaker 0: but if I play my trumpet in an annoying way in the otterbean lobby And pissed everyone the hell off then you may confiscate my trumpet or my badge.

235
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:24,130
Speaker 1: No, the only reason I disagree with that and I think this is a very pragmatic policy Is that you know what goes on at these cons, you know, what's going to happen?

236
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,445
Speaker 1: No one and also a vuvuzela can play a flat B flat.

237
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:33,444
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I'm gonna make the argument that if you can only play one moat and one note you don't get in.

238
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:37,642
Speaker 0: Oh So any instrument is okay that can play more than one note.

239
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:39,270
Speaker 1: even a snare drums got two notes.

240
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,275
Speaker 0: Are you ready for this rim?

241
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:40,517
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

242
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:42,287
Speaker 0: I'm gonna beat your policy so fast.

243
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:43,716
Speaker 0: All right How do you think I'm gonna do this?

244
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,259
Speaker 0: Can you guess?

245
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,279
Speaker 1: I don't know because I'll just ban Whatever you say I'm banning.

246
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,870
Speaker 0: I'm gonna drill a hole in my vuvuzela.

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,931
Speaker 1: All right You know what if you now place two notes open hole closed hole and then we ban you for being disruptive and that's the end Of that.

248
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:56,614
Speaker 0: that's fine.

249
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still I you know, it's like okay.

250
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:08,525
Speaker 0: pragmatically you got to just ban anyone The yaoi paddle before and that saved us a lot of BS, you know I don't know what the harm is in the actual yaoi paddle hitting each other with them.

251
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:09,792
Speaker 1: It's just mechanism design It's the.

252
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,690
Speaker 0: if anyone hits anyone you should just kick them out and ban them forever.

253
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't know it's it's a younger demographic.

254
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,461
Speaker 1: I was actually I was a little.

255
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,988
Speaker 1: we didn't ban them at Kinetic on.

256
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:24,187
Speaker 0: in fact The penalty should be you get hit but whoa, but I know it's consensual hitting.

257
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:24,790
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

258
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,190
Speaker 1: You know often I was radioing back.

259
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,925
Speaker 1: I'll be like there's a girl dressed like this blue vuvuzela unless you just blew it.

260
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,552
Speaker 1: if you see her blow it anywhere kick Her out.

261
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:32,094
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

262
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:35,230
Speaker 1: I don't know if they actually kicked anyone out, but we kept the vuvuzela under.

263
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:38,641
Speaker 0: There was like a couple of them early on but then they were gone.

264
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:43,576
Speaker 1: But of course we only had you know 7,000 to 8,000 people.

265
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,461
Speaker 0: Okay, so Otakon is like four of those.

266
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,890
Speaker 0: so it's for Kinetic on simultaneously, but also much denser.

267
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:55,181
Speaker 1: I mean even if someone in the middle of a crowd is like vuvuzela By the time you get to them, he's dropped it.

268
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,226
Speaker 1: He's passed it to someone else.

269
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:56,749
Speaker 1: You can't get it.

270
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just a matter of.

271
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:03,279
Speaker 0: there's a conflict between my idealistic You know, this is how it should be done.

272
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,990
Speaker 0: This is what's right and what's practical to be done.

273
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:18,770
Speaker 1: And I I will say this having been the head of panels for Kinetic on this year Practicality will win out every time with me for pretty much the rest of my life Mmm, most of the time in most cases.

274
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:31,050
Speaker 1: So what's scary is that a lot of people like it seems like it's split like 70/30 like 70% of the people out there are like, yes Thank you for banning these god-awful things or people are like I was at anime Expo.

275
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:37,509
Speaker 1: It was I don't want to even remember it, but there's people like a small minority who are really angry about this.

276
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:46,094
Speaker 0: alright, I Mean they got rid of the hug signs and they got rid of oh my god Kinetic on.

277
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:46,959
Speaker 0: well, I don't see.

278
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:51,738
Speaker 0: I can understand right the obvious Prostitution proximity kind of situation.

279
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,669
Speaker 0: but really what is a hugs unless someone is hugging people?

280
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,934
Speaker 0: Unsolicited hugging right?

281
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:58,278
Speaker 0: What is the harm?

282
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:01,987
Speaker 1: I've got in cons ban and because specifically of the legal liability.

283
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,589
Speaker 1: That's the only reason.

284
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:02,970
Speaker 0: that's fine.

285
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have no problem with that.

286
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,550
Speaker 0: But the thing is when people were discussing the hug sign at Kinetic on they were not bringing up that particular reason.

287
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:11,901
Speaker 1: Same thing we're talking about like the meme show.

288
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:15,923
Speaker 0: they were to bring up that reason and say yes There is a legal liability with the hug sign.

289
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:16,949
Speaker 0: I would say fine get rid of it.

290
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:24,516
Speaker 1: But if they say we're banning the hug sign because but note at the Scott the discussion at Kinetic on We don't ban hugs.

291
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:26,965
Speaker 0: I know but there are people who's saying we should.

292
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:28,170
Speaker 1: yeah people in the audience.

293
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,578
Speaker 1: But they they can say what they want.

294
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:30,503
Speaker 1: It's a con feedback.

295
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:37,685
Speaker 0: All right, that's fine Yeah, and but if you say ban it cuz it creeps me out It's like well, should we ban the furry costume because it creeps you out too.

296
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:40,501
Speaker 1: I mean, come on You gotta be pragmatic about it.

297
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,050
Speaker 1: really look at the demographic of the convention.

298
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:48,841
Speaker 1: You look at past behavior like say the hug thing Like we see like demonstrably this hug thing is causing a problem.

299
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,630
Speaker 1: then the next year we can say look look what happened last year.

300
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:52,915
Speaker 1: There's no way out of this.

301
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:53,517
Speaker 1: but to ban it.

302
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:53,938

Speaker 0: exactly Is this gonna sell them any Old Spice, you know, I mean it seems like this is the new thing.

326
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:20,417
Speaker 0: It's gonna definitely has brand awareness if they want people to know what Old Spice is people didn't know if they wanted people to know That Old Spice has body wash.

327
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:20,779
Speaker 0: Guess what?

328
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:22,849
Speaker 0: I know that now I thought it was just deodorant.

329
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,737
Speaker 0: now I know they have body wash.

330
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, am I gonna buy Old Spice body wash?

331
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:27,690
Speaker 0: not a chance in hell.

332
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,625
Speaker 1: Well, the reason I don't is that it smells like old.

333
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,179
Speaker 0: They should make New Spice.

334
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:35,150
Speaker 0: I might at least try it once.

335
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:40,486
Speaker 0: At the very least I would go into the grow to the drugstore open it and take a whiff.

336
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,990
Speaker 1: you do a cross-brand, right?

337
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:50,589
Speaker 1: It's New Spice on the cover Dune Treachery.

338
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:52,336
Speaker 1: They have to have two flavors.

339
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:56,110
Speaker 1: I try new treachery body wash from the makers of spice.

340
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:04,256
Speaker 1: It comes in it comes in sandworm and No amount of advertising over changing me.

341
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:04,677
Speaker 1: I wear.

342
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:12,113
Speaker 1: I don't wear antiperspirant screw that and I just wear basically unscented antibacterial deodorant that Deodorant.

343
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,849
Speaker 0: but it has a scent and I switch between red green and blue.

344
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:21,234
Speaker 0: Mine has a slight scent but is basically the scent of the antibacterial thing is I don't know what the difference is between the red green And blue.

345
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,188
Speaker 0: they're all basically the same.

346
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:23,515
Speaker 1: Is it like diamond?

347
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:27,208
Speaker 0: one of them is like one of them is like Arctic something and the other one is Friday.

348
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,330
Speaker 1: even now I tended to go with the Arctic something because every brain is their Arctic equivalent.

349
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:31,931
Speaker 0: It's a blue one.

350
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,554
Speaker 1: I because that was the least like offensive.

351
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:37,356
Speaker 0: I think one of them is like active sport something which is Whatever.

352
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,809
Speaker 1: I use my adidas.

353
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:48,178
Speaker 0: But yeah I think that you know, I'm still waiting for the time when people figure out that Advertising as a whole is sort of a scam.

354
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:56,570
Speaker 0: right advertising sort of works when you put it on TV because you know It basically hypnotizes and brainwashes stupid people into buying something.

355
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:57,995
Speaker 0: But it's not gonna.

356
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,721
Speaker 0: it doesn't work on internet people.

357
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:01,246
Speaker 0: I want to see statistics.

358
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:02,510
Speaker 1: Do you know you're you're positing?

359
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,723
Speaker 1: I don't disagree with you necessarily, but we don't have data.

360
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,210
Speaker 0: I would be incredibly surprised.

361
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,215
Speaker 0: I want to see data.

362
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:10,989
Speaker 0: show me the sales of old spice.

363
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,933
Speaker 0: now Here's the thing it might be thrown off Right there might.

364
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:18,429
Speaker 0: here are some factors that might make it look like old spice sales increased when they did not ready.

365
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:33,030
Speaker 0: factor number one that might makes old spice look like it's selling more is There's a middleman the drugstore the Duane Reade and they might be convinced because of this campaign that old spice is going to sell More and they might order extra old spice body wash.

366
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I guess I don't know what I guess they do.

367
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,266
Speaker 1: it like the book industry.

368
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:42,170
Speaker 0: there is no evidence We need numbers from the drugstore of how old spice sells through to the customer.

369
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:44,050
Speaker 0: This is actually that happens to comics allies.

370
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:50,230
Speaker 0: If you look at comic sales figures, it tells you how many copies of the book are sold to the comic shop.

371
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,836
Speaker 0: It doesn't tell you how many are sold through.

372
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:54,185
Speaker 1: the same thing happened when you TSR back in the day.

373
00:20:54,226 --> 00:21:00,270
Speaker 1: their D&D books like sold Well for a while and then every bookstore had like one full set of D&D books that never sold again.

374
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,379
Speaker 1: And eventually I got shipped back to TSR.

375
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:03,746
Speaker 0: That's what happened to the anime.

376
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:04,650
Speaker 0: That's happened to the manga.

377
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:12,419
Speaker 0: That's why media play couldn't pay its bills to all the anime companies because they bought put all this anime on the shelf that they didn't Sell through, you know comic books.

378
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,504
Speaker 0: They'll tell you all.

379
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:14,750
Speaker 0: we sold a zillion Batman's.

380
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:27,119
Speaker 0: But then you go to the convention and you see all the quarter bins the 50 cent bins The dollar bins are filled with those issues of Batman booster gold because the comic book store bought too many copies Right, and that is the thing there.

381
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,589
Speaker 0: So that's that's one thing that could throw off the sales.

382
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:36,110
Speaker 1: Our supposition is that this guy has basically sold himself, but not old spice.

383
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:38,757
Speaker 0: This guy is gonna have awesome acting.

384
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:40,883
Speaker 1: I want to get him at a con.

385
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:43,210
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely like magfest or something weird.

386
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:47,846
Speaker 0: Oh, dude at magfest with the Duke Nukem guy, but balls of spice.

387
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:51,807
Speaker 0: Oh my god It would just be epic with the entertainment value.

388
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:54,610
Speaker 0: Oh my god It's like they've done a really good job of making a TV show.

389
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,230
Speaker 0: They've done a really bad job of selling old spice.

390
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,883
Speaker 0: In fact, did you see the reply from this great awesome dude who did?

391
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:01,926
Speaker 0: he was like duff men.

392
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:02,870
Speaker 0: You see that guy?

393
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:03,754
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I didn't.

394
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:05,000
Speaker 0: Oh, man, that guy's awesome.

395
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,004
Speaker 0: You got to check this guy.

396
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:06,768
Speaker 0: I'll check this out.

397
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:07,190
Speaker 0: He's on boy.

398
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,432
Speaker 0: I'll show you when the show is over.

399
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,987
Speaker 1: So right on two things of the day.

400
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:19,870
Speaker 1: I I feel stupid.

401
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:29,449
Speaker 1: I saw this picture the thing that is my thing of the day and I immediately realized that I am not A good problem solver because remember we lived in colony at RIT.

402
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,457
Speaker 1: We had that shitty electric oven.

403
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:35,229
Speaker 1: I think was like the worst oven ever and it was like super uneven.

404
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:55,468
Speaker 1: the my thing of the day is the instructions how to make a map of your broiler and Then you can or even a map of your oven and you can just use this To know where the hot spots and cold spots are in your oven, you know Just take a pan cover it in slices of bread Put it in turn it on wait until like somewhere turns black pull it out take a picture of it.

405
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:59,790
Speaker 0: broiler map Darker is hotter, you know, it would work better if you had one big bread.

406
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:05,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not it was in the crust wouldn't you know, I'm the kind of person who's made one big bread.

407
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:07,217
Speaker 1: I probably already have a good oven.

408
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:10,687
Speaker 0: the other thing this doesn't count for broiling but for baking at least.

409
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:11,690
Speaker 0: I have the baking sheet.

410
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:15,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, really helps out and it's a gas oven that helps out even more.

411
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:16,227
Speaker 0: Anyway, is that it?

412
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:16,648
Speaker 1: That's it.

413
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:17,732
Speaker 1: It's cool I like this.

414
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:18,073
Speaker 1: All

415
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:37,189
Speaker 0: right, I have for you an open letter to the French Parliament originally published in 1845 1845 it is a petition for the manufacturers of candles tapers lanterns sticks street lamps snuffers and extinguishers frontiers and from the producers of tallow oil resin alcohol and generally of everything connected with lighting.

416
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:46,030
Speaker 0: and Basically, this is one of those things from the olden days where you say more shit changes more shit stays the same.

417
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:47,859
Speaker 1: Here's the exact.

418
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,850
Speaker 1: that was the year the rubber band was invented.

419
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:55,469
Speaker 1: What yeah, that was the year the Raven by Edgar Allan Poe was published for the first time.

420
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:56,613
Speaker 1: That was the year at least.

421
00:23:56,774 --> 00:24:02,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically this art this this letter to Parliament talks about, you know, man There's some guys.

422
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:31,849
Speaker 0: they're making candles in another country we under far superior conditions and they're flooding the domestic market with candles at an incredibly low price and it's hurting our business, right and Let's see the rival which is none other than the Sun is waging war on us So mercilessly that we suspect he is being stirred up against us by perfidious Albion Particularly because he has for that haughty island a respect that he does not show for us.

423
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:43,797
Speaker 0: And we ask you to be so good as to pass a law requiring the closing of all windows dormers skylights Inside and outside shutters curtains casements bull's-eyes Deadlights and blinds.

424
00:24:43,897 --> 00:25:00,721
Speaker 0: in short all openings holes chinks and fissures Through which the light of the Sun is want to enter houses to the detriment of the fair industries With which we are proud to say we have endowed the country a country that cannot without betraying and gratitude Abandoned us today to so unequal a combat.

425
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,868
Speaker 0: Wow, and that's just part of this letter.

426
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:04,918
Speaker 0: I How relevant?

427
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:06,245
Speaker 0: is that today to say?

428
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:10,037
Speaker 0: I don't know drms Right and other such things.

429
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:17,640
Speaker 1: I think more to the point is that look at the level of discourse or Outsourcing things to India or China, right?

430
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,330
Speaker 0: This is so incredibly relevant to all these things.

431
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,519
Speaker 0: It's like look, this is the reality of the world.

432
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:32,970
Speaker 0: We shouldn't make laws that Basically illegal eyes the reality of nature and the world except for Vuzela for the benefit of business.

433
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:38,570
Speaker 0: Right, it's like yes, we must outlaw, you know computers have this magical ability, right?

434
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,865
Speaker 0: You know therefore and that is hurting business, which has relied on that ability not existing.

435
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:44,447
Speaker 0: Therefore.

436
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:45,530
Speaker 0: We need to outlaw that.

437
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,449
Speaker 0: It's like if Wizards invented the flying spell.

438
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:52,705
Speaker 0: So in order for the airlines to stay in business, we need to outlaw wizardry.

439
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:53,949
Speaker 0: That's what you know.

440
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,370
Speaker 0: Because copying has now become possible.

441
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:03,530
Speaker 0: We need to outlaw copying so we can continue to sell CDs and DVDs because really that's not working out for us.

442
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,270
Speaker 0: It's the same as this which is let's outlaw the Sun so we can sell more candles, right?

443
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:14,190
Speaker 0: This is obviously a satirical letter, but it applies so well today, you know, how can you ignore me fair?

444
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,873
Speaker 1: You don't know.

445
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:16,178
Speaker 1: you could go back to that day.

446
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:23,910
Speaker 1: That guy has got like cannons pointed like every day He's firing cannons at the Sun getting just that much closer to taking it out once and for all.

447
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:33,900
Speaker 1: uh-huh, so The meta moment that I almost forgot about all right coming up The Otacon is the 30th.

448
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:40,053
Speaker 1: It is this what we are next next weekend Not this weekend not next weekend But the following.

449
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,097
Speaker 0: we just say what date.

450
00:26:41,137 --> 00:26:50,630
Speaker 1: it is July 30th 31st and 1st, but sadly we have announcement We will not be attending Otacon or performing any of our panels this year in any capacity whatsoever, really?

451
00:26:51,191 --> 00:26:56,670
Speaker 1: Sadly, they don't have a panel schedule announced yet And we kind of passed all of our deadlines for setting up our own stuff.

452
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:58,621
Speaker 1: So there's really nothing we can do.

453
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:00,231
Speaker 1: We hope we'll be there at Otacon 2011.

454
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:05,751
Speaker 1: I apologize to all of the listeners who have emailed me or have responded to our Twitter about the fact that we won't be there

455
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:11,273
Speaker 0: or anyone who has gone to Otacon expecting us to be there and you know if we were a factor in your decision to Go,

456
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:20,819
Speaker 1: so I would recommend in the very least You should check out Darryl Sarad will be there doing some panels with the anime world order crew and I'm I'm assuming Mike tool Will be there doing his awesome stuff.

457
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,145
Speaker 1: So go and have fun.

458
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:25,256
Speaker 1: Tell us how it is, but It's basically.

459
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,248
Speaker 1: sadly no one in the front row crew is going to.

460
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:33,070
Speaker 1: Otacon Did independent of us our entire like circle of friends and our staff and everyone's been going every year since 2000.

461
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,619
Speaker 1: They all bailed on us like months ago.

462
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,690
Speaker 1: So Scott and I were gonna be the only ones going anyway.

463
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,356
Speaker 0: So they're pretty much three other.

464
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:44,040
Speaker 0: besides the lateness of the schedule which pretty much sealed us not going There are three other reasons we didn't know about.

465
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,310
Speaker 0: it wasn't until this morning that we had to give up But we would be remiss to not mention all of the four reasons of not going, you know.

466
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,996
Speaker 0: The first reason late schedule right.

467
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:55,850
Speaker 0: reason number two is that we're in New York City and we don't have cars anymore.

468
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:59,190
Speaker 0: So going to Otacon is much more difficult for us than it was in the past.

469
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,817
Speaker 0: I mean if we still had cars or relive closer We may still have gone.

470
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:10,630
Speaker 1: this is part of the part of the reason why we've really moved on to Anime Boston because we cut out, you know anime next and all that because we can just fly there really easily.

471
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:16,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, reason number three is the same reason that our all of our friends have bailed which is not mailing the badges.

472
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:18,175
Speaker 0: still I mean, right.

473
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,421
Speaker 1: There's nothing we can do about that.

474
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:25,685
Speaker 0: And then reason number four is Simply that Otacon isn't really that good to us.

475
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:26,609
Speaker 0: other conventions.

476
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:32,470
Speaker 0: anime Boston gives us hundreds of dollars to go right and they're actually the only ones who pass actual money.

477
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,425
Speaker 0: But you look at Kineticon, you know Kineticon, you know, they they love us.

478
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,910
Speaker 1: They made us the heads of panels.

479
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:41,610
Speaker 1: So right either we did something right or they're setting us up for some horrible fall.

480
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:48,049
Speaker 0: They're gonna murder us, you know packs, you know gives us what we need and it's you know I'm not saying oh you need to kiss our feet to get us to show up.

481
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,584
Speaker 0: You know, not every convention we go helps though when magfest emailed me.

482
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:58,090
Speaker 0: That was a really nice email guys Yeah, you know, I mean, you know, obviously it helps but it's not necessary.

483
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,886
Speaker 0: You know we go into Otacon because we want to entertain the fans of Otacon.

484
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,750
Speaker 0: We don't go for us.

485
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,370
Speaker 0: We go for the people there to bring them a better convention.

486
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:10,444
Speaker 0: But you know, we can't go if you really you need can't?

487
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:12,050
Speaker 0: you know, we're not asking for money.

488
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,981
Speaker 0: That's something anime Boston happens to give us.

489
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,610
Speaker 0: We would still go to anime Boston without it.

490
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,202
Speaker 0: We're not asking for hotels or comps or anything like that.

491
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:24,057
Speaker 0: You know a free badge, I guess might be necessary and Skipping the line is necessary.

492
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:24,520
Speaker 0: But that's right.

493
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,128
Speaker 0: If you give us that we're good, you know.

494
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,249
Speaker 0: But Otacon really they just make it hard for us to go.

495
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:32,688
Speaker 0: It's like they put up blocks in our way.

496
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:35,685
Speaker 1: It mostly just comes down to the scheduling from that and that front.

497
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:36,670
Speaker 1: like for my interactions.

498
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:43,797
Speaker 1: It's the only con where we actually submit panels and then wait for response and then, you know But they won't it, you know all that stuff.

499
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, they just have like a conference call a few months ahead of time.

500
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,913
Speaker 1: We sort it all out.

501
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,681
Speaker 0: They make it difficult for us.

502
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:52,554
Speaker 0: if they would make it easy like New York Anime Festival What do they give us?

503
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,707
Speaker 0: They're not giving us anything except for panels, right?

504
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,009
Speaker 0: That's it.

505
00:29:55,533 --> 00:30:00,530
Speaker 0: They don't give us anything and that golden badge But no, but I mean they give us basically the same thing Otacon gives us.

506
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:06,890
Speaker 0: They don't give us anything different from them except, you know Otacon makes it hard for us to go where New York Anime Festival makes it easy.

507
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:15,530
Speaker 1: one thing with the New York Anime Festival comic-con is that They make it very easy to attend partly due to the fact that the seven train goes almost all the way to the Javits.

508
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:23,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if I lived in in Baltimore or close to it, you know DC I'd probably go to Otacon and not New York Anime Festival because it's the same treatment.

509
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,734
Speaker 0: Well, maybe I would go.

510
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:31,628
Speaker 0: I would probably would have gone this year because the double Megacon Yeah, but I probably never would have gone in the past ever, you know, but that's just how it is.

511
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,700
Speaker 1: Yep So again, we apologize.

512
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:35,210
Speaker 1: I know a lot of you expect us to do panels.

513
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,490
Speaker 1: None of the front row crew are really gonna be there.

514
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:48,667
Speaker 1: So try to bother Dave and Joel and Daryl and Mike tool Pax prime is sold out sold out and is Labor Day weekend.

515
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:52,799
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there doing Seattle doing at least two panels.

516
00:30:52,939 --> 00:31:05,754
Speaker 1: All we can announce right now is we're doing egregiously unrealized potential Which is I like to call it the act eraser panel All right, and we're doing a game mechanics and mechanism design, which is pretty much the hardest core Like all right.

517
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:08,767
Speaker 1: you assholes you want us to talk about the theory straight up.

518
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:09,189
Speaker 1: Let's go.

519
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:12,790
Speaker 0: So this is a this is a game of imperfect information.

520
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna.

521
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:15,036
Speaker 1: we're gonna.

522
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:20,076
Speaker 1: actually, you know, every time we do a panel we're like this is a zero-sum Perfect information.

523
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:22,510
Speaker 1: So game theory blah and then we just talk about games.

524
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,205
Speaker 1: This time we're gonna like game theory blah game theory game theory game theory game theory game.

525
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:36,197
Speaker 0: This is a prisoner's dilemma This is a Nash equilibrium This is a coffee grinder, oh wait Oh That looks like World of Warcraft to me.

526
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,285
Speaker 1: we have a couple other events.

527
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:39,570
Speaker 1: we're gonna be doing big New York.

528
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:46,643
Speaker 0: And if this festival New York Comic Con combo con Friday and Saturday at the New York and invisible comic-con.

529
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:56,370
Speaker 1: We're going to be doing Pretty much as many panels and things that we can't announce yet, dude I need at least like three hours to walk around both of those mega exhibit halls.

530
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:58,468
Speaker 1: Oh, that's all I need, you know.

531
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:03,913
Speaker 1: Well, luckily, hopefully if we do that the screening room thing that we're still sorting out That's easy.

532
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:04,536
Speaker 1: You walk in.

533
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:07,068
Speaker 1: Hey, this is blah blah blah blah five minutes.

534
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:07,590
Speaker 1: You're out of there.

535
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,298
Speaker 1: Now you got two hours to go wander around.

536
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:21,620
Speaker 0: Okay, the only other metas we have are that The the Studio Ghibli movie based on Earthsea which reportedly was okay ish is gonna be in theaters soon Of course, it's limited run, you know, New York City LA whatever.

537
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,206
Speaker 0: We'll probably go see it.

538
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:23,948
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know.

539
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:28,784
Speaker 0: I have some other local New York City events, but they're technology related.

540
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:29,989
Speaker 0: So I'll tell you about them on Monday.

541
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:33,330
Speaker 0: and The book club is the lies of Locke Lamora.

542
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,103
Speaker 0: Maybe the next Thursday episode of the one after that cuz rim actually read.

543
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,605
Speaker 0: you finish it.

544
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,347
Speaker 1: Yeah a while ago.

545
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,534
Speaker 0: Holy crap He actually read the book.

546
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:41,558
Speaker 0: It's a miracle.

547
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:44,446
Speaker 1: You know, I'd finished cosmos way early - no you didn't.

548
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,510
Speaker 0: you said you were still reading it.

549
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:49,009
Speaker 1: I was reading like over parts again to remember like what I liked what to talk about.

550
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:52,464
Speaker 0: Anyway, maybe we'll have book clubs a lot more often if we continue this trend.

551
00:32:52,524 --> 00:32:53,227
Speaker 0: It'll be it'll be good.

552
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,809
Speaker 1: Yeah Have any of you read it yet?

553
00:32:56,732 --> 00:32:58,487
Speaker 0: No, no, maybe not.

554
00:32:58,628 --> 00:32:58,870
Speaker 0: I read.

555
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:01,403
Speaker 0: So we did news thing of the day.

556
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:06,790
Speaker 1: Okay, Connecticut As you know, we've said that we're we are the heads of panels for Connecticut.

557
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:27,470
Speaker 1: We're gonna try to not do talk about meta con stuff in any way until we've talked about the con from the fan perspective because it's very easy for us to talk about cons from this kind of professional staff guest Perspective and It's a stupid review like we went to the New York Anna festival that one year where they even like gave us guest billing and everything.

558
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:29,698
Speaker 1: What kind of review of the con is?

559
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:30,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

560
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,185
Speaker 1: Well, they took us right in.

561
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:32,150
Speaker 1: they gave us free badges.

562
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,036
Speaker 1: They let us do whatever we wanted.

563
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:35,861
Speaker 1: That's not that's not useful to you.

564
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:37,747
Speaker 1: No, it's also kind of dickish.

565
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:58,261
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Connecticut is a. for anyone who doesn't know a lot of our listeners are actually Surprisingly really interested in Connecticut because this year we published the schedule after we'd finished it in our own forum and a lot of people who you know, don't live in the States don't live around here saw it and The response we got from these people was overwhelming it generally.

566
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:59,746
Speaker 1: I'll sum them all up into one sentence.

567
00:34:00,228 --> 00:34:02,080
Speaker 1: Holy shit That con looks awesome.

568
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,490
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean the thing is right, you know, this is basically that you know.

569
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,020
Speaker 0: If I have one thing to say about Connecticut, it's this right.

570
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:13,257
Speaker 0: pretty much most of what we saw was panels Because we were running and doing panels.

571
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:16,489
Speaker 0: That's 90% of my weekend was that I didn't get to play a single board game.

572
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,342
Speaker 0: I bought a board game in my one like 30-minute trip through the dealer's room.

573
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:22,310
Speaker 0: I did not get to play a single game.

574
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,857
Speaker 0: I was very sad I talked to.

575
00:34:24,178 --> 00:34:29,739
Speaker 1: but like Lou all our friends that are like doing stuff at the con We all the only time we saw you going on at all.

576
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:32,469
Speaker 0: I high-fived you go once during that trip to the dealer's room.

577
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,664
Speaker 1: I also high-fived her during my saw a non during his panel.

578
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:37,070
Speaker 0: I think I helped him with some technology.

579
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,514
Speaker 1: I saw you.

580
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:39,389
Speaker 1: I saw the panel getting done and get to stay for it.

581
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:47,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I we saw them at the bar which apparently is the only building that has that is unlocked after midnight In Hartford.

582
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:48,081
Speaker 0: that has food.

583
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:53,630
Speaker 0: that's within walking distance But appetizers only by the time we get there which is fine because I can make a me a lot of appetizers.

584
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,489
Speaker 0: Oh that tostada is pretty good tostada.

585
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,750
Speaker 0: I'm so hungry cuz I didn't eat this morning cuz they told me not to eat after midnight for the doctor.

586
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:02,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like fucking gremlins what the shit.

587
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:07,365
Speaker 1: but basically Connecticut feel like a lot of people think it's an anime con, but it's not.

588
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,310
Speaker 0: I didn't finish what I was saying.

589
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:12,021
Speaker 0: All right Is that the general thing I had to say about Connecticut?

590
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:12,724
Speaker 0: is this right?

591
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:14,050
Speaker 0: is that most cons you go to?

592
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,864
Speaker 0: You don't really get to see every panel right?

593
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:17,910
Speaker 0: it's pretty much impossible.

594
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,950
Speaker 0: You see like a very small sampling relative to the mount on the schedule because I was running panels.

595
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:25,667
Speaker 0: I saw almost every panel for at least a few minutes.

596
00:35:25,728 --> 00:35:37,227
Speaker 0: some of them I ran and some of them I saw the whole thing when we went through the schedule and put smiley faces frowny faces or flat faces or late or you know Notes on every panel after you know reviewing them.

597
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:43,510
Speaker 0: basically I was amazed at the sheer number of like smiley faces which means like fucking awesome.

598
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,870
Speaker 0: We don't give a smiley face if it's just an okay panel.

599
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,575
Speaker 1: No, I mean the just smiley face is like.

600
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:50,464
Speaker 0: that panel was awesome and like exceeded everything.

601
00:35:50,604 --> 00:35:56,810
Speaker 0: like I was like wow smiley face Smiley face again, holy shit I just kept putting smiley face after smiley face.

602
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,593
Speaker 0: It was like epic.

603
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:13,710
Speaker 1: and the con feedback was great because numerous people basically said it was the best like year of panels ever Which it means a lot to us, you know before we'll stop all this meta mostly for the fact that we actually took over the panels department halfway through the year and Totally had to like wing it and throw everything at their last minute.

604
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,783
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know what to think about the feedback panel though because they were like.

605
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:18,570
Speaker 0: most of the comments were about panels.

606
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:20,970
Speaker 0: They weren't really that many actually the rest of the staff.

607
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,412
Speaker 1: I sent my.

608
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:28,565
Speaker 1: I had my report of like the panels department and they basically said yeah I remember how last year you guys schedule the panels feedback separate from the con feedback.

609
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:30,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to do that again Really?

610
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:35,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean there was almost no Feedback for anything else but panels.

611
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:39,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm wondering is that because we failed so hard?

612
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,360
Speaker 0: All the complaints were about us because that could be true.

613
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,670
Speaker 0: It could also be true in a complaint.

614
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:49,109
Speaker 1: Well, they said some complaints but one guy didn't like one panel he went to and one girl.

615
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:56,067
Speaker 0: But I mean, it's like is every other part of the convention just so perfect that there's no complaints?

616
00:36:56,208 --> 00:37:00,911
Speaker 0: or is it so Tame that there's nothing to say good or bad, you know Is it?

617
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,647
Speaker 0: is it good or bad that there most of the feedback was for us?

618
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:05,654
Speaker 1: I can say that I don't know.

619
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:06,642
Speaker 1: I want to get out of the meta.

620
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:07,650
Speaker 1: We keep pulling back to the mat.

621
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,578
Speaker 1: I had the radio on a lot longer than you did cuz I the earpiece So I listened to like the radio.

622
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:14,696
Speaker 0: I had the radio on even when it wasn't on my ear But I just had it.

623
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:22,230
Speaker 1: you only had it Saturday and parts of Friday and then Sunday I had it, you know all day Friday and It seems like the staff were good enough at any time.

624
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,045
Speaker 1: There was an issue like jumping on it and fixing it before most attendees noticed that.

625
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:28,683
Speaker 1: I think that goes a long way To the lack of negative feedback.

626
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:31,839
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Also line mail anyway skipping all the meta stuff.

627
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,067
Speaker 1: Connecticut is a con about everything.

628
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:37,670
Speaker 1: our goal At least us for panels is one-third anime stuff.

629
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:42,530
Speaker 1: You know anime manga comics all that sort of that like genre slash medium of stuff.

630
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,781
Speaker 0: You got to get the webcomics.

631
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,649
Speaker 0: You got to get the sci-fi.

632
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,796
Speaker 0: You got to get the fantasy.

633
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:47,043
Speaker 0: you got to get the arts and crafts.

634
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,270
Speaker 0: You got to get the technology.

635
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,575
Speaker 0: You got to get the gaming.

636
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:52,427
Speaker 0: you got to get the tabletop and the video and the miniatures and the.

637
00:37:52,969 --> 00:38:00,270
Speaker 0: you know other geeky things in there like the airsoft and the paintball and you know anything that is nerdy in any way.

638
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:07,270
Speaker 0: You know the parkour and the para para and the belly dancing and the hypnotism guy and pretty much cosplay.

639
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:08,920
Speaker 0: Anything that's geeky.

640
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,530
Speaker 0: that is falls in our realm.

641
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:12,349
Speaker 0: We're gonna try to get it in there somewhere.

642
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:15,606
Speaker 1: So imagine a con that a third of the attendees are like Otakon or anime.

643
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,596
Speaker 1: Boston attendees You know cosplayers running around yelling having a good time.

644
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:25,421
Speaker 1: a third are gamers the same people who go to packs and a third are Just like everybody else.

645
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:26,810
Speaker 1: old ladies mothers.

646
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,134
Speaker 1: We had a whole family.

647
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:36,818
Speaker 1: the mother the father and the son all did panels and all of them were like grade-a panels Mm-hmm the family the geeks together.

648
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:37,159
Speaker 0: Yeah.

649
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, they geeked together a lot.

650
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:41,958
Speaker 0: They play saw them playing a spooky manner Spooky manner.

651
00:38:41,978 --> 00:38:42,846
Speaker 0: they were quite good at that.

652
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:52,353
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know and the thing is no one Daryl Sarai You can't complain because you know it says right there on the cover of the con book kinetic on everything But the kitchen sink.

653
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:53,659
Speaker 0: it is an everything con.

654
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:57,212
Speaker 0: It does not advertise itself as any specific thing Right.

655
00:38:57,514 --> 00:39:00,470
Speaker 0: Therefore it is okay for us to do everything and we will do everything.

656
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,470
Speaker 0: We want to get all the nerds, you know, cuz Connecticut isn't really the most populous state.

657
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,609
Speaker 0: It's spread out big houses lots of trees and most of it, right?

658
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,727
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's not.

659
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:19,090
Speaker 0: I mean There's a lot of geeks up there who are underserved and we want to serve all the geeks in that area because it's not like There's any you know in order to serve, you know, we want to get the convention be bigger.

660
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:22,103
Speaker 0: But if we just had just anime we wouldn't get as many people.

661
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:23,730
Speaker 0: if you're just gaming wouldn't get as many people.

662
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,477
Speaker 0: But we get them all together which we can do.

663
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:33,193
Speaker 0: we can get all those geeks together and because a lot of people have Crossover interest we are serving a greater population and a greater You know need.

664
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,385
Speaker 0: but the bigger con and that's that's the the way kinetic on should be.

665
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:43,270
Speaker 1: the other thing that helped out a lot And that we do is we have workshop rooms and we filled them with like just straight-up workshops.

666
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,258
Speaker 1: I mean, there's this plushy building workshop.

667
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:46,282
Speaker 1: That's just amazing.

668
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,145
Speaker 0: I think that was the same one.

669
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,290
Speaker 0: That was an anime Boston.

670
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:54,710
Speaker 1: I think it was if I'm correct and like a sculpting one a whole bunch of art panels ball Joanna dolls a bunch of jewelry making panels.

671
00:39:55,312 --> 00:40:00,427
Speaker 1: We had a knitting workshop that the popularity of that surprised us immensely.

672
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:05,116
Speaker 0: almost every workshop I went to peek in on even like writing workshops basically almost all.

673
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:11,699
Speaker 0: if they were in the small room and there was actual arts and crafts involved full and The big room like almost all of them just filled the big room.

674
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,485
Speaker 0: The origami one was insane.

675
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:15,030
Speaker 0: It actually went over time.

676
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,000
Speaker 0: I had to be like, alright guys, look you gotta get out.

677
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,770
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's enough origami.

678
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:26,809
Speaker 0: Yep, we had to go downstairs in Russian like take the cons paper from the printer and you know Bring it up there so more people could do origami.

679
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:34,836
Speaker 1: But like for an example, like we had a panel on Japanese tea ceremony Oh beer works and Walt Disney the American tezukas How to not suck at GMing.

680
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:35,459
Speaker 1: that wasn't us.

681
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,724
Speaker 1: That's the Albany School of GMing.

682
00:40:36,744 --> 00:40:38,330
Speaker 1: those guys kick fucking ass.

683
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,457
Speaker 1: Yep, we had a kendo workshop.

684
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,324
Speaker 1: We had a million like steampunk panels.

685
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:42,785
Speaker 1: They were awesome.

686
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:44,150
Speaker 1: We had one beyond Victoriana.

687
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,520
Speaker 0: This was that panel is so awesome.

688
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:46,901
Speaker 1: That's.

689
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:48,949
Speaker 1: we got to bring that back and put it in like a bigger room.

690
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:51,600
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, basically that panel needs a different name.

691
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,804
Speaker 0: I didn't know what it was till I saw.

692
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,290
Speaker 1: so steampunk's really popular, right?

693
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:54,732
Speaker 1: It's good thing.

694
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:55,617
Speaker 1: It didn't have a different name.

695
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:57,126
Speaker 1: cuz that room we had a line out the door.

696
00:40:57,146 --> 00:40:59,194
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It was about steampunk.

697
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,662
Speaker 1: That's anything but like Victorian Europe.

698
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:02,645
Speaker 0: Yeah notice.

699
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:04,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never really thought about it.

700
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,010
Speaker 0: But all steampunk is basically Victorian plus gears and brass, right?

701
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:09,733
Speaker 0: It's like.

702
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:14,148
Speaker 0: why not have like, you know Native American steampunk or some Russian.

703
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:28,981
Speaker 0: see, you know there's so many other nationalities and time periods and thing, you know You could even do Star Wars steampunk or you could take your steampunk with anything but Victorian England and it could be awesome You know, you could do it with 1700s US steampunk.

704
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:31,088
Speaker 0: It'd be a little different from the Victorian England, right?

705
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:34,278
Speaker 0: So She was like why not do something different?

706
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:36,024
Speaker 0: and it was totally totally sweet.

707
00:41:36,185 --> 00:41:37,650
Speaker 0: That was like genius that panel.

708
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:43,446
Speaker 1: Yep, we had like a cell painting workshop an old-school inking one a Japanese woodblock workshop.

709
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:46,738
Speaker 0: That was frickin boss, man I wanted to go to that if I couldn't go to that.

710
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:47,702
Speaker 1: I know I went

711
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:52,509
Speaker 0: over to it thinking I'm gonna make a woodblock print, but then it was full already

712
00:41:53,513 --> 00:42:02,230
Speaker 1: Next year, you know the one thing we you know We kind of rush this is that my philosophy for running conventions at this point forward is it's always dictate delegate or do-it-yourself.

713
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:04,686
Speaker 1: That's right, and I'm delegating a lot.

714
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:07,357
Speaker 0: We did not delegate nearly enough pretty much.

715
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:11,993
Speaker 0: whenever something came through I would most of the time just go and try to take care Of it.

716
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:18,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I would oh I would you know I would only delegate like if I was pretty sure someone was not doing something already.

717
00:42:18,851 --> 00:42:24,281
Speaker 1: We had a bunch of guy panels a bunch of you know Meet-and-greets for all these webcomic artists and all the guests we had.

718
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:26,630
Speaker 1: we had our first like a Japanese guest of mineral.

719
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:29,162
Speaker 1: Oh, no, he is a a producer of anime.

720
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,046
Speaker 1: He's an awesome guy.

721
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:37,397
Speaker 1: as a professor and Him and as I was since they came and did like this awesome panel on kawaii, you know, like cute culture Yeah, and you know, it's great.

722
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,210
Speaker 0: You know, it really surprised me though, right?

723
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:46,117
Speaker 0: I mean I guess it helped that we pimped the panel and tried to tell people to go to it right during our very popular panel that The anime you should see.

724
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:46,641
Speaker 1: that was very.

725
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:47,830
Speaker 0: that was very convincing.

726
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:54,690
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know friggin Nobru Ishiguro like huge dudes at anime con like guys who made macross and crap.

727
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,863
Speaker 0: You know huge Japanese anime producers have trouble filling the room.

728
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:04,000
Speaker 0: Fred show has trouble filling the room at Otakon at Kinetic on little convention.

729
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,585
Speaker 0: That is not just an anime con.

730
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:09,558
Speaker 1: that includes many other things We had like seventy five hundred or so people.

731
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:16,956
Speaker 0: this guy is in basically the same size room that they have at Otakon for the small panel room right and He's from Japan.

732
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:22,797
Speaker 0: He's doing a panel on kawaii and anime culture friggin packed Like we had to close the door.

733
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,025
Speaker 0: No, no more permitting.

734
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,450
Speaker 0: That was that was amazing.

735
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:28,521
Speaker 1: I was so pleased with that.

736
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,350
Speaker 1: That was great and they had such a good time.

737
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,300
Speaker 1: They came to a bunch of our panels - that was cool.

738
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,170
Speaker 0: speaking of full rooms, right?

739
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,510
Speaker 0: Two points to the fire marshals, right?

740
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:40,397
Speaker 0: Do you remember my story of PAX East?

741
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,930
Speaker 0: the Boston fire marshal was the awesomest, dude.

742
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:50,810
Speaker 0: He was this short jolly fat dude with a big ol mustache and he was like so fucking awesome.

743
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,249
Speaker 0: I was like, oh my god, you were the best fire marshal, right?

744
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,740
Speaker 0: The the fire marshal who came to Kinetic on right?

745
00:43:57,382 --> 00:44:00,997
Speaker 0: I was like he came down walking down the hall And I'm like, hey the fire marshal.

746
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:03,690
Speaker 0: He's like, no, it's a costume and he keeps going.

747
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:07,981
Speaker 0: He was that was like the best fire marshals.

748
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,210
Speaker 0: I think in order to be fire marshal like to get the job.

749
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,809
Speaker 0: It's like job requirement number one be an awesome, dude.

750
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:14,936
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

751
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:17,270
Speaker 0: I don't even know if I could get that job because I'm not awesome enough.

752
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:19,922
Speaker 0: Maybe I should just quit and try to become a fire marshal.

753
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:21,530
Speaker 0: That's a full-time job, right?

754
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,841
Speaker 1: I think you got to be a fireman first But fireman is a volunteer job.

755
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,310
Speaker 1: You got to be able to do a push-up Scott.

756
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:31,170
Speaker 0: But the thing is being a fireman is a volunteer job, but not in New York City.

757
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,680
Speaker 0: It's a. it's an actual job job also in Detroit.

758
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,604
Speaker 1: My dad's a fireman.

759
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I can't get that job I was a fireman.

760
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:45,707
Speaker 1: I don't I think it's too late for me to get that job But like so I'll get all these crazy panels like anime video games everything all over the place even like the cost.

761
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,434
Speaker 0: not every panel Was awesome.

762
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:48,580
Speaker 0: I mean there were some panels.

763
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,349
Speaker 0: I personally did not enjoy that were full.

764
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:58,290
Speaker 0: There were some panels that seemed like they were good in material, but were empty And then part of that was like well it was scheduled at 9 a.m So we're trying to normal.

765
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, we definitely normalize but you know there were.

766
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:06,883
Speaker 0: not every panel was perfect, but there was a Overwhelming number of smiley faces to the point at which I was amazed.

767
00:45:07,264 --> 00:45:10,042
Speaker 1: and one thing we did that was new this year And we got some good feedback about it.

768
00:45:10,062 --> 00:45:10,788
Speaker 1: So it was a test.

769
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:15,862
Speaker 1: We're gonna do it like crazy next year is Instead of just like some guests just like have their own panels like.

770
00:45:15,902 --> 00:45:17,750
Speaker 1: I got this panel and they just do it and it's awesome.

771
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,990
Speaker 1: Some guests like they have a lot to say but they don't really know what to do at a con.

772
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,590
Speaker 1: So we set up all these round tables.

773
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,772
Speaker 1: We're get some guests and one of us and one of our staff come into the room and moderate a topic Like.

774
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:31,780
Speaker 1: I think the best example of this was on Sunday.

775
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,250
Speaker 1: We had one copyright remixing and moral rights.

776
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:35,569
Speaker 0: Did we actually make that happen?

777
00:45:36,011 --> 00:45:39,749
Speaker 0: I know that we had like a webcomics TBA and I managed to get a webcomic in there.

778
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,103
Speaker 0: Did the secret webcomic panel actually happen?

779
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:42,927
Speaker 1: I got something in there.

780
00:45:42,967 --> 00:45:43,350
Speaker 1: it happened.

781
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:47,110
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz it's like we had some TBA slots because you know, we didn't have the whole year.

782
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,243
Speaker 0: We needed to plan and we didn't get the guest panels until too late.

783
00:45:50,263 --> 00:45:55,204
Speaker 1: We're forcing them to get those much earlier Yep, but now the copyright remixing thing went really really well.

784
00:45:55,224 --> 00:45:58,843
Speaker 1: the crowd loved it and you know, what's weird No one in the room had ever heard of the Creative Commons.

785
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:02,478
Speaker 1: Why and There were some inspired people in that room.

786
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:04,023
Speaker 0: We got to do something about that.

787
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:05,126
Speaker 0: Yeah next year.

788
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:05,889
Speaker 0: I'm doing it.

789
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:14,020
Speaker 1: So panels aside, I mean the con went off as far as I can tell without a hitch The the reg line was actually really reasonable.

790
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,190
Speaker 1: I still I walking out of town to mail the badges.

791
00:46:16,653 --> 00:46:19,269
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think you know, they're not at the point where they need to.

792
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,249
Speaker 0: yeah They don't need to mail the badges.

793
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:23,919
Speaker 0: It never hurts to mail the badges.

794
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:25,284
Speaker 0: you have one pre-reg.

795
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:26,910
Speaker 0: you should mail that motherfucker, right?

796
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,030
Speaker 0: But they have this system where you go up to the these netbooks.

797
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:36,500
Speaker 0: They got really cheap and you go and you type your information in and then you go to the desk and pay and get a Badge and it's you know, it works.

798
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:37,869
Speaker 0: The line is never really that long.

799
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:47,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, the line kind of breezes through but part of it What helps is that it's a con where a lot of people show up on Friday But a lot of people only show up on Saturday and a lot of people only show up on.

800
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,902
Speaker 0: I mean if you live in the area, I mean some people.

801
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:53,457
Speaker 0: they might not be interested in the whole kit everything But the kitchen sink.

802
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,770
Speaker 0: they might just want to play some board games.

803
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:58,846
Speaker 0: Why not just come Saturday play board games for eight hours and leave?

804
00:46:58,866 --> 00:46:59,770
Speaker 0: there's nothing wrong with that here.

805
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:04,208
Speaker 1: Let's talk briefly about all the areas of kinetic on video games like any other gaming con like it.

806
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:04,590
Speaker 1: just it's fine.

807
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:09,010
Speaker 0: They have a partnership with Best Buy that brings over a bunch of stuff and I learned some interesting things about that.

808
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:10,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really want to talk.

809
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm stopped - they have a DDR machine.

810
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:15,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've stuck in there for like one minute and play DDR.

811
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,939
Speaker 0: They have a dealer's room which is actually pretty good.

812
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:18,802
Speaker 1: It's pretty eclectic.

813
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,324
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

814
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:20,890
Speaker 0: Um, they have an artist alley.

815
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:22,121
Speaker 0: It's actually artist colony.

816
00:47:22,182 --> 00:47:22,868
Speaker 0: I think yeah.

817
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,535
Speaker 1: Well one thing I want to point out.

818
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:26,322
Speaker 1: they have a tabletop gaming area.

819
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:32,244
Speaker 1: the tabletop gaming content It's at a con is better than the majority of gaming only cons.

820
00:47:32,324 --> 00:47:33,990
Speaker 0: I've ever been to it's you know what?

821
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,954
Speaker 0: It's better than the table.

822
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:36,581
Speaker 0: It's better than the board gaming impacts.

823
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:37,244
Speaker 0: It is.

824
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:45,850
Speaker 0: Yeah straight up straight up It is it is the best, you know, I've never been to a Gen Con or origins or anything But I have confidence in what I know about those conventions.

825
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,241
Speaker 0: Kineticon might be the best tabletop gaming at a convention.

826
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:52,397
Speaker 0: I know if now there is a board game geek con I do I. I don't.

827
00:47:52,518 --> 00:47:53,485
Speaker 0: I want to leave that one out.

828
00:47:53,545 --> 00:47:53,908
Speaker 0: I don't know.

829
00:47:55,512 --> 00:48:07,379
Speaker 0: I can guess it might be better there but kineticon has the best tabletop board gaming of any con I have been to and the role-playing is nothing to sneeze at - we got Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson in and They rocked it.

830
00:48:07,419 --> 00:48:08,449
Speaker 1: They did all their panels.

831
00:48:08,911 --> 00:48:12,504
Speaker 1: Jared did action castle spooky Manor and jungle event Luke Crane.

832
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:14,290
Speaker 0: They were they had this character burning workshop.

833
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:15,690
Speaker 0: They showed up to it, right?

834
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,649
Speaker 0: I remember like why and Pete did it last.

835
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:19,177
Speaker 1: yeah I remember how crazy popular it was.

836
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:21,950
Speaker 0: and Luke shows up and he's like, how am I supposed to do this?

837
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,208
Speaker 0: What the hell did Pete do?

838
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:28,510
Speaker 0: He's like, how did they do this last year, but he just started doing it and it was really awesome.

839
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:32,609
Speaker 0: And we made this crazy dwarf who is an arbal Esther twice and then became a drunk.

840
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:36,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know people were like, whoa I have to get this game.

841
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:37,439
Speaker 0: and Luke like.

842
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,598
Speaker 0: he figured it out as he was going through and I was like, dude You don't need to do the skills.

843
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:41,649
Speaker 0: He's like I want to do the skills.

844
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:46,969
Speaker 0: So we did this, you know and I have the character on Google Docs or whatever.

845
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:52,153
Speaker 0: So yeah that you know, even that went well something he didn't even know what to do walking into it But then he did it.

846
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:55,410
Speaker 1: and one thing too that works for kineticon is they've due to location.

847
00:48:55,491 --> 00:49:02,450
Speaker 1: We get the Hartford Convention Center every year Which used to be way bigger than we needed and we're growing into it to the point that we're gonna fill it up someday.

848
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:05,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're actually you know, we're using almost all of it right?

849
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:06,610
Speaker 0: what part are we not using?

850
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:08,881
Speaker 1: Well, we can't that the middle parts hard to use.

851
00:49:09,102 --> 00:49:14,363
Speaker 1: at most we can put up stuff in there But there's no room that's big enough for panels that we would save.

852
00:49:14,443 --> 00:49:16,190
Speaker 0: there did used to be that conference room.

853
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:16,917
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's still.

854
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:17,462
Speaker 0: it's still there.

855
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:18,370
Speaker 0: It didn't used to be there.

856
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,309
Speaker 1: I want to see if we can get some of those little conference room.

857
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, why can't we we need?

858
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:23,670
Speaker 0: why can't we get that conference room with the big table?

859
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,410
Speaker 0: Remember they used it like lat, you know a few years ago.

860
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:32,650
Speaker 1: What if we got all those office rooms in the esplanade level and made those the individual rooms for scheduled RPGs?

861
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:35,870
Speaker 0: And now the RPG rooms are fine.

862
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:42,901
Speaker 1: If we need more RPGs or then we could cut down one of the RPG rooms in the main area Get another workshop room because we're already out of room for workshops.

863
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,905
Speaker 0: That's all right.

864
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:44,688
Speaker 0: The workshops are cool.

865
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:44,989
Speaker 0: We're there.

866
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see we're good.

867
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,345
Speaker 1: Well, we got not talk about meta stuff, but I don't know.

868
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:49,450
Speaker 1: everyone seemed to have a great time.

869
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,070
Speaker 1: Vuvuzela's were a little bit of a problem, but we finish going through every area.

870
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:59,090
Speaker 0: Oh, there's the ballroom where the dance is that it all switches in the hotel, but it's not like anime.

871
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:01,819
Speaker 0: Next we have to walk from building to building.

872
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:02,883
Speaker 0: It's like right there.

873
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:04,389
Speaker 0: They're basically attached, right?

874
00:50:05,312 --> 00:50:08,048
Speaker 0: there's also some showing rooms over there and an all-night gaming room.

875
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:10,695
Speaker 0: and What else is there?

876
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:14,310
Speaker 1: we put a bunch of stuff over there like the weapons check and the cosplay stuff.

877
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,537
Speaker 0: There's a there's concession stand.

878
00:50:16,898 --> 00:50:19,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, that helps but it's necessary and the prices are reasonable.

879
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:20,537
Speaker 1: It's not like.

880
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:30,281
Speaker 0: it's not like it's a good price But it's more reasonable than other cons like a few bucks less and it's not amazing food But it's better like a food icon like Otakon, you know, forget the inside.

881
00:50:30,342 --> 00:50:30,903
Speaker 1: Nobody.

882
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:33,170
Speaker 0: Nobody should buy the at-con food.

883
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,170
Speaker 1: No, it's a lot cheaper than it used to be but there's restaurants like all over the place.

884
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,438
Speaker 1: You don't have to worry about it Hartford There is nowhere to eat.

885
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:41,085
Speaker 0: do not eat the at-con food.

886
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:44,864
Speaker 0: at most pretty much any convention But a kinetic on you can eat the at-con food.

887
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:45,447
Speaker 0: It's a little bit.

888
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:50,161
Speaker 0: It's okay It's a buck less and it's like plus Tastes a buck better and it costs a buck less.

889
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,010
Speaker 1: in their infinite wisdom this convention center.

890
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,719
Speaker 1: There's an ice cream stand on the first floor.

891
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:56,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get soft-serve for like what?

892
00:50:56,646 --> 00:50:57,288
Speaker 0: two or three dollars?

893
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,620
Speaker 1: Oh my god I stopped there like ten times ten times.

894
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:01,503
Speaker 1: I was yelling.

895
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:02,446
Speaker 1: I was doing pan.

896
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:03,450
Speaker 0: I only went there one day.

897
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:08,390
Speaker 1: I was also running around just shot swapping microphones in rooms because we didn't get enough microphones.

898
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,217
Speaker 1: I'm bringing our microphones next year to supplement.

899
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:19,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was definitely some technical, you know, basically they get the technology They have this company, you know most conventions like when you go to the Javits They pay the Javits because they have to to do it.

900
00:51:19,363 --> 00:51:20,430
Speaker 0: and those guys they're awesome.

901
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:22,419
Speaker 0: They're actually good, you know, even though they're a union.

902
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:23,986
Speaker 0: Those are high quality guys still prefer.

903
00:51:24,006 --> 00:51:30,270
Speaker 1: They're probably way We got probably the best guy got this one awesome, dude, and he just deals with he's kinetic on staff.

904
00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:38,370
Speaker 0: Yeah and what they do is they rent all this equipment from this company for like You know the lowest bid or whatever and they just drop off the equipment on Thursday or early Friday.

905
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:43,590
Speaker 0: They set it up and that's it and it's up to kinetic on to use the equipment which gives us the freedom we need.

906
00:51:43,992 --> 00:51:47,770
Speaker 0: But at the same time it's kind of a pain when we need some more equipment.

907
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:56,750
Speaker 0: Like we only had enough equipment to hook up like three laptops to put you know with audio to put we could hook up video No problem in every room, but the audio not so much.

908
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:05,410
Speaker 0: So if someone needed, you know audio with their PowerPoint or something like that We and enough people wanted it at the same time is problematic.

909
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:09,410
Speaker 0: And if they wanted it in a different room, that means we had to run around and move a bunch of wires.

910
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:10,436
Speaker 1: I guess we're back to meta.

911
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:11,946
Speaker 1: So yeah, Steve Jobs.

912
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:15,680
Speaker 1: Fuck you Did did the biggest I'd say the biggest problem.

913
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,971
Speaker 1: we dealt with this entire con since we were just talking about office staff at this Point.

914
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,790
Speaker 1: there's people who have Mac laptops and don't have the little adapter to plug into a proper projector.

915
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:27,405
Speaker 1: I mean, you're never gonna go to a con but a VGA is a DVR.

916
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:30,116
Speaker 0: PGA is so ugly We can't put that in our MacBook.

917
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:30,719
Speaker 1: fine.

918
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:33,410
Speaker 1: No, the thing is part of it is honestly the panels and the attendees.

919
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,895
Speaker 1: They should bring that little adapter.

920
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:38,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we should just basically be like, well you forgot the adapter.

921
00:52:38,245 --> 00:52:39,950
Speaker 0: That's you know, whatever.

922
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:41,747
Speaker 1: But instead we managed.

923
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:45,016
Speaker 1: Well, I let my laptop to a couple of panelists.

924
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:45,658
Speaker 0: Yep.

925
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,910
Speaker 0: Is there anything else about the con that we can discuss?

926
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,053
Speaker 0: Oh, they had this main events.

927
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:55,530
Speaker 1: We forgot to say that main events is actually like super well put together.

928
00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:02,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's crazy because they actually they pretty much have a main event in there at all hours almost right and I mean obviously not overnight.

929
00:53:02,113 --> 00:53:09,770
Speaker 1: yeah, like here's an example last year we bought super art fight in for the first time and They could have filled probably all the panel room simultaneously.

930
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:14,270
Speaker 1: Mmm, so this year we put him in main events and they rocked it.

931
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,610
Speaker 0: They didn't fill the main events, but they had no main event.

932
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,032
Speaker 0: They had.

933
00:53:17,273 --> 00:53:18,842
Speaker 0: people have filled made the masquerade fills.

934
00:53:18,882 --> 00:53:19,606
Speaker 1: it actually didn't.

935
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:21,072
Speaker 1: there was room Really?

936
00:53:21,113 --> 00:53:22,939
Speaker 1: It just barely like the whole line getting.

937
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,690
Speaker 1: but you know, why all the panel rooms during the masquerade?

938
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:28,360
Speaker 1: We're mostly filling up - yeah, that's right.

939
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,010
Speaker 0: There were quite a few panels during the masquerades.

940
00:53:31,372 --> 00:53:35,230
Speaker 1: We put a lot of really good panels directly opposite the masquerade on purpose.

941
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:43,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually even ran that Hudson Amico panel started as the masquerade theoretically ended even though the masquerade went late And I thought there's gonna be like five people there.

942
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:47,470
Speaker 0: I just wanted to practice this panel see if it worked and the people showed up.

943
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:52,049
Speaker 0: There was like 20 people in there out in a tiny panel room late at night and I was like damn look at this.

944
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:53,819
Speaker 0: Actually had to do it for reals.

945
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to bring that guy to.

946
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:57,455
Speaker 0: you know Some anime Boston and such.

947
00:53:57,876 --> 00:54:07,115
Speaker 1: it says something that this con like going to Connecticut despite the fact that we basically worked for the entire Con was super fun Like it was crazy fun and all you know We've got a lot of for most

948
00:54:07,136 --> 00:54:07,558
Speaker 0: of the time

949
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:19,105
Speaker 1: who had never come to Connecticut before but they normally would go to like Otacon anime Boston like all the kind of cons that they go to and The universal sentiment among them was Wow Connecticut is nothing like I expected it to be.

950
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:21,359
Speaker 1: It's awesome It's the.

951
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,470
Speaker 1: it's my favorite con.

952
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:30,476
Speaker 0: Yeah The location is kind of Blair but because the board gaming is the best Because we actually have staff stuff to do We're never bored right?

953
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:33,550
Speaker 0: and the panels there's just so many awesome ones.

954
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:39,170
Speaker 1: It's like why I still I want to fly Daryl Surratt out if I ever could I would love for him to do his panels.

955
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:39,677
Speaker 0: We got it.

956
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:40,710
Speaker 0: We got to get him there.

957
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:47,046
Speaker 0: Maybe well, you know bring we got to bring up because if we get him in there to replace all the frowny face panels He would just be so epic.

958
00:54:47,126 --> 00:54:49,479
Speaker 1: Oh my god If there's all smiley face panels.

959
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:52,433
Speaker 1: all right legend of Krauser animes craziest I mean.

960
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:58,690
Speaker 0: imagine if you went to a convention and at any given moment There are two or three panels running simultaneously because we staggered the schedule.

961
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:04,945
Speaker 0: so there's breaks in every room right and Every single one of those panels is so sweet and you can't go to all of them.

962
00:55:05,346 --> 00:55:06,210
Speaker 0: What do you do?

963
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,626
Speaker 0: It's like oh my gosh.

964
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:17,090
Speaker 0: Now the only thing I would like to change is we had a few people that did so many panels Which is part of the reason there were so many smiley faces right up like those steampunk dudes did so many.

965
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:18,601
Speaker 1: Oh my god, the family there's like.

966
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:19,890
Speaker 1: there's all this group stuff.

967
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,921
Speaker 1: So I'm not like the penny dreadfuls SS Icarus all those guys whisper.

968
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:31,148
Speaker 1: They the Albany School GM and guys Yeah, all we had all these like groups of people and their pant like they were so professional and so organized like us.

969
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:35,423
Speaker 1: had we Died before kinetic on and we're not there for staff.

970
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:37,510
Speaker 1: a lot of the like normal panels might add some trouble.

971
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:43,370
Speaker 1: These guys would have showed up gotten badges somehow done all their panels and left and they would have no trouble.

972
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:47,225
Speaker 0: They could have taken over the panel's department for us if they wanted to.

973
00:55:47,968 --> 00:55:49,196
Speaker 0: in fact You know what happened.

974
00:55:49,257 --> 00:55:50,829
Speaker 0: a lot like two or three times.

975
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:58,378
Speaker 0: Panelists didn't show up and someone just stood up and tried to do the panel and I was like Whenever that happened whenever that happened.

976
00:55:58,418 --> 00:56:01,026
Speaker 0: I made sure to like tell the people that did that like.

977
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,270
Speaker 0: look email me.

978
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,777
Speaker 0: Hey seriously tell me that you took over this panel.

979
00:56:04,797 --> 00:56:05,580
Speaker 0: like one example.

980
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:11,729
Speaker 0: you are on the good list with a few panels who would show up a Little bit late and I always felt bad when that happened because it's like.

981
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,850
Speaker 0: well I went up there and I was like look the panelist is late.

982
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:17,230
Speaker 0: We are not going to schedule a replacement panel.

983
00:56:17,655 --> 00:56:23,710
Speaker 1: They may yet show up But I cannot guarantee they always showed up a few minutes later and had a good excuse like I was in the bathroom.

984
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I would say look if they you know, I can't promise that you should stay here.

985
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:29,115
Speaker 0: You might be wasting your time I don't know.

986
00:56:29,216 --> 00:56:36,203
Speaker 0: and then when I said when I made that Announcement most of the people would leave and then a few minutes later the person would show up and I'd be like ah I just I destroyed your audience.

987
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:49,507
Speaker 0: I'm sorry In checking every room Yeah after the second time that happened and I destroyed someone's audience I basically the third time I was like look the last time I made this announcement the panelists showed up five minutes later.

988
00:56:50,148 --> 00:56:54,444
Speaker 0: So You know, I don't want to destroy the audience for this person if they show up.

989
00:56:55,187 --> 00:56:57,878
Speaker 0: and you know I making that announcement everything worked out.

990
00:56:57,938 --> 00:57:02,217
Speaker 1: Okay, so I you know, we're talking about people taking over panels Like we got to tell.

991
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,369
Speaker 1: you know, because we basically meted this whole thing.

992
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:09,830
Speaker 1: So I got some amusing anecdotes I guess from Connecticut not waking up on time on Saturday.

993
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:12,968
Speaker 1: So backstories many of you know, but we have a lot of new listeners.

994
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:15,337
Speaker 1: in 2002 there was no geek nights.

995
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:17,324
Speaker 1: yet me and Scott is two slubs.

996
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:19,030
Speaker 1: go to our first anime con ever.

997
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,779
Speaker 1: It's Ohio con in Ohio.

998
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:22,970
Speaker 0: that con was so bad looking like a worse con.

999
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:24,474
Speaker 1: Ohio con.

1000
00:57:24,555 --> 00:57:27,510
Speaker 1: everyone says it's gotten better since then, but I'm sure it's a real con now.

1001
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,718
Speaker 1: But that Ohio con.

1002
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:30,006
Speaker 1: the second one in 2002 was not a con.

1003
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,256
Speaker 1: That was nothing that basically like.

1004
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:40,163
Speaker 0: if you think back to it compare that to like the thing they do in Wildwood in the Convention Center with Wildwood I mean, but I mean compared to the baseball card thing.

1005
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:41,450
Speaker 0: It's pretty equal to that, right?

1006

00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:15,490
Speaker 1: We're sitting there There's some people in the audience and like a bunch of our crews there and no one like shows up And eventually we all kind of look at each other and we're like we were in the RIT anime club.

1014
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're this our panel.

1016
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:28,969
Speaker 1: And we kind of wormed our way and did a similar thing at Otakon the same year in 2002 to the same panel the anime club summit.

1017
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:36,288
Speaker 1: and Then we did that panel every year at Otakon for a couple more years and then from there geek nights And now we've got like a hundred and fifty something.

Speaker 0: pan Yeah, cuz.

1019
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:41,615

Speaker 0: Yeah, and we're the host of geek nights.

Speaker 0: yeah It's also some possible vampire who are worth watching.

1072
01:01:04,562 --> 01:01:08,290

01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:42,312
Speaker 1: you know The enemy you should see which is like a big panel and then I had to do with eyes on o sensei's panel and all This stuff.

1149
01:05:42,995 --> 01:05:48,437
Speaker 1: so I basically handed why at this radio just as there's all these people all of us be like We need room from panels to come here.

1150
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:49,702
Speaker 1: We need room from panels to come here.

1151
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:53,986
Speaker 1: and I gave wife ready I'm like, you're me have fun and I booked.

1152
01:05:54,006 --> 01:05:59,590
Speaker 0: yeah I mean most of our problems really stemmed from the publications, right?

1153
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:09,150
Speaker 0: Which was due to the fact that because we had the real schedule, but we couldn't get the real schedule out there Most people had the flawed schedule got the addendum and the addendum which was also flawed.

1154
01:06:09,494 --> 01:06:10,789
Speaker 1: It was only flawed in two ways.

1155
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:16,570
Speaker 1: One panel did not actually say said panel and didn't say the number two of them and the workshops are all flipped in the addendum.

1156
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,993
Speaker 1: That was it.

1157
01:06:17,296 --> 01:06:17,498
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1158
01:06:17,518 --> 01:06:18,445
Speaker 0: Well only on Friday.

1159
01:06:18,506 --> 01:06:21,850
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, the addendum had some problems.

1160
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:28,309
Speaker 0: We're working on that for next year, but next year if the publications are perfect Which I suspect they should be the schedule will be finalized early enough.

1161
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:33,346
Speaker 0: So there shouldn't be really that many changes if any to that final printed schedule.

1162
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:38,588
Speaker 0: and it'll be so amazing Because every no one will say where's the whatever or what time is the war?

1163
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:39,090
Speaker 0: or you know?

1164
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:41,310
Speaker 0: What's gonna be in this webcomic TBA slot?

1165
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:42,533
Speaker 0: It'll just be perfect.

1166
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:48,070
Speaker 0: and we found out we actually are allowed to put up, you know, the standees outside the rooms.

1167
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,018
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I'll buy myself if I have to.

1168
01:06:50,198 --> 01:06:51,122
Speaker 0: yeah, we'll just do it.

1169
01:06:51,243 --> 01:06:51,925
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen.

1170
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:53,953
Speaker 0: So, there you go It's gonna be perfect.

1171
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:55,639
Speaker 1: Connecticut was freaking awesome.

1172
01:06:56,121 --> 01:06:58,710
Speaker 1: And basically it's a con where I don't think it's at the point.

1173
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:01,450
Speaker 1: I wouldn't feel like if I lived in Seattle, I would not fly to Hartford.

1174
01:07:01,611 --> 01:07:04,624
Speaker 0: No, I anyone who travel, you know, it's not something you should travel far to.

1175
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:08,374
Speaker 0: but if you're in New England Maybe not North Maine but if you're

1176
01:07:08,414 --> 01:07:11,624
Speaker 1: within like three or so three or four hours of Hartford, Connecticut if you're

1177
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:20,410
Speaker 0: in New England or New York City or Even Northern Jersey or Southern New York State Southeastern New York State ish area, you know between the Hudson the Mid-Hudson Valley

1178
01:07:21,891 --> 01:07:22,152
Speaker 1: Con

1179
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:31,528
Speaker 0: you got to go to gotta go to Connecticut, you know anywhere in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut Maybe South New Hampshire Vermont even Connecticut is where it's at.

1180
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:34,550
Speaker 1: Yep Oh, so we had you know, one of the panels we had to add.

1181
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,380
Speaker 1: It was actually like a big deal like one of our guests.

1182
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,158
Speaker 1: kind of panels aren't the hypnotist He does like a hypnosis show.

1183
01:07:39,178 --> 01:07:39,884
Speaker 1: He doesn't every year.

1184
01:07:39,924 --> 01:07:40,650
Speaker 1: It's always awesome.

1185
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:44,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm I get this hypnotist guy he comes in and we're doing Good Morning Connecticut, right?

1186
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:48,450
Speaker 0: And I'm sort of a little bit skeptical, you know me we're skeptical on this show.

1187
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,949
Speaker 1: So he's he comes in and Scott's like this hypnosis really work.

1188
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:53,402
Speaker 0: I'm like, is this for real?

1189
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:54,089
Speaker 0: And you know what?

1190
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:59,546
Speaker 0: 90% of this question 90% of his answers to my questions were not Randy.

1191
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:00,710
Speaker 0: There was a little bit right?

1192
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,270
Speaker 1: He was talking about it's weird cuz he'd edge toward Randy.

1193
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:06,510
Speaker 1: But the last second he'd be like, but you know the reality of science blah blah blah.

1194
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:07,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like.

1195
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:08,095
Speaker 0: he was like.

1196
01:08:08,136 --> 01:08:12,809
Speaker 0: there are some studies into breast augmentation by hypnosis and I'm like, uh-huh Really?

1197
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:19,037
Speaker 0: Boobs getting bigger waving a watch in front of your face, but then he's like, yeah Placebo effect and all these things like.

1198
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,170
Speaker 0: he was definitely not a man who believed that it was magic.

1199
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:23,696
Speaker 0: He definitely believed it was science.

1200
01:08:23,716 --> 01:08:28,171
Speaker 0: He definitely had studied the science and you know, neuro-linguistic whatever's counts for a lot Too is he was.

1201
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:29,136
Speaker 1: he was for real.

1202
01:08:29,237 --> 01:08:30,060
Speaker 1: He's hilarious.

1203
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,250
Speaker 0: He is also an excellent entertainer.

1204
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:39,703
Speaker 0: So I highly recommend art the hypnotist for your and like if you have a kid's birthday party Why don't get the lame magician who pulls the bunny out of the head?

1205
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:40,950
Speaker 0: get art the hypnotist seriously.

1206
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:45,970
Speaker 1: But the best and what we learned is no Scott's grilling him, right and we had this audience for Good Morning Connecticut.

1207
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,529
Speaker 1: We got to do a Q&A with this guy like as a panel because people why don't we get him on the geek nights?

1208
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,787
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good idea.

1209
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:52,872
Speaker 0: Also, right.

1210
01:08:52,912 --> 01:08:58,010
Speaker 0: We had these two guys who also came to Good Morning Connecticut and they were doing the how to build a gaming computer.

1211
01:08:58,091 --> 01:09:04,170
Speaker 0: So I'm like, uh-huh So do you think as so I'm grilling them too because I just love grilling people, right?

1212
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,010
Speaker 0: I'm like see you think SLI is a good idea.

1213
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:06,312
Speaker 0: They're like.

1214
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:09,408
Speaker 0: no you should get just one video card and I'm like Intel or ATI.

1215
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,580
Speaker 0: they're like, okay, if you need you really need to save money.

1216
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:16,569
Speaker 0: get the eight, you know the AMD but Really Intel is is the quality teller ATI.

1217
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:20,250
Speaker 0: I freaking grilled them and they had the right answer to every question.

1218
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:21,197
Speaker 0: These guys were the.

1219
01:09:21,519 --> 01:09:22,910
Speaker 0: they would give the same advice as me.

1220
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:24,676
Speaker 0: So their panel was totally sweet and awesome.

1221
01:09:24,737 --> 01:09:26,063
Speaker 0: even had a computer there.

1222
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:27,649
Speaker 0: so they could show you putting it together.

1223
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:28,993
Speaker 0: Excellent panel.

1224
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:31,581
Speaker 1: one building a computer guy actually, so we had the.

Speaker 1: Phil did a parkour panel.

01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,635
Speaker 1: We had a workshops and everything.

1228
01:09:35,774 --> 01:09:36,358
Speaker 0: Excellent thing.

1229
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:37,180
Speaker 1: We learned from this.

1230
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:39,330
Speaker 1: There's a huge parkour community in Hartford.

1231
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:40,997
Speaker 1: Yep, they all showed up there.

1232
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:45,658
Speaker 0: They're all these like parkour experts like ah, man parkour Did they come to the con because of the parkour?

1233
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:48,228
Speaker 1: supposedly some did oh snap.

1234
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:50,276
Speaker 0: See look at that That's what you get for diversify.

01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:51,622
Speaker 1: Yeah, Phil was like, oh my god.

01:09:52,987 --> 01:09:53,710
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

1238
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:55,279
Speaker 0: How about the the para?

01:10:00,392 --> 01:10:01,764
Speaker 0: Who else is right?

1242
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:02,370
Speaker 1: he's doing his show.

1243
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,718
Speaker 0: I just need you actually saw.

1244
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:05,207
Speaker 0: I didn't get to see any of the show.

1245
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:06,877
Speaker 1: sadly I just sneak into the rooms.

1246
01:10:06,918 --> 01:10:07,541
Speaker 1: I took my head in.

1247
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:08,950
Speaker 0: I'm watching and you got hypnotized.

1248
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:09,836
Speaker 0: He trapped you there.

1249
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:10,602
Speaker 1: Basically.

1250
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:11,650
Speaker 1: I was watching it.

1251
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,664
Speaker 1: I had to you know, why watch it a little bit?

1252
01:10:13,704 --> 01:10:14,590
Speaker 1: and I went to the front door.

1253
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:16,629
Speaker 1: I tried to sneak in to get an audio cable out from the back.

1254
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:26,950
Speaker 1: so he looks at me and I just kind of like stopped and stood there like I was mesmerized and Then the crowd the crowds were nuts and then he totally played with it and he went with it.

1255
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:27,973
Speaker 1: So I went with it.

1256
01:10:28,013 --> 01:10:28,696
Speaker 1: It was hilarious.

1257
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:29,840
Speaker 1: Let me go.

1258
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:31,425
Speaker 0: But of course that was fake.

1259
01:10:31,445 --> 01:10:33,607
Speaker 0: You were not actually hypnotized No, but it was hilarious.

1260
01:10:36,194 --> 01:10:42,356
Speaker 0: You should have been like yes master I Don't know what else I can say.

1261
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:43,801
Speaker 1: This was freakin awesome and not.

1262
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:47,214
Speaker 1: and as a testament to you know How much we love kinetic?

1263
01:10:47,234 --> 01:10:47,897
Speaker 0: Well, I can.

1264
01:10:48,139 --> 01:10:50,349
Speaker 0: let me try to make some negatives of kinetic on right?

1265
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,462
Speaker 0: Publications we failed slightly.

1266
01:10:52,483 --> 01:10:56,405
Speaker 0: Yep Well kind of bigly as medium failure.

1267
01:10:56,466 --> 01:11:00,045
Speaker 0: on publications The parking is still a lot of monies.

1268
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:08,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Harvard still sucks for food still better than Actually Citicon was the only other economy trouble with food at.

1269
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:12,330
Speaker 0: yeah Let me try to think of what else sucks.

1270
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:16,144
Speaker 0: You do have to wait in line for the badge Even though it's not an epic line and somebody will fix that.

1271
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:18,690
Speaker 1: and next year No panelists left to wait in line.

1272
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:26,781
Speaker 0: There is that down there is an awesome system of getting tickets for playing board games that get you awesome prizes Like you can get an actual board game.

1273
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:28,210
Speaker 0: You can get oshi a great game.

1274
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:30,602
Speaker 0: They had a huge stack of it for like seven tickets.

1275
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:32,110
Speaker 0: That's how it's crazy.

1276
01:11:32,231 --> 01:11:34,286
Speaker 0: You can get like $40 board games for like 12 tickets.

1277
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:39,610
Speaker 1: Well what they pointed out was and so I suggested they need to basically in have inflation a little bit in the tickets.

1278
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:40,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, they need some.

1279
01:11:40,756 --> 01:11:41,802
Speaker 0: they need tickets to get.

1280
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:43,190
Speaker 0: you need to be able to get more of them.

1281
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:50,350
Speaker 0: They need them to be worth a little bit less and they need to make it more Publicized that the ticketing system exists and how it works because it's not very consistent.

1282
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:57,815
Speaker 0: So like you actually like are just there for board games and you want to get a copy of a board game for reals For you know tickets.

1283
01:11:58,317 --> 01:12:01,790
Speaker 0: you have to play a lot of board games and really work this system.

1284
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:10,350
Speaker 1: That is not so well explained though in the count feedback It was great because one person they made this really valid point about how the tickets need to be Devalued a little bit to make it work better and they're perfectly right.

1285
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:15,971
Speaker 0: I think we should do it only value devalued a little bit because I think it's kind of awesome that a ticket is worth so Much.

1286
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:24,560
Speaker 0: right if the ticket isn't worth a lot like you go to the arcade and it's like a thousand tickets you get the plastic Frog, it's like you don't feel like getting any tickets.

1287
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,503
Speaker 0: Why should I bother?

1288
01:12:25,784 --> 01:12:27,470
Speaker 0: but if the tickets are so valuable?

1289
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:31,190
Speaker 0: You'll be like I will fucking do anything to get a ticket, but they pointed out the fact that alright.

1290
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:38,297
Speaker 1: So because of the way the tickets work if you play like ten games in the one period you only get tickets for one of Them and she's like you don't get anything.

1291
01:12:38,658 --> 01:12:47,609
Speaker 1: and the one staffer like the gaming guy was basically like well I'm assuming you had fun playing the game and she was like, oh, yeah Yeah, I was like, oh because you need to be paid to play for it.

1292
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:51,089
Speaker 0: You know, you wouldn't have played the board game if you weren't basically being paid to do it, right?

1293
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:52,594
Speaker 0: But no, but they should.

1294
01:12:52,614 --> 01:12:56,850
Speaker 0: I think the system should basically be what I thought the system was but I was apparently incorrect.

1295
01:12:57,533 --> 01:13:04,470
Speaker 0: If you play a board game right by taking it out checking it out You mark down the time you took it out and the time you brought it back, right?

1296
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:15,772
Speaker 0: They should just give you one ticket per half hour Right, but it had you had to have actually played, you know, and yeah, so I check out oshi and I come back four hours Later.

1297
01:13:15,852 --> 01:13:17,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I won the board gaming.

1298
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,210
Speaker 0: people can tell right if you've played it or not.

1299
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,576
Speaker 0: They can ask you how the game works.

1300
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:23,263
Speaker 0: They can ask they ask who won the game.

1301
01:13:23,343 --> 01:13:37,010
Speaker 0: right give the extra ticket to the winner Right, so, you know, obviously people might try to work the system But you can monitor that right if someone comes up for the second time because giving someone one ticket You know for falseness is not is not a problem, right?

1302
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:40,181
Speaker 0: But giving them two tickets for lying is kind of okay.

1303
01:13:40,643 --> 01:13:42,130
Speaker 0: Maybe we're gonna check you the second time.

1304
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,749
Speaker 0: So if someone comes up a second time, just keep your eye on them.

1305
01:13:45,111 --> 01:13:49,290
Speaker 0: Look that they're actually playing a game over at one of the tables and if they are keep giving them tickets.

1306
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:51,221
Speaker 0: And if not, then be like look I watched you.

1307
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:52,890
Speaker 0: you just walked out with that and didn't come back.

1308
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,678
Speaker 1: Of course, you know, that's another department.

1309
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:55,120
Speaker 1: Basically.

1310
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:56,105
Speaker 1: I'm so happy with ya.

1311
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,110
Speaker 0: that has nothing to do with us.

1312
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:57,998
Speaker 0: That's a game department.

1313
01:13:58,038 --> 01:13:59,027
Speaker 0: We got no control over that.

1314
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:01,857
Speaker 0: Yeah, is that a con?

1315
01:14:02,058 --> 01:14:02,541
Speaker 0: is that the end?

1316
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:03,790
Speaker 1: I think that's the end.

1317
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:05,735
Speaker 0: But we're oh there.

1318
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,679
Speaker 0: I have one more negative.

1319
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,241
Speaker 0: come on more.

1320
01:14:07,462 --> 01:14:09,310
Speaker 0: Yes the dealers room, right?

1321
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:12,100
Speaker 0: They have this bag check and on Friday.

1322
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,729
Speaker 0: The bag check was for the video games and for the dealer room.

1323
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,151
Speaker 0: now the thing is it's They.

1324
01:14:17,493 --> 01:14:22,760
Speaker 0: they decided to stop doing bag check for dealer room, which is good Cuz what other con does bag check for dealer room?

1325
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:23,884
Speaker 0: not Oda come right?

1326
01:14:23,965 --> 01:14:25,170
Speaker 0: No almost none of them, right?

1327
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,113
Speaker 0: So that made no sense.

1328
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:29,503
Speaker 0: Also you go into the dealer room your dealer area.

1329
01:14:30,024 --> 01:14:33,769
Speaker 0: you get a. you know You buy something they give you a bag.

1330
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:35,997
Speaker 0: So what's the point of the bag check?

1331
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,826
Speaker 0: right that bag check on the way out make sense.

1332
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:39,870
Speaker 0: doing the receipt thing?

1333
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:43,430
Speaker 0: You know, even though I don't like that but doing it on the way in makes no sense.

1334
01:14:43,852 --> 01:14:44,938
Speaker 0: However, there is.

1335
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,150
Speaker 0: there is no, you know lying about it.

1336
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:50,462
Speaker 0: There is a shoplifting problem in the kinetic on dealing room.

1337
01:14:50,803 --> 01:14:52,590
Speaker 0: Of course any dealers were very upset.

1338
01:14:53,452 --> 01:15:01,130
Speaker 0: It happens at a lot of cons more and more yes But a kinetic on it is particularly a problem and I really don't know what to do.

1339
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:06,350
Speaker 0: I mean, we might just have to hire like real security to actually stand in the dealers room looking around.

1340
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:06,714
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1341
01:15:07,118 --> 01:15:08,109
Speaker 0: Is that even gonna stop it?

1342
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:13,189
Speaker 1: I don't get standees of cops and put them just Outside where it looks like it's a real cop standing there like 20 of them lined up.

1343
01:15:13,732 --> 01:15:16,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I really I really have no idea what to do about that.

1344
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:18,415
Speaker 0: Oh speaking of cops I'll make this the final note.

1345
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:21,170
Speaker 0: I remember my story about the racist guy at the barbershop.

1346
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:24,450
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I there were two cops just standing in the hotel at kinetic.

1347
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,118
Speaker 1: Oh, those guys were also awesome.

1348
01:15:26,419 --> 01:15:27,866
Speaker 0: So real cops Hartford cops.

1349
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:30,523
Speaker 0: So I was like, hey dudes I have this completely unrelated question for you.

1350
01:15:30,543 --> 01:15:31,328
Speaker 0: So they're like, hey, what's up?

1351
01:15:32,132 --> 01:15:33,985
Speaker 0: They were you know, they I almost thought they were firemen.

1352
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:35,174
Speaker 0: They were so nice I mean and you.

1353
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:36,830
Speaker 1: so what you're like, so I got this weed, right?

1354
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,734
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I was like.

1355
01:15:37,754 --> 01:15:40,770
Speaker 0: I was like I was in this barbershop and this dude was so racist.

1356
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:41,774
Speaker 0: I'm like, what would you do?

1357
01:15:41,814 --> 01:15:44,667
Speaker 0: They're like, oh man, it's like you can't do anything.

1358
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:45,309
Speaker 0: It just sucks.

1359
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:46,993
Speaker 0: But they were.

1360
01:15:47,033 --> 01:15:47,857
Speaker 0: they were totally cool.

1361
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,182
Speaker 0: They they gave me some advice.

1362
01:15:49,222 --> 01:15:53,658
Speaker 0: So awesome to the cops in the hotel And kinetic on 2010 is out.

1363
01:15:53,919 --> 01:15:54,100
Speaker 1: Yep.

1364
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,551
Speaker 1: So we will see you guys at kinetic on 2011.

1365
01:15:56,551 --> 01:16:02,670
Speaker 0: I hope will be opening panel submissions sooner than you'll expect as soon as the website people get their stuff in order.

1366
01:16:02,811 --> 01:16:07,030
Speaker 1: Yep, and we're already like content like we're already putting together the list of people we want to invite back.

1367
01:16:07,732 --> 01:16:08,015
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1368
01:16:08,216 --> 01:16:09,529
Speaker 1: You guys did awesome panels.

1369
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,359
Speaker 1: Do you want to do another panel next year?

1370
01:16:12,379 --> 01:16:14,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think though we're gonna.

1371
01:16:14,549 --> 01:16:16,139
Speaker 0: you know The people who did like ten panels.

1372
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,529
Speaker 0: we should shrink them down to three or four.

1373
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:20,681
Speaker 0: We kind of had a turning maybe put like a three or four maximum on.

1374
01:16:20,721 --> 01:16:25,710
Speaker 1: we had to turn away a lot of panel submissions And I think we're only gonna have to turn away more and more.

1375
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:30,550
Speaker 1: We're really kinetic on is reaching a turning point to where we're gonna be able to be really picky and choose.

1376
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:38,150
Speaker 0: Well, I think the best of the best but we can so we can do is we always want to let in some new stuff Each time so we can let reruns happen next year.

1377
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:43,400
Speaker 0: But I don't think we should allow reruns more than anything to go more than two years in a row Even if it's really popular.

1378
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,617
Speaker 0: and then you know If one group runs a lot of panels.

1379
01:16:46,697 --> 01:16:51,678
Speaker 0: we can shrink them to like a limit of three or four and have them cycle it Right if they want to stick around.

1380
01:16:51,698 --> 01:16:54,010
Speaker 0: if they can't cycle it then we can let someone new in.

1381
01:16:54,091 --> 01:16:55,110
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what we do at PAX.

1382
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,823
Speaker 1: We don't run beyond D&D at every PAX despite the fact that they kept.

1383
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,130
Speaker 0: I think beyond D&D is dead.

1384
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:03,070
Speaker 0: Oh my god, my running of beyond D&D was perhaps the worst beyond D&D we've ever done.

1385
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:04,494
Speaker 0: It was so there was fun.

1386
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:09,170
Speaker 0: There was almost no one in there and I like you change the panel or the order of the slides.

1387
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,616
Speaker 0: There's something now you just forgot.

1388
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:11,499
Speaker 0: it was so messed up.

1389
01:17:12,022 --> 01:17:14,030
Speaker 0: Our other panels are really good though, so it makes up for it.

1390
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:17,590
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I love running anime anime openers from around the world.

1391
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:20,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is like my favorite panel to run.

1392
01:17:20,138 --> 01:17:22,084
Speaker 0: bite-sized anime was alright.

1393
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:26,678
Speaker 0: The Mika panel was pretty great and Anime CC was great, and we're good.

1394
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:30,100
Speaker 1: We ran a bunch of like quickie panels.

1395
01:17:30,181 --> 01:17:30,321
Speaker 1: like.

1396
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,890
Speaker 1: there was one panelist who showed up late.

1397
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:32,757
Speaker 1: So I did a quick thing on.

1398
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:34,330
Speaker 1: you know, I had a harmonica with me.

1399
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:38,049
Speaker 1: So I was like, hey, I'll teach you guys how to play the harmonica and people seem to really like it.

1400
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:39,337
Speaker 0: We're really done now for real.

1401
01:17:39,357 --> 01:17:40,343
Speaker 1: We're really done for real.

1402
01:17:40,363 --> 01:17:41,389
