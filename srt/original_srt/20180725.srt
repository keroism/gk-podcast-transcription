1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,945
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday July 25th 2018.

2
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,551
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:17,260
Speaker 1: tonight We are reviewing the anime cells at work.

4
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,758
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,025
Speaker 1: So yeah, we did that bike ride.

6
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:26,040
Speaker 1: We also had to camp in a pretty heavy rainstorm.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,540
Speaker 1: I think you had to get up while the rain was still going to start.

8
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:31,798
Speaker 0: So what happened is I you know before the night before I'm like.

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,099
Speaker 0: well You know if it rains as long as it's not raining so hard that I can't bike at all.

10
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:37,964
Speaker 0: right It's not won't be.

11
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:40,140
Speaker 0: and it's like because what am I doing after biking?

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,291
Speaker 0: It's not like it as long as I can bike safely.

13
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,766
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if I'm wet It's not like I'm going.

14
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:49,969
Speaker 1: so in my opinion no Amount of rain by itself makes biking unsafe.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,058
Speaker 1: I have bikes home from work in New York like seven miles.

16
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:55,926
Speaker 1: They're in Driving sheeting rain.

17
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,375
Speaker 0: I have been caught in driving rain.

18
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:01,893
Speaker 0: the problem is there Occasions where if the rain is too much he can't go as fast.

19
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:09,186
Speaker 0: if you're got to go up a steep hill And it's raining might slip and fall down because not enough traction You could see.

20
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:12,425
Speaker 1: if you're going in a straight line uphill You could slip in the rain.

21
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,799
Speaker 1: your tires were already in a bad state saying it can happen.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,546
Speaker 0: No, it could be a slippery patch.

23
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:19,153
Speaker 0: You know going over a metal thing.

24
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:19,414
Speaker 0: There's.

25
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:23,385
Speaker 0: you know the rain could be so much You can't even see You could be.

26
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:25,994
Speaker 1: I biked home once in rain where I actually couldn't see.

27
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:31,980
Speaker 0: I would stop and wait till I could see and then You could have a situation where it's flooded and it's too deep.

28
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:35,274
Speaker 1: So one time me and Ken were biking through the woods.

29
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:50,127
Speaker 1: This is back in us in high school, and we're following the trail, and we're pretty far away from home and just horrible thunderstorms going and we come to a place where we basically cross a river and the Clinton River and it's flooded.

30
00:01:50,990 --> 00:02:01,670
Speaker 1: so we just kind of biked through it and it was basically I was biking in water that was up to my neck while I was on the bike and We totally made it to the other side.

31
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,534
Speaker 1: It was totally fine.

32
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:03,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not doing that.

33
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:08,082
Speaker 1: The only drawback was Laughter.

34
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,605
Speaker 0: I'm gonna bring my all my stuff Through the water.

35
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,929
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, see this was an error.

36
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,784
Speaker 1: remember before cell phones let alone smart phones And I would.

37
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,280
Speaker 1: why would I carry my wallet when I'm in high school biking around?

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,976
Speaker 1: So the only thing I had in my pocket was a key to get back into my house.

39
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:25,998
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm but anyway.

40
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:32,841
Speaker 0: So when I woke up the rain wasn't too bad And I was getting ready to go and then I like see I'm supposed to start at 7.

41
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:36,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't have to start to like 830 at 645.

42
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,855
Speaker 0: It starts raining like more.

43
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:38,677
Speaker 0: It's not raining.

44
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,560
Speaker 0: It's like borderline.

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,187
Speaker 0: We're like mmm, right?

46
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:46,987
Speaker 1: I was in the tent and I was lately or listen to that rain thinking Yeah, I ain't getting up yet.

47
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,553
Speaker 0: So I go over to the P.

48
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:49,376
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even get up and go.

49
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,320
Speaker 0: pee already registered.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,268
Speaker 0: I went to the registration booth and I was like hey if I go and the rain slows me down too much And I don't make it back in time.

51
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:59,060
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, yeah, I just call us this number.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,789
Speaker 0: Well, I will bring you back to the beginning.

53
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,800
Speaker 0: We'll parachute you to a further destiny.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,271
Speaker 0: We'll do whatever you want and I'm like, oh, okay.

55
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:06,556
Speaker 0: So I'm just like fuck it.

56
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:07,279
Speaker 0: I came out here.

57
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:08,709
Speaker 0: I just started biking.

58
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:22,531
Speaker 0: There's no one else out there But there's like the one person waving me on like alright, go ahead and I go out there and I encountered this tree and It's not a boy like an end like it's not an enormous tree.

59
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:32,939
Speaker 0: it was maybe like, you know five inches Diameter, you know, but nice solid big solid solid tree, you know, not a you know as a young tree But not a baby just born tree ain't no twig, you know.

60
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:37,180
Speaker 0: And it was across the path and I could have just picked up my bike gone over and kept going.

61
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,380
Speaker 0: But I'm like, nope, I got to move this tree.

62
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:41,969
Speaker 1: So yeah Cuz there's gonna be hundreds and hundreds of bikers behind you.

63
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:52,960
Speaker 0: that well the bottom of the tree is sort of still Not completely detached and the top of the tree as all as many branches that are Interfering with these still living trees on the other side of the path.

64
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,926
Speaker 0: So I can't move it very effectively.

65
00:03:54,946 --> 00:04:00,446
Speaker 0: and then one person comes up behind me and I wave at them and he you know It's another guy biking.

66
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,015
Speaker 0: He comes and we both move the tree.

67
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:02,939
Speaker 0: He's much stronger than me.

68
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,063
Speaker 0: Armed apartment.

69
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:09,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now there's no one else and we took us a while to move the tree.

70
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:12,905
Speaker 0: No one else came Nobody.

71
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,212
Speaker 0: so we just start biking together.

72
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:19,533
Speaker 1: He's going on the same path as me Because my route actually went the opposite direction to start.

73
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:21,200
Speaker 1: so I wouldn't have even encountered the tree.

74
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,832
Speaker 0: So I just hung out with this dude Chris from Ohio.

75
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,399
Speaker 0: It apparently does this right every year.

76
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:29,660
Speaker 0: He's apparently 20 years older than me and we went about the same speed.

77
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:34,299
Speaker 0: No, but then when there was like maybe 10 miles left, I was like bleh and he was still just fine.

78
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:39,340
Speaker 1: So, you know almost cuz I ride a hybrid and but it's a fancy like it's a light hybrid.

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,219
Speaker 1: But most people don't think that you could get a fancy hybrid, but I'm biking doing my thing.

80
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:52,907
Speaker 1: Almost a dozen people came up behind me on the road bikes road next to me on this 80 mile ride and Turned and said basically the exact same thing.

81
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,636
Speaker 1: I can't believe you're doing this on a hybrid.

82
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:56,920
Speaker 0: I saw lots of hybrid bikes.

83
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,840
Speaker 0: I don't know why anyone would say that to you.

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,827
Speaker 1: So I did not see a single hybrid bike on my route until I joined the 40 mile route at the end On the 80 mile route at no point.

85
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,611
Speaker 1: Did I say a hybrid?

86
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:08,957
Speaker 0: I saw hybrid but I didn't.

87
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,686
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know What route I was on.

88
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:20,214
Speaker 1: cuz yeah until there until my route bumped into like the people who are going my route had this section That is that was exclusive to the baby.

89
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:21,560
Speaker 0: This is the baby hundred.

90
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:28,579
Speaker 0: Yeah Which is basically go out of your way in his loop to go to a high school Then go all the way back and rejoin everyone else at the end.

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,834
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, my 80 did we didn't see we saw almost nobody out there.

92
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:39,760
Speaker 0: my that rest stop had like a few kids And no I'd like manning, you know a table full of snacks and nothing else.

93
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,089
Speaker 1: My 80-mile route did all the two hard parts of the real hundred But then it skipped this like 20 mile section at the end.

94
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,876
Speaker 1: That was not hard, but I didn't.

95
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,087
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't do that last 20 miles.

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,871
Speaker 0: hmm Anyway, but yeah, and then I saw a former co-worker.

97
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:56,019
Speaker 0: They're just like, oh, you know free foods.

98
00:05:56,239 --> 00:06:01,720
Speaker 1: one thing I thought was funny though is one hundred percent of the people who made a comment about my hybrid.

99
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,615
Speaker 1: I passed and never saw again.

100
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:06,825
Speaker 0: So It's not a race.

101
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,295
Speaker 1: No, but I like to go fast.

102
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:08,979
Speaker 1: I'd be a good time.

103
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:13,874
Speaker 1: I averaged about 14 miles an hour including breaks, which is pretty good for a ride like that.

104
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:25,232
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's anime day So we're not gonna talk about biking anymore Unless we're talking about a biking anime and there's a lot of news cuz that's DCC just happened Mm-hmm, even though you should probably never go to use it.

105
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,300
Speaker 0: We're usually mad short on Wednesday news.

106
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,840
Speaker 0: Now we got a big pile of Wednesday news.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,793
Speaker 0: We're gonna use it all up and then we're gonna be out in two weeks.

108
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:32,395
Speaker 0: You won't have any.

109
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:33,540
Speaker 1: so let's start with yours.

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,114
Speaker 0: So the San Diego Comic Con.

111
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,140
Speaker 0: they have the Eisner Awards.

112
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:43,960
Speaker 0: So the big news of the Eisner Awards this year is that for the first time ever?

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,665
Speaker 0: What would actually award?

114
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,914
Speaker 0: did they give Rumiko Takahashi?

115
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:48,677
Speaker 1: This is your news.

116
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:49,420
Speaker 1: I didn't read shit.

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,852
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever award she got is an award of the voter.

118
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,000
Speaker 0: I give voters choice a Hall of Fame.

119
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,940
Speaker 0: So I guess she's the first woman in the Eisner Awards Hall of Fame.

120
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,400
Speaker 1: Well, the headline says it best awards honor female manga creator writer for first time.

121
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,620
Speaker 0: Yep, so also I mean there are other awards that females have won.

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:16,040
Speaker 0: It's not like the first time a woman's ever won an Eisner Award But it is the first time a woman has won Hall of Fame and also the first time someone's won best writer.

123
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually a tie for best writer.

124
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:26,520
Speaker 0: But Tom King Tom King who's a Batman guy and Marjorie Liu the first woman and to ever win best writer.

125
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:35,923
Speaker 0: I think her book Monstress also won like best continuing series and the Tea Dragon Society, which I had thought about buying a few times Because I've seen it.

126
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,654
Speaker 0: I love the art and I didn't realize it was also webcomic.

127
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,660
Speaker 0: It won like two or three awards.

128
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:51,940
Speaker 0: So yeah, like monstrous and Tea Dragon Society were big winners here and also another big winner was the Akira 35th anniversary edition.

129
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:54,545
Speaker 1: Best publication design.

130
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,026
Speaker 1: Yeah.

131
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,874
Speaker 0: Also, I think best US edition of foreign material.

132
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:58,616
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

133
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:00,059
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I think it was best.

134
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,890
Speaker 0: No best US edition of international material.

135
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,800
Speaker 0: Asia was my brother's husband which volume 2 is coming up.

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,804
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I gotta read that.

137
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:16,823
Speaker 0: but it was best archival collection comic books and also Best publication.

138
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:21,660
Speaker 1: best US edition of international material went for run for it stories of slaves who fought for freedom.

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,043
Speaker 0: Yeah They separate the Asia Categories.

140
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:28,400
Speaker 0: that because otherwise manga I guess would always win or manga would never win because they'd always pick a French thing.

141
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:29,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

142
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,740
Speaker 0: or a bond doesn't a what everyone call it.

143
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,659
Speaker 1: Well, I mean like how the comics industry in the u.s.

144
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,440
Speaker 1: Just pretends that all of Asia doesn't exist because otherwise their numbers are meaningless, right?

145
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,500
Speaker 0: You know, it's also I guess to keep manga from beating some you know, some manga cover winning best writer.

146
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:53,785
Speaker 0: That's you know, anyway the point is so if you don't know when Akira was first published in English in the US it was from Dark Horse and Otomo the creator of Akira.

147
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:57,516
Speaker 0: he helped them flip it so it would be left to right and he also isn't.

148
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,687
Speaker 0: I guess he's better Than zero in English.

149
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:09,193
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't I don't know how good at English But I think he had some input in the translation and like the redoing of the the sound effects and stuff like that.

150
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,790
Speaker 0: and then there was That Dark Horse Edition took a while to come out.

151
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,400
Speaker 0: I bought it when I was at RIT still was still coming out.

152
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,689
Speaker 0: I think I finished getting it near and beacon.

153
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:19,211
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

154
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:21,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I vaguely remember all the six volumes.

155
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaker 0: Anyway, they put it out again Kodansha put it out again and it's pretty much a reprint of almost the exact same thing.

156
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:32,273
Speaker 0: I think there were some differences but not major differences.

157
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:41,548
Speaker 0: The new one is The first English Edition is basically the same only as the Kodansha Edition But it's been flipped over.

158
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,780
Speaker 0: so it's finally right to left instead of left to right.

159
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:49,295
Speaker 0: And also it comes in a fancy box and that's what that publication of it right.

160
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:50,980
Speaker 0: that is what won the awards.

161
00:09:52,522 --> 00:10:02,235
Speaker 0: So yeah, if you haven't read Akira and you've only seen the cure you Mean you're missing out on like best one the best manga's comics that has ever been.

162
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:02,877
Speaker 0: so I don't know.

163
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,360
Speaker 1: on the actual story It's readily available.

164
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,500
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's available digitally But whatever price they're charging for that box if you don't have any version of it is totally worth it.

165
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:19,337
Speaker 1: Like even we as much as we're trying to remove physical objects from our personal possession It's worth it to own a Kira or at least have it long enough to read it.

166
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,000
Speaker 0: Have you even read it?

167
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,614
Speaker 1: I read the first Two volumes when you're gay and I never actually finished it.

168
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't know.

169
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:32,800
Speaker 1: Yeah So in some other news, that's actually pretty interesting.

170
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,000
Speaker 1: So if you recall there was the New York comic-con, which was pretty rinky-dink in the early days and slowly got bigger.

171
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:41,333
Speaker 1: We used to like go to it and do panels.

172
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:41,896
Speaker 0: I went to it.

173
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:42,520
Speaker 0: Maybe two times.

174
00:10:42,661 --> 00:11:00,478
Speaker 1: I went to it almost every year because they kept giving me the free badge every year and then I'd stop Responding and taking the free badges and then eventually they stopped emailing me and then they wanted nothing to do with us but near a comic-con basically got more Painful to go to and less fun every year there ran.

175
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:01,967
Speaker 1: We're not gonna get into that.

176
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 1: but there is also a New York anime festival.

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,913
Speaker 0: We started off as its own thing that I went to once.

178
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:09,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to it a bunch of Two times.

179
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:10,966
Speaker 0: Well, maybe we went to.

180
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:11,567
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

181
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:14,094
Speaker 1: we went to it even the last year.

182
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,440
Speaker 1: it existed even semi-independent, right?

183
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:16,883
Speaker 0: So right.

184
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:17,810
Speaker 0: All right, so it was.

185
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,757
Speaker 0: we went to it when it was.

186
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:29,520
Speaker 0: it was Right, and then it was incorporated into New York comic-con in the gym the same bill the same way that an amoeba Incorporates a poor bacterium into itself, right?

187
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,440
Speaker 0: It was in the same building, but it was in a different area of the same building.

188
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:41,515
Speaker 0: It was sort of like it was like two conventions were going on in the same building at once But there was a separate area with its own panel rooms and a little stage and its own little biz.

189
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:52,420
Speaker 0: that was physically Adjacent and your one ticket got you into both things Except the New York anime festival park got the short end of every possible state was like, you know, it was like segregation.

190
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:56,820
Speaker 1: It was so the funniest thing was it was more crowded not human rights violating.

191
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,780
Speaker 1: It was more crowded than the comic-con part more people were trying to go to the anime part.

192
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,337
Speaker 1: They're the panels are all completely full because they didn't give a no space.

193
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:14,495
Speaker 1: basically Fans of anime really wanted to go to the New York anime festival But the New York comic-con only makes us money from the Hollywood comic.

194
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:18,577
Speaker 1: You don't make any money from fan panels Nope, so they basically just got rid of.

195
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:18,899
Speaker 1: the thing

196
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:33,677
Speaker 0: I remember most is that at the when it was when you enter the incorporated one The thing I remember the most is that we were doing our panel and the panel before us were people from Krypton future media And there was the creator positive me who is like the software not the.

197
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:47,745
Speaker 1: the character It was like was on that panel and I talked to him about like what computers he has a good panel Yeah, but yes The New York anime festival was basically destroyed by the comic-con and the comic-con itself is in our opinion Unattendable because it's just.

198
00:12:47,785 --> 00:12:48,287
Speaker 1: it's an awful.

199
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:50,496
Speaker 1: It's like SDCC but lower rent.

200
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:50,777
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

201
00:12:51,219 --> 00:13:02,940
Speaker 1: So Independently of that there's a new anime convention We've talked about run by all the smart people who used to run things like the New York comic-con New York anime festival back when they were a lot better like real smart people.

202
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:16,000
Speaker 1: But the news here is that the New York comic-con is bringing back their anime festival But this time they're doing it partnering with anime Expo which runs basically the worst anime convention.

203
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:26,380
Speaker 0: Anime Expo is going to run a Different convention at the same time as New York comic-con the same weekend in a different location.

204
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:34,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you're gonna have I mean you're gonna have to go from the Javits down to P or something here 94 ride a bike down the path, I guess.

205
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,002
Speaker 1: so here's the thing I'm gonna point out.

206
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:39,012
Speaker 1: they put this convention in a place that no convention should go.

207
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,036
Speaker 1: There's no subway.

208
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:41,300
Speaker 1: There's no good buses.

209
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:42,585
Speaker 1: There's no hotels.

210
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,389
Speaker 0: There might be a bus.

211
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:44,794
Speaker 0: I don't know but it's not.

212
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,160
Speaker 0: it's not an easy place to get to.

213
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:54,573
Speaker 0: the only convenient way to get to this place is with the two B's boat I Think as a helicopter pad next to it too.

214
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:55,780
Speaker 0: You can take a helicopter there.

215
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if you know if you never have a car, it's not good to go.

216
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,011
Speaker 0: It's not a place you can go easily even with a car.

217
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,760
Speaker 0: is you can take a taxi would get you there an uber.

218
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:16,700
Speaker 0: But point is you're not gonna be able to switch between New York comic-con and this new New York anime festival replacement thing easily but even worse because The if you are running it are the are the anime Expo people the read right?

219
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:21,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'm confident even if you go I mean, maybe we'll be wrong.

220
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:21,684
Speaker 1: We don't know.

221
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,400
Speaker 1: I suspect it's gonna be a shit show and it's not gonna be fun.

222
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:29,980
Speaker 0: No And it's basically if you buy a badge to New York comic-con you can just go to this thing because it's included.

223
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,720
Speaker 0: But they're also gonna sell a badge to just the anime thing.

224
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,611
Speaker 0: But I don't know if that badge will get you into New York comic-con.

225
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:38,740
Speaker 0: I think it will get you into just the anime part.

226
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:47,477
Speaker 1: Okay, so tickets for Thursday are 20 bucks Or they're 15 bucks if you have a New York comic-con badge.

227
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:53,561
Speaker 0: Oh for Thursday Yeah, but what about the by the Friday's 15 Saturday's 20 Sunday's 20?

228
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,506
Speaker 0: I thought it's just free if you have a New York comic-con.

229
00:14:55,847 --> 00:15:00,100
Speaker 1: No tickets will be available to fan very people with verification accounts.

230
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,185
Speaker 1: So they're doing so.

231
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:07,360
Speaker 1: you have to have the account the special one That's verified that you would use to buy a New York comic-con badge.

232
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:19,953
Speaker 0: So if you got to pay extra and you know, no one's going over there Yeah, you could basically you get a five dollar discount if you already bought a goddamn New York comic-con badge to go to this For the money you got to spend to get over there.

233
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:23,849
Speaker 1: I do not know Why this is happening?

234
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:24,976
Speaker 1: Well, no, I do know why.

235
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:30,760
Speaker 0: well It's like a lot of the big cons, you know packs was did the best of spreading out all over the place.

236
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it seems like the other cons even.

237
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:42,545
Speaker 0: you know, magfest is like oh We got to have a magwest and Otakon Otakon Vegas and it's like the cons are starting to just start more Things going on there on.

238
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,448
Speaker 0: they can't get bigger.

239
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:47,980
Speaker 0: They start opening more conventions in more places and that's not a good idea.

240
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,731
Speaker 0: So anime expo has never had another con in other place.

241
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:53,180
Speaker 0: They're trying to open up a con in a different place.

242
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,659
Speaker 1: I think there's even more factors going on.

243
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,620
Speaker 1: There is crazy huge demand for conventions of nerdy stuff anime conventions gaming conventions comic conventions.

244
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:10,360
Speaker 1: The demand is insatiable and enormous and there's literally no place in America that can actually host these events effectively But simultaneously.

245
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:26,600
Speaker 1: the only way to make money from these things like real money unless you're packs and you know the secret sauce like packs does really Well for themselves But especially comic cons is to basically get people into your stupid event and pay for a badge and out as fast as possible.

246
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,532
Speaker 1: You don't want people hanging out in your convention for four days like they do it the good cons that fans actually want to go to.

247
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:58,528
Speaker 1: so there's this constant tension between The things that cons can do to make money and cater to the industry versus the things that fans of cons as Opposed to people who hear about a con and go to one for one day Once and I feel like this is gonna be yet another one of those not fun corporate style cons I don't think it'll affect they're good anime con in New York at all And we'll see how it goes, but I'm definitely not going to it October 4th through 7th.

248
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:03,831
Speaker 1: Nah, no In some other con news that's even sadder and worse.

249
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:08,470
Speaker 1: you've probably seen a lot of Talk about world con.

250
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,560
Speaker 0: so we've talked about world con in the past on geek nights.

251
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:18,388
Speaker 0: If you don't know world con is basically sort of like the oldest school original sci-fi con that there has ever been.

252
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:24,228
Speaker 0: fantasy sci-fi con there's ever been and it's been around forever and It's the litter.

253
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:30,260
Speaker 0: It's like think you know think about the most Stereotypical con of like old crusty dudes with beards.

254
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:40,580
Speaker 0: This is it and what the way it works is like it travels around to a different place every year Which makes it world con and it's usually you know, what they give out what the Hugo Awards there.

255
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, or is it then?

256
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,268
Speaker 0: now the Hugo is one of those awards.

257
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,592
Speaker 1: you go awards.

258
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,140
Speaker 0: Remember is where it's the Hugo ones, right?

259
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:48,756
Speaker 0: it's not the the other one right.

260
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:51,547
Speaker 1: the Hugo Awards the whole ballot thing.

261
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:52,171
Speaker 1: We've talked about this.

262
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:52,613
Speaker 1: I'm right.

263
00:17:52,633 --> 00:18:03,540
Speaker 1: the way they vote on them there It's like you got to go to world con and remember that is the thing where basically Gomer gate people who called themselves the sad puppies tried to sabotage it and continue.

264
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,900
Speaker 0: That's the kind of person who goes to world con.

265
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:22,120
Speaker 0: it's where it's weird like the people who go to world con will be like the world's best most famous sci-fi fantasy authors and sad crusty dudes with beards, but anyway the Thing the reason world comes in the news yet again because usually when it surprised it still exists.

266
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,592
Speaker 0: Like who's who's keeping this thing of how people go?

267
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,160
Speaker 1: It's really it's well known and popular.

268
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,807
Speaker 1: I've been going for 76 years.

269
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,514
Speaker 0: Where is where even is it this year?

270
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:30,799
Speaker 1: I don't know cuz I'm not gonna go.

271
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,934
Speaker 1: I like even way back when we won the parsec award.

272
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:36,660
Speaker 1: We didn't even go to get the award.

273
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,985
Speaker 0: That wasn't at world con.

274
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:38,507
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

275
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:41,540
Speaker 1: but we said even when we win awards, we don't show as a dragon con.

276
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,008
Speaker 1: I think it was dragon cast dragon.

277
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:47,248
Speaker 1: I'm never going to dragon got either but basically they.

278
00:18:48,504 --> 00:19:03,820
Speaker 1: The gist of this story and I'm not gonna get into all the details of it cuz you can read this is that they have people who set up their panels and people who go to Fan run conventions at least kind of expect this low bar of how panels are run at conventions.

279
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:14,360
Speaker 1: It's very rare that fan conventions have well organized well run panel content Or at least the people who organize the panel is very rare that they're good people who know what they're doing running this stuff.

280
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:44,339
Speaker 1: So a lot of the problems that happened are literally the same problems that pretty much every fan con has but they're Exacerbated by the fact that the people they that the the unqualified people are scheduling the panels for our Hugo nominees professional authors like people who are Professional and serious and have fandoms and know what they're doing who aren't gonna put up with the crap that generally goes on at fan conventions simultaneously.

281
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:53,979
Speaker 1: I Run Worldcon are probably on average old sis had white dudes that They did things like dead naming authors.

282
00:19:54,521 --> 00:20:00,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did things like just finding or making up bios about them and just putting on the website.

283
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,974
Speaker 1: They also apparently took suggestions for panels, which some cons do.

284
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:09,491
Speaker 1: it's always weird when cons like collaborate with people to run Magfest kind of.

285
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:11,045
Speaker 0: does that What do you mean?

286
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:13,840
Speaker 1: suggestions like the majors thing like they come to us?

287
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,302
Speaker 1: They're like art.

288
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:19,047
Speaker 1: everyone tell us the panels you want to do and then well from there Separately allocate people to be on those panels.

289
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:22,680
Speaker 1: Oh, I see a lot a lot of like sci-fi cons do that.

290
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,074
Speaker 1: It's not really a thing in gaming cons except the magfest mages, but I digress.

291
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:40,360
Speaker 1: but they basically Took the suggestions from a lot of the authors a lot of the Hugo Award nominees But then they didn't schedule any of the people who happen to be women or persons of color.

292
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:51,330
Speaker 1: Somehow they scheduled all these white dudes and they made all these arguments about how well we scheduled based on what we expect the attendees the core audience of Worldcon to see.

293
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,903
Speaker 1: and It's bull.

294
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:57,054
Speaker 0: I think they're basically saying I what I want to see.

295
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,600
Speaker 0: I believe I'm the core audience.

296
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:03,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think it's a combination of both Sis head white dude.

297
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:09,980
Speaker 0: not clearly the people in the People clearly in the guest relations department aren't bad because they're inviting all these guests.

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,100
Speaker 0: It's just the person in the panels department is a shit.

299
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,840
Speaker 1: Well, they're inviting these guests, but they're not actually putting them on any panels.

300
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,623
Speaker 0: So they could be.

301
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:23,054
Speaker 0: that I'm saying if if that imagine if the panels person was in charge of guest relations Those people wouldn't have even been at Worldcon.

302
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:23,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

303
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:27,851
Speaker 1: so now I suspect that I've I had a guess.

304
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:36,920
Speaker 1: I'd say that half of this is incompetence and then A quarter of it is says head white dude ignorance and another quarter of it is active malice.

305
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,129
Speaker 1: That's my guess of the ratio of all these problems.

306
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:48,840
Speaker 1: because not to name names of any particular conventions but I want to give a brief litany of Things like this that have personally happened to me or me and Scott at conventions.

307
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:53,558
Speaker 1: We showed up at a convention once that scheduled us without telling us.

308
00:21:54,422 --> 00:22:05,052
Speaker 1: That put a bio of geek nights on their page that someone wrote on their own without Consulting us and they found a logo that wasn't our logo, but was close enough.

309
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:09,283
Speaker 1: So sure we showed up at a convention once that Scheduled us.

310
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:10,267
Speaker 0: I don't remember any of this.

311
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:11,230
Speaker 1: These were all.

312
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,818
Speaker 1: all of these were at one particular convention.

313
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:14,240
Speaker 0: Okay?

314
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:20,290
Speaker 1: we showed up one year and they Had actually scheduled the same panels.

315
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,553
Speaker 1: We did the previous year.

316
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:33,219
Speaker 1: that year again instead of the panels They told us they scheduled and I remember sitting there for now for a few minutes going through their schedule Finding the panels that looked like they were ours and just showing up to them assuming we had to run them.

317
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:46,312
Speaker 1: I have been adjacent to panel staff that did things like Worldcon did like literally going to someone's Facebook page copy pasting Information from their profile and just putting it on the convention website.

318
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:56,580
Speaker 1: So a lot of these things happen Commonly at low-rent conventions or poorly run conventions usually because the people running the panels departments have no idea what they're doing.

319
00:22:57,063 --> 00:23:04,220
Speaker 1: I mean, they're either not paid or they're paid at best Minimum wage for the small amount of time they actually work.

320
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,260
Speaker 1: But usually they're just not paid even if the cons are for profit.

321
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:11,776
Speaker 1: So you can read this article if you want to see the real utter shit show that this was.

322
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:14,688
Speaker 1: but the result was all these Authors were like, you know what screw it.

323
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,174
Speaker 1: We're not even coming now.

324
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:16,736
Speaker 1: Never mind.

325
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:17,700
Speaker 1: You had your chance.

326
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:19,665
Speaker 1: We're not even gonna bother attending.

327
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:35,346
Speaker 1: and now Worldcon has responded by basically saying they're tearing apart their panels department And they're starting over with the programming even though that's obviously too little too late and I am confident They will not be able to find people who are competent to Solve this problem in time.

328
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,380
Speaker 1: and I don't think any of those authors are gonna change their minds and decide.

329
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:45,824
Speaker 0: Listen Worldcon and the Hugo Awards only have any respect because people you know I guess give it respect.

330
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:51,480
Speaker 0: right publishers put on their books like Hugo Award nominee Hugo Award winner authors continue to go to.

331
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,320
Speaker 1: Well, why does the Worldcon go to the publishers?

332
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:53,942
Speaker 0: I don't.

333
00:23:54,103 --> 00:24:01,840
Speaker 0: why don't these a publishers, you know It's like stop respecting the Hugo Award as an award that matters and stop putting it on your books.

334
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,750
Speaker 0: Just ignore it right authors.

335
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,474
Speaker 0: Just ignore it.

336
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:05,620
Speaker 0: Stop going to Worldcon.

337
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,079
Speaker 0: I guess it's easy to say is not an author someone's gonna tell me like I shouldn't tell them what to do and they're probably Right, yeah, but I think there's an easy.

338
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,640
Speaker 0: Easily just kill world, you know The.

339
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:18,252
Speaker 0: the power of the author is it can definitely just kill Worldcon.

340
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:19,415
Speaker 0: make something else.

341
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:20,840
Speaker 0: make your own goddamn award.

342
00:24:21,185 --> 00:24:22,117
Speaker 0: You could buy them out.

343
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:26,479
Speaker 0: They I know Worldcon has like one of those stupid crazy governance systems also, right?

344
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:35,019
Speaker 0: Somebody could also stage an operation where you could basically Brigade, you know the evil Brigades of Worldcon and take it over.

345
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:41,820
Speaker 0: Let's get enough people to go there and and you know work within their constitution or whatever and you just take that thing over right?

346
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:44,130
Speaker 1: That makes it very subtle.

347
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,040
Speaker 0: I was a group of Awesome, not old white dude sci-fi fantasy authors.

348
00:24:50,201 --> 00:24:54,334
Speaker 0: I would get together with my publishers and my fans and do exactly that and this is it.

349
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:57,686
Speaker 1: but there's the same voice from the Worldcon reading between the lines of what you said.

350
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:07,500
Speaker 1: if the Hugo Awards were a Big deal in terms of like books actually selling in things Publishers would just game the system.

351
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:17,238
Speaker 1: I Feel like the fact that no one appears to just use money to game the system except those Gilmer Gators Implies that it isn't worth their time or money to do it.

352
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:28,840
Speaker 1: But the other thing is if Worldcon is serious about this and they want the Hugo Awards to be treated with respect You could hire one person who knows what they're doing to do this part for your convention like pay him up.

353
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:30,559
Speaker 0: They think they know what they're doing.

354
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,421
Speaker 0: Dudes.

355
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:35,231
Speaker 0: I mean you ever met an old crusty dude with a beard?

356
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:40,059
Speaker 0: if they who wants to get advice from someone else Well, the other thing someone else knows better than they know.

357
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:49,430
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna quote from this article because apparently you send an email To a lot of these people of color who are and women who are never tried to give a suggestion I'm like board game strategy to a grog Nard.

358
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:50,977
Speaker 0: They think they know best.

359
00:25:51,178 --> 00:26:01,864
Speaker 1: Yeah Quote there's a generation of new Hugo finalists who are exciting to the nominators, but completely unfamiliar To the attendees.

360
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:09,040
Speaker 1: So the one of their core arguments was the white dudes who come to Worldcon Don't care about all that content.

361
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:12,677
Speaker 1: so the convention has to cater to the people who actually attend.

362
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 1: but That is why so many anime cons have such shit programming because they cater to the status starting our own convention.

363
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,119
Speaker 0: Let's just get a bunch of money and buy Worldcon.

364
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,011
Speaker 0: Whoever like it has to be owned by someone.

365
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:24,776
Speaker 0: we can just buy it.

366
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:25,359
Speaker 0: They have a price.

367
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,059
Speaker 0: Let's buy the whole thing and rescue it.

368
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,640
Speaker 0: I know of two and we can piggyback on it's like it's like legacy.

369
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,932
Speaker 0: I know of other conventions and then we can just get.

370
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:39,772
Speaker 0: you don't even have to run it because we're white dudes We should find some not white not dudes to run it.

371
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:40,394
Speaker 0: Yeah.

372
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we can just protect it.

373
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:53,357
Speaker 1: But more importantly you got to do what pecs does or what we used to do at kinetic on and actually we did really well I think is Even though the attendees of a con say they want X they don't know shit.

374
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:54,200
Speaker 1: They don't know what they want.

375
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,549
Speaker 1: You trick them you use you.

376
00:26:56,689 --> 00:27:01,487
Speaker 1: it's top down at conventions the people who run the convention Set the tone and set the stage.

377
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:04,436
Speaker 1: if they schedule things they can make those things.

378
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:07,106
Speaker 0: It's not just conventions You know, it's all everything in life.

379
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:08,271
Speaker 0: You tell people what they want.

380
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:10,440
Speaker 0: You make people want what you want them to want.

381
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:23,159
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day, so Mike Tyson's punch-out is a super good game that I like.

382
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,450
Speaker 1: but one you do one funny thing about it.

383
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,310
Speaker 1: Well, two funny things about it.

384
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:48,105
Speaker 1: So one the Nintendo Entertainment System like the NES its core system if you don't put special chips in the cartridges It's not really actually more powerful than an Atari 7800 like they're similarly powered equipment and Early NES games aren't really better than Atari 7800 games.

385
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:59,970
Speaker 1: But then they did this thing with these MMC chips these memory mappers and there's this whole story of like the MMC 3.1 and the MMC 3 and how they could make different games that did different cool things.

386
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,419
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's why the NES was able to live so long right?

387
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:11,910
Speaker 0: the NES that at the beginning had games like baseball Yeah And then it also had games like Kirby's adventure and Mario 3 and it's like how did that same console do both of those games?

388
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,021
Speaker 1: And the answer is you just put more chips in the cartridge.

389
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:15,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically right.

390
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,092
Speaker 0: It's like.

391
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:23,582
Speaker 0: that's why the NES could live so long whereas, you know other systems I had pretty much like the same shit going on from beginning to end.

392
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:25,990
Speaker 1: but there's this special of all those chips.

393
00:28:26,552 --> 00:28:35,057
Speaker 1: The MMC 2 was special because only one game ever used it because I think there were more than one one game Mike Tyson's punch-out.

394
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,483
Speaker 0: and even if you were a kid not knowing anything about technology You knew that punch-out was just different from all the other Nintendo games.

395
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:42,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of it is tell.

396
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it did.

397
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,770
Speaker 1: there's a lot of weird stuff with Mike Tyson's punch-out.

398
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:56,490
Speaker 1: But one of the cool things about it is that there's this crowd in the background Like this giant kind of dynamic crowd that's moving around and sharing and stuff and people are good at the game.

399
00:28:57,012 --> 00:28:59,584
Speaker 1: The crowd's movement and react and the things they do.

400
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:11,844
Speaker 1: like someone takes a picture Someone reacts in the crowd a camera flash at like those kinds of things In the early parts of the game the fighter himself like the guy you're punching to death Would like twitch before he punched you.

401
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:12,750
Speaker 1: and that's how you play the game.

402
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,770
Speaker 1: But later the only way to predict what they were gonna do is to notice these cues from the crowd.

403
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:19,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because RNG.

404
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:24,432
Speaker 0: but you can tell what the RNG seed is based on what the crowd is doing because they only got one RNG seed.

405
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:33,309
Speaker 1: it was arguably on purpose to to provide this sort of natural feedback mechanism to make the game difficult But also make it so that you could naturally start to figure things out.

406
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:38,830
Speaker 1: But there's one dude in the background wearing sunglasses who just sits there.

407
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:47,159
Speaker 1: He only sits in one spot like he's not copied never does anything in the whole game Except in one fight against one person.

408
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:59,910
Speaker 1: There's one move where he will lower his sunglasses and go oh Right before a thing happens, and if you just so happen to punch at the moment He does that with frame perfect timing.

409
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:14,039
Speaker 1: He will never put his sunglasses back up and in fact the crowd freezes and it turns out that if the crowd freezes the game freezes and once you win or lose this fight the game soft locks and Cannot be continued.

410
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:17,959
Speaker 1: and if you lost the fight macho man Just keeps twitching his pecs forever.

411
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:20,110
Speaker 1: and this video explains in detail.

412
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, super macho man.

413
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,499
Speaker 0: Not regular macho man is Randy Savage Snap into a slim Jim?

414
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,008
Speaker 0: super macho man is a different person.

415
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:34,769
Speaker 1: yes So this video is a pretty good explanation in three minutes of how and why this happened and how they fixed it.

416
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:35,110
Speaker 1: and how they?

417
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,025
Speaker 1: Fixed it is pretty funny.

418
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:43,020
Speaker 0: So you got a thing of the day yeah, so you know ever I think most at least english-speaking children right.

419
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:47,755
Speaker 0: they they learned at the foot of the doctor Seuss not dr.

420
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:48,116
Speaker 1: Sweet.

421
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:48,739
Speaker 0: no dr.

422
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,804
Speaker 1: Seuss with the grown-up beats.

423
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:54,202
Speaker 0: It's a cat in the Hat yeah And the ham and the egg anyway my favorite dr.

424
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:54,443
Speaker 0: Seuss.

425
00:30:54,463 --> 00:30:55,026
Speaker 0: I don't know about you.

426
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:55,728
Speaker 0: What's your favorite dr.

427
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:55,889
Speaker 0: Seuss?

428
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:00,012
Speaker 1: You know it's really hard to say oh My god.

429
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,203
Speaker 1: I think I actually like the Lorax the most.

430
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:03,610
Speaker 0: my favorite is also Lorax.

431
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:06,019
Speaker 0: I'm mostly right why.

432
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:10,416
Speaker 0: because he speaks for the trees and there's also those animated Lorax Which is totally creepy.

433
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:12,706
Speaker 1: yeah, but I really liked it because of how creepy it was.

434
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,590
Speaker 0: I love that Lorax.

435
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,050
Speaker 0: I love the book Lorax and the movie Lord.

436
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:23,315
Speaker 1: I also really like the what the switcheroo machine the one with the stars on the chests and The non stars on the chests.

437
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,502
Speaker 1: I don't know you don't remember that one.

438
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,629
Speaker 0: No anyway Lorax is number one dr.

439
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,612
Speaker 0: Seuss book.

440
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:32,963
Speaker 0: there is if you ask Scott anyway, so here is an article and what the hell's.

441
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:52,305
Speaker 0: this is like a real like journal of Ecology or something right and it's written by a bunch of anthropologists, and they are basically provide this incredible You know very well supported scientific Anthropological argument that the Lorax is probably the specific kind of monkey.

442
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:53,729
Speaker 0: because what happened is dr.

443
00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:01,582
Speaker 0: Seuss apparently had writer's block around what like 1970 something and Went to some like place in Kenya.

444
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:08,068
Speaker 0: and when he was in the place in Kenya He was bored and wrote like 90% of the Lorax in like one night or something like that.

445
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:18,449
Speaker 0: and the Lorax and the the trees the tuff of the trees from the Lorax have great resemblance to specific monkey and specific kind of tree from Kenya.

446
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,353
Speaker 0: and Yeah, that's pretty cool.

447
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:22,095
Speaker 1: This goes into.

448
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:36,595
Speaker 0: somebody would care about it that much this goes into in such shocking detail in such serious scientific evaluation Just like it's not just like a tweet like yo, I'm pretty you know check it out It's sort of like whoa.

449
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:39,529
Speaker 0: you wrote a whole scientific journal article about this.

450
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,355
Speaker 1: Why it's pretty good.

451
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:48,683
Speaker 1: Yeah in the meta moment if you're a fan of the geek nice book club You might be happy to know that we talked about Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's Odyssey.

452
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,809
Speaker 1: I'm just waiting for Scott to pick the next book.

453
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:52,470
Speaker 1: And depending on what?

454
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,575
Speaker 1: Depending on what he picks.

455
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:59,280
Speaker 1: because Scott said something to me the other day and what he said was I feel like I should pick A bad book.

456
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:06,879
Speaker 1: no Cuz all I'm gonna say is that if you pick the wrong book I'm going into the forgotten realms with the next book.

457
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,203
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what actually you know.

458
00:33:08,243 --> 00:33:14,738
Speaker 0: you see you always used to threaten to go to Senor God I can and send your mouth.

459
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,243
Speaker 0: No you always threatened to go.

460
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,428
Speaker 1: Oh yeah to do ma.

461
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:22,686
Speaker 1: yes I kind of I'm kind of feeling reading the account of Monte Cristo again.

462
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:23,650
Speaker 1: that good translation, right?

463
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,049
Speaker 0: But you know a forgotten realms as bad as it would be it is short.

464
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:31,959
Speaker 0: It would take me like a day to read about how minster actually If I follow my rule of picking.

465
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:37,183
Speaker 1: I'm glad that you were actually actually able to name two things from Forgotten Realms.

466
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:39,251
Speaker 0: there was also the guy you hate with the two Swords.

467
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:41,920
Speaker 1: Oh drizz door and fuck those drizz books.

468
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:47,369
Speaker 1: if you there's a hierarchy of people who like Forgotten Realms There's the quote unquote good books.

469
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:54,950
Speaker 0: Then we all know that if you pick a Forgotten Realms book It's gonna be a froufrou elf book with some elven bard sword guy.

470
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're basically called elven bard sword.

471
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,917
Speaker 0: yeah That's what rim played.

472
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:02,523
Speaker 0: That's what I played.

473
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:03,347
Speaker 1: That's what I read.

474
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,090
Speaker 0: That's who you are.

475
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,146
Speaker 1: That's the top tier though the Volo stuff is pretty fun and also Volo not Volo.

476
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,138
Speaker 1: But the tier under that is drizz.

477
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:14,599
Speaker 1: drizz.

478
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,087
Speaker 1: like when I was 14 and these books were the best I looked down on the drizz kids like I. what are you reading?

479
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:20,489
Speaker 1: this dreck?

480
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:26,147
Speaker 1: I'm reading this high-caliber elven bard shit, and you're reading about this dark elf who's so dark.

481
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,250
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

482
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:29,768
Speaker 0: At least can we read like a mind flayer book or something?

483
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:34,224
Speaker 1: But then there's a tier below that and the tier below that is the clerics quintet.

484
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:35,909
Speaker 1: I would not make you read that.

485
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:42,549
Speaker 1: Hold it book about a beholder or something That'd be like pool of radiance style, which is also not actually good.

486
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,166
Speaker 0: I mean none of its good right.

487
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:52,737
Speaker 1: actually though I'd probably pick a planescape book cuz if I had to pick the best D&D book ever It's probably pages of pain, which is well.

488
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:55,493
Speaker 0: I mean isn't the best game the Planescape torment?

489
00:34:55,533 --> 00:35:01,410
Speaker 1: yes, so please gave torment and the book pages of pain are very similar and adjacent to one another.

490
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,839
Speaker 0: It starts with some dude waking up being like what the fuck is going.

491
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,908
Speaker 1: basically yes, and it actually is.

492
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:13,541
Speaker 0: it actually plans get tournament and just the Torment tournament and torment just the video game version of that book.

493
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:17,050
Speaker 1: so it is adjacent to our car recent book club as well.

494
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:21,487
Speaker 0: Get into some Greek myth, it's a oh I figured out what book it's gonna be.

495
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,255
Speaker 1: oh you figured it out You can reveal now.

496
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,361
Speaker 0: You're gonna wait till next episode.

497
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:24,623
Speaker 0: Okay.

498
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:25,186
Speaker 1: That's fine.

499
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:35,832
Speaker 1: otherwise Because you're listening to this episode of geek nights You're obviously a fan of our anime reviews, or you got tricked because we're but we did already Review.

500
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:38,161
Speaker 1: the show we're about to talk about on.

501
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:40,690
Speaker 1: geek nights judges anime by its cover our YouTube show.

502
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,670
Speaker 1: That is on YouTube right now.

503
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:52,489
Speaker 1: You can go watch it so you can both listen to our review of this anime Before we watched it and now you're about to listen to our review after we watch three episodes mm-hmm.

504
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,704
Speaker 1: So yeah, let's get right into it.

505
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,711
Speaker 1: I think So.

506
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,719
Speaker 1: cells at work right.

507
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,190
Speaker 0: so I actually knew about this before the judging a little bit.

508
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,973
Speaker 0: There's basically.

509
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:04,519
Speaker 0: I don't know if I think it's a manga right.

510
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:06,006
Speaker 1: it is based on a manga right.

511
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:09,401
Speaker 1: so that what it is A shonen manga that runs in.

512
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:11,069
Speaker 1: let's see kodansha.

513
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:17,887
Speaker 0: I feel like there have been other things started in 2015. other anime and manga in this genre before.

514
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:21,335
Speaker 1: well wait the genre of Gajinka or the genre of like.

515
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:24,104
Speaker 1: let's go inside the body and see what it's not.

516
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:26,090
Speaker 0: it's almost two different genres, right?

517
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:31,608
Speaker 0: There's the one genre of the sort of Educational anime manga such as muyashiman where it's like.

518
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:43,877
Speaker 0: okay You know this is an anime manga with sort of a normal generic plot But we're gonna spend a lot of time educating you about a thing right, but educating you in a Extremely superficial manner right.

519
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:48,132
Speaker 0: well somewhat super well yashiman is pretty goddamn superficial You know.

520
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:48,473
Speaker 0: it's like.

521
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:51,804
Speaker 0: the amount of education you get varies a lot right you could say.

522
00:36:51,864 --> 00:37:04,450
Speaker 0: initially educates you about cars But actually As Awful as it is I'm gonna make a true statement.

523
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:08,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, is that true bra teaches you more about underwear than initial D. Teaches you about cars.

524
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:11,394
Speaker 1: that is both awful and 100% accurate.

525
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,021
Speaker 0: So there's the educational aspect, but then there's also the okay.

526
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,447
Speaker 0: take a thing that is not a whole system.

527
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:25,474
Speaker 0: That is not people and Personify it right.

528
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:30,727
Speaker 1: so basically make it an analogy to teach you about the thing, but also be entertaining right.

529
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:38,704
Speaker 0: so instead of showing You you know just an educational film about the human body It's like well all red blood cells will be characters all white blood cells be characters.

530
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:40,149
Speaker 0: all the platelets would be characters.

531
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:40,771
Speaker 0: all that Right.

532
00:37:40,791 --> 00:38:00,246
Speaker 0: well turn all the cells in the human body into characters and put them in a world You know that looks like a fantasy world civilization city kind of place complex you know and Have them behave in such a way that matches the way the human body works to some extent You know and such-and-such.

533
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:07,026
Speaker 1: so the Yeah, so the show basically follows this red blood cell who follows the trope of.

534
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:10,730
Speaker 1: she gets lost all the time Which just gives us an excuse to see all these different.

535
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,480
Speaker 0: It's really easy sort of trope of like.

536
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:15,990
Speaker 0: okay in the first episode you want to sort of show you around.

537
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:20,070
Speaker 0: Have you meet all these characters at least for one second each show you all the parts of the body.

538
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,999
Speaker 0: We'll have the red blood cell get lost.

539
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,285
Speaker 0: and then the second episode.

540
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:24,370
Speaker 0: I didn't watch the third episode.

541
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,354
Speaker 0: There's only three episodes.

542
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:28,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only watched a little bit of the third episode because I just start doing this show.

543
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:31,194
Speaker 1: yeah Well, there's only three out.

544
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,822
Speaker 1: like the fourth one food poisoning isn't even out yet right.

545
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:45,219
Speaker 0: and basically that each episode the plot is Red blood cell gets lost red blood cell encounters some harm that is coming to the body White blood cell and she has a crush on.

546
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,959
Speaker 0: yes and a white blood cell and many other cells Come to the rescue and solve the problem.

547
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:52,384
Speaker 0: restoring health to the body.

548
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:54,310
Speaker 0: yeah, and then there's another episode.

549
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,413
Speaker 0: It's completely episodic.

550
00:38:55,433 --> 00:39:00,528
Speaker 0: There is no connection between the episodes other than recognizing the characters at least so far.

551
00:39:00,748 --> 00:39:03,660
Speaker 1: the one connection I can point out is that whatever body.

552
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,870
Speaker 1: This is is not doing well.

553
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:16,273
Speaker 0: No, they in episode one they let you know that the body is immunocompromised To some extent and then doesn't seem to have hemophilia, but it has a shortage of Episode one.

554
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:18,900
Speaker 1: I think you guys want like pneumonia the person.

555
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:20,726
Speaker 1: episode two they get a big old cut.

556
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:21,909
Speaker 1: all this bacteria comes in.

557
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:24,424
Speaker 0: Didn't put on any neosporin or band-aid.

558
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:25,230
Speaker 0: what the fuck's wrong with you?

559
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,860
Speaker 1: Flu is episode three and episode four is food poisoning.

560
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,450
Speaker 1: so I suspect this person is making poor choices.

561
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,558
Speaker 0: I hope you get some poop in episode four.

562
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:33,762
Speaker 1: I think we definitely will.

563
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:35,408
Speaker 1: there's gonna be some poop poisoning.

564
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:41,310
Speaker 1: But the thing I like this show like I'm actually gonna keep watching it like it's not.

565
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:44,425
Speaker 1: It is definitely better than attack on Titan.

566
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:48,210
Speaker 1: yeah sure because things actually happen like.

567
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:54,310
Speaker 1: Shows like this can very easily be very bland and very surface level and like not go anywhere.

568
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,076
Speaker 1: But they actually.

569
00:39:56,096 --> 00:40:00,510
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna speak to the accuracy of the analogies to any significant.

570
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,113
Speaker 0: It's what the hell do I know about biology, but the basics way less I know.

571
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:05,543
Speaker 0: I know even less than this show is teaching.

572
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:14,290
Speaker 1: this show is Deeply Invested in making the analogies way more complex than you would expect.

573
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:19,400
Speaker 1: Like it goes way Deeper like I'm not saying they try to teach you words.

574
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:29,766
Speaker 0: like they try to teach you about the different types of white blood cells Like oh, that's a lymphocyte and that one's a killer Macrophage that one's a macrophage, and it's shockingly detailed in that regard.

575
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:37,569
Speaker 1: like I like how the platelets Cute little kids and everyone when the show tries real hard to be cute And it kind of works because they are really cute like you things.

576
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:45,914
Speaker 1: But I think that the most interesting part of this is that it also doesn't go out of its way to Overexplain things like.

577
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:50,448
Speaker 0: the analogies will just sort of fit so that you are gonna be a super stickler about like.

578
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:57,489
Speaker 0: if you actually know Anything about biology and you're one of those people who's like it's not exactly really accurate well You're gonna be pissed off at this show.

579
00:40:57,871 --> 00:41:01,422
Speaker 1: But it's also way more accurate than you would otherwise expect.

580
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:15,990
Speaker 1: yes in like there's a naive White blood cell like a naive T Cell in episode 3 and he's scared doesn't know what to do and then a dendrite cell is like listen, dude It's okay And he tells him what to do and then he evolves into the like the right cat like it.

581
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,009
Speaker 1: That's kind of what happens in the immune system.

582
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:18,932
Speaker 1: Like.

583
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:30,890
Speaker 1: it follows that to a pretty deep level, but it also it'll use proper nouns in a plausible context But it won't then always just have a character explained like the spleen is where X happens.

584
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,030
Speaker 1: It sort of lets you the viewer figure these things out on your own.

585
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:44,578
Speaker 1: I actually really appreciate that because in the first episode the red blood cell gets lost and she accidentally goes into the spleen and There's this very tranquil looking woman.

586
00:41:44,598 --> 00:41:46,283
Speaker 1: Who's like may I help you?

587
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,389
Speaker 1: and she's like I think I'm lost.

588
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:51,221
Speaker 1: she's like yeah I think you are and the red blood cell leaves.

589
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:58,610
Speaker 1: and that's really funny Because the spleen basically destroys old red blood cells and recycles their parts.

590
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,759
Speaker 1: So the red blood cell wandering in there.

591
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:03,188
Speaker 1: that was funny and I feel like that's gonna come back later.

592
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:12,110
Speaker 1: But the show like a less well-done show would have explained what the spleen does right there and instead of being funny You just would have dragged out this boring.

593
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:21,270
Speaker 0: In episode 2 the cute platelets make a big like a mesh Yeah to cover up the wound and then all the cells get stuck on it and make a big scam.

594
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:25,387
Speaker 0: It's like oh my god, we're stuck here like yeah, you be stuck here for like three days.

595
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:29,078
Speaker 1: Yep But I actually like to show like.

596
00:42:29,118 --> 00:42:30,003
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep watching it.

597
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,410
Speaker 1: it's cute it's light-hearted.

598
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:37,054
Speaker 0: It's not like the kind of show that I'm gonna watch religiously like if I'm not gonna like be like, oh my god Is there a new episode?

599
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:39,729
Speaker 0: I gotta watch it right away, but it's sort of like I watch this.

600
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:43,400
Speaker 1: Why not if I'm sitting around not doing much this you show.

601
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,170
Speaker 0: there's worse things you could watch like more attack on Titan.

602
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:56,496
Speaker 1: Okay, I really like to tag on Titan but more happens in one episode of this show that happened in like the last Five episodes of attack on time.

603
00:42:56,516 --> 00:43:00,088
Speaker 0: There's only one thing in the show that super super bothers me a lot.

604
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:00,973
Speaker 1: All right I'm curious.

605
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:02,648
Speaker 0: So basically you sort of have this.

606
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:08,870
Speaker 0: One thing that bothers me only a little bit is that even though you got this biological aspect going on?

607
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:18,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show really is just sort of a generic monster of the week or that some bacteria or virus or whatever To be fair really how our bodies are.

608
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:20,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just fighting something every episode, right?

609
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,670
Speaker 0: It's still like a monster of the week.

610
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:23,738
Speaker 1: It's a shonen show.

611
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:30,150
Speaker 1: the fighting is actually pretty well done Like the white blood cell just fucking carries a knife and stabs him to death like it's pretty yeah.

612
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:35,350
Speaker 0: But the thing that gets me the most is that in those fight scenes I think Emily's bothered by the same thing.

613
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,416
Speaker 0: I think you're gonna say the white blood cell cuts up some bacteria Which is the monster with this knife?

614
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:41,981
Speaker 1: and what comes out of that monster?

615
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:44,770
Speaker 0: and then the white blood cell is then covered in blood.

616
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah, wait, so wait.

617
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:53,463
Speaker 0: Hey, yeah How does this is that blood that is on the white blood cell itself?

618
00:43:53,684 --> 00:43:56,110
Speaker 0: a whole bunch of even more?

619
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,939
Speaker 0: Microscopic cells that are themselves personified.

620
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:03,087
Speaker 0: if we were to zoom in even more I have two things to say about that.

621
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:06,700
Speaker 1: cuz Emily How the fuck does that work?

622
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,990
Speaker 1: we were watching it together and Emmett's no goddamn Every time he stabbed a motherfucker Emily was like that doesn't make.

623
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:21,109
Speaker 1: Well Here are the two things I would say about that.

624
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:35,257
Speaker 1: So one thing I would say is that in the fiction of this world, maybe the cells watch an anime about Smaller cells and all the things that make up bacteria and viruses and there's little dudes running around But you know what.

625
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:43,902
Speaker 0: even if they do it's not blood - you were the size of bacteria So to cut one red stuff wouldn't come out at no point.

626
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:46,148
Speaker 1: Did they did anyone say that was blood?

627
00:44:46,368 --> 00:44:48,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did Pretty sure.

628
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:50,641
Speaker 0: I saw a subtitle that was like, oh you got blood on you.

629
00:44:51,323 --> 00:45:00,019
Speaker 1: I would argue that that is cytoplasm from the destroyed bacteria or the Stuff that's inside of a virus.

630
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,464
Speaker 0: cytoplasm would not.

631
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04,653
Speaker 0: if they were that small Cytoplasm wouldn't be like that.

632
00:45:04,693 --> 00:45:08,363
Speaker 0: They'd actually be able to see the components, right?

633
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:09,005
Speaker 1: What do you think?

634
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:10,710
Speaker 0: cytoplasm is just goop?

635
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,754
Speaker 1: Kinda, there's a structure.

636
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:13,516
Speaker 1: There's like a skeleton.

637
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:17,790
Speaker 0: if you were that small that you were a cell you could see molecules like individual ones.

638
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:23,384
Speaker 1: I think you underestimate or overestimate the smallness of those molecules.

639
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:34,929
Speaker 1: I'm going with the fact that that is cytoplasm and Remnants of proteins from the lysing or whatever that happened to those cells and I'm confident that that is how that fiction is gonna work and I'm just gonna let it go.

640
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,109
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that that's kind of messed up.

641
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,464
Speaker 0: Why they made was a conscious choice to put that there because it's in every episode this happens.

642
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:49,050
Speaker 0: also, you know the All the bacterias are just like monsters and they're dragon ball monsters and I love that.

643
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,769
Speaker 0: No, but there seems to be some connection between them like in the second episode when the bacteria the pneumonia comes.

644
00:45:54,789 --> 00:46:00,870
Speaker 0: they're like It's like they knew the ones that came in the earlier episode and got killed like there's some relation between them.

645
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:08,290
Speaker 0: Well again, I think the person that this show is about is there some like boss bacteria that's outside waiting just to get this body.

646
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:15,538
Speaker 1: I feel like the only fiction that makes sense is that the body this is in is actually the body of that hobo in the Santa Claus out.

647
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:16,670
Speaker 0: I think this body more.

648
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:23,229
Speaker 0: I think the body is in a hospital which is the only way that would explain it like having the same Bacterias keep coming at it all the time.

649
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:28,512
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go with the fact that this canonical is linked to Rick and Morty and it's that hobo There's.

650
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:31,670
Speaker 1: there's a whole episode in that show where basically they make Jurassic Park.

651
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,801
Speaker 0: It's the hobo get a pneumonia and then an abrasion and then a food poisoning.

652
00:46:35,082 --> 00:46:45,450
Speaker 1: actually kinda the the hobo is basically the host of Jurassic Park and you shrink down and go into Jurassic Park, but instead of dinosaurs, it's inside of the body.

653
00:46:45,872 --> 00:46:51,703
Speaker 1: So and it's kind there is heavy Adjacency between that episode of Rick and Morty.

654
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:52,950
Speaker 1: in this anime is all I'm saying.

655
00:46:53,233 --> 00:46:54,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it would make sense.

656
00:46:55,874 --> 00:47:02,544
Speaker 0: I feel like if you're a person who's just like an anime fan who watches a lot of anime This is probably gonna be like a show.

657
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:03,770
Speaker 0: that's on your list for this season.

658
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,576
Speaker 1: I still ran the RIT anime club.

659
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:08,305
Speaker 1: the second the fourth episode was out.

660
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,710
Speaker 1: We would show this at the club.

661
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, this would be a no-brainer.

662
00:47:11,157 --> 00:47:13,589
Speaker 0: We would show the show right but isn't a anime.

663
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:16,254
Speaker 0: It's like a B anime.

664
00:47:16,816 --> 00:47:26,910
Speaker 1: it's like if scrap princess is a B plus this is a B and in my mind B means Solidly solidly entertaining, but I won't go out of my way to watch it if I have something better to watch.

665
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:31,470
Speaker 0: I think what it is is that it's so light is that it's almost like convenient which is a benefit.

666
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:37,724
Speaker 1: But it also moves because a lot of shows that are light like my Ashiman as much as I wanted to like it I got bored by it.

667
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,415
Speaker 0: It's not a lot happens.

668
00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:47,010
Speaker 0: But the thing is it doesn't happen because it's so light and episodic It doesn't have any sort of anything important or big tying it together.

669
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:49,229
Speaker 0: Well, so it's like it's only three episodes, right?

670
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,872
Speaker 0: But there isn't he.

671
00:47:49,892 --> 00:47:50,554
Speaker 0: there's nothing to like.

672
00:47:50,674 --> 00:47:52,380
Speaker 0: care about the old like.

673
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,450
Speaker 0: literally the only plot is what the the red blood cell love.

674
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,770
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I literally don't care if the red blood cell dies.

675
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:02,250
Speaker 1: No, all I want to see are individual scenes of the cells in a ride.

676
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,460
Speaker 0: There is no big plot to care about.

677
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:05,706
Speaker 0: so there's no like investment.

678
00:48:06,168 --> 00:48:07,656
Speaker 1: Let's see I'm gonna show the door bad.

679
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,429
Speaker 1: Okay, so here are the names of the manga volumes in order?

680
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,670
Speaker 1: Pneumonococcus Cedar pollen allergy, that's very Japanese.

681
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,490
Speaker 1: influenza scrape wound food poisoning.

682
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:30,790
Speaker 1: So I guess I skipped over the allergy one for the episode which I guess makes sense though I because I guess mast cells and all that would come up in there Erythroblasts and yellow sites what?

683
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,174
Speaker 1: Cancer cells part one.

684
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,321
Speaker 1: Oh cancer cells part two.

685
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:36,745
Speaker 0: This person's definitely in the hospital.

686
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew that.

687
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:43,639
Speaker 1: Wow Wow the H. Pylori Antigenic shift this cancers.

688
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,270
Speaker 1: There's a further cancer cell arc later.

689
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:49,280
Speaker 1: I feel like this person is not gonna make it.

690
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:51,087
Speaker 0: No, they're already immunocompromised.

691
00:48:51,127 --> 00:49:04,564
Speaker 1: on that episode one I told you if this show ends Eventually with the person's dead and like social order breaking down and it turns into Mad Max inside of this rotting body I will turn this into an a-minus anime.

692
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,358
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah All the bacteria come in and win the end.

693
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:10,505
Speaker 1: cuz shows like this never go there.

694
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:16,604
Speaker 0: if this shows the app I said apocalypse like a regular real anime where everyone dies at the end if this show goes there.

695
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,903
Speaker 1: I'm telling you a - anime That would be super cool.

696
00:49:20,943 --> 00:49:21,609
Speaker 1: That would be great.

697
00:49:27,543 --> 00:49:30,080
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

698
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,900
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
