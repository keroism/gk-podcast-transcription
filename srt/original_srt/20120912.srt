1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,754
Speaker 1: It's geek nights.

2
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:11,897
Speaker 1: I'm Greg.

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,043
Speaker 0: I'm Jennifer and tonight.

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,610
Speaker 1: We'll be talking about all the I works.

5
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:22,965
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:32,485
Speaker 1: So yeah, we don't know when rim is going to release this.

7
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:38,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, we we answered his call for people to do podcasts to fill in.

8
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:48,369
Speaker 0: So here we are a little bit more about us during the meta moment but We're here and we're recording at some point.

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:58,163
Speaker 0: actually, it's It's Independence Day the real one the real American Independence Day in other words September 3rd September 3rd.

10
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:06,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when the Treaty of Paris which ended the Revolutionary War and recognized America as a sovereign nation was signed.

11
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:13,575
Speaker 0: So citizens of the United States of America if you are celebrating your independence on July 4th You are doing it wrong.

12
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:14,097
Speaker 1: Yep.

13
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:16,790
Speaker 1: That was just a bunch of old white dudes signing a piece of paper.

14
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:22,650
Speaker 0: Well, you know in all fairness the Treaty of Paris was also a bunch of old white dudes signing a piece of paper.

15
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,193
Speaker 0: It was just more important much more Enforceable.

16
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:26,777
Speaker 0: it was paper.

17
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:33,549
Speaker 1: It was a piece of paper Forged by the deaths of thousands exactly as opposed to.

18
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:37,601
Speaker 0: hey This is our opinion about what our Declaration of Independence is all about.

19
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:38,102
Speaker 0: Yeah.

20
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:42,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also happens to be Labor Day Mmm Today.

21
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:55,040
Speaker 0: yes, because it doesn't always match up exactly because in the United States Labor Day is the first Monday of September As opposed to much of the rest of the world which celebrates International Workers Day on May 1st.

22
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,538
Speaker 1: Is there historical significance behind that?

23
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:04,270
Speaker 0: oh You know, I'll bet there is and I do not know the association.

24
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:11,549
Speaker 1: Generally, you can assume that if it if it is on a specific day It has a historical significance.

25
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:17,919
Speaker 0: Usually although I'm suspicious of the fact that it's May 1st That it's like the first of the month.

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,892
Speaker 0: That's Well, whatever.

27
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,280
Speaker 1: Well, it could be it could be something that was scheduled.

28
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:26,614
Speaker 1: true cuz I mean like, okay Maybe it was a protest.

29
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:33,373
Speaker 1: Maybe it was some big protest in the streets that brought about radical change in Policy.

30
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:34,457
Speaker 0: Well, what do you say?

31
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,530
Speaker 0: I google that while we start into gigabytes?

32
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,035
Speaker 0: So, all right Go do a gigabyte first.

33
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:53,408
Speaker 1: you've decided not to do news because by the time you hear this the news will be old and stale Like to the point where you're like really that was news at some point Or to the point where you actually didn't know that it happened because it was so old.

34
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:59,910
Speaker 1: But instead we're doing gigabytes and my gigabyte is kind of weird.

35
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,389
Speaker 1: I watched all this in World War two.

36
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:10,349
Speaker 1: Ah Which is a movie that only barely exists.

37
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:22,238
Speaker 1: it was made in 76 and is the story of World War two as told by news.

38
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:35,089
Speaker 1: footage movies and The Beatles Cover songs, yes covers covers of Beatles best Beatles covers you've ever heard ever ever ever.

39
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:37,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting the story behind that.

40
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:42,050
Speaker 1: because Fox was spending no money on this because they already had the rights.

41
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:49,070
Speaker 1: Well, not absolutely no money But pretty much no money because they already had the rights to all the footage and they didn't need to shoot anything.

42
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:53,837
Speaker 1: So They just had to pay for editing.

43
00:03:54,138 --> 00:04:09,460
Speaker 1: So they decided to license people to Cover the Beatles so that they could sell the soundtrack Which ended up being the only thing that made money because it was the 70s and People did not want to go see a war movie.

44
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,870
Speaker 0: Well, and the movie was marketed all wrong.

45
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:15,841
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the movie was just marketed all wrong.

46
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:17,485
Speaker 1: I think that's just the 70s.

47
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:20,028
Speaker 0: I Think that's some of it.

48
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:23,180
Speaker 1: Movies in the 70s just kind of were advertised like that.

49
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:23,662
Speaker 0: Also.

50
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:24,946
Speaker 0: This was an art film.

51
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:31,483
Speaker 0: This was not Potential blockbuster and it was marketed like a blockbuster, but it was released with.

52
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,188
Speaker 1: it was given a major release.

53
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:54,065
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely, and it was in the theaters for two weeks and Then it left theaters never to be heard from again except for rare showings at Film festivals and and TV.

54
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,690
Speaker 1: It's never gonna get a DVD release because they would have.

55
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:07,821
Speaker 1: At the time there wasn't a home video market so They didn't get the home video rights to any of the covers.

56
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the home video rights are extraordinarily complex.

57
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:22,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, just because of the number of sources of intellectual property involved They would have to they would have to go into licensing with Rod Stewart Tina Turner the moon estate the gibb estate.

58
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:24,653
Speaker 1: Mmm Oh my god, it.

59
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,857
Speaker 1: yeah, it's pretty much.

60
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:32,549
Speaker 1: and the amount of money they would demand versus the amount of money that The movie would actually make yeah.

61
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:39,812
Speaker 0: However, you can't find this on the internet either for download if you so choose or there I bootleg.

62
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:45,386
Speaker 0: you can buy a bootleg which might be convenient for you depending on the state of your home network.

63
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:59,521
Speaker 1: if you don't have if you don't have a HDMI port on your TV like ours mmm and Don't have like a ps3 or xbox.

64
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:09,844
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you're gonna want to get the bootleg Or if you just want to Support a relatively small business that does vintage films.

65
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,046
Speaker 0: I Can't remember the name of company that distributes the bootleg, but you know, I can't really get behind.

66
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:17,830
Speaker 0: not hard to find a business That sells.

67
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:20,318
Speaker 0: Okay, fair enough.

68
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:25,642
Speaker 0: All right, so I've got the history now at International Workers Day And this is shameful that we did not know this.

69
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:30,201
Speaker 0: This is absolutely shameful at least As long as Wikipedia is telling me the truth.

70
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:31,467
Speaker 1: It's the roses strike, isn't it?

71
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:39,150
Speaker 0: Nope International Workers Day according to Wikipedia is the commemoration of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago.

72
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:47,029
Speaker 0: The police were trying to disperse a public assembly during a general strike for the eight-hour workday When an unidentified person threw a bomb at them.

73
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,025
Speaker 0: Then it goes on from there.

74
00:06:50,234 --> 00:07:01,801
Speaker 0: So it's kind of police or the workers I believe at the police because the police reacted by firing on the workers Killing dozens of demonstrators and several of their own officers.

75
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,199
Speaker 1: I wonder what the NWA has to say about this NWA.

76
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:12,218
Speaker 0: NWA And with attitude Yes, well, I don't know.

77
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:14,284
Speaker 0: Oh in terms of frack the police.

78
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:18,302
Speaker 0: Yes, which I should get because I'm old But at any rate it's.

79
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:35,510
Speaker 0: it's kind of interesting that we celebrate this so little in the United States given that we are in the country where the event happened to everyone listening if you want to feel old Straight out of Compton came out in 1989.

80
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,497
Speaker 1: hmm, that was 23 years ago.

81
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:43,049
Speaker 1: I Wasn't alive.

82
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,041
Speaker 0: Yeah more about our relative ages at the metamoment.

83
00:07:47,221 --> 00:08:00,026
Speaker 0: so anyway for my geek bite I Must put in a plug for humanity has declined which is an anime Which is currently airing in Japan and it's simulcasting on crunchyroll and I'm sure there's other places.

84
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,030
Speaker 0: You can find it as well.

85
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:02,900
Speaker 0: I am enjoying it.

86
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,627
Speaker 0: It is an odd show.

87
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:17,785
Speaker 0: It's hard to even know what to say about it when when I first heard about it It was everybody talking about the fact that a piece of bread essentially commits Suicide in order to provide food for some people.

88
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:22,698
Speaker 0: and we're talking Blood everywhere as the bread is killing itself.

89
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:22,939
Speaker 0: It's.

90
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:32,390
Speaker 0: it's an odd little show in a lot of ways, but the basic Concept of it is that the last generation of human beings has been born.

91
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,481
Speaker 0: It's like the room of golf is an empty from from Ava or something.

92
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:55,510
Speaker 0: So no more human beings are being born and The new dominant species on the planet is the species of fairies and they're like maybe five or seven inches tall and It's not entirely clear to me even ten episodes in exactly where they're going with this thing.

93
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,598
Speaker 0: But that's kind of what I like about it so much.

94
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,710
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff about the fairy and human interactions.

95
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,258
Speaker 0: there's A lot of things about food.

96
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,204
Speaker 0: food is clearly playing a very important part in this show And it's just kind of got an interesting style.

97
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:22,710
Speaker 0: It's very bitter and it's very cute and That is appealing to me, but I can also see where for some people that would make it Unappealing.

98
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:43,769
Speaker 0: But yeah, so I would say check it out on crunchyroll or wherever else you may find your anime the things of the day.

99
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:58,390
Speaker 0: So since I did my first I'm gonna let you go first for the things of the day, okay Well, the thing of my day has been the thing of many of my days now actually But I do not believe it has ever been mentioned on geek nights.

100
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:03,510
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna put in a plug for a webcomic called in his likeness.

101
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,116
Speaker 0: It's grown in complexity over the years, but the basic concept is simple.

102
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:16,500
Speaker 0: All of the characters are represented by dots and It's about God and it's about the devil and it's about Neptune.

103
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,584
Speaker 0: Eventually, it's about the devil lets.

104
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:39,529
Speaker 0: sooner or later Cthulhu gets involved, but it's a very simple visual style and it's a kind of Chatty silly punny in in some corners Kind of webcomic strip the first like two or three hundred Strips are really great.

105
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:44,654
Speaker 1: I Haven't read anything in the last hundred.

106
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:47,943
Speaker 1: that was about God So I can't.

107
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:49,607
Speaker 1: I don't really like it as much.

108
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:50,128
Speaker 1: Hmm.

109
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,460
Speaker 1: He's using like Cthulhu and cats and I'm not.

110
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:56,967
Speaker 1: It feels kind of woo game ish.

111
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,807
Speaker 0: There's some God stuff that's still going on more recently but at any rate in his likeness check it out.

112
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:11,659
Speaker 1: and my thing of the day is an old classic that I was sure had been on geek nights and Discovered was not.

113
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:18,370
Speaker 1: So I'm going to cop out and use it anyway But it is the old Negro space program.

114
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:22,386
Speaker 1: Oh a not Ken Burns documentary.

115
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:35,979
Speaker 1: indeed All I'm going to say is that space is cold Almost froze my mother a freaking nuts off.

116
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,388
Speaker 1: All right, so metamoment already then.

117
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:42,570
Speaker 0: yes metamoment.

118
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:46,787
Speaker 0: So some of you know us from the front row crew forums.

119
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,929
Speaker 0: I am JTVH on the forums and Greg is Greg.

120
00:11:53,112 --> 00:12:00,310
Speaker 0: You might know us from some of the panels that we do at Anime conventions and similar conventions like Kineticon.

121
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,601
Speaker 0: You might know us as two-thirds of the family that geeks together.

122
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:07,493
Speaker 1: by the time this goes up for all we know will have been Panelists.

123
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,697
Speaker 0: who knows who knows?

124
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:10,082
Speaker 0: well hopefully we'll see.

125
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,329
Speaker 0: we'll see if Otakon wants any of our stuff next year.

126
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:25,710
Speaker 0: But at any rate we also have another project that you may not be aware of Which is I am one of the co-hosts and co-producers of a podcast called those darn cats.

127
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:51,229
Speaker 0: my co-host is my best friend Lisa and we talk about all things Disney and we touch on things from Their reviews of different Disney Cruise Line ships to a feminist analysis of Minnie's country home in Toontown in Magic Kingdom to an unfortunate lack of theming event at the Tomorrowland Noodle Terrace Which is inexplicably our most downloaded show.

128
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:59,401
Speaker 0: We did a show one time on gay days at Disney parks Which is a more inflammatory topic than one might imagine.

129
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:02,310
Speaker 0: we had different people come on as guests for that.

130
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:08,600
Speaker 0: So at any rate if you're interested in Disney stuff at all Check it out at those darn cats dotnet.

131
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,970
Speaker 1: All right, so into the main bit.

132
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,648
Speaker 1: absolutely All right, so of I works.

133
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:20,669
Speaker 1: is The man that Disney doesn't want you to know about?

134
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:24,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's the man that they want on you to think.

135
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:24,985
Speaker 1: Walt was?

136
00:13:25,266 --> 00:13:28,037
Speaker 1: he designed Mickey Mouse?

137
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,110
Speaker 1: he was an amazing.

138
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:31,970
Speaker 1: Single-handedly.

139
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:35,029
Speaker 1: It was an amazing an amazing engineer.

140
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:48,270
Speaker 1: he Went off and did his own stuff trained Chuck Jones Who is known as the director of all your favorite Warner Brothers cartoons?

141
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,669
Speaker 1: Where should we start?

142
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,494
Speaker 0: Where should we start?

143
00:13:52,514 --> 00:14:04,965
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, let me just say he's the man that Disney Kinda doesn't want you to know because he is listed as a Disney legend legends series not for any of the reasons that they don't want you to know about.

144
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:12,870
Speaker 1: the weird part is They published the book the hand behind the mouse, which is kind of what exposed is all this.

145
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,019
Speaker 1: They made it into a documentary.

146
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:27,926
Speaker 1: You can buy this documentary on the Disney Treasuries DVD which It's the Oswald collection Oswald the lucky rabbit.

147
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:34,669
Speaker 1: Yep, so They like you know about him, but it's a pain in the ass to find any of these.

148
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:41,450
Speaker 1: I Could not find any Disney Treasuries when looking for them on the Disney site.

149
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:46,609
Speaker 0: Oh, no, that's interesting because they're not hard to find at Best Buy or at least they weren't when that first came out.

150
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:52,341
Speaker 1: Yeah yeah, but like just the interface did not let me find them.

151
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:58,384
Speaker 1: I gave up and went to Google and And Googled for the product I was looking for.

152
00:14:58,404 --> 00:15:15,128
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm so they're they're willing to admit that he did this but they they're not willing to publicize him as The god he was which is a shame because he was a lot more amazing than they even let.

153
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:20,529
Speaker 1: He was a more amazing person than Walt the legend was.

154
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:28,330
Speaker 1: for example Disney in 1936 Spent seven million dollars on a multi-plane camera.

155
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:41,635
Speaker 1: The multi-plane camera is something that allows multiple cells to be used in One frame of animation which sounds like a waste of cellulite but hurt celluloid celluloid.

156
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:44,887
Speaker 0: a Waste of cellulite is a whole different topic.

157
00:15:46,580 --> 00:16:01,067
Speaker 1: Seems like waste of celluloid But what allows you to do is it allows you to move things at different rates so that Don Quixote is Moving faster than the forest is moving faster than the castle.

158
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,287
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm That's just one example.

159
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,424
Speaker 1: three years before Disney developed it of.

160
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:22,575
Speaker 1: I works at his own student as independent studio at MGM which had been founded in 1930. the studio not MGM bought a used car for under a thousand dollars and Made one out of that.

161
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:28,879
Speaker 0: Well and that it just interestingly enough that is the multi-plane camera that they talk about in the attraction.

162
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,994
Speaker 0: one Man's dream about Walt Disney.

163
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:35,399
Speaker 1: if you ever go to Disney World Go to one man's tree.

164
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,512
Speaker 1: well first read the book the hand behind the mouse because it's great book.

165
00:16:38,994 --> 00:17:07,279
Speaker 1: then go to one man's dream and Look at just how much stuff was actually done by up the multi-plane camera when he was still at in art school He invented or not quite invented, but he made a self cranking camera because in the time animation required two people one person to crank his camera and the other to feed the cells in and So he made a device that would crank the camera itself.

166
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:16,016
Speaker 1: He made huge innovations For on the mat process did special effects for the birds.

167
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,398
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Hitchcock's he developed a machine based off of xerox that got rid of in-between urs.

168
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:29,920
Speaker 1: In-between urs are animators who draw all the frames between the key animators drawing.

169
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:31,987
Speaker 0: So basically you put a lot of people out of work.

170
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:35,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was incredibly efficient.

171
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,696
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, he put a lot of people out of work, but it's also ten times more beautiful.

172
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,786
Speaker 1: Mmm, absolutely Like watch Sleeping Beauty.

173
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:53,800
Speaker 1: that's not a good movie, but it is a beautiful movie and so I like it anyway Mmm, and I've also did a bunch of work on Disney Parks attractions, too.

174
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:58,715
Speaker 0: That was later on in his career mind you that must have been in the 60s.

175
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:05,625
Speaker 0: Yep in the 60s he got involved with Disney theme park Imagineering and Played a part in developing.

176
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:06,569
Speaker 0: It's a small world.

177
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:07,573
Speaker 0: great moments with mr.

178
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:12,190
Speaker 0: Lincoln and the Hall of Presidents and The first and last of those.

179
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,840
Speaker 0: it's a small world and Hall of Presidents.

180
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:24,879
Speaker 0: They may be annoying and/or boring attractions But especially in Hall of Presidents the animatronics involved were pretty impressive for the time and they're still in use.

181
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,907
Speaker 1: Small world not so impressive animatronics.

182
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,111
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, not so much.

183
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:48,850
Speaker 1: Yeah more or less just puppets on sticks Yeah, but what I find most notable about of is his early animation When he began his career fresh out of high school or not high school art school with Walt They began the Laugh O'Grams company, which this is fun.

184
00:18:49,150 --> 00:19:03,636
Speaker 1: theaters would commission them to make music videos for regional hits which is interesting because that was something that was frequently done in like the 20s and to a lesser extent in the early 30s.

185
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:11,860
Speaker 1: But then music videos more or less disappeared until the 70s Yeah, which is kind of fascinating.

186
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:14,027
Speaker 0: Yeah with the exception of the Beatles.

187
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:18,340
Speaker 0: the Beatles actually were doing music videos at a time that nobody was doing music videos.

188
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:22,595
Speaker 1: Well, they were making movies that let them make music videos.

189
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:26,434
Speaker 1: true true fair enough I are see the monkeys were doing the same thing.

190
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:30,159
Speaker 1: Mmm So it's not like it was just the Beatles.

191
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,915
Speaker 0: True but they I think the monkeys started doing it after the Beatles but back to up.

192
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:57,539
Speaker 1: but yeah, so they making music videos and advertisements at Laugh O'Grams made the Alice comedies which were a series about a little girl played by Virginia Davis being transported into this cartoon world which Had varying quality.

193
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:16,339
Speaker 1: Mmm first one was really good everything afterwards was kind of yeah, but then they made Oswald lucky rabbit Which was licensed and distributed by mints mints industries or Corp or whatever who would later be bought by Universal Mm-hmm, and the Oswald's are really good.

194
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:20,939
Speaker 1: It's the first instance of conservation of mass.

195
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:31,010
Speaker 1: Felix the cat his legs would extend so that he could get taller and look at something But they wouldn't get thinner right exactly his.

196
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,256
Speaker 0: his amount of mass would change.

197
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:41,508
Speaker 1: It's also one of the earlier appearances of elasticity of all objects Mmm-hmm before like in the Alice comedies.

198
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:56,736
Speaker 1: if something stretched it would then just sort of go back like a telescope Right, whereas in Oswald it snaps back it like Snap and then go forward really fast.

199
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:57,118
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

200
00:20:57,944 --> 00:20:59,099
Speaker 1: And it also features a robot cow.

201
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:02,815
Speaker 0: And what's not to like about a robot cow really?

202
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:10,274
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I think the best is trolley troubles which is simply fantastic it is.

203
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:15,273
Speaker 1: indeed it also has inexplicable telescope vision.

204
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,278
Speaker 0: So, oh, yeah, this was.

205
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:31,320
Speaker 1: this was sort of a trope of the time both in animation and live-action and I don't know why but Frequently the frame will become circular with just like black around the edges.

206
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:32,664
Speaker 1: I don't know why it does this.

207
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very interesting.

208
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,313
Speaker 0: I don't know why either.

209
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:42,473
Speaker 1: if someone who knows more about silent film Could tell us yeah drop a fantastic podcast at those don't cats net.

210
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:49,904
Speaker 1: but yeah, and it's at this point that Charles Mintz fires Walt and Contracts out all the animators.

211
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:59,768
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, except for of course up because of is awesome knows that he can succeed without Pretty much anyone which was tested later.

212
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:01,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, but true.

213
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:02,297
Speaker 1: We'll get to that in a minute.

214
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:15,757
Speaker 1: So Of in Kansas City knows that Mintz has done this and is working on a solution while Walt is still in California being caught up and It's at this point.

215
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:20,812
Speaker 1: Cuz remember this is back when there weren't airplanes.

216
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:27,973
Speaker 1: I mean technically their work is Wright brothers were I'm gonna say but they were not in common usage.

217
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:35,340
Speaker 1: Yeah stretch of the imagination yeah, so people were still taking trains and trains take a long time.

218
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:45,656
Speaker 1: Walt was in California for just a few days, but it took him Like a week and a half two weeks in order to do his business.

219
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,380
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

220
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:54,664
Speaker 1: And so it's in these two weeks that of designs Mickey Mouse and draws the first cartoon playing crazy Which is about date.

221
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:55,970
Speaker 0: rape in the air.

222
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:57,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

223
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,699
Speaker 1: Yeah Which?

224
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:05,280
Speaker 1: No, no, I feel kind of bad saying this but it's also my favorite Mickey Mouse.

225
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:08,672
Speaker 0: well, it's back when I say.

226
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:17,778
Speaker 0: it's back when as if like At any rate, it was not a time when it was 1927 28 it's a different time.

227
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:19,461
Speaker 0: It's.

228
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:24,100
Speaker 0: it's at a time when Mickey was still the mischievous character because that's how he started out.

229
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:33,892
Speaker 0: he started out very mischievous and It was only when he became the corporate mascot that he had to get more wholesome And less troublemaker.

230
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:34,033
Speaker 0: II.

231
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,331
Speaker 1: his wholesomeness Begins as soon as Walt intervenes.

232
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:43,190
Speaker 1: of didn't really believe in likable protagonists.

233
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:48,475
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm He believed in a protagonist that would keep the viewers attention.

234
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:52,027
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm He probably would have done very well on South Park.

235
00:23:52,147 --> 00:24:14,680
Speaker 1: Yes, whereas Walt wanted the viewer to like The the character he was seeing he wanted them to connect with Mickey Mouse Which is why as soon as he returned to Kansas City, he had had of and Two other animators make a cartoon where Mickey abuses animals for seven.

236
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,903
Speaker 0: We are speaking, of course of the Steamboat Willie.

237
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:30,158
Speaker 1: Yes, which was released before playing crazy because they wanted to have a gimmick To draw people's attention to their new character, which was a smart business move.

238
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:34,492
Speaker 0: quite frankly Yes, nobody had done synchronized sound for a cartoon before.

239
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:35,294
Speaker 1: Yes.

240
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:42,840
Speaker 1: It's perhaps the Smartest and certainly the most important decision that Walt made in his entire career.

241
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,467
Speaker 0: Well, certainly in terms of animation stuff.

242
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:48,695
Speaker 1: Yes, and so they're released.

243
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:59,936
Speaker 1: Steamboat Willie, which is about Swinging cats around in the air and pulling on the teats of poor little piggies Yeah, and beating on the cows teeth.

244
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,977
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, it's a really really sadistic little Mickey Mouse.

245
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:17,044
Speaker 1: you got there and then like Pete throws him in the in the brig to peel potatoes and we're supposed to Dislike him for this.

246
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:20,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still don't understand why.

247
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:22,879
Speaker 1: oh and also that crane is a total perv.

248
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:24,666
Speaker 0: True true true.

249
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, everybody's just got to go watch Steamboat Willie.

250
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,220
Speaker 0: So they have any clue what we're talking about?

251
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:34,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, they also should watch plain crazy which features the earliest I've seen.

252
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:46,794
Speaker 0: Example of uses of wiener dogs Technology, I would like someone to write a book about the history of wiener dog technology in cartoons.

253
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:47,576
Speaker 1: Yes.

254
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,580
Speaker 1: Oh my god I would read that book like three times and I don't read that fast.

255
00:25:53,851 --> 00:26:03,418
Speaker 1: but Anyway, he made those and he makes the galloping Goncho or Gaucho Gaucho the galloping Groucho.

256
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:12,120
Speaker 1: That would have been good Steamboat Willie and galloping Gaucho actually are both parodies of contemporary movies.

257
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:23,445
Speaker 1: Steamboat Bill was a Big hit of the time and I don't remember what the galloping Gaucho was a parody of but I do remember it was double Douglas Fairbanks movie.

258
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:24,089
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

259
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,569
Speaker 1: Okay, Mickey was very Heavily inspired by Douglas Fairbanks.

260
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:30,557
Speaker 1: that didn't stick around.

261
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:32,959
Speaker 1: but at the beginning Mm-hmm, really?

262
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:35,869
Speaker 1: And the galloping Gaucho.

263
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:37,177
Speaker 1: I don't really have any good jokes about.

264
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:39,471
Speaker 1: I haven't seen this many times.

265
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:44,631
Speaker 1: so It's this point that Walt launches the Silly symphonies.

266
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:49,954
Speaker 0: I was going to say initiative But he begins that line of cartoons.

267
00:26:50,517 --> 00:27:04,490
Speaker 1: Yes But you know, what's just the Silly symphonies series which is where of makes my favorite cartoons From Disney save for World War two.

268
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:14,573
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm because that That's stuff like Nazi Donald and oh Hemisphere exactly the grain that changed the hemisphere though.

269
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,501
Speaker 0: They um a Packet.

270
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,206
Speaker 0: what's it called on the front lines?

271
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:23,542
Speaker 1: I think it's called on the front lines also from the Disney Treasuries Collection.

272
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:29,276
Speaker 1: the moral of the podcast is buy everything from the Disney Treasuries collection.

273
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:31,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really more interesting.

274
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,750
Speaker 0: Then one might imagine there's a lot of interesting early Disney stuff.

275
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:43,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it's from before 1950 just buy it Mmm, don't even ask questions or look on YouTube because a lot of this stuff is on YouTube.

276
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,650
Speaker 1: Yes, search YouTube for Der Führer's face.

277
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,898
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Donald in Nazi Land.

278
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,308
Speaker 1: Yep They didn't change the name because it was offensive.

279
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:56,540
Speaker 1: They changed the name because Der Führer's face was a contemporary radio hit.

280
00:27:57,182 --> 00:28:04,010
Speaker 1: Mmm, yeah, and so as a result anyone who's any buddy Says calls it Donald in Nazi Land.

281
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:06,620
Speaker 1: So uh begins work on.

282
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:10,409
Speaker 1: Probably the most famous is the skeleton dance.

283
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:21,999
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm with music by Carl Stalling who have to give a lot of credit to absolutely who is the best composer to work in the field of cartoons?

284
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,279
Speaker 1: and Sung by Thoreau Ravenscroft an amazing voice actor.

285
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:40,159
Speaker 1: Yes, amazing voice who I think our our listeners will certainly recognize him as the guy who sung Grinch Absolutely, and somehow over the course of 40 years his voice didn't change that much.

286
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:42,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, amazingly consistent over the years.

287
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:58,176
Speaker 1: yeah, and so up writes that and he also or not writes of creates that and he also Drew a less well-remembered Cartoon that I like more, but I'm not sure why which is Hell's Bells.

288
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:03,369
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Which the best way to describe it is Satan the musical.

289
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:03,850
Speaker 0: Hmm.

290
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:05,294
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good way to describe it.

291
00:29:05,855 --> 00:29:13,534
Speaker 1: It's about demons and The inferno and all this stuff and they're all smiling and why shouldn't they be?

292
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:19,099
Speaker 1: and they're all doing that thing that they did In the 30s car in the cartoons in the 30s where they're bouncing up and down.

293
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:20,777
Speaker 0: I love that.

294
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:26,340
Speaker 1: There's actually a reason for it Because they used it as a metronome basically.

295
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:38,813
Speaker 1: So the characters bounced to the beat so they could sync them up easily, but it's also really silly Exactly, and so Hell's Bells is kind of silly, but I like it.

296
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:56,838
Speaker 1: I've worked on two more cartoons with Disney the spring and summer Silly symphonies which were part of a series about seasons, but he was getting disgruntled with Walt Because Walt was me was very much streamlining the process of animation.

297
00:29:56,999 --> 00:30:04,874
Speaker 1: He was he was trying to do to animation what Henry Ford did to the car and Of didn't like that.

298
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:23,460
Speaker 1: So he was given an offer by MGM to form his own studio which he gladly accepted and He brought with him a lot of the highest talent at Disney Bob Clampett Carl Stalling and also people from other studios.

299
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:32,811
Speaker 1: Tex Avery was from I don't remember if it was Van Buren or God, I'm blanking on their name the guys who did Betty Boop.

300
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:33,775
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

301
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,179
Speaker 0: I can't remember what studio that was.

302
00:30:35,803 --> 00:30:38,000
Speaker 0: I was never a Betty Boop fan Fleischer Brothers.

303
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:48,140
Speaker 1: But yeah Tex Avery from Fleischer Brothers all these Amazing people came because they heard of I works is starting his own studio.

304
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,831
Speaker 1: Mmm, that's the biggest thing that can happen.

305
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:54,519
Speaker 1: Yep, they go to work for him and He makes cartoons.

306
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:59,132
Speaker 1: they are Interesting.

307
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:01,298
Speaker 0: balloon land is my favorite.

308
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,863
Speaker 1: You can watch them yourselves.

309
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:06,800
Speaker 1: Actually, they are on Netflix streaming Mm-hmm cartoons.

310
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,610
Speaker 1: the time forgot of I works collection.

311
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:17,292
Speaker 1: they also have the Van Buren collection on there, which I have not watched yet, but I have seen the up ones and they are Interesting.

312
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:27,597
Speaker 1: the first one or no, not the first one but first comic color was a little piece called fiddlesticks Wearing a very early flip.

313
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:37,309
Speaker 1: the frog which would become the mascot for them does dances with a Mickey Mouse ripoff Which I have mixed feelings about because he kind of made him.

314
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's kind of ripping off himself.

315
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:45,475
Speaker 0: But at the same time it's Walt's intellectual property like Well, but actually it's questionable.

316
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:51,370
Speaker 0: There are some intellectual property questions about some of the early Disney.

317
00:31:52,173 --> 00:31:56,710
Speaker 0: It may have fallen into the public domain now, but no one really wants to be the test case.

318
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:58,318
Speaker 0: So you were saying about flip?

319
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,954
Speaker 1: Yeah the flip he made series is flip the frog and Willy Whopper or The consistency.

320
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:17,840
Speaker 1: he also made a series of fairy tale adaptations which were kind of the beta testing for fractured fairy tales Mmm, the Rocky and Bullwinkle segment.

321
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:23,098
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but you got things like Humpty Dumpty Which is really silly and I really love it.

322
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,290
Speaker 1: and it has this silly song at the end about spooning in a spoon.

323
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:30,828
Speaker 0: Oh, I love the um Humpty Dumpty.

324
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,681
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, and some of the characters get hard-boiled.

325
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:38,851
Speaker 0: yeah, one of the eggs basically turns into Mae West Uh-huh.

326
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:41,659
Speaker 1: Oh and the Don Quixote adaptation.

327
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,903
Speaker 1: I simply love.

328
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:50,728
Speaker 1: but anyway, these didn't really stick around because they they didn't have.

329
00:32:52,091 --> 00:33:04,368
Speaker 1: It was the of I works philosophy of don't make a protagonist that that people root for make a protagonist that people like or no don't make a protagonist that people like make a protagonist that people pay attention to.

330
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:12,385
Speaker 1: and Because the characters didn't stick with people the same same way that Walt's Mickey did It didn't grab people as well.

331
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:14,618
Speaker 1: on Top of that.

332
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:30,724
Speaker 1: It was the Great Depression Mmm, the studio was founded in 1930 and was bought by Schlesinger Studios in Which would then be brought by the Warner Brothers and be turned into Warner Brothers animation.

333
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:36,109
Speaker 1: and on top of that Ubs cartoons were very risque.

334
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:42,270
Speaker 1: It was not odd for a pair of breasts to be featured in one of his cartoons.

335
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,742
Speaker 1: they weren't designed for children.

336
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:55,316
Speaker 1: they were designed for a businessman who was traveling through town and had five minutes to Spare and enjoy himself.

337
00:33:55,958 --> 00:34:13,149
Speaker 1: And so when the Hays code came into effect the Hays code banned Disrespect of religion races all religions authority and quote anything else.

338
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:31,139
Speaker 1: so Ubs very politically incorrect before politically incorrect was a thing Studio ran into a lot of trouble which is unfortunate because I really love flips design and So they ended up running pretty much out of money.

339
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,447
Speaker 1: So Schlesinger was able to buy them cheap.

340
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:44,829
Speaker 1: after Working for a few years at Schlesinger You can find Ubs name on one or two Warner Brothers is he returned to Disney but not as an animator.

341
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:47,909
Speaker 1: He decided that he had beat animation.

342
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:59,618
Speaker 1: He instead returned as a engineer Mm-hmm, which is where he developed the mad technology the Xerox derivative All that stuff.

343
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:01,729
Speaker 1: It was heavily involved in Mary Poppins.

344
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:12,689
Speaker 1: Yes special effects for that which seemed kind of rudimentary to us But there hadn't been live-action animation crossover in a long time.

345
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:21,256
Speaker 0: Well, and that little that little anim audio animatronic bird and Mary Poppins was actually Pretty good for its day.

346
00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:27,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, so since Greg you're more the I works expert of the two of us.

347
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:34,590
Speaker 0: It seems to me that if someone's going to If they want to learn about a buy works.

348
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:40,150
Speaker 0: Some of the best things they could do would be watch the hand behind the mouse or read the book the hand behind the mouse.

349
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:41,194
Speaker 1: The book was better.

350
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:47,749
Speaker 0: if someone was gonna just go look at one of I works Property, what would you tell them to go watch?

351
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,555
Speaker 1: Do you mean anything he's worked on?

352
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:52,044
Speaker 1: or do you mean anything from his studio anything?

353
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:58,064
Speaker 0: He's worked on Oswald lucky rabbit Mmm, and some of those are available on YouTube.

354
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:07,930
Speaker 1: I do believe yes Oswald is finally back at the Disney Company after doing nothing at Universal for a little bit under a century.

355
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:28,476
Speaker 0: Yes, and some people may remember it wasn't too long ago that Disney Traded al Michaels the sports reporter from ESPN in order to get Oswald back into the fold and the thing that they've done with Oswald subsequently that people might be familiar with is The epic Mickey series of games

356
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:32,230
Speaker 1: which are not good, but we like them anyway, because they have Oswald.

357
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:45,440
Speaker 0: Well, and I like the fact that they've actually done something to bring Oswald's back into the corporate fold and to be actually Hey, hey, they did two things They made epic Mickey and they made a plushie.

358
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:46,404
Speaker 0: That's true.

359
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:50,036
Speaker 0: And I bought both these things And a few pins in the parks.

360
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:51,842
Speaker 0: They've got a few pins of the parks here and there.

361
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:52,003
Speaker 0: Yep.

362
00:36:52,845 --> 00:37:03,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think my Favorite of I works property because I'm assuming that people have seen at least some of the vintage Disney which may or may not be correct pretty much.

363
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,530
Speaker 1: I think everyone's seen either played in crazy or steamboat Willie.

364
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:13,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you haven't you really if you're a fan of animation at all You owe it to yourself to go see that.

365
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:20,847
Speaker 0: also watch Gertie the dinosaur, but my personal favorite of I works Would have to be the Humpty Dumpty.

366
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:26,584
Speaker 0: Oh which I believe may well be on YouTube and if not, it's certainly in the.

367
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:32,160
Speaker 1: I think it's in the Film archive thing the one that's on streaming Netflix.

368
00:37:32,762 --> 00:37:34,206
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what's on streaming Netflix.

369
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:39,148
Speaker 0: Okay, so if you got Netflix It's in the cartoons the time forgot and I think that that's all.

370
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:42,533
Speaker 1: fortunately Netflix kind of screwed up Cartoons.

371
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,506
Speaker 1: the time forgot is treated as a movie, right?

372
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:54,176
Speaker 1: So that's like four hours of cartoons and No scene select or anything.

373
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:59,489
Speaker 1: You can get the discs also from Netflix, but on streaming There's no scene select.

374
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:08,260
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's worth it to deal with the fast forwarding if you want to because or you just don't fast forward and just watch Shotgun them all in an afternoon.

375
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz that's what I do.

376
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,710
Speaker 0: Cuz why not?

377
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz yeah, I love the Humpty Dumpty and I love balloon land.

378
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:19,381
Speaker 0: Balloon land is a very very strange cartoon indeed.

379
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:22,930
Speaker 1: balloon land is definitely at the end of something.

380
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:33,567
Speaker 0: Yes Not sure at the end of what but it is certainly at the end of something and I guess I should mention that up one More Academy Awards than I can even mention.

381
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:34,873
Speaker 0: Oh Absolutely.

382
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:39,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of them being for the birds the office cock property.

383
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:49,999
Speaker 1: Yes, he won one for the toy soldier cartoon that he did MGM and A million and a half for special effects.

384
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you could argue that he won one for the lifetime achievement Given to Mickey Mouse.

385
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, that really should have.

386
00:38:58,515 --> 00:38:59,983
Speaker 0: His name should have been on that thing.

387
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:02,154
Speaker 1: That's debatable Cuz.

388
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,110
Speaker 1: I've never took credit for it true?

389
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:14,490
Speaker 1: Oh very much believed that the reason that Mickey succeeded was because Walt took it away from him Mmm, and if he had continued working on it would not have been a success.

390
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:26,390
Speaker 0: Well, and you know in all honesty, he could be right about that because in my opinion Of was not quite as skilled as Walt at sort of long-term character development.

391
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:28,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could not have made a movie.

392
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,045
Speaker 0: Yes, I would have to agree.

393
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:38,450
Speaker 1: of was great at Comedy, but not character not nothing longer than like 12 minutes.

394
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, he really was not into developing the characters at all.

395
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:49,968
Speaker 0: So yeah, they which is what made them such a good team mind you given how flat Snow white was maybe he could have.

396
00:39:50,985 --> 00:40:00,270
Speaker 2: maybe This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
