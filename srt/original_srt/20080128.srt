1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,696
Speaker 0: It's Monday January 28th.

2
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:12,438
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,325
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek knives tonight.

4
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:17,349
Speaker 0: software should always get better.

5
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:30,023
Speaker 0: Let's do this Today when I got home from work.

6
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:36,934
Speaker 0: I was greeted by possibly the most wonderful thing I've seen in about five months.

7
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:44,882
Speaker 0: give or take I get off the train and there's this orb this Gigantic fiery ball and it wasn't like on the ground.

8
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:50,460
Speaker 0: It was up in the sky Like floating there and there was light coming off of it.

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,783
Speaker 0: There was light everywhere.

10
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:52,566
Speaker 0: There was light.

11
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,130
Speaker 0: I there was light outside.

12
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,898
Speaker 0: I haven't seen such a thing in many moons.

13
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,522
Speaker 1: It's been pitch black for what?

14
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:58,984
Speaker 1: how long.

15
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:11,269
Speaker 0: well considering up in the winter I get up at the crack as of before dawn and I go to work and I come home from work pretty early But not before that big fiery day star goes down.

16
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,850
Speaker 1: Well, that's cuz it's the winter and you know the daylight savings whatever time.

17
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,905
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's daylight savings time or not, but it's one of the it's.

18
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:19,770
Speaker 1: either is or it isn't.

19
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,453
Speaker 0: See, that's the one thing.

20
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:31,590
Speaker 0: the one regret I have from moving away from the Midwest was that when I lived in Detroit or Serling Heights, I was on the other end of effectively the same time zone.

21
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,357
Speaker 0: Well, not effectively.

22
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:38,164
Speaker 0: I was on the other end of this time zone So I basically got an extra hour of daylight every day that I don't get now.

23
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, try living in Boston or Somewhere like that.

24
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:42,560
Speaker 1: It's way East.

25
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

26
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:44,530
Speaker 0: I'd probably cry.

27
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:46,658
Speaker 0: I had enough trouble living in Rochester.

28
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:48,143
Speaker 0: It was cold all the time.

29
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:54,410
Speaker 1: Maybe someone should do like a little chart I bet like people who live on like Western halves of time zones a little a little happier.

30
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:54,779
Speaker 1: Maybe you

31
00:01:55,025 --> 00:02:04,642
Speaker 0: know they might be because that I don't understand why we don't just have daylight savings time all the time because all it does is give the Vast majority of people an extra hour of sunlight because

32
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:09,500
Speaker 1: crazy parents don't want their kids to Have it be dark in the morning, even though it's dark in the morning.

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,911
Speaker 0: Anyway, I know God even I remember getting up in high School.

34
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:15,220
Speaker 0: I'd get up at like 530 to go to high school.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,625
Speaker 0: Let me pitch black out.

36
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:17,268
Speaker 0: Yep.

37
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,390
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, walk up the hill and two miles in the snow barefoot.

38
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,226
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was your grandpa.

39
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:31,270
Speaker 1: So, yeah, anyway, it's I've been getting static shocks, you know from static electricity quite a bit lately.

40
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:35,230
Speaker 1: My some contributing factors might be you know, the wearing of sweaters.

41
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:46,036
Speaker 1: I mean, you know when I did my laundry this weekend I took me, you know the t-shirt out of the inside of the sweater because You know, but actually at work I've been having a real problem in the.

42
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:53,390
Speaker 1: you know, the bathroom has a door handle right and like for a good wait a minute Static electricity in the bathroom is always dangerous.

43
00:02:53,866 --> 00:03:04,025
Speaker 1: No No for like a week or so Right or even more than a week like every time I would go to the bathroom Right when I would reach for that handle to open up the door to the bathroom.

44
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:04,929
Speaker 1: I would get a shock.

45
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:08,324
Speaker 0: Wow, it's kind of like a reverse Pavlovian dog.

46
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:09,609
Speaker 0: We're now and think about it.

47
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:16,143
Speaker 0: Did you ever have this thought where you're walking up to that door and you're about to grab it and then you think oh I'm about to get shocked.

48
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:21,150
Speaker 1: I Was about to say that basically without even realizing it.

49
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:27,210
Speaker 1: I'm sort of every time now I go to that handle I hesitate and then just grab it anyway because I have to.

50
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,334
Speaker 0: Mr.

51
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,414
Speaker 0: Brown always hesitated when he touched Door handles.

52
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:35,210
Speaker 0: now I was in high school, but that was because we tended to put Tesla coils on the other sides of them.

53
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now I'm going to intend now what I'm gonna do to counteract this.

54
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:43,149
Speaker 0: You should carry around a little like de-static.

55
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,915
Speaker 1: er What do you?

56
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:45,398
Speaker 1: what?

57
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,062
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

58
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,210
Speaker 0: a wire?

59
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,371
Speaker 1: All right.

60
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,257
Speaker 1: What do I do with this wire?

61
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,771
Speaker 0: Well, I have one end of it just to hold two ends of it Right.

62
00:03:51,973 --> 00:04:05,119
Speaker 0: Yeah and touch one end to like the doorframe or like Dangle it on the ground or something or a light switch and when I guess get shot to that way Well an insulated wire God It's I would get shot you wouldn't it would.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,176
Speaker 0: it would go through the wire not shocking you It's not going to go into the wire.

64
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,124
Speaker 0: and then look it's like imagine this.

65
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,489
Speaker 0: Here's what the electricity is gonna do.

66
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,046
Speaker 0: Imagine you're in you're stuck in a traffic jam.

67
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:24,408
Speaker 0: You're an electron you're in this horrible traffic jam and and it really sucks and suddenly a 12-lane freeway appears directly in front of you.

68
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one else has access to it.

69
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:30,947
Speaker 0: But you yeah, so you charge down that thing as fast as you can.

70
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:39,009
Speaker 0: cuz goddamn and Along the way you see an exit an Exit that goes up and down a mountain and completely out of the way you want to go.

71
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:50,970
Speaker 0: but eventually we'll get where you're going and that's also full of traffic and it's one lane and there's a bus on fire or You can see at the end of the freeway where the hell's is going exactly where you want to go.

72
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,401
Speaker 0: The electricity is not gonna go through you.

73
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:57,550
Speaker 1: It's gonna go through the wire But it is how is the wire any different from the handle to the bathroom?

74
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:00,680
Speaker 0: Because you touch the other end of the wire to something.

75
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,090
Speaker 0: where do you think the electricity goes when you touch it?

76
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,319
Speaker 1: Where does it go when I touch the handle of the bathroom?

77
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:07,620
Speaker 1: Yes.

78
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,450
Speaker 0: Do you know where it goes out of me into the bathroom?

79
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:13,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah Well, it depends.

80
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,250
Speaker 1: It was if it goes out of me and shocks me through a wire out of me and shocks me through a hand.

81
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,775
Speaker 0: Well, if you take the wires you see and you have it dangling on the ground all the time Okay, that would do it.

82
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:25,918
Speaker 1: yes, cuz then it would.

83
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:36,722
Speaker 1: yes, but you know touching the wire to like something and prior to touching Anyway, you can always just carry a taser and get it back.

84
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:44,030
Speaker 1: Yeah Point is I gonna to unlearn this hesitation of touching the door handle?

85
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:48,089
Speaker 1: I'm just for now on I'm gonna just go for it like every time.

86
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:49,414
Speaker 0: Will you now?

87
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:59,894
Speaker 0: yes, I am if I worked at your office and I listen to this show There would so be a Tesla coil on the other side of that door handle tomorrow You might get the people who work in the other Offices on the floor.

88
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:06,425
Speaker 0: even the more people you get with a Tesla coil when you deploy it the better off you are as a human being All right.

89
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:08,568
Speaker 0: So what do you got in the news?

90
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:13,849
Speaker 1: It's actually got a bunch of news as I'm gonna combine here because they're more interesting when combined, right?

91
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:21,150
Speaker 1: So first of all, I got I got to put up some information, you know Cuz some people probably didn't listen to one of our early shows the window manager episode, right?

92
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,950
Speaker 1: So in Linux your your GUI is usually provided by the X window system, right?

93
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:32,750
Speaker 1: And the X window system just handles the windowing and stuff and it's actually on its own.

94
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,330
Speaker 1: It's just a server and you need to connect to it and run a window manager and you could choose from many window managers.

95
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,210
Speaker 1: There are many choices, but there are mostly only two really popular choices and then one sort of third choice, right?

96
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:46,585
Speaker 0: FVWM and ice.

97
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,209
Speaker 1: No, except CE is the third choice.

98
00:06:50,392 --> 00:07:04,628
Speaker 1: The two big choices the most popular choices are gnome and kte right and the main difference between the two is that gnome all of its gooey stuff is based on these GTK libraries and Katie all its gooey stuff is based on these QT libraries.

99
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:12,510
Speaker 0: now The difference as far as you can tell is that gnome has a lot of intelligent defaults and seems to just work and Katie Has a million check boxes.

100
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:18,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know tea some people like one some people like the other like, you know Linus Torvalds like Katie and I like gnome.

101
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,709
Speaker 1: so, you know do use whatever you like best.

102
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:27,610
Speaker 1: Ubuntu uses gnome kubuntu uses Katie e zoo boondoo with an ex uses XFCE whatever.

103
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:28,353
Speaker 0: I've actually been.

104
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:29,358
Speaker 1: there's a whole show on it.

105
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:31,608
Speaker 0: I've actually been using FVWM a lot at work.

106
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:36,530
Speaker 1: now I guess it's good, you know, if you have a really specialized, you know, it's ugly.

107
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,190
Speaker 0: It's ugly as hell because you can see easy to make FVWM do exactly what you want.

108
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,622
Speaker 0: It's just not easy to make it look good while it does it.

109
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:52,117
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, so The Katie recently has gone to Katie version 4 and if you want to try it out Kubuntu has a special live CD you can get now.

110
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:58,775
Speaker 1: in addition to that they Katie e. Oh, okay I forgot one more piece of backup information right.

111
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:04,188
Speaker 1: the QT library that you know Katie uses to do all its gooey stuff, right?

112
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:06,817
Speaker 1: He's made by this company called troll tech.

113
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:22,439
Speaker 1: now on Linux the QT library is sort of free open source But on Windows and Mac not as free and open source like they actually sell, you know QT libraries that you can make applications with them on Windows and Linux and whatnot.

114
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,687
Speaker 1: now The GTK libraries for gnome are fully open source.

115
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:29,396
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the Katie e4 came out recently.

116
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:29,997
Speaker 1: you can try it out.

117
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,207
Speaker 1: and What happened recently?

118
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,280
Speaker 1: is the troll tech company said?

119
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,039
Speaker 1: All right We're just gonna make it all sort of open source for Windows and for Mac also.

120
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:58,259
Speaker 1: So now you can make QT library applications work on all the OS's and the Katie People are actively porting k-office Amarok K-right, you know all the Katie e applications which are generally awesome to Windows and Mac.

121
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,318
Speaker 1: So I think that's pretty cool.

122
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,370
Speaker 1: Now it gets one step trickier.

123
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,380
Speaker 1: You can see all these things the Katie has been doing recently.

124
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:07,965
Speaker 1: Katie e4 came out.

125
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,413
Speaker 1: they updated, you know the QT's.

126
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,620
Speaker 1: they made them open source on the other OS's.

127
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,290
Speaker 1: They're porting the Katie applications to the other OS's.

128
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:24,798
Speaker 1: This is all leading up to something Unbeknownst to us, but now it was revealed Nokia is basically effectively going to buy troll tech right now.

129
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,418
Speaker 1: Nokia who makes phones, you know for nor right.

130
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:40,373
Speaker 1: so they're buying the company that makes the QT libraries that they use to do Katie e and all this other stuff and basically, they're going to become a. What do you call it a?

131
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,420
Speaker 1: Sponsor.

132
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,657
Speaker 1: You know when someone pays someone to make art for them you're a patron.

133
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:49,799
Speaker 0: Yes patron of the arts or in this case a patron of the.

134
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:53,393
Speaker 0: Well, I was trying to make a joke with arts, but doesn't really fit.

135
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:55,601
Speaker 1: So yep go on But they're.

136
00:09:55,862 --> 00:10:00,838
Speaker 1: Nokia is basically going to become a patron of Katie e and they're gonna own troll tech.

137
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:11,480
Speaker 1: So Nokia phones which run the Symbian OS I guess Traditionally are now going to be loaded with all sorts of Katie apps and you know things that are similar to Katie.

138
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:18,336
Speaker 1: So if you're someone who likes Katie Then a Nokia phone might be in your future and I think this is getting.

139
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,809
Speaker 1: this is getting pretty interesting here Especially for people who are you know Katie users.

140
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:30,159
Speaker 1: that could be some serious integration between like, you know Symbian phones and Katie on Linux and you know different Katie apps on all.

141
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:36,000
Speaker 1: you know You have these applications that work on all OSes because the QT will be on all OSes and your phone will you know?

142
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,064
Speaker 1: Integrate with those apps.

143
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:42,907
Speaker 1: So now people could choose their OS get a Nokia phone and work with the apps, you know It'd be good stuff's gonna happen.

144
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:49,159
Speaker 0: I think yeah, I'm so glad I have a new Blackberry now instead of blackberries not bad.

145
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,979
Speaker 0: Okay, the only problem I've done with having with the blackberry is that?

146
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:57,125
Speaker 0: Google apps are great Google domains are great.

147
00:10:57,486 --> 00:11:07,340
Speaker 1: Google domains and Google apps don't play together so well, but it's Google apps for domains But the Google mobile apps do not work with Google apps for domains and that is that is my trouble.

148
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:08,105
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm gonna.

149
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,420
Speaker 1: I'm gonna bitch about that at some point in the future.

150
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:11,638
Speaker 1: I got a whole thing to say.

151
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:19,180
Speaker 0: So I have two stories that are related in a way and I find it interesting that they both came out at a similar time.

152
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:20,063
Speaker 0: Now.

153
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:44,620
Speaker 0: first there is this idea that what if we had Cellphones all be radiation detectors or anthrax detectors or whatever just built in so they just kind of passively detect and now you basically have without having to do much other than put these in cell phones a Giant nationwide network of detectors that could be used to watch for terrorism or all sorts of dangerous things.

154
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:58,720
Speaker 1: Actually, you know in one in one sense it's not such a bad idea because it does allow for added security without any sort of invasion of privacy or reduction of civil liberties, but The problem I see is you know, if you have like people have Geiger counters in their pockets, right?

155
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,220
Speaker 1: You know normal people don't know shit about Geiger counters and radiation.

156
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:08,466
Speaker 1: So, you know, I mean if they have any way to see it detecting radiation, you know There's background radiation everywhere.

157
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:12,960
Speaker 1: Geiger counters tick all the time and it's gonna freak people out and they're gonna get crazy scared and stupid.

158
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:13,627
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

159
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:21,932
Speaker 0: This is being developed by Purdue And the idea is that and I can imagine that it wouldn't be Like just always on or accessible to the people who own the phone.

160
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:25,565
Speaker 0: unless you do something to activate it or look at the data You know the nerds are gonna.

161
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:34,812
Speaker 0: you know, they're gonna yeah, but the nerd who figures out how to unlock his cell phone Yeah knows how many milli rads are dangerous and how many aren't exactly.

162
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,220
Speaker 0: but I think it's interesting idea.

163
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:57,815
Speaker 0: But the thing I really want to talk about is that kind of pursuant to or related to this is this Article on slashdot about how there's a push in New York City to require permits to own any sort of biological or radiological Detecting device that is Geiger counters or anthrax detectors.

164
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:06,791
Speaker 1: Well, I could see banning You know nuclear weapons Rods of plutonium or anthrax but banning the things to detect them.

165
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:07,012
Speaker 1: what?

166
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,376
Speaker 1: what's the fucking point of that?

167
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:12,701
Speaker 1: as basically you're saying Hey everyone, bring your anthrax here no one will know.

168
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:34,720
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell the idea is that or the rationales that people are stupid like you said earlier and people are more and more as they get afraid of terrorism and all this sort of thing or realizing that they can buy just Geiger counters and all sorts of environmental detecting things and that People stupid in quantity with these things might detect radiation.

169
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,009
Speaker 0: that's perfectly natural and cause a panic.

170
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:44,720
Speaker 0: and in New York City where there's a lot of people living a Panic of stupid people is possibly the most dangerous thing that could ever happen in New York City.

171
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:48,690
Speaker 1: It's not a bad thinking but the correct solution to that to that problem.

172
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,274
Speaker 0: I have education.

173
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,096
Speaker 0: I have two solutions.

174
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:52,580
Speaker 0: education one.

175
00:13:53,363 --> 00:14:03,572
Speaker 0: You could just set up and I'm sure a lot of universities and things in New York City or even most of downstate New York Would love to do this free Geiger counter calibration places.

176
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:12,391
Speaker 0: you can just go and Calibrate your Geiger counter and a professional will make sure it's calibrated and give you a little pamphlet that explains how it works and then Deputize you as an honorary.

177
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:15,684
Speaker 0: watch out for the terrorist, dude I got another idea right.

178
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:25,780
Speaker 0: normal people aren't gonna be buying like the kind of Geiger counters you're gonna use in a real lab Right, actually most people seem to buy like surplus Soviet ones that they get from like sharper image kind of magazine.

179
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:26,824
Speaker 1: That's bad too.

180
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:34,540
Speaker 1: what someone should do is come up with a product that's sort of like the handy-dandy wuss Geiger counter Right where instead of going tick tick tick tick tick, you know.

181
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,563
Speaker 1: And then you'd like like.

182
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:41,079
Speaker 1: so like a normal Geiger counter does it'll just have green yellow and red and it would almost.

183
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:44,520
Speaker 1: it would basically Never turn red unless you've stuck it near some uranium or something.

184
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:45,766
Speaker 0: Even then it probably wouldn't.

185
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:47,515
Speaker 0: uranium is pretty inert.

186
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:55,840
Speaker 1: all things can say no But you know considering that almost nothing is gonna bring you to that level of radiation I mean maybe you know some weak uranium would make it yellow or something.

187
00:14:55,921 --> 00:15:03,956
Speaker 1: So that way you won't have idiots being scared But they'll still feel safe and they'll still spend money on your handy-dandy friendly user-friendly Geiger counter.

188
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:07,682
Speaker 1: I just I really Like.

189
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:13,460
Speaker 0: I see why they said they're pushing this law and I understand all the words that were written about it.

190
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,187
Speaker 0: not all that all the words that were said but they really just don't make sense to me because it's just all I Can't imagine.

191
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:29,080
Speaker 0: the government basically saying all right There may or may not be a fear out there this legitimate a thing that could be dangerous that could happen.

192
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:34,450
Speaker 0: So to protect you all we're going to ban the possession of anything that could detect that dangerous thing.

193
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:39,146
Speaker 0: Yeah Education can almost of course.

194
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,254
Speaker 0: then again we say oh just educate people.

195
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:49,040
Speaker 0: but at the same time How many people would even bother to go get educated or bother to even read the pamphlet that came with their Geiger counter or anything?

196
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,791
Speaker 1: The solution is to Socially engineer the people into not being dumbass isn't?

197
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,920
Speaker 1: because you can't educate them into not being dumb ass.

198
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,220
Speaker 0: So, how do you socially engineer people to not be stupid?

199
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,640
Speaker 1: They'll be afraid they buy your Geiger counter.

200
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,400
Speaker 1: But your Geiger counter is smarter than they are and it they will never scare them because it'll always be fucking green.

201
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:13,600
Speaker 0: but what if Joey Jojo Shabbat whose discount Geiger counters are five bucks on eBay and They go off after you give your cat some chemo.

202
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:19,186
Speaker 0: then What do we do about that?

203
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,195
Speaker 1: then the guy will show up and you'd be like it's cuz.

204
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,119
Speaker 1: he gave her cat chemo.

205
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,549
Speaker 1: As long as you see you explain why.

206
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,396
Speaker 1: if he doesn't know where it came from then I'll be afraid.

207
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:32,270
Speaker 0: I guess The summary I have is simply that this is a really stupid idea.

208
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,504
Speaker 1: Better yet right.

209
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:41,000
Speaker 1: to alleviate people's fear you give them a Geiger counter that doesn't tell them when there's danger.

210
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:46,399
Speaker 1: It just we assure them that if it detects danger it will radio, you know the authorities, okay,

211
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:56,860
Speaker 0: okay okay, now that makes sense because that's the kind of idea that's kind of the you know needs of the many over needs of the Few like the person who happens to be nearby if something goes off or something happens.

212
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:57,900
Speaker 1: I mean that'd be pretty good.

213
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,790
Speaker 1: Go Google Maps and get like a sort of.

214
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:06,300
Speaker 1: if there were these things all over the city You could see like radiation levels around the baby kind of like with the cell phone detectors.

215
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:12,338
Speaker 1: Yes, kinda only not in your cell phone against your will but intentionally purchasing on purpose.

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,390
Speaker 0: see I'm almost okay with the whole cell phone detectors even against your will kind of thing Just because the information you could gather not just nuclear danger.

217
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:37,659
Speaker 0: Oh my god anthrax, but you could detect a lot of Environmental information and you know the conditions of the air in places where people actually live and work constantly in my pocket The Condition of the air in my pocket the uranium in my pocket.

218
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:42,640
Speaker 0: Well, I know you carry a lot of like, you know, I got I got a big radioactive rod in my pants.

219
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,125
Speaker 0: But oh do you?

220
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:46,573
Speaker 0: oh, yes, I heard it was uh inert.

221
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:47,436
Speaker 1: Yeah.

222
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,707
Speaker 1: No quite the opposite I don't know.

223
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:51,360
Speaker 0: I find the phone out there.

224
00:17:51,561 --> 00:18:04,616
Speaker 0: I find my first news interesting and my second news not so much frightening or stupid, which is baffling things of the day.

225
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:16,834
Speaker 0: I like puppies, I like robots and Nothing is funnier than watching a puppy Interacting with an autonomous robot whose aggression level is set too high Really?

226
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,570
Speaker 1: I'm beginning to think YouTube is encouraging animal cruelty.

227
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:27,655
Speaker 1: I mean there's a look at all these people torturing their animals with lights and robots and and all sorts of manner of inanimate on at the same time.

228
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:34,030
Speaker 0: watch this video and The puppy's tail does not stop wagging at any point in this video.

229
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,121
Speaker 1: I think it's wagging in anger though and not in happy hugs.

230
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,546
Speaker 0: Oh, hey, they're tails in anger.

231
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:39,348
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

232
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,678
Speaker 1: Yes How do you know you read your dog brain reader?

233
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:44,765
Speaker 0: I know a lot about Deggs.

234
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:45,447
Speaker 1: Deggs.

235
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:49,845
Speaker 0: a lot of our caravans too Like Deggs, but like the thing is their videos like this.

236
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,010
Speaker 0: There's a lot of videos like this.

237
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,204
Speaker 0: There's a lot of videos involving puppies and this exact same robot.

238
00:18:54,686 --> 00:19:08,741
Speaker 0: of all those videos This one is the best because not only did they just have the video but they edited it properly Imposed man, they edited it to show all the cute funny bits and they added music sound effects and a scoreboard and they just.

239
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,089
Speaker 0: this is the perfect puppy versus robot video.

240
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:22,286
Speaker 0: and I think the best part at the end is where the puppies kind of figured out what's going on because at one point he looks Up at the dude who's obviously standing there with the camera with this look of seriously, dude.

241
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:23,250
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

242
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:26,101
Speaker 1: I think I can make a better puppy verse robot video.

243
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,010
Speaker 0: Well first you'd have to get yourself a puppy.

244
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,743
Speaker 1: No, I would just Photoshop some puppy into like a Gundam show or something.

245
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,930
Speaker 0: I would love to see you do that.

246
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,361
Speaker 0: I do not think that is in your realm of skill.

247
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:38,369
Speaker 1: No, I just pay someone else to do and say I did it.

248
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:41,854
Speaker 0: Scott patron of the arts.

249
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:42,817
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed.

250
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:46,670
Speaker 1: Alright, so so when you're in your blogging, right?

251
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,538
Speaker 0: Blogging we have blogs.

252
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,042
Speaker 0: Yeah.

253
00:19:49,243 --> 00:20:02,530
Speaker 1: Yeah when you're blogging Right you uh after you're done writing your blog post, you know, you write it you save it you edit it Eventually push that publish button and and then I almost immediately go ah shit and then I go edit.

254
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:15,850
Speaker 1: but I mean you know the the in theory right as far as you know the publish button what it does is it You know makes the post actually appear on your site instead of just in your administrators interface, right?

255
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:23,210
Speaker 1: But in fact when you click that publish button a whole shit ton of crazy things happen that you don't see going on.

256
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:31,030
Speaker 1: And unless you really understand how the web works You might not realize just how much happens when you push that publish button.

257
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,124
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on what kind of you know content management system using it does.

258
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:41,303
Speaker 1: it depends on a great many factors But it also depends on other people and how popular blog is.

259
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:43,410
Speaker 1: and you know exactly how much I mean.

260
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:56,997
Speaker 1: If you just start a new blog and push the publish button in your first post not much will happen if you're say Huge popular blog with a state-of-the-art content management system and you push the button a lot more stuff is gonna happen But you know really the many factors.

261
00:20:57,077 --> 00:21:00,670
Speaker 1: the point is my thing of the day is this little thing on wired here.

262
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,177
Speaker 1: That's a nice diagram.

263
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:09,524
Speaker 1: It's sort of interactive in a shitty way But the content is good enough to warrant the shitty interface of this diagram.

264
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:15,810
Speaker 1: and the diagram shows you If you're a layman and you don't really understand fully, you know the the details.

265
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:24,317
Speaker 1: but this will explain to you pretty simply all the crazy shit that goes on when you publish a blog post and If you're interested in blogs in the web and whatnot.

266
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:26,422
Speaker 1: This might be informative to you.

267
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,510
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and it's the 50th anniversary of Lego.

268
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,655
Speaker 0: We're not gonna say anything.

269
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:31,982
Speaker 0: be a show about Lego.

270
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,690
Speaker 1: I know we knew that it was coming up.

271
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,374
Speaker 1: We would have waited.

272
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:48,550
Speaker 0: Lego bricks are to bomb diggity And the only reason geek night still happens is because my mom still has all my Legos and the day she mails them to me Is the day geek night's ends as I build gigantic forts and then fight with Scott's gigantic farts

273
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,335
Speaker 1: But all my things are castle.

274
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:52,842
Speaker 0: I have a lot of castle.

275
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:56,553
Speaker 0: equally dispersed among the castle is a lot of ice planet Mm-hmm.

276
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:57,938
Speaker 0: I got any.

277
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:58,480
Speaker 0: we're not gonna talk.

278
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,025
Speaker 0: We just talked about that on like Thursday.

279
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,136
Speaker 0: No, so Software always gets better right?

280
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,123
Speaker 0: I mean every time software is updated.

281
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,247
Speaker 0: It always gets better.

282
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:11,111
Speaker 0: They always fix something They always make it faster stronger Lighter Bigger.

283
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:15,631
Speaker 1: I mean version 3 is always better than version 2 and version 4 is always better than version 3 Right.

284
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,518
Speaker 1: I mean they wouldn't make something worse.

285
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,566
Speaker 1: I mean you have something right?

286
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:20,510
Speaker 1: It's in a state.

287
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:22,159
Speaker 1: You do a bunch of work on it.

288
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,210
Speaker 1: Why would you do work on something?

289
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,745
Speaker 1: It takes you so much time and effort to have the result be worse than where you started.

290
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:28,970
Speaker 1: You're always moving forward.

291
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:39,716
Speaker 0: So You know a while ago I will a long time ago.

292
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:43,730
Speaker 0: I had a copy of a piece of software called cool edit.

293
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:59,856
Speaker 0: I had cool edit 2000 and that was eight years ago, and I had cool edit Pro Mmm, now cool edit was a suite of audio editing software single track but it also had a multitrack component that was written originally in like 1990 freaking one.

294
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:04,090
Speaker 0: All right, my some guy who is basically just an audio nerd.

295
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:07,009
Speaker 0: He was really into like audio and his cool guy.

296
00:23:08,774 --> 00:23:19,390
Speaker 0: I might have been two guys I forget but anyway, so the software Rapidly became the premier audio editing software in much of the civilized world.

297
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:22,210
Speaker 0: Most radio stations used it for almost everything they did this.

298
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:39,950
Speaker 0: This was just like the best audio editing software ever and it got better and better and better and better and better up until cool edit Pro version 2.1 and then in May of 2003 a company you may have heard of you might know him called Adobe

299
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,129
Speaker 1: adobe adobe

300
00:23:42,983 --> 00:23:46,655
Speaker 0: bots Centrillion which made cool edit.

301
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:47,176
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

302
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:55,135
Speaker 0: They then discontinued cool edit and Nominally included everything it did in a Audition.

303
00:23:55,758 --> 00:24:05,129
Speaker 1: yeah, they basically they made a new product called audition which is bait with a cool edit Pro and they adobe fight it and they called it audition and They made it worse.

304
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:06,754
Speaker 0: Yeah audition.

305
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:11,507
Speaker 0: Well when audition first came out, it was basically just cool edit and that was it.

306
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:19,050
Speaker 0: and then over time I mean I've used new versions of audition and I Contend that cool edit was like the best audio editing program ever.

307
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:31,230
Speaker 1: I mean audition does have some cool features like if you buy the right equipment, right like a digital mixing thing You can actually have say three microphones and it will record in audition in three separate tracks and that is pretty cool.

308
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,399
Speaker 0: But I can do that in cool edit.

309
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:34,423
Speaker 1: Yeah.

310
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:34,945
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:36,070
Speaker 1: How do you do in a cool edit?

312
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:38,300
Speaker 0: How do I do one cool that is specifically Scott?

313
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:39,989
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you could do a left and a right.

314
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:42,109
Speaker 0: You can record more than two tracks.

315
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:47,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you how can you separate it with a bunch of microphones in the same mixer split them up into separate tracks.

316
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:51,936
Speaker 1: with one Soundcard you can record from multiple sources But you only have one sound one USB hole.

317
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:52,378
Speaker 1: That's it.

318
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,149
Speaker 0: I only have one USB hole in my computer that has 12 USB holes.

319
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,077
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying is that?

320
00:24:58,157 --> 00:24:59,424
Speaker 1: well, that's what audition can do.

321
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:00,490
Speaker 1: is with what through?

322
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but it yeah, you can do more than two track recording.

323
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,730
Speaker 0: You can even do that with like audacity.

324
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,698
Speaker 1: Yes, but you need multiple input sources.

325
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,866
Speaker 1: audition can do it through one digital input.

326
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:10,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, so can Pro Tools.

327
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:12,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of things.

328
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:17,416
Speaker 1: Yes, but cool that it couldn't do that It's only one cool thing Audition does the cool that it doesn't do.

329
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:20,850
Speaker 1: and there are many cool things cool that it did that audition doesn't do.

330
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:31,582
Speaker 0: Well, the real deal was simply that I mean if you're doing like professional music like many many track music then Pro Tools and all Those professional programs and audition are actually pretty good.

331
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:32,244
Speaker 0: They're good for that.

332
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,650
Speaker 0: And that's what you probably should be using.

333
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:37,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the problem was what a lot of people use cool edit for.

334
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:40,859
Speaker 0: was radio Kind of like podcasting?

335
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,783
Speaker 0: now about some people talking You're probably gonna bring it down to like a stereo or a mono.

336
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:48,790
Speaker 0: am FM radio kind of thing?

337
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,219
Speaker 1: I can have too many tracks.

338
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:51,849
Speaker 0: You're gonna do a lot of single track editing.

339
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,346
Speaker 0: You're more concerned with like quickly editing and quickly processing.

340
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:57,389
Speaker 1: You're not really concerned.

341
00:25:57,751 --> 00:26:02,170
Speaker 1: You're mostly concerned with the volume and not so much, you know other things that you are concerned with music.

342
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:05,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you compress and all that stuff and you'll do a lot of filtering and stuff.

343
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,930
Speaker 0: But other than that, you don't need a lot.

344
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,989
Speaker 0: you just need a very specialized piece of software that does all those things very very efficiently and very very well.

345
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:20,062
Speaker 0: and Now this wouldn't have been a problem because an audition while the interface I don't think is the greatest thing in the world can do Most of what cool that it could do.

346
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:24,010
Speaker 0: Audition costs off fuck of a lot more than cool edited.

347
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:30,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean cool that it was originally like cripple wear where they you could get it But all a bunch of features were damaged and it costs.

348
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,313
Speaker 0: Did you say cripple?

349
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,908
Speaker 0: worry because you just looked it up on a Wikipedia and they say that it was cripple where they're.

350
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:40,305
Speaker 1: maybe Maybe But it was only a few hundred bucks and back in the day.

351
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:41,310
Speaker 1: We're like a few hundred bucks.

352
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,792
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

353
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,176
Speaker 1: We're not paying that now.

354
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:44,340
Speaker 1: What does audition cost?

355
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,745
Speaker 1: like a zillion dollars.

356
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:50,014
Speaker 0: now audition is like $400.

357
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:51,200
Speaker 1: it's like twice as much.

358
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,010
Speaker 0: and the thing is cool edit.

359
00:26:53,572 --> 00:27:03,021
Speaker 0: what I was used by radio stations and I'd always been under the impression and I'd had people tell me this before that a Lot of radio stations still use cool edit to this day.

360
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they had cool edit.

361
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:05,610
Speaker 1: cool edit was fine.

362
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,295
Speaker 1: It was perfect.

363
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:07,949
Speaker 1: It did everything they needed it to do.

364
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:13,628
Speaker 1: so why would anyone ever you know upgrade or switch to something else unless it was better?

365
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,571
Speaker 1: and What?

366
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:18,984
Speaker 1: the new product that came out was worse, so no one's changed or very few people have changed.

367
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,759
Speaker 0: Yeah now don't don't get me wrong It's not like a cool edit.

368
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,360
Speaker 0: was the second chroming of jeebus and audition Like can't edit audio at all or anything.

369
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,450
Speaker 0: auditions a pretty solid piece of software.

370
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:38,476
Speaker 0: The real issue is that cool edit was perfectly fine and had a lot of really good stuff in it and furthermore It served a very specific purpose.

371
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:42,530
Speaker 0: It filled a niche that there is no longer a solution that fills that niche.

372
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:49,045
Speaker 0: there is no longer a Low cost specialized piece of software for podcasting or radio.

373
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:50,249
Speaker 0: I mean, what are you gonna use?

374
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,222
Speaker 0: ReSound is the spiritual successor to cool edit.

375
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:59,907
Speaker 0: ReSound is great Except that it's really crappily written crashes all the time and isn't even half as functional.

376
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:07,570
Speaker 1: Yeah an audit and Audacity is free But audacity doesn't even do like 10% of the stuff cool that it does and the interface is not even close.

377
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:08,773
Speaker 0: Audacity olive.

378
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:15,718
Speaker 0: if any of you are using audacity to run like a compressor or anything, especially the built-in stuff Those things don't work.

379
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:16,702
Speaker 0: Those things are awful.

380
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,169
Speaker 0: That's why your podcast sounds bad.

381
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:22,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, and things like garage band are designed for music and the stuff that you know.

382
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:24,890
Speaker 1: Podcasting stuff is hacked in there and not good.

383
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,178
Speaker 1: That's why we couldn't stand it and I'm it's.

384
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:33,259
Speaker 0: it bothers me that there's really no kind of low-cost Entry-level single track.

385
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,330
Speaker 0: I want to do a podcast audio editing software that works.

386
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:43,110
Speaker 0: Yep, and I feel like someone could write something but no one does and I'm sure I don't have any time to do that.

387
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,376
Speaker 0: I've thought about it several times.

388
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:50,667
Speaker 0: I started learning lisp just so I could write Nyquist plugins, but Yeah, that's in the hopper with a lot of other things.

389
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:50,929
Speaker 0: Yeah.

390
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:59,181
Speaker 1: So another thing, right There was a program back in the day when you know mp3s are brand new.

391
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:02,390
Speaker 0: Oh, oh something that involves llamas and whoopings.

392
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:08,553
Speaker 1: Yeah The only way to really play mp3 is or at least the only practical way was use a pro called win amp win amp win have win amp.

393
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:12,106
Speaker 1: it really whips the llamas ass and I don't know why.

394
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:15,642
Speaker 1: there was a bad because Llama sheep with the sheep come from.

395
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:17,029
Speaker 0: what sound do you think llamas make?

396
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,057
Speaker 0: Nah No, and it was llamas.

397
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:23,408
Speaker 0: make the noise that you heard in cool it hurt not cool at it.

398
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:23,829
Speaker 0: and win amp.

399
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:31,116
Speaker 0: Anyway win amp by null soft was like the bomb people used to joke about how win And was more stable than windows.

400
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:34,047
Speaker 0: and like man if your window starts crashing just turn on win amp.

401
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:36,883
Speaker 0: It'll hold it together It'll take up all the RAM and didn't save it.

402
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:44,530
Speaker 1: Yeah When it was really was just a terrific program and pretty much everything null soft made was terrific programs.

403
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,735
Speaker 1: I wonder what happened to?

404
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,821
Speaker 1: because they went on.

405
00:29:46,861 --> 00:29:47,705
Speaker 1: remember they made that.

406
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:48,690
Speaker 1: what was the thing called?

407
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,539
Speaker 0: Well, they were bought by AOL.

408
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,230
Speaker 1: No, they were bought by AOL, right?

409
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:58,380
Speaker 1: But the guy just didn't frankly he went on and he made that other program That was like to make the encrypted peer-to-peer whatever.

410
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:58,882
Speaker 1: remember that.

411
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:03,928
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and whatever happened with that I did that obviously didn't pan out but that I don't know what he went on to do.

412
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:05,075
Speaker 1: after that I got to look him up.

413
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:06,384
Speaker 0: cuz you continue to tell the story.

414
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:07,250
Speaker 0: I'll look up that business.

415
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, every program he ever made was awesome.

416
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,970
Speaker 1: The guy the Justin Frankel I think of null soft, right?

417
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:21,462
Speaker 1: Anyway, so when amp came out when it was like the perfect mp3 playing program in every way and it pretty much set the standard For mp3 plug playing programs from there on out, right?

418
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:27,123
Speaker 1: It was like the best thing ever Yeah, and it just kept getting better and better and better and better and better and better.

419
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:33,283
Speaker 1: right then one day They you know, they got win f1 they went up to and they just kept improving.

420
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:39,690
Speaker 1: when amp 2 without making any big changes You know, they would just fix bugs and add features and fix bugs and add features to win amp 2, right?

421
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:40,673
Speaker 0: Nutella.

422
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,819
Speaker 0: but the one you were thinking of I think was waste.

423
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,410
Speaker 1: Yeah waste that was the one waste was some actually hot shit.

424
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:46,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, win it.

425
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:47,777
Speaker 1: Yeah Think about that.

426
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:55,430
Speaker 1: Nutella the most popular Peer-to-peer thing there is was the same was also written by the guy who wrote win amp is an important software developing guy.

427
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:55,798
Speaker 1: All right.

428
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,056
Speaker 0: Yep way Oh, we should do an episode on waste.

429
00:30:58,217 --> 00:30:59,461
Speaker 0: just the concepts of waste.

430
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:07,390
Speaker 0: cuz if you wanted to do shady business on the internet If you wanted to pull off illegal shenanigans waste was basically written to facilitate that.

431
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,945
Speaker 1: We tried to set it up in college and we did but we could.

432
00:31:10,246 --> 00:31:10,870
Speaker 1: it was so diff.

433
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,622
Speaker 1: It was too difficult with the key sharing.

434
00:31:12,682 --> 00:31:13,890
Speaker 1: No one actually got to you.

435
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,217
Speaker 0: It was basically one of those.

436
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:20,244
Speaker 0: it was so secure that none of us It was not worth the effort to be that secure in our lives.

437
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:21,330
Speaker 0: I didn't have much to hide.

438
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,319
Speaker 1: So no plus, you know waste wasn't all that complicated.

439
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:24,459
Speaker 1: like.

440
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,305
Speaker 1: I could write waste if I wanted to.

441
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:27,950
Speaker 1: so, you know, whatever anyway.

442
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:43,081
Speaker 1: So when it was great and eventually I said, all right when amp 2 is great We're gonna come out with when amp 3 and when amp 3. the big advantage of it was that you could do these crazy skins Because you know when it one of the big when I'm as big as thing was the skins, you know It was skinnable before any other.

443
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:44,410
Speaker 1: anything else is skinnable, right?

444
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:49,126
Speaker 0: So I used to have a collection of like 200 anime themed skins.

445
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:51,904
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It was all about the way to win am skin.

446
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:52,609
Speaker 0: I'll win it.

447
00:31:53,252 --> 00:31:56,823
Speaker 1: I remember picking the win am skin was so important to match your desktop wallpaper.

448
00:31:56,924 --> 00:32:01,459
Speaker 0: I had a plug-in that would Rotate the skins depending on like.

449
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:02,101
Speaker 0: it was awesome.

450
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:02,683
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

451
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,027
Speaker 0: Those were good days.

452
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:04,810
Speaker 1: It was a good days.

453
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have nostalgia for those days.

454
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,263
Speaker 1: I wish computing was so simple now.

455
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:10,551
Speaker 0: I remember specifically I think was version 1.91 or 1.9.

456
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:16,503
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, oh Those are good days.

457
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:23,170
Speaker 1: Okay So when I'm three came out and the thing with when I'm three you think when I'm three be better than when I'm two now?

458
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:24,257
Speaker 1: It was just shit.

459
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,284
Speaker 1: It was slow.

460
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:26,190
Speaker 1: It was unstable.

461
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:30,690
Speaker 1: It crashed used too many resources and offered no advantages over win empty whatsoever.

462
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:36,510
Speaker 1: Besides that you could go crazy with the skins and going crazy with the skins made it slower and shittier and it sucked.

463
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:37,774
Speaker 0: It was less stable.

464
00:32:37,794 --> 00:32:50,328
Speaker 1: and wasn't that right after AOL bottom and they included a lot of it was either right after right before And it was not good times not good times at all And people just kept using win amp 2 and didn't use win amp 3 and eventually they sorta win.

465
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:54,509
Speaker 1: M3 was sort of like was like beta and then they sort of pulled it back.

466
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:59,210
Speaker 1: Eventually like over time they tried they tried to push it forward and then they pulled it back.

467
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,537
Speaker 1: They cuz it sucks so much that no one used it.

468
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:05,609
Speaker 1: Everyone used win amp 2 anyway, and he was like, haha we win we win.

469
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:13,289
Speaker 0: And eventually now they think they're winning five or six or that what they basically they realize that Everyone had turned on them.

470
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:23,753
Speaker 0: So what they did is they came out with win at five and the rationale was we took the good stuff from two You know the fact that it worked and the good stuff from three Not much.

471
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:30,413
Speaker 0: and they made five which was actually really really good and that was pretty much the mp3 player Until very recently.

472
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:35,527
Speaker 1: Well 5.52 is the current version according to win amp calm and it is the mp3.

473
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:36,570
Speaker 1: It's it's pretty badass.

474
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:42,917
Speaker 1: I mean if I if you're not using iTunes and an iPod when amp is the way to go It's still to this day, but we know unless

475
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,689
Speaker 0: you're in Linux then I use audacious and xmm s depending on what I'm

476
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:54,630
Speaker 1: doing Amarok or whatever, but the audacious also, but yet when a version 3 was worse than 2 quite significantly

477
00:33:56,074 --> 00:34:05,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't need to get into all the details But it had like serious problems and also I think a lot of people just didn't trust it because they didn't trust what was going On with the development.

478
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:06,119
Speaker 0: and there there was.

479
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:07,424
Speaker 0: there was shading is going on.

480
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:11,524
Speaker 1: There was indeed shading is going on But why does software get worse?

481
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:12,370
Speaker 0: How can this happen?

482
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:23,476
Speaker 1: well Sometimes it just happens where you know, so software, you know gets worse for the same reasons that Software is bad in the first place.

483
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:27,610
Speaker 1: right like you see a new project and the project will result in a bad piece of software.

484
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:37,570
Speaker 1: Well when someone you know tries to make a big change to a piece of software It's really no different than when you try to make a brand new piece of software and what they try could suck.

485
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:41,766
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, what if they tried to make an mp3 player from scratch?

486
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:42,489
Speaker 1: Well, it might suck.

487
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:48,510
Speaker 1: Well, when m3 was just a new mp3 player from scratch just they just called it when m3 and it sucked.

488
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:58,441
Speaker 1: if you poorly designed software if you aim too high if you if you have Ideas, but those ideas aren't actually good ideas.

489
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,630
Speaker 1: They're good on paper, but in reality, they're no good.

490
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:03,639
Speaker 1: You know all those things can cause a piece of software to get worse.

491
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:08,094
Speaker 0: I think also there's a there's a factor that and this happens A lot with operating systems.

492
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:13,714
Speaker 0: I mean how many times is Microsoft release an update and it fixes something But it breaks something else?

493
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:26,450
Speaker 0: or there's a kernel update in Linux and now there's support for the food bass motherboard Whatever but suddenly support for the bar bass bad bad motherboard doesn't work so well and you start getting kernel panics.

494
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, this this can happen a lot.

495
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,950
Speaker 1: I mean if you're especially with low-level software like, you know kernels and thing and drivers and whatnot is you know?

496
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,937
Speaker 1: You're you're writing this piece of software.

497
00:35:35,997 --> 00:35:39,750
Speaker 1: Let's say it's a sound card driver, right and that sound card driver supports.

498
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:43,010
Speaker 1: You know, there are five different sound cards that will all use that same driver.

499
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:48,050
Speaker 1: Well, let's say a new sound card comes out and that sound card also wants to use that driver.

500
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,002
Speaker 1: Okay so you modify the sound card driver to work with that new sixth sound card.

501
00:35:53,704 --> 00:36:01,290
Speaker 1: in doing that you might make it so that some of the old sound cards don't work anymore and you really have to test it with all the different sound cards to make sure.

502
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,841
Speaker 1: And you know if you you know that you're you have win m2.

503
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:07,790
Speaker 1: it works on all these different Windows computers.

504
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:10,662
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you make some changes to it.

505
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:20,410
Speaker 1: suddenly, you know, you might you know It might work on your computer and all the computers you have available But you might have done something that makes it not work for people who have a certain video card.

506
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,891
Speaker 1: You don't know.

507
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:34,810
Speaker 1: it could happen and you know, so whenever you're changing a piece of software and for any reason There's always a chance that you could make it work or not work depending on you know, the peculiarities of any individual users.

508
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,290
Speaker 1: You know configuration hardware and software.

509
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:47,230
Speaker 0: Now, I guess a lot of people might have expected us to say the the obvious of well The reason software gets bad and can't get fixed is because obviously it's closed source.

510
00:36:47,230 --> 00:37:16,368
Speaker 0: I mean look if cool edit had been open source, then people would have just forked the good version and Continued with it forever and resin would have basically just been cool at it awesome, or when when m3 came out people would have just kept making when I'm too better, but Open source software suffers from this problem just as much because While open source means yes, if things go bad You don't like the direction development is going you can always just cut and run take the good version and then fix it.

511
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:20,541
Speaker 0: But how many people at the time or the expertise or the knowledge?

512
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:23,770
Speaker 0: not just programming but in terms of what the software does?

513
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:34,870
Speaker 0: I mean if you want to write a cool edit or you want to write a resound You don't just have to know how to code You have to know about audio a lot about audio or you have to know someone who does and it's not.

514
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:41,330
Speaker 0: It's often a fallacy that just because something's open source means you're always safe from problems in the development chain.

515
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:45,243
Speaker 1: Well, you're safe in the fact that if the new version is worse.

516
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:47,270
Speaker 1: The old version is always still available.

517
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:54,023
Speaker 1: I mean, you know what if we're nap, you know, you they don't have the old versions available on their website They only have the new version there.

518
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:58,403
Speaker 0: as far as I know They actually did for a long time keep available version 2 and version 3.

519
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, they might still I don't know.

520
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,477
Speaker 0: But plus don't forget old versions calm.

521
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:02,998
Speaker 1: There was.

522
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,122
Speaker 1: is that website still around?

523
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:04,985
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

524
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:06,028
Speaker 1: I'm gonna check right now.

525
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,395
Speaker 0: But I mean, yeah, that is true.

526
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:21,323
Speaker 0: I mean at the same time, I guess we're just lucky in that cool edit specifically Centrillion doesn't exist anymore at all and Copy protection was not quite as robust as it is now.

527
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:23,610
Speaker 0: back then there was no like phoning home or anything.

528
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:27,421
Speaker 0: If you want a copy of cool edit, you can probably get it.

529
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:38,072
Speaker 0: However, I will say that every version of cool edit I've ever seen on the the torrent networks out there every single one without exception has been absolutely full of Malware.

530
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:42,170
Speaker 0: like you wouldn't believe you do not want to install cool edit that you just find somewhere on the internet.

531
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,575
Speaker 0: Get it from someone you trust.

532
00:38:44,177 --> 00:38:46,044
Speaker 0: try to make a friend at a radio station.

533
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:46,767
Speaker 0: They'll give it to you.

534
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:50,910
Speaker 1: Hey By the way, I'm at old version calm here.

535
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:54,301
Speaker 1: An old version calm doesn't need seeds still exist anymore.

536
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:55,144
Speaker 0: It's a porn site now.

537
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:56,227
Speaker 1: No, it's.

538
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,070
Speaker 1: he's got all these.

539
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,096
Speaker 1: He's got old versions.

540
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,610
Speaker 1: You can get old versions of all these different programs.

541
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,178
Speaker 1: In fact, you can get old versions of cool edit bro.

542
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:08,094
Speaker 1: You can get cool edit one three two one three three really for a 2.0.

543
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:12,909
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're unlocked or anything, but he's got old versions here, huh?

544
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,639
Speaker 0: I would look into this cuz I forgot.

545
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:17,570
Speaker 0: I didn't really think I'd to be honest.

546
00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:20,990
Speaker 0: I did not believe that that website was still around and I did not do my due diligence.

547
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,001
Speaker 1: They got cool edit Pro 2.0 cool edit Pro 2000.

548
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,064
Speaker 0: Do they have 2.1?

549
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:26,570
Speaker 0: Cuz that's that's the that's the business.

550
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,335
Speaker 1: No, they don't have 2.1.

551
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:31,746
Speaker 1: Ah, oh, well, but they got you know, let's see.

552
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:33,150
Speaker 1: They got let's see iTunes.

553
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,291
Speaker 1: They have every version of iTunes from 4.1 to 7.0 to It.

554
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:45,090
Speaker 0: didn't old version calm because newer is not always better is I think the best example of that ever was Windows me.

555
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:49,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was newer Arguably, it was not better.

556
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:50,970
Speaker 1: Well, Vista's the same way.

557
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,880
Speaker 1: It's it's newer, but it's arguably not better.

558
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,890
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't like it and it's really not granted too.

559
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,276
Speaker 0: Well, I will say this.

560
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:06,125
Speaker 0: I think that a lot of the people who say they don't like Vista Don't know why they don't like Vista and don't actually understand what is good or bad about Vista.

561
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:11,262
Speaker 0: I think I've heard a lot of Unreasonable unverified claims that Vista has bad things in it.

562
00:40:11,282 --> 00:40:13,050
Speaker 0: That's just totally and patently not true.

563
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Vista's only real problem is that it's not significantly better.

564
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,010
Speaker 1: It's just more of the same.

565
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:19,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not it's not really.

566
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,463
Speaker 1: I used it.

567
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:21,910
Speaker 1: It wasn't terrible or anything.

568
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,435
Speaker 1: I don't know and see what people are crying about.

569
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:29,555
Speaker 0: I use Windows 95 like B right or a right up until Windows 2000 came out.

570
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's just because I didn't have USB.

571
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:32,884
Speaker 0: So I had no reason to upgrade.

572
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:37,561
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Oh ICQ there's another program you hated when it changed.

573
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:42,189
Speaker 0: Oh, man, I see Q. They made new versions of ICQ.

574
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:43,550
Speaker 0: Let me tell you a lot.

575
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,785
Speaker 0: The only complaint people had against ICQ was that it was kind of bloated and it was.

576
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:50,539
Speaker 0: but part of the reason I think you like it was like the first one.

577
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:57,140
Speaker 0: it was like god damn people don't realize how old ICQ was but made by that there's Israeli company Mirabilis.

578
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:57,581
Speaker 1: Yep.

579
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:06,328
Speaker 0: It was hot shit and there was Spira Mirabilis Spira Mirabilis soup But like oh did we did a show on the history of I am didn't we?

580
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:07,931
Speaker 1: Think we did?

581
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:08,913
Speaker 0: if we didn't we will.

582
00:41:09,494 --> 00:41:12,077
Speaker 0: but yeah ICQ was like it wasn't.

583
00:41:12,117 --> 00:41:12,938
Speaker 0: I mean I am.

584
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:13,900
Speaker 0: was this new concept?

585
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,694
Speaker 0: so AOL had its.

586
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:19,206
Speaker 0: I am but it was basically just check and nothing else.

587
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,250
Speaker 0: It was like chat with someone.

588
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:22,594
Speaker 1: It was it was chat room with two people.

589
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:40,512
Speaker 0: It wasn't I am and ICQ was kind of like directly in between email and instant messaging like it was a full-on messaging solution as in it had the Statefulness and the offline delivery and the multi-chatness of email coupled with the immediacy of AOL.

590
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:44,337
Speaker 0: you know instant messenger kind of thing and I think that it was the best fusion.

591
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,289
Speaker 0: the problem was it was written by a bunch of cool dudes.

592
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:46,430
Speaker 0: who?

593
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:53,030
Speaker 0: Were all cool and techie and as a result the interface looked like something that only a hardcore techie could love.

594
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,830
Speaker 1: It had way too many buttons and they kept adding way too many features.

595
00:41:57,111 --> 00:42:00,903
Speaker 0: But and then they started adding bullshit to it and then AOL just bought it.

596
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:02,830
Speaker 1: and then yeah, that was the end of that.

597
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, ICQ died the day AOL bought it.

598
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:06,009
Speaker 1: pretty much.

599
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:12,850
Speaker 0: You know though I think you died long time before that and I think the it was taken off life support when AOL bought it.

600
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:15,295
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, of course now.

601
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:16,843
Speaker 0: I have Google talk and I couldn't care less.

602
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:22,440
Speaker 1: Nope could not care jabbers, but anyway Yeah, we got anything else to say on this topic.

603
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,244
Speaker 0: I don't think we do.

604
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:23,767
