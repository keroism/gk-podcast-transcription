1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,709
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday November 8, and this is Geeklands.

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:20,489
Speaker 0: It's video game night, and we'll be talking about the upcoming releases for the Nintendo DS and some old-school NES and SNES games we recently revisited.

3
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,220
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

4
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:25,495
Speaker 1: So it's election day.

5
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:26,641
Speaker 0: I voted.

6
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:27,545
Speaker 0: I voted.

7
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:28,570
Speaker 0: Who'd you vote for?

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,290
Speaker 1: I didn't vote for any people because I didn't like any of the people on the ballot.

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:42,590
Speaker 0: I didn't know or like any of the people on the ballot, but there were three people in the right-to-life party with this cute little, you know, baby in a womb, so I voted for their competitors.

10
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:47,230
Speaker 1: Haha, and I voted for, there's the bill on putting money into trains.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,270
Speaker 0: I voted for trains because I ride one every day.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,270
Speaker 1: And there's that bill on the budget that you didn't understand.

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,510
Speaker 0: I don't understand it at all.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,549
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of good.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,743
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I'm sure it'll get.

16
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:56,448
Speaker 0: yes because...

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,675
Speaker 1: So it was scary though.

18
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:00,710
Speaker 1: I walked into the VFW, the big building in Beacon, to vote.

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

20
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:04,569
Speaker 1: And I walk into the lobby, and there's no one there, no signs, nothing.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:05,942
Speaker 0: You had to go in the side.

22
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:06,610
Speaker 0: You went in the front door?

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,280
Speaker 1: I went in the front door.

24
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:07,830
Speaker 1: I'm standing there.

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,749
Speaker 0: You're supposed to go in the side door.

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,210
Speaker 1: There's no sign on the outside or anything.

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,050
Speaker 0: There was a sign in the outside and the side door.

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,775
Speaker 0: Well, there isn't now.

29
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:14,729
Speaker 1: There's no one there anyway, but I'll get to that.

30
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,097
Speaker 1: So I'm standing in the lobby.

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,830
Speaker 1: There's no one there, no signs, nothing.

32
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:19,436
Speaker 1: So I'm looking around.

33
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:21,950
Speaker 1: I try some doors, and they're all locked, and I see a stairs.

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,019
Speaker 1: I go down the stairs.

35
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:23,969
Speaker 1: There's a light on.

36
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:24,358
Speaker 1: Yep.

37
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,829
Speaker 1: There's a big, like, room.

38
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:26,690
Speaker 1: It's a bingo hall.

39
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,890
Speaker 1: And in that room, there are a few people, like two people at each desk, and there's like one person voting.

40
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:37,807
Speaker 1: And apparently, in our ward, our district, 300 people voted.

41
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:38,590
Speaker 1: Total.

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,490
Speaker 1: Awesome.

43
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,217
Speaker 1: I was like the 301st person.

44
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,050
Speaker 0: Awesome.

45
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,310
Speaker 1: There are, like, thousands of people in our ward.

46
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:46,630
Speaker 0: Really?

47
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least a thousand people.

48
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,110
Speaker 0: Well, that's about right.

49
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, about a third, a little under a third.

50
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,550
Speaker 0: You know, in a presidential election, you usually get about half.

51
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:56,102
Speaker 0: Yeah.

52
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,890
Speaker 0: So in a local do-nothing election, a third is pretty good.

53
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,970
Speaker 1: Where there's nothing up at all.

54
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,090
Speaker 0: Although the train thing is kind of important.

55
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:04,590
Speaker 1: I'm not too worried about its passing.

56
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,370
Speaker 0: The only thing on the ballot was there was this independence party, which I went to their website, which is really crappy.

57
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:14,389
Speaker 0: And they said they're the third biggest party in New York State.

58
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,670
Speaker 0: And based only on what they say on their site, I think I like them better than the other ones.

59
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,929
Speaker 0: But who can trust that?

60
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the Republicans say that they're the party of balanced budgets.

61
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,350
Speaker 0: And small governments.

62
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Democrats say they're the party—well, it doesn't matter.

63
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:28,250
Speaker 1: They all lie.

64
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:28,983
Speaker 0: They all lie.

65
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:33,869
Speaker 0: But if I find more out about this party and they're actually good, I might go for them.

66
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,550
Speaker 0: Because they don't have the wackiness of libertarians, but they have some of the good parts of them.

67
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Speaker 0: And they seem to actually, you know, third biggest party in New York State.

68
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,629
Speaker 0: Not too bad.

69
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:43,849
Speaker 1: Not too bad.

70
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,269
Speaker 0: Because I don't think they're lying about that part.

71
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,770
Speaker 1: At least the ballot definitely— Well, they're on the ballot, so that's one small step.

72
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:53,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, not too bad.

73
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:59,010
Speaker 0: So, you know, remember that time the newspaper called me trying to sell a subscription?

74
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then we told them that we had the internet and we really didn't need dead tree paper?

75
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,569
Speaker 0: Apparently that's actually a lot more common than we think.

76
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:21,590
Speaker 0: Because, you know, newspapers now realize that no one under the age of, I don't know, 53, 90, 100, reads the freaking newspaper and, you know, in 20 years they're probably going to be out of business.

77
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, the last time I read a paper is because I got a free one from somewhere.

78
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,489
Speaker 0: Right, so the newspapers aren't dumb, apparently, and they know this.

79
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,010
Speaker 0: So their latest plan to get kids to get hooked on the newspaper?

80
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,210
Speaker 0: They're going to throw some manga in the comic section.

81
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Boston Globe had a thing about it, but the Boston Globe doesn't seem to know what manga is.

82
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:44,110
Speaker 1: And they wrote probably the most uninformative article I've ever read in my life.

83
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,030
Speaker 0: Well, is it from the AP, or is it something that they wrote?

84
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:48,980
Speaker 1: Uh, it's hard to tell.

85
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,430
Speaker 1: They don't mention the AP wire.

86
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,910
Speaker 0: Alright, because the AP carried the story, and the Anime News Network, who knows what's up, picked it up.

87
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,205
Speaker 1: Alright, because I was curious what they meant by manga.

88
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:58,930
Speaker 1: Is that actual manga?

89
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,855
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's the story.

90
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:10,590
Speaker 0: They took two Tokyo Pop mangas, and what they syndicated them, and the person syndicating them, or the company, is UPS, UPI, whatever you want to call them.

91
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,327
Speaker 0: They're the ones who put all Garfield and Doonesbury in the newspaper.

92
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:20,649
Speaker 0: And any newspaper that subscribes to that syndicate can subscribe to these manga.

93
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,450
Speaker 0: And the thing about this is like, alright, that's not so bad.

94
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:38,350
Speaker 0: You know, maybe it'll get real popular, and they'll sell a bunch of papers because of it, and then they'll fill a whole section of the newspaper with like two pages of manga, or they'll put like a manga insert in there.

95
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:53,706
Speaker 1: Now do they realize just how much manga, because I imagine that the manga they chose was based on some sort of industry research, but most popular manga are very girly and tend to involve things like BL, Boys Kissing Boys.

96
00:04:55,771 --> 00:05:01,450
Speaker 0: It's funny you should mention this, because in fact I know the only two mangas that have been syndicated.

97
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,009
Speaker 1: And these two manga are?

98
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,430
Speaker 0: The first, they're both from Tokyo Pop, and the first one is Van Von Hunter.

99
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,549
Speaker 1: Van Von Hunter.

100
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,710
Speaker 0: And the second one is Peach Fuzz.

101
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,510
Speaker 1: That just reeks of masculinity.

102
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,750
Speaker 0: In other words, they picked two completely crap, crap, crap manga.

103
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,650
Speaker 1: I don't know, I actually haven't heard of either one, so they might be good, we just don't know about them.

104
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,729
Speaker 0: They're Tokyo Pop manga that we've never heard of.

105
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:30,883
Speaker 0: There's a 99.9% chance.

106
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:31,790
Speaker 0: they're complete crap.

107
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll give them a chance.

108
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:51,130
Speaker 0: I'll give it a chance, I'll go look at, now that I've seen the names of these, next time I go to the bookstore, I'll look at the first volume of each one to see what it's like, but I saw the pictures of the covers, and if you go to tokyopop.com, it looks like all those crap mangas that they print.

109
00:05:51,390 --> 00:06:00,028
Speaker 0: It's really, I think the strategy here was Tokyo Pop was like, "Hey, we won't lose graphic novel sales if we give them something crap that isn't selling

110
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:00,369
Speaker 0: anyway.".

111
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,846
Speaker 1: And the newspapers probably said, "Hey, we want something that doesn't have boys kissing, or girls kissing, or sex, or violence, or

112
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:05,149
Speaker 1: anything.".

113
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:14,367
Speaker 0: And, and the third thing is that, "Hey, maybe we'll be able to sell this manga that isn't selling if people in the newspaper get hooked on it and then realize they can buy a whole bunch of it at

114
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:14,689
Speaker 0: once.".

115
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,230
Speaker 1: Makes sense.

116
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,689
Speaker 1: See, my issue isn't any of that.

117
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,745
Speaker 1: The only issue I really have is just that, in my eyes, this is very much an instance of, "Too little, too

118
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:24,008
Speaker 1: late.".

119
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,884
Speaker 0: Definitely, "Too little, too

120
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:26,167
Speaker 0: late.".

121
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:41,290
Speaker 0: But I think that what's gonna happen, if it doesn't happen soon, it'll happen in, I don't know, I guess a year or two from now, at the most, is that someone's gonna print a real giant Shonen Jump-type thing on cheap, cheap paper in this country.

122
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,988
Speaker 0: Someone has to do it.

123
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,669
Speaker 1: But no one's done it yet!

124
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,710
Speaker 0: They've done it regular Shonen Jump.

125
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,798
Speaker 0: The problem is it still has that U.S.

126
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,227
Speaker 0: stigma of "slightly better than crap

127
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:51,568
Speaker 0: paper."

128
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,570
Speaker 0: Not, you know, it's only half the size of the real Shonen Jump.

129
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,030
Speaker 0: It only comes out monthly.

130
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,768
Speaker 1: Yeah.

131
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:07,310
Speaker 0: People were talking, like, Marvel Comics should take, like, you know, two pages from every comic book they make every week and stick them all in a thing.

132
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,610
Speaker 0: And everyone would buy that thing because it would be, like, you know, the price of one comic book.

133
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:19,309
Speaker 0: And then they would read two pages of every Marvel comic book and get hooked on, like, different ones from the two pages and such.

134
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,650
Speaker 0: You know, they're just talking around, you know, ideas and stuff.

135
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:29,550
Speaker 0: But I really think someone's gonna do something like that and they're gonna rake it in, especially if they can get it into the supermarket.

136
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:34,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, like, the Boston Globe keeps saying things like, "Oh, manga isn't

137
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,165
Speaker 1: mainstream."

138
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,606
Speaker 1: And, "Oh, this is just, we're doing it to get

139
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:37,989
Speaker 1: readers.".

140
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,350
Speaker 1: But I think it's gonna get mainstream and we're gonna see things like that.

141
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:50,710
Speaker 0: It's not mainstream because it's not something that everyone knows about, but it's definitely mad popular and it's invading, you know, the bookstores.

142
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:52,250
Speaker 0: It's, like, right under mainstream.

143
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,129
Speaker 1: A lot of the bookstores seem kind of miffed at this.

144
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,266
Speaker 1: Like, they don't understand it.

145
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,749
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh, there's a bookstore near us, the one we went

146
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:57,850
Speaker 1: to.".

147
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,330
Speaker 1: They have a manga section with, like, old crap, like, old volumes of stuff that no one reads anymore.

148
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:04,769
Speaker 1: And they don't update it.

149
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,029
Speaker 1: They don't get the newer ones in.

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,830
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, is that they understand what manga is because they read their bookstore trade magazines and such.

151
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,030
Speaker 0: But they don't know-- But they don't know, you know, they're not experts.

152
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,669
Speaker 0: They don't know which one's good, which one's bad.

153
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,950
Speaker 1: They should all hire one, like, 13-year-old girl to tell them what to buy.

154
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,810
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to hire a 13-year-old girl.

155
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,009
Speaker 0: But, I mean, let's say we ran a bookstore, right?

156
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,230
Speaker 0: The manga section would be great.

157
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,370
Speaker 0: The sci-fi section might be great, right?

158
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,085
Speaker 0: But we wouldn't know what to do in, like, the new age section with all the fake crap in it.

159
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,190
Speaker 0: I mean, we might just not have the section.

160
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,450
Speaker 0: But what about, like, the cooking section?

161
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,870
Speaker 0: We wouldn't know which cookbooks are better than others.

162
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,227
Speaker 1: You know what?

163
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:40,748
Speaker 1: You know what?

164
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,289
Speaker 1: We'd ask someone.

165
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you see, that's the thing is, you know, they have these giant bookstores.

166
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,970
Speaker 0: They're not as personal as, like, the tiny, tiny bookstore.

167
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,429
Speaker 0: Or the comic book shop.

168
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,389
Speaker 0: The comic book shop is, like, the most personal place you can get, you know?

169
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,280
Speaker 0: You go to the checkout aisle at Borders, and they're just like, "Thank you, have a nice

170
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:57,524
Speaker 0: day.".

171
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,640
Speaker 0: You go to the checkout aisle at the comic shop, it's like, "Hey, what you reading

172
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:01,066
Speaker 0: there?".

173
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:02,943
Speaker 0: "Oh, what's that?

174
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:03,608
Speaker 0: I didn't know about

175
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:03,750
Speaker 0: that.".

176
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:04,841
Speaker 0: "Oh, it's

177
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:05,188
Speaker 0: great.".

178
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:06,967
Speaker 0: Or, "What's wrong with you reading

179
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:07,170
Speaker 0: that?".

180
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,588
Speaker 0: "Yeah, it's a guilty pleasure, shut

181
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:08,710
Speaker 0: up.".

182
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,510
Speaker 1: Though, also, I'm surprised there hasn't been as much backlash from parents yet.

183
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,750
Speaker 1: Just from the fact that a lot of manga are very explicit.

184
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,370
Speaker 1: Very counter to the values of white-bred American society.

185
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think two reasons is-- Parents don't read it, they have no idea.

186
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:23,515
Speaker 0: Parents don't--.

187
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:24,627
Speaker 0: well, that's one I didn't think of.

188
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,970
Speaker 0: One, is it still a little under the radar?

189
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,467
Speaker 1: Think about it.

190
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,287
Speaker 1: Fourteen-year-old Susie comes home and says, "Mommy, I got a new yaoi manga, I'm gonna go read

191
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:31,368
Speaker 1: it.".

192
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,990
Speaker 0: Well, they're not selling the yaoi manga so much in the Borders.

193
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,169
Speaker 1: But they get it at the cons.

194
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,969
Speaker 0: They can get it at the cons.

195
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,909
Speaker 0: But at the cons, you know, they separate it enough.

196
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,850
Speaker 0: And the cons check for that.

197
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,789
Speaker 0: The con knows, you know?

198
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:51,149
Speaker 0: But they do have the Tokyo Pops, and I know some others have a little label on them telling you what the content is.

199
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:52,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one looks at that.

200
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,930
Speaker 1: No one looks at the ESRB anyway.

201
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,969
Speaker 1: They're not gonna look at some book.

202
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,090
Speaker 0: I look at the ESRB, but I guess parents, they don't know.

203
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,686
Speaker 1: It's beyond them, because it's a little more complex than GPG-RX.

204
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,508
Speaker 0: But at least if the parents go to GameStop or a store that checks, like Toys R Us, then someone tells them.

205
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,550
Speaker 0: But if they go to Best Buy, no one tells them.

206
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,036
Speaker 0: They don't know.

207
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,130
Speaker 0: they're, you know?

208
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,869
Speaker 0: But if they go to a GameStop or an EB or a Toys R Us, just because Toys R Us has a thing, but then they'll know.

209
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,028
Speaker 0: But they have labels on them.

210
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:23,289
Speaker 0: And any of them that are really seriously bad-- Or in the shrink wrap.

211
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,389
Speaker 0: They're either in the shrink wrap, or they're on, like, a separate thing, you know?

212
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,948
Speaker 0: Or they just don't even have those that the borders is, and you have to go elsewhere to get them.

213
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,789
Speaker 0: So those Windows fanboys are jumping up and down now.

214
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,830
Speaker 1: Oh, they're gonna make us eat our Lupper?

215
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,310
Speaker 0: That was so bad.

216
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:41,010
Speaker 1: Haha!

217
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:42,810
Speaker 1: I'm making a funny!

218
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,489
Speaker 0: No you're not.

219
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,149
Speaker 0: But there's a Linux worm.

220
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,289
Speaker 0: A Linux worm, oh no.

221
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,391
Speaker 0: Oh!

222
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,830
Speaker 0: But the reality is, of course, that it's not really a flaw in the Linux operating system.

223
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,650
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a flaw in something on the Linux operating system.

224
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,810
Speaker 0: Well, it's a flaw in something that could run on any operating system.

225
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,166
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,530
Speaker 0: The thing is, is that there's some old vulnerabilities for some PHPs and some other web applications.

227
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,309
Speaker 1: Yep, PHP CGI environment.

228
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,370
Speaker 0: Yep, like Drupal, I think, has a flaw.

229
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,710
Speaker 0: And awstats used to have a flaw, but it's been fixed since, like, February or June or something.

230
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:19,143
Speaker 1: Yep.

231
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:20,749
Speaker 0: And someone wrote a worm.

232
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,090
Speaker 0: Basically what it does is it brute forces websites.

233
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,150
Speaker 0: So they type in your URL, and it brute force your domain, and it tries to do all these different URLs at your domain.

234
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,130
Speaker 0: And I've seen these things happen in my web blogs.

235
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,564
Speaker 0: And it's basically, you'll see someone trying to visit, like, /awstats/ a whole bunch of text.

236
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:41,709
Speaker 0: that's random gibberish.

237
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,389
Speaker 0: /drewpaul/ a whole bunch of gibberish.

238
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,350
Speaker 0: And if you actually have the vulnerability, that gibberish will pretty much let them put stuff on your computer.

239
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,790
Speaker 0: So what they do is someone wrote a Linux executable and a BSD executable.

240
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:12,049
Speaker 0: And if you have these gaping holes in your web software on your web server, and they brute force you, and you happen to be unlucky, then they install these executables on your computer in /temp, and then they get run.

241
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:16,550
Speaker 1: Oh, so couldn't I just mount /temp as non-executable?

242
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:21,470
Speaker 0: You could, and that would pretty much prevent you right there, even if you had the vulnerabilities wide open.

243
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,309
Speaker 1: Oh great, I love Linux so much.

244
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, basically the story is that Linux really doesn't have a flaw in the kernel or anything.

245
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:41,070
Speaker 0: It's just that someone found an attack vector that exists in certain circumstances, and finally someone has tried to exploit this vector.

246
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:51,610
Speaker 0: And if someone was running a Windows web server with Apache, or even not Apache, but just PHP, they could inject a Windows executable.

247
00:12:53,172 --> 00:13:00,810
Speaker 0: But someone decided to put a Linux executable and go after LAMP servers, and I guess they must have gotten at least one person.

248
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, Symantec is claiming that I think there are three sites that have reported an infection.

249
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:07,567
Speaker 1: Total?

250
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,249
Speaker 0: Uh, how many did the blaster get back in the day?

251
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:14,388
Speaker 1: All of them?

252
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:15,870
Speaker 0: What about the Nachi?

253
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:30,189
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, see, because I have this problem at work, and a lot of companies seem to have this problem of, they hear that there's no antivirus for Linux, and they freak out, and they demand one.

254
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,549
Speaker 1: So now Symantec makes one.

255
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:37,510
Speaker 1: You can buy, and a bunch of companies are making these little antivirus programs for Linux, and they don't do anything.

256
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:39,028
Speaker 1: They really don't.

257
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:50,270
Speaker 1: They search for, like, old, like, rootkits that used to run on, like, Red Hat 5, or, like, old, old, old vulnerabilities that haven't existed for six or seven years.

258
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:52,269
Speaker 1: Most of them search for Windows viruses.

259
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,550
Speaker 0: Well, though they usually search email attachments.

260
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,769
Speaker 1: That's the intended purpose.

261
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:04,650
Speaker 1: Like, ClamAV is intended to search emails, but a lot of people run it as antivirus, because their corporation said you must have antivirus.

262
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:14,850
Speaker 0: What you do is you have, like, a Linux email server instead of Exchange, and you make sure that no Windows viruses go to the people using Outlook to read your email.

263
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:20,110
Speaker 1: Yep, but a lot of companies demand that there should be antivirus on their Linux machines.

264
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,609
Speaker 0: What do they do if someone uses a Mac?

265
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:23,326
Speaker 1: I don't know.

266
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:33,529
Speaker 1: No one uses a Mac in the business world, and the people who do know what they're doing, and usually you're in some sort of studio where they don't have to worry about some corporate nitwit yelling at them.

267
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:36,225
Speaker 0: What do you do if someone's running, I don't know, AIX?

268
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,569
Speaker 1: AIX isn't vulnerable to viruses.

269
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,599
Speaker 0: What about OS/2?

270
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,509
Speaker 1: OS/2 has antivirus.

271
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,341
Speaker 0: How about HPUX?

272
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,748
Speaker 1: HPUX, actually I did use it once, and one, I hate it.

273
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:52,130
Speaker 1: I hate it more than I hate anything.

274
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:52,785
Speaker 0: All right.

275
00:14:53,290 --> 00:15:00,430
Speaker 1: Though that might have just been the specific server I was working on, and its poorly configured nature as opposed to HPUX in general.

276
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,570
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's just a Unix.

277
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:08,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, this specific HPUX machine I was working on, apparently it had an error on it.

278
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:24,710
Speaker 1: It had some sort of, like, one X wouldn't start, and all these errors every time it booted, and it had been that way for five years, and the sysadmin didn't even know what they meant, or how to fix them, or anything.

279
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,669
Speaker 1: I actually lent him a book on Unix.

280
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:28,808
Speaker 0: Great.

281
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:29,625
Speaker 1: Yeah.

282
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,850
Speaker 1: But the thing is, people don't run HPUX or AIX on their desktop in a corporate environment.

283
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:38,269
Speaker 1: They're on Windows.

284
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:45,829
Speaker 1: And if they're on Linux, a lot of sysadmins who don't know better, and a lot of companies who don't know better, seem to want to treat it as though it's still Windows.

285
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:58,290
Speaker 0: But the thing is that finally there's a worm, so maybe they could say something, but no, it's a worm that won't affect the desktop, because no one runs Apache and PHP on their desktop, unless they're a developer, and if they're a developer you don't have to worry about anything.

286
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:01,949
Speaker 1: Ah, there's some developers who don't know anything.

287
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,610
Speaker 0: Then someone who hired them is very, very dumb.

288
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

289
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,389
Speaker 1: So anyway, my thing of the day.

290
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:12,309
Speaker 0: Oh.

291
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,989
Speaker 1: It's old and it's cool.

292
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,534
Speaker 0: Old?

293
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,807
Speaker 1: Remember Pong?

294
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,370
Speaker 0: No, what's that?

295
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:24,829
Speaker 1: Well, someone posted a bunch of scans of the original original original instruction book that came with Pong.

296
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,210
Speaker 0: From when you bought the big arcade machine to put in your pizza parlor?

297
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:31,886
Speaker 1: No, from when you bought the little home version with the two dials stuck on it.

298
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,607
Speaker 1: That you plug to the TV.

299
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you couldn't even change the game.

300
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:43,426
Speaker 1: Yep, and it was cool, but the one thing that was really cool about it is there's a huge warning in the instruction book from the FCC.

301
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,706
Speaker 1: And remember, I mean, this is before RCA.

302
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:48,325
Speaker 1: This is before cable.

303
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:55,129
Speaker 1: This is when you had those little RF two-prong plugs that you screwed into the back of your TV.

304
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,870
Speaker 0: You mean VHF and UHF?

305
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, all that stuff.

306
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,570
Speaker 1: And remember the Atari's had a little box that you switch it between game and TV?

307
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:02,530
Speaker 0: You mean the RF switch?

308
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:02,975
Speaker 0: Yeah.

309
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,790
Speaker 1: So, they warn you that if you plug Pong in, you have to make sure your antenna's disconnected.

310
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,109
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you have to make sure that there's no wires hanging off of it and that it's not touching any metal.

311
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:22,189
Speaker 1: Because otherwise, you'll broadcast your Pong game to everyone in your neighborhood instead of what they're trying to watch on TV.

312
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess it goes on channel three and the way VHF works is that what comes out of the Pong is what comes in your antenna.

313
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,904
Speaker 0: So, you plug it into the same place.

314
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:33,669
Speaker 0: the antenna goes.

315
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:44,230
Speaker 0: If the antenna is also plugged in, the Pong will send its antenna-like signal up the antenna and it'll broadcast and anyone tuned into channel three might see some of your Pong.

316
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:44,746
Speaker 1: Yeah.

317
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:46,129
Speaker 0: If not all of it.

318
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,629
Speaker 1: The other funny thing is how un-technical people were back then, at least in terms of this sort of thing.

319
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,684
Speaker 1: Because the instruction says the following.

320
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,805
Speaker 1: If your television has four screws on the back, do this.

321
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:00,666
Speaker 1: If your television has a slider on the back, do this.

322
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,944
Speaker 1: If your television has a short round cable, do this.

323
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,949
Speaker 1: They don't even say the proper names of what any of these things are.

324
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:17,425
Speaker 0: No, I remember the NES had a similar thing and it was like if your TV has a red, white, and yellow hole in the back, do this.

325
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:30,390
Speaker 0: And you'll see every instruction book for like a VCR or DVD player now has pictures of all the different things that could be in the back of your stuff and then pictures of all the different ways you can wire it into the back of the DVD player.

326
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:30,780
Speaker 1: True.

327
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:32,890
Speaker 0: It's nothing much different.

328
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,788
Speaker 0: It's just, you know.

329
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I don't notice it.

330
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,209
Speaker 1: I don't look in instruction books.

331
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, not how we know how to wire AV stuff.

332
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,790
Speaker 1: Scarily, I know a lot of people who don't know how to wire AV stuff.

333
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,890
Speaker 0: Those people are just dumb.

334
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:48,730
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, I went to someone's house and we were hanging out and they wanted to watch DVD and they couldn't.

335
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,509
Speaker 1: They're like, "Oh, the DVD player doesn't work.

336
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:51,610
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, Ram.

337
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,389
Speaker 1: You know all that stuff.

338
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,266
Speaker 1: Go fix our DVD

339
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:53,470
Speaker 1: player.".

340
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,288
Speaker 1: So I walk over there and it's just not plugged in.

341
00:18:56,971 --> 00:19:02,606
Speaker 1: So I plug in the RCA cables and I plug them into the TV and then, "Wow, yeah, he knows a lot about that

342
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:02,929
Speaker 1: stuff.".

343
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,889
Speaker 1: And I just didn't even know what to say.

344
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:06,430
Speaker 0: Really?

345
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,050
Speaker 0: That's something they should teach you in school.

346
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:10,190
Speaker 0: How to wire standard AV stuff.

347
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,021
Speaker 1: The worst part is.

348
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,530
Speaker 1: then I was like, "Look, you plug the yellow one into the yellow hole.

349
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,423
Speaker 1: I need to plug the red one into the red

350
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:15,626
Speaker 1: hole.".

351
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,049
Speaker 1: Now, any guesses as to what I do with the white one?

352
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:19,730
Speaker 1: But they stopped me.

353
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,469
Speaker 1: They didn't want to hear it.

354
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:22,248
Speaker 1: Don't give me any of that technical stuff.

355
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,314
Speaker 0: Huh?

356
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,888
Speaker 0: I guess we should start going around town with a business charging money for setting up AV.

357
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,204
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah.

358
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,470
Speaker 1: We could probably make a decent buck.

359
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,587
Speaker 1: Take spyware off of people's computers while we're at it.

360
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:35,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,650
Speaker 0: I saw a thing today of like, "Put the Geek Squad out of business.

362
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,944
Speaker 0: How to be your own Geek Squad using

363
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:41,327
Speaker 0: VNC."

364
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:45,650
Speaker 0: Could happen.

365
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,169
Speaker 0: Oh, my thing of the day?

366
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:51,710
Speaker 0: Oh, so I saw this website today.

367
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:53,068
Speaker 0: It brought me way back.

368
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:54,350
Speaker 0: So far back.

369
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,350
Speaker 0: Farther back than Pong.

370
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,949
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not as far back as Pong.

371
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,909
Speaker 1: Uh, you weren't alive for Pong.

372
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:00,389
Speaker 0: Quiet, you.

373
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:07,763
Speaker 0: It's called... The website, the links all said "Dos Underground," but the website says "Dos

374
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:08,348
Speaker 0: Headquarters.".

375
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:12,891
Speaker 0: This site looks like it's from 1995.

376
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:13,057
Speaker 1: Wow.

377
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,930
Speaker 1: Back when Geocities barely ruled the day.

378
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:17,764
Speaker 0: This is pretty Geocities.

379
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:18,429
Speaker 0: we're talking here.

380
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:22,169
Speaker 0: And like, the front page is just white with text.

381
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:32,910
Speaker 0: But as soon as you go into the site, everything is like weird backgrounds and a bunch of different colors and ugly wavy GIF files and all kinds of stuff.

382
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,850
Speaker 1: It looks like my old Geocities site.

383
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing about this site is despite its old stylings, it's got a whole bunch of information about DOS.

384
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:45,509
Speaker 0: Like, advanced DOS commands.

385
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,664
Speaker 0: Config.sys.

386
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,970
Speaker 0: It had a dual boot with Windows 95.

387
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,650
Speaker 0: Had to modify, like, your command.com with a hex editor to make it do stuff and add commands.

388
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:01,810
Speaker 0: It's pretty crazy.

389
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,870
Speaker 0: And it kind of makes me want to build a DOS computer.

390
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,270
Speaker 0: Like, go get a Pentium 166 and a Voodoo and something.

391
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,890
Speaker 0: And play some DOS games.

392
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,490
Speaker 1: Run some FreeDOS.

393
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,049
Speaker 0: FreeDOS is good.

394
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,060
Speaker 0: Maybe.

395
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:19,769
Speaker 0: I don't know, I've never actually tried it.

396
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:20,950
Speaker 1: It's actually really good.

397
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,009
Speaker 1: I use it for a bunch of things.

398
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,370
Speaker 0: Does it work as well as MS-DOS did back in the day?

399
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:25,570
Speaker 1: It works better than MS-DOS.

400
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:26,568
Speaker 0: Yeah?

401
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,750
Speaker 0: Will it work for, like, DOS games from back in the day perfectly?

402
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I'm running a lot of those actually on FreeDOS in DOS EMU.

403
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,169
Speaker 1: I've gotten all the Quest for Glories to work.

404
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,989
Speaker 1: I've gotten King's Quest 1 to work.

405
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:41,789
Speaker 1: I got, uh... God, what else did I get to work?

406
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,329
Speaker 1: I got Phantasmagoria to work!

407
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,049
Speaker 0: Oh god.

408
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,990
Speaker 1: And it remembers that horrible, god-forsaken game.

409
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:49,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard of it.

410
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,470
Speaker 1: Back when multimedia was the thing.

411
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,568
Speaker 1: You bought a multimedia PC?

412
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,088
Speaker 0: I had a multimedia PC.

413
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,332
Speaker 0: It was a 486.

414
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:56,414
Speaker 1: Oh!

415
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:56,949
Speaker 0: Oh!

416
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,510
Speaker 0: 100 megahertz.

417
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,238
Speaker 1: I had a 2x CD-ROM.

418
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,969
Speaker 0: I had a 4x CD-ROM.

419
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,248
Speaker 0: I was the first kid on the block of the 4x CD-ROM.

420
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:10,042
Speaker 0: And I was... When my computer, when I got it, had 8 megabytes of RAM, I upgraded it to 16 for 40 bucks.

421
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,750
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know about computers.

422
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:14,790
Speaker 1: And my family didn't know either.

423
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,335
Speaker 1: And we got a 486 SX2.

424
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:17,703
Speaker 0: We have a 486 DX4.

425
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,516
Speaker 1: Oh.

426
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,570
Speaker 0: And we got a discount because we knew a guy at IBM.

427
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,748
Speaker 0: Because he's an IBM Aptiva.

428
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:26,570
Speaker 0: But I could install Doom 2 in, like, seconds.

429
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,570
Speaker 0: God, Doom 2?

430
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,770
Speaker 0: And I had 780 megabytes of hard drive space.

431
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:31,910
Speaker 0: It was wicked.

432
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,850
Speaker 1: Wow, you could have copied a whole CD to your hard disk.

433
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,190
Speaker 0: No, I couldn't have because Windows took up all that space.

434
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:37,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,309
Speaker 0: But I remember, it wasn't enough space to fit all my games.

436
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,369
Speaker 0: But I would install games, delete games, install games, delete games.

437
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,909
Speaker 1: Yep, I always used to rotate games in and out.

438
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,430
Speaker 1: When I beat a game, I'd uninstall it.

439
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,750
Speaker 0: But I never had to use a boot disk.

440
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,410
Speaker 1: I had to use a boot disk to play some games.

441
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:52,869
Speaker 0: Never.

442
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,830
Speaker 0: The worst game I had was Super Street Fighter II Turbo.

443
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,930
Speaker 0: And it ran without a boot disk if you had 16 megabytes of RAM.

444
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,691
Speaker 1: Man, I needed a boot disk to run SimCity 2000.

445
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,182
Speaker 0: I was playing MechWarrior 2, right?

446
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,630
Speaker 0: With no boot disk at pretty good resolution and a high frame rate.

447
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:10,229
Speaker 0: In fact-- With no 3D card.

448
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:16,730
Speaker 1: Before I upgraded my RAM, in order to play Doom, I had to hold F5 when I booted so I wouldn't load any drivers.

449
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:18,850
Speaker 1: And I would type "Hi, man.

450
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:20,546
Speaker 1: Mouse.

451
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:22,199
Speaker 1: Doom

452
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:22,871
Speaker 1: 2.".

453
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:25,790
Speaker 0: I was playing Doom 2 in Windows 95 on this computer.

454
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,030
Speaker 0: And it wasn't as good as it is nowadays, but it worked.

455
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:30,730
Speaker 1: I was running Windows 311.

456
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,317
Speaker 0: And I could do it in 640 by 480 with red book audio.

457
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,109
Speaker 1: Graphics and sound.

458
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:38,310
Speaker 0: A spectacle.

459
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,250
Speaker 0: That lasted for about two, three years, and then it turned to poop.

460
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, we seemed to leapfrog each other.

461
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,870
Speaker 1: Like, you had the badass computer, then I had the badass computer.

462
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:49,090
Speaker 1: Then you had the badass computer, then I had the badass computer.

463
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,550
Speaker 1: Right now you have the badass computer.

464
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:52,009
Speaker 0: My computer's not really badass anymore.

465
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:52,469
Speaker 0: Compared to mine.

466
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,869
Speaker 0: Compared to yours, yeah.

467
00:23:54,411 --> 00:24:04,630
Speaker 1: The thing we're recording this on is a freaking Thunderbird gigahertz in like a 60 pound steel tower that has enough space for like 15 drives in it.

468
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,450
Speaker 0: You'll be getting a new computer soon enough.

469
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:08,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause this one started to overheat.

470
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,650
Speaker 0: It's been overheating for years.

471
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was overheating enough to where I finally fixed the problem.

472
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,370
Speaker 1: The computer was overheating a lot, and it would beep at me.

473
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,004
Speaker 1: It'd say like, "Oh, the PC speaker would beep.

474
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:20,185
Speaker 1: It was

475
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:20,648
Speaker 1: overheating.".

476
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:23,428
Speaker 1: So I went into the BIOS and I raised the threshold for the beep.

477
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:25,427
Speaker 0: Way to go.

478
00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:31,850
Speaker 1: So, the Nintendo DS is rocking the house now.

479
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:34,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, absolutely rocking.

480
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,569
Speaker 0: I mean, when it came, I was like, "I'll buy this.

481
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:43,049
Speaker 0: And if it turns out to be a Virtual Boy, I'll be the guy who's got the Virtual

482
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:43,290
Speaker 0: Boy.".

483
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,689
Speaker 1: And you know what?

484
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,929
Speaker 1: A Virtual Boy it is not.

485
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,450
Speaker 0: A Virtual Boy it is so far from, I can't even imagine.

486
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,670
Speaker 0: All these great games came out, and there's more games.

487
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,630
Speaker 0: In like a couple weeks, we're gonna get the Mario Kart.

488
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,090
Speaker 1: They're already coming out so fast.

489
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,169
Speaker 1: I haven't played all of them.

490
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:03,770
Speaker 0: And now, all of a sudden, I see this giant list of new games coming out with screenshots.

491
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,750
Speaker 0: And I haven't even, you know, heard of some of these games.

492
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,369
Speaker 1: And yet, I want to play almost all of them.

493
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:11,250
Speaker 0: It just couldn't be better.

494
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,470
Speaker 0: So, the first game on this list here is Super Princess Peach.

495
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,470
Speaker 1: And I see a picture of Princess Peach.

496
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,870
Speaker 0: She's hitting a Koopa with her umbrella.

497
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:25,150
Speaker 1: It looks like some sort of puzzle-y side scroll-y Mario type game.

498
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,308
Speaker 1: Maybe it'll be like the Wario games.

499
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:28,469
Speaker 0: It might be a little like the Wario games.

500
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,409
Speaker 0: I think it might be a little more puzzle-y because she'll use the umbrella to like, you know, get to places and do things.

501
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,409
Speaker 0: And looks like there's some blocks to break and that kind of thing.

502
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,268
Speaker 1: Animal Crossing, which I'm not that interested in, but it's gonna be online with the Nintendo Wi-Fi.

503
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,410
Speaker 0: A lot of people are gonna play the Animal Crossing.

504
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,530
Speaker 0: Not me, but a lot of other people.

505
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,450
Speaker 0: And I think it's gonna start doing crazy stuff.

506
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:50,170
Speaker 1: I think it will.

507
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,829
Speaker 1: I think this is gonna be the beginning of something big.

508
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,749
Speaker 0: It's gonna get a lot of people to buy some DS's, but they're not me.

509
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,150
Speaker 1: Of course, the next one is also on the Wi-Fi.

510
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,490
Speaker 0: The Mario Kart.

511
00:25:58,792 --> 00:25:59,930
Speaker 1: Oh, Mario Kart!

512
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:03,709
Speaker 0: Mario Kart is gonna... Oh my god, I don't even know.

513
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,430
Speaker 1: So some people have already released the list of characters that are playable in the Mario Kart.

514
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,710
Speaker 0: Well, there's the eight ones that are standard.

515
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,469
Speaker 1: Yep, and then there's the unlockables.

516
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,010
Speaker 0: The eight secret characters.

517
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,130
Speaker 1: Which, if we talk about them now, it'll be a spoiler.

518
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:17,409
Speaker 0: That's fine.

519
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:18,530
Speaker 1: We're spoiling.

520
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,670
Speaker 0: The most secretest character is Rob the Robot.

521
00:26:21,851 --> 00:26:22,346
Speaker 0: Rob the Robot!

522
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,248
Speaker 1: Rob the Robot!

523
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:24,650
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

524
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:27,110
Speaker 1: I can't believe I'll be able to race as Rob the Robot.

525
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:28,429
Speaker 1: You know what?

526
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:36,210
Speaker 1: What if they could set it up so that if you play Rob the Robot, there's gotta be something where they'll do the flashes, and if you actually have a Rob, it'll do something.

527
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:37,217
Speaker 1: No.

528
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,648
Speaker 1: Just hold the DS up to it.

529
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,072
Speaker 0: No.

530
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,709
Speaker 1: There's gotta be an Easter egg.

531
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:41,407
Speaker 0: There isn't.

532
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,088
Speaker 1: There's gotta be.

533
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,394
Speaker 1: No.

534
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,650
Speaker 0: But, man, like, in the original Mario Kart, I was always Toad, Koopa Troopa, or Luigi.

535
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,530
Speaker 0: Then, when it came out for the GBA, which is the best one, I say, and I'm the master of that game, by the way.

536
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:55,947
Speaker 0: He is.

537
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,910
Speaker 1: Normally I dispute him, but he beats everyone.

538
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:02,190
Speaker 0: I beat everyone at that game because I played it so much, the GBA Super Circuit Mario Kart.

539
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:03,246
Speaker 0: I'm always Luigi.

540
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:12,250
Speaker 0: I was gonna be Luigi all the time now, too, but now, not only is there gonna be Rob the Robot, but there's Koopa Troopa and Dry Bones.

541
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:13,228
Speaker 1: Oh, Dry Bones.

542
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:15,230
Speaker 0: I kinda wanna be Dry Bones.

543
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:18,129
Speaker 0: I'll have to go by how the cars drive.

544
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,550
Speaker 0: That's all I have to make my decision.

545
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,889
Speaker 1: And, of course, now two people can be the same guy.

546
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:22,886
Speaker 1: So, uh.

547
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:23,988
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

548
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,730
Speaker 1: So, if you won't have any of that, I'm Luigi.

549
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:28,570
Speaker 1: But I'm Luigi.

550
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,470
Speaker 0: Dump dump.

551
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,230
Speaker 1: You can both be Luigi.

552
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,908
Speaker 1: It's okay.

553
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,650
Speaker 0: All right, Mario.

554
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,703
Speaker 0: I just hope that this one, uh.

555
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,730
Speaker 0: I played it a little bit, but not enough to get a definitive answer.

556
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:44,870
Speaker 0: The Super Circuit GBA one was a racing game first and an item game second.

557
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:47,689
Speaker 0: If you were the racing master, items couldn't affect you.

558
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:54,510
Speaker 0: Most of the GameCube one and the N64 one, you know, there's a lot more luck factor.

559
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,950
Speaker 0: 'Cause if you get the right items, you can win, even if you didn't drive as perfectly well.

560
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,989
Speaker 0: I mean, terrible driving, you won't win.

561
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,830
Speaker 0: But you can have good enough driving, even though it might not be better than the other guy.

562
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,249
Speaker 0: If you get better items, you'll win.

563
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,110
Speaker 0: I want the GBA one, since it's online competitive play.

564
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,110
Speaker 0: I mean, the DS one, to have whoever's the best racer wins.

565
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,930
Speaker 0: The items just make it fun, but they don't affect the outcome heavily.

566
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,208
Speaker 1: Well, we'll have to see.

567
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:22,510
Speaker 1: I'll buy it regardless.

568
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:25,130
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm totally buying it the day it comes out, no matter what.

569
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,430
Speaker 0: I'm totally buying Mario & Luigi Partners in Time the day it comes out, no matter what.

570
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,448
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, yep.

571
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:37,290
Speaker 0: I bought Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga for the GBA, and it was like Mario RPG times a thousand.

572
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,490
Speaker 1: I haven't even played it yet.

573
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:39,870
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you gotta play it.

574
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:40,270
Speaker 0: I will.

575
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,225
Speaker 0: And now they're coming out with the DS one.

576
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:42,870
Speaker 0: that's even better.

577
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:43,710
Speaker 0: I played it a little bit.

578
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:44,469
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

579
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:50,729
Speaker 0: If you haven't played Mario RPG or Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, go get an SNES.

580
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:53,730
Speaker 1: Or an emulator.

581
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:54,630
Speaker 0: Or whatever.

582
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:56,510
Speaker 0: Don't break the law.

583
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,529
Speaker 0: I don't want to go to jail.

584
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,570
Speaker 0: Get a GBA, play Mario & Luigi.

585
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,069
Speaker 0: These games are so great.

586
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,730
Speaker 0: I mean, well, they're Paper Mario also.

587
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,489
Speaker 0: All those games, you might think, "Oh, they put the Mario label on to sell a

588
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:09,770
Speaker 0: game.".

589
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:11,030
Speaker 0: No, it's really great.

590
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:16,310
Speaker 0: And I don't like RPGs so much anymore, because they can't really handle the grinding.

591
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,045
Speaker 0: And they do have leveling up, but it's so easy.

592
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,110
Speaker 0: There's no effort at all.

593
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:23,747
Speaker 0: It's just great.

594
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,389
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm looking at this Mario basketball three-on-three.

595
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:29,470
Speaker 0: I like Mario.

596
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,990
Speaker 1: The picture I see Mario dribbling on a coin block, and coins are coming out.

597
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,709
Speaker 1: Luigi's about to throw a shell at him.

598
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:36,348
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

599
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:38,030
Speaker 0: Oh, I want this game.

600
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,650
Speaker 0: I remember NBA Jam was the last basketball game that I could really stomach.

601
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,729
Speaker 0: And they did release that NBA something-something for the GameCube that had Mario characters, but I never played it.

602
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,530
Speaker 0: And it was just mostly a basketball game that happened to have Mario characters.

603
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:51,802
Speaker 1: Yep.

604
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:01,010
Speaker 0: I hope this one, if it turns out to be more NBA Jam awesome, Mario Tennis-like, it could be good, or it could also be crap.

605
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:02,710
Speaker 1: I imagine it'll be good.

606
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,709
Speaker 1: If not, even if it's not that good, it's still a multiplayer wireless game for the DS.

607
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,485
Speaker 0: Yep.

608
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,690
Speaker 1: The wirelessness adds a lot to it, I found.

609
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,469
Speaker 0: Definitely adds a lot.

610
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:16,549
Speaker 1: Remember the days of sitting around huddled in a tiny group before trying to play with those Game Boy cables?

611
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:19,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, the original Game Boy cable wasn't so good.

612
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,847
Speaker 0: You need a little base thingy, and you could play F1 racing.

613
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,230
Speaker 0: Then the GBA fixed it because you could combine four people with only three cables.

614
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:27,515
Speaker 1: Yep.

615
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:35,030
Speaker 0: It was a little better, and we actually had the cables, but it still had to be real close to each other, and the cables fell out and didn't quite work.

616
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,970
Speaker 1: Yep, and there was a lot of latency.

617
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:38,189
Speaker 1: The cables really weren't that good.

618
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:45,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now the DS wireless works really well, except for like one time when it just crapped out for no reason.

619
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:50,890
Speaker 1: We were playing some game, I think it was Advance Wars against each other, and then suddenly we lost our connection.

620
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,550
Speaker 1: Like, a pulse must have gone through the room or something.

621
00:30:55,672 --> 00:31:00,310
Speaker 0: Who knows, but it works great 99% of the time, and I'm sure it'll work well enough.

622
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:00,820
Speaker 1: Yep.

623
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:07,470
Speaker 0: You know, of all these games, the one that I'm actually looking forward to the most is the new Super Mario Brothers.

624
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,830
Speaker 1: Yep, it's a side-scrolling Mario Brothers.

625
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:17,289
Speaker 0: The first 2D side-scrolling Mario Brothers game since like Mario World or Yoshi's Island or something.

626
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:35,390
Speaker 0: And, you know, they're incorporating all kinds of things, like, you know, making Mario even bigger, and Mario and Luigi playing the same level at the same time together and racing to the end, and, you know, collecting like items and using them whenever you want, and oh, it's gonna be great.

627
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:42,790
Speaker 1: Because there's been such a call for the old 2D games, because they're not so graphically intensive or super 3D, but they're still good games.

628
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:56,449
Speaker 0: There was a recent clamor as some guy realized that amidst all this Nintendo action, that we had Metroid Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion, but now there's no more 2D Metroid games on the books to come out soon, and everyone's like, "Hey!

629
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,708
Speaker 0: You forgot one!

630
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,710
Speaker 0: Make it the other 2D Metroid game!

631
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,387
Speaker 0: At least release Super Metroid for the DS or the revolution or

632
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:04,808
Speaker 0: something.".

633
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,502
Speaker 0: You know?

634
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,650
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, even think, the most top-selling game ever in the history of gaming was Mario.

635
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:13,730
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know.

636
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,910
Speaker 0: I think the Sims or maybe something might have beat it out.

637
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,249
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

638
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,430
Speaker 1: It's at least the number one console game.

639
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:17,928
Speaker 0: It's huge.

640
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:18,947
Speaker 0: It's huge.

641
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:19,948
Speaker 0: Mario 3 was huge.

642
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,386
Speaker 1: Yeah.

643
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:30,452
Speaker 0: If you look at the, like, on Game Facts, they recently did a survey of, like, the top 100 games, and there were, like, seven or eight Mario games in the top 20.

644
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:31,409
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

645
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:32,768
Speaker 0: Mario is it.

646
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:40,769
Speaker 1: Of course, with Metroid, I'm kind of looking forward to the new Metroid Hunters, Prime Hunters, because this is supposedly the one where they fixed all the issues people had with that demo.

647
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, everyone, you know, said the demo was poop.

648
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,689
Speaker 1: Because it was.

649
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:52,009
Speaker 0: And it was poop, and Nintendo actually recognized, and everyone said it was poop, and supposedly they've done a lot to un-poop it.

650
00:32:52,712 --> 00:33:07,689
Speaker 0: I don't know how much they could do while keeping it in FPS and whatever, but I think they might actually turn it into a game that I want to play, and I might, you know, if I don't buy it brand new, I'll probably buy it used, or soon after when it's not brand new anymore.

651
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not going to buy it new, because I got enough games to play.

652
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,230
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't come out for a long time.

653
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,550
Speaker 0: Like, it'll be next year.

654
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:15,010
Speaker 0: We'll see.

655
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,790
Speaker 0: They're pacing the games, really.

656
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then we got it for it.

657
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,588
Speaker 1: There's also the GameCube games coming out.

658
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:22,170
Speaker 1: Like, Twilight Princess.

659
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,769
Speaker 0: That's the only GameCube game coming out.

660
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,450
Speaker 0: Twilight Princess.

661
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:24,948
Speaker 0: That's it.

662
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:25,569
Speaker 0: Twilight Princess.

663
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,330
Speaker 0: That's it.

664
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,270
Speaker 0: There's no other GameCube games coming out.

665
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:28,650
Speaker 0: It's dead.

666
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,530
Speaker 1: Twilight Princess.

667
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, but that doesn't matter.

668
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,290
Speaker 0: It's not, I don't think that it's even coming out near when Metroid Prime Hunters is coming.

669
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,808
Speaker 1: No, it probably isn't.

670
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,590
Speaker 0: The thing is, they're pacing the DS games really well.

671
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,689
Speaker 0: It's like, one comes out, you wait a month, you get another one.

672
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:42,949
Speaker 0: Comes out in a month, you get another one.

673
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,888
Speaker 0: You know, sometimes you get two.

674
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:45,576
Speaker 1: Yep.

675
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:53,989
Speaker 0: The thing is, is that if they really make great games, and, you know, I might end up playing Mario Kart for months and months and months and not need another game.

676
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:00,869
Speaker 0: Or I might get Mario Kart, but then I'll get all these other games, and I won't have enough time for Mario Kart, and I won't be happy.

677
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,729
Speaker 0: You know?

678
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:04,549
Speaker 0: I hope that's not what happens.

679
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:04,918
Speaker 1: Yep.

680
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,729
Speaker 1: There's just so many games.

681
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:20,829
Speaker 0: And there's a Wario game, and I've gotten every Wario game since Wario 2, 2, 3, and 4, and while Wario 2 is the best Wario and it decreased in quality since, I just, for some reason I have to buy every Wario game.

682
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:22,510
Speaker 1: You don't have WarioWare.

683
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:27,268
Speaker 0: All the normal side-scrolling 2D Wario games.

684
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,188
Speaker 0: You know, the real Wario games.

685
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,690
Speaker 1: It's a real Wario.

686
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:53,127
Speaker 0: You know where Wario actually comes from is, Nintendo had different divisions of development, and the division that was working on the Game Boy Marios, they made Super Mario Land, then they made Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, which Wario was the boss, and then they made Wario Land, which was Super Mario Land 3, because they were trying to compete against Miyamoto's team.

687
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,944
Speaker 0: So they were like, "Oh, we are the Wario

688
00:34:55,984 --> 00:34:56,145
Speaker 0: team!".

689
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:09,610
Speaker 0: You know, you can read the whole story online in different places, but it's actually pretty interesting what goes on, what went on inside Nintendo in those days, and what happened to games like Kid Icarus and such.

690
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:10,668
Speaker 1: Oh, Kid Icarus.

691
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:11,730
Speaker 1: I hated that game.

692
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,306
Speaker 1: I loved that game, but I hated that game.

693
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,310
Speaker 0: I never got past, like, the first level.

694
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,689
Speaker 1: It was one of the hardest games ever.

695
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,046
Speaker 0: Silver Surfer.

696
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,230
Speaker 1: Eh, Kid Icarus is kinda up there.

697
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,388
Speaker 0: It's up there.

698
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,449
Speaker 0: It's no Silver Surfer.

699
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:23,999
Speaker 1: Nah.

700
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,430
Speaker 1: Because Kid Icarus, you didn't die right away.

701
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,590
Speaker 1: It took you a while to die, but you still died.

702
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,249
Speaker 1: Silver Surfer killed you immediately.

703
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:32,670
Speaker 0: Not quite immediately.

704
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,789
Speaker 0: Depends on your skill level.

705
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,090
Speaker 1: I never got more than about 20 seconds into that game.

706
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:38,870
Speaker 0: Oh, you're just no good.

707
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:44,127
Speaker 1: The one I'm really actually kinda looking forward to, the more I look at it, is the Resident Evil one.

708
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,710
Speaker 0: Eh, you know, there's like a bunch of Resident Evil games, and they're all kinda the same.

709
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:54,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the one thing I'm really thinking is that it has wireless multiplayer co-op mode.

710
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,450
Speaker 0: So you all fight zombies together?

711
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:05,607
Speaker 1: And since it's not a split screen, like on a GameCube, you can just actually have some multiplayer co-op go into different rooms, you know, co-op.

712
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,389
Speaker 1: Something that I've missed.

713
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:10,110
Speaker 1: Ever since the days I used to co-op through Doom 2 with people.

714
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:16,390
Speaker 0: There are definitely not enough games with co-op mode, and the DS definitely is ripe for many games of co-oping.

715
00:36:17,151 --> 00:36:18,469
Speaker 0: And the more they make, the better.

716
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:27,543
Speaker 0: Especially a game like Resident Evil actually is perfect for co-op because, you know, one guy goes collecting an item, another guy gets the key, another guy kills the zombies, you know.

717
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:28,989
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

718
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:29,498
Speaker 1: Yup.

719
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,005
Speaker 0: Advance Wars kinda has co-op, but not for the campaign.

720
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,489
Speaker 1: No, we have to make our own co-op.

721
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:37,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not so great.

722
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,788
Speaker 1: 'Cause I always win.

723
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:39,859
Speaker 0: No.

724
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:46,839
Speaker 1: Tony Hawk, eh, I'm not that interested in.

725
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,260
Speaker 1: But not to diss those games, I just don't like those games.

726
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:52,540
Speaker 0: I'm not liking those games so much, I think.

727
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,560
Speaker 1: Bleach, I don't like Bleach, and I'm not that interested in the game.

728
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people are huge fans of that anime.

729
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Speaker 1: A lot of our friends are gonna nut over this game.

730
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:05,420
Speaker 0: It's just a fighting game, you know, it's a fighting anime.

731
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:13,780
Speaker 0: I don't like the fighting animes, I don't understand why people like them, but the fact that they're actually selling the anime games in this country now shows something.

732
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,017
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty good.

733
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,319
Speaker 1: Well, the one thing that Bleach has got going for is that one of the characters looks exactly like a friend of ours.

734
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:23,099
Speaker 1: Like, exactly.

735
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,117
Speaker 0: Really?

736
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:24,991
Speaker 1: 100%, one for one.

737
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:26,780
Speaker 0: Okay, that's great.

738
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kinda cool.

739
00:37:28,084 --> 00:37:28,150
Speaker 0: Eh.

740
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,159
Speaker 0: Anyone can find someone in an anime somewhere who looks like them.

741
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:33,236
Speaker 1: Yeah.

742
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:40,739
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, there's Xenosaga, which isn't really up your alley, but I've been hurtin' for an old-school RPG-type game.

743
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,739
Speaker 0: Well, if you want an old-school RPG-type game, they're putting out Final Fantasy III Remade for the DS.

744
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:46,359
Speaker 0: Yes!

745
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:54,920
Speaker 0: The game that has never been released in America, they're gonna make it 3D, they're gonna add heck to make the plot understandable.

746
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,540
Speaker 1: Yep, they're making it look a lot like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles looked.

747
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:07,839
Speaker 0: That's cool, because at least then they'll keep some sort of separate identity from PlayStation, Xbox, Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy XI, whatever.

748
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,520
Speaker 1: Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of this game.

749
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,759
Speaker 1: This is an old-school Final Fantasy.

750
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:15,739
Speaker 1: It's probably the second hardest after Final Fantasy V.

751
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,940
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're gonna keep it as hard as they did, because remember when they released 1 and 2 for the PlayStation on that CD, they kinda made it easier?

752
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:24,651
Speaker 1: Yeah.

753
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,189
Speaker 1: Yeah.

754
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,720
Speaker 1: I remember playing through that game with a hacked, semi-English translated ROM on Nesticle.

755
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,780
Speaker 0: It can't be any harder than Secret of Mana.

756
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,520
Speaker 0: I don't know how people played this game.

757
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,460
Speaker 0: I tried to play it the other day, and I just couldn't get anywhere.

758
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:43,239
Speaker 0: So tedious and difficult.

759
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,780
Speaker 1: It's just, I don't know why people thought it was so-- Yeah, if I can describe the game in one word, it's tedious.

760
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,060
Speaker 0: I mean, I knew the game was supposedly so great.

761
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,620
Speaker 0: Secret of Mana was huge.

762
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,278
Speaker 0: You got big billings and great reviews and people loved it, but now I don't know how anyone played it.

763
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:02,620
Speaker 1: 'Cause when I was that age, when it came out, I had infinite free time.

764
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,440
Speaker 1: I had nothing better to do than kill a cute furry bunny a thousand times until I get the five gold I need to buy the next thing to kill the next furry bunny.

765
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:21,740
Speaker 0: Well, they're putting a Mana game on the DS, Children of Mana, which I know absolutely nothing about other than it looks a lot like Secret of Mana, only modern.

766
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:22,330
Speaker 0: Yep.

767
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,119
Speaker 0: And hopefully it's not as tedious.

768
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,740
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta say, the game's a lot less tedious once you get a partner.

769
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,719
Speaker 1: 'Cause I only beat the game 'cause I played it with my-- Yeah, yeah.

770
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,280
Speaker 0: Well, once I got a partner in the game, the partner always died.

771
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,540
Speaker 1: That's 'cause you need another person to sit there and play the partner for you.

772
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,400
Speaker 0: Otherwise-- I've never done it with a person, but we could try it.

773
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Speaker 1: It's a lot more fun that way.

774
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:48,939
Speaker 1: Without the AI, your partner will either stand at the back and watch you die, or run in front of you and die while you watch.

775
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:53,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's try it with a-- Maybe I can beat it then if we're both playing and I have a partner.

776
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:54,977
Speaker 0: We'll try it.

777
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,300
Speaker 1: Some Guilty Gear game, Monkey Ball, racing game.

778
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:07,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, eventually people say there's gonna be a Zelda game.

779
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:10,927
Speaker 1: Yep, Metroid Dread, which is supposed to be 2D.

780
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:14,910
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, so I guess someone-- At some point.

781
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,149
Speaker 1: I mean, this is obviously way off.

782
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,950
Speaker 0: Oh, so the Metroid Dread was sort of announced.

783
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,130
Speaker 0: All right, so there will be a 2D Metroid game.

784
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,189
Speaker 1: Yep, we don't know when or what.

785
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,769
Speaker 0: Despite people saying otherwise on forums today.

786
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,090
Speaker 1: Oh, A New Castlevania, great.

787
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:34,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause the one you've got, you know, is just asking for-- Oh, they're gonna bring more Phoenix Wright!

788
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,268
Speaker 0: Thank God!

789
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:42,068
Speaker 0: Oh my God, they could bring so much Phoenix Wright that it would be coming out my ears and I would buy every single one of them.

790
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:45,410
Speaker 1: I haven't even played it yet, I've only heard you talk about it.

791
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:51,385
Speaker 0: When you play it, you're probably gonna have to do a whole extra podcast just so you can go, "Oh my God, it's so great, oh my

792
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:51,648
Speaker 0: God.".

793
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:56,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, the DS is just so amazing.

794
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:02,030
Speaker 0: If they can do the same thing with the revolution, I think Microsoft and Sony are gonna be hurting.

795
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:12,645
Speaker 0: Except, 'cause they're pretty much gonna be stuck with, you know, the teen boy market MTV watching kids, and everybody else is gonna be Nintendo DSes and revolutions.

796
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,210
Speaker 1: 'Cause look at who plays NES games now, or not NES, but Nintendo games.

797
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:28,810
Speaker 1: Our generation, the people who were old enough to grow up on Nintendo, and young kids who are currently growing up on Nintendo, there's only that middle gap that grew up on the PS1 with Final Fantasy VII and on.

798
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,229
Speaker 0: And you know what I realized today?

799
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:39,770
Speaker 0: It was such a small thing, but back in the day, there was the SNES and they were working on the SNES CD, and they cancelled it, and that's where the PlayStation came from.

800
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,648
Speaker 0: It was originally the SNES CD.

801
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:49,930
Speaker 0: And Square jumped from the SNES and the N64 to the PlayStation to Final Fantasy VII.

802
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,530
Speaker 1: Full motion video, which is tough to do on a cartridge, and some other reasons.

803
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,207
Speaker 1: They actually had kind of a falling out.

804
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:55,748
Speaker 0: Right.

805
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,289
Speaker 0: Little falling out.

806
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:57,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

807
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:11,109
Speaker 0: If Nintendo would have kept the CD, or if Square would have stuck with them, or if Square would have went to the Saturn, or it was such a tiny, tiny thing, when it happened, no one really made a big deal out of it.

808
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,746
Speaker 0: They were just like, "Sony's making this thing called the

809
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:14,250
Speaker 0: PlayStation.".

810
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,792
Speaker 0: Nintendo's coming out at the end of Nintendo 64.

811
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:18,930
Speaker 0: Dolphin, you know, whatever.

812
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,749
Speaker 0: It was codenamed Dolphin, I think it was.

813
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,570
Speaker 0: And then they were like, "Yeah, the Saturn's out.

814
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,969
Speaker 0: It's got some cool games.

815
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:27,958
Speaker 0: Knights is

816
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,326
Speaker 0: cool.".

817
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,146
Speaker 0: Whatever, you know.

818
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:34,510
Speaker 0: And then the PlayStation came out, and it wasn't really until Final Fantasy VII.

819
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:41,370
Speaker 0: It was one company making one game with one bad move by Nintendo is the only reason.

820
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,470
Speaker 0: the way things are today.

821
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:50,649
Speaker 0: If it had happened differently, Nintendo would still have this tremendous monopoly over all console gaming, and we probably wouldn't have a revolution or a DS.

822
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:56,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of like Nintendo got knocked down a bit, and now they're surging forward with full power.

823
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,937
Speaker 0: That just shows that their position is like kings of gaming in the 80s and 90s wasn't unfounded.

824
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:17,530
Speaker 1: Well, plus, having that position back then, they had, I mean, they're still one of the most profitable corporations in the world in terms of profit or revenue versus expenditure.

825
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:22,669
Speaker 1: I mean, every game they sell is a crazy hit, and they make a lot of money off of it.

826
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,630
Speaker 1: They don't even need to worry about the third-party developers.

827
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,350
Speaker 0: Yep.

828
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:35,470
Speaker 1: And a lot of people say that's a bad thing, but frankly, I don't cry when Atari's latest pile of feces doesn't make it to the GameCube.

829
00:43:37,454 --> 00:43:38,169
Speaker 0: Look at the PlayStation.

830
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:44,090
Speaker 0: They've got like 20 million consoles out there, but when they have a big selling game, it sells a million, a couple million.

831
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,948
Speaker 1: But yet, when Soul Calibur II came out for all three systems...

832
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,710
Speaker 0: GameCube sold the most, well, that was because it had Link.

833
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:58,330
Speaker 0: But if you look, there are so many millions of GameCubes out there, but when a game comes out for the GameCube like Wind Waker, they sell one copy for almost every GameCube.

834
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,891
Speaker 1: Yep.

835
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:01,990
Speaker 1: You can't tell me there are many games that everyone who owns a PlayStation has.

836
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,810
Speaker 0: I mean, you look at the biggest PlayStation games, probably GTA.

837
00:44:05,011 --> 00:44:09,070
Speaker 0: I say maybe 10% of PlayStations have GTA.

838
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:12,723
Speaker 0: If there was GTA for the GameCube, 100% of GameCubes would have GTA.

839
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:15,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'd probably have it.

840
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,470
Speaker 1: Buy in the discount bin or something, but we'd have it.

841
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not really a big fan.

842
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,350
Speaker 0: You know, I played GTA 1, the original.

843
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:21,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

844
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,410
Speaker 0: And then as soon as it made 3D, it just wasn't the same.

845
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,490
Speaker 0: It was a different kind of game.

846
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,610
Speaker 1: I gotta say, I like the one set in Britain the most.

847
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's definitely the best one.

848
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:29,850
Speaker 1: That was what, 2?

849
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:34,461
Speaker 0: That was the expansion pack to 1.

850
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:36,959
Speaker 1: Though that's the one thing we've been playing a lot of old games lately.

851
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,659
Speaker 0: Got the emulator hooked up on the PC, plugged into the TV.

852
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,020
Speaker 1: Yep, and we got the old, we haven't got the Atari.

853
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,938
Speaker 1: We haven't hooked it up yet.

854
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,199
Speaker 0: Eh, it's not so many games in the Atari.

855
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,380
Speaker 0: You're like the kaboom.

856
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:50,098
Speaker 1: I like the kaboom.

857
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,640
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan of the kaboom so much.

858
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,637
Speaker 0: I like the combat, but I...

859
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:55,760
Speaker 1: How about the Western game?

860
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,720
Speaker 0: The Western game is Outlaw.

861
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,159
Speaker 0: Outlaw is a great game.

862
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:00,219
Speaker 0: I love Outlaw.

863
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,879
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to hook the Atari up so we can play that.

864
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:03,339
Speaker 0: I'll totally Outlaw you.

865
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,833
Speaker 0: I gotta go get a freakin' 2600 controller.

866
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,480
Speaker 0: I can't take the stupid 57.

867
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,559
Speaker 1: But then you'll only have one button.

868
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,369
Speaker 1: You can't play the 7800 games.

869
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,720
Speaker 0: Oh, Pole Position.

870
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:12,719
Speaker 0: I can't play.

871
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:13,377
Speaker 0: Oh no.

872
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,240
Speaker 1: Pole Position was a crappy game.

873
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,740
Speaker 0: Pole Position was actually a great game.

874
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:17,116
Speaker 1: It was okay.

875
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,464
Speaker 0: And you have Pole Position 2, I think, for the 7800.

876
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:21,520
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, I had two.

877
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,179
Speaker 1: I did have two.

878
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,540
Speaker 0: Pole Position 2 is actually a little better, but Pole Position in the arcade can't be beat.

879
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:26,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

880
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,780
Speaker 0: Seriously, except maybe my Initial D.

881
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:35,419
Speaker 1: Initial D. While we were playing, our thing this last couple days were old sports games.

882
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:37,118
Speaker 0: Uh, oh yeah.

883
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:48,219
Speaker 1: 'Cause we really, one, in my opinion, while it is not an accurate representation of the sport for which it is named, ice hockey for the NES is probably my favorite sports game ever.

884
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,500
Speaker 0: It's the best sports game ever.

885
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:50,339
Speaker 0: It's like a fact.

886
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,399
Speaker 0: And everyone knows it.

887
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:58,078
Speaker 0: We were waiting in line to see Miyamoto, who we didn't get to see, but some other guy was just like, "Ice hockey is the best freakin'

888
00:45:58,098 --> 00:45:58,359
Speaker 0: game.".

889
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:00,259
Speaker 0: Everyone knows it.

890
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:02,380
Speaker 0: We're just waiting for ice hockey 2.

891
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,260
Speaker 1: It's the only hockey game for a console where you physically feel pain from playing it.

892
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,020
Speaker 1: My thumb, I don't know what happens, but 30 seconds into that game, my thumb is burning and I can barely move my guys anymore.

893
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,860
Speaker 0: Well, that's because they tried to simulate ice by making the guys, you know, swoosh around.

894
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,220
Speaker 1: So the puck's in the middle and you're swooshing in a circle, but you can't get the puck.

895
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,639
Speaker 0: And you can't really control your guys.

896
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,640
Speaker 0: You know, the puck will be right near you.

897
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:30,800
Speaker 0: You control the goalie really precisely, but because you're doing that, you can't really control your guys to bring them in to defend, and then it, you know.

898
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:31,759
Speaker 1: Or the vaulted.

899
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,540
Speaker 1: You gotta hit B five times, then your defenseman will come to your aid.

900
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then you're jamming the whole bunch all over the place and stuff isn't happening the way you want.

901
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,740
Speaker 1: And yet despite all that, I managed to score, what, 11 goals on you?

902
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:45,120
Speaker 0: I scored plenty of goals.

903
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:47,059
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, like four.

904
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh, I've beaten you at this game severely in the past.

905
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:52,300
Speaker 1: I've also beaten you severely in the past.

906
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:54,150
Speaker 0: I once beat my cousin 125 to, like, almost nothing.

907
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:57,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't top that.

908
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,800
Speaker 0: I don't know how I did it.

909
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,420
Speaker 0: I think we set it to the really long periods and the really fast play.

910
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,772
Speaker 1: Yep.

911
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:03,817
Speaker 0: And yeah.

912
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:07,520
Speaker 1: We also played, uh, Blades of Steel, which is still a good game.

913
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,378
Speaker 0: Blades of Steel is actually a real hot game.

914
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:15,700
Speaker 0: We played to a dead standstill, and then- Uh, only, it was only dead standstill because I scored two goals on myself.

915
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott scored two goals on himself.

916
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:19,317
Speaker 1: I don't know how he did it.

917
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:21,220
Speaker 0: It's because it's an old NES game.

918
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,065
Speaker 0: I'm using this crap.

919
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,020
Speaker 0: grab his game pad, you know, it's what happens.

920
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:28,560
Speaker 0: I think I might buy the Xbox 360 controller that goes into the computer.

921
00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:33,000
Speaker 0: They're gonna be on sale this week, but I don't- I don't know how much money they'll be this week.

922
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,598
Speaker 0: I might wait.

923
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:34,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

924
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,279
Speaker 0: They might be too expensive this week.

925
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,040
Speaker 1: But- I'm interested.

926
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,739
Speaker 1: I'll let you buy it first, see how well it works.

927
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,039
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna also wait to see what the Linux news on it is.

928
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, because right now I got my grab his game pad.

929
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,660
Speaker 1: It works, but it doesn't have a plus for the, uh, digital, uh, movement.

930
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,060
Speaker 0: I don't think the Xbox 360 has a plus either, does it?

931
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:50,900
Speaker 1: I think it does.

932
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,919
Speaker 0: I think it has two analogs.

933
00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:55,197
Speaker 1: Uh, it's gotta have some sort of- I actually haven't looked at it.

934
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,318
Speaker 1: If anything, I'll buy a Licksang device and plug an SNES controller into that, and then I'll be good to go.

935
00:48:03,803 --> 00:48:08,560
Speaker 1: I'd rather go with, uh- And I can plug my DualShock into another Licksang thing if I need an analog.

936
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,979
Speaker 0: It'd be cool if I could get a GameCube controller in there.

937
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,419
Speaker 0: That would be- That would be cool.

938
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:15,560
Speaker 0: I haven't seen a device that does that yet, though.

939
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:18,240
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, Licksang probably has something.

940
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:18,680
Speaker 1: I left it alone.

941
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:23,220
Speaker 0: So, oh, the other game we were playing was freaking Tech Mobile, which you had never played before.

942
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,819
Speaker 1: No, and yet somehow I was, uh, whooping you.

943
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,837
Speaker 0: Oh, it's Super Tech Mobile, but not a regular, regular Tecmo Super Bowl for the NES.

944
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,260
Speaker 0: That was just one of the best football ga- The best football game ever.

945
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,440
Speaker 1: See, I never had it when I was little.

946
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:38,880
Speaker 1: Like, Michigan, it was hockey time.

947
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:39,718
Speaker 0: I didn't have it.

948
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,060
Speaker 0: My, uh, cousins had it.

949
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:41,920
Speaker 1: No one I knew had it.

950
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,300
Speaker 1: We all had ice hockey.

951
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,660
Speaker 0: Uh, we had ice hockey, but we also had the football game.

952
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:54,100
Speaker 0: And Super Tech Mobile, there are people to this day, I hear- that they're football guys.

953
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:01,640
Speaker 0: The kind, you know, face painting no shirt, wearing painting letters on themselves, going to football games, tailgating guys.

954
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:07,360
Speaker 0: And when, before they watch a game on TV, they play it in Tecmo Super Bowl for the NES.

955
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,980
Speaker 0: To this day, I've heard different people say that they do this independent of another.

956
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,418
Speaker 0: So I gotta say- At least three times.

957
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,300
Speaker 1: No one plays track and field before the Olympics.

958
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,820
Speaker 0: No one plays track and field before the Olympics.

959
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,660
Speaker 1: No one had a power pad.

960
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,137
Speaker 0: You know why?

961
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,820
Speaker 0: Because that would require someone to watch the Olympics, which no one does.

962
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,920
Speaker 1: I had a power pad.

963
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,119
Speaker 1: Never had the game that used the other side of the power pad.

964
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,200
Speaker 0: There was a game that actually used the other side?

965
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was some aerobics game.

966
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,179
Speaker 1: It was like DDR of aerobics.

967
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:35,855
Speaker 0: Was it really DDR?

968
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:37,618
Speaker 1: No, it was like aerobics.

969
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,858
Speaker 1: There's a girl on a stage would, like, do dance moves, and you had to do the dance moves with her.

970
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:45,859
Speaker 0: And it was horrid.

971
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:47,179
Speaker 0: I imagine.

972
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:50,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, no wonder no one had that game.

973
00:49:50,646 --> 00:49:50,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

974
00:49:50,962 --> 00:49:52,440
Speaker 0: I bet if we found it, it could be hilarious.

975
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,539
Speaker 0: Hey, if we plug our ignition pads in the computer, can we play track and field on them?

976
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:57,819
Speaker 1: Oh, probably.

977
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,839
Speaker 1: Just have to bind the keys.

978
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,019
Speaker 0: Oh, cool.

979
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,717
Speaker 0: We should do it.

980
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:02,319
Speaker 1: There aren't enough.

981
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,560
Speaker 1: Remember, there's 12- 14 buttons on the power pad.

982
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:09,220
Speaker 0: Step off the pad for a long jump.

983
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,740
Speaker 1: The game knew, though, because if you stepped off the pad and didn't get back on, it would kill you.

984
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,640
Speaker 0: We had to get back on at the right time.

985
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:16,929
Speaker 1: Yep.

986
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are good days.

987
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,538
Speaker 1: Good days.

988
00:50:20,744 --> 00:50:21,279
Speaker 0: Good days.

989
00:50:24,008 --> 00:50:25,460
Speaker 1: Dude, we gotta play some double dribble still.

990
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,100
Speaker 0: We played a lot of, uh- Double dribble's, like, impossible to control.

991
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,760
Speaker 0: It's, like, back in the day it was great, but now not so good.

992
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,120
Speaker 1: Baseball games are still good.

993
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,180
Speaker 0: Baseball games are great because they're just swinging, throwing, and base running.

994
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,480
Speaker 1: Super baseball simulator is one of my favorite baseball games ever.

995
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,640
Speaker 0: Baseball simulator is great.

996
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,660
Speaker 0: We just need to set the right number of points for superpowers.

997
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,600
Speaker 1: Because we set too few, and then the game's just a normal baseball game.

998
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,340
Speaker 0: And we also have to give better controllers so we can have accurate base throwing.

999
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,619
Speaker 0: I don't know how many times- There's no way we don't steal all the bases.

1000
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:59,560
Speaker 1: The game was determined by any time someone got on base, it would just be the next five minutes of him slowly stealing bases until he eventually got to home.

1001
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,100
Speaker 0: And the only reason he got to home was because you couldn't control where you threw the ball accurately enough.

1002
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm running to third and you throw it to second.

1003
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:06,734
Speaker 0: What the hell?

1004
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:08,040
Speaker 0: It goes to first.

1005
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,075
Speaker 0: You know.

1006
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,380
Speaker 0: Oh, I throw to third.

1007
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:10,980
Speaker 0: No one's there.

1008
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,140
Speaker 0: It goes off to the side.

1009
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,280
Speaker 0: The only people who can get the ball now are the outfielders.

1010
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,557
Speaker 0: No one else can go get it.

1011
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,640
Speaker 0: Visually, bases loaded.

1012
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:21,020
Speaker 0: Bases loaded actually is the real deal.

1013
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:25,180
Speaker 0: It actually matters if you throw the ball higher or low, not just left and right.

1014
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:25,969
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1015
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:29,800
Speaker 0: So I remember playing bases loaded back in the day.

1016
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,399
Speaker 0: It was definitely my favorite NES baseball game.

1017
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:35,200
Speaker 0: Even though it didn't have the superpowers.

1018
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,598
Speaker 1: See, it wasn't until the Super Baseball Simulator for the Super Nintendo that I really got into baseball games.

1019
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:43,120
Speaker 0: I had bases loaded and then I never got another baseball game.

1020
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,660
Speaker 1: I used to play entire seasons of Baseball Simulator in the game.

1021
00:51:46,786 --> 00:51:47,038
Speaker 0: Wow.

1022
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:49,960
Speaker 0: I never actually finished the season of Baseball Simulator.

1023
00:51:51,227 --> 00:51:51,960
Speaker 0: Or bases loaded.

1024
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,680
Speaker 0: I just played against people all the time.

1025
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,080
Speaker 1: In fact, I even went in and I made my own teams from scratch.

1026
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,260
Speaker 0: If I remember correctly, I think Nintendo had owned the Seattle Mariners.

1027
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,318
Speaker 0: Maybe they still do or they have a hand in them.

1028
00:52:04,062 --> 00:52:08,712
Speaker 0: And then I remember because Griffey was on the Mariners and they made Ken Griffey Jr.

1029
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:09,920
Speaker 0: Baseball for the SNES.

1030
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,319
Speaker 0: And a lot of people say that that was one of the greatest baseball games there was ever.

1031
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,318
Speaker 0: And I should get the ROM for it because I never actually... I played a demo in a KB Toys once.

1032
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:22,872
Speaker 0: Oh, that's it.

1033
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:26,940
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's supposed to be like one of the great baseball games.

1034
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,638
Speaker 0: I never played it.

1035
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think I've ever played it either.

1036
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll try to find it.

1037
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:36,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we've exhausted most of the two-player games that we still have a desire to play.

1038
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:40,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think there are a few that we've left untouched.

1039
00:52:41,222 --> 00:52:42,999
Speaker 0: But maybe we want to keep them that way.

1040
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:46,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't want to spoil those memories.

1041
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,380
Speaker 1: You don't want to remind yourself how terrible the game actually was.

1042
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:56,000
Speaker 0: I think we've got NBA Jam, tournament edition, which I had with the Sega Genesis, and I was the master of it for the Sega Genesis.

1043
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,740
Speaker 1: Plus, I'm going to start busting out with the old single-player games.

1044
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,038
Speaker 1: I want to play DuckTales again.

1045
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,980
Speaker 0: Eh, what do I want to play?

1046
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,100
Speaker 0: I want to try... I'm going to keep trying to play Secret of Mana, but I need someone to help me do that.

1047
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,740
Speaker 1: Once you find the girl, I'll play the girl.

1048
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:09,310
Speaker 0: All right.

1049
00:53:10,282 --> 00:53:16,579
Speaker 0: And then I kind of want to play, you know, the Mario World, because I could play Mario World all day.

1050
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,900
Speaker 0: But I'm going to try to beat every single level in every single world.

1051
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,840
Speaker 1: I'm not that good at Mario World anymore.

1052
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:23,779
Speaker 0: I'm really good at Mario.

1053
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:24,600
Speaker 1: I lost all my skills.

1054
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,199
Speaker 0: I'm really good at Mario World still.

1055
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,259
Speaker 0: You know, no one can really touch me.

1056
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,159
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't beat everything perfectly, but I can just beat it.

1057
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,379
Speaker 1: The Forest was my second favorite place.

1058
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,519
Speaker 1: Favorite place was obviously Star World.

1059
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,539
Speaker 0: Oh no, the Vanilla Dome is where the action is.

1060
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,700
Speaker 0: Vanilla Dome and the Butter Bridge were the best places in the game.

1061
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,939
Speaker 0: And of course, all the Boo Houses.

1062
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for some of the ones in the end that you didn't want to go into.

1063
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,559
Speaker 0: No, those are the great.

1064
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,478
Speaker 0: Those are the best ones.

1065
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,720
Speaker 1: No, but trying to get the secret exit in those.

1066
00:53:51,941 --> 00:53:52,500
Speaker 0: That's fine.

1067
00:53:53,684 --> 00:53:54,859
Speaker 0: I loved all the Boo Houses.

1068
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,499
Speaker 0: Finding the secret exit was half the fun.

1069
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,838
Speaker 1: I think you have a Boo Fettie.

1070
00:53:58,641 --> 00:53:59,960
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with a Boo Fettie.

1071
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,859
Speaker 1: I mean, you sleep with a Boo Plushie.

1072
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:02,718
Speaker 0: That's fine.

1073
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,188
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1074
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,799
Speaker 0: I think you've got a Pillow Fettie.

1075
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:10,280
Speaker 1: Uh, yes, because I do indeed sleep on a pillow.

1076
00:54:10,762 --> 00:54:11,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, fair.

1077
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:22,890
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1078
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,489
