1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,318
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, November 14th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:10,619
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:14,230
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,497
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Knights.

5
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,750
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're reviewing Cobalt Core.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,548
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:32,710
Speaker 1: So, uh, you listen to Geek Knights, you know that when we were young, we dabbled in AMD because there was a time when an AMD CPU cost, like, a fifth of an Intel and was faster.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,046
Speaker 0: Well, it was basically, you know, the Pentium 3 came out.

9
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:36,810
Speaker 0: I had a Pentium 3.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,899
Speaker 0: That was the first computer I built, right?

11
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:42,531
Speaker 0: Not the first one I owned, but the first one I built was Pentium 3.

12
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:52,790
Speaker 0: And then, you know, when that became, when that was running its course and was ready for it to be replaced, you looked around at the world and there were Pentium 4s, which are very, very expensive, first of all.

13
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,290
Speaker 0: And not that fast.

14
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:59,910
Speaker 0: Uh, well, you know, there was lots of, you know, they were pretty fast, relatively speaking.

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:04,030
Speaker 0: But there was, basically, it's like, what were you getting for your money?

16
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,750
Speaker 0: It was not a good price performance ratio, right?

17
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:14,714
Speaker 0: And, meanwhile, AMD was out there with all these Athlon CPUs that were actually like, "Hey, they work.

18
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:18,568
Speaker 0: They're way cheaper in terms of the performance you

19
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:18,789
Speaker 0: get.".

20
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,229
Speaker 0: And pretty much everyone was all in on them.

21
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was right when, it was the case, because the K6s were, like, not quite there.

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,489
Speaker 1: The K7s were, that was like 800 megahertz, 900 megahertz, breaking the gigahertz barrier with that Thunderbird like a little while later.

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like, yeah, okay.

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,790
Speaker 0: And, you know, people were, you know, you could get the AMD video cards, but I didn't.

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,630
Speaker 0: I stuck with the Nvidia ones, but it's like the AMD CPUs.

26
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,069
Speaker 0: It's like everything worked just normally with them.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,069
Speaker 0: There wasn't, you know, so that's what we went with in those days.

28
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:59,990
Speaker 0: Until, like, you know, the mid-2000s-ish, when Intel, when Geeknight started, and they came out with, like, core duos, and they, you know, and that sort of thing.

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,830
Speaker 0: That's when we stopped using those.

30
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,869
Speaker 0: And the one thing is, like, yeah, did they work?

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,970
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, when they worked, they worked, right?

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,704
Speaker 0: But, it's like...

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:10,892
Speaker 1: Very telling.

34
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:19,149
Speaker 1: Every AMD thing I ever had didn't post successfully the first time I tried to turn it on, and then I had to fuss with it, and then it worked.

35
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,569
Speaker 1: Every Intel I've ever had posted the first time.

36
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:24,150
Speaker 1: Without exception.

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, but, in my experience, which is not data, we know, it's just anecdotes, right?

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:42,370
Speaker 0: There were reliability issues in the early 2000s, when I was using those AMDs, and the one AMD video card we did have lying around, for some strange reason, that we put in the earliest busted HCDC.

39
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,650
Speaker 1: We couldn't get the S-video out to work on Linux.

40
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was, it just, like, didn't work properly, right?

41
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,770
Speaker 0: But, you know, in the experience that I personally had, every time that I used Intel and NVIDIA things, they worked.

42
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:07,650
Speaker 0: You know, there might have been other issues around, you know, even my computers are not 100% perfect, there's always some tiny issue, but I have the least issues of anyone I know when it comes to computers and technology.

43
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,510
Speaker 1: I have to say, my current computer, which is pushing, like, this is a sixth generation Intel, and it's still basically perfect.

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:30,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so we've entered another era now, where people, nerds especially, are again going towards AMD, and their price-performance ratios, and even AMD video cards, right?

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,096
Speaker 0: And it's like, do they work?

46
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,130
Speaker 0: It's like, clearly, they work when they work, right?

47
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:48,125
Speaker 0: But, again, anecdotally, not based on data or benchmarks or any sort of anything like that, just anecdotally, the people I know who have AMD equipment have some issues.

48
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:49,570
Speaker 0: They have issues, right?

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:59,779
Speaker 1: So, some friends of ours, a friend of ours just got, like, a new AMD setup and talking to the other AMD people about, like, what to get, and there's a Discord thread that is very long.

50
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:17,410
Speaker 1: of all the fucking problems they had, like, trying to get it to work the way they wanted, that was very funny, and simultaneously, I haven't even been playing Overwatch the other day, and in the middle of the match, like, someone on my team just disconnects, like, fuck, we're gonna lose now, like, we're screwed.

51
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:31,320
Speaker 1: And, like, we lose the game because a player's out for a minute, but they came back, and they're like, sorry, my game crashed, and I'm just like, why do you have an AMD GPU?

52
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:35,030
Speaker 1: And this kid responds, like, how did you know I have an AMD?

53
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,948
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, it's a one out of two chance of guessing, right?

54
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,589
Speaker 0: It's already a 50/50 of guessing correctly.

55
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:59,089
Speaker 1: But I'd say it's a little better than 50/50 because my anecdotal, again, just pure anecdotes, everyone I know who has problems with Overwatch has an AMD, and when I Googled for it, found a bunch of Reddit threads that people have in trouble with AMD, didn't find anything about any GTX whatever video card.

56
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:14,470
Speaker 0: Right, well, I mean, it could be this conspiracy theory talk, right, but there's some truth to it, in that I know, for a fact, from things I've heard and seen, that game developers, game engine makers work closely with AMD and Nvidia.

57
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,911
Speaker 0: Oh, our

58
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:35,930
Speaker 1: own friends, when we were, you and I were accused of, like, talking from experience and not from industry perspective around our favoritism toward Nvidia, and one of our very, like, skilled game developer friends directly said, no, they're not wrong, we mostly focus on Nvidia, and Nvidia mostly doesn't have problems.

59
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:44,270
Speaker 0: Right, but I'm not talking about, like, game developers focusing on Nvidia, I'm talking about actual direct working with business relationships, right?

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,530
Speaker 0: I know for a fact the Nvidia driver contains lots of code.

61
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,369
Speaker 1: Lots of, if Call of Duty, do this.

62
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:58,610
Speaker 0: Exactly, it literally has code exactly like that, like, if the game that is being played is this, do this.

63
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,950
Speaker 0: Like, they work that closely with AAA game developers especially when there's issues to make sure that their shit works perfectly.

64
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,230
Speaker 0: I'm sure AMD also does that to some extent, but it could be, right, you know, and this is the conspiracy theory part.

65
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,047
Speaker 1: Well, they're not doing a great job of it if they are.

66
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:31,170
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure it could be, and this is conspiracy theory talk again, that Nvidia does that so well, right, to such an extent that it's, like, anti-competitive behavior to where sort of the fix is in, in that shit will work with them and not with AMD.

67
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:45,870
Speaker 0: Not because of hardware inferiority or anything like that, but simply out of just that's how it is, because you work so closely with me, we made sure our shit worked perfectly, and we didn't test it so much with their shit, and that's the problem.

68
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:53,130
Speaker 0: It's not actually something AMD did, it's just something there wasn't as many resources put into that.

69
00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:12,010
Speaker 1: Also, an aside, every game developer I know who does, like, coding and heavy work, regardless of, like, what the company does and, like, what relationships they have with the industry, their own gaming PCs, they religiously have Nvidia and Intel.

70
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:30,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing, it's like, you know, even if, you know, they're not working with Nvidia or targeting it or thinking about it, right, the vast majority of game makers' computers have Nvidia boards in them, right, you're not, they're not, and so the result of that is just going to be that sort of.

71
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:38,230
Speaker 0: naturally, that's what is going to be optimized for, right, because they're optimizing it for the computer that they're using.

72
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:45,025
Speaker 0: And so, it's like, if, you know, if that's the case, it's like, yeah, is AMD actually inferior?

73
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:57,170
Speaker 0: They're giving you that better price-performance ratio, but in terms of your real-world computing, gaming, it's like, you're going to pay more for the Nvidia, you're going to get the stability and the reliability.

74
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:22,050
Speaker 0: And now, if you're short on money or you enjoy messing with your broken computer or breaking your computer on purpose and breaking shit that, you know, it ain't broke, just because you like fixing it and then complaining even though you're the one who broke it or whatever, it's like, you know, you just like to look at numbers and your benchmarks and not actually use your computer to do anything, you just like playing with your computer for no purpose.

75
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny.

76
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:39,001
Speaker 0: Okay, go and get an AMD hardware, but if you're someone who is using your computer as a tool to accomplish tasks and to create things and to do things, you, the highest priority should be your computer works.

77
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:42,030
Speaker 0: You care if your benchmark number is bigger, right?

78
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,195
Speaker 0: I need a computer that is on.

79
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:51,310
Speaker 0: If it renders the video in 30 seconds and crashes at the 29th second, I'd rather have it render in two minutes and not crash.

80
00:08:52,170 --> 00:09:09,010
Speaker 0: So, if you got the money, even after all these years, you know, argue, provide data or whatever, but I'm still anti-AMD based on, you know, pure anecdotal data.

81
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:18,670
Speaker 1: I mean, my workstation, partly because losing an episode of "Gig Nights" that we've recorded is the worst fucking thing on earth.

82
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,145
Speaker 1: Like, that is, that, the few times it happened, that was like being punched right, right in the heart.

83
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:25,690
Speaker 1: It was, it was just awful.

84
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,315
Speaker 1: This computer is like eight years old that I'm making "Gig Nights" on.

85
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:39,490
Speaker 1: And when I made it, my only mission was to make it last as long as possible without having to ever open it or do anything to it at all.

86
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,539
Speaker 1: I wanted it to just work for as long as possible.

87
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,170
Speaker 1: And I put a lot of time and effort into building a computer that would just work.

88
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,037
Speaker 1: And here I am in the year 2023 with an i7-6700K, and it is still perfect other than Adobe Creative Cloud.

89
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,149
Speaker 0: Windows 11 doesn't support it.

90
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,933
Speaker 1: Windows 11 doesn't support it for no good reason.

91
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:10,710
Speaker 1: But also, I encountered my first bottleneck that mattered, that was the CPU, and it is a game you might have heard of called Adobe Lightroom.

92
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:16,550
Speaker 1: The new Lightroom cannot work appropriately.

93
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:29,549
Speaker 0: Lightroom is a little bit slow on my 8700K here, but I think what I'm going to do, I think I've decided, right, is they got the new MacBook M3, and I'm like, all right, this is what, you know, I was planning on computer next year, right?

94
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 0: But Apple came and they're like, aha, we're coming at you months early.

95
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,350
Speaker 0: And I'm like, why you do this, right?

96
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:43,370
Speaker 0: But I'm just going to buy, you know, the craziest one, obviously not the 16-inch one, the smaller one, right?

97
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:53,210
Speaker 0: But the fastest processor one, and not the most RAM they sell, because they really, and not the most storage, but, you know, enough, right?

98
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,990
Speaker 0: I'll pay for some ridiculously overpriced upgrades.

99
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:03,270
Speaker 1: I think I just saw an article on Waypo that argued that the way Apple charges for RAM might arguably be illegal.

100
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:04,492
Speaker 0: It should be.

101
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:05,654
Speaker 0: It really should be.

102
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:16,370
Speaker 0: It's really heinous because, like, seriously, you can buy like, you know, like 64 gigabytes of RAM on sticks for like, you know, hundreds.

103
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,340
Speaker 1: And even the argument of, oh, but it's ECC.

104
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,070
Speaker 1: ECC is not that much more expensive.

105
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,637
Speaker 0: I don't think it's, no, it's, I don't think it's ECC at all.

106
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:27,210
Speaker 0: I think what it, I don't think it is, but it is, it is integrated RAM.

107
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,502
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not, you know, replaceable, you know, it's the same stuff.

108
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,250
Speaker 0: It's just, it's, you know, it's like, it's right next to the chip.

109
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,654
Speaker 0: So it's not exactly identical.

110
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:39,845
Speaker 0: It does justify some markup, but not a 300% markup.

111
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,610
Speaker 0: And the storage is even more criminal.

112
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,250
Speaker 1: Apple stops using ECC with Intel processors that aren't Xeon, according to the internet.

113
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,877
Speaker 0: Yeah.

114
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,163
Speaker 0: Let me see.

115
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,508
Speaker 0: I think I wrote it down here.

116
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:57,633
Speaker 0: Okay.

117
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,296
Speaker 0: So yeah.

118
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:06,808
Speaker 0: You can buy a Samsung 990 Pro M2 SSD with four terabytes of storage for under $300, right?

119
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:17,250
Speaker 0: To upgrade, right, an M3 Mac, Macbook Pro that just came out, they default to one terabyte of storage.

120
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,504
Speaker 0: If you want to upgrade them two from one to four, so you're adding three terabytes, right?

121
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:25,950
Speaker 0: You're adding three, you're not buying four, you're adding three.

122
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,313
Speaker 0: They will charge you $1,000.

123
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:32,701
Speaker 0: So that's a 300% markup versus just buying M2 drives that are $300 each.

124
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely a criminal markup.

125
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:47,580
Speaker 0: But, you know, that is what it is.

126
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:55,870
Speaker 0: So what I'm going to attempt, and I guess I can always return it, but I think this will, I think this will work out because it's still, you know, we talk about Intel.

127
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,275
Speaker 0: It's like, I've used the Apple M chip at work.

128
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:02,639
Speaker 0: now for, you know, since the M2 Air came out.

129
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:10,870
Speaker 0: And it's like this little thin, tiny wafer thing here is by far the fastest computer in the house.

130
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,472
Speaker 0: And it's not even remotely close.

131
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,456
Speaker 0: It doesn't even have fans in it.

132
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:16,177
Speaker 0: Right.

133
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:25,850
Speaker 0: So it's like you basically, if you can justify it by saying, all right, the, the, the, the, the upcharge on the storage and the RAM.

134
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:33,002
Speaker 0: It's basically just sort of subsidized by the CPU, which is absolutely insane that they have over there.

135
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,810
Speaker 0: But what I'm going to do is I'm going to get that and use that for all my computing biz.

136
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:38,490
Speaker 0: Right.

137
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:42,720
Speaker 0: The iPad Pro I have, I think is going to not be supported in a year.

138
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,290
Speaker 0: And I'll just sort of let it fade and I won't replace it because I'll have a MacBook.

139
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:47,871
Speaker 0: Right.

140
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,054
Speaker 0: It's the same purpose.

141
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:54,446
Speaker 0: And then this computer that's five, six years old now, I'm not going to get rid of it.

142
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,270
Speaker 0: I'm going to use steam stream.

143
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:58,231
Speaker 0: Right.

144
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,759
Speaker 0: And just keep it over in the corner there with just power and network cable.

145
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,244
Speaker 0: And then, oh, look, I can play all the games still.

146
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:07,370
Speaker 0: There's nothing I can't do because I still have a Windows computer in the corner.

147
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,935
Speaker 0: I just don't actually need to, you know, use it directly.

148
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:22,390
Speaker 0: And if I ever reach a point where I want to play some games and they either don't run on Mac or don't run on this old Windows computer, then I'll get a new Windows computer.

149
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,435
Speaker 0: That's just basically a video card in a box.

150
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:25,976
Speaker 0: Right.

151
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,520
Speaker 0: And as small as possible, cram it in a corner.

152
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:31,826
Speaker 0: And again, use the steam stream situation.

153
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,170
Speaker 0: And I think this, this plan is going to work.

154
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,352
Speaker 0: And you know what?

155
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,177
Speaker 0: If the plan doesn't work, I can change.

156
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:40,100
Speaker 0: I could do a new plan in five years.

157
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,306
Speaker 0: I could always, even if I can't return the Mac, I wait too long.

158
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,169
Speaker 0: I'll be able to sell it, I think.

159
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,510
Speaker 0: Right.

160
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

161
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:50,135
Speaker 1: And if the plan works, like maybe I'll go down a similar road.

162
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:50,535
Speaker 1: We'll see.

163
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,933
Speaker 0: But it's literally my primary computer.

164
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,817
Speaker 0: It's not like the side, like you have a laptop, it's like a side laptop.

165
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:11,437
Speaker 0: But like before

166
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:24,410
Speaker 1: it repacks, I open that laptop and I like download a PDF of the panel and download the video of the pre-roll, like the open it, the walk-in stuff and like synchronize it and do some Windows updates because I really only use the thing at cons and work travel.

167
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,899
Speaker 0: It's like, no, this will be my main computer, the primary one that does all the things.

168
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:29,199
Speaker 0: Right.

169
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,985
Speaker 0: And this other Windows computer will have steam on it.

170
00:15:32,526 --> 00:15:34,730
Speaker 0: And that's it pretty much mostly.

171
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:45,770
Speaker 1: So anyway, in some news, when Scott sent me a link to this and we didn't talk about it because we skipped shows for a while, all he said was, this is a very geek night story.

172
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,181
Speaker 0: There's a lot of geek night stories.

173
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:48,149
Speaker 0: I say that a lot.

174
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,711
Speaker 0: You do.

175
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:55,550
Speaker 1: But this one is like hyper geek nights and crosses almost every intersection of everything we talk about in games.

176
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,088
Speaker 0: We got a few of those tonight.

177
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:57,670
Speaker 1: Yep.

178
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:09,404
Speaker 1: So this article on patch is titled pickleball brawl players hash out gripes anti-Semitism on Upper East Side courts.

179
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:14,710
Speaker 1: And what this boils down to, to summarize, you're not aware there's a sport called pickleball.

180
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,836
Speaker 1: Now, you might think it's new, but it's not.

181
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,439
Speaker 1: This is a sport from the 70s.

182
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:24,710
Speaker 1: It has come and gone in waves of fad.

183
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,290
Speaker 1: Like right now, like in the late 80s and early 90s, pickleball was huge and then it disappeared and now it's back.

184
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:33,600
Speaker 1: So it comes and goes in waves.

185
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,544
Speaker 1: It's not new.

186
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,770
Speaker 1: It's been around for a long time.

187
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:48,990
Speaker 1: And if I had to describe it, if you don't know what pickleball is, it's basically tennis, but it removes most of the requirements for athleticism and focuses more like it's a different kind.

188
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,190
Speaker 1: It's the same kind of game, but like you don't have to be super fit to be really good.

189
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,730
Speaker 0: It's basically in between ping pong and tennis, but slower.

190
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,790
Speaker 1: I'd argue ping pong requires way more physical skill.

191
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,880
Speaker 0: I'm talking about size.

192
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:02,810
Speaker 0: Size wise.

193
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:03,925
Speaker 1: Size wise.

194
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:04,050
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,349
Speaker 0: It's smaller than a tennis court, but bigger than a ping pong.

196
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:15,250
Speaker 1: Well, it was originally designed to be playable on like a tennis court, but you play like just in part of the tennis court.

197
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,011
Speaker 0: Yeah.

198
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:19,386
Speaker 0: It's a little bit sort of like playing wiffle ball, but like wiffle tennis, right?

199
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,270
Speaker 0: Because it's slower.

200
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,569
Speaker 1: When I was in middle school and high school, it was the kind of game that like gym classes would just make all the kids play and nobody liked it.

201
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:27,330
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:35,010
Speaker 0: But I mean, it's, you know, on the one hand, I'm not going to say like, oh, it's, it's as, you know, I guess good by whatever measure.

203
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,311
Speaker 0: Right.

204
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:45,010
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, this isn't like if you're the champion of pickleball, that's not like a great accomplishment because be, you know, being really good at that is not as hard as being good.

205
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,950
Speaker 1: It's like the difference between being really good at a console FPS versus being really good at Counter Strike.

206
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:50,913
Speaker 0: Right.

207
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,550
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's, it's not as difficult.

208
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:06,190
Speaker 0: But as a sport for people to play recreationally, it's, it's great that this exists because it gives people who aren't, you know, it's like, would you rather have all the old people sitting around, you know, tennis is too hard for the old people.

209
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,611
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:09,490
Speaker 0: It's like better they play pickleball than nothing.

211
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:09,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

212
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:10,111
Speaker 0: Right.

213
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:16,186
Speaker 1: And I get it to be clear, like, I don't want to imply that I think pickleball is bad in any way in anything we're about to talk about.

214
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,950
Speaker 1: Pickleball is fine.

215
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,013
Speaker 1: It's a game.

216
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:20,135
Speaker 1: It's a sport.

217
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,078
Speaker 1: Go nuts.

218
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:22,902
Speaker 1: Nothing wrong with pickleball.

219
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,070
Speaker 0: However, just so you know what it is, it's it's easy tennis.

220
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,597
Speaker 0: And I also I do not that I would be any good at it.

221
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:29,818
Speaker 0: Right.

222
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:31,924
Speaker 0: I don't want someone to come and say, oh, you said it's easy.

223
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:32,847
Speaker 0: Well, let's see you play.

224
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:34,050
Speaker 0: It's like, no, I'm terrible.

225
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,912
Speaker 0: I'm so bad.

226
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:37,494
Speaker 0: I can't do ping pong tennis.

227
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:39,177
Speaker 0: Maybe I could do bad.

228
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:44,686
Speaker 1: And if the other person is, it's partly funny that the people who are really into it right now are acting like it is like they keep.

229
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:45,587
Speaker 1: all the stories are.

230
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,370
Speaker 1: it's the fastest growing sport in America.

231
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,101
Speaker 1: And while that is it is technically true, it has been the fastest growing sport in America at multiple points in the past.

232
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:53,983
Speaker 1: And then it disappeared.

233
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:55,927
Speaker 0: So it's been.

234
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:56,427
Speaker 0: I think it's.

235
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,690
Speaker 0: it's got some staying power.

236
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,732
Speaker 0: It does.

237
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:07,849
Speaker 1: But any game that gets popular, that is competitive, runs into every problem we have talked about on gig nights for the last 18 years.

238
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,518
Speaker 1: So now there is big drama around pickleball like I couldn't even.

239
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:23,110
Speaker 0: Well, the fundamental problem is that unlike other sports, right, tennis ish sports and pickleball also require space.

240
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:28,500
Speaker 0: And it's a lot of space for a very small number of players at a time.

241
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:28,740
Speaker 0: Right.

242
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:29,862
Speaker 0: A whole tennis court.

243
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,768
Speaker 0: You can have just like two people, maybe four, maybe four.

244
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:33,870
Speaker 0: And that's it.

245
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,190
Speaker 0: Right.

246
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,958
Speaker 0: It's like that same space could have a basketball court with 10 people playing.

247
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,379
Speaker 0: Yeah.

248
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:39,820
Speaker 0: Right.

249
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,006
Speaker 0: That same space could have like a mini soccer field.

250
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:44,727
Speaker 0: Right.

251
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,290
Speaker 0: With with a lot of people playing.

252
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,094
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, the other the far extreme of that is golf.

253
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,198
Speaker 0: Yes, golf.

254
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:57,669
Speaker 0: But but the thing is, even though one golf hole could have like, you know, can still have maybe eight people.

255
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:58,230
Speaker 0: Right.

256
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

257
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:04,180
Speaker 1: But count the number of acres versus the number of humans actively playing the game at one time.

258
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:07,445
Speaker 0: Right now, in New York City, space is at a premium.

259
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,170
Speaker 0: It's not like the suburbs where you can play pickleball, no problem.

260
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,059
Speaker 0: So with the result of that, the suburbs, you can't play pickleball, no problem anymore.

261
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,282
Speaker 1: I found a bunch of other articles.

262
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:19,790
Speaker 1: There's big drama in the suburbs, too, because depends on how crowded the sub.

263
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,194
Speaker 1: Well, most suburbs have like.

264
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:31,530
Speaker 1: there's tennis courts around like if you live in suburban America, there are just random tennis courts like at high schools, in apartment complexes, like next to them in parks.

265
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,473
Speaker 1: And they're very usually just free and can just play on them.

266
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,316
Speaker 1: And it's not really a big deal.

267
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:48,090
Speaker 1: But the drama in most of these suburbs over the last year is that the tennis courts that were moderately used, but like weren't a crunch are suddenly completely filled with pickleball people.

268
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,776
Speaker 1: So one, the tennis players can't play tennis because people are playing pickleball pickleball on the tennis courts.

269
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,520
Speaker 1: And two, the pickleball people, there's way more of them.

270
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,526
Speaker 1: And they're all mad because no one's organizing the line or enforcing the rules.

271
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,330
Speaker 1: they're making up over how long anyone gets to play in this free place.

272
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:05,172
Speaker 0: Yeah.

273
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,935
Speaker 0: Well, so that's the thing in New York City.

274
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:07,356
Speaker 0: Right.

275
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:14,690
Speaker 0: When we have a space constraint, they devised a system of permits for tennis, tennis permit in New York City.

276
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:25,430
Speaker 0: If you want to play any minutes or you have a membership at the Racquet Club, but you're there by a private tennis court or you pay a hundred bucks to get like you want to play tennis on a public tennis court.

277
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,094
Speaker 0: You need a permit in a New York City park.

278
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:28,595
Speaker 0: Right.

279
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:31,199
Speaker 0: And there's a reason that they had that system of permits.

280
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,630
Speaker 0: And, you know, people watching the courts was because that sport has a lot of space dedicated to a few people.

281
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:44,210
Speaker 0: And when demand exceeds the acreage available, they need to do some rationing.

282
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:50,650
Speaker 1: It's the same problem that is solved in arcades by people putting quarters on the rim of the DDR machine.

283
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:51,891
Speaker 0: Exactly.

284
00:21:51,971 --> 00:22:03,690
Speaker 0: So here we have a situation, though, with pickleball is somebody set up some pickleball courts right in a public place and basically with their own private equipment.

285
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,350
Speaker 0: Nonetheless, they're just letting the public use it just out of the generousness of their own heart.

286
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,159
Speaker 0: This guy comes every day, sets up the nets.

287
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:11,801
Speaker 0: Right.

288
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:14,310
Speaker 0: And at the end of the day, he takes them home and he lets everyone play.

289
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:16,478
Speaker 0: But there is no.

290
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:19,690
Speaker 0: this is not official in any way, shape or form.

291
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:20,373
Speaker 0: Right.

292
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:22,202
Speaker 0: There is no permitting system.

293
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:23,650
Speaker 0: It's on public land.

294
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:28,770
Speaker 0: And it's like no one really has a problem with the land being used that way.

295
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,171
Speaker 0: Right.

296
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:30,475
Speaker 0: You know, it's a public park.

297
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:35,070
Speaker 0: Most people want to play pickleball versus the other things that were being done in that park.

298
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,530
Speaker 1: But the pickleball people are fighting with the other pickleball people over how pickleball is going to go down.

299
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:40,535
Speaker 0: Exactly.

300
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:42,243
Speaker 0: There's no official system.

301
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:43,630
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a public park.

302
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,154
Speaker 0: Everyone has a right to be there.

303
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:50,050
Speaker 0: But you have spaces that are only limited to a few people at a time.

304
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:54,210
Speaker 0: And there's no official rationing system or anything in place whatsoever.

305
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,653
Speaker 1: Arcades have the same problem.

306
00:22:55,693 --> 00:23:00,990
Speaker 1: Like that system in quotes where people would put their token on the DDR machine to take their turn.

307
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,621
Speaker 1: No cop is enforcing that.

308
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,410
Speaker 1: Like you could just go up and play.

309
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,775
Speaker 1: And unless sometimes.

310
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:07,196
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:10,950
Speaker 0: But sometimes people just ignore that system and fights in the arcade.

312
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:11,771
Speaker 1: Exactly.

313
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:19,630
Speaker 1: Because the same reason why if a convention, you know, a nerd con says you can't line up for the autograph thing until four hours before.

314
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:20,894
Speaker 1: Then what happens?

315
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,041
Speaker 1: A bunch of people don't line up.

316
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,670
Speaker 1: They form a mob where the line is going to happen.

317
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,111
Speaker 0: Right.

318
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:32,910
Speaker 0: If you're playing Street Fighter in the arcade and there's a general rule of loser walks, that's the socially accepted rule.

319
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,475
Speaker 0: But it's not an enforced rule.

320
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,910
Speaker 0: If I lose and I just put a quarter in and keep playing, what are you going to punch me?

321
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,731
Speaker 0: Right.

322
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,059
Speaker 0: You'll be the one to go to jail.

323
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:41,844
Speaker 0: You can't stop me.

324
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:42,769
Speaker 0: You got to call the cops.

325
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,853
Speaker 1: Cops don't give a shit.

326
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,941
Speaker 1: Nor have you broken any law or rule.

327
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:46,784
Speaker 0: Right.

328
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:48,370
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the owner of the arcade going to do?

329
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,053
Speaker 0: They don't give a fuck.

330
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,017
Speaker 0: I put my quarter in.

331
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:50,740
Speaker 0: It's my play.

332
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:51,102
Speaker 0: Yeah.

333
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:51,302
Speaker 0: Right.

334
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,126
Speaker 0: I'm standing here.

335
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:52,930
Speaker 0: You can't move me.

336
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:53,551
Speaker 0: Right.

337
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:57,203
Speaker 0: It's like I wouldn't recommend behaving in the way I just described.

338
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:59,470
Speaker 0: I would recommend following the social convention.

339
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,334
Speaker 0: But that's a thing.

340
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:01,595
Speaker 0: Right.

341
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:07,910
Speaker 0: It's not a real rule the way that, yeah, if you don't have the tennis permit in New York City, yeah, the police will come.

342
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:08,891
Speaker 0: Right.

343
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:10,916
Speaker 0: And make you stop playing tennis eventually.

344
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:11,277
Speaker 0: Right.

345
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:16,270
Speaker 1: So arcade people can sort out the DDR machine, but the pickleball people don't seem to be able to sort out pickleball.

346
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:17,271
Speaker 0: No.

347
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,154
Speaker 0: And it's even worse.

348
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:24,510
Speaker 0: Not only are they fighting over who plays, but there is the same thing we've talked about in Competitive vs Casual.

349
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:25,112
Speaker 0: Right.

350
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:30,866
Speaker 0: Where some of the pickleball players are for serious and some of them are just like, not serious at all.

351
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,873
Speaker 1: Because it's so perfect.

352
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:40,190
Speaker 1: Quote, this debate has led to a number of flash points over the summer, including players refusing to leave courts when their time was up.

353
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,023
Speaker 1: And a scene where Albert removed other nets during the game to set up his own for his boring routine.

354
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:48,830
Speaker 1: Like he interrupted someone's game because he was doing his own thing.

355
00:24:49,571 --> 00:25:06,050
Speaker 1: But the thing that people seem to be the most mad about, other than the space and the time, is, quote, people are mad that sometimes there are hour long waits to play games that aren't worth it if they happen to get paired with less skilled players.

356
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:15,490
Speaker 1: And the skilled players are arguing they should be entitled to a special skilled court time for high skill only people so they don't have to play with the noobs.

357
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:19,850
Speaker 1: Why do you think there's matchmaking in every fucking video game?

358
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:20,790
Speaker 0: Right.

359
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:32,710
Speaker 0: So my suggestion there is if you are really that skilled, and pickleball is such an important part of your life, and you want to play a lot of pickleball, and you value it that much.

360
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:35,290
Speaker 1: Join a pickleball club, join a team, join a league.

361
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,795
Speaker 0: And you care about it that much, and you really are that good.

362
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:49,430
Speaker 0: Pay to join the racquet club with money, and you can play pickleball all fucking day nonstop against other people who are also caring about it so much that they are paying money as well.

363
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, the YMCA has a free ladder for every racquet sport you can imagine.

364
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,090
Speaker 0: Right.

365
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:55,814
Speaker 0: Join the racquet club.

366
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:56,897
Speaker 0: There are lots of them.

367
00:25:56,957 --> 00:26:00,967
Speaker 0: There are lots of racquet clubs all around the city for every weird ass sport.

368
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,197
Speaker 0: You can play squash, you can play racquetball, you can play pickleball, you can play tennis.

369
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:12,505
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can play high life, but basically everything with balls and nets and walls.

370
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:15,710
Speaker 0: Volleyball, water volleyball, it's like fucking everything.

371
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,812
Speaker 0: But it also leads to something else.

372
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:21,599
Speaker 1: This matchmaking system that they are complaining about is also not official or anything.

373
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:29,350
Speaker 1: Like when I was a kid, you wanted to play tennis, you didn't just go to a tennis court and assume someone would randomly be assigned to play with you.

374
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:32,929
Speaker 1: You went with someone and you two were going to play tennis against each other.

375
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:34,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

376
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:42,150
Speaker 0: So what's happening here is that people are showing up to this public park knowing that this is a big pickleball community and they're showing up alone.

377
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,151
Speaker 0: Right.

378
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:45,956
Speaker 0: And like, you know, a team will leave a game.

379
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:46,938
Speaker 0: Right.

380
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:51,245
Speaker 0: And then you'll come in with like whoever else got there and has been waiting the longest.

381
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:51,746
Speaker 0: Right.

382
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:52,868
Speaker 0: Is who you're going to be with.

383
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:53,148
Speaker 0: Right.

384
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:53,990
Speaker 0: You're not just, you know.

385
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,514
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's like I'll show up in the morning early.

386
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:58,656
Speaker 0: I'll be in line.

387
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:00,899
Speaker 0: And then when my friends get there, I'm like, you can't.

388
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:01,920
Speaker 0: It doesn't work that way.

389
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,360
Speaker 0: Right.

390
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:09,390
Speaker 1: So and now the casual players are accusing the people who care about the game more of being basically Nazis.

391
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:14,823
Speaker 1: And then the people who are better at the game are accusing the less skilled players of hogging court time.

392
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,229
Speaker 0: A bunch of adults acting like children.

393
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:17,810
Speaker 0: What else is new?

394
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,238
Speaker 1: So if pickleball continues to be popular, it isn't just the fourth wave of it becoming a fad and coming and going.

395
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,782
Speaker 1: I feel like New York City is going to say, all right, y'all fucked up.

396
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:30,284
Speaker 1: It's 100 bucks a year.

397
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:33,808
Speaker 1: There's going to be municipal pickleball courts and we're going to regulate it like we do tennis.

398
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:35,670
Speaker 1: The tennis people don't get into fistfights.

399
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,492
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this is why there's matchmaking in competitive FPS.

400
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:43,574
Speaker 1: So what's your news?

401
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:44,474
Speaker 1: This Pokemon thing?

402
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:46,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

403
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,298
Speaker 0: So another very geek night story.

404
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,039
Speaker 0: So there were some Pokemon championships.

405
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,400
Speaker 0: We're talking about the video game here.

406
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,021
Speaker 0: Right.

407
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:55,423
Speaker 0: And it is basically, you know, we know Pokemon.

408
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,103
Speaker 0: You're listening to this.

409
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,605
Speaker 0: You know, Pokemon is two components to being good at Pokemon.

410
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:04,869
Speaker 0: Number one is you have to put together a team of six Pokemon that are trained.

411
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,590
Speaker 0: Right.

412
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,052
Speaker 0: And have very high stats.

413
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:07,593
Speaker 0: Right.

414
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,474
Speaker 0: And how do you do that?

415
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:08,975
Speaker 0: Grinding.

416
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:14,542
Speaker 0: That's how you get IVs and EVs and ruining your life, feeding them the right foods, breeding them.

417
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:15,083
Speaker 0: Right.

418
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:20,170
Speaker 0: You just spent hours and hours and hours training the Pokemon to get them to be the strongest.

419
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:28,117
Speaker 0: And once you've done that, it's like now you have a chance to enter the second part of Pokemon, which is the actual battle.

420
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:32,741
Speaker 0: Choose which Pokemon you're going to send out first and choose which move you're going to use.

421
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:37,325
Speaker 0: And a sort of rock, paper, scissor battle that also involves Pokemon knowledge.

422
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:40,788
Speaker 0: And it's actually kind of an OK ish kind of game.

423
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:41,228
Speaker 0: Right.

424
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,009
Speaker 1: I like Pokemon battle as a concept.

425
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:43,630
Speaker 0: Right.

426
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,455
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, Pokemon battle is not so bad a game, really.

427
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:50,279
Speaker 0: It's not too far off from like, you know, competitive game.

428
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,163
Speaker 1: But IV and IV training is just poison for the soul.

429
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:58,169
Speaker 0: Training is a competition that tests who invested the most time.

430
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:58,610
Speaker 0: Right.

431
00:28:59,051 --> 00:28:59,952
Speaker 0: So what?

432
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:12,688
Speaker 0: So if you are to hold a Pokemon competition and you are to say that people must legitimately train all their Pokemon, what you're saying is that nobody has a chance of winning this competition.

433
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,249
Speaker 0: You could enter.

434
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:13,790
Speaker 0: Go right ahead.

435
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:21,800
Speaker 0: But you can only have a chance of winning if you have already spent X hours of your life training the Pokemon.

436
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:22,301
Speaker 0: Right.

437
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:26,326
Speaker 0: If you are not willing to sacrifice that many hours of your life, you can enter.

438
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:29,130
Speaker 0: But you can't win this thing unless you have insane luck.

439
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:40,250
Speaker 1: If you couldn't play tennis against anyone or pickleball, unless you stood in your house for 40 hours a week for a year, just bouncing the ball on your racket and then you play tennis.

440
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:40,810
Speaker 0: Yeah.

441
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,456
Speaker 0: The hours you spend on, you know, I think in competitions in general.

442
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:46,037
Speaker 0: Right.

443
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:49,501
Speaker 0: If you're talking about a fair competition where there are prizes at stake.

444
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:56,590
Speaker 0: where this is actually meaningful, nobody should get an advantage that is directly linked to time invested.

445
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:56,931
Speaker 0: Right.

446
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:01,718
Speaker 0: We don't give veteran sports athletes like free points when the game starts.

447
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:02,059
Speaker 0: Right.

448
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,401
Speaker 0: We don't let them use.

449
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:06,647
Speaker 1: Old gummy Joe has been playing hockey for 40 years.

450
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:08,610
Speaker 1: His team gets an extra point when the game starts.

451
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

452
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,512
Speaker 0: It's like we don't do that.

453
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:10,712
Speaker 0: Right.

454
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:14,378
Speaker 0: We don't let old gummy Joe use us an illegal stick.

455
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,203
Speaker 0: You know, we don't let him have upgraded equipments.

456
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:17,784
Speaker 0: Right.

457
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:21,450
Speaker 0: If we actually if there's prizes on the line, then it should be a fair competition.

458
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:27,139
Speaker 0: And the only thing that should matter are people's skills and not just time invested.

459
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:29,824
Speaker 0: So everyone knows open secret.

460
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:33,710
Speaker 0: 90 plus percent of Pokemon competitive players cheat.

461
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:40,820
Speaker 0: They use software to craft and create the ideal Pokemon, their ideal Pokemon team.

462
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:47,130
Speaker 0: There might not be an ideal Pokemon team, but their ideal team so they don't have to grind and sacrifice hours of their life.

463
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:55,350
Speaker 0: They could instead spend the time in their life practicing the battle part, the actual game part, and be better at that, the actual skill game.

464
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,774
Speaker 1: I'll say right now, pure direct value judgment.

465
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:00,116
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

466
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,479
Speaker 1: I think that's fine.

467
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,290
Speaker 1: If the Pokemon you bring to the Pokemon tournament is legitimately possible without cheating at the Pokemon game.

468
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:14,378
Speaker 1: Like you can't bring an unknown with infinite stats like that.

469
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:20,330
Speaker 0: They're not making these people are not making Pokemon that could not have been trained.

470
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,877
Speaker 0: They're not like, haha, I've got a Pikachu that has all a thousand stats.

471
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:32,350
Speaker 0: It's like, no, it has the max stats a Pikachu could have if you spent a whole year training it to perfect.

472
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:37,390
Speaker 1: And you got lucky and got the right Pikachu with the right like hidden stats and whatevers.

473
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,973
Speaker 0: Yes, it's possible.

474
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:40,834
Speaker 0: It's illegal.

475
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:43,579
Speaker 0: If you had trained it, it would be legal, right?

476
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:50,370
Speaker 0: There's nothing breaking the rules of the game about it other than they've arbitrarily decided that you have to actually legitimately.

477
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:57,770
Speaker 1: I think the people who get mad about this are the same people who get mad if someone else in an MMO bought gold or levels instead of grinded them.

478
00:31:58,171 --> 00:31:59,635
Speaker 0: Well, I think that what's happening here.

479
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:05,770
Speaker 0: Well, I think, you know, well, people who don't have I'm going to make a value judgment and I can make a human judgment.

480
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,236
Speaker 0: Those people are people who don't have a lot of skill, right?

481
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,661
Speaker 1: I'd also make that same value judge.

482
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:15,870
Speaker 0: They don't value being, you know, they don't value themselves being good at something.

483
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:25,461
Speaker 0: And when they play a game like, say, a JRPG, those games make those people feel good because anyone, regardless of skills, can invest time.

484
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,883
Speaker 0: Everyone has time, right?

485
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:32,950
Speaker 0: Even the worst, most disgusting person, the saddest person and the best person all have time.

486
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,232
Speaker 0: The same amount of it, right?

487
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:34,893
Speaker 0: Relatively.

488
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:45,270
Speaker 0: So anyone can invest time and a game that rewards you simply for investing time makes you feel like a winner regardless of whether you're actually good or bad.

489
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,290
Speaker 1: We've done so many panels on this, the difference between training versus playing or time versus effort.

490
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,130
Speaker 0: Right.

491
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:04,110
Speaker 0: And so those people who are feeling like a winner because of time investment and they see somebody else winning more or beating them who hasn't done time investment, but is maybe just actually good at a thing.

492
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:05,412
Speaker 0: They don't like that.

493
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:05,692
Speaker 0: Right.

494
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:08,116
Speaker 0: Because now they're illusion that they're a winner.

495
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:12,123
Speaker 0: That has been the lie that they're holding in front of themselves is now vanished.

496
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:12,764
Speaker 0: Right.

497
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:15,047
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, I'm not actually good at a thing.

498
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,790
Speaker 0: I just invested a lot of time.

499
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:22,550
Speaker 0: And it's like they need to make the thing that's making the lie vanish go away to keep the illusion in place.

500
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,375
Speaker 0: And so, right.

501
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:30,325
Speaker 0: Like I said, almost all the Pokemon players, I think the players basically agree with us.

502
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,407
Speaker 0: They're okay.

503
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:32,630
Speaker 0: The players don't care.

504
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:39,940
Speaker 0: They're okay with people just cheating to get the Pokemon as long as they're not cheating Pokemon.

505
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,261
Speaker 0: Right.

506
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,324
Speaker 0: They're just didn't spend their life grinding.

507
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:46,710
Speaker 0: But Nintendo operating the tournaments is not okay with that.

508
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:57,242
Speaker 0: So a few people got caught, I guess, somehow having their Pokemon were not legitimately grinded and trained by hand slowly and methodically.

509
00:33:57,843 --> 00:34:03,609
Speaker 0: And so those people got disqualified, even though the vast majority of players also, I guess you should just qualify 90% of the field.

510
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:04,871
Speaker 0: I don't know.

511
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:14,469
Speaker 1: But there's no way that many human beings grinded the amount of hours it would take to get the lucky special Dragonite.

512
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,409
Speaker 0: Yeah.

513
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:16,713
Speaker 0: With the perfect stats.

514
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:17,313
Speaker 0: Right.

515
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:18,155
Speaker 0: And then you had to do that.

516
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:22,443
Speaker 0: Not you get to do that for six Pokemon, not just for one six whole team.

517
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,789
Speaker 0: You don't want to walk in with like five perfect Pokemon in one week.

518
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,489
Speaker 0: One right.

519
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:29,272
Speaker 0: They got to all have the best possible set.

520
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:39,800
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's a real shame because I think that, you know, if Nintendo would just let you or in fact make a legitimate way to do this for competitive purposes.

521
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:40,501
Speaker 0: Right.

522
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,402
Speaker 0: I think it would actually, I don't think that Pokemon needs boosting.

523
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,904
Speaker 1: I think it would make the Pokemon competitive scene better.

524
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:48,627
Speaker 0: Pokemon's already the most popular, most money making intellectual property of all time.

525
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:52,350
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I think it would just make the scene better and remove this source of drama.

526
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:54,031
Speaker 0: Yep.

527
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,013
Speaker 0: But they're not doing that.

528
00:34:55,074 --> 00:35:01,908
Speaker 0: So for the time being, it's like you either have to grind, hope you don't get caught or don't play competitive Pokemon.

529
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:02,770
Speaker 0: Those are your three choices.

530
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:09,781
Speaker 1: My advice to you, hack and just don't get caught because you're not cheating in my perspective and I doubt you'll get caught.

531
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,567
Speaker 0: Only a few people got caught when almost everyone was cheating.

532
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,149
Speaker 0: So go ahead.

533
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,854
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

534
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:26,758
Speaker 1: So this is partly an example.

535
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,221
Speaker 1: This isn't going to fool anyone.

536
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,944
Speaker 1: It's obviously an AI generated content.

537
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:33,326
Speaker 1: It's labeled as such.

538
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,387
Speaker 1: It's intended to be such.

539
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,810
Speaker 1: It's basically just a demonstration.

540
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,152
Speaker 0: It was before I even saw the label.

541
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,274
Speaker 0: Yep, absolutely.

542
00:35:40,654 --> 00:35:43,477
Speaker 1: But the title YouTube title video is called AI.

543
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:55,710
Speaker 1: Tom Scott talks about Sneed and basically someone wrote, uh, if you don't know Tom Scott, he's one of those popular YouTubers, but unlike a lot of them, he's acting like his content is pretty good and he doesn't seem like he's a bad person.

544
00:35:56,451 --> 00:36:07,805
Speaker 0: As far as I could tell, I didn't even know what his name was, but it's just like, oh, that's that guy who always appears on YouTube, but looks like he's on like, you know, one of those TV cable channels.

545
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:08,285
Speaker 0: Right.

546
00:36:08,706 --> 00:36:12,190
Speaker 0: It's like he does like a National Geographic kind of production.

547
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,051
Speaker 0: Good content.

548
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:18,157
Speaker 1: It's, it's a little bit of mix of like teaching you something plus some investigative journalism.

549
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:29,810
Speaker 0: Like there's like, it looks like someone's doing a report for like, you know, the BBC or something, but it's just this guy who's on YouTube, but he has a very particular style for one.

550
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:39,256
Speaker 1: And two, he has made so many hours of content that training an AI model to mimic his voice is basically a trivial exercise.

551
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:46,521
Speaker 1: So someone, this YouTube channel just train, had an AI model that will mimic his voice, wrote a script.

552
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:58,970
Speaker 1: that is exactly the kind of thing he would talk about, about a made up thing, which happens to be one of the least noticed jokes in the first 11 years of The Simpsons, Sneed's Feed and Seed.

553
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:06,197
Speaker 1: And it sounds exactly like Tom Scott to my ears.

554
00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:07,399
Speaker 1: Like, I know it's fake.

555
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,583
Speaker 1: I know it's not him, but it's basically perfect.

556
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:12,326
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

557
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:15,450
Speaker 1: Oh, you've got the best possible Pax Omegathon ever.

558
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:16,991
Speaker 0: Yeah.

559
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:21,454
Speaker 0: So I'm sure most people here know about Rock'em Sock'em robots, which is a toy.

560
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:22,755
Speaker 0: It's also a game.

561
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,838
Speaker 0: It's a plastic toy with a little plastic boxing ring.

562
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:29,581
Speaker 0: And both players have basically two little joysticks with buttons on them.

563
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:35,787
Speaker 0: And you can use them to move your road as a plastic robot, like physical plastic robot attached to them.

564
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:39,770
Speaker 0: And you can move the robot a little bit and you push the buttons to punch.

565
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,396
Speaker 0: And you're trying to punch the other robot in the head and not get punched in, you're not get your robot punched in the head.

566
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:49,360
Speaker 0: And so as soon as their head pops up out of their body, that's a win.

567
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,303
Speaker 0: And you can play to however many points you want.

568
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:56,028
Speaker 0: It's basically like Street Fighter, but physical in the real world, but no people have to get hurt.

569
00:37:56,628 --> 00:37:57,990
Speaker 0: Sort of like BattleBots, really.

570
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,551
Speaker 1: But also it doesn't actually work that well.

571
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,452
Speaker 0: Like no motors.

572
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:01,952
Speaker 0: Yeah.

573
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:04,154
Speaker 1: Like Rock'em Sock'em robots kind of doesn't work.

574
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:05,815
Speaker 1: And I remember we want to, it's

575
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:24,888
Speaker 0: a really cheap, you could make a nice one that worked and was fair, but they're so imprecisely manufactured and poorly manufactured that who wins and loses often ends up being to just like, Oh yeah, this particular Rock'em Sock'em robots, like the mechanism reds head is a little loose and pops up kind of easy and blues is really stiff.

576
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:27,370
Speaker 0: So you're going to win most of the time.

577
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:34,179
Speaker 1: The head of the Omegathon finale at PAX did an AMA and you asked him, what about Rock'em Sock'em robots?

578
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,584
Speaker 1: And he literally was like, look, yeah, we thought it was a good idea too.

579
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:40,869
Speaker 1: We tried, we tested, it doesn't fucking work.

580
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,850
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

581
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,432
Speaker 0: It is terrible.

582
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:46,074
Speaker 0: So what if you could make something like that?

583
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:46,915
Speaker 0: Not terrible.

584
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:49,118
Speaker 0: It's basically puppet fight, right?

585
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:59,368
Speaker 0: Like I've got a marionette, you got a marionette and you know, they both have, you know, they punch and kick each other and there's some mechanism for determining which marionette wins.

586
00:38:59,448 --> 00:38:59,588
Speaker 0: Right.

587
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:00,890
Speaker 0: That's basically what it is.

588
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:01,150
Speaker 0: Right.

589
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,915
Speaker 0: And that's actually kind of cool because it's real.

590
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:12,350
Speaker 0: Like I said, it's Street Fighter, only the controls are, you know, marionette controls as opposed to, you know, a game pad or a joystick.

591
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:19,840
Speaker 0: Here we have some genius people who have made a certain kind of puppet.

592
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:26,930
Speaker 0: I would guess it's definitely puppet category that has a balloon for a head and an actual sword.

593
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:40,000
Speaker 0: And so these two identical puppets, you control one of them and whoever's head gets popped by a sword first wins as long as the swords are equally sharp and they're manufactured identically.

594
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,282
Speaker 0: This seems fair to me.

595
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:47,467
Speaker 0: It looks much more, much more advanced and awesome looking than Rock'em Sock'em robots.

596
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:48,768
Speaker 0: It's equally safe.

597
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,250
Speaker 0: It's probably the safest way to have a real sword fight.

598
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:54,493
Speaker 0: It seems like a lot of fun.

599
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,958
Speaker 0: I really want to play, but I think it's a one off so far.

600
00:39:56,998 --> 00:40:02,550
Speaker 0: Who knows if this will become a, you know, I don't think you could have children play this because they'd hurt themselves with the swords.

601
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:12,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but two adults at, say, a Penny Arcade Expo, a Megathon finale with a big bespoke version of that on stage, that would be legendary.

602
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:15,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think this is just frickin' awesome.

603
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,249
Speaker 0: I hope that they get a patent for this and start selling it.

604
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:19,087
Speaker 1: I'd buy it.

605
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:19,919
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,438
Speaker 1: I mean, I almost bought Clask.

607
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:24,246
Speaker 1: Clask I almost bought, but I didn't.

608
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:24,950
Speaker 1: I would buy this.

609
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,310
Speaker 0: I mean, even if you don't use this a lot, this is so, it's just the fact that this is it.

610
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,110
Speaker 1: You bust this out at a party once and it pays for itself no matter how much it costs.

611
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:35,316
Speaker 0: I know, right?

612
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:36,203
Speaker 0: I'd pay a few hundred.

613
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:36,849
Speaker 0: Anyway.

614
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:46,390
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, the last of the Murderbot Diaries, or at least the next Murderbot Diary, I bet there'll be more, came out today.

615
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,977
Speaker 0: Oh, did it really?

616
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,410
Speaker 0: I was about to look it up.

617
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,860
Speaker 1: Today was the day I had on my calendar.

618
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,784
Speaker 1: that said it comes out.

619
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,070
Speaker 1: I did not confirm.

620
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,330
Speaker 0: I'm confirming, you just keep talking.

621
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:56,511
Speaker 0: Yep.

622
00:40:56,812 --> 00:41:01,770
Speaker 1: So, the Murderbot Diaries, the whole set of them, all the Murderbots are the Geek Nights Book Club.

623
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:07,149
Speaker 1: Since, unless I am wrong and Scott's about to correct me, the last one, or the most recent one, just came out.

624
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:08,577
Speaker 1: Read that one.

625
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:09,443
Speaker 1: Read all of them.

626
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:10,350
Speaker 1: They're very short reads.

627
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,410
Speaker 1: And in a few weeks, we're going to do the episode on the collected Murderbot Diaries.

628
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,413
Speaker 0: System collapse.

629
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:18,639
Speaker 0: Book seven of seven.

630
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:22,510
Speaker 0: The Murderbot Diaries is on sale.

631
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,230
Speaker 1: Yes.

632
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:24,526
Speaker 1: Right now.

633
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:26,776
Speaker 1: I really like these books.

634
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,422
Speaker 1: I got a lot to say about them.

635
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,590
Speaker 1: I think it'll be a good book club episode.

636
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:39,270
Speaker 1: So, I highly recommend you read a bunch of them because I really want to talk about it in the context of assuming you've read these books.

637
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,790
Speaker 1: Murderbot is a delightful character.

638
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,333
Speaker 0: November 14th.

639
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:43,440
Speaker 0: It was released today.

640
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,688
Speaker 0: I guess I know what I'm doing later.

641
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:45,070
Speaker 0: Alright.

642
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:48,469
Speaker 0: If I- Even though I am still reading The Iliad, though.

643
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:49,612
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

644
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:50,496
Speaker 1: The Iliad.

645
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,790
Speaker 1: I feel like we might have to do a pause and do a special book club just on that book.

646
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,970
Speaker 0: We don't need to do an episode on it just because I'm reading it.

647
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,077
Speaker 1: I think we should do an episode on it.

648
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,689
Speaker 1: I feel like I'll have a lot to say.

649
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,928
Speaker 0: We're going to go to Pax Unplugged.

650
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:02,451
Speaker 1: Yep.

651
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:05,010
Speaker 1: We're going to be at Pax Unplugged doing two events.

652
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,770
Speaker 1: We are teaching the basics of trick taking, including how to be good at them, or at least reasonably good at them.

653
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:12,174
Speaker 1: We're not pros.

654
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:17,050
Speaker 1: We're not the best trick taking players in the world, but I'm going to say we're pretty good at trick taking games.

655
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,869
Speaker 1: And if you follow our advice, you'll be most of your friends at most trick taking games.

656
00:42:22,411 --> 00:42:24,296
Speaker 1: And we're doing a panel.

657
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:29,390
Speaker 1: 59 minutes of us talking about nothing but worker placement.

658
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:38,670
Speaker 1: And the more sub-research I've done to put these slides together, yeah, we could do a four-hour panel on worker placement and not run out of stuff to say.

659
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:40,430
Speaker 0: I mean, that's a pretty big one.

660
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,352
Speaker 1: It is a pretty big one.

661
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:47,470
Speaker 1: We picked the easiest one that we have the most opinions about first because that makes it easy for us to make a panel.

662
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,489
Speaker 1: If we talk about Rondels, that's going to be a harder one to put together, I think.

663
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,740
Speaker 0: Yep.

664
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,701
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we'll see you at Pax Unplugged.

665
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:57,385
Speaker 1: We're going to be there.

666
00:42:57,405 --> 00:42:58,190
Speaker 1: It's going to be a good time.

667
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,056
Speaker 1: If you're there, say hi, play some games.

668
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:04,090
Speaker 1: And I feel like we should just get right into Cobalt Core.

669
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:13,010
Speaker 0: So, when we were at Pax West, one of the games we saw in the expo hall that I saw briefly from -- I didn't play it.

670
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,685
Speaker 0: I just saw -- maybe I played it for like two seconds, but I just saw it briefly and I could tell right away.

671
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:18,748
Speaker 0: I'm like, "That's the

672
00:43:18,788 --> 00:43:19,029
Speaker 0: game.".

673
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,299
Speaker 0: I could see right from here that that's one of the games.

674
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,202
Speaker 0: I got to take a photo.

675
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:24,305
Speaker 0: I got to write it down.

676
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:25,770
Speaker 0: I got to add it to my Steam wish list.

677
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:27,549
Speaker 0: That's going to be one of the games.

678
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,102
Speaker 1: I similarly -- I took a photo with my phone because that's how I remind myself.

679
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,210
Speaker 1: this is something to check into a few months after the con.

680
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,256
Speaker 1: And Scott and I both had the same opinion.

681
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:43,868
Speaker 1: We saw it and we said, "Wow, that's just FTL crossed with Slay the

682
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:44,209
Speaker 1: Spire.".

683
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,130
Speaker 1: And those are both great, so I assume this is going to be great.

684
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are many games that are trying to be Slay the Spire.

685
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:50,818
Speaker 0: Yep.

686
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,530
Speaker 0: Just like there's many games that are trying to be Vampire Survivors, right?

687
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:59,430
Speaker 0: And most of them, you know, are okay to, you know, different varying levels of quality.

688
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,770
Speaker 1: But kind of like how there's a lot of deck buildings.

689
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've played a handful.

690
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:10,147
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of deck builders out there, like tabletop ones, but Dominion kind of is just better than 99% of them.

691
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,704
Speaker 1: Same thing, Slay the Spire is just better than 99% of its clones.

692
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:26,608
Speaker 0: But Cobalt Core, having played this one, I was like, "Okay, let's see how it, you know, compares to the others in this sort of category of solo, rogue deck building kind of

693
00:44:26,648 --> 00:44:26,949
Speaker 0: deals.".

694
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:32,950
Speaker 0: And I got to say, this is the first one that might actually be better than Slay the Spire.

695
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,773
Speaker 1: I would agree.

696
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:36,502
Speaker 1: It is added, because Slay the Spire is as good as it is.

697
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,850
Speaker 1: Like, I still play it, like, just kind of often.

698
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:40,030
Speaker 0: I haven't played it in years.

699
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,850
Speaker 1: Well, because I'm trying to hit Ascension 20 with every character, and I'm getting close.

700
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,290
Speaker 0: Okay.

701
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:55,590
Speaker 1: But Slay the Spire does have some fairly narrow boundaries of what is possible, and you're kind of always just looking for the broken, infinite, lucky combo.

702
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,150
Speaker 1: But it's within pretty hard bounds of what cards can do.

703
00:45:01,673 --> 00:45:03,950
Speaker 1: Now, on the other side, FTL, another game.

704
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:22,630
Speaker 1: FTL's main flaw, if I have to ascribe to it a primary flaw, is that no matter how good you are at it, you are so deeply beholden to randomly getting the items and weapons you want, that you can't apply that much, like, planning to FTL.

705
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:25,895
Speaker 1: This game has solved both of those problems.

706
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:35,890
Speaker 1: In terms of comparing it to Slay the Spire, it added a few more degrees of freedom to what is possible, and that opens up the fucking game in a way you wouldn't believe.

707
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:43,890
Speaker 1: And compared to FTL, it gets rid of the things that just fuck you randomly in FTL, and gives you all the good parts of FTL.

708
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:48,810
Speaker 0: So, the way this game works is, obviously, you have a deck of cards, right?

709
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,410
Speaker 0: And on your turn, you have some, you know, three energy, right?

710
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,078
Speaker 0: And you can play three energy worth of cards.

711
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,370
Speaker 0: All the rest of the cards get discarded, and then you draw a new hand.

712
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:07,550
Speaker 0: And what you're doing is, those cards, what they're interacting with, in Slay the Spire, you just have a character who is attacking and defending against enemies.

713
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:09,596
Speaker 0: Here, you have a spaceship.

714
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:14,490
Speaker 0: And the spaceship has pieces, right, that are each in a column.

715
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:20,690
Speaker 0: And one of those, depending on the ship you have, but the normal ship you're going to start with has a cannon in one of those columns.

716
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:25,710
Speaker 0: So when you shoot, you're only doing damage in that column, and the enemy is opposite you.

717
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:34,530
Speaker 0: So you want to play a card that attacks when your cannon is in the same column as a piece of the enemy's ship, so that you can hit them.

718
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:37,590
Speaker 1: And you can play a card that attacks for some amount of damage.

719
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:42,409
Speaker 0: And you can also play cards that put up shields, which just block incoming damage.

720
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:45,810
Speaker 1: Well, put up persistent shields until you've filled them, or temporary shields.

721
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:50,870
Speaker 1: You can play cards that give you the ability to move your ship, arbitrarily.

722
00:46:51,830 --> 00:47:01,810
Speaker 1: So you're banking this resource now of not just shields and damage and life, but I have eight moves of my ship, so I might move my ship a bunch to the right or a bunch to the left.

723
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:06,990
Speaker 1: In this infinite sea of movement, and the enemy ship also moves, you can play cards that just move you.

724
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,815
Speaker 1: You can play cards that shoot missiles.

725
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:12,990
Speaker 1: You can play cards that drop drones and things of various kinds.

726
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,109
Speaker 0: Yep, it's like there's quite a lot of things that you can do.

727
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:28,770
Speaker 0: And it's like, wow, there's really a lot of different systems going on here that are all interacting with each other in ways that make sense, and it doesn't actually get complicated.

728
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:34,790
Speaker 0: It's like they added a lot of systems without it becoming a mess, right?

729
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:39,361
Speaker 0: It's like, wow, usually when people add that many systems, it becomes a big bag of nonsense, right?

730
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:48,090
Speaker 0: But it's like, no, it all kind of works together, and it's actually an interesting challenge.

731
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:57,370
Speaker 0: You're like, okay, these are the cards I have, what order can I play them in to do the most damage to the enemy and have the least damage to myself?

732
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:01,950
Speaker 0: And you repeat that over and over and over again until you win or lose.

733
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:10,930
Speaker 1: And I guess, so it has surpassed some of the limitations of Slave Aspire, like it's just better in terms of the options you have available and the degrees of freedom.

734
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:18,830
Speaker 1: It's better than FTL in that it gets rid of the parts of FTL that actually are not fun, but scratches that same itch.

735
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:26,290
Speaker 1: And then it's also got this dimension of cute characters and funny dialogue, and there is a plot.

736
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:30,419
Speaker 0: So the way it works is you start with these three characters, right?

737
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:34,630
Speaker 0: And each character has a set of starting cards that go in your deck.

738
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:43,030
Speaker 0: And then you unlock more characters, and whenever you start a run, you choose which three characters you're going to bring with you.

739
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:52,490
Speaker 0: Now, even though there's only, I think, eight characters, if you unlock all of them, and that's not a spoiler because there's like eight squares on the left, it shows you that.

740
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:54,293
Speaker 0: You just don't know who they all are.

741
00:48:56,698 --> 00:48:57,960
Speaker 0: You can combine any three.

742
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:02,870
Speaker 0: So it's like, unlike Slave Aspire, where there's basically like three characters.

743
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,069
Speaker 0: I don't know if they add any more.

744
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's four.

745
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,141
Speaker 1: Well, you haven't played with the fourth one.

746
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:09,410
Speaker 1: You should check out that fourth character.

747
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,270
Speaker 0: Which one's the fourth one?

748
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,727
Speaker 0: The monk.

749
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:15,590
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I stopped playing like shortly when that came out, yeah.

750
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:21,690
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's like, if you choose three of eight, how many possible combinations are there?

751
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:23,524
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

752
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,270
Speaker 1: A lot, actually.

753
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,592
Speaker 0: A lot, yeah.

754
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:33,030
Speaker 0: So it's like, there's a lot of different options for your starting deck, and each character, their starting cards have like a completely different system.

755
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,740
Speaker 0: One character has like pretty basic, a lot of shield cards with a few attack cards.

756
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,110
Speaker 0: Another character has a lot of attack cards and a lot of immediate movement.

757
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:47,049
Speaker 0: Another character has a lot of move how you want to move kind of cards, right?

758
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:53,390
Speaker 0: Another character has a lot of, you know, missiles and obstacles to play with the middle system, right?

759
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:58,410
Speaker 0: That's going, you know, automatic turrets and meteors and all those sorts of, and so on and so forth.

760
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:05,850
Speaker 0: Each character has a completely different like system of way their cards work, almost like a different color in Magic the Gathering, right?

761
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:13,750
Speaker 0: And then you go on a run with like this completely, and you can't actually customize your deck too much.

762
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:24,910
Speaker 0: It's really easy to add garbage cards to your deck, but it's actually kind of difficult to like remove cards, and it's pretty rare to get upgraded cards.

763
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,196
Speaker 1: So the cards end up like a lot of good tabletop war games.

764
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:34,550
Speaker 1: They give you like the boundaries of what are the possibilities for this turn, like what are my options?

765
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:39,470
Speaker 1: So imagine you're the captain of the ship, and you're like, engineering, what do you got for me?

766
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,089
Speaker 1: And they're like, well, I can launch some drones or we can fire the cannon, but I can't do both.

767
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:45,152
Speaker 0: Yep.

768
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:50,390
Speaker 0: And so then, so all that customization is going on, and then you can unlock different ships, right?

769
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,690
Speaker 0: And the different ships are arranged differently and have different abilities.

770
00:50:54,651 --> 00:51:01,630
Speaker 0: My favorite one, I guess, is the one where you have two cannons, and you can freely alternate between the two cannons.

771
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:06,065
Speaker 0: And occasionally, if you get a mega upgrade, fire both of them simultaneously.

772
00:51:06,828 --> 00:51:07,470
Speaker 0: That's really great.

773
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:15,949
Speaker 1: The most fun I had is I had the basic ship, but I got the one thing that shoots every time you move, and I got another thing that like... Move a lot.

774
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:16,471
Speaker 1: Yep.

775
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:18,378
Speaker 1: And I just spam them, and you know what?

776
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,310
Speaker 1: Just like Slay the Spire, and this is where this kind of game can shine.

777
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,955
Speaker 1: They don't need to be balanced.

778
00:51:24,276 --> 00:51:28,768
Speaker 1: Occasionally, just getting a combo that's utterly broken is really, really fun.

779
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:38,250
Speaker 0: I mean, I also got the upgrade that shoot when you move and then move a lot, and I was just moving to the right a whole bunch.

780
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,788
Speaker 0: And it'd be like this strafing run with broadsides, like doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

781
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:51,690
Speaker 0: And then I made it all the way to the final boss, and I lost because I was all in on that, and I didn't have enough defense, right?

782
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:56,130
Speaker 0: And even though I was doing a ton of damage, it wasn't enough damage to put away a final boss.

783
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,830
Speaker 1: I never lost a run until I switched to hard difficulty, and I lost my first run.

784
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:05,090
Speaker 0: No, I lost once or twice on normal, and once or twice on hard.

785
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,490
Speaker 0: But I think one of the ones I lost was the very first one, and I didn't understand what the fuck was going on.

786
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:18,370
Speaker 1: I won my first one, but it was kind of lucky, honestly, because I misunderstood some mechanics, but it didn't matter because I got really lucky.

787
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:25,170
Speaker 0: On normal, I've only ever died to, other than the first run, I've only died to the final boss.

788
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,330
Speaker 0: I've obviously only died to really hard guys.

789
00:52:29,572 --> 00:52:32,170
Speaker 0: But there is a hardest difficulty, so who knows what the hell's going on.

790
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:32,967
Speaker 1: I haven't touched that yet.

791
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:40,710
Speaker 1: But I guess to give some examples, because you could probably do a whole panel talking about the deep design of this game.

792
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:46,610
Speaker 1: But to zoom in on a few specific examples to show you where this has surpassed the games that it is based on.

793
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:48,134
Speaker 1: And it's clearly based on them.

794
00:52:48,174 --> 00:52:53,770
Speaker 1: There is no universe where the designers of this game did not sit down and say, "We're gonna cross FTL and Slay the

795
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:53,930
Speaker 1: Spire.".

796
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,490
Speaker 0: No, without Slay the Spire, Cobalt Core does not exist.

797
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,669
Speaker 1: Without FTL, I don't know if this game exists.

798
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,040
Speaker 0: Who knows, but...

799
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,610
Speaker 1: So example one, in Slay the Spire...

800
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,990
Speaker 0: I think without FTL, Slay the Spire might not exist.

801
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,229
Speaker 1: I think that's true as well.

802
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,170
Speaker 1: So here's a very specific example.

803
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:12,449
Speaker 1: In Slay the Spire, there's cards, and they all have a unique thing.

804
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:18,490
Speaker 1: You can, over various ways over the course of the game, upgrade a card, and this game has the same mechanic.

805
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:24,390
Speaker 1: But Slay the Spire, it's just, here's the card, here is the upgraded, slightly better version of that card.

806
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:30,290
Speaker 1: This game, every card, you can choose what aspect of it to upgrade.

807
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:36,290
Speaker 1: So, multi-shot, a card that costs one energy and just does two attacks.

808
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,770
Speaker 1: Well, you could make it cheaper, or you could make it do more damage.

809
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:42,450
Speaker 1: Pick your poison.

810
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,750
Speaker 0: Every card has an A upgrade and a B upgrade.

811
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:53,629
Speaker 1: That level of choosing your tuning removes one of the big frustrations of Slay the Spire of, "You just might not get what you

812
00:53:53,649 --> 00:53:53,830
Speaker 1: want.".

813
00:53:53,870 --> 00:54:01,130
Speaker 1: Like, you can decide the direction you want to take your deck with more granularity in this game, and that is more satisfying to the player.

814
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:06,530
Speaker 0: Another funny example, there's this guy you can meet randomly.

815
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:13,750
Speaker 0: Oh, Dracula's great, but there's a guy who will give you, for free, a completely worthless card.

816
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:23,410
Speaker 0: Like, one of the examples is a card that, I think it costs one, or it costs one or zero, but it basically does three attacks for zero damage each.

817
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,330
Speaker 0: So it just goes like, pew, pew, pew, nothing, nothing, nothing, right?

818
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:29,910
Speaker 0: And he also has a card that's like, move right, move left, move right, move left.

819
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:32,485
Speaker 0: It's like, you just end up back where you started.

820
00:54:32,546 --> 00:54:33,290
Speaker 0: It doesn't do anything.

821
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:38,630
Speaker 1: Now think back, we both had that power once, you play a card that every time you move you shoot, suddenly that card's really useful.

822
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:45,510
Speaker 0: Right, it's like these completely garbage cards, but if you get the perfect combo with them, they're insane.

823
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,770
Speaker 0: Like, there are some abilities that are like, yeah, add X damage to every attack.

824
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:55,406
Speaker 0: It's like, wait, so suddenly three zero strength attacks is now three.

825
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:56,449
Speaker 0: seventh strength attacks.

826
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,470
Speaker 0: Twenty-one damage, eat it, right?

827
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,860
Speaker 0: Which is a lot in this game.

828
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,130
Speaker 0: Like, three damage is a lot in this game.

829
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:08,325
Speaker 0: Each battle is generally like, it takes a little while to wear out the enemy.

830
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:09,770
Speaker 0: You're not getting a lot of one-hit kills.

831
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,190
Speaker 1: And you're making a lot of honestly challenging tactical decisions.

832
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:22,489
Speaker 1: Like, do I eat some damage, or like, wear down my shields, but just go apeshit on that cockpit, because I already cracked the cockpit.

833
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:22,870
Speaker 1: It's weak.

834
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:32,050
Speaker 0: I think the luckiest I ever got was there's a guy you can visit who will rearrange the pieces of your ship randomly, and I always let him do it.

835
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,904
Speaker 1: I always let him do it.

836
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,463
Speaker 0: He makes your hull stronger by two, and I'm like, yeah, all right, I'll deal with the rearrangement.

837
00:55:37,523 --> 00:55:39,530
Speaker 0: Give me the two hull, which is HP.

838
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:50,690
Speaker 0: He put my cannon all the way on the right, and I was like, oh my god, I just hung out with only my cannon hitting the enemy, and the rest of my ship way to the left where the enemy couldn't hit it.

839
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:56,190
Speaker 0: And I just kept moving left so that they couldn't hit me unless they hit me in the cannon, right?

840
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:01,210
Speaker 0: But it's like, only my cannon was just poking the right side of their ship, right?

841
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:04,930
Speaker 0: I won that one so easily with that setup.

842
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,606
Speaker 1: So here's another example now of where this has surpassed FTL.

843
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:17,550
Speaker 1: FTL, you get money, like scrap, over the course of the game, and it's kind of like fiddly random amounts, so you'll have some amount of this currency.

844
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:28,090
Speaker 1: And then you'll encounter shops, and you can buy things with the currency, but 90% of the time, you do not have enough currency to buy anything interesting that you want to buy.

845
00:56:28,773 --> 00:56:30,370
Speaker 1: Or you're very limited in what you can buy.

846
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,810
Speaker 1: In this game, if you come to a shop, the options always boil down to get a thing.

847
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,832
Speaker 1: There's no currency.

848
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:43,650
Speaker 1: It's just get a thing, get a better thing, but pay some extra penalty for it, or do a different thing.

849
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:49,490
Speaker 1: Like, every option is equal but different, but you always get to avail the option.

850
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:58,808
Speaker 1: You never get to a shop, and sorry, you only have 187 scrap, and the thing you want to buy costs 200, and everything that costs under 187 sucks.

851
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,579
Speaker 1: Fuck you that FTL had.

852
00:57:02,103 --> 00:57:03,029
Speaker 0: Every space is good.

853
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:07,010
Speaker 0: If something has a cost, and it's not free, it's always something you have.

854
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,322
Speaker 0: Alright, you can have this.

855
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:10,450
Speaker 0: I'll take one of your cards.

856
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:12,539
Speaker 0: Oh, you can have this.

857
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,290
Speaker 0: I'm going to take some of your hull off your ship.

858
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:20,090
Speaker 0: You can have this, but you have to add a bunch of garbage cards to your deck, and then I'll let you have it.

859
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,654
Speaker 1: Do you want a free artifact?

860
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:27,230
Speaker 1: Do you want your choice of four artifacts, but I'm going to do some damage to you, or do you just want to heal yourself?

861
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:32,344
Speaker 0: Right, it's like there's always, basically, there's no separate currency.

862
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:34,210
Speaker 0: Every option is always possible.

863
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,511
Speaker 1: I love that.

864
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,443
Speaker 1: That is a tabletop design pattern as opposed to a video game design pattern.

865
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,530
Speaker 1: I'm sick of fiddly currencies unless it's an 18xx game.

866
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:48,450
Speaker 0: You're making meaningful and tough decisions at every stop along the way.

867
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,150
Speaker 1: I'd say every decision you make in this game is meaningful.

868
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,307
Speaker 0: Or at least, you know, it's tough.

869
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,307
Speaker 1: It's like you have a shitty deck because you're stupid, and then you draw all bad cards.

870
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:57,930
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?

871
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,067
Speaker 1: That's one turn in a round.

872
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,372
Speaker 0: You can get unlucky.

873
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:16,210
Speaker 0: So the last thing is the game has a plot, and the way the plot is revealed is that the three characters that you've chosen to go on your ship with you are chatting and interacting with all the people you meet along the way at all the different stops, including the enemies that you fight.

874
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:24,590
Speaker 0: And then when you beat one run, because it's roguelike, you choose one of the three characters in your ship to regain one of their memories.

875
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,810
Speaker 0: Because basically it's that old trope of a time loop and everyone's lost all their memory.

876
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:35,030
Speaker 0: And so you can only choose one of the three characters that's on your ship to regain one of their memories.

877
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:43,070
Speaker 0: And so in order to regain all the characters' memories, well, I said there's eight characters if you unlock them all, times three.

878
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:46,877
Speaker 0: So you have to beat the game 24 times, right?

879
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:53,910
Speaker 0: And you have to beat the game with each character in your ship three times each, right?

880
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,720
Speaker 0: You can't ignore one of the characters.

881
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,430
Speaker 0: You gotta go all of them, basically.

882
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,310
Speaker 1: Now thankfully all the characters are fun and useful and interesting.

883
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:01,548
Speaker 0: So far, at least.

884
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have every character.

885
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I think I have six out of eight.

886
00:59:06,408 --> 00:59:06,650
Speaker 0: Anyway.

887
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:11,498
Speaker 0: But it's like, you have to do all that, and then I don't know what happens after that.

888
00:59:11,538 --> 00:59:16,710
Speaker 0: There might be more content beyond that, but the story is being revealed as I play.

889
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:23,990
Speaker 0: And that gives it a lot of replay value, but it doesn't have the sort of insane replay value.

890
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:30,708
Speaker 0: I guess in some sense, you might say that Slay the Spire has more replay value, because like Rym said, to get every character to 20 takes a lot.

891
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:39,050
Speaker 1: But also, to get every character to 20, like to be clear, no matter how skilled you are at that game, it is a random game.

892
00:59:39,931 --> 00:59:43,750
Speaker 0: No, but it's mostly like doing the same kind of thing.

893
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'm playing the poison lady, and what am I doing?

894
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,898
Speaker 1: I'm trying to do the poison thing, and I'm hoping I get the cards that let me do the poison thing.

895
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:15,230
Speaker 0: And then there's additional difficulty levels, I guess, but you're getting to this more complete end, but it's like there's more that drives you to keep playing than just beat the game with more difficult numbers.

896
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:15,571
Speaker 1: That is true.

897
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:22,010
Speaker 1: Like Slay the Spire, if I don't get the cards I want by the second floor, I'll just restart.

898
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:26,230
Speaker 0: But I mean, I'm talking about driving you to even launch the game and play it at all.

899
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:40,068
Speaker 0: It's like if you don't care about optimizing numbers, if you just beat Slay the Spire with one character, or like each character once, and you don't care about getting the high score or anything like that, then why would you beat it on a higher ascension?

900
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:41,170
Speaker 0: What's the incentive for you?

901
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:57,570
Speaker 0: Whereas here, there's an incentive to story the characters, the more dramatically different setups and ships and things, there's more that makes you want to open and launch the game and try again than just, "Can I play the same game again with bigger numbers this

902
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:57,750
Speaker 0: time?".

903
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:08,050
Speaker 1: But also, Slay the Spire, choosing what cards to add to your deck is the only decision that matters other than the map if you know how to play the game and are good at it.

904
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:16,090
Speaker 1: Like, you're not going to fuck up playing a round of a fight in Slay the Spire if you're even reasonably good at Slay the Spire.

905
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:27,810
Speaker 1: This game, no matter what you're doing and where you are in the game, every round of combat is a reasonably interesting decision with rare exceptions where you get a really bad draw occasionally.

906
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:28,989
Speaker 0: Or a really good draw.

907
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,781
Speaker 1: Or a really good draw like, "Yes, fire the Photonic

908
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:32,162
Speaker 1: Cannon.".

909
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,110
Speaker 1: Of course I'm firing the Photonic Cannon.

910
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,480
Speaker 0: Oh, I can play this card and win this battle.

911
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,444
Speaker 0: I play it.

912
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:38,288
Speaker 0: Next battle.

913
01:01:38,348 --> 01:01:38,690
Speaker 0: Let's go.

914
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:56,310
Speaker 0: If you enjoy a roguelike game, a deck-building game, a Slay the Spire-ish game, a single-player game, a game with cute pixelated space, animals, and ships, what's the full price of the game?

915
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,175
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

916
01:01:57,195 --> 01:01:57,801
Speaker 1: Ten bucks?

917
01:01:57,841 --> 01:01:58,850
Speaker 1: Like, it's not expensive.

918
01:01:59,170 --> 01:01:59,875
Speaker 0: I'm checking right now.

919
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:01,790
Speaker 0: It's on Steam and it's on the Switch.

920
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:08,561
Speaker 1: I would advise, if you have a Switch, get it on the Switch because it has the same UX as Slay the Spire.

921
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:14,070
Speaker 1: It's really fast and easy to play on the Switch and I think you'll play it more if you can carry it with you.

922
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:22,850
Speaker 0: I would say that you should get it on Steam because we don't know when the Switch eShop will close and if you buy it on Steam, you will have this game forever.

923
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:26,487
Speaker 1: Well, I do own Slay the Spire on both the Switch and Steam, so...

924
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:32,074
Speaker 0: If you really like spending money to buy a game two times, sure.

925
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:34,376
Speaker 0: Go knock yourself out.

926
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,799
Speaker 0: I will always prioritize getting a game.

927
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:49,770
Speaker 0: If a game's on Steam, I'm getting it on Steam because Steam is 20+ years old and no Nintendo eShop has lasted more than like 10 years, so, you know, right?

928
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:53,256
Speaker 1: I'd say there's a 5% chance.

929
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:58,470
Speaker 1: the current iteration of the eShop is the one that'll just persist console to console forever.

930
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,649
Speaker 0: There does seem to be some hints that it will continue, but there are no guarantees and history has not...

931
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:05,052
Speaker 1: Hey, I said 5%!

932
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:05,454
Speaker 1: To be clear.

933
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:09,170
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

934
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:12,156
Speaker 0: There is a sale on Cobalt Core on Steam right now.

935
01:03:12,196 --> 01:03:12,857
Speaker 0: It is $18 instead of $20.

936
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:35,910
Speaker 0: I would pay $20 no problem, but if you want to save... If you want to save $2, you have 18 hours from the time of this recording to go on Steam and buy a copy of Cobalt Core from developer Rocket Rat Games, who has also made what other games?

937
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,618
Speaker 0: Steam had an error and could not tell me what other games that they have made.

938
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:40,359
Speaker 0: Let me try.

939
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:40,580
Speaker 0: Nope!

940
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,683
Speaker 0: They still can't tell me.

941
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:42,966
Speaker 0: Let's see what the publisher.

942
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:44,730
Speaker 0: Probably also an error.

943
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:45,949
Speaker 1: Brace yourself, I think?

944
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,652
Speaker 0: Yes.

945
01:03:46,773 --> 01:03:47,801
Speaker 0: Brace yourself, games.

946
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:48,910
Speaker 0: What else have they published?

947
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:50,289
Speaker 1: Crypt of the Necrodancer.

948
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:51,815
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

949
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:53,525
Speaker 0: Yep, it's just not loading.

950
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:54,450
Speaker 0: Alright, well, whatever.

951
01:03:57,111 --> 01:04:02,990
Speaker 0: I give this game on Steam, I give it an extremely positive rating on Steam.

952
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,156
Speaker 0: I'd say it's great.

953
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,170
Speaker 1: This is where you can't compare a game like this to Breath of the Wild.

954
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:13,240
Speaker 1: But for what this is, this is 10 out of 10 for what it is.

955
01:04:14,423 --> 01:04:16,830
Speaker 1: If you like this kind of thing, 10 out of 10, no notes.

956
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,247
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

957
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:29,280
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

960
01:04:37,747 --> 01:04:42,360
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

963
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:53,300
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

964
01:04:53,581 --> 01:05:09,820
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are... ...a bunch of people who are under that $5 threshold, which is a totally fine place to be.

965
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:12,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, keep opening.

966
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:17,220
Speaker 1: Bugs, feedback, thoughts about the new website as we continue to tweak this.

967
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,320
Speaker 1: This will be the first episode where, theoretically, the forum post will happen automatically.

968
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,799
Speaker 1: We don't have to make it by hand, so we'll see what that looks like.

969
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:33,760
Speaker 1: So yeah, I leave you tonight, as I'm about to go play some Blades of the Dark with...

970
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,979
Speaker 0: ...do this with our crew, unless the trap's useless if he's not feeling it.

971
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:02,931
Speaker 0: But everyone is feeling it.

972
01:06:02,971 --> 01:06:04,239
Speaker 0: Do you even feel stuff right now?

973
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:06,699
Speaker 0: Uh, here we go again.

974
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:09,289
Speaker 0: Hey, what's the matter, fly guy?

975
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,455
Speaker 0: Why you tryin' to puff me by?

976
01:06:10,495 --> 01:06:11,440
Speaker 1: No need to be shy.

977
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,219
Speaker 0: Come give me a try, 'cause I know you can't resist my exotic little vibes.

978
01:06:15,802 --> 01:06:17,197
Speaker 0: Marco, you are ruining the plan!

979
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,809
Speaker 0: Hold up, it's working.

980
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:20,120
Speaker 0: Look at this wise man.
