1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,266
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, March 20th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:11,888
Speaker 0: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:12,669
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,233
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:16,297
Speaker 0: Tonight, cute Twitter comics.

6
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:17,420
Speaker 0: The little guys.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,138
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:32,959
Speaker 0: So if any of you saw some of our recent panels that were uploaded, you might have noticed that all our panels from PAX is for a while now and MagFest have been, not just in 4k, but multiple camera angles.

9
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:42,620
Speaker 0: Not the old way where there's one really good camera and then one really bad camera because I got that fancy new camera and Scott has his good camera.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,309
Speaker 0: So we actually have two good 4k cameras to record our stuff.

11
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:51,479
Speaker 0: However, my fancy new camera suffered from an internal lens crash.

12
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:59,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd never seen anything like that in my life short of a camera being physically, you know, manhandled in a bad way.

13
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:04,200
Speaker 0: If I had dropped this camera down the stairs, I would have expected something like that to happen.

14
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:33,318
Speaker 0: But from what I gathered talking to people about it, because the camera's gonna be fine, this is the kind of thing that can happen with running guns and studio cameras if they are spun or moved too quickly while they're being powered down or right after they're powered off because the lens has a pretty big stabilizer thing in it and it basically has to move the lens to a spot and like lock it and it's a race condition that can happen in a lot of different cameras like that.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:42,239
Speaker 0: Anyway, what happened was one of the internal lenses crashed into another internal lens and scratched the shit out of it.

16
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:48,200
Speaker 0: So after the last PAX, I go to turn it back on and it just doesn't turn on.

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,003
Speaker 0: I'm like, what the fuck?

18
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:53,423
Speaker 0: And then it's like lens error and I shook it a little bit and then I tried to turn it on again and it turned on.

19
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:56,494
Speaker 0: fine, but then I had like.

20
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,258
Speaker 0: the video quality looks kind of bad, like there's something wrong with it.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,340
Speaker 0: I turn around and look inside and there's this big, these two white lines on the lens like way inside.

22
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:06,519
Speaker 0: I show it to Scott and Scott's like, what the fuck?

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,780
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell happened.

24
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:10,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird that you said they're gonna repair it for nothing.

25
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:11,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:19,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess when my camera had a problem, it was actually a well-known problem that the HDMI port, it was like this micro HDMI port and it was weak.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,286
Speaker 1: Yeah.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,700
Speaker 1: And it was well-known to be weak, but when I wanted to repair it after it finally broke, which it lasted much longer than what other people had, other people had to break right away.

29
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,000
Speaker 1: They would not repair it for cheap or even or free at all.

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,840
Speaker 1: They wanted me to pay a ridiculous amount of money.

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:46,200
Speaker 1: So I ended up just buying a newer camera, which is basically this, you know, the, the, I went from GH4 to GH5 and mostly because GH5 has a full size HDMI port that is like invincible.

32
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:46,598
Speaker 1: Yup.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,860
Speaker 1: And they even give you like this little bracket so that like the wire can't get tugged on and stuff.

34
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:51,779
Speaker 1: It screws in.

35
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,620
Speaker 1: So I don't think I need to upgrade.

36
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,499
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have upgraded if it weren't for that.

37
00:02:55,841 --> 00:03:00,920
Speaker 1: So then I sold my GH4 to someone who did not need the HDMI port because the rest of it worked just fine.

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,800
Speaker 0: So basically, if I had just bought the camera, I would have had to pay for that repair probably.

39
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,940
Speaker 0: But it's probably, it looks like it'd only be like a thousand bucks or something because it's a lot of money.

40
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:12,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but relative to the cost of the camera.

41
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:19,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for me, a thousand dollar repair was basically, I could have bought a GH4 new for $800.

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,720
Speaker 0: I mean, to be fair, a thousand dollars would be like approaching, like that's actually a little less than a third of the cost of the camera.

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:36,480
Speaker 1: By the way, if anyone out there is listening and is like, you know, thinking, I want to get a camera, you can buy like GH4 or GH4 era digital cameras for like almost no money.

44
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:39,200
Speaker 1: And they are ridiculous for what you're paying.

45
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:45,700
Speaker 0: Even for video, they won't have like the really common like usability features of a fancy camcorder.

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,800
Speaker 0: But if you're willing to put up with that annoyance, the picture quality is phenomenal.

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,058
Speaker 1: I don't think there's that much annoyance.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,700
Speaker 0: Well, like having XLR built in and stuff like that.

49
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:55,620
Speaker 1: You can get the thing that attaches to the bottom.

50
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,680
Speaker 1: How much does that thing cost?

51
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can probably get it for way cheap because no one fucking wants it.

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, last time I looked, it was still expensive.

53
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, to buy like a new one at MSRP.

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,438
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you can find someone with a used one who's like, I got rid of my GH4.

55
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:12,820
Speaker 0: Basically, for a camcorder like this, like the cost of the lens is about a third the cost of the camera itself.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,199
Speaker 0: The lens is a big part of the cost of a camera like that.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:25,899
Speaker 0: But because I bought this camera on Amazon, even though I got it direct from the manufacturer, just like through Amazon, one, I got the 5% off because Amazon card like, duh.

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:34,540
Speaker 0: And two, I bought the like $70 will fucking fix it, no questions asked thing that Amazon always tries to sell you.

59
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:39,300
Speaker 1: Whenever I see a pop up for any kind of warranty or anything like that, I never get it unless it's AppleCare.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:58,412
Speaker 0: Well, so my policy has always been if it's technology that I'm spending more than a couple thousand dollars on and it's technology that I'm going to be using and carrying around as opposed to just it's in my house and it never moves, I'll often pay the pittance for whatever insurance company to do the.

61
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,720
Speaker 0: we'll just fix it, no questions asked for like three years thing.

62
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I also feel like, you know, I already have, you know, like renter's insurance, renter's insurance wouldn't have covered this.

63
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,965
Speaker 1: No, but I also have like.

64
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:15,735
Speaker 1: if you buy something with your credit card, you have like purchase protection that depends on your credit card.

65
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,264
Speaker 1: But like just buying something with a credit card.

66
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:27,440
Speaker 1: if your credit card offers purchase protection means you automatically have like a warranty against theft and damage for some amount of time.

67
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't actually know if my card has that because I haven't had to use it.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,820
Speaker 0: So here's my thinking, this is a big ass, like run and gun professional camera that I'm going to be carrying around conventions.

69
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,100
Speaker 1: And then there's the warranty you get just by default for the manufacturer.

70
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,320
Speaker 0: And the warranty on it's really good because it's a fancy camera.

71
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:52,600
Speaker 0: But I paid seventy dollars for the insurance that says if you fucking drop this in the ocean because you're dumb, we'll just replace it.

72
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,699
Speaker 0: No questions asked.

73
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:04,180
Speaker 0: So I assumed at some point, like over the next three years, like some nerd would like trip on me and break my camera in an expo hall at a PAX or something.

74
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,800
Speaker 0: But this thing happened and I'm going to get it fixed for free that I just got to ship it to him.

75
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,580
Speaker 0: They're going to fix it and it's all going to tell me most of the time those insurances are a scam, but I guess they still actually work.

76
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,780
Speaker 0: So if you do pay, I had to do a lot of paperwork, but I did it all and it seems like it's going to work.

77
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:25,500
Speaker 0: But the only reason I trusted this one at all was that a lot of paperwork for a thousand dollars seems fair.

78
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:25,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

79
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:26,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

80
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:33,500
Speaker 0: Like if you crash your car and you're going to have your insurance company like pay for the whole car, they're going to make you fill out a couple of forms.

81
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,338
Speaker 0: They're not just going to do it.

82
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:35,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

83
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:37,724
Speaker 0: So the more.

84
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:46,160
Speaker 0: the only reason I trusted this was that I bought it through Amazon because when I bought the camera, what I assumed was suppose I try to use this insurance and it doesn't work.

85
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,739
Speaker 0: I'm going to call I'm going to go after Amazon.

86
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

87
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:53,091
Speaker 1: I'm going to go first of all, tell him as on customer service and then I'll go to.

88
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,520
Speaker 1: I'll go to small claims court if I have to say, hey, I bought this fucking warranty.

89
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Speaker 1: It says this and they won't pay up because in my interactions with Amazon over, you know, a small claims court for a thousand dollars.

90
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,660
Speaker 0: I guess it's like three grand the limit.

91
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,063
Speaker 0: I forget.

92
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:06,770
Speaker 0: I don't know what is.

93
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,739
Speaker 1: what the hell do I know?

94
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,600
Speaker 0: I think it's actually three grand.

95
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:12,706
Speaker 0: What is the limit?

96
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,960
Speaker 0: Ten grand to change?

97
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:20,460
Speaker 0: Except the plaintiff may not file a claim for over twenty five hundred dollars more than twice a year.

98
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,160
Speaker 0: That's actually a good rule.

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,100
Speaker 1: You can't be an asshole.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,260
Speaker 0: And if you take someone to small claims court more than like once every few years, I feel like you're the asshole.

101
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:31,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, most likely.

102
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:44,500
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I figured every time I've ever had a problem with anything I bought on Amazon, even if it was possibly my fault or like it's a dubious situation, Amazon's response has always been.

103
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:45,716
Speaker 0: Here's the thing for free.

104
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,000
Speaker 0: Sorry.

105
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,800
Speaker 0: That's why we have multiple of this leather.

106
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,099
Speaker 1: Only one time did they fuck me over.

107
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've never fucked me over.

108
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,580
Speaker 0: I think they in fact, for reasons.

109
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,340
Speaker 0: Remember when I thought that monitor that got shipped to me was a bomb?

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,424
Speaker 0: Yeah.

111
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:04,740
Speaker 0: So the end result of all that was I got a free four K monitor because Amazon.

112
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,839
Speaker 0: So one of these four K monitors was free in the end.

113
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:14,720
Speaker 0: And the person who was holding the bag is either Amazon or the scammer.

114
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,700
Speaker 0: I don't care who held the bag because the bag contained not a bomb, but a free four K monitor.

115
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:26,420
Speaker 0: That is a legit ultra sharp that I registered for the warranty to make sure it wasn't like weird gray market.

116
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,249
Speaker 0: No, it's legit.

117
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:28,080
Speaker 0: It's real.

118
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,524
Speaker 0: It's good.

119
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:29,818
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

120
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,280
Speaker 0: So what this means is that I'm not videoing any of our panels as thank icon because I don't care.

121
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,261
Speaker 0: I don't.

122
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:40,779
Speaker 0: I just don't video anything in a small town because they're not going to have like lighting or like the stuff.

123
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:51,360
Speaker 0: And do it means we're only going to have one camera on the new panel at PAX East, the real harm of games, because my camcorder is not going to come back until shortly after PAX East.

124
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,080
Speaker 0: So I feel like that's fine.

125
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,640
Speaker 1: You can rent a camera if you really want.

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,562
Speaker 0: I don't care that much.

127
00:08:57,622 --> 00:09:00,049
Speaker 0: All this means is that if your camera messes up, there's no video.

128
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:04,300
Speaker 0: because every now and then we mess up like there's a couple of panels where like Scott's camera was fine.

129
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,340
Speaker 0: But like I derp the autofocus or I derp the focus.

130
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,285
Speaker 0: So mine's blurry.

131
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:10,300
Speaker 0: So we didn't use mine like that's happened.

132
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,980
Speaker 0: Sometimes Scott's camera was set up wrong and mine was fine.

133
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:21,000
Speaker 0: Sometimes like Scott's camera is perfect, but nerd like bumps it while we're on stage and then it's ruined for the second half of the panel.

134
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,380
Speaker 0: So anyway, that's what happened to me.

135
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,678
Speaker 0: My camera is going to get fixed.

136
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:31,980
Speaker 1: OK, so for as long as I've been, as long as I can remember.

137
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:32,643
Speaker 1: Right.

138
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,700
Speaker 1: Conan the Barbaro comics came from Dark Horse Comics.

139
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,381
Speaker 1: Right.

140
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:40,580
Speaker 1: And no one was really reading new ones so much.

141
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,300
Speaker 1: There are legendary old ones that are amazing and they kept making new ones occasionally.

142
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:52,720
Speaker 1: I don't really know because I didn't pay that much attention, but I always knew the Conan the Barbaro comics are in the Dark Horse section of previews.

143
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,460
Speaker 0: I will admit, I know almost nothing about Conan or the canon of Conan.

144
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,081
Speaker 1: By Grom.

145
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:11,600
Speaker 1: Conan is basically just like sword and sorcery, but it's best incarnation, but also its most classic incarnation.

146
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:12,849
Speaker 1: Anyway.

147
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:13,276
Speaker 1: Yeah.

148
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,791
Speaker 1: Regardless, what's happened is Marvel, meaning Disney, has the rights for publishing.

149
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:27,600
Speaker 1: Conan comics have fallen away from Dark Horse and gone back to the Marvel after a very long period of time.

150
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:33,339
Speaker 1: And they got some new Marvel Conan comics that are brand new.

151
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,639
Speaker 1: Don't know how good they are.

152
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,203
Speaker 1: Don't care.

153
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:37,080
Speaker 1: Craziness.

154
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,320
Speaker 1: They just can't fucking help themselves.

155
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,920
Speaker 1: Conan the Barbarian is now an Avenger.

156
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,316
Speaker 0: I've all right.

157
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,240
Speaker 1: Conan, for all history, Conan comics have always been their own thing, not in any universe.

158
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,359
Speaker 1: For the first time, they're like, you know what?

159
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,298
Speaker 1: Because we can.

160
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:57,240
Speaker 1: We're just going to throw Conan on some Avengers team.

161
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,860
Speaker 1: It's like Savage Avengers or some shit.

162
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,540
Speaker 0: So what can Conan and Thor go?

163
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,197
Speaker 1: Like, I don't fucking know.

164
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,820
Speaker 1: Like Conan and the Vision and Scarlet Witch.

165
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:06,670
Speaker 1: All right.

166
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,200
Speaker 1: Whatever.

167
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,680
Speaker 1: Why not Conan and Wolverine?

168
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:10,939
Speaker 1: Probably that's what you're going to see.

169
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,259
Speaker 1: But anyway, don't give any shits about that.

170
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:13,961
Speaker 1: Right.

171
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:22,120
Speaker 1: What I do give a shit about is thanks to these rights, going to Marvel again, the original Marvel Conan.

172
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,359
Speaker 0: There was a what if, I think.

173
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,076
Speaker 1: OK.

174
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,960
Speaker 0: What if Wolverine battled Conan the Barbarian?

175
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:27,877
Speaker 1: There you go.

176
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:30,788
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

177
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:32,556
Speaker 1: Yep.

178
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:44,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, thanks to this, the original Conan comics, which Marvel ran for a very long time, I think, to the 90s from, you know, way back.

179
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,115
Speaker 1: That was like the ended in the 90s.

180
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,998
Speaker 1: They began way back.

181
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,679
Speaker 1: The amazing 1970, something like that.

182
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:51,698
Speaker 1: Super long time ago.

183
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:53,700
Speaker 1: They ran for like super.

184
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,380
Speaker 1: Those are now available legally.

185
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:09,760
Speaker 1: And digitally from Marvel comics that have been somewhat difficult to obtain and read, unless maybe you find any legal scan somewhere or found the originals, because it's like, you know, Marvel couldn't publish a compilation of them.

186
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,195
Speaker 1: Dark Horse couldn't either, right?

187
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,300
Speaker 1: So it's like these comics, which are really, really good, although obviously a product of their time.

188
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good disclaimer to put there.

189
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,420
Speaker 1: Yes, but still really good with amazing story and artwork.

190
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Speaker 1: So if you like Sward and Sorcery and Conan, these are now available again after a very long period of time where they were not available.

191
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,509
Speaker 0: Yep.

192
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:43,760
Speaker 0: For those of you who might be too young to even know anything about Conan, like if you didn't see the movies, which you don't need to, I haven't seen those movies since I was pretty young.

193
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,340
Speaker 0: It's one of those things where, like, is it going to be a He-Man situation if I watch these movies again?

194
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,198
Speaker 0: Because I liked them.

195
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Speaker 1: This is one of those things where the comic is like the one true Conan and all other Conan's are like, they're not the same, not the real deal, get them out of here.

196
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:05,840
Speaker 0: So I think we talked about this briefly and I don't want to linger on it, but conventions are coming up and...

197
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,500
Speaker 1: Isn't this Metamoment?

198
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,325
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no.

199
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,680
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about our convention stuff.

200
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,320
Speaker 0: So in the anime world, that Vic Mignona thing is actually getting worse.

201
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,740
Speaker 1: See, it's weird when people say this, not that I just believe you, but in all the media, I read a lot of Internet, a lot, the most.

202
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a difference between the two of us.

203
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,361
Speaker 1: Right.

204
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:36,140
Speaker 1: And I see all these tweets and I see all these Facebooks and, you know, a week or two ago, a few weeks ago, and we talked about this, I saw tons and tons of tweets about this all over the place.

205
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,901
Speaker 1: Right.

206
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:42,220
Speaker 1: But I always saw the tweets from the good people saying, you know, how fucked up this thing was.

207
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:43,103
Speaker 1: All right.

208
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:47,640
Speaker 1: And then now I have not seen a Vic related tweet in since then.

209
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:48,544
Speaker 0: Not at all.

210
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:52,320
Speaker 1: So you say it's getting worse, but like I see nothing happening.

211
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,540
Speaker 1: I see no tweets from bad or good people or on any other site.

212
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:59,920
Speaker 1: I see like no news about any developments whatsoever.

213
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:10,940
Speaker 0: So part of that, I think, is that you like the people who are involved in this are increasingly so isolated from people like us that we would never encounter them unless we looked for them.

214
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:16,120
Speaker 0: And that also applies to most of the people we would even want to interact with on Twitter.

215
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:25,200
Speaker 0: Like, for example, you know, it's getting worse because the one difference between you and I is that I go to the dark places of the Internet to see what's going on on purpose.

216
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:26,824
Speaker 0: Yeah.

217
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:32,240
Speaker 0: Also, I am still tuned into a lot of the convention management that you ignore.

218
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,999
Speaker 0: And this is still a problem at conventions.

219
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,526
Speaker 0: Basically, it's gotten to the point that it's basically gamer gate.

220
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:50,440
Speaker 0: now, like the people who are mad about this are going full gamer gate and are just directly harassing and doxing other voice actors and people who run conventions.

221
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:59,719
Speaker 1: You know, this seems to be a thing that that keeps happening and, you know, where there's some sort of hubbub with a hashtag and then a war or a battle.

222
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,621
Speaker 1: Right.

223
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:09,200
Speaker 0: But the battle is always like the worst neckbeards on earth, just doxing random people that they feel like I'm saying there's a gamer gate.

224
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,858
Speaker 1: This is there's plenty of things like this.

225
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,499
Speaker 1: We should probably like learn how to win these things because they're going to happen over and over and over.

226
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,357
Speaker 0: This is like legit meme warfare.

227
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,060
Speaker 1: We should learn how to win these things.

228
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:31,440
Speaker 1: So when the next one happens, we can easily a recognize up one of those things is happening and then be deploy our arsenal and extinguish it.

229
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:38,180
Speaker 0: Well, never forget, when gamer gate first happened, a lot of people who should have known better were tricked by it.

230
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:43,100
Speaker 0: I remember in the first week you and I were both like, what is this fucking bullshit?

231
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:49,658
Speaker 0: And then immediately I see people like not getting it and scheduling panels and like companies like not understanding it.

232
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:53,639
Speaker 0: It keeps happening and people still get tricked by it.

233
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,700
Speaker 0: I feel like people aren't being tricked by this one, like the conventions all know.

234
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,340
Speaker 0: I mean, look, all the anime conventions that just disinvited Vic from the convention, they know what's up.

235
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:05,819
Speaker 0: They know exactly what's up.

236
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:06,958
Speaker 0: They did the right thing.

237
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:10,439
Speaker 0: The handful of conventions that didn't.

238
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:12,259
Speaker 0: They also know what's up.

239
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,199
Speaker 0: They're just evil.

240
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:16,900
Speaker 0: Like they're the bad conventions, like they're doing it on purpose.

241
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:19,840
Speaker 0: So it's not a matter of people being tricked anymore.

242
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,714
Speaker 0: It's a matter of what do we do about these harassment, doxing brigades, because they're really going after.

243
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,920
Speaker 0: Monica Real was nothing to do with this.

244
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,759
Speaker 0: It's just that's the person in the industry these neckbeards decided to go after.

245
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:46,420
Speaker 0: So if all I'm saying is if you work at a convention or do anything with fan conventions, if you aren't aware, this is the same bullshit as gamer gate and you need to take the same kinds of actions you took.

246
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:48,780
Speaker 0: Just blanket ban these people from the convention.

247
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:55,080
Speaker 0: Watch for fake panels coming in, trying to do stuff, put extra staff in the rooms.

248
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:02,660
Speaker 0: If you have any good voice actors, meaning most of them who might get harassed, especially if they're women, by these shit brigades.

249
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:13,800
Speaker 0: And on lighter notes, it's time for things of the day.

250
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,432
Speaker 0: What do you got?

251
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,758
Speaker 1: Which one did I go with?

252
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,019
Speaker 1: You door lock guy.

253
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,159
Speaker 0: You went with door lock guy.

254
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,479
Speaker 1: All right, so check this out.

255
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,137
Speaker 1: This dude is in his house.

256
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:27,940
Speaker 1: And he hears some kind of noise at the front door, like someone messing with his knob, the door knob, not his other knob.

257
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,380
Speaker 0: You know, the trope in every horror movie on earth.

258
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:30,725
Speaker 1: Yeah.

259
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,920
Speaker 0: Door knobs moving a little bit and you're like looking at it.

260
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,280
Speaker 1: So he goes and looks at his people and he sees someone's messing with his door lock, like trying to picket or some shit.

261
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Speaker 1: So he gets out his camera and starts filming a video, you know, just because that's what you do.

262
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,458
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

263
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 0: Like my old thing of the day of the guy in Scotland who like, he's like, he's holding his camera out the window and he's like, this guy's trying to crowbar into my house.

264
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:54,440
Speaker 0: And he already called the police.

265
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,439
Speaker 0: He's just watching and waiting.

266
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:04,140
Speaker 1: And then because the gentleman who is recording the video apparently ain't afraid of shit, he opens the door and produces an excellent thing of the day.

267
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,300
Speaker 0: He does what you and I should have done that one time at Anime Boston.

268
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:18,820
Speaker 0: One of my regrets in life is that I didn't do what is in this video that one time.

269
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, no spoilers.

270
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,699
Speaker 0: Just watch the video.

271
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,056
Speaker 0: It is.

272
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,674
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

273
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,036
Speaker 0: The best part, I think, without spoiling anything, is that the excuse the guy has is 100% BS.

274
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is, it is 100% BS, but it's amazing how he comes up with such a crazy excuse so quickly.

275
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:46,860
Speaker 0: But it's the kind of excuse that the kind of person who would break into someone's apartment by picking the lock would have at the tip of their tongue.

276
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,619
Speaker 1: And it's like, if that excuse is true, why didn't you just knock on my door and talk to me?

277
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, first, I'm pretty sure that individual was trying to steal things to buy either meth or spice.

278
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:00,959
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem to be high at the moment.

279
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,308
Speaker 0: No.

280
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,400
Speaker 0: Well, because if he was high at the moment, he doesn't need any money to go buy meth or spice.

281
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,480
Speaker 0: The problem is he is out of either meth or spice.

282
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,940
Speaker 1: He seems like a sober individual.

283
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,719
Speaker 0: Yes, he's sober now and he wants to not be sober.

284
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:14,519
Speaker 1: Wouldn't he be all sick, though?

285
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,959
Speaker 0: No, it depends.

286
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:22,440
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't want to tell a lot of anecdotes because a lot of the anecdotes I have are sad.

287
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:32,300
Speaker 0: But the kind of person that would do something like this is the kind of person that I often interacted with when I was in middle school because people like this lived in our suburb.

288
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Speaker 0: And these are the kinds of excuses they would come up with when they were caught trying to break into people's houses in, like, middle school.

289
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,179
Speaker 0: I wasn't doing anything.

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,868
Speaker 0: I was just trying to ridiculous nonsense.

291
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,000
Speaker 0: that somehow does not involve me stealing shit from your house.

292
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:58,360
Speaker 1: Usually you'd find these kids like, here's the reason why I smashed your window and was trying to lift it up and climb inside with the step ladder.

293
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,980
Speaker 0: It's like that king of the hill where it is not because I was burgling.

294
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:12,039
Speaker 0: It's like that king of the hill where Dale Gribble like breaks into Hank's garage and Hank just like comes in with a baseball bat because he sees like a shadow rummaging through his stuff and he's like, "Halt,

295
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:12,339
Speaker 0: thief!".

296
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:16,677
Speaker 0: And then he turns on the light and it's Dale and Dale's like, "No, no, no, Hank, it's just me,

297
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,019
Speaker 0: Dale.".

298
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:21,538
Speaker 0: And then Hank stands over a second and then he menaces him with the baseball bat anyway and he's like, "Halt,

299
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:21,859
Speaker 0: thief!".

300
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:23,559
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit that it's you.

301
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:31,400
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is near and dear to me because I had a similar incident happen to me at De Bellas.

302
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:32,190
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

303
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:32,939
Speaker 1: I didn't know about that.

304
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, never thought to tell the story.

305
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,545
Speaker 0: The video is simple.

306
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,540
Speaker 0: So I'm just going to read the tweet.

307
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:44,320
Speaker 0: So a couple of days ago, one of my co-workers accidentally let 22 quarts of ranch dressing slip out of her hand.

308
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,040
Speaker 1: And first you see- Why would you have 22 quarts all together in one thing?

309
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,300
Speaker 0: You've never worked in a restaurant before, have you?

310
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,200
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you could do one quart at a time.

311
00:20:54,941 --> 00:21:05,680
Speaker 0: I remember at one point carrying what was probably, like, imagine a container that is big enough to put a body in, completely filled with pickles.

312
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,900
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, that's just efficient because you want to pick them all in the same brine.

313
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,780
Speaker 0: No, that was just how they were shipped to us to then distribute.

314
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:17,320
Speaker 0: I had containers of mayonnaise that were bigger than my monitor.

315
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:21,440
Speaker 0: So the video is great because first you see the aftermath.

316
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:25,620
Speaker 0: Then you see the security camera footage of the actual incident.

317
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,360
Speaker 0: It's tragic.

318
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:29,798
Speaker 0: But so there I was.

319
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:30,918
Speaker 0: I was in De Bellas.

320
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:36,500
Speaker 0: Well, we had someone because we had a bunch of meatballs that weren't going to make it too long, like we had extra meatballs.

321
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,900
Speaker 0: So we had decided, like as a group, to just cook them all in a giant pot and just make them.

322
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,000
Speaker 0: And everyone could eat meatballs for the next few days.

323
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:50,819
Speaker 0: Like any time you want free meatballs for anyone who works here, take as much home as you want.

324
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,580
Speaker 0: Like meatballs and sauce.

325
00:21:53,761 --> 00:22:02,500
Speaker 0: I was trying to put a giant, giant container of paper towels on the highest, highest shelf, and the ladder was just fucking missing.

326
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:06,540
Speaker 0: So I'm just trying to like toss it up there and I keep failing.

327
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,020
Speaker 1: Seems like a bad idea.

328
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,139
Speaker 0: Oh, it was a terrible idea.

329
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:20,500
Speaker 0: And I eventually get it up there and then it immediately falls back down, hits me, hits this giant pot and falls on the ground.

330
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:25,880
Speaker 0: Ah, I look, no damage appears to have been done.

331
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,200
Speaker 0: The pot is intact.

332
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:28,017
Speaker 0: It's still full.

333
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:30,318
Speaker 0: No sauce got on me.

334
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:31,920
Speaker 0: No disaster.

335
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 0: So I picked the things up and I keep tossing it up there and I get it up there and it's fine.

336
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:39,840
Speaker 0: I wait for a few minutes to make sure it doesn't just like fall.

337
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:40,818
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

338
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:41,818
Speaker 0: And I leave.

339
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:54,140
Speaker 0: The next day, I come back into the office, the office, I come back into De Bellas and the manager is like, did you spill autonomy balls yesterday?

340
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,658
Speaker 0: And I was like, what?

341
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,637
Speaker 0: No, and I didn't.

342
00:22:57,303 --> 00:22:59,700
Speaker 0: And he's like, let's look at this footage.

343
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:03,520
Speaker 0: And I look at the footage and I see the incident as I described.

344
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,600
Speaker 0: There is no evidence that anything has gone wrong.

345
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:19,120
Speaker 0: What had happened that I did not see was that the container had tipped the pot sideways long enough for a shit ton of meatballs to slosh out.

346
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:24,259
Speaker 0: And just missed the wall and fall under the table behind a bunch of stuff.

347
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,520
Speaker 0: So you would not know anything had spilled unless you moved all that stuff out of the way.

348
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:42,960
Speaker 0: It was just like a perfect storm of a situation where no one would know that there was probably a couple pounds of meatballs hiding behind a table that no one could see unless they went looking for them.

349
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,380
Speaker 0: So that is my story.

350
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,380
Speaker 0: It is not that exciting.

351
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:47,920
Speaker 0: I did not get covered in meatballs.

352
00:23:48,422 --> 00:23:51,556
Speaker 1: How did they find out that that happened to the smell or rats eating them?

353
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:03,220
Speaker 0: As far as I can, like that night, someone like went to get something from the bottom of the shelf and they pulled a bunch of stuff out and then they just found a pile of meatballs and they were like, WTF, what happened?

354
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,419
Speaker 1: Otherwise you could have had a real bad problem if no one discovered them or picked them up.

355
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could have had a...

356
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,680
Speaker 1: Like a health inspection that night?

357
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that it could have.

358
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,640
Speaker 0: that could have been a. what's that smell?

359
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,639
Speaker 0: It smells like a corpse.

360
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:18,579
Speaker 0: Oh, no, there are potatoes that have rotten.

361
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:24,400
Speaker 0: So in the minute moment this weekend, I will be at Zekicon doing three panels next weekend.

362
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,099
Speaker 0: Scott and I will be at PAX East doing one panel.

363
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:28,580
Speaker 0: It's going to be awesome.

364
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:31,154
Speaker 0: The Book Club book was 2001 A Space Odyssey.

365
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,680
Speaker 0: I'm going to pick by the end of this weekend, either Troy Dennings Pages of Pain or Ninefox Gambit.

366
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,754
Speaker 0: I'm going to make a Twitter poll.

367
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:41,080
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

368
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,702
Speaker 1: You can't.

369
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,319
Speaker 1: you can't have the balls to choose on your own.

370
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:44,740
Speaker 0: I'm pretty ambivalent.

371
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,160
Speaker 0: On one hand, Ninefox Gambit sounds up my alley.

372
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:53,040
Speaker 0: On the other hand, multiple listeners have said that it is a terrifying book that they don't think people should read.

373
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:55,439
Speaker 0: But that actually makes it more up my alley.

374
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:08,240
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I'm really curious to find out if Pages of Pain is actually good or if my kid brain, coupled with the opinions of a lot of people I trust, are just way wrong.

375
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:09,465
Speaker 1: All right.

376
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:10,980
Speaker 1: Well, we got to the main bit pretty quickly.

377
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:16,737
Speaker 1: So back in the day, we read a lot of webcomics since the year 2000, tons of them.

378
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,280
Speaker 0: And then what happened is since the year 2000, Scott, I was reading webcomics in 1998.

379
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,683
Speaker 1: All right, sure.

380
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:24,599
Speaker 0: I was reading webcomics before I even went to our IT.

381
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,780
Speaker 1: We've been reading webcomics for a long time.

382
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:37,060
Speaker 1: And then what happened was is sometime, but like maybe earlier this decade, I sort of fell off the wagon with reading the webcomics because there were a lot to keep track of.

384
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,200
Speaker 1: Quite a few of them ended, even though I didn't fit.

385
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,345
Speaker 1: I guess it might have been.

386
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:42,437
Speaker 1: I can actually time it based on Dr.

387
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,401
Speaker 1: McNinja.

388
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:46,140
Speaker 1: I left off where they were entering the pyramid.

389
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:46,786
Speaker 0: I just got.

390
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:47,072
Speaker 0: Wow.

391
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:47,480
Speaker 0: Really?

392
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,219
Speaker 1: And then I kept going all the way to the end.

393
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,919
Speaker 1: And then you have no idea.

394
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,240
Speaker 1: That's around the time.

395
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,910
Speaker 1: And then I know Dr.

396
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,894
Speaker 1: McNinja ended soon after.

397
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,853
Speaker 0: You have remember in King Radical when when Dr.

398
00:25:59,863 --> 00:26:03,340
Speaker 0: McNinja asked King Radical to his face, were you up to something?

399
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,360
Speaker 0: And he said, yeah, yeah, I was up to something.

400
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:06,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was.

401
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,239
Speaker 0: You don't know what he was up to.

402
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,120
Speaker 1: No, but anyway, good.

403
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:18,820
Speaker 1: The point is, is that that's around the time it became sort of inconvenient to read webcomics because you had to check all these sites.

404
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:22,400
Speaker 0: And, you know, I was sort of a lot of the like RSS feeds kind of stuff working.

405
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,979
Speaker 1: I lost track of where I was.

406
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,780
Speaker 1: This is a website, Comic Rocket, that was trying to help solve the situation.

407
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:28,839
Speaker 1: But it was kind of janky.

408
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,980
Speaker 1: I don't know if it still exists.

409
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:30,998
Speaker 1: And it went down all the time.

410
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:37,859
Speaker 0: We're basically like I can list every webcomic where I go to the website religiously and read them like I read Dr.

411
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,238
Speaker 0: McNinja all the way to the end.

412
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,446
Speaker 0: And now I read what?

413
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,140
Speaker 0: Cucumber Quest, Order of the Stick.

414
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:44,140
Speaker 1: I read Cucumber Quest on paper.

415
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:45,639
Speaker 0: I just read the webcomic.

416
00:26:45,960 --> 00:27:00,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is that back in the day, right, people would get mad at webcomics for like not updating on schedule because you had to like manually go to these sites to see the new you to go to all these different websites to see the new comics.

417
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:06,740
Speaker 0: For my entire adult life, every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I would go to Penny Arcade in the morning and I'd read a Penny Arcade.

418
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,820
Speaker 1: I had bookmarks of every webcomic and I would open all the bookmarks in tabs and every morning go through each tab to see if there was a new one.

419
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,780
Speaker 0: I had a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday bookmark tab.

420
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,087
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

421
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,020
Speaker 0: Because Penny Arcade was Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

422
00:27:22,161 --> 00:27:22,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway.

423
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,239
Speaker 0: Megatokia was what, Tuesday, Thursday?

424
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:25,179
Speaker 0: I don't know.

425
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:25,821
Speaker 0: The

426
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:49,280
Speaker 1: point is, is that that became annoying in an era where you'd go to Twitter or whatever and things would come at you and you didn't have to, you know, you had Google Reader died, you know, and webcomics of that nature were always hesitant to even make RSS feeds or post their comics on Twitter because they depended business wise on the ad revenue of you visiting their website.

427
00:27:49,360 --> 00:28:02,240
Speaker 1: They made a JPEG, which could be easily shared around the whole Internet, and they wanted you to read that to see that JPEG only when it was inside of their HTML that also contained another JPEG that someone paid for.

428
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:14,617
Speaker 1: They didn't want you to see that JPEG on Imgur or Facebook or somewhere else where they wouldn't get anything from it, or especially not if someone like removed their, you know, name and URL from.

429
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,420
Speaker 1: that was written at the bottom of the JPEG.

430
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:17,161
Speaker 1: Right?

431
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:30,740
Speaker 1: And that was the webcomic business model, and because of that, fell off that webcomic bandwagon, not that I didn't want to keep reading them or I didn't like them, it just was inconvenient to read them, and once you fall off a little bit, to catch up is like,

432
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:30,940
Speaker 0: ugh.

433
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if it's not, like, even if it's not a serial.

434
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:40,480
Speaker 1: Like, I really want to read Order of the Stick, but for me to catch up on it is like how much, I have to sit there for like hours and read all the ones I missed.

435
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have no idea, it's good, it's good stuff.

436
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:43,336
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is.

437
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,820
Speaker 0: The plot has been revealed.

438
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:45,779
Speaker 1: I'm sure it is.

439
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,819
Speaker 0: Like, the full plot.

440
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,110
Speaker 0: Yep.

441
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:48,399
Speaker 0: I know what the snarl is.

442
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:55,500
Speaker 1: I know it, but, you know, I'd have to spend a lot of time and effort to catch up on it, and that's only one of the comics I'd have to catch up on.

443
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Speaker 0: Like, all the people were like, oh my god, you guys should watch Critical Role, like, yeah, that ship sailed, sorry.

444
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,420
Speaker 1: Right.

445
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:15,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what's happened I've noticed more recently is that even though I haven't been reading the webcomics, on my feeds, on various social networks, Instagrams, Twitters, even, you know, people are just posting full comics.

446
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:22,100
Speaker 1: And not other people sharing, like, you know, comics that they copied to JPEG and uploaded it, but no.

447
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,937
Speaker 0: Those are out there too.

448
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:34,880
Speaker 1: They are, but the actual creators, there are people making brand new comics and intentionally creating their JPEG with the knowledge that they, like, might even have a fucking website.

449
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:40,320
Speaker 1: Like, the primary place for this JPEG to be posted is their social media account.

450
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:46,780
Speaker 1: Like, the Instagram.com/whatever is the official site for that comic.

451
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:54,120
Speaker 0: Now, it sort of snuck up on me, like, I just was reading a bunch of comics, like, False Knees was the one where one day I was like, wait a minute, this is a webcomic.

452
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:54,656
Speaker 1: Yeah.

453
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:59,100
Speaker 0: But I've just been thinking of it as something that appears semi-regularly in my Twitter feed.

454
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,447
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

455
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:03,339
Speaker 0: And, like, suddenly we made the connection, like, oh, there's a bunch of these.

456
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,040
Speaker 0: Right, so people- We tried to list them all, and we're going to miss a bunch of them because- But the point is, is that this has become, like, obvious.

457
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,139
Speaker 1: Like, oh, if you want people to read your freaking comic, just post it on Twitter, everyone will follow you.

458
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,100
Speaker 1: Right?

459
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,140
Speaker 1: People will retweet you, you'll get really popular.

460
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:28,200
Speaker 1: Also- You put your name and URL and your info in the JPEG itself so that people know who the hell it was that made this thing, and you can still make fucking money off, you know, merchandising and the popularity.

461
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,200
Speaker 1: Like, it's working out.

462
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:38,100
Speaker 1: People who are making good comics and just directly to social media, things are working out for them, just like they worked out for webcomic creators back in the day.

463
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:42,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, so- They're publishing books of their comics and selling them.

464
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,618
Speaker 0: So the other thing about these comics- Paper kind.

465
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,428
Speaker 0: Is that they tend to not be serial.

466
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:51,600
Speaker 0: Like, they tend to be stand-alone, like, they're enjoyable stand-alone.

467
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,780
Speaker 1: There are some that are serial, but yes, even the serial ones tend to be enjoyable stand-alone.

468
00:30:56,141 --> 00:31:02,240
Speaker 1: And that's because you don't have that user interface of back and forward that a webcomic website has.

469
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:02,640
Speaker 1: Right?

470
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,840
Speaker 1: You have the- You know, any individual one might be tweeted or retweeted and must stand alone, you know, to get sort of propagated.

471
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,900
Speaker 1: Some people, like the very popular alien one, which is called- what's it actually called?

472
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,038
Speaker 0: I think Strange Planet?

473
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,320
Speaker 1: It's called Strange Planet.

474
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one.

475
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,784
Speaker 1: Right?

476
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:21,900
Speaker 1: He basically posts them all in, like, a Twitter thread.

477
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,456
Speaker 1: So, like, if you get it shared to one, then you can sort of see,

478
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:26,119
Speaker 1: "Oh!".

479
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,995
Speaker 1: And if you get back to the original that he posted somehow, you'll see the befores and afters because they're all in the same Twitter thread.

480
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,040
Speaker 1: He keeps replying to it.

481
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,040
Speaker 0: Now, I tried to find some of these I was thinking about because I was also trying to think about, was there an equivalent of this before, like, Twitter?

482
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:54,400
Speaker 0: And what I remembered was that there was this set of comics- when I was reading webcomics the way we just described, like the traditional old man way of my bookmarks- I got webcomics the old man way.

483
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,479
Speaker 0: Dude, I remember when there weren't that many webcomics.

484
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,880
Speaker 0: Like, the webcomics industry was, like, 30 webcomics.

485
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:10,866
Speaker 1: I probably could go back and catch up on webcomics, you know, if I had some time, because a lot of the ones I was into ended, so there aren't really that many- Yeah, like, Dr.

486
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:11,539
Speaker 0: Me Ninja's dumb.

487
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:12,787
Speaker 1: I can read Dr.

488
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:25,559
Speaker 1: Me Ninja to the end, I can catch up on Order of the Stick, I think there's some set of Penny Arcades I've missed, but the newer ones, they don't post the comic on Twitter, but they tweet, and in the tweet, they put a link to the comic, so I've-

489
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:28,380
Speaker 0: I still just go to Penny Arcade every Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

490
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,720
Speaker 1: I have to catch up and then get back in the habit, right?

491
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:33,040
Speaker 0: I'm still in that habit.

492
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, I lost the habit.

493
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,720
Speaker 0: The thing is, the number of comics I read for it with that habit has just slowly shrunk over time as comics I was already doing that way ended.

494
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:50,851
Speaker 1: Right, you look at someone like Kate Beaton, who basically stopped posting comics on her official comic site and stopped making it, and now, but she still will draw tiny comics and put them on Twitter.

495
00:32:51,500 --> 00:33:23,920
Speaker 0: Yup, but there was an equivalent of this during that era, and I realized that those were the comics, like, there were the webcomics that had their own websites, but there were a handful of comics that would be updated sporadically, they were usually standalone jokes that were in a theme, and they were posted to either Facebook or, like, LiveJournal directly, but because they were there, as opposed to on a website, I either wouldn't see them, or would find one and was unwilling to interact with LiveJournal or Facebook enough to find more of them, because there was no website.

496
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,780
Speaker 1: Right, but you know, if you were, say, there was a comic, say, on Tumblr, or on, you know- Still wasn't willing to, Tumblr comics were the same thing.

497
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:37,220
Speaker 1: Right, the point is, though, if you were a Tumblr user, that comic would appear in your feed much the way that these other comics appear in your Twitter feed.

498
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,980
Speaker 0: And the one I remembered, the earliest one I could think of, was I, Hearth, Darth.

499
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't remember this.

500
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:51,485
Speaker 0: Which I'm surprised you don't remember, and I tried to Google for it, and all I found was a Reddit thread from three years ago, where someone asked, "Does anyone remember the I, Hearth, Darth

501
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:51,914
Speaker 0: series?".

502
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:56,740
Speaker 0: And two people remembered it, and I ended up finding a link to it.

503
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:08,270
Speaker 0: It was from 2005, and it was basically this tiny little comic on LiveJournal that was just Darth Vader and a young Luke Skywalker, and it was just funny little comics of, like, "Darth is my

504
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:08,717
Speaker 0: dad.".

505
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:15,960
Speaker 1: Right, it's not the same comic as Darth Vader and Son, which is, like, a book- Though it is shockingly similar.

506
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:17,579
Speaker 0: Like, same jokes.

507
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,219
Speaker 0: I already found strips that are, like, the same strip, basically, but just drawn really cute and tiny.

508
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:34,639
Speaker 0: So Emily had the idea, and it was a really good idea, that we tried to come up with a list of a lot, as many of these that we read or thought of, that we know of and try to review them all and call them to your attention.

509
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:44,998
Speaker 1: It's, like, because, like, I just want to increase the consciousness, because the phase I went through was these comics were regularly appearing in my feeds, and I was noticing them and liking them.

510
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,351
Speaker 1: Yeah.

511
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:55,800
Speaker 1: But I wasn't, like, when one would appear, because someone else retweeted it, mostly, I would like it and/or retweet it, but I wasn't taking that extra step of recognizing, "Wait a minute.

512
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:57,939
Speaker 1: This is a comic that I like.

513
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:00,180
Speaker 1: Find the original account it's from.

514
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:01,019
Speaker 1: Follow it.

515
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,015
Speaker 1: Then you can see all of

516
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:02,158
Speaker 1: them.".

517
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,260
Speaker 1: So that's what I'm trying to do.

518
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,039
Speaker 1: That's the purpose of this.

519
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,856
Speaker 0: False Knees was the one where I realized, "Wait, this is just a

520
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,540
Speaker 0: webcomic.".

521
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:07,838
Speaker 0: Right.

522
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:12,876
Speaker 1: So the purpose of this episode is to spread that consciousness to anyone else who was lacking it.

523
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,960
Speaker 1: You know, you might laugh at us for lacking it, and you're right to do so, but other people might not, you know, grasp, right?

524
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,040
Speaker 1: They might not grok yet.

525
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:30,100
Speaker 1: It's, like, so we're gonna, like, make you aware so that when you see a funny comic on Twitter, you find the original account and follow it so you can read the whole thing.

526
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:35,860
Speaker 1: And also, we're gonna tell you a bunch of good ones and some okay ones in case you're looking for ones to follow.

527
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,420
Speaker 0: And you need to come to the Geek Nights Forum and post the ones that we forget to talk about.

528
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,660
Speaker 1: That's right, so I can follow them.

529
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:42,995
Speaker 1: Yes.

530
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:43,658
Speaker 1: All right.

531
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:44,660
Speaker 1: Let's just go down the list.

532
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,197
Speaker 1: So the first one is the one, it's called Webcomic Name, but everyone else knows it as Ohno.

533
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:49,838
Speaker 1: Yup.

534
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,460
Speaker 1: The Ohno comic where it follows the same formula of something something.

535
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,160
Speaker 0: It's like dinosaur comics, right?

536
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:59,260
Speaker 1: Panel one is always something something.

537
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,619
Speaker 1: And then panel two is always butt black dynamite something something.

538
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,839
Speaker 1: And then panel three is Ohno.

539
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,220
Speaker 0: It is never not funny.

540
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:08,419
Speaker 1: I love Ohno.

541
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,900
Speaker 1: It's caused a meme to infect me in that I now say Ohno way too much.

542
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:15,620
Speaker 1: I say Ohno all the time.

543
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,720
Speaker 1: In fact, there was an Ohno comic that was like, Ohno, I read this comic.

544
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,559
Speaker 1: It caused me to say Ohno all the time.

545
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:21,895
Speaker 1: Ohno.

546
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,674
Speaker 1: Ohno.

547
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:24,940
Speaker 1: Butt black dynamite.

548
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,939
Speaker 1: Now I say Ohno all the time.

549
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:27,079
Speaker 0: It's just Ohno.

550
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:43,738
Speaker 0: I think what's good about Ohno is that in its core, it is very cutting because we experience like I experience the exact situation like exactly in my brain that happens in these comics on a regular basis.

551
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:54,040
Speaker 1: They also there was a thing that was there was a tool that would randomly shuffle panels of Ohno comics and also let you create your own your own Ohno comic by combining panels.

552
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,080
Speaker 0: Similar to like Cyanide and Happiness's thing.

553
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:56,500
Speaker 1: Right.

554
00:36:57,201 --> 00:37:02,920
Speaker 1: And also today, Dinosaur Comics, the creator of Ohno made the dinosaur comic today.

555
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,840
Speaker 1: It is pretty much Ohno.

556
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:06,600
Speaker 0: I didn't even see that because I don't follow Dinosaur Comics anymore.

557
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:07,537
Speaker 1: I saw it on Twitter.

558
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,560
Speaker 1: I didn't see it.

559
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:09,197
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

560
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,640
Speaker 0: I got to follow them like Stan.

561
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,039
Speaker 1: Let me see if it is what it is.

562
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,552
Speaker 1: Click on it.

563
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:13,880
Speaker 0: Dinosaur.

564
00:37:14,004 --> 00:37:14,333
Speaker 0: There it is.

565
00:37:17,447 --> 00:37:17,939
Speaker 0: That's too good.

566
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,518
Speaker 1: It's just Dinosaur Comics, except Ohno, Ohno, Ohno, not Ohno, Ohno.

567
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:26,380
Speaker 0: I just imagine me as William Defoe standing here going, it was a reconstruction.

568
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:27,480
Speaker 0: Deconstruction.

569
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,240
Speaker 1: So yeah.

570
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,380
Speaker 1: Ohno webcomic name is it's webcomic name dot com.

571
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,520
Speaker 1: But you can you just follow it on Twitter instead.

572
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:35,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

573
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,320
Speaker 1: And then you'll see all the webcomic names, the Ohnos.

574
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,900
Speaker 0: So Big Brain.

575
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:41,879
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

576
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:42,407
Speaker 0: Yeah.

577
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,280
Speaker 1: So it's Bird Brain.

578
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:45,660
Speaker 1: Yeah.

579
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,695
Speaker 1: It's basically this pigeon who's got, you know, mental, you know, disabilities of some kind.

580
00:37:55,722 --> 00:38:01,240
Speaker 1: And all the comics involving the pigeon are totally cool.

581
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,159
Speaker 0: I'm scrolling through because there's a regular old.

582
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,590
Speaker 0: Yeah.

583
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,740
Speaker 1: Because that's the thing is like, this is just someone's Twitter account, right?

584
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,040
Speaker 1: It's an artist's Twitter account.

585
00:38:08,462 --> 00:38:14,659
Speaker 1: And it's like you're getting all the tweets from the artist, but then you're actually getting occasionally the artist will tweet the actual comic.

586
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,369
Speaker 0: Yup.

587
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,260
Speaker 1: Right.

588
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,580
Speaker 1: So here it's like the, you know, the bird, one bird is depressed and in the bubble on his phone or whatever.

589
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:23,460
Speaker 1: Right.

590
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:27,036
Speaker 1: And then the other bird's like, I know it's hard, but please try to talk about how you're feeling.

591
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,380
Speaker 0: And it's, it's good because again, it's sort of, it's funny, but it's also very true.

592
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:33,360
Speaker 0: Like that is what it's like to be depressed.

593
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,100
Speaker 0: And it's also well-drawn.

594
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,418
Speaker 0: The Twitter itself is good too.

595
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,900
Speaker 0: Really drawing a lot.

596
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,399
Speaker 1: Because someone who draws a good comic is probably someone who's a good person who's going to tweet good stuff.

597
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:45,359
Speaker 0: Really into knife movement right now.

598
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,160
Speaker 0: I see a lot of knife movement in this account.

599
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,779
Speaker 1: Love that knife movement.

600
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:49,460
Speaker 0: This is the best one I've seen.

601
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,545
Speaker 1: It's a, isn't it?

602
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,440
Speaker 1: like Chuck Draws Things, I think is the...

603
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,940
Speaker 0: Charleby, just Chuck and a bird and a snowflake.

604
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that it's called like Chuck Draws.

605
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,740
Speaker 0: Well, what do you, what is the name of a Twitter account?

606
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,961
Speaker 0: Is it the @?

607
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:06,000
Speaker 0: Is it the name they typed or is it that image there?

608
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,399
Speaker 0: Cause they're all three different things.

609
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,380
Speaker 1: Regardless, Chuck is the person who makes the great pigeon comic Bird Brain.

610
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,520
Speaker 1: I'm sure there might be other comics called Bird Brain.

611
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,077
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

612
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:18,338
Speaker 0: So I think Emily introduced me to this one.

613
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
Speaker 1: This one is the hottest thing in the world right now.

614
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:23,940
Speaker 1: Nathan W. Pyle's Strange Planet.

615
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:35,340
Speaker 1: You'll know it as the Alien comic where basically there's aliens doing normal everyday stuff, but he replaces the dialogue with, how do I describe the dialogue?

616
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:44,840
Speaker 0: Imagine if aliens were pretending to be humans for funsies and talking about it while they do it.

617
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:48,640
Speaker 0: I'm trying to find the one that best exemplifies this.

618
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:53,880
Speaker 0: There's the one where like they come over to the apartment and they're like, oh, people are coming over.

619
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,380
Speaker 0: Let us hide all the shapes that have all the irregular shapes inside of regular shapes.

620
00:39:58,402 --> 00:39:58,600
Speaker 0: Right.

621
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:16,020
Speaker 1: It's almost like if you're trying, if you were trying to like, you know, basically constantly play a game of taboo all the time to where every single sentence you said, the key subjects and predicates of that sentence were not permitted and you had to instead, you know, work your way around that.

622
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:23,900
Speaker 0: Aliens are like friends arriving soon and then the ones like, let us store irregular shapes inside shapes with flat surfaces.

623
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,320
Speaker 0: And then other aliens come in and they're like, your home is beautiful.

624
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:28,135
Speaker 0: Thank you.

625
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,579
Speaker 0: We do own things, but have hidden them.

626
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:31,380
Speaker 1: Yep.

627
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,760
Speaker 0: That is exactly what you do when someone's about to visit your apartment.

628
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,280
Speaker 1: That's right.

629
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,039
Speaker 1: I hide all my things inside.

630
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,639
Speaker 0: All my things are hidden inside of other flatter things.

631
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

632
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:49,579
Speaker 1: So it's like you get sort of this double, you know, the reason this comic is so popular and funny is because it does two things at once.

633
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:52,793
Speaker 1: It exposes a true human thing.

634
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:54,540
Speaker 1: Right.

635
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,140
Speaker 1: When people visit my house, I clean up by hiding things.

636
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,417
Speaker 1: Right.

637
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,419
Speaker 1: That's joke one.

638
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:07,320
Speaker 1: And joke two is rather than say, you know, just what it is like, yeah, let's quick, let's hide everything because someone's coming over.

639
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:14,519
Speaker 1: It plays that game of taboo with every sentence to use different words rather than the words that you normally use.

640
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,500
Speaker 0: The surprise party one instead of surprise.

641
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,237
Speaker 0: It's we deceived you.

642
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:18,992
Speaker 1: Right.

643
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:19,659
Speaker 1: Exactly.

644
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:21,660
Speaker 0: It's real funny.

645
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,980
Speaker 1: It's also most of these, not all of them, but most of them are for coma.

646
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:26,880
Speaker 1: Right.

647
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:27,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

648
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:27,720
Speaker 1: Right.

649
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:28,499
Speaker 1: In a square.

650
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,139
Speaker 1: Which is one of my favorite formats, which is a format that not only works super well in general, right?

651
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,898
Speaker 1: As the Japanese have proved, but also works just really well for sharing on social media in a square.

652
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,725
Speaker 1: I thought it's an Instagram or Twitter.

653
00:41:42,886 --> 00:41:49,480
Speaker 1: making JPEG a square just makes it work, you know, on all of these various platforms, right?

654
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:56,399
Speaker 1: Of social sharing, you know, whereas if you make like a rectangle or something tall, it gets cut off or you can't share it.

655
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,620
Speaker 1: The square is perfect.

656
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:00,719
Speaker 0: So, so awkward yeti.

657
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:07,856
Speaker 1: So this is the one where there's like a brain and a heart and it's like these parts of the body and they talk to each other, right?

658
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,095
Speaker 1: It's like the human is doing a thing, right?

659
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,120
Speaker 1: Clearly it's somewhat similar to actually in some ways to the strange planet, right?

660
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,850
Speaker 1: But it's like the characters are the brain, the

661
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,035
Speaker 0: tongue,

662
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:31,775
Speaker 1: the heart, the parts of the body, and they're sort of describing, you know, what's going on with them in relation to the thing the human who possesses them is actually doing something

663
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,600
Speaker 0: feels wrong and the brain's like quick scroll endlessly through social media.

664
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:36,398
Speaker 1: Yep.

665
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:41,080
Speaker 0: Like it's, it's a thing we all do again and they're cute and self-contained.

666
00:42:41,703 --> 00:42:44,560
Speaker 0: And I feel like a lot of these, all the ones we've talked about so far.

667
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:48,898
Speaker 0: They tend to be very similar in terms of like what it is.

668
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,580
Speaker 0: Like what is the topic they're dancing around?

669
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,959
Speaker 0: What is the topic they're using for their source material?

670
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:05,700
Speaker 1: So there's War and Peas, which actually was so, War and Peas is so good that I, I became, this one, I became a Patreon patron.

671
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,900
Speaker 1: This is the one that occasionally features the slutty witch who just owns being a slutty witch and is like, yeah, I'm a slutty witch.

672
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,316
Speaker 0: What up?

673
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:23,439
Speaker 0: It gives me like a slight PBF vibe, but more comicky and less like, PBF is a little bit weird, a little bit different from this, but it gives me a slight hint of that.

674
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,204
Speaker 1: Yeah.

675
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:32,720
Speaker 1: This one, you know, it has that kind of, you know, it's, I think what's funny about this comic is like the edginess of it, right?

676
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:32,971
Speaker 1: A bit.

677
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,800
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, edgy, like trying to be cool and edgy, right?

678
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,580
Speaker 1: Like, you know, dark on purpose, like dark Batman edgy or being violent on purpose.

679
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:43,480
Speaker 1: Right.

680
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:54,820
Speaker 1: But it like, it travels into, you know, uh, you know, sort of, you know, sexy and other other topics in ways that are humorous without being crazy.

681
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:57,480
Speaker 1: Sort of like, I'll go off a little bit without being explicit.

682
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:58,318
Speaker 0: Like I love it.

683
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:06,259
Speaker 0: But also like PBF, like sometimes the joke is a callous act or a horrible cruelty occurs in the last or second to last panel.

684
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:10,239
Speaker 0: But, uh, some like the one, cause I'm just scrolling through here.

685
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,560
Speaker 0: Like you want to talk about a real one is a vampire.

686
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,999
Speaker 0: Just like, can't wait to come home.

687
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:15,220
Speaker 0: And then he's home.

688
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,357
Speaker 0: Can't wait to watch TV.

689
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:17,758
Speaker 0: Now he's watching TV.

690
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,179
Speaker 0: He can't wait to go to sleep.

691
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,620
Speaker 0: And then you see the coffin and he's just like, I can't wait to do this again.

692
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,060
Speaker 1: Right.

693
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,023
Speaker 1: So he's making.

694
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:31,417
Speaker 1: the one joke that's being made is obviously about, you know, the pointlessness of, of, you know, life, uh, right.

695
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:38,449
Speaker 1: Just going to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, the old Simpsons joke, but also it's fun making a vampire do.

696
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,520
Speaker 1: it suddenly makes it right on another level.

697
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:43,460
Speaker 1: And then the third level is vampires are immortal.

698
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:45,019
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

699
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,469
Speaker 1: Yeah.

700
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:46,000
Speaker 1: Right.

701
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,578
Speaker 1: That's the, it's at the three level joke.

702
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:55,719
Speaker 1: I think there's one where like someone invites, uh, there's like a, a, a slutty witch and he, and it's like, come back to my place.

703
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,240
Speaker 1: The slutty witch is like, I'm not wearing any underwear.

704
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,959
Speaker 1: So he's like, come back to my place.

705
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:01,580
Speaker 1: So you don't get a cold.

706
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:08,740
Speaker 1: And then it shows the slutty witch back at his place on the couch with a blanket and he's bringing some tea and she's watching television.

707
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,379
Speaker 1: She watching like be witched on television, just taking care of her being nice.

708
00:45:13,123 --> 00:45:14,359
Speaker 0: Like not being a bad dude.

709
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,056
Speaker 0: It's the wholesome ending where Netflix and chill literally means let's just watch the Netflix.

710
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,535
Speaker 1: Yup.

711
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:19,377
Speaker 1: Yup.

712
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:20,639
Speaker 0: I like it.

713
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:26,519
Speaker 0: It's, it's, uh, I like warm peas a lot, especially because it, uh, appears more readily than a Perry Bible fellowship.

714
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:27,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

715
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,060
Speaker 1: I mean, Perry velvet, he's, he's a little active.

716
00:45:29,924 --> 00:45:31,139
Speaker 0: He's been more active recently.

717
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:32,980
Speaker 0: Poorly drawn lines.

718
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:35,619
Speaker 0: I've been laughing at reliably for a while now.

719
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:37,920
Speaker 0: They're longer form comics usually.

720
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:38,597
Speaker 1: Usually.

721
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:39,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

722
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,319
Speaker 0: And they tend to have a more absurdist punchline.

723
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:48,440
Speaker 0: Like they're much more absurd or indirect than, uh, like some of them are like, some of them just don't end like just nothing happens.

724
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:49,619
Speaker 0: And that's the joke.

725
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,060
Speaker 1: And it's, they're not poorly.

726
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:57,139
Speaker 1: It says poorly drawn lines of the name of the comic, but I don't think they're poorly drawn, but they are definitely just not a lot of lines.

727
00:45:57,782 --> 00:45:59,819
Speaker 1: And then sort of the coloring is just bucket tool.

728
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:00,519
Speaker 0: Yup.

729
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:00,860
Speaker 1: Right?

730
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,340
Speaker 1: It's like the bird is just blue.

731
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,699
Speaker 1: The koala is just gray.

732
00:46:04,249 --> 00:46:04,439
Speaker 0: Yup.

733
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,480
Speaker 0: They make really good faces despite being so simple.

734
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,868
Speaker 0: Kind of like how XKCD just, even though they're stick figures, they emote like in a subtle way, like.

735
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,979
Speaker 0: that makes it work.

736
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:19,419
Speaker 0: They make like the bird will sometimes like have this open beak face where he's clearly being dumb about something.

737
00:46:19,962 --> 00:46:21,299
Speaker 1: I've been saving money for three years.

738
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:21,955
Speaker 1: Here it is.

739
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,519
Speaker 0: I got this money three years ago.

740
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,635
Speaker 1: Money I got three years ago.

741
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,020
Speaker 0: And he's making that slightly open mouth face.

742
00:46:27,302 --> 00:46:29,500
Speaker 0: That reminds me of the Morty face in Rick and Morty.

743
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:32,340
Speaker 0: All right.

744
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,079
Speaker 0: Let's just keep, we had a lot.

745
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,460
Speaker 0: Let's just keep going down the line.

746
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,480
Speaker 1: So this extra fabulous comics, this one, I don't know if I can really recommend this one, right?

747
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:41,560
Speaker 1: So this has like a huge warning on it, right?

748
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,320
Speaker 1: But, but basically I went through my Twitter likes and I noticed that I had like.

749
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:48,860
Speaker 1: this is the one reason I can't recommend the one.

750
00:46:50,782 --> 00:46:54,860
Speaker 1: So I had liked at least three strips from this same comic, right?

751
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:55,320
Speaker 1: Scroll down.

752
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,778
Speaker 1: There's like a Jesus one that I really like.

753
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:59,036
Speaker 0: Right.

754
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:01,900
Speaker 1: It's like, so this one's hit or miss.

755
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:15,960
Speaker 1: And it's like, I get a vague feeling the person who makes this comic, it's like, I don't know if they're a bad person, but a lot of the comics sort of go into very uncomfortable territory or make jokes that are not funny.

756
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,360
Speaker 1: Like the newest one is like, literally it's a suicide joke where Ash takes Pikachu in the bathtub.

757
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,719
Speaker 1: It is not funny.

758
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,939
Speaker 1: I found it like really disturbing, not into it at all.

759
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,719
Speaker 0: Then the bonus panel was basically it didn't work.

760
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:29,372
Speaker 1: Right.

761
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:29,853
Speaker 1: Sort of.

762
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:36,199
Speaker 1: But there's another comic made by the same person where it's like, okay, these kids are like, quick, hide the porn.

763
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,139
Speaker 1: Jesus is coming.

764
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:37,537
Speaker 1: Yeah.

765
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:46,340
Speaker 1: And then Jesus comes and then gives them a spanking and it's like, Jesus is so mad about porn, but he's also into spanking, right?

766
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:46,716
Speaker 0: Yup.

767
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,158
Speaker 0: Of course.

768
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:54,719
Speaker 0: The one you just talked about, the thing is, it reminds me of the kind of joke that would be every single parking lot is full.

769
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,380
Speaker 0: Like every parking lot in full was a joke.

770
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,119
Speaker 0: Parking lot is full was a joke like that.

771
00:47:59,367 --> 00:47:59,557
Speaker 0: Yeah.

772
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,880
Speaker 0: And that comic was disturbing, but I did also enjoy it.

773
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,120
Speaker 1: So even though some of these are not funny and not disturbing, none of them are offensive.

774
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,580
Speaker 1: They're not Nazi jokes.

775
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:09,440
Speaker 0: They're not just like racist.

776
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:09,880
Speaker 1: Right.

777
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,999
Speaker 1: They're not racist or anything, at least none that I've seen.

778
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:12,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

779
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:17,958
Speaker 1: So I recommend this one with major qualifications that some are, it's all over the place.

780
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,180
Speaker 0: The Harry Potter one is really gross, but I laughed out loud.

781
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:21,736
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

782
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:22,155
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

783
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:30,059
Speaker 0: Because panel one, I laughed out loud and I didn't like, and I was surprised that it got grosser and somehow both grosser and funnier.

784
00:48:31,724 --> 00:48:33,038
Speaker 0: It's a lot of panels in that one.

785
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,533
Speaker 1: Yup.

786
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,380
Speaker 0: A nice long, nope.

787
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,159
Speaker 0: I skipped one.

788
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,075
Speaker 0: No, I didn't.

789
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,237
Speaker 0: A nice long walk.

790
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,200
Speaker 1: I forget.

791
00:48:40,662 --> 00:48:44,420
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing is when you're not going to a website, right?

792
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:53,680
Speaker 1: For, Oh, so when you're not going to a website and you just see the comic, when it appears in your feed, you might not like know the name of the comic.

793
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:57,568
Speaker 1: If you're just like, you only see the name of the person or you only saw someone retweeted it.

794
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,420
Speaker 0: So you see your friend's name and I liked a lot of these comics.

795
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,120
Speaker 0: They remind me vaguely of like the kind of joke, like a Natasha Allegory thing would make.

796
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,960
Speaker 1: So this is an exception in that it's, it's sometimes there's episodes, right?

797
00:49:10,741 --> 00:49:19,539
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's just like individual comics, but there is a serial comic, a nice long walk about this girl who lives in a fantasy village and goes on a walk.

798
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:32,180
Speaker 1: Like, yep, I'm going to go on an adventure now by town and you can read it from the beginning and it's just super wholesome, super cute, you know, leaving town, going on an adventure as wholesome as possible, right?

799
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,397
Speaker 1: And there's all sorts of cute creatures.

800
00:49:35,161 --> 00:49:41,739
Speaker 1: He meets like a little friend on the way, you know, it's like even cuter than cucumber quest, even more wholesome and simple.

801
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,009
Speaker 0: Yep.

802
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,878
Speaker 0: Looks like a lot of the rest of the Twitter is just like pictures of birds, which is also really good.

803
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,233
Speaker 0: Yep.

804
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,760
Speaker 1: That's the thing is you're getting the, you get the artist and the art together.

805
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,440
Speaker 1: You can't, they're not like making a feed just for their comic.

806
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,678
Speaker 0: It's like, this is exactly the kind of reason why I use Twitter, but you just get rid of the Nazis.

807
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,839
Speaker 0: Twitter would be perfect.

808
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:00,239
Speaker 1: Yep.

809
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,740
Speaker 0: Get rid of the Nazis and charge like a dollar a year to get rid of the spam accounts.

810
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:05,220
Speaker 0: All right.

811
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,300
Speaker 1: So be everything at once is actually sort of a autobiographical situation.

812
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:15,380
Speaker 1: There's a person named Demi Lee is Korean American person.

813
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:19,879
Speaker 1: I actually bought her book on the paper version and read all the comics in it.

814
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:23,880
Speaker 1: And all the comics are about her real experience.

815
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:34,340
Speaker 1: You know, as someone who's lived in, you know, New York, I guess New York, but the United States and Korea, right back and forth at various times.

816
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:39,800
Speaker 1: You know, so there's jokes about like, you know, Oh my God, people like, Whoa, where's your fashion?

817
00:50:39,941 --> 00:50:41,598
Speaker 1: She's like, I bought these clothes in Korea.

818
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:41,883
Speaker 1: Ooh.

819
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:44,239
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, stuff like that.

820
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:46,179
Speaker 1: You know, language jokes.

821
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:52,278
Speaker 1: If you've ever seen the girl with the, you'll know the comics because she always draws herself wearing a sweatshirt with an egg on it.

822
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:52,632
Speaker 0: Yep.

823
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:54,839
Speaker 1: Those are the ones.

824
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,459
Speaker 0: I kind of want that sweatshirt.

825
00:50:57,465 --> 00:50:58,139
Speaker 1: Maybe she sells it.

826
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,938
Speaker 0: I bet she does.

827
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,539
Speaker 0: If she doesn't, someone should sell it.

828
00:51:01,304 --> 00:51:02,799
Speaker 1: Her book, I think, sold well, at least.

829
00:51:03,108 --> 00:51:03,317
Speaker 1: Yeah.

830
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,276
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm way, I'm way into it.

831
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,679
Speaker 0: All right.

832
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,179
Speaker 0: Pigeon Gazette.

833
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:10,258
Speaker 1: Trying to remember which one.

834
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,539
Speaker 0: I'm trying to remember.

835
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:14,188
Speaker 1: Oh, this is also.

836
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:15,960
Speaker 1: a lot of these are this one.

837
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,520
Speaker 0: I think I've liked because I've seen Overwatch jokes in here.

838
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,940
Speaker 0: Kind of this is the Overwatch.

839
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,019
Speaker 0: It's all a little cute.

840
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:21,758
Speaker 0: Overwatch jokes.

841
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,134
Speaker 1: Yes.

842
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:32,780
Speaker 1: This person does Genji cat Overwatch jokes and also does again, sort of like, you know, self care, uh, you know, mental health comics as well.

843
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,980
Speaker 0: A lot of these have that because I got one that I only knew it as self care wolf.

844
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,952
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's even a comic, but there's just this one comic someone tweeted once.

845
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:46,560
Speaker 0: This one is like, this is more just like a cute account to follow.

846
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah.

847
00:51:47,381 --> 00:51:48,216
Speaker 0: Which a lot of these are.

848
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:49,939
Speaker 0: All right.

849
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:58,119
Speaker 0: So this is a newspaper comic, but Nancy, the newspaper comic just tweets every comic, at least a lot of the comics.

850
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:05,340
Speaker 0: And if you're not aware, Nancy, the comic has sort of been reborn, right?

851
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:10,280
Speaker 1: So way back in the day, it was like an old, it was like, you know, early 20th century, right?

852
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,080
Speaker 1: Uh, Nancy was a thing and Nancy was really funny, right?

853
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,019
Speaker 1: But Nancy, right.

854
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,980
Speaker 1: But the new Nancy is basically the same character design, but completely different content.

855
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,519
Speaker 0: It's modern in a way that actually really confuses baby boomers who encounter it.

856
00:52:25,745 --> 00:52:25,875
Speaker 0: Yeah.

857
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,400
Speaker 0: To the point that that is itself part of the humor.

858
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:34,198
Speaker 0: Cause it's very just like, it's what newspaper comics would be today if newspapers still existed.

859
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:49,530
Speaker 1: It's like, it's, it's like a museum level, like work of art, what has been done, you know, with this somehow getting a license to the thing and then changing the thing in such a way as like, Oh, it's, you know, there's so many levels going on with Nancy, but yeah.

860
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,092
Speaker 0: Yup.

861
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,399
Speaker 0: The funniest thing about it is that I realized I wasn't actually following the official Twitter account.

862
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:56,300
Speaker 0: I was following this other Twitter account.

863
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,779
Speaker 0: That's just called Sluggo is lit.

864
00:52:58,201 --> 00:53:00,879
Speaker 0: That's just reposts the Nancy comics as far as I can tell.

865
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:02,300
Speaker 0: I don't think it's even legit.

866
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,340
Speaker 0: So I just switched to the right one, but no, Nancy is crazy funny.

867
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:06,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

868
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:08,460
Speaker 0: So false knees.

869
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:15,260
Speaker 0: This is the one that made me realize that this is a thing, these Twitter comics, it's just really well drawn animals.

870
00:53:15,784 --> 00:53:16,419
Speaker 1: Like, wow.

871
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,740
Speaker 1: Like someone's putting a lot of work into the art on this comic, like damn son.

872
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,480
Speaker 0: And these really well drawn animals.

873
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:30,338
Speaker 0: Audubon society shit are having the kinds of conversations you would imagine these kinds of animals have.

874
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:35,540
Speaker 0: If there isn't, if they're as intelligent as us, but otherwise just live like animals.

875
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,360
Speaker 1: So it's like, these are these birds.

876
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,599
Speaker 1: This is the thing that those birds do, but they speak English.

877
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:39,956
Speaker 0: Yup.

878
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:49,420
Speaker 0: The humor is really understated and really low key and really, really like, I cannot express to you how much I like this.

879
00:53:49,702 --> 00:53:51,820
Speaker 1: It reminds me, what was that guy's name?

880
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:57,148
Speaker 1: The comedian who would just, he would say everything super dead pan and even, and then he died.

881
00:53:58,824 --> 00:53:59,357
Speaker 0: Was one of them.

882
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:00,340
Speaker 1: No, he died.

883
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,980
Speaker 1: He was on, um, was it Mitch Hedberg?

884
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,560
Speaker 0: Is that the guy also did that?

885
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,640
Speaker 1: This is a lot like that kind of humor.

886
00:54:06,861 --> 00:54:09,059
Speaker 1: Only birds that are well drawn.

887
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:14,356
Speaker 0: Like just read it and you'll see, this is one of my favorite and it's, it's often just wholesome.

888
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:20,700
Speaker 0: Like my, my favorite strip they ever did is just a bird is like a little, little sparrow looking bird just picking up little flowers.

889
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:25,859
Speaker 0: And some other birds like, well, someone's a lucky bird and the birds like, Hey, yes, they are.

890
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:36,660
Speaker 1: I mean, this goes to a larger point in that I heard from someone like way back years and years ago, they were talking about like the cycles of cynicism and sincerity in society.

891
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,763
Speaker 1: Yup.

892
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:40,978
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, at the time I was like, wow, everything's super cynical.

893
00:54:41,018 --> 00:54:42,400
Speaker 1: right now is sincerity coming.

894
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:44,080
Speaker 1: And I feel like sincerity is now here.

895
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:44,900
Speaker 0: I think it's coming.

896
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:45,293
Speaker 1: Right.

897
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:58,239
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, you know, so that's why, you know, the, I think about like, oh, the comics that I was reading before, and I still read web comics were mostly cynical and all these ones on Twitter, they got all the retweets are super sincere and honest.

898
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,500
Speaker 0: So yeah, false knees might so far be my favorite of everything we've talked about.

899
00:55:05,608 --> 00:55:06,400
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not my alley.

900
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,480
Speaker 0: So this one is on the line.

901
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:22,380
Speaker 0: I don't think it actually counts, but I'll list it because there's a lot of, there's a bunch of Twitter accounts that are taking panels from other people's web comics or even their own web comic in some cases.

902
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,120
Speaker 0: And just tweeting like one panel out of context.

903
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,980
Speaker 1: I think this really all started with that Garfield thing.

904
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:29,534
Speaker 0: Yeah.

905
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,739
Speaker 0: Which was really funny.

906
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:31,160
Speaker 1: Yup.

907
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,980
Speaker 0: And I re I follow this like it's a web comic.

908
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,040
Speaker 0: It's no context.

909
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:36,480
Speaker 0: Aikwood.

910
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,800
Speaker 0: I've read a bunch of Aikwood.

911
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:38,679
Speaker 0: I kind of like Aikwood.

912
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,600
Speaker 0: Like it's pretty good comic.

913
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,640
Speaker 1: I read it whenever there's a link to it or somebody ever like read it all on purpose.

914
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:54,160
Speaker 0: But I like this more than I like Aikwood because in a vacuum, it's just like a couple of panels from one strip that are in and of themselves.

915
00:55:54,781 --> 00:56:02,319
Speaker 0: Really funny, but also kind of fucked up, but in a kind of sincere way based on these characters.

916
00:56:03,123 --> 00:56:05,660
Speaker 0: So it's like on the line of, is it a Twitter comic?

917
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:09,340
Speaker 0: Cause it's almost a remix of Aikwood, but they're not remixing.

918
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,369
Speaker 0: They're just zooming in on one part of it.

919
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,840
Speaker 0: that ends up being really funny by itself.

920
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:14,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

921
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:23,020
Speaker 1: It's super interesting how you can take, you know, a portion of a work of art, not edit it other than to remove the rest of the art and then display it on its own.

922
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:29,259
Speaker 0: And it completely transformed into something else like Garfield without Garfield is one of the is like is a triumph of artistic expression.

923
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,300
Speaker 1: You could like take Star Wars and cut out like five seconds.

924
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:38,000
Speaker 1: And what in what if you were watching the movie and got to those five seconds, you would feel one feeling.

925
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:45,080
Speaker 1: But if I were to just show you out of nowhere, the clip of just those five seconds on their own, you have a complete opposite feeling.

926
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:45,438
Speaker 0: Yup.

927
00:56:45,826 --> 00:56:46,040
Speaker 1: Right.

928
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:47,719
Speaker 1: And that's sort of what happens here.

929
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:58,860
Speaker 1: And it's like, are you like, how much of an artist are you if you are simply recognizing and, and you know, you're just like an editor, but you're sort of not anyway.

930
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:10,838
Speaker 0: Well, like the people who will make a very well-crafted animated gif of a tiny part of movie that ends up itself having a life above and beyond the movie itself like that happens kind of often now.

931
00:57:11,988 --> 00:57:12,180
Speaker 0: All right.

932
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:12,959
Speaker 0: We only got three more.

933
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,807
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure there's a lot.

934
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:17,900
Speaker 0: we've forgotten that we'll remember the second I stop recording.

935
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,098
Speaker 1: So this is rest the shark.

936
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,119
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

937
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,940
Speaker 1: Rest the shark is pretty much just a ridiculously cute shark.

938
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:25,278
Speaker 1: That's all there is to it.

939
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,654
Speaker 1: The comic there are a lot of right.

940
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,540
Speaker 1: A lot of the Twitter posts and content are just images.

941
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:36,820
Speaker 1: And when there are comics, there usually aren't a lot of words on them because it's a shark.

942
00:57:37,863 --> 00:57:39,600
Speaker 1: The shark, for some reason, doesn't need to be in the ocean.

943
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:40,380
Speaker 1: It can go on land.

944
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,559
Speaker 0: It's basically a shark shaped dog.

945
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,231
Speaker 1: Right.

946
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:48,640
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's a, yeah, but it's not shaped exactly like a shark, but it's a shark.

947
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:49,179
Speaker 0: Yup.

948
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:55,200
Speaker 1: And it's just literally just like silently watching the cute shark do cute stuff.

949
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,578
Speaker 1: They sell cute merch.

950
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:59,079
Speaker 1: It's sort of like almost trying to be a Pusheen.

951
00:57:59,281 --> 00:58:01,840
Speaker 1: Only there is a comic with occasional strips.

952
00:58:02,324 --> 00:58:03,940
Speaker 1: Isn't really an official Pusheen comic.

953
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,880
Speaker 1: So this is like a Pusheen competitor.

954
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:07,098
Speaker 1: You know, rest the shark.

955
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely Pusheen adjacent.

956
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,294
Speaker 0: Yeah.

957
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,140
Speaker 0: Pockets.

958
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,950
Speaker 0: So Pockets is.

959
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,478
Speaker 1: I've seen this.

960
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:13,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

961
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,240
Speaker 0: So I've seen this comic.

962
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,998
Speaker 0: You'll see this Twitter account because a lot of times you'll see a wolf with a really, really long mouth.

963
00:58:20,904 --> 00:58:21,618
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't seen this.

964
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:21,980
Speaker 0: Yes.

965
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:33,260
Speaker 0: So it's cute and it has a lot of comics, but the one that really stood out that made me like this account is just this self-care dog comic where there's a dog in bed.

966
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,094
Speaker 0: It's like, you've been laying in bed for 17 hours, man.

967
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:36,439
Speaker 0: You good?

968
00:58:36,961 --> 00:58:40,000
Speaker 0: And the dog's like, I'm having a self-care day.

969
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,779
Speaker 0: Like bring me 12 pillows and a chocolate croissant.

970
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:44,579
Speaker 0: And that's the thing people who get depressed do.

971
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:48,980
Speaker 0: But then the next strip is like dogs out of bed doing shit.

972
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,539
Speaker 0: And the person is like, yo dude, you doing okay?

973
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:52,500
Speaker 0: I haven't seen you take a self-care day in a while.

974
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,100
Speaker 0: And it's like, yeah, turns out staying in bed for days wasn't actually self-care.

975
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:59,140
Speaker 0: Turns out I was super depressed, like clinically.

976
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:06,959
Speaker 0: And it's one of those comics that addresses depression and mental health issues in a funny but real way.

977
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:18,220
Speaker 1: Why are all the, it seems like a lot of people who, I assume the people making these comics have these issues, which is why they're able to, or they have friends who have these issues, which is why they're able to address them in comic form so well.

978
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:23,439
Speaker 1: Why are those people so creative and so good right now?

979
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:26,080
Speaker 1: There's like, it's clearly a sign of the times.

980
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:33,740
Speaker 0: I think part of it is that a lot of people are way more willing to talk about mental health and a lot of people are sharing things like this.

981
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:40,820
Speaker 1: It was a topic that was not previously explored in, you know, publicly shared art as much.

982
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:42,320
Speaker 0: I mean, dude, in public art.

983
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:52,020
Speaker 1: In this way, there's plenty of art about depression going back to the beginning of time, but like specifically in the modern context of it, right?

984
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:55,760
Speaker 0: People are just being open about this stuff and you see this as the result.

985
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,439
Speaker 0: I think it's great.

986
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,680
Speaker 0: Do we have any, I think I have one more on the list.

987
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,360
Speaker 0: Nerd and Jock.

988
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:01,100
Speaker 1: All right.

989
01:00:01,382 --> 01:00:02,819
Speaker 1: So you may have seen this one.

990
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:06,959
Speaker 1: It's actually, the account has other comics besides Nerd and Jock.

991
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,460
Speaker 1: It's like, but Nerd and Jock is definitely the best thing on this channel.

992
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,080
Speaker 0: Because it's very wholesome.

993
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,820
Speaker 1: It's again, another example of wholesome sincerity instead of cynicism.

994
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,400
Speaker 1: It's basically a nerd, this little tiny character with big glasses, stereotypical.

995
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:23,780
Speaker 1: And a jock, this huge muscly dude.

996
01:00:24,422 --> 01:00:26,780
Speaker 1: And they interact with each other, right?

997
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:34,380
Speaker 1: In a typical high school setting, except the jock does not pick on the nerd in the way you would expect.

998
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,420
Speaker 0: And the nerd does not like look down on or denigrate the jock.

999
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, the nerd isn't like, oh, you dumb jock, right?

1000
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,799
Speaker 1: It's like, they totally, you know, are cool to each other.

1001
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:43,580
Speaker 1: Right.

1002
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:45,160
Speaker 1: And it's pretty awesome.

1003
01:00:45,652 --> 01:00:45,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1004
01:00:45,941 --> 01:00:47,178
Speaker 0: It's just cute, wholesome.

1005
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:54,200
Speaker 1: Sometimes some of the jokes are like setups making you think someone's about to get picked on or whatever.

1006
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:55,699
Speaker 1: And then not.

1007
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:57,680
Speaker 1: It's like, that's sort of what the funny.

1008
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:00,779
Speaker 0: The end is always like, yo, bro, I will help you with that.

1009
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:01,238
Speaker 1: Yep.

1010
01:01:01,621 --> 01:01:05,260
Speaker 1: Instead of, you know, it's like, oh no, this strong jock is going to beat up that weak nerd.

1011
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,500
Speaker 1: Oh no, he helped him with his strength.

1012
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:08,960
Speaker 1: You know, awesome.

1013
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:09,432
Speaker 0: Yup.

1014
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:12,479
Speaker 0: So I'm sure there's a million of these we miss.

1015
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,236
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1016
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,100
Speaker 1: Send us all your new web comics that are primarily on social media instead of hiding on websites.

1017
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:26,835
Speaker 0: I'm going to post all the ones we talked about in the forum, and then I expect you to post literally all the ones that we're going to remember the second I hit.

1018
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:27,780
Speaker 0: stop on this stream.

1019
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:35,300
Speaker 1: And then we can all go to Twitter, Instagram, wherever it is and follow all of them so that you don't miss any and only see them when someone else retweets them.

1020
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:35,712
Speaker 0: Yup.

1021
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,040
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1022
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:49,159

1030
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:23,659
Speaker 0: Now I leave you with... Oh my God, you're moving my mouse.

1031
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:24,779
Speaker 0: It's remote desktop.

1032
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,040
Speaker 0: What is your password?

1033
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,440
Speaker 0: Uh, it's just the letter A. Just the letter A, alright.

1034
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:31,077
Speaker 1: Like Apple.

1035
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,759
Speaker 0: Are you looking at my desktop right now?

1036
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,920
Speaker 0: Dude, how many programs do you have running?

1037
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:37,579
Speaker 0: You're totally overloading your box.

1038
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,980
Speaker 0: That's probably part of the reason.

1039
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,300
Speaker 0: Well, I use all these programs.

1040
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:41,880
Speaker 0: You know, I got a lot of work to do during the day.

1041
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,254
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa!

1042
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:43,057
Speaker 0: Hey, no, no, no!

1043
01:03:43,603 --> 01:03:44,299
Speaker 0: Can you save it?

1044
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:45,560
Speaker 0: No, no, I need to save this!

1045
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:45,691
Speaker 0: Shit.

1046
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:46,678
Speaker 1: This is all my work!

1047
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:48,279
Speaker 0: Look, you don't need this stuff.

1048
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:49,759
Speaker 0: I have some research that I'm doing, okay?

1049
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,479
Speaker 0: You can't close all my windows, okay?

1050
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,539
Speaker 0: I'm closing in on that.

1051
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:56,080
Speaker 0: Don't use AOL.

1052
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,137
Speaker 0: It's Dial-Up Networking.

1053
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,320
Speaker 0: Well, how am I going to get through the internet without AOL?

1054
01:04:00,707 --> 01:04:01,180
Speaker 0: It's broadband.

1055
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:02,590
Speaker 0: But I got like $4,000 for free.

1056
01:04:04,784 --> 01:04:05,495
Speaker 0: We have a corporate OC3.

1057
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:07,939
Speaker 0: It costs like $1,000 a month, so don't use AOL.

1058
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:08,611
Speaker 0: Whoa.
