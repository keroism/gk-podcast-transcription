1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,400
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday June 27th 2023.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,386
Speaker 1: I'm rim Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:18,795
Speaker 1: We are talking about worker placements the game mechanic.

4
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:20,539
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:26,328
Speaker 0: So today I was just thinking random thoughts Like you do like me.

6
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:28,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like, hey, you know what?

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,812
Speaker 0: You know, there's a. there's an animal called a an anteater, right?

8
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we know we've seen anteaters, right?

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,590
Speaker 0: They get a long snooty and they get their long tongue.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,180
Speaker 0: that comes out and they stick it down the hole where the ants live And they ant the ante Hill and they eat all the ants.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,276
Speaker 1: There's a lot of other animals that he dance, but they're not called anteaters.

12
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:45,900
Speaker 1: They are.

13
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's also anteaters.

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,414
Speaker 0: We call the anteater an anteater.

15
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:51,537
Speaker 0: It eats ants a lot.

16
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:52,500
Speaker 0: It's like a favorite food.

17
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,329
Speaker 0: It didn't get its name for no reason.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,515
Speaker 1: We got other animals like that.

19
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:56,460
Speaker 1: There's all the egg snakes.

20
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,488
Speaker 0: Sure, but I'm talking about anteaters here.

21
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:01,760
Speaker 0: an anteater is specially equipped for ants, right?

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,213
Speaker 0: It's like got a built-in ant hill eating mechanism.

23
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:21,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and I was thinking you know What if an anteater goes to eat ants but they turn out to be like those fucking nasty-ass fire ants who are like all You know bitey bitey Is he gonna get bit all on the tongue and or like get ants all over its face and get and get bit up by?

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,451
Speaker 0: The ants, you know, who's gonna?

25
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:24,497
Speaker 0: who's gonna win that fight?

26
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:31,440
Speaker 1: this, you know Covered with thousands of tiny hooks which are to hold the insects in place covered with a large amount of saliva.

27
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:42,768
Speaker 0: but so I did a little research and apparently I am NOT the first person far from the first person to have this question of anteater verse Fire ant who wins right?

28
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,880
Speaker 1: I started googling it as soon as I realized what you were asking.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,570
Speaker 0: So I was curious to save you to save you a Google.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,015
Speaker 0: Here's the answer right?

31
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,520
Speaker 0: Is that the fire ant?

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,640
Speaker 0: I mean the anteater doesn't really have a special tool.

33
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:58,725
Speaker 0: Like if it gets bit by fire ants it still fucking hurts Right, but he has.

34
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:01,234
Speaker 0: the only special tool it has is his fur.

35
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:06,080
Speaker 0: if the ants get on the fur It'll take them a little while to get down to the skin and start biting.

36
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:13,320
Speaker 0: I guess it could get bit on the tongue But I guess he could eat those and kill them pretty quick by sucking him in suck him into the desert, right?

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,706
Speaker 0: But the main technique the anteater has for dealing with nasty ants instead of regular old Ants know is he just doesn't see.

38
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:29,132
Speaker 0: he goes in he starts eating ants real quick before they notice and when they realize when the ants Realize what's happening and they get into bite mode.

39
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:29,736
Speaker 0: He runs away.

40
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,464
Speaker 1: Ah Smart anteater.

41
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,680
Speaker 0: He just goes in and he's like, you know, ooh fire ants, huh?

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,269
Speaker 0: Well, you can't just sit around a feast.

43
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:40,847
Speaker 0: We got to be like nom nom nom nom nom nom and that's that's how.

44
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:48,680
Speaker 0: or maybe he waits like the first ant to bite him and then runs it just as a reaction, but That's how ant eaters deal with fire.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,411
Speaker 0: and so in the battle of ant eater verse fire ants who wins the ant eater could eat them all if they are patient enough to Be like, is he gone now?

46
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,917
Speaker 0: All right back to chill mode.

47
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:06,056
Speaker 1: Oh no For you nerds the anteaters probing and then kiting the ants to make sure you can get them without getting.

48
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:18,053
Speaker 0: if the anteater was a Dumb dumb and we just kept on eating the fire ants could mess up the the anteater pretty bad with their their nibblies Depending on which kind they are.

49
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:25,267
Speaker 0: All right So, uh, so if you have a fire ant infestation on at your house You wouldn't go and like rent an anteater.

50
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:26,651
Speaker 0: That would not be a good technique.

51
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what to do if I'm fire ants.

52
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:33,333
Speaker 0: Uh, I am now live where fire ants live.

53
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:36,386
Speaker 1: fire ants live is creeping north fast You what else is creeping north?

54
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:38,698
Speaker 1: There have been a bunch of malaria cases in the US now.

55
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:41,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard about that too.

56
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:45,720
Speaker 0: And the answer is if the malaria reaches, Virginia, we'll go get malaria vaccines.

57
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:46,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

58
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:55,587
Speaker 1: uh, it's funny because way back in the Roman times No, Rome was the like the city and The rich people would live there Except in the summer.

59
00:03:55,607 --> 00:04:02,198
Speaker 1: if them if there was too much malaria They would all head north for the summer and they come back down to Rome and like.

60
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:10,326
Speaker 0: that was a thing All my grandparents they went south In the winter, right?

61
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess we're gonna do the opposite.

62
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:13,817
Speaker 1: We're gonna head north in the summer, right?

63
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,899
Speaker 0: So we'll still be further south in the colder time.

64
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,449
Speaker 1: but Yeah We gotta do something about climate change.

65
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:33,806
Speaker 1: because I the other thing I saw is so, you know the other week we had the the sky turned blue blocker orange for a couple days in New York and Apparently that happened in Chicago.

66
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,593
Speaker 1: now exact same situation.

67
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,959
Speaker 1: Chicago got hit just like we did.

68
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:42,220
Speaker 0: The fundamental thing is if you want to solve climate change, we are going to need a lot of people.

69
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:48,940
Speaker 0: We're going to have to suffer Large or perhaps even we don't even have to suffer that much in convenience.

70
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:49,502
Speaker 1: I want to.

71
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,085
Speaker 1: there will be.

72
00:04:50,266 --> 00:05:03,998
Speaker 0: there will be some amount of noticeable Inconvenience that you must in less than we'd expect because from what I've seen There is a. it is still not zero and the problem is even the most minor inconvenience.

73
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,995
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Fight in any government in any country on earth.

74
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:12,759
Speaker 1: tell it American Their car has to get one more mile per gallon 20 years from now and they'll pull out a gun.

75
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:25,055
Speaker 1: But the stat was basically if Americans just Americans ate like 4% less beef just beef a year.

76
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:31,380
Speaker 1: that would make a Material impact on climate change almost immediately like that would be better.

77
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,203
Speaker 0: We could do that.

78
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:42,519
Speaker 0: we could do that by just you know mandating by law beef Production and import oddities or even just to force secretly force McDonald's.

79
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, take 4% on all your burgers.

80
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:48,582
Speaker 1: That would actually save the planet Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:49,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, never mind.

82
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,229
Speaker 1: Not even kind of quarter-pounder.

83
00:05:51,330 --> 00:06:00,854
Speaker 1: It would be 96 percent times point two five Like if we told the average American we're gonna reduce your McDonald's by 4%.

84
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:03,244
Speaker 1: some percentage of them would decide that a gun is The answer to that.

85
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,050
Speaker 0: it would be a point.

86
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,439
Speaker 0: Oh six to five pounder.

87
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:07,923
Speaker 1: Well, just call it.

88
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:09,289
Speaker 0: I know it would know that's not right.

89
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:09,771
Speaker 0: That's not right.

90
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,699
Speaker 1: We'll just call it a Royale and walk away.

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,409
Speaker 1: Redefine what a quarter pound is Or it still weighs a quarter pound.

92
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,738
Speaker 1: just fill it with fake meat.

93
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:20,042
Speaker 1: Saw.

94
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:20,525
Speaker 1: it would be.

95
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,405
Speaker 0: it would be a point to four pounder Instead of a point to five.

96
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,460
Speaker 1: so, you know way back we did a review of Marvel snap and it's pretty good game.

97
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,369
Speaker 1: But it was pretty simple Scott.

98
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,220
Speaker 0: I think you said yeah when I mean when it came out I was like, you know, hey, this is my kind of game.

99
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:40,658
Speaker 0: But right now at the time it was released we did you know, I was like this is just.

100
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,836
Speaker 0: you know It's got this micro transaction nonsense and it's sort of grindy and it's just a ladder and there's no multiplayer.

101
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,100
Speaker 0: There's no competitive scene.

102
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,671
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna play it if it doesn't have those things.

103
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:54,004
Speaker 0: and then it added those things I'm like, well they added the things.

104
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,087
Speaker 0: so I started playing.

105
00:06:55,107 --> 00:07:04,942
Speaker 1: when they added I gave them one unit of money once which I actually Regret because it got me like modok and a bunch of stuff I needed for a deck and now I'm you don't they're never Getting.

106
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,895
Speaker 0: you know, we could talk about the microtransactions more.

107
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:09,060
Speaker 0: I guess we did already.

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,795
Speaker 0: But the thing I've learned about the microtransactions that is not.

109
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:14,120
Speaker 0: I'm not to say they're good, right?

110
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,069
Speaker 0: But they're less evil than some of the others.

111
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,180
Speaker 0: Is that basically they top out?

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,929
Speaker 0: It's like you can actually sort of get all or most of the cards and then it's like you actually get Diminishing returns like if you have.

113
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,220
Speaker 0: I went and threw hundreds of dollars at the game.

114
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,360
Speaker 0: I would get basically nothing for my money, right?

115
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:40,479
Speaker 0: It's like it's pointless to spend more than like this certain reasonable ish amount You know and it's it's cheaper than netrunner, right?

116
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:49,662
Speaker 0: So if you see if you pay anyway They add that the big news is that they added this conquest mode and that's a even though he did a whole show on this Game.

117
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:53,339
Speaker 0: the conquest mode is a bit, you know, there's a lot of other news about the game, too.

118
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,593
Speaker 0: But at this mode is a big enough deal to be a news, right?

119
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:16,479
Speaker 0: So at the conquest mode is it is very similar along the lines of what Richard Garfield suggested what I heard from Richard Garfield and then modified and also suggested right they have done an implementation of Sort of automatic tournaments in sort of yep.

120
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:24,409
Speaker 0: It's better than any car online digital card turn based kind of game And I know of.

121
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:32,100
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give you this point in history Just like how Scott was like, yeah spider-man My is good enough to where we could say it's a classic for all time right now.

122
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,650
Speaker 1: Like I got to say something about mark cuz Marvel snap.

123
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:36,517
Speaker 1: That was a pooping game for me.

124
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:37,260
Speaker 1: I got a poop.

125
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,186
Speaker 1: I'll play a snap like that's just.

126
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,934
Speaker 1: I really didn't play it other than when I was bored idle.

127
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,520
Speaker 1: I like waiting for something pooping.

128
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,029
Speaker 1: I didn't have it installed in steam.

129
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,500
Speaker 1: I looked at on my phone conquest mode Reinstall it on steam.

130
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:55,702
Speaker 1: I will sit at my desk and play conquest mode the way I would play overwatch or counter-strike Cuz.

131
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,347
Speaker 0: basically it's like a game of Marvel.

132
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:00,216
Speaker 0: snap is not a very, you know deep game.

133
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,580
Speaker 0: It's pretty it's a lot very random.

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,507
Speaker 1: It's very it's really.

135
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:04,020
Speaker 1: just do I snap or do I retreat?

136
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:19,560
Speaker 0: Right, but when you have to play a car a whole conquest mode right where you're playing to get to ten points against the same opponent in repeated games That L that entire battle is about equivalent to a whole game of like Magic the Gathering, right?

137
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:28,100
Speaker 0: so Already that is significant that you're playing the sort of battle mode not just against friends, but against strangers, right?

138
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,940
Speaker 0: But they put it in the context of the conquest is you're basically playing in a tournament whenever you want.

139
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:34,984
Speaker 0: So here's how it works.

140
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:39,220
Speaker 0: The first genius thing they did is the proving grounds, right?

141
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:45,260
Speaker 0: So in other card games they have like or other online multiplayer games this casual mode.

142
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,276
Speaker 0: Right a casual mode in most games means play meaningless game.

143
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:54,694
Speaker 1: Yep, overwatch casual mode Literally worthless like not playable.

144
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:59,937
Speaker 0: right in Hearthstone they had casual mode and it was just play a meaningless game against a random opponent.

145
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:04,431
Speaker 0: and the thing is Even for people who want to play and not competitively.

146
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:07,720
Speaker 0: casual mode is kind of air because people aren't trying.

147
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,850
Speaker 0: People are just not caring.

148
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,720
Speaker 0: you're not like getting the real game.

149
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, people aren't even trying to win half the time, right?

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,727
Speaker 0: So it's like not you know, it's like not.

151
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:17,911
Speaker 0: the results don't matter.

152
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,120
Speaker 0: But also the game is not the same game.

153
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,173
Speaker 0: It's just peacely people playing cards.

154
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,280
Speaker 0: nonsense, right?

155
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,460
Speaker 0: It's you're not actually playing the game even if you don't care about competing.

156
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:37,520
Speaker 0: So the proving grounds is an effect a casual mode where there are no Consequences for losing therefore and you can play it infinitely.

157
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,899
Speaker 0: It could play it as much as you want.

158
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:44,335
Speaker 0: So you could just battle up random opponents as much as you want with no consequence of losing.

159
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,340
Speaker 0: and therefore that's casual mode.

160
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,808
Speaker 0: You could just play whatever rando deck with.

161
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,252
Speaker 0: you can test out decks.

162
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,640
Speaker 0: You can experiment you could just play a fun.

163
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,425
Speaker 0: I only play fun decks in proving grounds.

164
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:58,537
Speaker 0: I don't play serious ones because you know, why right and so.

165
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,980
Speaker 0: but the thing is when you Win in proving grounds you get a silver ticket.

166
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:11,294
Speaker 0: So because there is a reward for winning and no a real reward for winning and no punishment for losing People still try.

167
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:16,920
Speaker 0: they play Properly, right and you sort of care if you win a little bit, right?

168
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,888
Speaker 0: but if you don't care if you lose and I Can't think what other game is there that that's like that.

169
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:28,799
Speaker 0: We're like, you know, usually it's like when you have a prize for winning Let's say a cash prize like losing feels bad.

170
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:35,266
Speaker 0: You don't want to lose but they somehow perfectly tuned it to where Winning is okay.

171
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,616
Speaker 0: You get a silver ticket and losing you don't give a shit.

172
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:38,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

173
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:42,680
Speaker 0: And so perfect casual mode is the first aspect of and that's just a subset, right?

174
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,571
Speaker 0: so you get the silver ticket and you can get as many as you can get and You use the silver ticket to enter the silver conquest.

175
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,940
Speaker 0: and now the silver conquest is now serious business.

176
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

177
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,589
Speaker 1: alright now you're gonna win something.

178
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,476
Speaker 0: good you spend a silver ticket.

179
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:57,640
Speaker 0: You can't get it back.

180
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,493
Speaker 0: You could spend gold instead of a silver ticket.

181
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,880
Speaker 0: That is a sucker's game.

182
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,420
Speaker 1: Just hang out in the proving ground for like a couple never do that.

183
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, never.

184
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,611
Speaker 0: you would be a fool to do that.

185
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:08,119
Speaker 0: You got an absolute fool.

186
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,926
Speaker 0: And so you play.

187
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:14,880
Speaker 0: you have to beat you to play basically two battles against two opponents.

188
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:20,080
Speaker 0: But as you pace one opponent, yeah, if you don't beat them, you just you're out of the conquest.

189
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:21,444
Speaker 0: All right, you lose your ticket.

190
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:27,563
Speaker 0: if you beat them you face a second opponent, right if you lose to them again You just lost your ticket.

191
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:27,985
Speaker 0: you're out.

192
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:36,403
Speaker 0: But if you beat that second opponent, so two in a row you get a golden tickets Right.

193
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:47,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, then when you use the golden ticket, it's the same thing But you have to beat three opponents in a row in order to upgrade your golden ticket to the infinity Ticket.

194
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:48,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

195
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,866
Speaker 0: So it's like you now are.

196
00:12:51,006 --> 00:13:00,475
Speaker 0: you've just played in a tournament that effectively was a single elimination tournament like a NCAA bracket, right and it had five rounds.

197
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:06,953
Speaker 0: if you have five rounds That's basically against 32 people who put in a silver ticket.

198
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:10,343
Speaker 0: One of them will emerge with an infinity thing Right.

199
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,111
Speaker 0: So it's like playing at a tournament of 32 people.

200
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:20,747
Speaker 0: now if the thing is you don't have all 32 people like lined up At the start committing to play at the same time It's just when you choose play.

201
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:25,827
Speaker 0: you play against someone who is currently at the same Bracket level that you're at.

202
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:26,932
Speaker 0: And this is brilliant.

203
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,640
Speaker 1: because right why are ladders?

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,268
Speaker 0: It's someone who's made it through four rounds.

205
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:33,516
Speaker 0: just like you you've made it through four rounds.

206
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:37,971
Speaker 1: ladders are popular Just because it's very easy to have matchmaking in.

207
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,940
Speaker 1: like overwatch or something - I want to play a serious game.

208
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,920
Speaker 1: It'll just put me in a serious game and it'll give me ladder rewards.

209
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:51,540
Speaker 1: This just lets me have a tournament But I still just click a button and get into a serious game and you can play the games whenever you want.

210
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,146
Speaker 0: You can switch decks each round.

211
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,090
Speaker 0: who cares right?

212
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:06,740
Speaker 0: It's just when once you commit it's like, alright you're gonna play someone who's at the same distance through the bracket that you are and You are gonna spend your ticket and you your deck is locked in and you're gonna play a ten cube game.

213
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,929
Speaker 0: And if you retreat from this game, that's it.

214
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:09,491
Speaker 0: You're lost.

215
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,760
Speaker 0: And if you win congrats you go you can get play again.

216
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,964
Speaker 1: I am surprised of how many people concede Against me in matches when there's literally no reason to Yeah fight to the end.

217
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,586
Speaker 1: I have come back.

218
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,091
Speaker 1: I came back from.

219
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,859
Speaker 1: I only had two health left and they were fucking me up All the way to victory just by being patient.

220
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:28,869
Speaker 0: Maybe they got a good.

221
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,695
Speaker 0: it's a phone game.

222
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,604
Speaker 0: I don't care I take the win.

223
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:32,708
Speaker 0: and then what?

224
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:35,900
Speaker 0: the golden ticket upgrades to the infinity ticket, right?

225
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:44,837
Speaker 0: Now the infinity ticket is special because you can't use the infinity ticket whenever you want Just like the other tickets you can use whenever you want the silvers and golds.

226
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:49,895
Speaker 0: The infinity one can only be used in the final week of the season which has just begun.

227
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:53,747
Speaker 0: the very first infinity ticket Season has just started right?

228
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:57,680
Speaker 0: So this week is the only chance to use your infinity tickets next week.

229
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,040
Speaker 0: You won't that's it closed.

230
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,160
Speaker 0: You got to wait a whole nother set of weeks like four weeks to use them again if you gonna start from scratch, right?

231
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,660
Speaker 0: so It's like during this time period you got to use as many infinity tickets as you got.

232
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:19,972
Speaker 0: Maybe try to get some more and if you can to get the infinity ticket you and upgrade it You have to win five in a row.

233
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:23,426
Speaker 0: So that's basically another 32 player tournament.

234
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,389
Speaker 0: so you have to beat.

235
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,140
Speaker 0: let's see a 32 player tournament a 10 round tournament.

236
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,720
Speaker 0: 10 is 2 to the 10th power.

237
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,345
Speaker 0: Is that how many players are in there?

238
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:39,219
Speaker 1: right and I love how it feels like the old golden ticket raffles at RIT anime Like hold on to that ticket for the end of the season.

239
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,439
Speaker 0: I do the math here to to the.

240
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:47,470
Speaker 0: This is not a good calculator.

241
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,219
Speaker 1: That's why I have one infinity ticket.

242
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, two to the fifth power is 32.

243
00:15:52,287 --> 00:16:11,180
Speaker 0: So two to the tenth power is 1024. so out of every 1024 players Right who start in the and win approving grounds and throw a silver ticket down One of them will emerge as an infinity conquest champion.

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:23,538
Speaker 0: Right and they get basically their up avatar that they were using on the deck that they were playing gets a fancy shiny cosmetic thing to prove that they were that good and that lucky that they made it.

245
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:26,287
Speaker 0: and Now it's just a cosmetic prize.

246
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:33,371
Speaker 0: who cares right, but that's like It's so hard to get that right to win it.

247
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:40,313
Speaker 0: imagine it an NCAA tournament bracket with 1024 people and you win without losing once.

248
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,140
Speaker 0: no losers bracket, right?

249
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:50,637
Speaker 0: And it's like yeah, you could enter the tournament as many times as you want But it's like even if you held how many of those tournaments would you need to enter to win one of?

250
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:59,392
Speaker 1: I mean even getting the winner winner chicken dinner equivalent in whatever like Battle royale game you're playing feels pretty good.

251
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,199
Speaker 1: This is rarer than that, right?

252
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,220
Speaker 0: It's like it that you can enter this tournament as many times as you like.

253
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,917
Speaker 0: We'll just keep holding brand new tournaments for you all the all day long as many as you want as long as much time as you're willing to invest.

254
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,666
Speaker 0: every Tournament has a thousand and twenty four entrants.

255
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:15,849
Speaker 0: You're one of them.

256
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:19,060
Speaker 0: Can you even win one of these tournaments, right?

257
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:20,298
Speaker 0: That is so hard.

258
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:28,119
Speaker 0: So you getting that avatar and then displaying it is like walking into the boxing ring when your manager is holding belts, right?

259
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:37,508
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you intimidate anyone you will ever play again and unlike a lot of the grind Achievement type things that a lot of games have.

260
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,080
Speaker 1: this one is a skill based thing like luck.

261
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:42,573
Speaker 0: There is there is luck.

262
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:43,360
Speaker 0: It's a game of luck.

263
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, the luck does fact less luck because each opponent you're not playing just one game You're playing ten cubes work.

264
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:51,780
Speaker 0: so you can overcome luck.

265
00:17:51,901 --> 00:18:06,613
Speaker 1: but with lots of games or luck you know filters out with with lots of repeated games or two decisions you made like I made a deck and I happen to bump into someone who has the Absolute paper to my deck like I'm my deck is a rock happens.

266
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,440
Speaker 0: Yep, it happens.

267
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,125
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is like.

268
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,879
Speaker 1: this is pretty pretty great and the games are good like the games are.

269
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:23,980
Speaker 0: When you get to the goal If you spend a gold ticket you're playing against somebody who is already won a round of 32 like a big turn, right?

270
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,954
Speaker 1: This is someone like they see in round one that I don't know A car just automatically discards from your hand.

271
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,240
Speaker 1: They're like, oh they're playing a discard deck.

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,970
Speaker 1: They're probably playing a hella discard deck and then they play.

273
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,977
Speaker 1: I don't know they play Sunspot.

274
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:41,100
Speaker 1: You're like, alright Yeah, that doesn't tell me anything about what deck you're using.

275
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:47,399
Speaker 0: So anyway the whole month so far I earned three infinity tickets and then they let you buy one for free kind of.

276
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:55,700
Speaker 0: and then So I used one of them so far and I got to the fourth round and then I lost in the fourth round.

277
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:59,770
Speaker 0: So I would have had to beat that Opponent and one more opponent to get to the top.

278
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,420
Speaker 0: and I so I was that close on my first infinity ticket.

279
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,940
Speaker 0: I don't know anyone who's made it so far to the top.

280
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:10,679
Speaker 1: I just want to have my default avatar with the infinity banner around it.

281
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:16,580
Speaker 0: I just I just want to you know be the champ right or a champ one of the one of the chance.

282
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,640
Speaker 1: You want to be the very best like no one?

283
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,380
Speaker 0: There are some people out there who might have who might have done it twice already.

284
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,140
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's some streamers who play snap all day who've probably done it.

285
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,076
Speaker 1: I mean in the fact one of the questions was can I earn multiple avatars?

286
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,155
Speaker 0: and the answer is yes Absolutely as many as you can get.

287
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,097
Speaker 0: good luck You know.

288
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,268
Speaker 0: So that's it's pretty awesome.

289
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,938
Speaker 0: No other game that I know of has this.

290
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:38,644
Speaker 0: This is really good.

291
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:50,080
Speaker 1: So speaking of microtransactions and avatars and stuff battle passes Which are there is a battle pass sort of equivalent in snap that you could care about or not care about.

292
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,085
Speaker 1: I just don't bother with it.

293
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:52,591
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't.

294
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:54,540
Speaker 0: it's like the only good value for your money though.

295
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're gonna spend money, that's the thing to spend money on but I'm not spending money.

296
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:02,778
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna I'm not judging you do it that way.

297
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,833
Speaker 1: So a lot of games have battle passes.

298
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,360
Speaker 1: battle passes are not all equivalent.

299
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:13,420
Speaker 1: They are made with season passes battle some kind of pass and they're all made with different levels of success.

300
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:22,840
Speaker 1: But valve the story was valve is ditching battle passes because most players Literally to never buy one and that was the headline everywhere.

301
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:37,263
Speaker 1: But yes the actual details are valve which also has battle passes for counter-strike and I don't think they're getting rid of those is Ditching their battle passes for dota 2. and while it is true that basically they shared the data Nobody buys this thing.

302
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:43,600
Speaker 1: You have to be an absolute sucker to buy this thing because it basically doesn't get you anything.

303
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:46,180
Speaker 1: But it also might have been the first battle pass.

304
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:51,956
Speaker 1: So in some ways it broke ground, but basically valve is just saying it didn't work.

305
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,706
Speaker 1: It didn't make us money But the buried lead.

306
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:55,510
Speaker 1: that's interesting.

307
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,860
Speaker 1: Is that the number of people?

308
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:07,680
Speaker 1: Inside of valve that they said we're basically wasting their time with weeaboo like wasting their time Trying to come up with good stuff to put in the battle pass.

309
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:12,579
Speaker 1: They were like we just saved a ton of money and are probably doing better by just killing this whole fucking thing.

310
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:21,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you know I don't know much about how that battle pass and dota to work because someone told me that some of the rewards are Temporary and you lose the yes.

311
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:24,136
Speaker 0: I heard someone told me that as well that some of it.

312
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:25,360
Speaker 0: They're all cosmetic rewards.

313
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,220
Speaker 0: There are no real rewards because it's not it's only cosmetic stuff and that some of the cosmetic things you get like go away.

314
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:38,800
Speaker 0: So it's like you can get a fancy costume But you can don't like a Halloween costume that only works on Halloween and then it goes away and you can't get it again.

315
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

316
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,760
Speaker 0: why would you pay money?

317
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,770
Speaker 0: Why would anyone pay money for that when it's like?

318
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,640
Speaker 0: I feel like you know this?

319
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,462
Speaker 0: I don't.

320
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:48,480
Speaker 0: if I knew how it worked I could make a better commentary on it.

321
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:59,246
Speaker 0: But I feel like they probably could have just not done stupid shit like that and people might have wanted Yeah, cuz I counter-strike as its equivalent really want them But the variant cards in Marvel snap.

322
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:01,132
Speaker 0: people really want the hats and tf2.

323
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:05,659
Speaker 0: people really want the skins on guns and counter-strike that They'll gamble with them and spent piles of money for them.

324
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,275
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't people really want cosmetic shit in dota - yeah.

325
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:10,300
Speaker 1: and meanwhile?

326
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:17,159
Speaker 1: Something was wrong definitely has similar stuff And I assume people are buying those because they didn't cut that.

327
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:21,800
Speaker 1: But no, I know a little bit about how the counter-strike ones work, and they're absolute garbage.

328
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,044
Speaker 1: There's nothing there like.

329
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:25,552
Speaker 1: the cosmetics are really sad, and I can't know.

330
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:31,697
Speaker 0: I think the only reason people want the counters for the gamblings Because they're literally worth money to somebody.

331
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:33,406
Speaker 0: therefore They're worth money to like.

332
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:40,732
Speaker 0: if someone's gonna spend a thousand dollars for one and suddenly Everyone else wants one because they think they can sell it and get a thousand They don't want the skins they want the thousand dollars.

333
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:48,469
Speaker 1: fact late last year Scott and I were talking about selling old crap in the valve like steam marketplace And I was poo-pooing it because I didn't want to spend.

334
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:51,560
Speaker 0: I bought a lot of Marvel snap stuff selling young car.

335
00:22:51,781 --> 00:23:00,345
Speaker 1: I didn't want to click even once if it was just gonna get me like a cent or two But I did go look and I had a counter-strike skin that was worth like 20 bucks And I sold it and someone

336
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:01,047
Speaker 0: someone

337
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:07,050
Speaker 1: paid like 19 real Dollars for a skin.

338
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,679
Speaker 0: that valve took a cut and you got the rest.

339
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:09,860
Speaker 1: yeah.

340
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:13,080
Speaker 1: So I got like 16 bucks for nothing.

341
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,130
Speaker 0: Yep, literally nothing for playing counter-strike.

342
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,456
Speaker 0: They paid you to play counter-strike.

343
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:28,530
Speaker 0: Yeah And click a button afterwards But anyway things of the day.

344
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:29,694
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

345
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:33,770
Speaker 1: because I thought you had something different until I actually clicked on this link, and this is way better.

346
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:42,023
Speaker 0: I'm sure this is old news to many, but it was new news to me that apparently Yellowstone National Park, you know the place where Yogi Bear is from right?

347
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess Jellystone is.

348
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:46,220
Speaker 0: You know I knew that it was.

349
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:52,870
Speaker 0: I knew it's general geography But I didn't know it's specific geography and that it takes up a lot of a big chunk of Wyoming.

350
00:23:53,051 --> 00:24:04,630
Speaker 0: But it actually takes this sliver in Montana on the north and west sides And also takes this tiny sliver and the southwest in Idaho right and but most of its in Wyoming right?

351
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,027
Speaker 0: It's basically the northwest corner of Wyoming But a sliver of Montana and a little like an l-shape and a sliver in Idaho.

352
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:14,809
Speaker 0: now There's a in the u.s.. Right the the law is.

353
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:24,437
Speaker 0: Constitution says that you know if you commit some crimes there in a national federal land that you States can't do anything about that.

354
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:27,108
Speaker 0: That's a federal crime for federal courts to deal with.

355
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:29,296
Speaker 1: yeah This comes up a lot in DC.

356
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,735
Speaker 1: Which is not in any state exactly.

357
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:43,850
Speaker 0: now if you also You know commit a federal crime you have to go to federal court Which is one of those district courts, and you obviously there's a district court that covers any spot.

358
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,490
Speaker 0: You are in the US and its territories.

359
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,988
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a district court that covers that area.

360
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,470
Speaker 0: yeah If for some reason there wasn't which there is that you could I guess avoid, but there is right.

361
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:59,350
Speaker 0: So the district that covers that area right is in Wyoming obviously?

362
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:15,789
Speaker 0: and The thing is is that you also when you go to federal court you need to get a jury and the people on that jury Have to live in that district right and they also have to live in the same state where you did the crime.

363
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:27,340
Speaker 0: So if you do a crime so you rob a pick a nick a basket Yellowstone, Wyoming right well There's people who live in the district and also in Wyoming.

364
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,610
Speaker 0: not a lot of them, but enough to make a jury right there's.

365
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:31,753
Speaker 1: There's.

366
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:35,444
Speaker 1: there's nine angry people who just live there the only people they're on.

367
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:43,183
Speaker 0: if you go to that little sliver in Montana right It's like there are a few people living there.

368
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:45,110
Speaker 0: There's like in those inhabited areas.

369
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,599
Speaker 0: it would be tough to make a jury, but they could.

370
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,124
Speaker 0: there's enough people right.

371
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:55,883
Speaker 0: someone did a crime there and They basically plead on the condition that they don't try to fight this condition.

372
00:25:56,104 --> 00:26:00,295
Speaker 0: right, but the sliver in Idaho No one lives there.

373
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:01,378
Speaker 0: No one.

374
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:11,890
Speaker 0: so even though there are people living in the district in Wyoming You commit the crime in the Idaho part of Yellowstone Park where no one lives except a bear right?

375
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,828
Speaker 0: We can't be on a jury because he's not your peer.

376
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:22,070
Speaker 0: There's no one to make a jury because no one lives in Idaho and also in the district in which the court is.

377
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:30,590
Speaker 0: So it's called the zone of death because theoretically You could kill someone there and get away with it because it's this note.

378
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,609
Speaker 0: They could never make a jury to do anything about it.

379
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:38,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's only like one person wrote a work of like a short story or something where this happened.

380
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:43,227
Speaker 1: There was one case with a poacher that tested this but that was it.

381
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,010
Speaker 0: that was in the Montana.

382
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:52,156
Speaker 1: It was only a few people but even worse the Idaho part has no people but even that one It looks like in the end.

383
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:53,721
Speaker 1: They never got appealed up.

384
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:54,845
Speaker 0: I said that already.

385
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,510
Speaker 0: Yes, so it was about that.

386
00:26:56,751 --> 00:27:00,068
Speaker 1: So we mentioned the whole thing, but our religion is record never got to rule out it.

387
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:04,609
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, they made them plea on the condition that they wouldn't fight it.

388
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:07,814
Speaker 1: I Someone's got some day.

389
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:08,837
Speaker 1: I would love to see it.

390
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,730
Speaker 0: Well, hopefully no one kills anyone except maybe Yogi bear.

391
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:16,843
Speaker 1: But we got to go there and go run a casino not being killed.

392
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,030
Speaker 0: Oh Or this is bling in the zone.

393
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,293
Speaker 1: Piracy.

Speaker 1: run the run the pirate bay there.

395
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,050
Speaker 1: hide a server in the woods with the satellite uplink.

396
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,294
Speaker 1: Mmm, that's how you do this.

397
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:32,077
Speaker 1: forget zone of death.

398
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:35,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's do some moral morally acceptable crime.

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,609
Speaker 1: It was cute enough to where I think everyone should see this.

414
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:22,092
Speaker 1: It was.

415
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:24,465

Speaker 0: There you go, it's really short.

432
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:26,601
Speaker 1: I imagine The the next Thursday's show.

433
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,230
Speaker 1: we do other than the one this Thursday.

434
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,157
Speaker 1: So you have enough time.

435
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:30,406
Speaker 1: like you can read the book.

436
00:29:30,447 --> 00:29:32,499
Speaker 1: in two weeks I'm probably ready to read the whole book.

437
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,270
Speaker 1: I did not because I've been busy doing other stuff.

438
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,884
Speaker 1: this book looks like it is a Light evening reading like one night.

439
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:47,407
Speaker 1: read it after dinner Maybe me or maybe a pleasant afternoon at most if you're a slow reader, but what one?

440
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:48,270
Speaker 0: one or two beaches?

441
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:51,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this will be the next Thursday episode.

442
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:54,549
Speaker 1: the following Thursday episode will be this episode.

443
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:55,538
Speaker 0: Okay.

444
00:29:56,124 --> 00:29:56,630
Speaker 1: All right.

445
00:29:57,252 --> 00:30:04,836
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we will be in the other meta on Sunday with a actually all-new panel Details TBD.

446
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:05,921
Speaker 1: you'll see an update soon.

447
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,367
Speaker 1: got some thoughts on the panel?

448
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:07,890
Speaker 1: be a fun one.

449
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:13,186
Speaker 1: We also have some pretty good ideas for some unplugged content that I think you would all appreciate.

450
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:14,370
Speaker 1: so stay tuned for that.

451
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:19,183
Speaker 1: But Ignites panels live stuff YouTube videos lectures.

452
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:25,575
Speaker 1: It's all coming back baby kick knives back in the real world and Gonna get right into it.

453
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:33,339
Speaker 1: because this you might remember way way back in 2011 2012. this was a long time ago.

454
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,710
Speaker 1: We did a panel in the tiny tiny panel room.

455
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:45,996
Speaker 1: This was a PAX East where we did three panels, but two of the panels were in this tiny workshop room Seated like 100 people tiny tiny little room.

456
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:51,755
Speaker 1: and we did two back-to-back panels that we didn't think would be super popular compared to our big stuff.

457
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:58,021
Speaker 1: one was called Mastering game mechanics and one was called practically in theory People line the fuck up to see mastering game mechanics.

458
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,210
Speaker 1: almost no one got to see it in the room completely packed.

459
00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:07,064
Speaker 1: but mastering game mechanics was about Game mechanics, like let's talk about a bunch of game mechanics and explain their deal.

460
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,097
Speaker 1: and Scott had the brilliant idea Why don't we do a show?

461
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:16,330
Speaker 1: it's easy easy content farm idea Yeah, but it's such a good idea because we got a lot to say about this time.

462
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:22,447
Speaker 0: Let's just do one panel slash episode slash whatever each video for each game mechanical.

463
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,530
Speaker 0: break it down even more.

464
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can go deep go deeper.

465
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,705
Speaker 0: instead of doing all these game mechanics and one in one shot We'll just do one at a time.

466
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:33,650
Speaker 0: Yeah And the right of ideas, that's what I got.

467
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:39,430
Speaker 1: But worker placement seemed like a good one to start with partly because I we have a lot of thoughts about it.

468
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:39,832
Speaker 1: It's all.

469
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:40,737
Speaker 1: that's a game mechanic.

470
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:41,059
Speaker 1: I like.

471
00:31:41,341 --> 00:32:03,888
Speaker 1: but I also realized something important because the problem with talking about game mechanics is that it's very easy to say that any X-act thing in a game could arguably be classified as a bunch of different kinds of game mechanics based on how you look at it, like you could argue that a lot of things in games are Effectively worker placement, even if they don't look like it.

472
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,030
Speaker 1: So I want to get out of the way that I think we can do something clever.

473
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:13,350
Speaker 1: It's the same thing you do in math Where you multiply something by one to make it look different for the purposes of a conversation.

474
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:27,290
Speaker 1: I think even if a mechanic could arguably be worker placement in effect to talk about it as worker placement We should multiply it by one so that it looks like worker placement to have the conversation.

475
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:29,749
Speaker 1: Then we were always talking about it the same way.

476
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:37,059
Speaker 0: Well, I think one of the things is that a lot of people, you know Can't align game mechanics with each other so easily.

477
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:44,901
Speaker 0: even me I have a problem because especially tabletop You'll have the same mechanic implemented with different components.

478
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:48,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, that will confuse like physical components, right?

479
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,990
Speaker 0: So it's like someone would be like, oh no, this is a card game.

480
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,790
Speaker 0: Look, I'm playing cards and someone's like well putting a meeple on a space.

481
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,537
Speaker 0: That's not the same thing as playing a card.

482
00:32:56,597 --> 00:33:00,633
Speaker 1: arguably action and worker placement are the exact same thing Right.

483
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:04,490
Speaker 0: It's like if they're mathematically equivalent if they're functionally equivalent.

484
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:07,750
Speaker 0: If you if you make the game into just a spreadsheet, right?

485
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,599
Speaker 0: Is it the same in on the spreadsheet?

486
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,910
Speaker 0: and it's like if it is the same on the spreadsheet then is the same game mechanic?

487
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,504
Speaker 0: Regardless of you know, rolling a dive or spinning a spinner verse.

488
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:20,390
Speaker 0: They're all RNG on the spreadsheet, right?

489
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,995
Speaker 0: So they're all the same mechanic that way.

490
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:35,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time Worker placement is something I think that's very easy to engage with because this concept like a lot of the games We like the most use worker placement as a primary mechanic.

491
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,440
Speaker 1: It's often the primary mechanic of a game.

492
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:40,306
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,092
Speaker 0: All right.

494
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:42,220
Speaker 0: So what is worker placement?

495
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:50,021
Speaker 0: So worker placement is you have a game and there are a set of actions that a player may take on their turn Right.

496
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:59,378
Speaker 0: Usually those are the only things players do in the game are this set of actions and you can choose some subset of those actions to perform.

497
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:15,250
Speaker 0: as You know your as your agency in the game is basically choosing which of those actions you will take in which order when the opportunity presents itself to you the player right and Typically for a worker placement game, right?

498
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:28,340
Speaker 0: The actions will usually almost definitely be Exclusive or at least limited so that when you choose to take an action You will also be denying other players from taking that action at least for the that turn.

499
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,444
Speaker 1: I think that's our future.

500
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:39,980
Speaker 0: very good way to define it because that right because if everyone can take all the same actions That's a cut that fundamentally changes like everything that is just action drafting or action points.

501
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,304
Speaker 1: Like action drafting.

502
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:46,360
Speaker 1: action points are almost a superset worker placement to put some constraints on it, right?

503
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:50,179
Speaker 0: But it's like such a significant constraint that it makes it a completely different game.

504
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,408
Speaker 0: Definitely all the heuristics are different.

505
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:56,864
Speaker 1: all the wit everything's did like about every worker placement games Most people know like Agricola.

506
00:34:57,126 --> 00:35:00,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I put my guy on the baby, you can't make a baby this round.

507
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,806
Speaker 1: That's that's the game.

508
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:03,416
Speaker 1: is who gets the baby first exact.

509
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:03,979
Speaker 0: That's the whole game.

510
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:10,140
Speaker 0: Yeah Which is a lot of work or at least some limit right like only two people there's only two spots on that action.

511
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,455
Speaker 0: It's three spots on that action and that action has infinity spots and that one has only one spot.

512
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:20,960
Speaker 1: sometimes as long as there's some Sometimes you get the limit is is more abstract or different like a limit.

513
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,209
Speaker 1: I've seen games where I'd still think this is worker placement.

514
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,009
Speaker 1: the first person to go there gets the good version But all the second person gets the crappy version.

515
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,835
Speaker 0: third person can't get anything exactly.

516
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen that.

517
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:41,772
Speaker 0: So yeah It's there's some set of actions and on your basic the main thing that players do is Choose which of those actions they all perform.

518
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:43,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's a worker placement game.

519
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:52,920
Speaker 1: I think it I think it is drizz lens itself toward Being a primary mechanic in a game as opposed to something that is just there in a much bigger game.

520
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:53,664
Speaker 1: There aren't.

521
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:56,259
Speaker 1: there aren't that many good games where?

522
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,840
Speaker 1: Placing workers is one of many actions you can take like that turns into those turn into salad games pretty quickly and get weird.

523
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:08,636
Speaker 1: I feel like most of the games that I would consider good personally that include worker placement.

524
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:13,020
Speaker 1: worker placement is Primary or it's very prominent in the game.

525
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:19,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could just have like a little sideshow where it's like, okay you play this whole game That's actually somewhere else.

526
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:25,347
Speaker 0: and then one of the bonus parts of the game is like, you know You have these workers that you put into spots, right?

527
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:25,688
Speaker 0: It's like.

528
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:34,013
Speaker 0: but choosing workers to go into spots, even though it's a simple mechanic It's easy to understand you can teach it to anyone pretty quickly right?

529
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:36,280
Speaker 0: even people aren't super gamer II, right?

530
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,719
Speaker 0: It's that those choices are.

531
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,451
Speaker 0: So there's so much that goes into those choices.

532
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:55,560
Speaker 0: if you're actually trying right that It takes so much of your cognitive energies Even in such an even in a simple worker placement game right that you can't be having that as a sideshow.

533
00:36:55,702 --> 00:36:56,819
Speaker 0: It needs to be the focus.

534
00:36:57,463 --> 00:37:05,697
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's just sort of a pain in the ass like ah I got to do figure out all this just for the side bit for ten bonus point over here.

535
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:07,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like not work.

536
00:37:07,414 --> 00:37:07,840
Speaker 1: No, that's right.

537
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:16,320
Speaker 1: I'd also have to say I would actually put another constraint on it because there's I forget what it's called But in like Hansa to a tonic, uh, you can put the worker or the token in the place.

538
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,454
Speaker 1: They get you victory points and there's a limited number of them.

539
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,280
Speaker 1: There is a constraint.

540
00:37:19,522 --> 00:37:20,835
Speaker 1: It looks like worker placement.

541
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:21,360
Speaker 1: in some ways.

542
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:31,786
Speaker 1: I would argue that if The only actions the only result of placing workers is victory points or an equivalent as opposed to other Impacts to the game.

543
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:32,793
Speaker 1: It's not worker placement.

544
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:33,518
Speaker 1: That's something different.

545
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:41,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, now if there is a worker location that gets you a victory point But there's other worker locations that do something else mechanically.

546
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:45,528
Speaker 1: I think that's fine But if they only get you victory points, it's not worker placement.

547
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,518
Speaker 1: It's something else that I'd struggle to come up with a name for.

548
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:54,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the the first worker like the first game that we knew was worker placement.

549
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:59,520
Speaker 0: like when we played it and I think Historically, we're still trying to figure out is Kayla's right?

550
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,980
Speaker 1: Yep, Kayla's was my I literally encountered the concept of worker placement.

551
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,550
Speaker 1: That was one of the early German board games.

552
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,073
Speaker 1: We got into.

553
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:08,400
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of money in that fucking game.

554
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,685
Speaker 1: Or did you one of us bought it?

555
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:14,866
Speaker 0: I had I think you bought it when it was Brent when it was brand new There was a big a big rave about it.

556
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:15,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought it.

557
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,900
Speaker 1: I bought El Grande early and and Decker.

558
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:22,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the thing is so.

559
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,316
Speaker 0: you came at this like one of the first ones if not the first one.

560
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:28,559
Speaker 1: bus is arguably the First one which I hadn't played it away later.

561
00:38:29,302 --> 00:38:35,120
Speaker 0: So what introduced right as sort of this the the features of the worker placement, right?

562
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,682
Speaker 0: Was that?

563
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 0: you know, obviously you only had a few a limited number of workers, right?

564
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,736
Speaker 0: I don't think there was a way to get more and Kayla's I think just everyone had the same number, right?

565
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:49,289
Speaker 0: I think so Yeah, but it definitely had the okay.

566
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,380
Speaker 0: certain actions sort of go together and overlap a little bit.

567
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:55,326
Speaker 0: But there are like these Pat.

568
00:38:55,366 --> 00:39:00,020
Speaker 0: there are some that like you said generate victory points that have certain inputs, right?

569
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:13,020
Speaker 0: It was like some of them generate resources and then some of them shift resources and some of them turn resources into victory points, and so you basically Had to sort of pick which of the victory point ones you were gonna go for it.

570
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:25,020
Speaker 0: There was like a jewelry one and the castle right and the favors and so you couldn't with the number of workers You had you couldn't you do all these things at once right or at least not.

571
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,007
Speaker 0: Well, you had to pick one to really go for big time And I think that sort of holds true.

572
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:36,384
Speaker 0: and basically even though worker placement games have way different shapes You know how many years?

573
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:40,739
Speaker 0: 10 to 20 almost how many years of development since then?

574
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,678
Speaker 0: That that sort of still holds true and that you know, there's different the the the actions sort of.

575
00:39:47,979 --> 00:40:05,099
Speaker 0: you know Different paths and you're trying to combine sets of actions together That don't overlap the other players because then you end up blocking each other and not getting ahead so much But then lead to one of this, you know being able to play the strong actions that actually win the game.

576
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:10,360
Speaker 1: Now I think another interesting discussion point and we can't be exhaustive here.

577
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,677
Speaker 1: I don't think even in multiple panels or writing a book we could be exhaustive.

578
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:23,135
Speaker 1: but Much like how trick-taking games or trick-taking is a mechanic We there's like different characteristics like must follow suit versus may follow suit.

579
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:24,017
Speaker 1: are there Trump's?

580
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:24,960
Speaker 1: are there multiple trumps?

581
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:49,339
Speaker 1: there are a lot of characteristics that in combination are what I think make worker placement so compelling because I Bet there's at least 30 or 40 unique definable Characteristics that could be applied to worker placement and every few games have the exact same Characteristics together because I think they tend to become very likely the same game if they do that.

582
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:54,900
Speaker 1: One example would be are all of the player worker of the places workers can go?

583
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:56,990
Speaker 1: Are they all available from the start?

584
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,819
Speaker 1: are they revealed in some way?

585
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,718
Speaker 1: Are they ownable by players in some way?

586
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:05,258
Speaker 1: Like do I put a worker on the board and I get a baby?

587
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:09,576
Speaker 1: or Does Scott build a place and if I put a worker there Scott gets a dollar?

588
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:10,620
Speaker 1: those are red.

589
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:15,275
Speaker 0: Some games allow players to like choose what the available actions will be.

590
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:20,000
Speaker 0: like you have cards in your hand Yeah, like and you play the card, right?

591
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,660
Speaker 0: And now that card is now an action.

592
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,340
Speaker 0: So you're choosing which actions are available to everyone or choosing which actions are available to yourself.

593
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,966
Speaker 0: Right rather than just.

594
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:35,647
Speaker 0: here's a set of actions that are pre-prescribed by the game and That's it right Agricola.

595
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:40,239
Speaker 0: They're pre-prescribed, but the order they come out They're available in is slightly randomized.

596
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,866
Speaker 0: Hey, this game is a little bit different.

597
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:49,099
Speaker 1: a player will build the building and that's a worker placement spot But also they get a privilege if they use it and other players have to pay them if they use it.

598
00:41:50,060 --> 00:42:01,180
Speaker 0: Yep, another characteristic kinds of variations on the controlling of what are the actions right some permanent actions some random actions Right because you know a game might not work is like you might have a bad deal.

599
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,931
Speaker 0: We're like all none of all the if you randomize just everything it's like well No one can play the game because no there's no basic action available.

600
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:11,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no way to get wood wood powers everything else Softlock you need to have.

601
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,140
Speaker 0: usually you need to have some sort of basic area.

602
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:17,649
Speaker 0: That's like yes This action is always available in the game no matter what.

603
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,906
Speaker 0: so you can no matter what happens you can play and I think that Is a common mechanic.

604
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:27,540
Speaker 1: most worker placement games I can think of off the top of my head have like Some base things like Everdell.

605
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:32,388
Speaker 1: There's the base actions that are like get some wood and then there's the advanced stuff And then there's the win.

606
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:33,115
Speaker 1: more stuff like.

607
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,746
Speaker 1: there's different Classes of the types of actions you could take.

608
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:40,019
Speaker 1: win more tends to be a pile of victory points instead of an in-game advantage.

609
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:43,045
Speaker 1: Another aspect is the immediacy.

610
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,194
Speaker 1: like some games put a worker out get the thing.

611
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:52,633
Speaker 1: other games put a worker out Next turn or at some point in the future the worker comes back with the thing.

612
00:42:53,014 --> 00:43:00,319
Speaker 1: some games worker stays there Even after you got the odd like after the thing happened until some future event happens.

613
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:05,253
Speaker 0: Yep, yeah, it's all kinds of stuff like that, so it's like you're managing right?

614
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:07,360
Speaker 0: you know how do you have workers available?

615
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,558
Speaker 0: You know do you throw them out too early?

616
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,164
Speaker 0: You hold on to them too long?

617
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:20,137
Speaker 0: you could have gotten more stuff right, but I think you know the majority of these games Right are games in which you put a worker to get stuff right there.

618
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:32,166
Speaker 0: resource Collections as well, but worker placement does not have to be Resource collection even though the majority of tabletop games that are worker placement games are Resource collecting games.

619
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:38,585
Speaker 0: for example you could make Tetris, and there are Three actions.

620
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:45,402
Speaker 0: actually there's flip left flip right slam it down and Like.

621
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:45,984
Speaker 0: is that it?

622
00:43:46,366 --> 00:43:50,520
Speaker 0: oh no the next right you know swap put the piece in the storage right.

623
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:51,945
Speaker 0: So those are your four actions.

624
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:58,967
Speaker 0: now imagine playing a Tetris where you've got like two workers Right and those are your four choices.

625
00:43:59,489 --> 00:43:59,750
Speaker 0: right.

626
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:04,167
Speaker 0: and now it's not a resource collection game anymore But it sure is the worker.

627
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:06,015
Speaker 0: Oh move left and move right those you need.

628
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:10,169
Speaker 0: those also right yeah And maybe I'll give you three workers with this.

629
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,365
Speaker 0: so it's like you know and you got to choose Right.

630
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:16,119
Speaker 0: it's like that could be considered a worker placement game.

631
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:18,185
Speaker 0: You're really limited.

632
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:23,520
Speaker 0: you might not be able to put the piece in the spot you want because You know yeah work right?

633
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,819
Speaker 0: It's like maybe I draw a piece that I want to put in the left side of my board.

634
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,831
Speaker 0: Rim draws a piece he wants to put in the left side of his Tetris board.

635
00:44:29,851 --> 00:44:32,119
Speaker 0: I go first and I move mine left.

636
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:35,758
Speaker 0: Rim's got to now find a place to put his piece on the right or the middle.

637
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:38,782
Speaker 0: yeah Trouble.

638
00:44:39,003 --> 00:44:40,994
Speaker 1: and there's also you know one at one common thing.

639
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:55,269
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about is that Typically the danger of designing a worker placement game is if your game allows for players to get more workers that Tends to be overpowered and it is rare.

640
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:04,600
Speaker 1: There is a game that successfully navigates that challenge without Giving everyone more workers or having extreme constraints on more workers.

641
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:13,247
Speaker 0: Well, I think one thing I've thought about that in the past right is that it's sort of obvious right like okay Taking at if all the actions don't change.

642
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:15,132
Speaker 0: the actions are what they are right.

643
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:20,709
Speaker 0: so being able to do more of them is like Taking more turns than other players, and that's just.

644
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:25,987
Speaker 0: it's obvious that like no matter what other rules there are in your game Taking actions is good.

645
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,193
Speaker 0: There's never.

646
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:27,875
Speaker 0: there's no action.

647
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:28,940
Speaker 0: That's like hurt myself.

648
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:40,493
Speaker 0: Every action brings you closer to victory so taking more actions is Necessarily more powerful than anything else that you could possibly conceive of.

649
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:46,369
Speaker 0: so games that allow you to get more workers Agricola right it's like you are aiming for.

650
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:50,280
Speaker 0: that is above all else right strategically right.

651
00:45:50,360 --> 00:46:02,895
Speaker 0: But I do think there is an interesting design to be had where you could Scale the actions be give everyone ten workers right like go wild everyone.

652
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:13,713
Speaker 0: you get ten workers right but If you the how strong each action is will be Proportional to the total number of workers you choose to use.

653
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:20,054
Speaker 0: so if you put one worker on gather wood And that's it that's effectively the same as having all ten workers gather wood.

654
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:23,485
Speaker 0: therefore you get a fuck Simple makeup rules.

655
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:24,368
Speaker 1: now you get ten wood.

656
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:28,088
Speaker 1: if I put two workers out one on wood and one on stone I get five Wood and five stone.

657
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,300
Speaker 1: put ten workers out.

658
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:35,040
Speaker 0: So it's like you can choose how many workers to place and how many things you want to do.

659
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,131
Speaker 0: but the more you do the shittier you do each one.

660
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,660
Speaker 0: and then now you sort of solve that problem of.

661
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:42,182
Speaker 0: You know.

662
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:45,092
Speaker 0: okay, you know having more workers is just better.

663
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:45,674
Speaker 1: I can't think of it.

664
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:46,116
Speaker 1: does that?

665
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:46,216
Speaker 1: no

666
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:59,647
Speaker 0: I can't think of any game that does that either But at the same time you're still giving the players the choices of okay You don't need to do that many different things for your strategy because you've thought of a way to get by with just a few Types of actions.

667
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,960
Speaker 0: good you'll boost all those actions.

668
00:47:02,545 --> 00:47:04,118
Speaker 0: Oh, you thought of a way to do.

669
00:47:04,178 --> 00:47:06,207
Speaker 0: well But it requires diversification.

670
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:12,330
Speaker 0: you can diversify a whole lot and get all kinds of stuff going on But you're gonna do each of those things more weekly.

671
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:20,830
Speaker 0: so you're better take advantage of that Diversification to get ahead of the person who's only got a few things But has a lot of them now right and that could even out.

672
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,838
Speaker 0: if you did the math properly it would be still be fair.

673
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:30,780
Speaker 1: Two other ways to address that one I've seen and One I haven't but I have an example from what I would argue is not a worker placement game.

674
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:38,083
Speaker 1: what I've seen is you can get more workers, but either there is an extreme cost to that or Workers have to.

675
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:40,750
Speaker 1: there's some cost to placing a worker.

676
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:46,710
Speaker 1: thus having more workers has a higher burn rate of your Resources and that could be tuned and balanced.

677
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:47,835
Speaker 0: I've seen I mean a grickle.

678
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:52,353
Speaker 0: you have to feed your family Appropriately though they don't they don't scale it well.

679
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:58,291
Speaker 1: having another worker is So much better and so much more valuable than any amount of eating you have.

680
00:47:58,311 --> 00:47:58,672
Speaker 0: because?

681
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:05,880
Speaker 1: well because inherently for that mechanic to work Right I think you need more workers and more stuff going on for that mechanic to work well.

682
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,784
Speaker 0: So here's the thing right.

683
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,920
Speaker 0: it's like let's say you need X resources to like maintain a work.

684
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

685
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:24,413
Speaker 0: so therefore even if you have just one worker And that's it You still need the game has to be structured in such a way that the one worker can produce enough stuff to maintain themselves and Also more than that right.

686
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:29,437
Speaker 0: therefore Having ten workers will also produce enough to feed the ten workers.

687
00:48:29,497 --> 00:48:33,479
Speaker 1: the board is Constrained or there's something else going on where you don't with you.

688
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,809
Speaker 1: You know you need multiple currencies multiple resources would need.

689
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:49,822
Speaker 0: you would need to make the cost to maintain a worker Exponential Relative to the number of workers so that cost it so that the maintenance for ten workers isn't just ten times the maintenance of one Worker.

690
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:52,332
Speaker 0: it would be like you know one to like.

691
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,898
Speaker 0: you know some power right.

692
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:54,280
Speaker 0: so that way.

693
00:48:54,621 --> 00:49:05,535
Speaker 0: But then even if you did that everyone could just do the math and realize oh if I have five workers That's the sweet spot where they produce more The margins they produce versus.

694
00:49:05,596 --> 00:49:12,077
Speaker 1: I feel like you're right Like a Pareto frontier of like three four or five workers in this particular game are the good ones.

695
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,207
Speaker 1: more than that You're very likely going to lose less than that.

696
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:19,627
Speaker 0: having a very likely having a cost on the workers is basically just Setting.

697
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:25,915
Speaker 0: you might as well just say okay Well the limit is five because buying six workers now they cost more to have than to use.

698
00:49:26,316 --> 00:49:27,660
Speaker 0: so why would anyone ever get it?

699
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:42,073
Speaker 1: So I think it's possible, but it requires very good design and balance and requires likely Multiple independent currencies and some worker actions might require One or more resources from those different currencies.

700
00:49:42,093 --> 00:49:42,696
Speaker 1: you can try to.

701
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:43,579
Speaker 0: I think you could have.

702
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:50,360
Speaker 0: Think you could have things where like if you're playing the game with this strategy the woods Strategy that like six workers is perfect.

703
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:59,832
Speaker 0: But if you're going down the the gold strategy then maybe you need seven workers because you need seven dwarves Gold right and it the way those actions are constructed.

704
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:08,060
Speaker 0: and then but that still would just be Figure out the optimal number of workers for each strategy, and I guess the point is everything we discussed.

705
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:19,160
Speaker 1: but if you can get more workers, or you can use more workers than someone else then Figuring that out becomes the most important skill in the game.

706
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:24,113
Speaker 0: Yes What the one way you can balance it is the way you can balance anything.

707
00:50:24,213 --> 00:50:26,200
Speaker 0: which is that if there are going to be?

708
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,680
Speaker 0: Additional actions you know hand it out above the other and it's not symmetrical between all players.

709
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:34,970
Speaker 0: Then you have to use an auction of some.

710
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,040
Speaker 1: auction is the escape edge for almost any balance problems.

711
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:41,140
Speaker 0: You need some auction or something right and it's like okay?

712
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,705
Speaker 0: If you let someone buy the extra worker for a dollar and you lose because of that well It's that was your own fault right.

713
00:50:46,745 --> 00:50:53,647
Speaker 0: but people if you had to bid in Agricola for with food to buy the baby Right at the baby market.

714
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,333
Speaker 0: It's like the game would be.

715
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:55,855
Speaker 0: that's it.

716
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:57,100
Speaker 0: the game is not balanced right?

717
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:03,109
Speaker 0: No one's gonna run away with the extra baby and win the game because the food they had to pay to get it Would even out.

718
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:08,840
Speaker 1: now a third way to go And I'm thinking some spitball in this partly because I can't think of a worker placement game.

719
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,592
Speaker 1: That's done this but Hansa toy tonica does this.

720
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:13,600
Speaker 1: it's a run actions not workers.

721
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:18,839
Speaker 1: You can spend resources to upgrade your actions and have more actions.

722
00:51:19,602 --> 00:51:33,340
Speaker 1: But you can also spend resources to do other things in the game that are equally powerful to having more actions And thus it actually does create contention like if multiple people are trying to get more actions.

723
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:39,960
Speaker 1: You can almost do better by doing other less contentious things and level up other similarly powerful actions.

724
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:46,080
Speaker 1: But I struggle to apply that to worker placement in this context, but I feel like there's something there.

725
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:50,518
Speaker 1: But humps is a weird and other things that other games haven't done across the board.

726
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:58,447
Speaker 0: Another thing that's really simple to do is just have a way for people to lose workers One time use or dead work.

727
00:51:58,487 --> 00:51:58,909
Speaker 1: Oh great.

728
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,133
Speaker 1: I forget the victory points.

729
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:00,856
Speaker 1: What if a curricula was?

730
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:01,960
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you couldn't feed that kid.

731
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,546
Speaker 1: They're gone.

732
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:03,717
Speaker 0: That sucks.

733
00:52:03,757 --> 00:52:05,626
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah shit like that.

734
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:10,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like, you know, okay, so You know you can still.

735
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,160
Speaker 0: people can get more workers.

736
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,610
Speaker 0: They put resources into that.

737
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:25,155
Speaker 0: but you know It might not be a huge impact if that worker like isn't just some permanent upgrade that makes them 20 25% stronger than the everyone else for the whole rest of the game.

738
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,890
Speaker 0: if it's just okay You're 25% stronger for a turn or two.

739
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:35,940
Speaker 0: It's like then it's not as big a deal and now it's not obviously so strong because that you would just have to go.

740
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:40,540
Speaker 1: I've seen games where you can't get an extra permanent worker, but you can like get a temporary worker.

741
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:41,918
Speaker 1: That's good for some number of uses.

742
00:52:42,903 --> 00:52:51,540
Speaker 1: Yeah seen games like that So, huh now I'm thinking about because one thing that I think is really important is worker placement Even if the game does it some other way.

743
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:57,797
Speaker 1: I Like the physicality of having some sort of token that I put in a public place like place it out there.

744
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,424
Speaker 1: It's visible It's physical.

745
00:52:59,966 --> 00:53:01,052
Speaker 1: I think that's important.

746
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:02,760
Speaker 1: But I also think it's underused.

747
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:10,305
Speaker 1: There are so few worker placement games where our worker is so many way to know where a worker Might have to.

748
00:53:10,746 --> 00:53:17,850
Speaker 1: what if the worker placement the worker has to move around the map to get to the place Like in a grid?

749
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:23,040
Speaker 1: what if Whoever has the most workers in a place is the only one that gets to do the thing?

750
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:25,271
Speaker 1: It's a colonel blotto mixed with worker placement.

751
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:30,391
Speaker 0: I mean you have like Genoa Genoa moving around a little.

752
00:53:30,411 --> 00:53:35,440
Speaker 0: you're moving around the town Yeah, or it's like you could even consider clue sort of like that, right?

753
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,440
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you know You can only inquire about the study if you're standing in the study the action.

754
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,104
Speaker 0: It's like you might.

755
00:53:41,648 --> 00:53:48,180
Speaker 0: you might know it was the conservatory But you can't guess the conservatory unless you roll and walk your ass over to the conservatory.

756
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just think that it's important.

757
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:59,100
Speaker 1: if someone's thinking about worker placement It is useful and worthwhile to think about it in the context of placing physical markers in a shared space.

758
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:17,099
Speaker 1: I think that physicality matters Even though like you can argue a lot of things that don't have any of that Could mathematically be worker placement, but even if you have a game like that, that's why I get back to that first point I feel like it's worthwhile to think of it in those physical terms Or at least describe it in those physical terms.

759
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:27,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know a lot of things, you know, you could somewhat argue right our sort of worker placement Right, like, you know or at least part like.

760
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:29,820
Speaker 0: think about I don't know magic the gathering the everything game, right?

761
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,162
Speaker 0: It's like.

762
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:30,765
Speaker 0: is there any?

763
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:31,147
Speaker 0: there's?

764
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:33,360
Speaker 0: no there's no worker place in a magic the gathering, right?

765
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,564
Speaker 0: But it's like.

766
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:51,060
Speaker 0: well if you can think about your mana as like those are Every mana is a worker and you when you play it, you know, you could either have workers build new cards Which are then themselves actions, right at least if the cards have mana activation costs, right?

767
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,720
Speaker 0: Not creatures wouldn't count right but because creatures could act on their own without workers.

768
00:54:55,741 --> 00:55:02,180
Speaker 0: Yeah But you know you spend two mana and the bill do you send those two workers to the builder area?

769
00:55:02,623 --> 00:55:03,811
Speaker 0: Right the two red mana.

770
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:12,400
Speaker 0: and you summon this You know artifact that has a two mana activation cost and then you move two more of your mana workers onto the artifact.

771
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, take that action, right?

772
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:15,590
Speaker 0: It's like you're.

773
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:28,720
Speaker 0: you know, it's not really a worker placement because You're not playing like on the same actions as the opponent and blocking them Right, and like I said, you can summon creatures that just act on their own, right?

774
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,989
Speaker 0: Not everything has as this worker cost to do things.

775
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,940
Speaker 0: but you can see how like it looks nothing like a worker placement game.

776
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:42,301
Speaker 0: but that aspect of You have a limited resource to take actions with you You're.

777
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:46,860
Speaker 0: what actions you can take are determined by the state of the board, right?

778
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:53,500
Speaker 0: And you allocate your resources of playing to which of the what the actions you will activate in which ones you own.

779
00:55:54,502 --> 00:56:05,391
Speaker 1: So I think if we did like say we did a panel or we went deeper on this topic overall I feel like there's a place for taking a few specific worker placement games and we'd have to play a lot of newer ones.

780
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:16,768
Speaker 0: if anyone people noticing people who know have been listening to this 15 years almost every game we mentioned was designed at least seven years ago Because we basically didn't play.

781
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:23,574
Speaker 0: we stopped playing a lot of worker placement games, you know We sort of played so many of them that we haven't played too many since then.

782
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:28,133
Speaker 0: like crown of Amara is like the lady So good there I think they'll.

783
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:33,176
Speaker 0: actually there was the the Well, we did an episode of those dude imperium and the other one.

784
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:40,579
Speaker 1: Yeah Dude, imperium is listed on this list of worker placement games I pulled up and there's the archaeology one where we're with our next.

785
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:46,779
Speaker 0: they were Yes, they're combining the worker placement with the deck building into sort of a combo deal, right?

786
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:53,420
Speaker 0: And it's like those like the newest ones we played but we've only played those like once or twice each like not enough.

787
00:56:53,884 --> 00:57:03,920
Speaker 0: So if we're gonna do it We had to play a bunch of newer ones to see what more recent Developments are and then part of the panel is just gonna be going over a few not too many.

788
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but just highlighting, you know different aspects.

789
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:14,223
Speaker 0: I feel like you go over a few and then also highlighting the specific strategies for games and then maybe Contrasting.

790
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:18,500
Speaker 0: but like look in this game the strategy to win is this and this they changes one thing.

791
00:57:18,942 --> 00:57:21,130
Speaker 0: And now that the way to win this game is completely different

792
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,412
Speaker 1: I think

793
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:22,215
Speaker 0: as they change the one

794
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:37,614
Speaker 1: along the way me hopefully we can build the beginning of a lexicon similar to how trick-taking games have a very good lexicon of the characteristics of trick-taking games so that once you learn one like Everybody kind of speaks the same language of explaining.

795
00:57:37,674 --> 00:57:38,760
Speaker 1: Oh and this one, you know follow suit.

796
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,899
Speaker 1: There's two Trump's and there's a coalition and like they have this language Trick-taking games don't quite have that language yet.

797
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:53,420
Speaker 1: But most gamers who play board games if you think about it You can start bucketing worker placement games pretty easily based on the kinds of things they include.

798
00:57:53,863 --> 00:57:56,419
Speaker 1: But we don't have a shared language to describe all those things.

799
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,919
Speaker 1: We tend to describe them and not have a word for them.

800
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:07,200
Speaker 1: I don't know if we're gonna be good at making up words for them But I think we can at least start to describe What are the primary types of characteristics of worker placement games?

801
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,968
Speaker 1: If nothing else that'll we'll have to do that ourselves just while trying to write this panel Even if that's not in the panel.

802
00:58:13,988 --> 00:58:19,919
Speaker 1: if that's just what we did to figure out the panel Maybe yeah thinking a lot about worker placement.

803
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,667
Speaker 1: I'm also desperately hungry and I gotta go vote.

804
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:24,701
Speaker 0: So I already voted early.

805
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:34,123
Speaker 1: and often like This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.

806

Speaker 1: So yeah, uh geek nights is back at conventions.

814
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:27,544
Speaker 1: Look forward to our panel games.

815
00:59:27,584 --> 00:59:28,466
Speaker 1: You can't play.

816
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:33,404
Speaker 1: I just have to Because Scott is extra pedantic and weird about panel names.

817
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,050
Speaker 1: Sometimes I know he never listens to this.

818
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:43,585
Speaker 1: He does not want to talk about games that could possibly under extreme circumstances Maybe be played without changing the title.

819
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:44,730
Speaker 1: and I'm not gonna change the title.

820
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,735
Speaker 1: I'm gonna lie to him about the title and he won't notice and it'll be fine.

821
00:59:48,216 --> 00:59:53,572
Speaker 1: But anyway tonight I leave you with Megan Megan.

822
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:57,309
Speaker 1: we need your help, Megan Megan what?

823
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,617
Speaker 1: We need your help Megan.

824
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:01,260
Speaker 1: again.

825
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,892
Speaker 1: all the flutter ponies have been captured Again.

826
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:08,064
Speaker 1: will you come back and help us defeat the people and free our friends?

827
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:09,530
Speaker 0: can't the other ponies help?

828
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,610
Speaker 0: They have also all been captured.

829
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:14,176
Speaker 0: You're the only one who can help Megan.

830
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:17,969
Speaker 1: We need your human mungus brain and dextrous fingers to rescue them.

831
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:26,490
Speaker 0: Okay Hey, nah crap, let the ponies go fuck.

832
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,353
Speaker 0: Are you supposed to be?

833
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:29,019
Speaker 0: No, I said let the ponies go now.
