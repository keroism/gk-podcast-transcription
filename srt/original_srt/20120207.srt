1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,258
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 7th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:12,760
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,662
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:17,130
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, elevator source.

5
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:20,789
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:37,880
Speaker 0: You know, I think ticker tape parades are one of those things that I will never get sick of only because they are so rare that their occasion warrants some manner of celebration.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,680
Speaker 1: Well, if you would, you said you would never get sick of them, but what if they were happened every day?

8
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,979
Speaker 0: Well, one, if they happen every day, good God.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,458
Speaker 1: Then you would get sick of them.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,920
Speaker 0: But I won't because they will never happen that often.

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,498
Speaker 0: That's true.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,380
Speaker 0: One, they're a thing that really in the modern world can only exist in New York.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,380
Speaker 0: I mean, ticker tape implies stock market, even though we no longer use ticker tape for anything.

14
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:02,400
Speaker 1: But we should buy rolls of ticker tape on eBay just to use it in the parade.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,304
Speaker 0: I almost bought.

16
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:06,380
Speaker 0: I was thinking about buying it for the office when I was at my old company.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,700
Speaker 0: Because remember, we were a broker dealer for Wall Street.

18
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:15,580
Speaker 0: There was an old New York Stock Exchange ticker machine like the thing with the glass dome that printed out quotes.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,002
Speaker 0: Yeah.

20
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,740
Speaker 0: And I wanted to hook it up to an Arduino.

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:18,421
Speaker 1: Yeah.

22
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:25,000
Speaker 0: And I didn't do it because it only cost one hundred bucks and like a thousand dollars of freight shipping.

23
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:25,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

24
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 0: But now I'm wealthier and I'm poking around again to see if I can find one and maybe I'll buy someone else's money to buy it.

25
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:34,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll put it on the corporate card, put it in the office and hook it up.

26
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:36,639
Speaker 0: I think that'd be really cool.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,839
Speaker 0: And I think I think my company is hip enough to where they'd be OK with me doing that.

28
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:42,687
Speaker 0: OK, I want to go for it.

29
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:45,360
Speaker 0: But yeah, the Johnson wins the Super Bowl.

30
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,179
Speaker 1: Oh, that every other state you saw.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

32
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:52,480
Speaker 0: But you guys, our state is clearly superior to the Empire State.

33
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:55,980
Speaker 0: We've got not one, not two, but three football teams.

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,440
Speaker 0: And one of them won the Super Bowl.

35
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,878
Speaker 1: The other two suck balls.

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,626
Speaker 1: Yeah.

37
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:05,920
Speaker 0: It was actually a pretty good game, too.

38
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,380
Speaker 0: Like I was impressed.

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,500
Speaker 0: And also, it's worth noting this Super Bowl was just free to watch online.

40
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:15,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, because NBC is not as dumb as the other TV network.

41
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,048
Speaker 0: I would wager I wonder I'd love to.

42
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 0: I can't wait to see all the statistics for like how many people watched it online.

43
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,285
Speaker 1: Oh, we already know that.

44
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:28,400
Speaker 1: for a fact it was the most watched TV program in the history of the world.

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,719
Speaker 0: I think that was due almost entirely to the fact that it was on the Internet for free.

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,682
Speaker 1: Possibly.

47
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:40,400
Speaker 0: Now, I do know what was interesting is that the commercials, you know, the so-called famous Super Bowl commercials are not as crazy as they were not on the Internet stream.

48
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:41,908
Speaker 1: Nope.

49
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,860
Speaker 0: And I bet I don't know.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,200
Speaker 0: I didn't research this for all I know.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,559
Speaker 0: There's some news article explaining why.

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,700
Speaker 0: And I'm just stupid because I didn't research because they sell those ads for different prices.

53
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:57,220
Speaker 0: I'm also betting that the networks refuse to allow it under any conditions because every network knows.

54
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:03,200
Speaker 1: That's not true, because, number one, a lot of those advertisers just put their commercials on their website.

55
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,682
Speaker 0: Oh, they do.

56
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:09,160
Speaker 0: But before the Super Bowl, even until normal people, I think, don't realize this and watch them at the Super Bowl.

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,520
Speaker 1: But that's going to disappear, you know, within a few more years to you can go to NFL dot com such videos and watch all the ads.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:15,822
Speaker 1: True.

59
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,100
Speaker 0: But they specifically were not in the stream.

60
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,680
Speaker 0: Instead, they showed one ad every time.

61
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:21,162
Speaker 1: Yeah.

62
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,629
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, well, two ads.

63
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:24,740
Speaker 1: that if you watch because it's NBC.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,040
Speaker 1: So NBC usually does Sunday Night Football, which is one game a week.

65
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,080
Speaker 1: And that's how I was watching football when we were in Beacon.

66
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,381
Speaker 1: Right.

67
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

68
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:40,080
Speaker 1: And they've been doing that for years and they've always just shown like one or two ads over and over again during the regular commercial breaks on that system.

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,640
Speaker 1: Now, what I really think system the users Sunday Night Football.

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:42,942
Speaker 1: Yeah.

71
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:45,620
Speaker 1: They can't just suddenly change it to show real commercials.

72
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:49,720
Speaker 1: The system can only handle a handful of commercials can't handle.

73
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,979
Speaker 0: Or I wonder what the actual pricing structure is in the back end.

74
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:04,220
Speaker 0: It's definitely different pricing, because I think that the the one supposition I have is that the advertisers didn't want to pay shit to be on the Internet because who cares on the Internet anyway?

75
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:07,520
Speaker 0: And the network was like, got to make money somehow.

76
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:13,380
Speaker 0: So they sold different ads for the Internet demographic, which meant two ads.

77
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:15,140
Speaker 1: I think they were just doing the same.

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,160
Speaker 1: You know, it's big businesses did just have systems and routines.

79
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,088
Speaker 1: They don't change them.

80
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,159
Speaker 1: And here's what's interesting.

81
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,119
Speaker 0: The system was did not work.

82
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:27,860
Speaker 0: So every time it cut to the ads, one, most of the time it would like freak out.

83
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,200
Speaker 0: And I could still see one of those camera angles, like all the extra camera angles we had pointed at the field, just kind of showing what was going on while the ad was happening.

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,521
Speaker 0: Yep.

85
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:40,274
Speaker 0: And to the ad wouldn't play would like get stuck or the the thing would hang for like 30.

86
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:42,300
Speaker 1: so using silver light or they change it to flash yet.

87
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:43,692
Speaker 0: I don't actually know.

88
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:44,280
Speaker 0: I didn't pay attention.

89
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it used to use silver light and then it was flash.

90
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,580
Speaker 1: I think I'm pretty sure it's flash because the last time I watched it, they had all these Adobe ads.

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,189
Speaker 0: It was a 50/50 shot.

92
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,739
Speaker 0: Every ad cycle of the ad even played.

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,221
Speaker 1: Yep.

94
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:57,117
Speaker 0: And but the street, the football stream was perfect, like 100 percent.

95
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:58,753
Speaker 1: Well, you had files, right?

96
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

97
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:03,980
Speaker 0: I thought we were streaming the Super Bowl and the Puppy Bowl simultaneously.

98
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:04,782
Speaker 0: Yeah.

99
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:08,059
Speaker 0: And in a third window, we were watching YouTube videos whenever ads came on.

100
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:09,083
Speaker 1: Yeah.

101
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,300
Speaker 1: I mean, if you don't have files, though, they can eat.

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 1: The quality could get pretty awful.

103
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:15,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I have files.

104
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,162
Speaker 0: That's right.

105
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:16,705
Speaker 0: And you know what?

106
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:19,440
Speaker 0: If you don't have files, that's that's just really sad.

107
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,620
Speaker 0: Unless you're at university, they think this is really happy.

108
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,440
Speaker 1: Even files is shit compared to the real Internet that other people have, like in the Netherlands or people have gigabits.

109
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, except for the fact that all the content is overseas.

110
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:30,912
Speaker 0: So they still have high latency.

111
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:31,620
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,487
Speaker 1: It's so fast.

113
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:33,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's trouble, though.

114
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,020
Speaker 0: I'd love to see you Netherlandsians play Counter-Strike.

115
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,259
Speaker 1: They do on European servers, which there are plenty of.

116
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,562
Speaker 1: Yeah.

117
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:40,900
Speaker 0: Play with me on my server.

118
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:42,534
Speaker 1: They don't want to play on your server.

119
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,783
Speaker 1: No, they don't.

121
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,120
Speaker 0: But yeah, the Super Bowl was good.

122
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,279
Speaker 0: And once again, you know, not to harp on this point.

123
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:54,240
Speaker 0: You nerds who, you know, go out of your way to say, I don't care about sports.

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,700
Speaker 0: The Super Bowl, you're the same as the people who are like, I don't care about Battlestar Galactica.

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,128
Speaker 0: Why is everyone tweeting about it?

126
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:03,080
Speaker 0: Why do you nerds care so much about Battlestar Galactica?

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,900
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like no one's making you like it, even though I can make an argument as to why you should care about it.

128
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,483
Speaker 1: And it's not dumb.

129
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,300
Speaker 1: But I saw so many tweets.

130
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,720
Speaker 1: It was pretty much mostly Twitter.

131
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,460
Speaker 1: People explicitly.

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,840
Speaker 0: What's the demographic of Twitter?

133
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:27,940
Speaker 1: And people I follow on Twitter were explicitly going out of their way to make a tweet to express their dislike, ignorance, distaste or whatever.

134
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,560
Speaker 1: They were like tweets that ranged from all you morons shut up about football.

135
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,491
Speaker 1: And I'm paraphrasing, obviously, to her.

136
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 1: There's some superb owl going on, you know, stuff like that.

137
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,860
Speaker 1: And it's like, listen, no one says no one makes tweets that are like, heard there's some pony shit.

138
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

139
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 0: Listen, you nerds.

140
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:54,780
Speaker 0: It's the same thing every time you rage because someone tweets like, I don't like that game.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,814
Speaker 0: My little pony B.S.

142
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,480
Speaker 0: Nerd, furry, whatever.

143
00:06:58,423 --> 00:06:59,780
Speaker 0: That's exactly what you're doing.

144
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,120
Speaker 1: It's haters gonna hate.

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, that's all it is.

146
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,404
Speaker 1: So stop.

147
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:06,100
Speaker 1: You know, football is a better game, but it seems it's weird.

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,820
Speaker 0: Most video games and board games.

149
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,180
Speaker 1: The thing, the reason this is different, though, is because when nerds hate on other nerd things, right?

150
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Speaker 1: Some guy who likes the Skyrim's hate is like, why is there this pony mod gay pony guys?

151
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,138
Speaker 1: And then, you know, someone who likes Call of Duty is like, man, Counter-Strike, right?

152
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,680
Speaker 1: It's nerds hating nerds on nerdy things.

153
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,680
Speaker 1: So they're all, whenever that happens, nerds recognize that and they go, haters gonna hate.

154
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,100
Speaker 1: But when nerds are all collectively like hating on the sport, like no one's being like haters gonna hate.

155
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:37,318
Speaker 1: They're just being like, yeah, that's OK.

156
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,163
Speaker 1: We all hate that.

157
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:41,380
Speaker 1: And I'm like, no, football's a nerdery, too.

158
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,399
Speaker 1: Those people just aren't talking to you at all.

159
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,040
Speaker 0: Sound body and sound mind are very important.

160
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,703
Speaker 1: That's right.

161
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:49,440
Speaker 1: So, you know, football's the same.

162
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:50,959
Speaker 0: Don't be hating kids.

163
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:52,186
Speaker 0: It's all cool.

164
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,200
Speaker 0: Except for furries, I guess.

165
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,502
Speaker 1: Furries?

166
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,045
Speaker 1: No.

167
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,920
Speaker 0: So I got a bit of a geek bite here.

168
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,927
Speaker 1: A geek bite?

169
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:00,760
Speaker 0: Well, I got a geek bite.

170
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:06,160
Speaker 0: Because, you know, while Scott hates on most games and won't play him.

171
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,938
Speaker 1: Haters gonna hate.

172
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,120
Speaker 0: I actually did buy Deus Ex when it was like $14.99.

173
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,484
Speaker 1: Well, I bought Deus Ex when it was like $2.

174
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:16,759
Speaker 0: Well, the new Deus Ex.

175
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,029
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

176
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,300
Speaker 1: I didn't like the first one.

177
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,500
Speaker 1: Why would I spend $15 on a sequel that became so many years later?

178
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,079
Speaker 0: What didn't you like about the first one?

179
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,040
Speaker 1: It's unplayable.

180
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,054
Speaker 0: In what regard?

181
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:26,440
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

182
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,239
Speaker 1: I couldn't even beat level one.

183
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:31,459
Speaker 1: Even though I tried to beat level one every different possible way.

184
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,599
Speaker 0: So, Scott, I'm going to say this.

185
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:42,039
Speaker 0: There is no reason, unless someone is one of those hardcore people, kind of like how you don't need to go back and play the old Fallouts.

186
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,318
Speaker 0: You just need to know they were there.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,180
Speaker 0: You don't need to go back and play the old Deus Ex.

188
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,219
Speaker 0: You just need to know it was there.

189
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,200
Speaker 1: But the point is, people rave about that game.

190
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,236
Speaker 1: And they're always like, "Oh, man, playing Deus Ex again is so

191
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:51,660
Speaker 1: awesome.".

192
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,328
Speaker 0: Scott, you know what?

193
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:53,360
Speaker 1: They're full of shit.

194
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,859
Speaker 0: I'm going to play the hater game.

195
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,859
Speaker 0: I rave about Mega TF.

196
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:00,732
Speaker 0: Mega Team Fortress.

197
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:01,159
Speaker 0: You know what?

198
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,020
Speaker 0: Compared to modern games, that game sucks.

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,554
Speaker 1: No, we should fucking play that game.

200
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:06,039
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

201
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,300
Speaker 1: It is not unplayable by any means.

202
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,319
Speaker 0: Except to people like us.

203
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,420
Speaker 0: Scott, do you remember how to write a fucking script?

204
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,220
Speaker 1: I was about to say, before you interrupted, do you know how to write a script?

205
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,460
Speaker 1: The only thing the game is lacking is an appropriate control configuration interface.

206
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,120
Speaker 1: If it had that, it would be all set.

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,400
Speaker 0: I think you forget how poor the graphics are in the Quake 1 engine.

208
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,319
Speaker 1: They don't need to be that good.

209
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,480
Speaker 0: They're kind of like how I played Doom.

210
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,939
Speaker 1: Can I tell what class the other guy is?

211
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,659
Speaker 1: Can I fly across the two form without touching the bridge?

212
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,060
Speaker 1: Can I rocket a guy in the face?

213
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,417
Speaker 0: Scott, could you ever actually wall run in Team Fortress?

214
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:44,920
Speaker 0: Mega TF.

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,065
Speaker 1: I could do in Doom 2.

216
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:49,419
Speaker 1: Do they still have the new grenade thingy?

217
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,097
Speaker 0: An Otis?

218
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, Deus Ex Human Revolution.

219
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:56,539
Speaker 0: Don't forget about Deus Ex.

220
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,820
Speaker 0: Just play that game, because it was super fun.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,099
Speaker 0: I got about 27 hours of, well, no.

222
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
Speaker 0: I got 26 hours and 55 minutes of enjoyment out of that game.

223
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:07,319
Speaker 0: It's super fun.

224
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,139
Speaker 0: It's stealth that works really well.

225
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:18,660
Speaker 0: I kind of played the game, I think I talked about this in another episode, as though it was Ghost in the Shell and I was the Major.

226
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:24,379
Speaker 0: So I only ever put upgrades into things that made me better at hacking, sneaking, and butt.

227
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,739
Speaker 0: But in every situation I thought, what would the Major do?

228
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:32,140
Speaker 0: And that made for a really enjoyable experience.

229
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:37,440
Speaker 0: The stealth stuff works, like guys kind of walk around intelligently and there's always a vent.

230
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,800
Speaker 0: And if there is an event, there's always some clever thing you can do.

231
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaker 0: And it's pretty intuitive.

232
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:42,800
Speaker 0: I had almost no difficulty.

233
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,240
Speaker 0: Like one boss fight took me like 10 attempts before I figured out the deal.

234
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:48,900
Speaker 0: I only have one complaint with the game.

235
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,100
Speaker 0: The ending is fucking bullshit.

236
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:54,720
Speaker 0: I was pissed off.

237
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,420
Speaker 1: Are you sure maybe you didn't get the good ending?

238
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,399
Speaker 0: No, I got all the endings.

239
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:00,919
Speaker 0: And you know what?

240
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,319
Speaker 0: The end of the game was so fun.

241
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,840
Speaker 0: You know, games can have crappy endings.

242
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:07,800
Speaker 0: I've lived through that in my life.

243
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,740
Speaker 0: But the ending to Deus Ex Human Revolution was so cheap and so lazy, so hackneyed, so forced, so abrupt.

244
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:21,460
Speaker 0: I was disappointed to the point of a little bit of actual anger.

245
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,239
Speaker 0: I would have rather the game just like crashed and not let me finish than have actually gone through the final end of the game.

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,859
Speaker 1: Was it the actual play ending or just like the video at the end?

247
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:38,927
Speaker 0: So, the final sequence at the end when you're on this like Arctic base is pretty- Spoilers.

248
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,320
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,605
Speaker 0: You know what?

250
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:42,480
Speaker 0: You want some other spoilers?

251
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:43,459
Speaker 0: There's vents.

252
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:46,860
Speaker 0: You sneak through them and you jump down behind guys and you punch them in the face.

253
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,700
Speaker 0: So, there's this awesome end sequence.

254
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:55,860
Speaker 0: One, I heard Dave Riley and a bunch of people talk about how the end of Deus Ex was four buttons.

255
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:01,760
Speaker 0: Kind of like how Fallout 3 had the "Do you save everybody or are you a jerk" ending.

256
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,837
Speaker 0: So, people kept saying, "Yeah, it's a four button

257
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:05,119
Speaker 0: ending.".

258
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,880
Speaker 0: Like, kick a puppy, save a puppy, eat a puppy, leave the puppy to fend for himself like a little brother.

259
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:18,000
Speaker 0: I did not expect that they were not making a metaphor that it was literally four buttons.

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,520
Speaker 0: That literally, after you beat the final boss, the game walks you into a room and you're standing there and there's an FMV.

261
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,775
Speaker 0: And a character says, "Well, you've won, blah blah blah.

262
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:29,840
Speaker 0: Now what do you

263
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:29,900
Speaker 0: do?".

264
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,695
Speaker 1: They actually say, "Well, you've

265
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:30,878
Speaker 1: won.".

266
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,440
Speaker 1: Basically.

267
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:44,050
Speaker 0: She says something like, "If you want to tell the world what happened here, knowing full well that they'll probably abandon science and technology forever, press this

268
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:44,476
Speaker 0: button.".

269
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:47,840
Speaker 0: And then a little button door opens up and there's a button.

270
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:57,833
Speaker 0: "If you think you should just fucking burn this place down, kill yourself and everyone in the facility to let mankind choose on their own, press this other

271
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:58,219
Speaker 0: button.".

272
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:00,117
Speaker 0: And then another button opens up.

273
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:06,300
Speaker 0: And those are the only options you get unless you do some bullshit and find some people in the last stage.

274
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:08,740
Speaker 0: Then you get two other options.

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,340
Speaker 0: But one, the options don't make any goddamn sense.

276
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:20,040
Speaker 0: I did not like any of them and I could think of a thousand better options that the character could have actually done in the real story.

277
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,578
Speaker 0: So the end made no sense.

278
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:25,100
Speaker 0: Two, there's no difference between any of the endings.

279
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:27,220
Speaker 0: There's no epilogue.

280
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:29,000
Speaker 0: There's a million open threads.

281
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,100
Speaker 0: You get nothing.

282
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,940
Speaker 0: No matter which button you click, you get a four minute or so kind of video of the real world.

283
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:44,140
Speaker 0: And depending on what ending you click, which button you click, you get a different order of the scenes in the video and a different voiceover.

284
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,598
Speaker 0: But the voiceovers all boil down to the same thing.

285
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,427
Speaker 0: "What is humanity?

286
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,240
Speaker 0: What does it mean to be a human?

287
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:53,580
Speaker 0: Are we really capable of harnessing this sort of technology?

288
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,337
Speaker 0: What if people abuse it?

289
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,972
Speaker 0: Have people ever abused

290
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:57,658
Speaker 0: technology?".

291
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,700
Speaker 0: With these cliche images of Nazis and atomic bombs.

292
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,968
Speaker 1: "Me and play

293
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:02,996
Speaker 1: gods!".

294
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,679
Speaker 0: And then, that's it!

295
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:08,180
Speaker 0: You don't even get to see the results of your decision.

296
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,060
Speaker 0: You get the same vague bullshit, half-assed bullshit.

297
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,150
Speaker 1: "You and play

298
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:12,677
Speaker 1: gods."

299
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:13,524
Speaker 1: And you know what?

300
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:16,120
Speaker 1: This is why I don't care about story in fucking games.

301
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,480
Speaker 1: I just care about the actual game.

302
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,419
Speaker 0: The story was good.

303
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,400
Speaker 0: Other than, there's one, I'm gonna get another spoiler.

304
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,020
Speaker 1: If the story's so good, I'll just watch it on YouTube.

305
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,820
Speaker 1: I only want to play a game if the game is worth playing.

306
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,000
Speaker 0: Yes, the game is worth playing.

307
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,659
Speaker 0: Same story.

308
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,640
Speaker 0: But at the same time, the story was revealed in interesting ways throughout the game.

309
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,920
Speaker 0: Mostly in the course of actual contextual play.

310
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,543
Speaker 0: Much like Half-Life 2.

311
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,519
Speaker 1: But apparently not at the end.

312
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:39,199
Speaker 0: Everything except the end, yeah.

313
00:14:39,780 --> 00:15:04,099
Speaker 0: The end was just... And the thing is, all they would have had to do to do a 180 on that bullshit was to just, instead of doing that kind of existential, half-assed, no-answer BS where all the endings are the same, if they'd just given me a denouement, if the ending for each of the buttons had been just a 10 years later video, like, "What the world is like 10 years later after you did X," that would have been fine.

314
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,560
Speaker 0: That would have been awesome, in fact.

315
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:05,976
Speaker 0: But no.

316
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,460
Speaker 0: You get nothing.

317
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:08,957
Speaker 1: Anyway.

318
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,697
Speaker 0: Otherwise, the game is stupid.

319
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:10,960
Speaker 0: fine.

320
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,879
Speaker 1: If you want to play a good stealth game...

321
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,840
Speaker 0: Play Deus Ex Human Revolution?

322
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,860
Speaker 1: You can go to GOG.com and they have...

323
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:17,760
Speaker 0: Or play Metal Gear.

324
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,220
Speaker 1: They have Thief Gold and Thief 2, the only real stealth games I've ever played in my life.

325
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,660
Speaker 1: They are both now available at GOG.com with no DRMs.

326
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,719
Speaker 0: We've never done a show on Thief, have we?

327
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,572
Speaker 1: I got Thief Gold.

328
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:29,580
Speaker 1: I didn't get Thief 2 yet.

329
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:32,439
Speaker 0: I have a copy of Thief 3 that came with my video card a long time ago.

330
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,180
Speaker 0: Thief 3 was okay.

331
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,718
Speaker 1: And I started playing Thief Gold, and you know what?

332
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:43,500
Speaker 1: Still fucking a real stealth game where actually stealthiness works and it's awesome and it's a good game.

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,000
Speaker 0: Scott, you should play Human Revolution because the stealth works and is awesome.

334
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,059
Speaker 1: Maybe if it's a dollar.

335
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:48,771
Speaker 0: Yeah.

336
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,160
Speaker 0: But seriously, the stealth really works well.

337
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:52,720
Speaker 0: Simple stuff matters.

338
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,699
Speaker 0: Doors being open or closed and distance and all the sounds you make actually...

339
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,960
Speaker 1: You mean the same as Thief 1?

340
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a lot like Thief 1.

341
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,154
Speaker 1: Even though Thief 1 got it right 100 years ago.

342
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,440
Speaker 1: So another game also got it right.

343
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:06,040
Speaker 1: So it did the exact same thing.

344
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,360
Speaker 1: If it's a new game, it needs to be much more advanced.

345
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,897
Speaker 1: It's like, "Yeah, I got it right.

346
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:11,300
Speaker 1: Great.

347
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,975
Speaker 1: You did the same thing that they did in the 90s.

348
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,264
Speaker 1: Good for you.

349
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:15,835
Speaker 1: You made no advancement or improvement

350
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:16,339
Speaker 1: whatsoever.".

351
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,779
Speaker 0: I think you're being a little too black and white and dismissive here.

352
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,411
Speaker 0: Fuck Scott and haters, Deus Ex.

353
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:21,440
Speaker 0: Human Revolution is super fun.

354
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,219
Speaker 0: However, at the end, once you beat the last boss, just turn the game off.

355
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,620
Speaker 0: Don't even click.

356
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,400
Speaker 0: Don't even give the game the pleasure of picking any of its BS endings.

357
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,360
Speaker 0: Just watch them on YouTube.

358
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:43,140
Speaker 0: Also, I'm disappointed, spoilers, that four-fifths of the way through the game, one of the bosses is like, "Oh man, I'm just a pawn in a greater game.

359
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,213
Speaker 0: It's actually the

360
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:44,640
Speaker 0: Illuminati.".

361
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:47,140
Speaker 0: And the main character is like, "Illuminati?

362
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

363
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,071
Speaker 0: It's actually the

364
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,678
Speaker 0: Illuminati.".

365
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:51,259
Speaker 1: Great.

366
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was not pleased with that either.

367
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:54,354
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

368
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

369
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Speaker 1: Who cares?

370
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,620
Speaker 0: Spoilers, this is Robocop Ghost in the Shell the game.

371
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,080
Speaker 0: Who cares?

372
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,260
Speaker 1: So here's a real game news, right?

373
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,038
Speaker 1: This is a geekery that I'm sort of not in and I never will be in, but I know it exists and I respect it.

374
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,699
Speaker 1: And that is the flight simulation geekery.

375
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:14,240
Speaker 1: And there are many levels.

376
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,199
Speaker 1: There are people who just go wee with a flight stick and they fly around.

377
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:22,386
Speaker 1: And then there's people who are like pretending to be air traffic controllers using Skype and whatever it is.

378
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:25,920
Speaker 1: they got to actually control people who are simulating flying.

379
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:27,638
Speaker 1: And there'll be people copiloting.

380
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:31,759
Speaker 1: I think there might even be people simulating being stewardesses.

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,480
Speaker 1: Handing out drinks, right?

382
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,040
Speaker 1: I don't know what these people are doing.

383
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,840
Speaker 1: But they love flight simulating.

384
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,700
Speaker 1: And they got a lot of softwares they use.

385
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,940
Speaker 1: Isn't X-Plane the free open source one or something?

386
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:45,599
Speaker 1: And there's another one that's the expensive one.

387
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,299
Speaker 1: But anyway, I remember back in the day it was all about Microsoft Flight Simulator on MS-DOS.

388
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,539
Speaker 0: Because it came with your computer, you just had it.

389
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,459
Speaker 1: And that was something that Microsoft kept going.

390
00:17:57,005 --> 00:18:02,059
Speaker 1: You know, they had other things in that line like Microsoft Golf, which is a golf simulator but that didn't, you know, that died.

391
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:03,840
Speaker 1: But they kept going with Flight Simulator.

392
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,039
Speaker 1: I think they actually had Flight Simulator X. I think they had like a ton of versions of it.

393
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,059
Speaker 1: But then it sort of died.

394
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,900
Speaker 1: But now they're coming out with Microsoft Flight.

395
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:13,680
Speaker 1: Not Flight Simulator, just Microsoft Flight.

396
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:18,319
Speaker 1: And it's going to come out on February 29th at the end of the month, the leap day.

397
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,119
Speaker 1: And it's going to be free.

398
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,350
Speaker 1: Not free like, you know, the free to play, but you can't actually play, you know, it's really free.

399
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,620
Speaker 1: And the only thing they're charging money for is like, add a plane.

400
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,499
Speaker 1: Add the rest of Hawaii.

401
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,068
Speaker 1: Add, you know, stuff like that.

402
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:41,806
Speaker 1: And it's like if you just want to, you know, the free area gives you a bunch of planes and a bunch of places to fly.

403
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:49,560
Speaker 1: And if you don't really- The important thing is- If you don't want to fly a particular edition of a particular airplane on the extra Hawaiian Islands- The Beegee better be in there.

404
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,224
Speaker 1: Right.

405
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:52,228
Speaker 0: You don't- The Beegee's a pretty good plane.

406
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:53,664
Speaker 1: You don't need to pay any extra money.

407
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:57,947
Speaker 1: And you know what, if you're really crazy about it, it's actually not crazy expensive.

408
00:18:57,987 --> 00:19:00,695
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, you can get the Hawaiian Adventure Pack for 20 bucks.

409
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,392
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, okay.

410
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:03,927
Speaker 0: I was really into flight simulators.

411
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:07,465
Speaker 1: It's a lot more going to be like that train thing that's on Steam.

412
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:08,111
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:11,526
Speaker 0: Which again, if I could get that and all its DLC for like a dollar, I'd buy it.

414
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:17,725
Speaker 1: But I mean, for free, for a game that you just play locally, really, I'm definitely going to at least try it.

415
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,233
Speaker 1: I'm not going to get a stick or anything, but I'll use my mouse and keyboard and fly around and see what happens.

416
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:29,849
Speaker 0: I would need a stick because I was really into flight simulators back when I was a kid, and I was seriously courting the idea of getting a pilot's license.

417
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:33,243
Speaker 1: I'm not going to do it for series, but I'll try it for free for a few minutes.

418
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:33,769
Speaker 1: Why not?

419
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:34,700
Speaker 0: I'll let you in on a secret.

420
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,600
Speaker 0: Flying planes is actually- Boring.

421
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,780
Speaker 0: Really easy and boring for the most part.

422
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,760
Speaker 0: Unless you're in an ultralight or something.

423
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,572
Speaker 1: But anyway, it exists.

424
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,679
Speaker 1: And it's pretty cool.

425
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,930
Speaker 0: It's a thing.

426
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,263
Speaker 0: So one other piece of gaming news.

427
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:55,140
Speaker 0: There were rumors this was going along for a while, but I didn't- I ignored it because Gamefly, who cares, and Direct-to-Drive, who cares?

428
00:19:55,763 --> 00:20:04,351
Speaker 0: And then I was cleaning out my inbox and I found an email I never noticed where Direct-to-Drive was like, "Yeah, we got bought by Gamefly, and you can't download your games anymore.

429
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:05,240
Speaker 0: Now you have a Gamefly

430
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:06,811
Speaker 0: account.".

431
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,755
Speaker 0: So I was like, "Wait a minute.

432
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:09,790
Speaker 0: Why would they email-".

433
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:10,398
Speaker 0: Oh no!

434
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:13,484
Speaker 0: I bought a Direct-to-Drive game, like, forever ago.

435
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,179
Speaker 0: I bought Bionic Commando Rearmed.

436
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:19,018
Speaker 0: And sure enough, I cannot download it from Direct-to-Drive.

437
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:19,503
Speaker 0: They're gone.

438
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:27,869
Speaker 0: I also can't download it from Gamefly, because they haven't migrated their whole catalog yet and they've refused to give an ETA and when they will.

439
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:35,920
Speaker 0: Two, I don't think they're actually going to migrate Bionic Commando Rearmed, because it doesn't even show up in their normal catalog.

440
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:40,996
Speaker 0: And this just reiterates, one, fuck you, Gamefly.

441
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:46,655
Speaker 0: I only have an account because I'm trying to get my one game that I legally own downloaded from your bullshit.

442
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:47,564
Speaker 0: So far I can't.

443
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:48,656
Speaker 0: Your customer service has been worthless.

444
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:54,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many stories do we need of, "Fucked by DRM, pirates get better service than people who pay money, blah blah

445
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:54,719
Speaker 1: blah.".

446
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,820
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the same story over and over again.

447
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,224
Speaker 0: Why repeat it?

448
00:20:57,244 --> 00:21:00,680
Speaker 0: But now I got fucked by it, so really- Why repeat the story?

449
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:06,740
Speaker 0: This is why I never buy any game that isn't on Steam.

450
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:08,920
Speaker 1: Steam has the same problem, though.

451
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,332
Speaker 1: They're DRM'd and closed, but we can trust them not to fuck up.

452
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,746
Speaker 0: No, there's two reasons.

453
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:18,135
Speaker 0: One, I trust them to do the right thing if they have to, or they're forced into a weird situation.

454
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:27,000
Speaker 0: Two, so many people rely on Steam, I am confident that if Steam went away or turned evil, that shit would be cracked right away.

455
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:28,796
Speaker 0: Yeah.

456
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,939
Speaker 0: But, uh, yeah, who even uses Gamefly?

457
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,639
Speaker 1: There are people who use it actually for the game renting service, where they mail you discs.

458
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,899
Speaker 0: Oh, I used to use Red Octane for that, which was actually send me a PS1 disc that I copied and immediately mailed back that day.

459
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:45,079
Speaker 1: Right, but here's the thing, what's gonna happen?

460
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:50,634
Speaker 1: uh, there's rumors going around about the Xbox 720 and how it won't let you use used games.

461
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:56,190
Speaker 1: Oh, we've known this for a long time, the entire media industry- But it's like, well, first of all, Steam already doesn't let you use used games.

462
00:21:56,251 --> 00:22:01,503
Speaker 1: Two, I don't have any Xbox games that are on a disc except Rock Pan 3 and the ones that came with it.

463
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:02,453
Speaker 1: Oh, and Street Fighter.

464
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:03,059
Speaker 1: That's it.

465
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:06,696
Speaker 1: Uh, it's like I'm probably not gonna buy any more disc games ever.

466
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,482
Speaker 0: I'm not even renewing Xbox Live Gold, 'cause I don't fuckin' use it.

467
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:09,866
Speaker 1: Me either.

468
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:12,999
Speaker 1: Right, it's like I'm not buying a disc game, pretty much ever.

469
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:39,299
Speaker 1: All the best games are download games that I can't sell used anyway, but even more interesting there was some court case I read about on Slashdot, where there was some company where what they were doing, I think it's called Re-Digi, and it's like you sell your used iTunes music to other people, and they have some clever way where it removes the song from your iTunes account and deletes it so you can never have the song again, and it gives it to the other person.

470
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:49,559
Speaker 1: And so you can, it's like, I don't know what kind of crack they're doing, but they have a thing where you can sell your used, legally purchased iTunes music to other people with your writer for a sale.

471
00:22:50,563 --> 00:23:00,347
Speaker 1: And, uh, it's gonna be, and the court was like, yeah, okay, and it seemed there was a slight, tiny bit of momentum going in the direction of the, uh, the people who were, you know, doing this, so.

472
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:01,640
Speaker 0: That'll be interesting.

473
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:04,382
Speaker 1: It's gonna be interesting to see what goes on here.

474
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:11,956
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

475
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,209
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

476
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,240
Speaker 1: So, I actually, I'm gonna do my own thing.

477
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,019
Speaker 1: That's right, I did-- Master Batari!

478
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:23,439
Speaker 1: I did something that is so awesome, that it is a thing of the day.

479
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:28,520
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna pick it, 'cause I did something and I think that I'm awesome enough to be a thing of the day.

480
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:29,854
Speaker 0: Uh, you know what, I agree.

481
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,007
Speaker 0: I think it's a great idea.

482
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:35,899
Speaker 1: So I made a Tumblr, and I'm not replacing my blog with a Tumblr or anything like that, right?

483
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:43,160
Speaker 1: I just made this Tumblr for one specific purpose, and that is a Tumblr consisting only of video game meat.

484
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 1: That's it.

485
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,136
Speaker 1: Meats from video games.

486
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:53,795
Speaker 1: It's pixelmeat.tumblr.com and, uh, I got, every day, I got a JPEG or something of a meat from a video game.

487
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:58,080
Speaker 1: Like, we're gonna have mostly Castlevania going on here, but for now, we got some variety.

488
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:05,085
Speaker 1: Uh, if you know of any video game meats that I have not yet covered, please send them in, 'cause I don't wanna run out.

489
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:06,680
Speaker 0: Well's drying up fast, surprisingly.

490
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, you know, it's not really drying up.

491
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,650
Speaker 0: The Dungeons and Dragons game and/or Golden Axe.

492
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,286
Speaker 1: I thought of those already.

493
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:18,100
Speaker 1: They're already, I have a list, but I've already thought of the Dungeons and Dragons arcade games and the Golden Axe.

494
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,435
Speaker 0: I already got Gauntlet on there.

495
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,043
Speaker 1: I'm sure, the thing is, there are multiple Gauntlet meats I can go for, but here's the one I've already got, is the one with the plate and the beer next to it.

496
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:27,973
Speaker 0: That's my favorite one.

497
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:28,580
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

498
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, you love to shoot it.

499
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:34,839
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, if you know any video game meats, please send them in.

500
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,165
Speaker 1: There's a submit button on the side that says submit meat.

501
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:38,980
Speaker 1: Uh, submit your meat.

502
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:51,972
Speaker 0: So, thanks to My Little Pony, I discovered a genre of music that I guess I could've extrapolated, but I never thought about it, 'cause I'm a big fan of swing, and I'm a big fan of big band and stuff like that.

503
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:56,480
Speaker 0: I'm really a big, like, the Squirrel Nut Zippers were actually one of my favorite bands, like when I was younger.

504
00:24:57,422 --> 00:25:05,746
Speaker 0: And, I never thought to combine that with techno, because half the genres of music out there are... Yeah, take genre X, turn it into techno.

505
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:20,495
Speaker 0: I never thought to do a swing, and apparently there's a huge genre of music called electro swing, and someone made a PMV to a song by a band called Caravan Paradise called Clash, and the PMV was awesome.

506
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:21,525
Speaker 0: The song was awesome.

507
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:30,674
Speaker 0: So, I searched for them, and I find their normal video, well, I guess the link to the actual full-length song, and it's all pony comments there.

508
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:38,391
Speaker 0: The band, this Parisian band, was catapulted to American fame due to My Little Pony, and they're fucking awesome.

509
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:39,948
Speaker 0: This is a great song.

510
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:40,797
Speaker 0: It's been stuck in my head.

511
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,847
Speaker 0: I've been playing it, like, every ten minutes for the last two days.

512
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:45,869
Speaker 0: We'll see how long it takes me to get sick of it.

513
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:46,639
Speaker 0: I found them on Spotify.

514
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:48,110
Speaker 0: I found all those other bands.

515
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:49,493
Speaker 0: I am totally pumped about this.

516
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:53,686
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, PAX East is coming up.

517
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,651
Speaker 0: If you didn't get a ticket, well, we told you.

518
00:25:56,896 --> 00:26:02,571
Speaker 0: You can buy three stupid one-day badges, but if it's not too late, you can take up the black and/or the blue.

519
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:05,260
Speaker 1: They shouldn't even sell the stupid one-day badges anymore.

520
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,844
Speaker 1: They shouldn't.

521
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:06,653
Speaker 1: Three-day only.

522
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,460
Speaker 0: You could try to be an enforcer, but otherwise, you're not going.

523
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,006
Speaker 0: And you know what?

524
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,999
Speaker 0: If you don't have hotel room, good luck staying by the Hines.

525
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, where Anime Boston is.

526
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we will be at PAX.

527
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:21,180
Speaker 0: We will also, very likely, as long as we can work out the scheduling between the two, be at Anime Boston.

528
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:22,269
Speaker 1: For at least a little bit.

529
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:22,652
Speaker 0: Yep.

530
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:26,188
Speaker 0: Probably around dinner times, we're trying to work out a deal.

531
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:35,300
Speaker 0: Well, we kind of did work out a deal where, if we're going to be at Anime Boston, it's going to be around dinner time, so we can get away from the horde of PAX and eat on Newbury Street.

532
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:36,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, where the good food is.

533
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:40,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I love PAX, and the BCEC has some good restaurants, but not enough of them.

534
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:45,239
Speaker 1: But the thing is, right, Anime Boston usually, you know, tries to give us money that we don't need.

535
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,703
Speaker 1: Instead, if they pay for cabs, it'll be about less money than that.

536
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:52,530
Speaker 0: I don't want any of that, as long as I can, I have an excuse.

537
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:59,099
Speaker 1: But I'm worried about speed because I want to get back to PAX after Anime Boston and dinner, so that we can then play games.

538
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:00,470
Speaker 0: Yep.

539
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,179
Speaker 0: I'm super pumped.

540
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,714
Speaker 0: KineticCon, coming along, look for the website soon-ish for panels and missions and all that.

541
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:09,199
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

542
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,448
Speaker 0: Check out our YouTube.

543
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:11,499
Speaker 0: Check out all our stuff.

544
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:12,728
Speaker 0: We got stuff.

545
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:15,759
Speaker 0: We played with our friend Chase and some other people.

546
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:20,568
Speaker 0: A game that brought us up to 28 randomized floors to stop on.

547
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,547
Speaker 0: A thrilling co-op experience.

548
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,810
Speaker 0: Realistic elevator physics.

549
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,119
Speaker 0: Cunning, state of the art AI that really goes into the elevator and waits.

550
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,359
Speaker 0: And real moral choices.

551
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,590
Speaker 0: What floor do you get off?

552
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:34,185
Speaker 0: Do you ever get off?

553
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:40,226
Speaker 0: We played a mod for Half-Life 2 called Elevator Source.

554
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,279
Speaker 0: We actually played it.

555
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,611
Speaker 1: It was a recent thing of the day.

556
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:44,286
Speaker 1: We played it once through.

557
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:45,799
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

558
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:47,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'll talk about it.

559
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:48,918
Speaker 1: It's worth doing once.

560
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:50,387
Speaker 0: Here's the key.

561
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:51,980
Speaker 0: Don't do it by yourself.

562
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:55,840
Speaker 0: What you gotta do is get a bunch of friends, like at least three.

563
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,129
Speaker 1: Who've never done it before.

564
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:58,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, who have no idea what this is.

565
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,748
Speaker 0: Get them to install... You gotta have Gary's mod.

566
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:02,200
Speaker 0: You gotta have Half-Life and the episodes.

567
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:04,360
Speaker 0: Half-Life 2, obviously.

568
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,099
Speaker 0: And the episodes.

569
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:07,860
Speaker 0: And install this mod.

570
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,060
Speaker 0: Pretty straightforward to install.

571
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:10,509
Speaker 0: Start a server.

572
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:11,399
Speaker 0: Everyone joins it.

573
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:18,260
Speaker 0: Set all talk to true so you can all chat with each other because the key is to be able to talk with voices while you're playing.

574
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:20,868
Speaker 0: And the game is just.

575
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,820
Speaker 0: you're in an elevator.

576
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,867
Speaker 0: Shit happens.

577
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:24,989
Speaker 1: I mean you don't really do anything, right?

578
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,020
Speaker 1: It's like basically the way it works.

579
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:29,272
Speaker 1: you join the server and you all start in this lobby, right?

580
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:33,900
Speaker 1: And you know if you're standing there and if you get in the elevator the game will start.

581
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,129
Speaker 1: So pretty much no one gets in the elevator until everyone's there.

582
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,644
Speaker 1: Then you all get in the elevator together.

583
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:42,179
Speaker 1: Then the elevator just goes on its own and it stops at floors.

584
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,419
Speaker 1: And on each floor something happens.

585
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:47,816
Speaker 1: And you react to it because it's totally unexpected.

586
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:49,493
Speaker 1: And some of them are really creative.

587
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:50,120
Speaker 1: Things happen.

588
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,200
Speaker 0: Some of them were really creepy actually.

589
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,410
Speaker 1: Some of them were creepy.

590
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,319
Speaker 1: A lot of different things going on there.

591
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:57,313
Speaker 1: Some people get in the elevator.

592
00:28:57,353 --> 00:28:58,766
Speaker 1: Some people leave the elevator.

593
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:04,100
Speaker 1: A lot of stuff goes on and it's just about reacting to this crazy shit that happens with your group of people.

594
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,272
Speaker 0: Now what's funny is this is we always talk about games.

595
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:10,260
Speaker 1: The definition is you can't even leave the elevator or do anything.

596
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:11,692
Speaker 1: There's nothing to play.

597
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:12,500
Speaker 1: There's nothing to shoot.

598
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,331
Speaker 0: We use a series of meaningful and/or interesting decisions.

599
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:19,799
Speaker 0: Or we use a competitive fair test of one or more skills among more than one player.

600
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:21,634
Speaker 0: Or maybe even one player.

601
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:22,100
Speaker 0: Depending.

602
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,369
Speaker 0: But there's that third definition of an enjoyable pastime.

603
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,573
Speaker 0: Because this game is in that third group.

604
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:28,140
Speaker 0: It's not.

605
00:29:28,864 --> 00:29:29,699
Speaker 0: there's no skill.

606
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,079
Speaker 0: There's no real decisions to be made.

607
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:34,800
Speaker 0: It's pretty much an experience.

608
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,694
Speaker 0: A shared experience that is minimally interactive.

609
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,038
Speaker 0: But it's an exploratory one.

610
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,340
Speaker 0: Like the first thing you do is you start hitting all your buttons.

611
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,624
Speaker 0: And like you hit a certain button, your guy coughs.

612
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,129
Speaker 0: Like I'm on an elevator and I coughed.

613
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,786
Speaker 0: Hit another button and you check your watch and there's little details.

614
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,190
Speaker 0: Like the watch is accurate to the current real time.

615
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:53,574
Speaker 1: Yup.

616
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,534
Speaker 1: At least in your time zone.

617
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:01,271
Speaker 1: But yeah it's almost like a role playing game where you're being railroaded and you can't get off the tracks.

618
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:08,120
Speaker 0: So you start to follow these characters and I bet you'll find, we're not going to spoil too much, but we'll spoil a few things.

619
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,800
Speaker 0: just to give you an idea of what this is like.

620
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,009
Speaker 0: Like at one floor it stops.

621
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:17,739
Speaker 0: There's this guy just kind of walks on to the elevator and starts waiting with us.

622
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,120
Speaker 1: Every time he plays it's going to be different too because I think it chooses the next floor randomly.

623
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,970
Speaker 1: Yup.

624
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,548
Speaker 1: And so you never know.

625
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,219
Speaker 0: This guy had a name.

626
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,173
Speaker 0: You look at him and he's got a name.

627
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:27,980
Speaker 0: He's just standing there.

628
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,995
Speaker 0: So of course everyone walks over to him coughs on him.

629
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,525
Speaker 0: And then again he walks around him in a circle for a while.

630
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:39,352
Speaker 0: I love the guy who got on later with the shotgun and just kind of kept looking at us warily the whole time.

631
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:40,100
Speaker 1: Never shot anything.

632
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,575
Speaker 0: I was waiting for him to just fucking shoot us.

633
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:41,919
Speaker 1: Yeah.

634
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:49,398
Speaker 0: Like I really don't want to spoil because there's not that much to this game but I will say this.

635
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,930
Speaker 1: We didn't even see all the floors.

636
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,980
Speaker 1: There's plenty of floors we didn't see.

637
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,564
Speaker 0: But it's exploratory in that at some point you eventually do get to get off the elevator.

638
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:07,029
Speaker 0: And what's interesting is that this is where you see this kind of exploratory gameplay really shining even though it doesn't fit the usual definitions of game that we use when we're talking about games we like or are good.

639
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:14,649
Speaker 0: You'll hear things like as soon as you can get off the elevator everyone fucking runs and is just like running around like oh my god look at this.

640
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:15,357
Speaker 0: Oh my god look at this.

641
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,626
Speaker 1: Because you've been stuck in this elevator and you couldn't do anything.

642
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:22,384
Speaker 1: Suddenly you're in a place where you might be able to do something and look around.

643
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:23,011
Speaker 1: so you're just like oh.

644
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:23,760
Speaker 0: finally oh my god.

645
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,089
Speaker 0: Like I hear Chase in one corner is like oh my god check out this skull.

646
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,544
Speaker 0: Oh wait I can pick it up.

647
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,525
Speaker 0: And meanwhile I'm in another room.

648
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:31,616
Speaker 0: I'm like there's a slot machine.

649
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:32,545
Speaker 0: Guys it works.

650
00:31:32,969 --> 00:31:33,756
Speaker 0: Oh my god I'm playing.

651
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:35,595
Speaker 0: And there's a pool table and a blender.

652
00:31:35,615 --> 00:31:41,047
Speaker 0: I went to the fridge and got like an orange out and blended it and lots of fun stuff was going on.

653
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,785
Speaker 1: Even though that stuff is you know if you think about it okay.

654
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:45,633
Speaker 0: It's really lame.

655
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,472
Speaker 1: Blending an orange is pretty lame but.

656
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:52,100
Speaker 0: It feels like one of those like old Quake 2 mods or something like a machinima almost.

657
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:59,079
Speaker 0: There's not much going on but sharing that experience with other people it shows that you know Scott and I are pretty fucking jaded.

658
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,584
Speaker 0: Where you know this game didn't do anything new.

659
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:16,740
Speaker 0: but it proves that a well executed simple concept even if it's just a retread of existing known ideas can still instill in someone that childlike wonder of oh my god I got the pool table to do something.

660
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,891
Speaker 0: this is so awesome.

661
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:20,093
Speaker 1: I pushed a button and a thing happened.

662
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:23,083
Speaker 1: You know it's like the oldest you know amusements in the world.

663
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,548
Speaker 1: Or walk up to a thing push a button and a thing happens.

664
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:39,665
Speaker 0: And part of it too is that you're so constrained that you know you're on the elevator for a while between floors and you pretty much explore and start to like examine every tiny god damn detail in this entire game.

665
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:42,335
Speaker 0: Like you will start examining like the buttons.

666
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:48,040
Speaker 0: You'll be hitting every button on your keyboard you'll like duck and look at every object from every possible angle.

667
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,196
Speaker 0: And you've got to have a bunch of people and you've got to play it together.

668
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:53,347
Speaker 0: You've got to have the shared experience.

669
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:54,276
Speaker 0: You've got to have voice chat.

670
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:55,960
Speaker 0: You've all got to be engaged.

671
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,337
Speaker 0: And I think everyone should play it.

672
00:32:58,397 --> 00:33:01,659
Speaker 0: The only problem is you've got to own Garry's Mod which if you don't it's like 10 bucks.

673
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,159
Speaker 0: I don't know if this experience is worth 10 bucks.

674
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:09,179
Speaker 1: No but if you use Garry's Mod for other shit it might be worth 10 bucks.

675
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:09,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

676
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:20,204
Speaker 1: But actually I was thinking you know it's really similar to those things where you know you get in one of those like those amusement park rides where you sit and it drives you around.

677
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:22,609
Speaker 0: And you shoot at like the pirate and he goes wah wah wah.

678
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:27,520
Speaker 1: Yeah it's like you just see stuff but if you shoot a thing then it doesn't you know then it does something.

679
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,932
Speaker 1: So it's like there'll be a barrel and you shoot the barrel and a pirate comes out and goes argh.

680
00:33:30,952 --> 00:33:31,700
Speaker 0: It's basically that.

681
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,527
Speaker 1: It's basically that.

682
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:35,739
Speaker 1: And maybe we should make one of those in Garry's Mod.

683
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:47,275
Speaker 1: you know where you get in a car and you get in a tram because Half Life loves trams and you sit in it and everyone has a gun and all you can do is shoot at things outside the tram and if you hit a thing you know it does something.

684
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:52,664
Speaker 0: This game also falls into that category much like Passage or Covetous.

685
00:33:53,253 --> 00:34:01,452
Speaker 0: These games that are like they bridge the line between an interactive game and an interactive art installation.

686
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:09,659
Speaker 0: Like this is more installation than a game but yet it kind of proves that the line is not nearly as well defined as a lot of people would like to lead you to believe.

687
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:15,091
Speaker 0: And it is really telling how much we enjoyed it despite the fact that it pretty much does.

688
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:17,319
Speaker 0: everything that we say is shitty about games.

689
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,659
Speaker 1: Well you know it's not.

690
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:29,094
Speaker 1: I wasn't going into it expecting a competitive battle for who can win the elevator because if that had happened if there was some sort of win the elevator I would have ripped all your motherfucking throats out.

691
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:36,219
Speaker 0: Oh my god this game could have done more and Ben it would have gone from a really interesting experience to transcendence.

692
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,574
Speaker 1: See that's what I would have done.

693
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:48,346
Speaker 1: to add more I would have had like you know the same sort of weird build up and then some sort of thing like maybe you're split up and it's like I don't see you guys I still see you guys you know some confusion you know.

694
00:34:48,406 --> 00:35:01,759
Speaker 1: and then maybe like some sort of actual competition like someone sees a note on their screen or you know things like that get the people to do something and then like someone wins and gets to see stuff the other people didn't see and they try to take screenshots of it to prove it.

695
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:03,078
Speaker 1: and you know shit like that.

696
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:05,316
Speaker 0: Yeah I thought something weird happened.

697
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:10,220
Speaker 0: I was taking screenshots because I got separated from everyone but it was just a. I got teleported back to the beginning of the game.

698
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,716
Speaker 0: it wasn't anything special but for a second I was like guys oh my god I'm somewhere weird.

699
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:14,847
Speaker 0: let me get some screenshots.

700
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:17,619
Speaker 1: oh wait oh fuck yeah because you can just ride the elevator again.

701
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:23,915
Speaker 1: Um yeah also uh it's got some cool stuff in there like.

702
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:29,098
Speaker 1: there's a part where like you can there's a TV and you can put YouTube videos in the TV but it didn't really work.

703
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,160
Speaker 1: And there was also the part where like there was all these cats outside the elevator but you couldn't see them.

704
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,766
Speaker 1: only we could.

705
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:36,100
Speaker 0: I know like I think that was.

706
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,920
Speaker 0: I don't know what was wrong with my installation.

707
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,304
Speaker 1: You suck.

708
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:39,993
Speaker 0: I don't know.

709
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:41,380
Speaker 1: That's it.

710
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,586
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

711
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,666
Speaker 0: this is a fun experience I recommend.

712
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:51,280
Speaker 0: it's kind of like how uh you know not so much Four Swords but Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles the original.

713
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,090
Speaker 0: If you play it by yourself it's a pretty mediocre game.

714
00:35:55,655 --> 00:36:01,028
Speaker 0: But if you play it with four people who get into it it's one of the greatest gaming experiences you could ever have.

715
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:16,948
Speaker 0: And this is the same way in that if you play it with a bunch of people who all come into it ready to experience it with an open mind and some optimism it was enjoyable enough for us to actually talk about it here and say you should do it.

716
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:18,620
Speaker 0: Have we ever steered you wrong?

717
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:21,019
Speaker 0: Have we ever steered you wrong?

718
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,960
Speaker 1: Well yeah we didn't have anything else to do a show on either.

719
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:33,579
Speaker 1: I mean there's a bunch of Half-Life mods that are all sort of in the same category like the Stanley Parable and they're basically but this one made the rounds.

720
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:34,969
Speaker 1: So did that one.

721
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:43,398
Speaker 1: There's basically this whole genre of Half-Life mods which is I created a map with some scripted events and stuff like that and you go through it and it's.

722
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:53,779
Speaker 1: it's the kind of experience that you know you can't really make in a physical museum because it would just take up so much space and for one person to do it at a time wouldn't be economical you know.

723
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:55,957
Speaker 1: It's.

724
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,103
Speaker 1: you know it's like even better than amusement park rides.

725
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:00,487
Speaker 1: You can do things amusement park rides can't do because it's all fake.

726
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,455
Speaker 1: So it's it's pretty crazy.

727
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:08,100
Speaker 1: and you know if you like amusement park rides well you'll love the hell out of these things.

728
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,737
Speaker 1: right and there's a bunch of them so try them all out.

729
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,606
Speaker 0: They added support for custom floors.

730
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:17,050
Speaker 0: so I think we could use Gary's mod and some documentation to make our own floors.

731
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:19,759
Speaker 0: I wonder if we could just give it to them or make our own DLC.

732
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:23,960
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing with Gary's mod it's basically like like Stanley Parable is a mod mod.

733
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:25,878
Speaker 1: you can just you don't need Gary's mod for it.

734
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:30,647
Speaker 1: but you know this needs Gary's mod because basically Gary's mod is like the meta mod.

735
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:33,639
Speaker 1: it lets you make mods with it and it does other crazy stuff.

736
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:43,657
Speaker 1: so a lot of people who are can't really program a mod which is not easy can use Gary's mod to make a mod but then anyone who wants to play that mod needs Gary's mod.

737
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:45,439
Speaker 1: you know the whole thing anyway.

738
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:47,553
Speaker 0: This was super fun.

739
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:48,302
Speaker 0: you should do it.

740
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:51,390
Speaker 0: unless you don't have Gary's mod you don't plan to use it.

741
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:56,526
Speaker 0: You don't have friends and ten dollars is a lot of money but you should have friends on Steam.

742
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,496
Speaker 1: I mean come on guys.

743
00:37:57,537 --> 00:38:03,212
Speaker 0: You've got you've got to be able to get a posse like five people to hide inside the bones.

744
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:03,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

745
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,372
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
