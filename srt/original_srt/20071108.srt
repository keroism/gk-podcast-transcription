00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,855
Speaker 0: It's uh, it's cold today.

7
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:38,027
Speaker 1: You can always tell what season it is in the northern hemisphere.

8
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,866
Speaker 1: well in the geek house Yes by the by how we open the show.

9
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:46,243
Speaker 0: well People have pointed this out, and we kind of realized it long after.

10
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:52,403
Speaker 0: but ever since we saw NASA Cuffled with that one family guy there for whatever reason just stuck in our heads.

11
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:58,089
Speaker 0: mom today home yesterday Today woman space is one cold.

12
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, though, it's cold.

13
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:02,470
Speaker 1: I get it's pretty much.

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,769
Speaker 1: I mean like you know Eskimo not Eskimos.

15
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,241
Speaker 1: But anyway, they have like a hundred zillion words for snow because there are many different You know varieties of snow.

16
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:11,270
Speaker 1: the snow is sticking more.

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,718
Speaker 1: They have a different word if it's taking less.

18
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,628
Speaker 1: they have a different word if it's clumpy different word, right?

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:23,480
Speaker 1: But for us you pretty much boiled out weather entirely down to two things woman and Warm today warm yesterday.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,549
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the only two kinds of weather we can have.

21
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:32,769
Speaker 0: It was annoying though I get up you don't go to my car, and I see frost all over it.

22
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:34,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was quite frosty.

23
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,622
Speaker 1: I had to warm the car up a bit.

24
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,270
Speaker 1: I really I maybe I'll get a remote starter.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,751
Speaker 1: I don't know.

26
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,376
Speaker 0: those aren't the greatest.

27
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:44,130
Speaker 1: I know that's why I'm thinking about not getting one, but it's it's I don't know.

28
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:44,968
Speaker 0: I remembered our IT.

29
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:52,246
Speaker 0: I used to go out start my car Just leave it there unlocked and running next to the eight other cars that were doing the same thing.

30
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:56,388
Speaker 0: go back into my apartment Take a shower get dressed and then go to my car.

31
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,309
Speaker 1: It was a good plan because it totally melted off the whole car.

32
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,839
Speaker 1: I mean the car is like a fire in an engine.

33
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,850
Speaker 1: the thing is it's so cold it takes a while for that fire to Actually warm up this giant car made of metal.

34
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,476
Speaker 0: No That's way to impress little kids.

35
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:14,986
Speaker 0: when you drive it in a car just explain to them that the engine is a thousands upon thousands of controlled explosions every minute.

36
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:18,016
Speaker 0: yep That kind of fascinated me as a little kid.

37
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:21,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like how come the fire is not killing me over here.

38
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,684
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, let's just get to the chase.

39
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,250
Speaker 0: It's short week.

40
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,410
Speaker 0: We're trying to catch up on the fact that we've been going along for the past.

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,504
Speaker 1: I don't know seven months and also the Libsyn fill it up.

42
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:32,975
Speaker 0: We got a we're gonna upgrade it But until we do we gonna.

43
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,522
Speaker 1: probably we can't.

44
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:38,498
Speaker 1: we can't afford a graphic designer But we'll upgrade lives because Libsyn cost nothing.

45
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,324
Speaker 0: That's why there's no excuse not to use it.

46
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:46,190
Speaker 1: All right, so You know, we always talk about you know, the potential of you know.

47
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:50,510
Speaker 1: Oh you bought some DRM and then they fucked you over and now you paid for something and it's gone.

48
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,327
Speaker 0: And how a lot of our friends and people on the internet always say but they don't actually screw you.

49
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:59,650
Speaker 0: look no one ever Actually takes something away except for tribes too, but no one cares about that.

50
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:02,690
Speaker 1: Take away traps to with DRM but well they took it away.

51
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,350
Speaker 0: Well, it almost because you had to authenticate with their server to run their product.

52
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:11,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they just took their server away and never gave any way of unlocking said product.

53
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:14,442
Speaker 1: Well, they gave away keys until there weren't any keys left.

54
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:17,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can still download the game for free But there's no keys left.

55
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:21,030
Speaker 0: Yes, because yeah, hence the game is effectively unplayable.

56
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:24,844
Speaker 1: Anyway, they you know, people always talk about this with steam.

57
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:34,050
Speaker 1: like I don't want to buy a game on steam What if steam can screw me over and it's I guess it's technically possibly and they can maybe but you know the way steam works.

58
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:37,484
Speaker 1: I mean you can play stuff offline and shit kinda.

59
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,930
Speaker 0: there are problems with it.

60
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,470
Speaker 1: There are but like for example the quake games, right?

61
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:46,249
Speaker 1: It all it does is I can go into those folders and double click on quake daddy XE and it will work.

62
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:48,801
Speaker 0: That's just because those are old ass legacy game.

63
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:50,630
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that's you know, that's how it works.

64
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,959
Speaker 1: It doesn't, you know check online too often.

65
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,910
Speaker 0: I mean it's like how the old counter-strike was beholden to one.

66
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:57,043
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.

67
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:01,164
Speaker 1: Yep But anyway, you know, there's some DRM there and there's a potential.

68
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:02,950
Speaker 1: but valve is generally trustworthy.

69
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:12,008
Speaker 1: I think that if something happened that they would you know Just turn the steam off in such a way that everyone could play all the games they had that were single-player and they would just Turn off whatever they had to pay for.

70
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,938
Speaker 1: Regardless there is a potential for this in many situations.

71
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,904
Speaker 1: For example, the Apple iTunes action.

72
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:25,010
Speaker 1: they could just you know DRM everyone away But you don't actually see too many real-world examples of it actually happening.

73
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,452
Speaker 1: Someone actually turning off the DRM and everyone getting hosed Hence.

74
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:32,970
Speaker 0: a lot of people call us technologists who rent and rail against DRM as alarmists.

75
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:34,854
Speaker 1: Yes paranoid that won't happen.

76
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:36,899
Speaker 1: The company's on screw you over blah blah blah.

77
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,586
Speaker 1: Well major league baseball just did it.

78
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,933
Speaker 1: now if you don't know It's pretty hard.

79
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:53,193
Speaker 1: I mean one thing that TV still has going for is that if you like sports watching professional sports at least TV and radio are really the only places to get at that action You can like.

80
00:04:53,214 --> 00:05:05,430
Speaker 1: if you just want to listen to baseball games on the computer it costs money a lot of money a Ludicrous amount of money for this is because major league sports particularly Major League Baseball, but also the football.

81
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, hockey is one of the more liberal and even that he is very liberal.

82
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:13,474
Speaker 1: and even then actually f1 is probably the worst of All in the whole world.

83
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:20,725
Speaker 0: funny how despite the fact that oh, we need more people to watch f1 Let's make it as hard as possible for young hit people to watch our sport.

84
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:21,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's make it.

85
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:24,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know It's obviously something people are stuck wood.

86
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,650
Speaker 1: It would get popular if you've noticed how many videos that I get dug up on dig compared to say baseballs or hockey's or anything.

87
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,950
Speaker 1: But they make it so hard to watch so we can't actually take off.

88
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,464
Speaker 1: It's like all these people see it on dig and they might be interested but up can't actually.

89
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:49,170
Speaker 0: well all these industries are deathly afraid of the internet for various reasons and don't want anything to do with it unless they can charge a lot of money because They make us all their money from sponsorships.

90
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:50,877
Speaker 1: It's pretty much so.

91
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,107
Speaker 1: people just start distributing their videos on YouTube.

92
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:53,890
Speaker 1: They'll have no money.

93
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:58,745
Speaker 0: I mean it's to the point where they they make it impossible and they actually.

94
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:05,509
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of people talking more and more about how the Basically, they say that you don't have fair use rights to sports games.

95
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:08,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've been saying that for a long time and now there's rumblings.

96
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:12,698
Speaker 0: the legal world where people are saying You know that might not be true.

97
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:14,142
Speaker 1: It's almost definitely not true.

98
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:16,108
Speaker 1: You have fair use buried fair use.

99
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:16,850
Speaker 1: It's in a law.

100
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:22,286
Speaker 0: It's kind of an implied right though, it's not very oh it's pretty much says fair use.

101
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,410
Speaker 0: what does it say Scott?

102
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,734
Speaker 1: There's a list of things.

103
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:26,381
Speaker 0: the problem is those that list come from.

104
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,470
Speaker 0: is that list in the law or is that the opinion of?

105
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,927
Speaker 1: Someone know those things are in the law, huh?

106
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,225
Speaker 1: The thing is is that those things are not like straight and narrow.

107
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:36,466
Speaker 1: They're.

108
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:39,997
Speaker 1: they're pretty loosely Interpreted by courts, which is their weakness.

109
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:44,890
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is these people don't want anything to do with the internet.

110
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,290
Speaker 0: They stay away from as best they can and they go after anyone who so much as talks about a baseball game on the internet.

111
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:58,553
Speaker 1: Yep so if you want to watch baseball at least on the internet you can pay money and they will let you watch baseball on the internet.

112
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,870
Speaker 1: and What they just did is they turned off the DRM server.

113
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:08,382
Speaker 1: So people who paid a lot of money to watch baseball on the internet They just turned all their baseball off so that these people paid.

114
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:09,366
Speaker 1: they got videos.

115
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:10,170
Speaker 1: now the videos are gone.

116
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:16,590
Speaker 0: Now the argument that they made was that well you only paid for one viewing.

117
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:20,936
Speaker 0: Anyway, we were just graciously letting you watch more than one So you didn't lose anything.

118
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:25,939
Speaker 0: when we turned off all the access to every video you'd ever purchased Google did this actually before.

119
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:32,587
Speaker 1: when they had they were selling videos on Google video Before you know, they stopped doing that and they turned it all off and then they said alright everyone.

120
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,403
Speaker 0: Here's your money back You know, yeah, but Major League Baseball not quite so honorable.

121
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,747
Speaker 1: Nope what they have.

122
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:44,569
Speaker 1: it is though You know, here's a real example of someone turning off the DRM and fucking everyone over and going.

123
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:44,870
Speaker 1: aha.

124
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:57,870
Speaker 1: However, I think the the bad press on the issue They have been forced to do something about it and they they now said that you know I guess when stuff comes back up that if you bought something you'll get it back but not post season stuff.

125
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,027
Speaker 1: So if you like bought some playoff games, you won't get those back right away.

126
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:05,905
Speaker 1: Wow Maybe later you'll get them back when they figure out what to do with playoff stuff.

127
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:11,165
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but anyway, you know they did, you know bring something back.

128
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:14,293
Speaker 1: but the point is DRM you you.

129
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:26,358
Speaker 1: basically it's it's like if I go to Best Buy and buy a bunch of DVDs and I watch him or Maybe I don't watch some of them I watch a few of them and then the next day the Best Buy comes over and takes all the DVDs and My house and then there's nothing like.

130
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:35,690
Speaker 0: DRM is a tool like any other where you give up control Over things that you have paid for our own to someone else and you always have to think how much do I trust this person?

131
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,308
Speaker 0: it's kind of like this remote controlled gun of Damocles that's always pointed at whatever you just bought.

132
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:47,590
Speaker 0: and Who do you trust with remote control to the gun of Damocles pointed at whatever you just bought?

133
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

134
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,046
Speaker 0: do I trust valve kind of mostly trust Google pretty much Major League Baseball.

135
00:08:53,327 --> 00:09:01,437
Speaker 0: No now now Yeah right, so speaking of Nothing to do with DRM at all.

136
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:07,249
Speaker 0: This is kind of related to our actual show more so than anything else, but Unslash out there's article here.

137
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:19,474
Speaker 0: It looks like the FTC is starting to actually crack down on all those people who are just blatantly ignoring the do not call list in the United States, ah Good times.

138
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,390
Speaker 0: the problem with this is that of course they can't crack down on the worst offenders.

139
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:26,781
Speaker 0: I the people who are not covered by the do not call list.

140
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:32,131
Speaker 0: I'm speaking specifically about politicians and Quote-unquote Surveys.

141
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:33,579
Speaker 1: now remember charities.

142
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,610
Speaker 0: right charities are just as bad God.

143
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:41,630
Speaker 1: There are certain people who are allowed to call the people on the do not call list and it really it just shouldn't be anybody.

144
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,284
Speaker 1: No one should be allowed to go see.

145
00:09:43,325 --> 00:10:00,670
Speaker 0: on one hand I understand the argument for the politicians because the argument is if you're a politician You should always have the right to contact in any way that you can your constituents and political speech and freedom of speech And all that and I I'm kind of I at least understand that argument.

146
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:10,109
Speaker 0: but then they allow polling in surveys and a lot of these polls and surveys basically come down to How great is our product?

147
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:14,350
Speaker 0: How much money would you pay to buy this awesome product?

148
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,430
Speaker 0: Let me tell you more about the product so you can make a better answer to the question of would you buy our product?

149
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,235
Speaker 0: You like to buy our product.

150
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

151
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:29,593
Speaker 0: I Just feel like this problem shouldn't exist.

152
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:37,334
Speaker 0: and it only exists because the way phones work even with all the fancy technology and cell phones is Still pretty archaic.

153
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:47,230
Speaker 0: and while we have similar spam problems on the internet with things like email and I am It's pretty trivial to filter that out, but I can't filter out phone calls easily.

154
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,984
Speaker 1: Well, you have caller ID but caller ID is trivially spoofed.

155
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:51,406
Speaker 1: Yep.

156
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:52,530
Speaker 1: I mean think about it.

157
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:59,931
Speaker 1: I went to that Transformers website right and I typed in rims phone number and I typed in my phone number and then I typed I chose a funny Message.

158
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:11,324
Speaker 1: so some computer somewhere called the rim on the phone rim looked at his caller ID thought it was me Even though I didn't call him right and then had a conversation with Optimus Prime.

159
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,467
Speaker 1: that covers it lots of crime.

160
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:20,350
Speaker 1: So Faking caller ID is basically perfect and easy and it's it's not useful as a real filter of calls.

161
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,559
Speaker 0: Also, there aren't many systems that will automate.

162
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:27,310
Speaker 0: I can't set up an access list for my phone with the caller ID.

163
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:33,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be pretty cool as if like you could have your phone set up So only people on your contacts list could call you.

164
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,189
Speaker 0: you can pay for services.

165
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do things to that effect.

166
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:40,909
Speaker 1: The thing is, you know, how it would only it could only work on the caller ID.

167
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,090
Speaker 1: Well, how would it work?

168
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:55,330
Speaker 0: If someone did actually a lot of these services you can pay and all all incoming calls except on a white list get routed to Basically a secretary who answers figures out if they're a telemarketer or not and then only forwards you real calls.

169
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:59,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I was like what if someone caught my mom calls me collect for the middle of nowhere.

170
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:03,500
Speaker 0: I'd be like, uh-oh You know calling someone collect is not gonna help.

171
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,470
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find a computer somewhere and email him.

172
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,056
Speaker 0: It's it's the modern world people.

173
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:08,723
Speaker 1: I know but you get.

174
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:13,009
Speaker 0: the point is it I'll use my cell phone And you might say what if you don't have your cell phone?

175
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:16,310
Speaker 1: Your cell phone ran out of battery and it's an emergency.

176
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,141
Speaker 0: I'll borrow any of the thousand cell phones nearby.

177
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:22,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then the caller ID won't be right and you'll be filtered.

178
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,872
Speaker 1: You know what?

179
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:23,254
Speaker 1: I'm saying?

180
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:24,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't care.

181
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just really don't care.

182
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:43,636
Speaker 0: what matters to me more than anything is people not being able to call me and bother me and charge me money because I pay for my cell phone minutes and There's no argument anyone can make that will convince me that a comprehensive do not call list should be anything other than outright Immediate law.

183
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:59,748
Speaker 1: I think we should have some sort of thing where if someone calls you and they're a company of some sort you can ask for like certain information and then if you You know You just report that information to some place and then you get money and then they if they ever call you again You get more money.

184
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:13,170
Speaker 0: The other trouble is the old problem with pre-existing business relationships where if a company can make up some sort of fanciful Notion that you have somehow ever Contacted them in any way then they can use that as a loophole to call.

185
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,577
Speaker 1: The worst offender is the cable company Like I had.

186
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:16,386
Speaker 1: I pay for the.

187
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:24,329
Speaker 1: you know The optimum online cable internet service is in my name and they call me like every month like hey Do you want to get phone and TV too?

188
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,390
Speaker 1: Do you want to get phone and TV when you get phone and TV?

189
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,416
Speaker 1: We're gonna get phone and TV.

190
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,310
Speaker 1: You have a special deal special deal special deal.

191
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,777
Speaker 1: I'm like, you know have a special deal.

192
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,510
Speaker 1: the triple play is this deal that you have all the time?

193
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,473
Speaker 1: It's non-stop.

194
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,356
Speaker 1: I could get it any time.

195
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:35,898
Speaker 1: I wanted.

196
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,062
Speaker 1: it's not a new deal.

197
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:38,206
Speaker 1: Stop calling me.

198
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,054
Speaker 1: Stop calling me I don't.

199
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:40,938
Speaker 1: I only want internet.

200
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,430
Speaker 1: Are you gonna make my internet cheaper without making me get anything else?

201
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,974
Speaker 1: I don't want.

202
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:44,620
Speaker 1: no then.

203
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,064
Speaker 1: I don't care.

204
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:45,609
Speaker 1: go away.

205
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:52,759
Speaker 0: I remember when they used to send people out every now and then to just look at us and see if we were stealing cable Because they didn't believe that we don't actually watch TV.

206
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:53,682
Speaker 1: Well, they've stopped doing that.

207
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:54,847
Speaker 1: So maybe we should start stealing cable.

208
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:58,035
Speaker 0: Yeah To what end?

209
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:58,778
Speaker 0: what would that?

210
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:06,306
Speaker 0: I I guess we could watch South Park, but even then we'd have to get a Smith TV set up because I'm not gonna watch an ad.

211
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:14,324
Speaker 0: Yep Things of the day.

212
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:28,680
Speaker 0: so we take CG, you know computer graphics and computer animation kind of for granted now, but There was a time a time in 1983 When computer graphics were shall we say in a primitive state?

213
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,034
Speaker 1: I remember that episode of the Muppet Babies that had some CG in it like.

214
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:32,978
Speaker 1: I'll check this out.

215
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:39,940
Speaker 0: Oh, man You know I just remember the Muppet Babies and I would give a lot to be able to buy a DVD box out of that entire thing.

216
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:42,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, people forget that the Muppet Babies was like.

217
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:48,599
Speaker 1: basically I could probably I could probably make a good case that YouTube would not be What it was that Muppet Babies?

218
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:52,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll get we'll do a show or something about that about the Muppet Babies.

219
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:53,397
Speaker 0: I think we could.

220
00:14:53,417 --> 00:15:13,240
Speaker 0: okay I think we could easily anyway, so this I found this on YouTube kind of randomly, but it is a Disney's I guess one of their first forays into digital animation and 3d animation ever and Specifically they had the rights to where the wild things are.

221
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,435
Speaker 1: I don't think they have those rights anymore, but I'm feeling back then they did and they couldn't like.

222
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:42,260
Speaker 0: they never did anything with it Except they use the characters just because that was what they wanted to use and they made a little animation And then they tried to integrate it with this 3d computer animated world mm-hmm, and this is that original primitive clip and It's very interesting to watch because the hand-drawn animation is great And the rest of it looks like a video game from the multimedia era.

223
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:54,877
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty It's kind of interesting and they there's a bit of stuff before they show it where they talk about Why Disney animation was so great and why it was better than anyone else's animation.

224
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:55,640
Speaker 1: They had more money.

225
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:59,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, no, no specifically squash and stretch.

226
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:04,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he brings it out He's like, yes, our characters squash and stretch, right?

227
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:05,774
Speaker 0: That's they were great.

228
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:07,520
Speaker 0: Well Emily taught me what that was.

229
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,189
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that this is sort of like.

230
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:15,146
Speaker 1: also like this is like the seed that grew into the Pixar I have a feeling well.

231
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,491
Speaker 0: the real thing I got to say though.

232
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:21,130
Speaker 0: Is that I I really want to see Where the wild things are by Disney.

233
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,496
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that'd be cool.

234
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:27,277
Speaker 1: That'd be really cool I like especially if you watch the animation from this I'd like and where the wild things are.

235
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:28,060
Speaker 1: It's high quality.

236
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,472
Speaker 0: So watch this before Disney finds out it's on the internet and probably removes it.

237
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,616
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, cuz that'll happen.

238
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:33,157
Speaker 1: So, okay.

239
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:39,939
Speaker 1: All right Speaking of wild things this has nothing to do with wild things has to do with Lord of the Rings.

240
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:42,038
Speaker 0: you I can't steal my joke.

241
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:47,856
Speaker 0: It's my stick to say speaking of blah and then say something unrelated.

242
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:54,937
Speaker 0: Well, I've rhymed Barely Wings things rings that that was weak.

243
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,814
Speaker 1: anyway You know origami, you know, you make a little paper crane make a little spider.

244
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,800
Speaker 1: You've seen some good origami something internet.

245
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:03,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen a few.

246
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:08,076
Speaker 1: This is the best origami I've ever seen on the internet.

247
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:08,880
Speaker 0: This is so good.

248
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:15,339
Speaker 0: I would feel that it was fake except I just have this impression that no that guy's just that dedicated to paper folding.

249
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,507
Speaker 1: This is for real.

250
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,794
Speaker 1: Hey check this out.

251
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:18,740
Speaker 1: You got a Gandalf.

252
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,826
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what looks like.

253
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:23,983
Speaker 1: it looks like a Gandalf a Gimli and a Legolas Made out of each.

254
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:26,893
Speaker 1: each one made out of a single square piece of paper.

255
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:28,156
Speaker 0: Keep that in your mind.

256
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:36,435
Speaker 1: a single Folded sheet of square paper Probably a really big piece of paper, but it just one piece of paper.

257
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:37,640
Speaker 0: and look at these things.

258
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:41,975
Speaker 0: I mean, they're almost as impressive as Lord of the Rings on the go.

259
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,312
Speaker 0: I Just had to bring that up.

260
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:48,651
Speaker 1: Yeah Check this stuff out and maybe I don't know.

261
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:51,880
Speaker 1: maybe seeing this will encourage you to become an origami master.

262
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,189
Speaker 0: You know, I'm awful at origami.

263
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,695
Speaker 1: I am also awful at origami.

264
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:56,940
Speaker 1: I can't even make the stupid crane.

265
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:58,645
Speaker 0: I tried a lot.

266
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:04,000
Speaker 0: In fact in fourth grade we had we were all making paper cranes for there was something.

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,740
Speaker 0: I don't even remember what the deal was, but we were sending them to Japan.

268
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,310
Speaker 0: I think it was actually on the anniversary of Hiroshima or something.

269
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,234
Speaker 0: Like there's some big tall.

270
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:15,594
Speaker 0: the Catholic schools were doing it But I failed at making even a single one.

271
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:17,160
Speaker 1: I can barely make a paper airplane.

272
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,170
Speaker 0: They the T the nuns actually rejected the few attempts I'd made and didn't send them.

273
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,777
Speaker 0: No because they were that bad Wow.

274
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:26,345
Speaker 0: I Felt bad as a kid about that.

275
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:29,698
Speaker 1: actually, uh, yeah, I just kind of accepted it.

276
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,960
Speaker 0: Hey, at least they were better than my handwriting.

277
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:36,319
Speaker 1: My handwriting is yeah, right?

278
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:53,480
Speaker 0: So we're not gonna talk about this at too much length, but this previous Tuesday was in America election day but a lot of people in America seem to think that elections only happen once every four years and Pretty much we have an election every year for various things.

279
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:03,960
Speaker 0: But this is what we call like the super off-term election and nothing Important or big was really up in most places except for you know, mayor of the town.

280
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:17,852
Speaker 1: Oh, but remember as far as most Americans are concerned voting for president is the only election they even know about Either one that matters least whereas, you know, I'd say Congress people Person is probably the most important person you vote for.

281
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:23,880
Speaker 0: most people only vote for Congressmen because they happen to be in the polls on a presidential election.

282
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:28,052
Speaker 1: Yep, in fact state congressperson is probably the most important person you vote for.

283
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,560
Speaker 1: that matters in your life the most more than anyone else.

284
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:31,758
Speaker 1: Yep, at least in the US.

285
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:36,120
Speaker 0: But uh, we had one of those elections and of course hardly anyone voted.

286
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,380
Speaker 0: But the election in Beacon where we live was actually a little bit contested.

287
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:53,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the the existing mayor was going out So it was no incumbents running for mayor and there were a lot of other You know important positions like County executive that were up for grabs.

288
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:01,016
Speaker 1: So, you know some guy who from what I can tell from his ads was not the greatest guy was going up against the long-term incumbent, you know.

289
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:06,155
Speaker 1: and Yeah, there were a lot of seats pretty much on the county and local level all up for grabs.

290
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:26,960
Speaker 0: now Scott and I because you Know, well, I'm more politically minded than Scott I'd say but even he agreed that we can't really shit talk about all the government block if we don't get active locally and we Don't you know pay attention to what's going on locally make informed decisions, you know Actually be at least vote and care why we're voting and not just only vote for presidents and Congress people.

291
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:35,570
Speaker 0: Yeah so we endeavored to find out as much as we could about all the candidates and all the positions locally and in the county and the city and everything.

292
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,731
Speaker 1: and Actually, there was one thing I could have done that I didn't do and that was the actual.

293
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:45,095
Speaker 1: the local newspaper had videos and interviews with all the candidates and I was gonna watch him and then I didn't.

294
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:47,572
Speaker 0: I Tried to watch them.

295
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:50,311
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm There's a word for it.

296
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,780
Speaker 0: I believe the word is boring.

297
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,611
Speaker 0: I believe the words the sentence would be.

298
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:55,775
Speaker 0: they didn't say anything.

299
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,020
Speaker 0: that wasn't in their ads.

300
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,594
Speaker 0: I watched one and I didn't bother.

301
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:06,364
Speaker 0: Yeah but we endeavored to find out everything we could and vote as informed citizens and That's where the trouble began.

302
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:12,264
Speaker 0: It seems that the only way we could find out about their positions was from the edge They sent us.

303
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:19,813
Speaker 0: So alright once we accepted that fact fine We'll vote solely based on what these people have said they're going to do.

304
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:21,337
Speaker 0: We will trust what they are saying.

305
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:22,079
Speaker 0: They're going to do.

306
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:27,811
Speaker 1: well What they said they're gonna do is nothing nothing.

307
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:28,754
Speaker 1: They didn't say anything.

308
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:31,182
Speaker 1: you pick up the ads and it's like, okay I pick up one ad.

309
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:40,549
Speaker 0: they'd always say things like I am an advocate of an open government an active government a Government that's transparent and that'll do what the people want.

310
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,893
Speaker 0: We need change.

311
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:44,140
Speaker 0: We need things to be better than they were before.

312
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

313
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:48,057
Speaker 1: I pick up it one ad for County Executive and the other ad for County Executive.

314
00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:49,044
Speaker 1: the two different guys right.

315
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,648
Speaker 1: one guy says I'm gonna keep taxes low.

316
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:55,240
Speaker 1: The other guy says I'm gonna lower taxes.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,465
Speaker 0: Great.

318
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:57,738
Speaker 0: What's my choice?

319
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,385
Speaker 0: What choice do I have?

320
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:00,672
Speaker 1: What if I want to raise taxes?

321
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:02,260
Speaker 1: I have no one to vote for and that's the problem.

322
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:03,806
Speaker 0: I do want to raise taxes.

323
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,939
Speaker 1: I've decided mostly because I don't pay them directly.

324
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,008
Speaker 0: Well, it's not just that.

325
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:15,328
Speaker 0: I mean this area actually Alright little bit of history in New York State.

326
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:24,639
Speaker 0: there is often the kind of conflict between New York City Which is the majority of the population of the entire state and the entire rest of the state.

327
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,101
Speaker 1: Yep,

328
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:33,122
Speaker 0: in terms of the fact that generally New York City kind of funds development everywhere else in New York State and like At

329
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:36,940
Speaker 1: the same time everywhere else in the state provides food and water for the city

330
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,599
Speaker 0: Even though New York could probably just buy it off from China if they wanted

331
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,443
Speaker 1: Probably.

332
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,672
Speaker 1: but then we'd get much shittier food and shittier water.

333
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:44,820
Speaker 1: But the thing is New York City has the best tap water.

334
00:22:45,303 --> 00:22:48,420
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not saying oh, New York City shouldn't subsidize these things.

335
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,088
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that New York City kind of does.

336
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:56,316
Speaker 0: and the economy of New York City and the taxes New York Tend to be distributed is why New York works is because you have one city one big city.

337
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:59,900
Speaker 1: You have some other cities, but not so many and they're not really that big.

338
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,980
Speaker 1: Well considering like I think Yonkers is the second biggest city and you've got a whole lot of just open land.

339
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:07,666
Speaker 1: That's not really city.

340
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,151
Speaker 1: that's more rural.

341
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,380
Speaker 1: that basically powers all the city.

342
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:21,906
Speaker 0: I mean, we've got big cities at the other end of the state, but they're so far away that I'm not gonna Yeah, and Buffalo really not much of a city compared to I don't know Manhattan Compared to the Bronx.

343
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:23,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's just cuz.

344
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,776
Speaker 0: New York City is a gigantic monster.

345
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:25,680
Speaker 0: That's beside the point.

346
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:47,100
Speaker 0: the politics of New York State Tend to oscillate between two states two Conditions either They're taking money from the city and throwing it furiously into improvement projects in the state Or they're trying to cut those programs as fast as they can because they think they need to send that money back to New York City.

347
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:48,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

348
00:23:49,321 --> 00:24:01,060
Speaker 0: But lately a lot that there's been this idea that a lot of the money has been going into very specific Targeted I guess local improve improvement programs mostly along the Hudson River, which is where we live.

349
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:03,219
Speaker 1: Well, it's those ones we notice cuz that's where we live.

350
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:03,560
Speaker 1: well

351
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:18,556
Speaker 0: actually the Hudson Valley improvement projects have been taking a great deal of money and part of that is because there's a lot of state money put aside anyway for you know rivers and estuaries and drinking water and tourism and also there's a lot of federal money for that sort of thing.

352
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:23,080
Speaker 0: and Beacon and all these cities along the river.

353
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:34,128
Speaker 0: well at least the ones that are doing it right have actually been using this money and Improving like markedly and the economy in upstate New York and by upstate I mean the Mid Hudson Valley.

354
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:40,739
Speaker 0: in the Hudson Valley has been going gangbusters Lately not relative to what it was relative to what it was ten years ago.

355
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:44,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's not like oh man's everything here is awesome.

356
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,860
Speaker 1: But then again, it was a shithole a while ago and now it's not.

357
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:59,040
Speaker 0: So the thing is it seems that in this area the the increase of civil services and basic You know city services has been very pointedly improving the economy.

358
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:13,190
Speaker 0: It has indeed and I am of the mind that we should spend more money to improve Local infrastructure while we currently have the money and the liberty to do so and while I live here and it like commuter infrastructure Everything I want Metro north to get more money.

359
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,340
Speaker 0: I want there to be more buses and local transit.

360
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:18,930
Speaker 1: I want everything that makes my life better to happen.

361
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:20,134
Speaker 1: Yes, I agree.

362
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:20,716
Speaker 0: There's the thing.

363
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:22,180
Speaker 0: It's not just I want these things.

364
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:23,891
Speaker 0: I'm willing to pay for them.

365
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:25,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I already pay for them.

366
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:25,821
Speaker 1: I'm

367
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:38,544
Speaker 0: willing to pay more to get more because they have proven that in this in this one instance in this one little area in This one little state in America More taxes is turned into better services that were worth the money We spent

368
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:40,039
Speaker 1: kind of for the most part.

369
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:45,696
Speaker 0: But the problem is every single candidate for every position except the judges who didn't campaign for jack all.

370
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:50,100
Speaker 0: I felt bad about that Because I actually wanted to vote for them, but it's like voting for the judge might matter.

371
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,039
Speaker 1: But the judges didn't campaign so I didn't know which judges stood for what at all.

372
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:58,231
Speaker 0: But there was no candidate that advocated anything like that.

373
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:01,700
Speaker 0: They either advocated lowering taxes or not raising taxes.

374
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:03,891
Speaker 1: Wow, there's a big difference.

375
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:17,816
Speaker 0: and on every other issue They were silent like literally there was nothing to differentiate candidates other than one was a really old man And one was a slightly less old man with slightly worse policies.

376
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:22,039
Speaker 0: and by worse policies I mean he wanted to lower taxes instead of not raising them.

377
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was really no way.

378
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:34,171
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like that, you know in a much smaller town I could maybe know these people You know and be able or if I was you know Not a commuter and I was actually able to participate in the town.

379
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:41,100
Speaker 1: cuz this thing the biggest problem with town politics The only people who can participate are people stay home all day or people who work in town.

380
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:57,435
Speaker 1: You know like most of the guys running like one of the guys Owned an insurance company on Main Street Another guy owned a real estate company on the other side of town is the people who work in town live in town stay in Town all day can do town things, you know people who commute but happen to live here.

381
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:58,920
Speaker 1: It's pretty much impossible.

382
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:05,245
Speaker 1: Sure, they keep the polls open and I can vote which is good I guess you know sort of necessary But I don't really.

383
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:11,792
Speaker 1: I can't really do much in the town because I'm not here most of the day even though I live here So I can't really get involved.

384
00:27:11,852 --> 00:27:16,879
Speaker 1: I can't run for anything I can't really know these people or get to know them and it generally sucks.

385
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,752
Speaker 1: I mean these people came to our houses like one time.

386
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:26,440
Speaker 1: I came and I went to the front door and there was a piece Of paper that said, you know, I was here basically and one of the people running for mayor had stopped at the door.

387
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:28,064
Speaker 1: But but I didn't.

388
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:40,700
Speaker 0: I was like one o'clock on a weekday clearly doesn't want to talk to the commuters clearly wanted to talk to Homemakers nothing more because no one is gonna be home at one o'clock in a commuter town except homemakers.

389
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,820
Speaker 1: In fact, it was crazy that it actually happened on one day.

390
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:46,020
Speaker 1: I happened to be home from work, but I was in the shower.

391
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:51,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, he came by while I was home from work when I took that week off before my new job and I was a different guy.

392
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,007
Speaker 0: I think I didn't even hear anyone knock.

393
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:57,680
Speaker 1: I think that guy was running for like, you know County like counsel?

394
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:58,283
Speaker 0: I don't know.

395
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,133
Speaker 0: I think the problem was I wanted later.

396
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:08,040
Speaker 0: I wanted to vote I wanted to be active in local politics and then upon investigating no candidate stood for anything.

397
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:09,024
Speaker 1: No, they were all.

398
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:10,690
Speaker 1: just I want to make the town better.

399
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:11,835
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make vote for me.

400
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:12,457
Speaker 1: vote for me.

401
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:17,988
Speaker 0: on one hand I have taken very little issue like the only Complaint I saw like Quimby on The Simpsons.

402
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:23,668
Speaker 0: the only complaint I had about our local government and what goes on Had nothing to do with the elected people.

403
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,840
Speaker 0: It was a referendum and I just think the people in the city voted stupidly.

404
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:31,100
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean there was a referendum some sort of you know question to vote on this time.

405
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,223
Speaker 1: But I went in the booth and it was like something something Lake something reservoir something something I'm like.

406
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:41,996
Speaker 1: I read it and I understood what it was saying But I had no idea the places it was talking about.

407
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:47,680
Speaker 1: it was like Do you want to start getting water from this lake and stop getting water from that lake and remove state funding for this?

408
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,899
Speaker 1: But get state funding for that and give this to the state.

409
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:51,469
Speaker 1: But then the state will give this to us.

410
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:54,549
Speaker 1: and I was like, I don't know enough about it I'm just not gonna vote on that.

411
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one publicized it So we didn't even know it was gonna be on the ballot.

412
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:58,980
Speaker 0: So I didn't have time to do research.

413
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:02,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I guess I could find out about this stuff from the local newspaper.

414
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:11,031
Speaker 0: the last two referendums We had one was should we raise taxes and then make Metro north and you know New York City transit super big in the state.

415
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:22,259
Speaker 1: and everyone said no no god No, even though I said, yes, I'm probably the only we're about the only two people who said yes Maybe I mean I could find about this local paper But I had to pay money to find out what's going on in my town.

416
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:32,743
Speaker 0: And the other one was let's spend millions of taxpayer money To buy land that people are trying to put houses on and not let them put houses on it because we don't want too many People to move to our city.

417
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:34,529
Speaker 1: I want more things here.

418
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,596
Speaker 1: more things is better things.

419
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:37,438
Speaker 1: I like things.

420
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:37,960
Speaker 1: I like people.

421
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,024
Speaker 1: I want more people here.

422
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,048
Speaker 0: You don't like people.

423
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:41,052
Speaker 0: you hate people.

424
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:41,574
Speaker 0: you come.

425
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:43,100
Speaker 0: you do nothing would complain about people.

426
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:44,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want more of them.

427
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,392
Speaker 0: That must be your DNA.

428
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,343
Speaker 0: Apollo's song Maybe.

429
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:56,124
Speaker 1: but you know a town with more people means more demand for services Which means more services.

430
00:29:56,605 --> 00:30:02,886
Speaker 0: and also more people means a greater variety of services and then competition over that market Which means better services.

431
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,408
Speaker 0: Yep.

432
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,019
Speaker 0: I mean the biggest problem in beak.

433
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,272
Speaker 0: I mean Here's the real problem.

434
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:09,140
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not a problem.

435
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:10,706
Speaker 1: No grocery store.

436
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,420
Speaker 0: I was gonna say that but beacons doing great.

437
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,879
Speaker 0: The thing is regardless of the fact that these people like there was no reason for me to vote for one person over the other Beacons been generally getting better.

438
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:29,280
Speaker 0: So I'm not angry to the point if I should run for an office or actually Do something risky to try to change things or be super loud about anything.

439
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:35,932
Speaker 0: But at the same time there are things that could be better that just don't get better Because no one cares with me and if

440
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:41,760
Speaker 1: I want to do something about it I'm screwed because I'm a commuter who spends four hours a week podcasting though

441
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:50,200
Speaker 0: Actually, Scott and I are really thinking about as soon as we get time maybe over the holidays We'll set this up of forming a local political action committee.

442
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:55,120
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll see designed specifically for commuters and will advertise at the train station.

443
00:30:55,221 --> 00:31:03,400
Speaker 0: And then basically all we want to do is get a list of I guess Grievances and desires from all the commuters in the city and then present that to the city government.

444
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,171
Speaker 0: You know like like here are the top three priorities for commuters.

445
00:31:06,472 --> 00:31:08,280
Speaker 0: There are this many of us will vote in a block.

446
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:15,612
Speaker 1: All right I think I kind of want to end this now because I can get a good food neat and we got to keep it Sure, but in general I think the thing is ideally.

447
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:31,525
Speaker 1: we local politics are cool and having you know A federated government is awesome and we want to be involved and we want to be active in in controlling the destiny of our town and The the quality of our lives and the place that we live, but it's incredibly just kind of crappy And it's not really.

448
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:34,699
Speaker 0: I'll end on this because this is the important thing other than a little tidbit.

449
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,800
Speaker 0: A lot of people have told me this over the years, but now I've seen it firsthand.

450
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,222
Speaker 0: generally locally in the US Republicans and Democrats are Reversed.

451
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:44,885
Speaker 1: are they really?

452
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:52,020
Speaker 0: it's like if you want the stuff that Democrats want nationally That's the same thing that Republicans want locally and vice-versa.

453
00:31:52,100 --> 00:32:02,420
Speaker 1: Well, it kind of makes sense because Republicans are all about you know - theoretically on paper It's they're more states rights, you know more local power less federal power and Democrats are more federal power less local power.

454
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:15,633
Speaker 1: So if you really want just a more powerful government across the board if you vote for Republicans in your state and your town And you vote for Democrats in the federal place Then you're just gonna get a more powerful government in every possible location.

455
00:32:15,754 --> 00:32:17,480
Speaker 0: on paper think of that what you will.

456
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,889
Speaker 1: Yeah on paper though.

457
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:25,098
Speaker 1: That's not the way it really turns out Yeah, but that's the way it is in the social studies textbook, which it does not match.

458
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:25,480
Speaker 1: reality

459
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:41,651
Speaker 0: But - I decided after getting a phone call from a fucking Autodialer that how I was gonna vote because it didn't matter anymore at any rate was just I was gonna keep track of any candidate that called me with an Autodialer on my cell phone and just not vote for them.

460
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:55,073
Speaker 0: and by the time the election came Every single candidate for every single office except the judges had called me with an autodialer and left some stupid message Yep, mostly telling me about how bad the other candidate was.

461
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went into the voting booth.

462
00:32:56,861 --> 00:33:00,840
Speaker 1: I clicked like one box for one guy that I remembered and then I pulled the lever.

463
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:02,839
Speaker 1: I voted one vote for one guy and that was it.

464
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:04,937
Speaker 0: I went and I was gonna do a protest vote.

465
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:07,832
Speaker 0: either I was gonna write in myself or I was gonna vote for no one.

466
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:09,500
Speaker 1: just pulled the lever and pulled lever again.

467
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:16,460
Speaker 0: But the reason I didn't was by the time I got there There was like a half-hour line to vote and I wasn't gonna stand there for a half-hour to do nothing.

468
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,646
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't gonna do that.

469
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:18,269
Speaker 0: So I went home.

470
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I there wasn't a line when I went.

471
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,111
Speaker 1: I just went pulled lever click pulled lever.

472
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:23,339
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's it.

473
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:26,899
Speaker 1: I actually spent a minute in there reading the stupid referendum that I didn't vote on.
