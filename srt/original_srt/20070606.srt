1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,727
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday June 6th.

2
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:11,811
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,440
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is the geek nights.

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:21,059
Speaker 0: Tonight we reviewed the amazing awesome comic just released a trade paperback Elks run.

5
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:40,130
Speaker 1: You know if it weren't for the fact that the one thing I need from Linux isn't on Windows I think I would have given up on Linux pretty much right now at least for my primary computer because Audio just doesn't work for shit in Linux.

6
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,510
Speaker 1: I gotta say I gotta say I got to admit well I mean, it's not that audio doesn't work in Linux.

7
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,517
Speaker 0: It audio is shitty in Linux.

8
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:48,300
Speaker 0: There is no doubt.

9
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:54,280
Speaker 0: It's just that Linux works pretty much perfectly well for absolutely normal everyday computer.

10
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:56,247
Speaker 1: Apparently it's not normal to record.

11
00:00:56,267 --> 00:01:03,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it works perfectly normal on Nor you know run-of-the-mill Older hardware.

12
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:06,400
Speaker 0: when you have a new fancy computer, it's not gonna work for shit.

13
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,645
Speaker 1: It's not that new.

14
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,011
Speaker 0: I'm not a great deal of effort.

15
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,577
Speaker 1: It's not really that new and fancy.

16
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,609
Speaker 1: this chip sets Relatively old and see but it's.

17
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:16,340
Speaker 0: it's relatively new and fancy compared to Linux.

18
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,538
Speaker 0: I'm talking like you know two-year-old stuff here.

19
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,520
Speaker 0: well I think that's some 64 bits or two cores.

20
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:32,819
Speaker 1: Or I think the problem is more that most people use Linux don't do anything like podcasting So no one really cares about if the audio actually works for anything intense.

21
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:33,241
Speaker 1: well See that's.

22
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,393
Speaker 0: the thing is that there are a lot of podcasters on Linux.

23
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:37,859
Speaker 1: Oh, there's like three.

24
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,695
Speaker 0: There's actually a whole like at least 20 or 30 I can name like five.

25
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:45,958
Speaker 0: I think all right But it's you know it.

26
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:56,880
Speaker 0: It's mostly the fact that if you want Linux to be easy you pretty much Ubuntu feisty is the way to go And that's also the best way to get the newest hardware working with the least effort.

27
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:05,900
Speaker 0: But also because the way Ubuntu works You're not gonna be able to upgrade the kernel like there's a better kernel that might work really well on your computer.

28
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:08,519
Speaker 0: But you can't get that in feisty great really easily.

29
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,019
Speaker 0: You know gentoo you could but that's a huge pain in the ass.

30
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:16,275
Speaker 0: So it all comes down to like your distributions and all this stuff.

31
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:26,839
Speaker 0: and right now There does not exist a Linux distribution that without a great deal of effort It doesn't have problems doing exactly what we want to do.

32
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:33,864
Speaker 0: Yeah It's always the special cases that it totally fucks on and all the general cases Linux has it covered.

33
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:43,235
Speaker 0: when it comes down to a special case like I want to do this specific thing that is slightly out of Line of the norm you're gonna run into at least one bump in the road.

34
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,560
Speaker 0: It's guaranteed.

35
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I want to play games on my computer.

36
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:47,655
Speaker 1: Oh Linux.

37
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:48,520
Speaker 1: Can't do that?

38
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,520
Speaker 0: No again, it's because the games haven't been written for Linux.

39
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,724
Speaker 0: Just fine.

40
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:56,528
Speaker 1: Oh great.

41
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,220
Speaker 1: Yeah doom 3 was such a wonderful game.

42
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,830
Speaker 0: At least the audio is actually a complaint like there's something wrong with Linux.

43
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:07,043
Speaker 0: the games complaint is not really anything wrong with Linux It's in fact.

44
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,772
Speaker 0: I say it's a miracle that you can wine so many games.

45
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's more games.

46
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,424
Speaker 0: You can't wine That is true.

47
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:13,866
Speaker 0: Honestly.

48
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,635
Speaker 1: I would just boot into Windows, but ReSound doesn't work.

49
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,725
Speaker 1: ReSound barely works in Linux So it certainly doesn't work in Windows.

50
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:20,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just.

52
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:31,060
Speaker 0: I think more of our problem Also is that there just don't exist that many quality single-track wave editing programs.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,628
Speaker 0: They just aren't any of them that they did.

54
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:34,391
Speaker 0: where are they?

55
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:41,674
Speaker 0: this ReSound which has a bunch of problems there was cool It was cool at it, and I guess audition, and that's what else is there?

56
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:42,757
Speaker 0: is that Sony thing?

57
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:43,279
Speaker 0: fuck that?

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:52,142
Speaker 0: What there's a whole frickin type of application and there are so few choices and no one's working on this Problem.

59
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,810
Speaker 1: because no one cares except me and I have time.

60
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:55,894
Speaker 0: I know like imagine.

61
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,900
Speaker 0: It was like only one spreadsheet.

62
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:02,819
Speaker 1: You know what there effectively is because most people don't know about open office And they don't care.

63
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:05,660
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is like there are a whole bunch of spreadsheets, and they all work.

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,431
Speaker 0: And if you need one you can get one.

65
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:08,860
Speaker 0: yeah, and it's not a problem.

66
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,488
Speaker 0: We need a specific application.

67
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:14,399
Speaker 1: It doesn't exist because not many people do what we do.

68
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,173
Speaker 0: I think it's a lot of people do would do that.

69
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:18,259
Speaker 0: It's just they don't know any better.

70
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,774
Speaker 1: well I mean they'd like I said they don't do what we do.

71
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:21,680
Speaker 1: they do things differently.

72
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,502
Speaker 1: They do things.

73
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:25,331
Speaker 1: they use that garage band or all those other programs.

74
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:32,088
Speaker 1: the way the multi-track editors work like audacity is a pretty Good multi-track editor But it's actually really crap.

75
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:35,397
Speaker 1: if you want to edit or actually filter audio all the filters are garbage.

76
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:36,500
Speaker 1: the compressor is garbage.

77
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,267
Speaker 1: Lots of support barely works.

78
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:43,065
Speaker 1: most of the lots of plugins are crap, but that's it's Wednesday So we're going to talk about this anymore.

79
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:47,459
Speaker 1: I'm just miffed that my new computer is awesome except for podcasting.

80
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:49,831
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

81
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:50,595
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

82
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,279
Speaker 0: What's she gonna do?

83
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,460
Speaker 0: So I got some news, but the site that has the news article currently has an internal server error.

84
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,299
Speaker 0: But that doesn't matter because I remember the news enough.

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:12,383
Speaker 0: Basically, it's bad news really bad news Like possibly some of the worst news if you've ever seen I don't know Macross.

86
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:17,816
Speaker 0: you know the original one the amazing amazing TV show that is the amazing of all amazingness.

87
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,160
Speaker 0: or if you've seen I don't know a whole bunch of other anime.

88
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:26,400
Speaker 0: I can't really remember the names of it all because I probably haven't watched any of them.

89
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,110
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter you watch.

90
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,580
Speaker 0: Macross has this amazing soundtrack.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,417
Speaker 0: It's like fully composed with an orchestra and the whole deal, and it's.

92
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,760
Speaker 0: it's really Sort of weird, but it fits so well, and it's so wonderful in every way.

93
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:50,020
Speaker 0: And it was composed by a man named Kentaro Haneda and Kentaro Haneda I regret has recently passed away.

94
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:58,013
Speaker 1: Now if I had it available, which I don't just because I haven't migrated all of my data yet I would probably have played the Macross national anthem just now.

95
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:03,875
Speaker 0: I've got every Macross mp3 There is on my computer over there, so if we want we can go get it.

96
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,009
Speaker 1: no now with all the problems I'm having with audio right now in Linux.

97
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,492
Speaker 1: Yeah,

98
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:24,008
Speaker 0: yeah, but regardless This is kind of sad because he was this amazing composer, and if you've never watched Macross you should at least like Watch some episodes and just listen to the music in that show even if you don't like the show because it's not a show for Everyone even though it's a show for everyone.

99
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,172
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you not liking it.

100
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:26,457
Speaker 1: I'll admit.

101
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:28,906
Speaker 1: I it's okay I don't I don't like it that much.

102
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,075
Speaker 1: you suck, and I've watched almost all of it.

103
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:35,271
Speaker 0: you suck, but The music in it is really something to behold.

104
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,480
Speaker 0: and they're gonna have a big concert.

105
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,035
Speaker 0: They were planning this already having a big concert for you know the I guess 25th anniversary of Macross.

106
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:49,280
Speaker 0: I think I'm not sure but When they had they're gonna of course now dedicate that concert to this guy.

107
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:53,220
Speaker 0: So I'm definitely gonna like be looking for a DVD of that or so let's go to the concert.

108
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:54,667
Speaker 0: I think it's a little far away.

109
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:55,330
Speaker 1: Where is it?

110
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,636
Speaker 0: Japan on the side of the world?

111
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:57,299
Speaker 1: Let's head over there.

112
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:58,866
Speaker 1: That's all you know biggie.

113
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

114
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:04,130
Speaker 1: so in news more close to home Con season is upon us.

115
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,620
Speaker 1: This is more of a personal news.

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,469
Speaker 1: It's not a news that's out there on the internet anywhere.

117
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,535
Speaker 1: It's just my observation.

118
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:09,480
Speaker 0: We're making news.

119
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:10,285
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

120
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:10,868
Speaker 0: Is that the wow?

121
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,840
Speaker 0: is that the next step for you guys to make news?

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
Speaker 0: We're gonna be journalists read news from a website.

123
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:19,254
Speaker 1: Well, it's kind of annoying news, and I haven't really.

124
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:30,207
Speaker 1: I have one or two Last-ditch leads I could use to figure out what's going on But I got to say that I'm getting the impression that Otacon is really not That together.

125
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,865
Speaker 1: this year compared to any other year of Otacon It's really.

126
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:36,980
Speaker 0: it's more upsetting because I'm looking at what other cons are doing.

127
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:40,376
Speaker 0: Look at the go to anime Expos website and look at the news.

128
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:42,906
Speaker 0: remember we talked about anime So was last week or two weeks ago.

129
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:43,207
Speaker 0: Yep.

130
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,840
Speaker 0: They're doing some crazy amazing shit over there.

131
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,224
Speaker 0: Like I usually like.

132
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:49,669
Speaker 0: I never been to anime expo.

133
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:57,580
Speaker 0: so but I had suspicions about it for a long time that it was a very Industry centric con and I got the feeling that it wasn't my kind of deal.

134
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:05,731
Speaker 0: But based on the news and the press releases they have put out this year It's looking really hot just in terms of what they're having there.

135
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,596
Speaker 0: You know regardless of anything else.

136
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:23,153
Speaker 0: I may be suspicious about Meanwhile Otacon is what a month or two away, and they haven't announced a musical guest or anything and They just recently had like the panels and the artist alley submissions.

137
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,840
Speaker 0: They haven't gotten back to anybody about it.

138
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,380
Speaker 1: I don't know if they've gotten back to anyone or not for the artist alley But they definitely did not respond in any way to my request for a table at all.

139
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:39,746
Speaker 0: I mean usually cons get all this stuff out of the way Way before the con.

140
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:43,720
Speaker 0: like you'll get your artist alley table like six months in advance.

141
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:45,506
Speaker 0: You'll get your pet.

142
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,480
Speaker 0: You'll know know it if you're doing a panel or not way in advance.

143
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:56,340
Speaker 0: I mean, how are people who are like preparing fancy panels supposed to know like prepare the panel in such a short period of time?

144
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:59,300
Speaker 1: I'll put it in very specific because it's not just my perception.

145
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,031
Speaker 1: I'll tell you exactly about my interactions with all the conventions.

146
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:09,952
Speaker 1: We've been working with this year and for next year all right and basically Long time ago, and I started talking to Kinetic con.

147
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,539
Speaker 1: We've already hammered the whole thing out.

148
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,080
Speaker 1: Kinetic con is already set and we're done.

149
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,449
Speaker 1: We've already got all of our programming ready.

150
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:20,949
Speaker 1: all that's left to do is to specifically schedule When they'll all be.

151
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,198
Speaker 1: but I already have a vague idea.

152
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:25,430
Speaker 0: yep So Kinetic con is like a couple weeks before Otacon.

153
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,260
Speaker 0: you got this hammered out when oh god over a month ago.

154
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,084
Speaker 0: It's over a month ago.

155
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:39,479
Speaker 1: in fact they responded to me within 12 hours Every single time I've emailed them and in fact they out of the blue send me status updates on what's going on.

156
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,490
Speaker 0: All right, and didn't we just hear something from katsu-kun?

157
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,179
Speaker 1: Oh all right, so katsu-kun next year?

158
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:46,423
Speaker 1: Well one.

159
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:53,544
Speaker 1: we're subscribed to the state like the video game katsu staff email list because we're kind of staff for them And it was really fun.

160
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,150
Speaker 0: We're half members of game katsu.

161
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,297
Speaker 1: Yeah, and those guys are all awesome.

162
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Basically unlike.

163
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:12,588
Speaker 1: I don't know how other conventions work, but I do know that watching that mailing list They started planning next katsu-kun pretty much two weeks after katsu-kun ended And they've been continuously talking about it.

164
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:13,792
Speaker 1: and now well.

165
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:16,400
Speaker 1: They're already putting together the programming for katsu-kun.

166
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:23,377
Speaker 1: We're already working with them to get the programming done for katsu-kun Which is months and months and months away a long time from now.

167
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:23,860
Speaker 0: meanwhile?

168
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,377
Speaker 0: Otakon Perhaps our favorite card.

169
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:27,660
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

170
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,180
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna name any names because I don't know how many of you work with these people, but I've emailed Otakon.

171
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,456
Speaker 1: I've sent dozens of emails to Otakon and various people in the past several years.

172
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:38,696
Speaker 1: Maybe

173
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:39,920
Speaker 0: that's oh in the several years

174
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:40,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's why

175
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,953
Speaker 0: they're not replying because you're emailing them to death,

176
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:54,416
Speaker 1: but this year I Anyone I've ever emailed within Otakon has not responded to me at all or if they did They responded with basically nothing or they said in fact at one point.

177
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,946
Speaker 1: I got an email saying oh well We'll get back with you shortly.

178
00:10:56,966 --> 00:11:00,079
Speaker 1: We're almost done with whatever and then they just never follow up.

179
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:08,545
Speaker 0: It's like okay your con is the biggest and the baddest on the East Coast But if you don't get on the ball I think it's already on its way.

180
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,470
Speaker 0: it feels like it's.

181
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,513
Speaker 0: it's on the way down.

182
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:16,620
Speaker 0: now like I honestly all the other cons have bigger Badder events and they're on the ball and Otakon.

183
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,809
Speaker 1: I mean I hate to say it, but we're getting to the point where if they don't respond soon Even if they want us to do panels.

184
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,556
Speaker 1: We're not gonna prepare anything.

185
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:24,360
Speaker 1: We're not we can't.

186
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,997
Speaker 1: We've got too much else to do with other cons.

187
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:39,170
Speaker 0: now I know it's it's it's I might like and if they drop the ball too hard this year I could see in the future like it could be the doom of Otakon in a few years or Could be at least with me what might not even go.

188
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:45,640
Speaker 1: yeah meanwhile the New York anime festival Which a lot of people have maligned a little bit about being very corporate yeah

189
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:53,929
Speaker 0: Very skeptical about the New York anime festival to say because it was run by the same people's New York comic-con And it's gonna be for-profit It's gonna be the Javits Center.

190
00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:03,780
Speaker 0: and those three things when added to Anime convention send off all the alarm bells and the brain of Scott saying warning warning major catastrophe coming to you soon.

191
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,700
Speaker 1: Well, we can't talk about it yet.

192
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,979
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if we can but I don't want to reveal anything.

193
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,200
Speaker 0: well Let me go see what they have said on their website.

194
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,386
Speaker 1: Yes suffice to say they.

195
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:20,959
Speaker 1: it seems like they've got their act together Really well and a lot better than anyone would have expected and I actually have high hopes for this convention now.

196
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,989
Speaker 1: plus When I talk talk to them about panels.

197
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,076
Speaker 1: we already the contracts done.

198
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:30,290
Speaker 1: We're doing panels there It's already all set up and this thing is until December.

199
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,774
Speaker 0: it December people.

200
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,480
Speaker 0: We actually have time to prepare things.

201
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:36,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it's it's I don't want.

202
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:36,648
Speaker 1: I don't know.

203
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:44,687
Speaker 0: cuz see I don't have access to the internal Otakon communications because it's a much more I guess closed Information can compared to other cons.

204
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:48,500
Speaker 0: so I could just be you know, making up stuff or it could be totally wrong.

205
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,006
Speaker 0: But my first this is my perception.

206
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:53,300
Speaker 0: I'm soft talking here and I don't speak for the truth of anything.

207
00:12:53,420 --> 00:13:02,897
Speaker 0: But from going on Otakon message boards and proposing many suggestions for the con over the years Many times suggestions that were I think quite good suggestions.

208
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:10,620
Speaker 0: not all the time But sometimes we're always shot down as saying that will require too much F, you know physical manual labor.

209
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,060
Speaker 0: We don't have the people or the time or the manpower and I accepted that answer, you know as okay.

210
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:21,660
Speaker 0: You can't possibly do this unless you have a whole bunch of money to hire people to do it because it takes forever and whatever.

211
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:40,939
Speaker 0: But I really I get the feeling personally that the people who run Otakon at least some of them Someone who's doing something is not working as hard or as many hours for the con Outside of the actual hours of the con compared to other conventions, that's the feeling that I get.

212
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,180
Speaker 0: granted.

213
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,780
Speaker 1: I mean one don't forget Otakon is still our favorite con.

214
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:46,973
Speaker 0: It might not be but right now it still is.

215
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,072
Speaker 1: as of cons I've been to and two I mean, it's like all these cons.

216
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:51,020
Speaker 1: That's all volunteer work.

217
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,750
Speaker 1: So while you can't fault someone for not putting in.

218
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,963
Speaker 1: I don't know that like the super effort that we would put into something like That.

219
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:07,207
Speaker 1: yeah at the same time I have offered every year for the past three years to just handle panels for Otakon and join the staff and No one is.

220
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,870
Speaker 1: at once someone said yeah We'll get back with you and they never got back with me.

221
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:20,813
Speaker 1: and then in person at the con someone said yeah We'll email you and they never emailed me and I just gave up and I got to say of all the cons I've we've ever done panels with even in previous years.

222
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:23,502
Speaker 1: Otakon really doesn't Respond.

223
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:30,858
Speaker 1: well these panels that Otakon has never responded to emails in a timely manner and It's really hard to work with them to get a panel going.

224
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,849
Speaker 0: These people they need to remember if you're.

225
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,494
Speaker 0: I mean if I emailed.

226
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:45,754
Speaker 0: I don't know if I picked a random convention Akon, I guess that's I know that's a convention called Akon right if I emailed them today I would imagine that they would email me back tomorrow or within the week.

227
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:50,520
Speaker 1: at least that would be like and that would be actually Kind of bad in the very least if it was to a specific department.

228
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,679
Speaker 1: I mean if you just send an email to the con chair of Otakon.

229
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,620
Speaker 1: I don't expect the conjure of Otakon to respond to me.

230
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,125
Speaker 0: Like if I had a specific thing like, you know asking for some information or something that wasn't on their website I'm pretty sure they'd get back to me.

231
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,480
Speaker 0: Otakon just doesn't get back to people and that's a big problem.

232
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:10,180
Speaker 1: And uh, I just want that not to again not to name any names.

233
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:20,999
Speaker 1: But there's a couple other people who are staff or should be staff for Otakon who have expressed to me Independently that they have had a lot of hard time getting answers out of anyone else in the Otakon staff.

234
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:27,307
Speaker 1: and Even like the big panels that we do every year No one knows what's going on with them.

235
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:31,260
Speaker 1: and I'm at the point where I'm assuming that I'm not doing anything at Otakon this year.

236
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:36,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess all I can say left is we need to work on our communication.

237
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

238
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:41,859
Speaker 1: it just bothers me because Otakon is my favorite con and Yeah, I want it.

239
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,270
Speaker 1: I guess I feel like I I mean I'm not.

240
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:55,140
Speaker 1: I want to put my money where my mouth is because we kind of We panned Kineticon a little bit last year and Kineticon immediately got back with us and said all right hotshots.

241
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,769
Speaker 1: Well, uh, if that's how you feel then are you gonna help out?

242
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,833
Speaker 1: and we said damn straight.

243
00:15:59,255 --> 00:15:59,456
Speaker 0: Yep.

244
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:00,600
Speaker 0: That's exactly right.

245
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:18,552
Speaker 0: And so now I you know Kineticon respect plus plus, you know You might my experience going to your convention as a guest last year might not have you know I meant everything I said and whatever podcast we reviewed it, but now you come up and you're like, all right You know, we're actually cool people, you know, we didn't.

246
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:19,456
Speaker 0: we can't do everything.

247
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:23,573
Speaker 0: Not everyone's perfect Not every conventions gonna be perfect and it's not gonna be perfect for everyone.

248
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:27,940
Speaker 0: But you know you you're talking shit All right, come on and so respect for them.

249
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,899
Speaker 0: But Otakon, you know, they put on this great convention that I enjoy a lot every year.

250
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:41,360
Speaker 1: But trying to interact with them not making me happy I mean, I just think I'll end it on this and I don't think this is negatistical thing to say.

251
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:57,060
Speaker 1: But I think that despite doing geek nights and my job and all the other things in my life I could probably handle the panels part of Otakon and respond to every email I got within 24 hours And I probably have all the panels set and done at least five months before the convention.

252
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,840
Speaker 1: In fact, I would require them to be well at least all the fan panels because I know it's hard.

253
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,340
Speaker 1: You got to coordinate with the industry people.

254
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,501
Speaker 1: Yeah,

255
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:17,180
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have the schedule of what time and what rooms but I would know You know exactly how many hours worth of panel programming I needed and I would have the people and their and what panels they were doing lined up well in advance

256
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,260
Speaker 1: and

257
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,406
Speaker 0: I would not allow that to change.

258
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,380
Speaker 0: unless you know, someone quit on me and I'd have backups too.

259
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:27,540
Speaker 0: I'd have like okay prepare your panel, but I can't guarantee it'll go on just in case someone else quits.

260
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,283
Speaker 1: yeah, well, I have a lot.

261
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:35,019
Speaker 1: I know exactly how we would run panels for Otakon or any convention and If Otakon would let us we do it.

262
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,500
Speaker 1: But until then we'll see what happens at Otakon because I don't know what we're doing.

263
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,383
Speaker 0: It's not be hilarious.

264
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,086
Speaker 0: He went to Otakon.

265
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:42,069
Speaker 0: There is no panels.

266
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would be just I don't know.

267
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:45,742
Speaker 1: You know what?

268
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:49,839
Speaker 1: I hate to say this and this is really mean to say but it'd be a lot like the previous Otakon.

269
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,426
Speaker 1: I mean not.

270
00:17:52,566 --> 00:18:05,122
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that every panel at well every fan panel at Otakon last year was bad But everyone I attended was really really terrible like below what I would expect from even a mediocre Panel.

271
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:08,700
Speaker 1: at a con like this Otakon is too big to accept the bad panel.

272
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,753
Speaker 0: There might have been good ones that we you know, didn't attend.

273
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,038
Speaker 0: I guess that's possible.

274
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:13,580
Speaker 1: There were a few.

275
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,820
Speaker 1: I forget the names offhand, but our listeners did tell us about the one or two panels that were good.

276
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,141
Speaker 1: Yes,

277
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:35,500
Speaker 0: but if your convention is so big as Otakon the biggest anime convention on the East Coast you should have so many panel applications from so many people that you should be able to sift the wheat from the chaff and There's not that much hour, there's not that many hours of panels to actually fill in.

278
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:42,020
Speaker 0: It should be trivial to fill them in with the highest quality panel so that any panel room at any time is awesome.

279
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:44,440
Speaker 0: It just might not, you know fit someone's taste.

280
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:52,293
Speaker 0: I mean, I might not want to go to a super doll fee super doll fee panel But yeah, but you can have the best damn super doll fee panel in the country right there.

281
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:52,955
Speaker 0: Yeah team.

282
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:56,491
Speaker 0: So yeah, whatever Email us Otakon.

283
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:57,619
Speaker 1: What the hell's your problem?

284
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:00,526
Speaker 0: Email new invention.

285
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:00,928
Speaker 0: use it.

286
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'm I don't want to get one.

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,206
Speaker 0: You click the reply button you get one.

288
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:06,771
Speaker 0: you click the reply button every time.

289
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,855
Speaker 1: in the very least.

290
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:13,420
Speaker 0: what I what you do is If you can't respond to the email like if I ask you like hey who's gonna be the musical guest, right?

291
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,324
Speaker 0: You don't just.

292
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,279
Speaker 0: you don't tell me because you can't tell me yet.

293
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:16,923
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

294
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:17,547
Speaker 1: if you ask.

295
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:19,839
Speaker 1: if I was the con chair, I would ignore an email like that.

296
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:26,529
Speaker 0: I know I know but like if it was like a well-written professional email right not just like hey some punk kid going Who's the musical guest?

297
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,460
Speaker 0: OMG, right?

298
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,712
Speaker 0: But if a professional email comes in you don't just ignore it Even if it's asking for something you don't know or you can't tell you.

299
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,479
Speaker 0: say I regret to inform you blah blah blah.

300
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,306
Speaker 0: at this Time I cannot reveal that information.

301
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:38,828
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

302
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,475
Speaker 0: that way at least we know.

303
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:41,760
Speaker 0: fucking someone read it.

304
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,273
Speaker 1: That's all we want to know is that someone's reading it.

305
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:51,260
Speaker 0: Someone's paying attention Someone's is doing something, you know, I want to feel like my email didn't just go into the void.

306
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,950
Speaker 0: How do I know a spam filter didn't eat it?

307
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:54,519
Speaker 0: That's all we need.

308
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:58,414
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess I put up with this for the last many years because I never really.

309
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:07,593
Speaker 1: I didn't work with many other conventions Until now and now that I've worked with a lot of other conventions I'm starting to see that every other convention is really easy to work with.

310
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just like hey, how you doing?

311
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,743
Speaker 1: You want to thank God?

312
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,873
Speaker 1: Toricon scheduled a panel for us without even asking us.

313
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:15,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the easiest to work with ever.

314
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

315
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:17,427
Speaker 0: All right.

316
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:18,271
Speaker 1: I think we're done with that.

317
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:21,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, no malice was meant of course But it is.

318
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,011
Speaker 0: it bridges state.

319
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:37,609
Speaker 1: our personal experience, yeah deep nights full of truthiness great But that aside it's time for things of the day.

320
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:52,230
Speaker 1: total cop-out, but the fact that it was on dig is kind of lucky because this is one moment in The Simpsons that for some reason is Oftquoted and very often just brought up in casual conversation in the front row crew.

321
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:56,830
Speaker 1: This exact scene just happened to be on dig today, so it's got to be my thing of the day.

322
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:01,229
Speaker 1: I don't know if I even want to explain what it is other than must crush.

323
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

324
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:12,438
Speaker 0: basically whenever Communism comes up in our group someone inevitably says must crush Capitalism or possibly.

325
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:13,062
Speaker 1: Yes.

326
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:17,890
Speaker 0: That's what we wanted you to think Yep, and here is where that came from.

327
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,870
Speaker 0: So now you are part of the inside joke as well and you can lift ten inside jokes.

328
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,725
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day rim doesn't know about this at least.

329
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:26,930
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he doesn't know about this.

330
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:29,909
Speaker 0: I don't know you didn't but I think you'll be very interested in it.

331
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:34,390
Speaker 0: It is a recipe and it is a. it's not an Asian recipe.

332
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:43,910
Speaker 0: So the only way I could but I can relate it to anime day very loosely Because it is involving a rice cooker.

333
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,230
Speaker 0: Aha Here is a recipe on how to make something in a rice cooker.

334
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:50,533
Speaker 0: You know what?

335
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:50,916
Speaker 0: He's gonna.

336
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,410
Speaker 0: you know what this recipe tells you how to make it.

337
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:53,692
Speaker 1: Let's see.

338
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:54,255
Speaker 0: I'll give you a hint.

339
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:54,938
Speaker 0: It's not rice.

340
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,087
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm gonna take make a few guesses.

341
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:02,666
Speaker 1: Uh sponge cake nope, um Stew nope, chili.

342
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:06,196
Speaker 0: No, uh Flan nope jello.

Speaker 0: Nope.

Speaker 1: All right.

345
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,501
Speaker 1: I'm out.

346
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,750
Speaker 0: bread just bread bread.

347
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,986
Speaker 0: You say here's a way to make bread in a rice cooker.

348
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,090
Speaker 0: You don't have a bread maker.

349
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,839
Speaker 0: You're afraid to use the oven.

350
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:18,750
Speaker 0: you want to use a nice safe rice cooker.

351
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,839
Speaker 0: Follow these easy steps at this, you know, it's.

352
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:22,762
Speaker 0: it's actually a recipe.

353
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:25,570
Speaker 0: wiki place wiki how the how-to manual.

354
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:26,155
Speaker 0: You know what?

355
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,730
Speaker 1: We've got two rice cookers.

356
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,165
Speaker 1: We should take the old rice cooker and try to make bread in it because it certainly doesn't make.

357
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:37,940
Speaker 0: this guy made like this nice sort of Circular loaf of bread in his rice cooker.

358
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,570
Speaker 1: Was it the size and shape of the inside of a rice cooker?

359
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,835
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not.

360
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,810
Speaker 0: it doesn't go up to the full height of the rice cooker.

361
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:44,514
Speaker 0: Ah, like.

362
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,570
Speaker 0: it's only like a couple inches high and it's circular like here.

363
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,190
Speaker 0: Look, it looks sort of like a like a cheese disc, huh?

364
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,455
Speaker 1: Only you cut out a wedge of it and eat it whenever we have a free weekend Which will be August at this point.

365
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,618
Speaker 1: I might try that.

366
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:01,910
Speaker 0: Yeah flour yeast sugar salt butter milk water rice cooker.

367
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:05,769
Speaker 0: So this is pretty cool for anyone out there with rice cooker.

368
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:18,224
Speaker 1: So we've done a lot of anime and everything lately and every now every time it's like every day that goes by where we don't Talk about comics the comic fans you listen to us Email us bit by bit asking us when we're gonna talk about comics again.

369
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,489
Speaker 1: So I think today's that day.

370
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:25,430
Speaker 0: Actually this comic we're gonna talk about is kind of funny it because I get lots of comics.

371
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,343
Speaker 0: I mean today how many comics came in the mail?

372
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:32,470
Speaker 1: Oh my god I came home and there was a box that was somewhat difficult to lift in the front porch.

373
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,830
Speaker 0: Yeah Basically, I pre-order comics two months in advance to get a huge discount.

374
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:40,810
Speaker 0: Like I get 75% off some things and I get mostly trades.

375
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:47,095
Speaker 0: It's like I'll get like a $20 comic like trade paperback for like $12.

376
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:49,403
Speaker 0: so pre-ordering two months in advance is totally worth it.

377
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:49,764
Speaker 0: Yes.

378
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:57,790
Speaker 0: I'm planning to sell everything I'm never going to read again mostly to shave save shelf space and save money again because I do end up pre-ordering.

379
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,615
Speaker 0: I don't get to see what I'm buying before I buy it and sometimes I buy a bad comic most of the times I don't.

380
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:04,649
Speaker 0: yeah, sometimes I do.

381
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:09,872
Speaker 1: I mostly use it through Scott to get all of a given manga series that I really like Manga.

382
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:11,639
Speaker 0: I pre-order manga two months in advance.

383
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:13,807
Speaker 0: $10 manga for me is like seven dollars.

384
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:14,690
Speaker 0: Yeah and change.

385
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,425
Speaker 1: So I got chromartie so I plan to get Emma.

386
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:23,309
Speaker 0: Yep So it's one comic I ordered because I had a whole bunch of hype and I read it and it was pretty good.

387
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:28,955
Speaker 0: So I usually if I think a comic is pretty good and not underwear pervert Which means rim will read it.

388
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:32,657
Speaker 0: then I'll like give it to him say hey read this sometime We'll do it on the show.

389
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:39,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically Scott comes into my room You know while we're doing the show and then afterward He'll usually just plop a comic book on my desk or something or just leave it in my room.

390
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,310
Speaker 0: and Usually rim doesn't read it or he takes forever and he doesn't read the whole thing.

391
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,201
Speaker 1: It used to be that way because I didn't train to commute.

392
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:49,670
Speaker 1: So I really had no time to read manga.

393
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:53,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now that I take the train I grab a manga or a comic pretty much every day.

394
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:58,547
Speaker 0: So this was kind of amazing because I gave it to rim and like a day later.

395
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,490
Speaker 0: He had read the whole thing.

396
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,716
Speaker 1: I was kind of surprised too.

397
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:04,498
Speaker 1: I mean usually I pick him up flip him through him and then say alright I'll get to this.

398
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:09,350
Speaker 1: I'll put it at the end of the queue Which means it's never getting read.

399
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:22,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, my cue basically my cue not just my Netflix cue But my life cue has a few things in the front and a few things at the back and I just keep adding things to The middle but I never get to the middle because the middle keeps growing.

400
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:29,610
Speaker 1: Yep, but no I for some reason read it partly because it was one shot I knew that it would end and there wouldn't be more volumes of it.

401
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,790
Speaker 1: So if I liked it, I wouldn't be sucked into this trap of having to read it all like I was with Ex Machina.

402
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:36,163
Speaker 0: Yeah, Ex Machina is gonna end though.

403
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:37,048
Speaker 0: I think after like 50 issues.

404
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,864
Speaker 0: So there's only like a few more trades before it's over.

405
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:40,367
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

406
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:40,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

407
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,950
Speaker 1: But even so this I knew there's no commitment.

408
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,510
Speaker 1: I could pick it up put it down and also I'll admit the art was kind of bad.

409
00:25:47,951 --> 00:26:00,730
Speaker 1: So I didn't have my usual problem where I tend to read some comics and some manga But not all manga at all comics Really slowly and generally the better the art is the slower I read it because I spent a lot of time admiring the art.

410
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:25,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, generally what I do is like I will admire art also in reading comics But like I don't admire the art in every panel like I'll admire just like the amazing panels like if I read Akira like there's certain panels like I know where they are because I've read the whole thing like seven times and Every time I get to them, I'll stop and look at them for like a minute But then as soon as I finish admiring it I'm like burning through the panels and pages and pages pages pages pages.

411
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:30,283
Speaker 0: But I will go back and admire the art when I'm not reading it like.

412
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:32,590
Speaker 0: I'll admire the art separately like I'll just open the book.

413
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:34,830
Speaker 1: Oh, I do that with sanctuary all the time.

414
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,910
Speaker 1: I'll just walk over there open a random sanctuary and flip to one of those two page spreads.

415
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:40,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, or death note.

416
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:41,590
Speaker 0: I do that sometimes.

417
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:49,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually like a lot of the like I have some DC books where actually I don't like them But this is really nice arts in them, and I'll just look at him.

418
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,317
Speaker 0: But yeah this book the art.

419
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,525
Speaker 0: You know it's not bad art.

420
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:54,705
Speaker 1: Well.

421
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:55,588
Speaker 1: It doesn't detract.

422
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,578
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong It doesn't detract at all from the story.

423
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:01,297
Speaker 0: It didn't say what the book is yet, and we're already oh We're doing a Dave and Joel here.

424
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,090
Speaker 1: I know did we talk about it yet, or did we say what it was?

425
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:04,731
Speaker 0: I think we did.

426
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:05,835
Speaker 0: I think it's time to do it now.

427
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,176
Speaker 0: alright.

428
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,804

00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,563
Speaker 0: Which is actually.

443
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,907
Speaker 0: I looked up Villard books.

00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:52,436
Speaker 0: It's Villard books is basically Random House.

445
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:53,459
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

446
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,886
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's just a thing.

447
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,955
Speaker 0: They're putting on like a lot of like.

448
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:06,975
Speaker 0: they're actually buying up a lot of cool hip graphic novels like this and Publishing them which is pretty awesome Right.

449
00:28:07,378 --> 00:28:18,640
Speaker 1: so it's a story Basically about an insular community that is created by what Vietnam War veterans I think they're war veterans of some sort.

450
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:19,463
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

451
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:20,025
Speaker 1: Basically.

452
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:21,430
Speaker 1: It's the Michigan militia.

453
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,573
Speaker 1: It's that idea.

454
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:28,630
Speaker 1: the people who the super survivalists the people who say this country is corrupt or going down the tubes are dangerous or whatever.

455
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,509
Speaker 1: We're true patriots.

456
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:32,074
Speaker 1: so we're going

457
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:32,816
Speaker 0: to live in

458
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:54,117
Speaker 1: the mountains in our own closed community entirely self-reliant with the real Constitution and When the commies eventually come we'll be the ones to hold out or you know That sort of thing the not really a cult so much as just a very very Introverted Introspective closed-off community.

459
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:57,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, I choice and not by any other reason.

460
00:28:57,629 --> 00:29:08,936
Speaker 0: Yep So you have this this group of people maybe some hundred people or so Maybe a few hundred it's hard to tell and they decide to set up a town in Elks Ridge in the middle of fuck nowhere Where no one was an elks run?

461
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,895
Speaker 0: No, I think I think it's Elks Ridge the town of Elks Ridge In West Virginia.

462
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:15,745
Speaker 0: All right, elks run is the name of the book.

463
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:22,790
Speaker 0: Ah yes, and It's basically impossible to get in or out of the town except through this tunnel.

464
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:33,519
Speaker 0: So and the town sort of takes care of itself Except as a guy who drives into the town with a truck full of supplies every week or so Yep, and even does that under the table in cash.

465
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,430
Speaker 1: So there's no record in the government anywhere that this town exists.

466
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:42,470
Speaker 0: Yep, and these people live in seclusion very happily on their own with their crazy ways.

467
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:47,310
Speaker 0: They're not really that crazy in their ways You know at least as far as you can tell at the beginning of the book.

468
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, it definitely starts in this really kind of idyllic.

469
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is kind of working.

470
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:56,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, it's mostly the story starts to focus on the kids who live in this town.

471
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,673
Speaker 1: See now think of this.

472
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:00,283
Speaker 1: these people decide that they want this community.

473
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:01,950
Speaker 1: All right, they bring their wives.

474
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:06,607
Speaker 1: All right, the wives are now in on it, but no one's allowed to leave like that's.

475
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:09,419
Speaker 1: one of the big rules They have is like no one come no one goes out.

476
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:10,162
Speaker 1: No one comes in.

477
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,950
Speaker 1: It's completely cut off.

478
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,590
Speaker 1: They don't want any contact with the outside world because it'll corrupt the kids or whatever.

479
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,445
Speaker 1: But even so it's still a choice.

480
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:25,840
Speaker 1: now you've got kids being born here who realize that there's an outside world and Realize that something weird is kind of like.

481
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,690
Speaker 1: this is kind of a weird place to be living.

482
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,365
Speaker 1: But yet what are they gonna do about it?

483
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:29,809
Speaker 1: their kids?

484
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:38,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly, you know You've got the way they make it really frustrating is that like the main characters is teenage boy And there's no girls in town like this.

485
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:45,207
Speaker 0: one girl in town Maybe and she's like way older than he is like to wear it out in.

486
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:46,010
Speaker 0: like normal world.

487
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,044
Speaker 0: They wouldn't even like consider each other but because they're the only she's the only girl.

488
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:57,110
Speaker 0: it's sort of like a and that That that talk about frustrating, you know being forced to live in a closed community.

489
00:30:57,532 --> 00:30:58,777
Speaker 0: There are no girls here.

490
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,323
Speaker 0: that there just aren't any.

491
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:01,488
Speaker 0: it's not that you can't get one.

492
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:06,187
Speaker 0: You're some nerd It's there aren't any and you can't leave to go find some and none will come in.

493
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:10,390
Speaker 1: now I don't want to ruin any because it's a one-shot, you know one story.

494
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,630
Speaker 1: I don't want to ruin any of the story in this.

495
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:12,811
Speaker 1: I

496
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:31,421
Speaker 0: think it was originally eight comic book issues and this trade paperback for 1995 manufacturers to just retail price is all eight of those issues in a row with a little bit of fun stuff at the beginning like a little introduction page and a little Is there a prologue page in the back?

497
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:32,709
Speaker 0: There's an afterword in the back.

498
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:37,262
Speaker 1: Basically the story without revealing much is that I mean?

499
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:39,950
Speaker 1: the community is kind of weird and there is tension.

500
00:31:39,990 --> 00:32:06,547
Speaker 1: I mean despite the fact that it seems very ideal and very happy there is tension among many of the people in this community, but it's all kind of below the surface and a small thing happens and the small thing sets into motion a chain of events that Basically inexorably drives the town toward getting into this out-of-control Situation where everything starts to break down and all the things that were under the surface start exploding out.

501
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,939
Speaker 1: and it's just an escalation from beginning to end.

502
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:20,970
Speaker 1: but the pace of the book is such that Everything is constantly at every moment getting more and more intense more and more out of control more and more difficult to deal with.

503
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:22,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, it definitely.

504
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:33,079
Speaker 0: it feels pretty awesome just to read it because you you know You keep turning the pages at the same rate and things are just getting Exponentially worse and crazier and worse and crazier and worse.

505
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:34,222
Speaker 0: and it it's.

506
00:32:34,563 --> 00:32:36,969
Speaker 0: it's sort of like you're on this ride and you can't stop it.

507
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:40,390
Speaker 1: It's kind of like really this is really off the wall.

508
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:48,205
Speaker 1: But it's kind of like watching the movie strange days Because strange days starts out very slow kind of a mystery detectives police whatever and the.

509
00:32:48,285 --> 00:32:54,710
Speaker 1: it's the pace of the story Just accelerates and accelerates and accelerates and the plot just gets more and more and more out of control.

510
00:32:55,231 --> 00:33:00,550
Speaker 1: Until you gave you get to the end of the movie you you kind of lose track of just how far you've come.

511
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the books the same way.

512
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:07,537
Speaker 1: by the end of this you're in a place that you never would have expected this book to Go, I've never seen strange days.

513
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,300
Speaker 0: I don't even know what it is.

514
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,054
Speaker 0: But I really ace is also similar to that of Falling down.

515
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:12,656
Speaker 1: Yes.

516
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:13,399
Speaker 1: Yes.

517
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,968
Speaker 1: This is a lot like falling down only without.

518
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:17,413
Speaker 1: well You know what.

519
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:23,576
Speaker 1: the guy and falling down is a little bit like the dead in hooks run Actually just a tiny bit.

520
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:24,720
Speaker 0: dad and elks run.

521
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,024
Speaker 0: obviously I do not like.

522
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:30,741
Speaker 0: no the guy in falling down You can kind of go along with like where he's coming from.

523
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,210
Speaker 0: the dad and elks run is just wow your bad.

524
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:44,553
Speaker 1: well, I think the main difference is at the end of falling down the guy realizes when he says I'm the bad guy and In this the dead basically says I'm still right.

525
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:45,757
Speaker 0: I'm still right.

526
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:46,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

527
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically.

528
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,135
Speaker 0: Oh, we're not spoiling too much I don't think we really are.

529
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:58,310
Speaker 0: I don't think cuz I think even if we told you everything that happened And we're not gonna say specifically things that happen So you won't be really spoiled.

530
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:05,451
Speaker 0: But even if we told you the point of reading this I think is is the ride along the way and not so much Figure.

531
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:06,976
Speaker 0: it's not like a figuring it out.

532
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:09,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the one thing that really draws me.

533
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:11,110
Speaker 0: It's like being on a roller coaster.

534
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:16,489
Speaker 0: It's not a mystery that you're gonna get to the bottom of the hill scream a lot and then go up the next hill.

535
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:17,556
Speaker 0: It's all about.

536
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:20,763
Speaker 0: we're going down the hill real fast Ain't going whoo?

537
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:36,313
Speaker 1: but what really grabbed me is that you know, it's a roller coaster ride and all that but it draws you in and It gets to a point where if you're used to reading comics or manga or books or anything you feel like alright I know where this is gonna go I know what's gonna happen.

538
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:45,164
Speaker 1: like an event happens and after that event you think alright, they're gonna react to it in this way but then no one's gonna do anything and then this is gonna be remembered later.

539
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:57,089
Speaker 1: and then something, you know, and Basically the characters aren't stupid and the situation progresses very rapidly and every character just immediately does If not what I would do at least something that makes sense.

540
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:58,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, the situation progresses.

541
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:04,190
Speaker 0: there were a few times where they had that symptom of you know, like, oh, why don't you just do this?

542
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,076
Speaker 0: Ah, and it doesn't happen.

543
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:08,709
Speaker 0: and I'm a little upset even though it might happen later earlier.

544
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:12,328
Speaker 0: It just doesn't happen in like the exact way I wanted to.

545
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:15,630
Speaker 1: yeah But at least part of that is that they are kids and they really don't know what they're doing.

546
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:21,074
Speaker 0: But it doesn't happen in a way that just makes me put the book down and say fuck this shit that's just stupid but it's just.

547
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:38,129
Speaker 1: I expected a few tedious parts of the story to appear because they set themselves up like every other piece of media does where if this kind of thing happens then there's this kind of scene or this series of scenes before it's resolved and they basically Skip right over that and cut to the chase.

548
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:45,017
Speaker 0: I think what it is also is that whenever a thing happens instead of having the typical Expected series of scenes to resolve it.

549
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:54,830
Speaker 0: It's just the worst possible consequence immediately pops out Yeah, and then something out and then then you have to resolve that with the worst possible consequence.

550
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:56,556
Speaker 1: I mean, it's one answer the other.

551
00:35:56,837 --> 00:36:00,990
Speaker 1: it's kind of like how Rome fell in that there was no one factor that made Rome fall.

552
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:05,130
Speaker 1: There's no one factor that made what happens in this comic happen.

553
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:15,669
Speaker 1: It's that all these little things and all these stupid accidents just kind of all happened at the wrong time And as a result the whole thing just gets out of control.

554
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:30,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's mostly a combination of you know certain people have certain feelings and then certain opportunities arise and everyone sort of acts in their own interest and People are trying to control other people and they can't.

555
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:39,630
Speaker 1: and you know people get pissed off and then ah shit Yep, because if and if you look at it the whole thing stems back from like one of the first scenes.

556
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:41,659
Speaker 1: I mean all this starts when the kids.

557
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,010
Speaker 1: they aren't even trying they're not like they're trying to escape or anything.

558
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:50,221
Speaker 1: They just kind of go into the tunnel to hang out at night And then things just go out of control from that.

559
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,370
Speaker 1: keep saying out of control sort of like an Archduke Ferdinand.

560
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:56,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, except the Prussians don't come and save the day in this one.

561
00:36:56,623 --> 00:37:00,088
Speaker 1: No, no, I don't think save the day is the operative word for the Prussians did either.

562
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:09,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah the art in the book I mean, it's not like it's not something you're gonna sit in awe and look at like whoa.

563
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:10,090
Speaker 0: Look at that art.

564
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,334
Speaker 1: No, it's very functional art.

565
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,582
Speaker 1: It serves the purpose you get what's going on.

566
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:15,950
Speaker 1: It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't detract either.

567
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,463
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, it's not like, you know, it's it's not bad.

568
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,193
Speaker 0: Like I'm looking at it and I'm like, oh, that's terrible I can't even look at it.

569
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:26,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that, but the characters get really off model a lot all the time.

570
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:57,030
Speaker 0: Yeah I do notice a few things though that like there's really good Like coloring going on like they're out in the woods like you have all these bright colors and actually they'll draw the characters like with cleaner lines a lot more like a Newspaper comic strip and then like when things are all darkened in the tunnel they'll like sort of paint everyone with this really dark like washes and things and It definitely they do things with the art to go with the mood and enhance the storytelling.

571
00:37:57,614 --> 00:38:05,770
Speaker 0: but it's not art that is so Amazing and attractive to the eye that you want to put a poster on your wall because it's some amazing thing.

572
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:18,190
Speaker 1: Also, they do something interesting where there's a few there's a section in the middle where there's a bunch of flashbacks to the kids When they were younger kids before before they kind of realized what was going on and it's basically Archie at that point.

573
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:27,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it startled me for a second because when I first whenever I read a comic especially a one-off I always kind of flip through it just to get a sense of it before I read it.

574
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:34,657
Speaker 1: So I flipped through this and I opened to a random page and I see all this Archie and that really threw off my Expectations for what this was about.

575
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:35,882
Speaker 0: that'll super throw you off.

576
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:36,605
Speaker 1: Good God.

577
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:37,610
Speaker 1: It is not about that.

578
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,349
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

579
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,489
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess it could be about that if Archie was actually a serial killer at the whole time and he never realized it.

580
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean yeah, that would make Archie awesome.

581
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,850
Speaker 1: It would think about that.

582
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:56,910
Speaker 0: Okay, it does show you how they change the style of art to serve the story as opposed to Serving awesome amazing art or anything.

583
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus the wind is fire.

584
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,145
Speaker 0: the way they get the fire in there.

585
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,390
Speaker 0: The fire looks really cool.

586
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:09,928
Speaker 1: Yeah I must say the way it's painted in there and I gotta say the art does do work very well at the end because there Is a scene like near the end.

587
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:13,250
Speaker 1: It's kind of like the end of Lord of the Flies.

588
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:27,050
Speaker 1: Well, remember you actually know anything about Lord of the Flies did the same thing Where the story starts out very slow and methodical and the pace of the bad things that are happening are Just increasing and increasing and increasing and brings you to this feverish pace.

589
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:31,527
Speaker 1: And then the end of Lord of the Flies is suddenly all the I'm gonna ruin Lord of the Flies.

590
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:34,190
Speaker 1: Oh shit statute of limitations.

591
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,793
Speaker 1: I think all the kids spill

592
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:36,054
Speaker 0: out

593
00:39:36,615 --> 00:40:00,554
Speaker 1: and there's an adult standing there because he's on the island and suddenly like the cameras just zoomed in and everything's going so fast and suddenly the camera zooms out and you're back in the real world and You're back in normal time and there's this moment of Wow, I came this far this story came this far and you finally get a moment of relief when things finally get resolved and It's a very palpable moment of relief.

594
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:06,315
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Another thing is I think the story has the way it's painted and stuff.

595
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:07,960
Speaker 0: The lighting is actually really cool.

596
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,960
Speaker 0: It is it is it's you know, the characters are drawn kind of like not the greatest designs in the universe.

597
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,320
Speaker 0: I mean you can recognize which character is which but there's not like super facial expressions going on or anything.

598
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:32,196
Speaker 0: But when there's lights and things it's always like the contrast is like, ooh, look at that You know You can tell like light shining through in caves and shining through windows and all different colors of light.

599
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:34,983
Speaker 0: It works pretty well All right.

600
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:35,706
Speaker 1: Yep.

601
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:42,646
Speaker 1: Also, I'll just point out that I guess the moral or the lesson learned from this is Pretty much right along my thinking.

602
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:45,756
Speaker 1: it was definitely a validation of things that I believe.

603
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:56,949
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Definitely whatever this comic is trying to say whatever you think whatever you think is trying to say after you read it I mean I can tell you what I think is trying to say Well, as long as you don't think yeah those fucking kids.

604
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:57,892
Speaker 1: It's all their fault.

605
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:07,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as you don't think that but Yeah, it is definitely Agreeable, you know and it's also because it's so agreeable.

606
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:11,699
Speaker 0: It's like the guy riding it knows what I think and he thinks the same thing.

607
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:18,200
Speaker 0: So he purposely puts things in that like especially in the earlier parts that like piss him off and he knows they'll piss me off.

608
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:24,467
Speaker 1: Yep There's a lot of little bits little knits where a Character does or says something and it just goes.

609
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:32,852
Speaker 1: so against everything that I believe in everything that I am and it's obvious that he's very Deliberately vilifying the characters that he wants you to not like.

610
00:41:32,892 --> 00:41:32,932
Speaker 1: He

611
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:51,870
Speaker 0: basically makes the people so He vilifies them so perfectly that it's like an instant bad guy Like you'll read like a superhero comic and they'll be like this evil looking dark guy who's fighting the superhero And you won't hate that guy even 1,000th as much as you hate some of the people in this thing.

612
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Magneto.

613
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:56,512
Speaker 0: Hey, you can be kind of cool Magneto I feel sorry.

614
00:41:56,552 --> 00:42:02,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like The man yeah, but like the normal guy on the street.

615
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:05,306
Speaker 0: and this is like fuck you asshole God damn that guy.

616
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:06,450
Speaker 0: I hope he dies right now.

617
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,400
Speaker 0: I hope he dies before he was even in the book at all.

618
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:20,738
Speaker 1: Yeah I gotta say there are some characters that when they get if and when certain characters get what's coming to them I actually stopped and in a moment, I thought it's about time damn straight.

619
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:23,046
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and it's only eight issues.

620
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:30,213
Speaker 0: So, you know, even though you might be suffering for like maybe 20 minutes You'll read this whole thing in one shot and you'll you at the end.

621
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:31,960
Speaker 0: you won't be a roller coaster.

622
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:36,278
Speaker 1: It pulls you to the top it throws you down and then it's over and you're walking back to the car.
