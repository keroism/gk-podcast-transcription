1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,697
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, June 18th.

2
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:12,700
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,881 --> 00:00:13,402
Speaker 0: I'm Rim.

4
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:15,107
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:19,777
Speaker 1: Tonight, the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art Arts Festival 2008.

6
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:20,398
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,974
Speaker 1: So you know Frank Miller?

8
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:34,584
Speaker 0: I know him personally, in fact.

9
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:38,280
Speaker 1: Sin City, 300, Dark Night Returns, famous comic writer.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,550
Speaker 1: You know, everyone knows who he is now, right?

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,262
Speaker 1: Even if you didn't know who he was a few years ago.

12
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:42,564
Speaker 1: Anyway.

13
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:58,532
Speaker 0: Actually, it's funny because Ananth was reading The Prince of Nothing at our recommendation, and he basically, his question to me after he'd gotten a little bit into it was, "All right, I've only met one woman in this book so far, and I gotta ask you, is this guy pulling a Frank

14
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:58,893
Speaker 0: Miller?".

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,040
Speaker 1: No.

16
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,328
Speaker 0: My answer was not all the way.

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:14,686
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Frank Miller, you know, people always talk about his famous works and one of his most famous works is Frank Miller's Daredevil.

18
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,399
Speaker 1: And it's not, you know, he didn't invent Daredevil.

19
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,535
Speaker 1: Daredevil existed for a long time before Frank Miller did it.

20
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:26,723
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's his run, you know, from this issue to this issue was when Frank Miller was working on it, right?

21
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:32,147
Speaker 1: So you can actually buy all of these issues in one giant book for like $100.

22
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:32,971
Speaker 1: But I was like, "Fuck that

23
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:33,252
Speaker 1: shit.".

24
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,895
Speaker 1: You could also buy in three separate trades, but those trades are sort of out of print and old.

25
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:42,351
Speaker 1: But I managed to get them from some guy, so I'm all right.

26
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,957
Speaker 1: So I'm reading these.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,879
Speaker 1: And the first trade, I didn't realize, is when Frank Miller was doing the art but not the writing.

28
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,913
Speaker 1: And it's pretty much Stan Lee's style.

29
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,306
Speaker 1: And it's not Stan Lee, but it's Stan Lee's style.

30
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:59,871
Speaker 1: And you've got I Hit You, You Little Guy, you've got narrations, you've got all that business, right?

31
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:03,795
Speaker 0: Nothing's worse than I Hit You, You Little Guy, with the picture of the guy hitting the little guy.

32
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:10,404
Speaker 1: The second and third trades, I mean, it's not the greatest thing ever, but you can definitely see.

33
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,937
Speaker 1: it's really cool, because you see this transformation.

34
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:17,720
Speaker 1: Like the first Frank Miller issue where he writes it is still pretty Stan Lee-erific.

35
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,836
Speaker 1: It's not as much as the ones before it, but it's still pretty heavy on there.

36
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,309
Speaker 1: Then it just keeps going more and more and more towards, you know, the Dark Knight Returns Frank Miller that you know.

37
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,193
Speaker 1: And then when you start to get to like the end of the second trade, it's like the second to last issue.

38
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:39,807
Speaker 1: And that second trade is like, ah, yeah.

39
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,817
Speaker 1: And then the third trade is sort of like, ah, he wraps it up.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,318
Speaker 1: So Daredevil, if people don't know out there, because he's not like, you know, super popular like Spider-Man, but I guess there was a movie, right?

41
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,697
Speaker 1: Anyway, Daredevil's about this blind lawyer who kicks people's asses, right?

42
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:00,354
Speaker 1: I'm on the train today reading the third trade, wrapping it up.

43
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:01,017
Speaker 1: I finished it.

44
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,349
Speaker 1: And sitting across from me, blind dude.

45
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,844
Speaker 1: And you know what's really cool is he had like this Braille machine.

46
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:16,998
Speaker 1: It was a really fascinating machine and it was quite amazing how fast he could operate this machine and read the Braills.

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,873
Speaker 1: I got to say, I want to get me one of those machines.

48
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:21,341
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

49
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,010
Speaker 1: It's just, it was a really fascinating machine.

50
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,090
Speaker 0: So that's the, oh man, I got something to talk about.

51
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,232
Speaker 0: Show.

52
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:28,177
Speaker 0: Yeah.

53
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:28,881
Speaker 1: I think about that.

54
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,213
Speaker 1: You're reading comic about a blind guy who can't see that.

55
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:34,311
Speaker 1: you're reading a comic about a blind guy and there's a blind guy.

56
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,478
Speaker 0: I don't know.

57
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:38,484
Speaker 0: It's not that far out of the realm.

58
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:41,357
Speaker 1: Hey, it's, you know, he had a really cool machine.

59
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:43,593
Speaker 1: I'm going to go figure out what that machine was and how it works.

60
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,720
Speaker 0: It was a Braille machine.

61
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:55,480
Speaker 1: I know, but like, it was weird because I had like these buttons up top, but it just had like, it had like, like nine buttons up top and they didn't really, it wasn't like a keyboard, but it's like, somehow he knew which ones to push.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,265
Speaker 1: They were unlabeled.

63
00:03:56,306 --> 00:04:02,036
Speaker 1: I guess it didn't matter if they were labeled or not, but you know, it was just buttons sort of arranged up there.

64
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:03,164
Speaker 1: And I was like, how did those work?

65
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:05,375
Speaker 1: And the thing switched up the Braille so quickly.

66
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:12,833
Speaker 1: It was like, it was, I really want to know, like, you know, sort of how it worked and what the principle behind it was and how it functioned.

67
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:13,477
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

68
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:23,612
Speaker 0: It's probably a lot like, I mean, I've heard there are these machines you can have with you if you're, if you're not blind, if you can see that we'll use electricity to change the arrangement of pixels, right?

69
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:27,065
Speaker 0: To show letters and it'll change those letters.

70
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:31,187
Speaker 0: It's kind of cryptic, but if you get used to all these letters in order, you can read stuff.

71
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:32,031
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, here we go.

72
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,586
Speaker 1: The nine key Braille machine on flicker.

73
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:36,812
Speaker 1: So I guess that's what that's.

74
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,199
Speaker 1: Let's see if that's okay.

75
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,367
Speaker 1: That's a really old fashioned machine, but I'm betting the machine he had was, uh, based on a similar principle.

76
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:48,674
Speaker 0: I imagine your thing of the day at some point in the near future is going to be the Braille machine.

77
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:53,183
Speaker 1: Once you learn about it and find a video may, I'm sure there's probably someone out there coming in blind.

78
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:54,250
Speaker 1: People can listen to podcasts.

79
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,172
Speaker 1: Sorry, deaf people.

80
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:01,882
Speaker 1: Um, and uh, perhaps someone out there is blind and will tell us all about awesome Braille machines.

81
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:04,156
Speaker 1: It had like a compact flash card and stuff in it.

82
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,048
Speaker 1: It was, it was definitely something cool going on.

83
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,316
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure it out though.

84
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:08,362
Speaker 1: And he was really fast.

85
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:15,360
Speaker 0: All right, so I'm going to pretty much jump right into my news because this is one of those, the internet had a tempest in a teapot about it.

86
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:22,687
Speaker 0: And mostly I just, wait, wait, teapots people losing their shit on the internet, their shit lost.

87
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:26,844
Speaker 1: I mean, if I had a penny for all the shit lost, I would not have to learn work.

88
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:32,012
Speaker 0: Well, uh, that wasn't quite true because if you had a penny for all of it, then you'd have a penny.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,630
Speaker 1: If I had one funny for each shit that was lost.

90
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,610
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Otacon pretty much the biggest and best anime convention.

91
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,380
Speaker 0: That's run by fans in America.

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,650
Speaker 0: It's, it's, it's, it's my favorite con lately.

93
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:52,673
Speaker 0: I've been saying that to a lot of the staffers of cons, but no Otacon is my favorite con.

94
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:53,116
Speaker 1: I don't know.

95
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:57,377
Speaker 1: I'm really, I don't think I have a con that is like the favorite con period.

96
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,030
Speaker 1: I have cons that are favorite in different ways.

97
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,775
Speaker 0: Katsu con is my favorite.

98
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,101
Speaker 0: be staff at it.

99
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,430
Speaker 0: Con Connecticut is my favorite.

100
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:08,142
Speaker 0: Let's go do a bunch of panels with very little planning.

101
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,312
Speaker 0: Con Otacon is my favorite.

102
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,259
Speaker 0: being at it for the entire weekend.

103
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,866
Speaker 1: Con partly because I haven't been to it yet, but I'm feeling packs is going to be my favorite.

104
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:19,995
Speaker 1: be at it for the weekend.

105
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:20,476
Speaker 1: I know.

106
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:23,606
Speaker 0: Plus Otacon has the promise of shore.

107
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,453
Speaker 0: afterward packs has the promise.

108
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,881
Speaker 1: That's not something you can attribute to Otacon.

109
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:31,154
Speaker 0: It's been so many years.

110
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,720
Speaker 0: I mean, from the day.

111
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:36,014
Speaker 1: packs is great because there's a space needle nearby.

112
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:42,420
Speaker 0: It's when we conceived the week of awesome, called it that immediately and then went forth and did it.

113
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:45,272
Speaker 0: The week of awesome is a week of awesome.

114
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:52,025
Speaker 1: I didn't say it wasn't a week of awesome, but the people at Otacon and the Otacon convention itself has nothing to do with that.

115
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,041
Speaker 1: They should not really know as, as much credit as they deserve.

116
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:59,161
Speaker 1: They do not deserve credit for it being awesome to go to a beach.

117
00:06:59,483 --> 00:06:59,724
Speaker 0: All right.

118
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,211
Speaker 0: They deserve credit for at least one.

119
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:03,258
Speaker 1: I mean, remember the beach.

120
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:06,508
Speaker 0: I did not say it is the best.

121
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:07,894
Speaker 0: It is my favorite con.

122
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:11,913
Speaker 0: My favorite con can have all sorts of factors like whether or not it was Tuesday.

123
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:23,266
Speaker 0: I guess, but even so man, a con on Tuesday, you're judging which con is your favorite based on nonconvention based on the overall experience that I'm at Otacon and Sunday at Otacon.

124
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,458
Speaker 1: That's like if I said, Oh, Mario's my favorite game.

125
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:26,766
Speaker 1: Cause it came out on a Tuesday.

126
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,675
Speaker 0: I think it is Sunday at Otacon.

127
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:34,722
Speaker 0: If you're not going to the beach for a week, afterward is kind of this back to work tomorrow.

128
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:38,478
Speaker 0: But if you're going to the beach after it, it's I'm going to the beach.

129
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:41,590
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think I've made my point.

130
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,212
Speaker 0: All right.

131
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,984
Speaker 0: So Otacon is pretty much this year.

132
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:54,013
Speaker 0: They've changed up a lot about the way to handle panels and the submission deadline for panels came and went, they had a nice web form and all the rules were pretty clear and cut and dry.

133
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:58,134
Speaker 0: And a little while ago, they started sending out their acceptance notices.

134
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:00,986
Speaker 1: They also send out no notices.

135
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,643
Speaker 0: They also started sending out their rejection notice.

136
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,313
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have sent out rejection notices.

137
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,395
Speaker 1: I want to put one notice on the website saying we sent out all the acceptances.

138
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,663
Speaker 1: If you didn't get one, you're rejected.

139
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:25,060
Speaker 0: This is probably a better way because one that now people who don't get a notification, because I think some of this, I mean, I don't have a lot of transparency into the system this time around, but you know, what if someone doesn't accept like, all right, we've accepted your panel.

140
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,772
Speaker 0: Then they decide not to do it or something.

141
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,161
Speaker 0: They don't confirm that they're going to do it.

142
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:35,947
Speaker 0: So you kind of, once you send an acceptance, it is confirmed, but you can at least send to all the people that you're definitely not going to let do a panel.

143
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,756
Speaker 0: Hey, you're not going to do a panel.

144
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,642
Speaker 0: Better luck next year.

145
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:54,403
Speaker 0: Now they sent a nice concise little email and there was a little bit of that explosion that I kind of expected on the Otacon forums, not nearly as much as I guess I kind of hoped for just because I love, you love a hubbub.

146
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:55,910
Speaker 0: I love internet hubbub.

147
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:59,713
Speaker 0: I love watching people just go crazy on the internet because there's nothing they can do.

148
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,126
Speaker 1: You're basically trolling by proxy in that case.

149
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:11,114
Speaker 1: Cause someone else did something that, you know, we'll get other people riled up and you're just, you're like a troll spectator in a way, but they're not even trying to get the reaction.

150
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:19,537
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, someone is going to do something that is not trolling, but we'll have a trollish effect and you just can't, you can't wait to see it happen.

151
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:23,980
Speaker 1: Cause it's like, it's like trolling when someone did it for you and they're not a troll.

152
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:29,081
Speaker 0: But anyway, the, the, the story here is that Otacon received about 175 applications.

153
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,562
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

154
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:34,630
Speaker 1: Cause they're, they have, they, you know, they have close to that many panels, right?

155
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,067
Speaker 0: Uh, they only, they're only going to have 70 panels.

156
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:38,710
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

157
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:39,212
Speaker 0: Yeah.

158
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:40,359
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good percentage.

159
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:41,566
Speaker 0: Little less than half.

160
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:42,089
Speaker 1: Yeah.

161
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:47,569
Speaker 1: I mean, uh, actually the, uh, the New York, uh, I forget which it was.

162
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:49,401
Speaker 1: I forget it was the Comic-Con of the anime festival.

163
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,456
Speaker 1: They had like 200 something panels is crazy.

164
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:51,757
Speaker 1: Yeah.

165
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:57,228
Speaker 0: However, most of them were pretty bad, pretty bad, but anyway, Otacon, the real, they're really changing it up.

166
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:04,663
Speaker 0: They're trying to make the panels better, raise the quality, make them more academic, make them more relevant, get rid of the lame panels.

167
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:08,099
Speaker 0: Don't keep a panel just because it's tradition to have this panel.

168
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:23,870
Speaker 0: And as a result, there, there wasn't the general outcry of a million people saying, Oh, I didn't get my panel, but I've seen a lot of here and there internet hubbub from specific people who kind of felt entitled to a panel that didn't get their panel.

169
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,925
Speaker 0: Allow me to read an excerpt from the Otacon forum.

170
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:32,952
Speaker 1: Oh, excerpts are excellent because now no one can say, Oh, you're just making stuff up or whatever.

171
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:33,755
Speaker 1: All right.

172
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:35,843
Speaker 0: Frankly, I am a bit upset.

173
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:41,813
Speaker 0: I'm part of a group that has run the digital fan subbing panel at Otacon every year since 2002.

174
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:42,256
Speaker 0: Uh, it's funny.

175
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:43,968
Speaker 0: That's actually the first year we ever did a panel.

176
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,602
Speaker 0: We have, we have a six year uninterrupted streak and you're rejecting the panel application this year.

177
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:54,280
Speaker 1: Actually, that's probably a good reason to reject because then now it's every year.

178
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,712
Speaker 0: Now this is when it gets, ever since his ham dang moved on from panels, we've had nothing but problems.

179
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,721
Speaker 0: This is an outrage.

180
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:07,977
Speaker 0: I can't believe this is how you treat the people who've literally helped build Otacon into what it is.

181
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:12,789
Speaker 0: Who can I about an appeal now?

182
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,815
Speaker 0: Now the answer to appeal was basically no.

183
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,969
Speaker 0: And then this wonderful followup was posted.

184
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:37,924
Speaker 0: That's being said, of course, the panel has evolved tremendously over the years, along with the evolution of digital fan subbing, digital fan subbing, and therefore piracy is the number one issue the anime industry is facing in this day and age to not have a panel dedicated to it puts you in league with anime expo, which is not a con.

185
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:39,914
Speaker 0: One would imagine you'd want to be associated with.

186
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:49,469
Speaker 0: We were actually planning on having a panel discussion with members from the industry attending and discussing the issues with the very experienced and influential fan suburbs participating.

187
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:54,353
Speaker 0: I'm certain your convention is making a mistake by not tackling this issue.

188
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,950
Speaker 0: If there's an explanation for why it was rejected, I'd like to hear it.

189
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:58,693
Speaker 0: Thanks.

190
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:00,743
Speaker 1: So is there an explanation?

191
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,214
Speaker 0: Oh, are there explanations?

192
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:03,858
Speaker 1: All right.

193
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:12,740
Speaker 0: You're going to read the man, Jim Vowels, the man, you might know him as alabaster in the forums, but I don't want to, I use the word favorite a lot so far today.

194
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,728
Speaker 0: You know, this is my favorite count.

195
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:14,050
Speaker 0: Whatever.

196
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:18,076
Speaker 0: I think Jim Vowels is my favorite con staffer in the entire history of con staff.

197
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:18,539
Speaker 1: I'll agree.

198
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,287
Speaker 1: I'll agree with that guys, but he didn't invent the beach.

199
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:31,727
Speaker 0: I want to read his statement because it pretty much sums up everything that is good about what Otacon is doing with panels this year.

200
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:48,086
Speaker 0: Quoth alabaster, aka Jim Vowels, one very good thing that's come out of the last few years is that we are seriously looking at balancing fan panels with more for want of a better word, serious academic panels, meteor subjects, tighter presentation, more credible panel leaders.

201
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,358
Speaker 0: These are all in the mix in the past.

202
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:55,811
Speaker 0: We've been criticized rightly for having too many of the Y show XYZ rocks panels.

203
00:12:56,633 --> 00:13:04,135
Speaker 0: I wonder if we were one of the prodding efforts here.

204
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:09,134
Speaker 0: Anyway, to continue I've attended some of these myself, though not at Otacon.

205
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:17,208
Speaker 0: There are few things more frustrating than being a far more qualified and informed person than the panelists on stage.

206
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:20,002
Speaker 0: I've had that happen to me on occasion, usually for Dr.

207
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,051
Speaker 0: Who related panels.

208
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:22,834
Speaker 1: Ah, bringing in the Dr.

209
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:23,236
Speaker 1: Who.

210
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:25,305
Speaker 1: That's definitely Jim Vowels, not an imposter.

211
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,620
Speaker 0: And you don't need three panels on the same general.

212
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,805
Speaker 0: why ninjas beat pirates?

213
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:30,388
Speaker 0: nonsense.

214
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,694
Speaker 1: That's true also.

215
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:36,422
Speaker 0: We have the ability to pick and choose and we were trying to build for diversity as much as anything.

216
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:40,120
Speaker 0: Lacking any other context, here's what I would rationally assume.

217
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,530
Speaker 0: This is referring to someone asking why their panel wasn't accepted pretty much in response to the wonderful person above.

218
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:51,734
Speaker 0: One, there was a better similar panel on offer from another panelist.

219
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:54,588
Speaker 0: Popular topics get a lot of submissions, yours might not have been the best.

220
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:59,370
Speaker 0: Number two, the subject matter wasn't relevant to the con's mission.

221
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:06,685
Speaker 0: Ninjas versus pirates is rather pointless, to use a silly example, and not particularly relevant outside of a discussion of One Piece.

222
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:11,089
Speaker 0: Internet memes, for example, are a waste of convention time and resources.

223
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,422
Speaker 0: I'll bet there's not going to be a 4chan panel.

224
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,599
Speaker 1: Those are best kept to the hallways, which is where they belong.

225
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:21,883
Speaker 1: And in fact, if not having them in the panels means more in the hallways, I'm all for it.

226
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:26,165
Speaker 1: Because hallway enjoyment of the memes is one of the pleasures of the Otacon.

227
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:31,050
Speaker 0: Three, your subject matter may have been deemed inappropriate or simply done to death.

228
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:36,400
Speaker 0: A why furries suck and why you should hate them panel, for example, is unlikely to get much traction.

229
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,870
Speaker 1: I think that's the one we're going here, is the done to death, as in there is a fan sub panel at every con.

230
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,748
Speaker 1: I mean, he himself said there's been one at Otacon for six years.

231
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,243
Speaker 1: Do we really need to have the same panel every single year?

232
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:49,457
Speaker 0: Subs versus dubs isn't worth arguing about anymore.

233
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:50,200
Speaker 0: Yeah?

234
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,276
Speaker 0: So yeah, but to go one step further, a lot of people were asking, and somewhat earnestly, why wasn't my panel submitted?

235
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,181
Speaker 0: Why didn't I get my panel?

236
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:58,845
Speaker 0: How am I God?

237
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:00,373
Speaker 0: What do I need to do better?

238
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:10,745
Speaker 0: And Meredith, the head of panels, who was also the head of panels last year, did a pretty damn good job considering the circumstances surrounding the panel situation last year at Otacon.

239
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,437
Speaker 0: Quote, be professional, not only in your application, but in all of your dealings with the panel staff.

240
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,880
Speaker 0: We hold the department to very high standards, both staff wise and panelists wise.

241
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,750
Speaker 1: Actually, despite your tone of voice, you know, that forum posed by the person was moderately professional.

242
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:26,955
Speaker 0: Which one?

243
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,865
Speaker 1: The one you read about the fan subbing panel.

244
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:29,750
Speaker 0: He had more to say.

245
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,112
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

246
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:33,669
Speaker 0: And remember, basically it was, he said this, people responded.

247
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:38,052
Speaker 0: He said it again with a little more, you know, blah, blah, blah, Anime Expo.

248
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:38,635
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

249
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:39,098
Speaker 0: Someone else.

250
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:41,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Anime Expo bit was an unprofessional bit right there.

251
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:42,937
Speaker 0: Yes.

252
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:46,013
Speaker 0: And then there were more similar discussions about this.

253
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,622
Speaker 1: That's a very fan boy thing to say.

254
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:51,684
Speaker 0: Plus, I'll point out, this is also posted from, I believe, Meredith from the staff.

255
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:58,020
Speaker 0: I wish I didn't have to say this, but please do not ask people to email us with requests to put your panel back on the schedule.

256
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:09,016
Speaker 0: I wish I didn't have to say this leads me to believe that a lot of people whose panels were not allowed or not accepted are getting all their friends to email the panels, people and bother them.

257
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,108
Speaker 0: I can't confirm that I'm reading into this statement.

258
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:14,445
Speaker 1: That is super unprofessional to be doing shit like that.

259
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:27,039
Speaker 0: Plus, honestly, looking at most of the people like this on the internet, on average, all the blog posts and people talking about how their panel was rejected and what an outrage it was did not look like the most confident or together panel producing people.

260
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:27,140
Speaker 1: Yeah.

261
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,626
Speaker 1: Here's here's a here.

262
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,625
Speaker 1: I'll use this to give a tiny lesson in professionalism from Scott.

263
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:39,454
Speaker 1: He who accepts no as an answer gracefully is much more likely to receive an answer of yes.

264
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:45,537
Speaker 0: Ah, but I think much more important is he who spells words right and respond correctly.

265
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:47,141
Speaker 0: Goddamn emails.

266
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, too.

267
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:48,948
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:51,699
Speaker 1: Are you done with your whatever?

269
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:51,960
Speaker 1: I'm

270
00:16:52,020 --> 00:17:04,795
Speaker 0: pretty much done with it because the end result is that Otacon is doing a big shakeup and it looks like they've gotten rid of a lot of panels that have kind of been around for a long time for no real good reason, other than the fact that they've been around for a long time.

271
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,425
Speaker 0: I mean, as far as I can tell there, I don't think there's going to be an anime club summit this year.

272
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,626
Speaker 0: I don't think there are going to be any podcasting panels, which is probably good.

273
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:21,337
Speaker 1: I mean, if I had an anime convention, if I was running one, I would not repeat any panel unless I thought I felt that there was something new that was going to be said.

274
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:32,292
Speaker 1: Like if I had, you know, a history of, uh, um, if I had history of guy in X panel last year, why would I have it this year?

275
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:36,415
Speaker 1: Has anything significantly changed in the history of guy next in the past year?

276
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,908
Speaker 1: Do you really need to do the same thing again?

277
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:40,135
Speaker 1: No, we could do something new.

278
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:59,882
Speaker 1: So, you know, even though that's a good panel, probably not two years in a row, in fact, once ever, you know, and there's something to be said for, well, different people would go to it, you know, and whatnot, but not the immediate next year, maybe a few years from now or something, you know, maybe you could switch it up, do history of me as a studio Ghibli instead.

279
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:12,670
Speaker 0: See, the thing is just basing my, my experiences at, I don't know, the dozens and dozens of anime cons I've been to for all these years, the majority of panels, just why I'm not talking about Otacon, but in general are usually pretty bad.

280
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:26,556
Speaker 0: And Otacon is in the, they're so rarely in the situation where they have such a wide group of people from whom to choose panels that there's no excuse for Otacon not to have the best of the best, the best that the fans have to offer.

281
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:33,216
Speaker 0: And this year with this shakeup and the way they're changing everything, I think these are going to be the best panels Otacon has ever had.

282
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:35,313
Speaker 0: And I don't think it's going to be amazing.

283
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:48,087
Speaker 0: I think it's just going to be a major improvement after one more year of this, because remember, as we learned last year, they're keeping a lot more track of who goes to what panels and how well they were received and how professional the panelists were and all that business.

284
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,679
Speaker 1: I think sadly, a lot of who goes to what panel doesn't have anything to do with how good the panel is.

285
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:57,218
Speaker 1: It has to do with the time, place and title of the panel.

286
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:01,140
Speaker 1: That's pretty much those three things combined are what determines panel attendance.

287
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,422
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

288
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:15,450
Speaker 0: But at the same time, you can normalize the data based on like, if you know the average attendance of a given generic Friday morning panel, then you can say, well, this Friday morning panel that normally Friday morning panels get 50 people.

289
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,965
Speaker 0: This one got 300 and there was a line out the door.

290
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:28,907
Speaker 1: Another thing I would do is if I was running a convention, I would, you can't really change the times so much or the rooms, but cause there's always going to be, you know, a panel at every time in every room, supposedly,

291
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:29,651
Speaker 0: but I would

292
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:34,412
Speaker 1: move the better titled panels to the less trafficked hours.

293
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:42,252
Speaker 1: So sort of even it out, you know, maybe someone, you know, if I put this really popular panel at the really good time, it'll be stupid full.

294
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,213
Speaker 1: It's much better to put that at the really shitty time or it'll be normal full.

295
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:49,595
Speaker 1: And then, you know, a less popular panel, but not a shitty panel.

296
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:53,256
Speaker 1: Cause I don't have any shitty panels, a less popular panel at the really good time.

297
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,507
Speaker 1: And then people would go to it because of the time.

298
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:01,620
Speaker 0: you say, I just feel like this year's Otakon in a lot of ways is going to transcend all previous Otakons.

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,563
Speaker 0: There's a lot of indications, like a lot of things have changed a lot of subtle things.

300
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,119
Speaker 0: And this panels thing is it's going to be a big deal.

301
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:18,649
Speaker 0: I think after this year and after we see how well this works starting in 2009, I think Otakon's panels are going to blow you out of the fucking water for better or for worse.

302
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:19,975
Speaker 1: Cause you know, who knows?

303
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:25,159
Speaker 1: I give mad props to anyone who actually has the balls to try to stir shit up.

304
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,476
Speaker 1: I mean, stuff doesn't get better unless you change it.

305
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:32,103
Speaker 1: And whenever you change anything, people always get upset because no, they don't like change.

306
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:35,320
Speaker 1: If someone has the balls to say, screw you, I'm changing it.

307
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:40,406
Speaker 1: Even if it turns out poorly, I give them the props anyway, because they had the balls to change.

308
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:47,827
Speaker 0: Despite change, always being unpopular changes, always a good example was that anime club summit, whatever that, you know, we were on since what, 2002 at Otakon.

309
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:53,000
Speaker 0: And then one year randomly, we were like, all right, we've done this panel forever.

310
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,588
Speaker 0: We're running a kinetic con.

311
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,197
Speaker 0: let's completely change it up.

312
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,987
Speaker 0: And it turned into this completely different panel that I think was a thousand times better format wise.

313
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:01,248
Speaker 0: Yep.

314
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,554
Speaker 0: All right.

315
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:02,836
Speaker 1: You done?

316
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,485
Speaker 0: I think I'm done though.

317
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:10,944
Speaker 0: I'm not going to announce it yet until we know the time, but I will say yes, we're doing a panel at Otakon in case all our listeners were wondering.

318
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:19,182
Speaker 0: I don't think it was the strongest of the, I don't know, 11 or 12 we offered to Otakon, but, uh, I think it'll go over really well.

319
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:19,624
Speaker 0: Yep.

320
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:20,548
Speaker 1: All right.

321
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:21,171
Speaker 1: So check this.

322
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:31,974
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm going to explain this a little bit because I'm sure some people out there still don't understand this, but when you buy comic books in the O S you buy, you know, usually one issue or a trade of a single title.

323
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:36,537
Speaker 1: So if Naruto was an American comic book, every month you'd buy an issue of Naruto.

324
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,154
Speaker 1: And then every few months you would buy a book of Naruto that has a whole bunch of the previous, like five or six issues in it.

325
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:46,029
Speaker 1: Right in Japan, it sort of works differently.

326
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:50,791
Speaker 1: They have these anthology magazines, they're magazines like, but they're big.

327
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:58,468
Speaker 1: So you would subscribe to Shonen Jump and every week Shonen Jump would come in the mail, or you could buy it in the newsstand every week.

328
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:07,958
Speaker 1: And in one Shonen Jump, you would get one issue of Dragon Ball, one issue of Naruto, one issue of One Piece, an issue of Death Note, et cetera, et cetera, right.

329
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,970
Speaker 1: Depending on which ones were in there that week.

330
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,043
Speaker 1: Cause not every single one is in there every week.

331
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:24,801
Speaker 1: And then eventually when there's enough issues of Shonen Jump, they print the ones that we read, the manga that we read in the U S such as the Tonko bond, which is, you know, we're just going to take the last, you know, six chapters of Death Note and put them in one book.

332
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:31,167
Speaker 1: So the problem here is that even though people might know a lot of manga titles, right.

333
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:34,966
Speaker 1: And you might know, you know, where certain ones were originally published.

334
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,414
Speaker 1: It's sort of hard.

335
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:44,953
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, okay, there's this manga title, which one of these magazines was originally in, which chapters were in which magazines.

336
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:48,129
Speaker 1: And it's, there are a lot of magazines, like a lot.

337
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,705
Speaker 1: And over the course of history, many of them have come and gone.

338
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:55,821
Speaker 1: And it's quite difficult to sort of sort this whole thing out.

339
00:22:55,962 --> 00:23:12,784
Speaker 1: Even on like Wikipedia's and anime news networks, this in for this sort of information is very, very, very incomplete, but apparently they have launched in Japan, uh, in Japan, the post-war Japanese Shonen and Shojo magazine database.

340
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,711
Speaker 1: It has listings for 1,221 magazines.

341
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:19,563
Speaker 1: And there's three parts.

342
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:25,850
Speaker 1: There's the era of post-war Shonen, Shojo magazines, monthly magazines, and as the weekly magazines.

343
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:29,642
Speaker 1: And, um, it's pretty awesome.

344
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:37,213
Speaker 1: Cause now we have like the most full database of which mangas were published, where and when that has ever existed.

345
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:39,949
Speaker 1: And this is going to be totally awesome and cool.

346
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:51,028
Speaker 1: And they need something like this for American comics because for American comics, pretty much, you know, you can get a lot of information, but there's still no really super complete databases.

347
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:56,400
Speaker 1: I mean, there's some sites that are working on it, like comic book DB, but that's sort of like the Wikipedia of comic books.

348
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,606
Speaker 1: You know, it's all human edited and there's nothing that's like super, super complete like this thing is.

349
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:03,814
Speaker 1: So I know very cool.

350
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:07,368
Speaker 1: I say, plus, I mean, 1,221 magazines.

351
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:11,465
Speaker 1: I can only name about like maybe 20 magazines if I try really hard.

352
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:15,664
Speaker 1: So the fact that there were 2,221, that's pretty fantastic.

353
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:19,771
Speaker 0: Oh, there's actually one more thing I should really talk about before we get into things of the day.

354
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,194
Speaker 0: All right.

355
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:24,694
Speaker 0: So just so you're all aware, Inuyasha is ending, right?

356
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:26,160
Speaker 0: The manga, the manga, the manga.

357
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,609
Speaker 0: It's going the anime.

358
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:28,031
Speaker 0: I don't know.

359
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:29,824
Speaker 0: I stopped watching it after like six episodes.

360
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,154
Speaker 1: I started watching it after one episode.

361
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,363
Speaker 0: I actually really liked it.

362
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:34,700
Speaker 0: The problem was it just, you know, it's Rumiko Takahashi.

363
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,543
Speaker 0: It goes on forever.

364
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:36,246
Speaker 1: Yeah.

365
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:38,737
Speaker 0: And I've already seen enough of her.

366
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:41,809
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's actually going to end.

367
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:45,329
Speaker 0: I'm probably going to pick up the last volume of it just to see how it ended.

368
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:46,980
Speaker 1: End in English or end in Japan?

369
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,750
Speaker 0: End in Japan.

370
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:48,178
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

371
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:48,983
Speaker 0: Obviously.

372
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:52,610
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be news that it's going to end in English because that would mean that we already knew.

373
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,134
Speaker 1: Well, it could be.

374
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,449
Speaker 1: the last English manga volume is coming out soon.

375
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,235
Speaker 1: That's a news.

376
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:57,766
Speaker 0: But we would have already known then.

377
00:24:57,786 --> 00:25:01,049
Speaker 0: Some would have already announced like they are now that, hey, it's ending in Japan.

378
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,693
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

379
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:02,116
Speaker 1: I guess.

380
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,160
Speaker 1: We might have missed it though.

381
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:04,021
Speaker 1: Anyway.

382
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:13,149
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

383
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,250
Speaker 0: I don't have much here.

384
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:19,394
Speaker 0: I got kind of a reserve thing that I'm saving for a rainy day, but I want to get right into mocha.

385
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:24,057
Speaker 0: So Emily showed me this opener to a TV series called Wok Fu.

386
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:27,695
Speaker 0: And apparently Wok Fu is a video game, some sort of tactical MMO.

387
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:34,846
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly what the deal is, but it's reminiscent of way back when we saw something called Eretz Waju.

388
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:40,123
Speaker 0: We found this and we thought that it was an anime.

389
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:50,798
Speaker 0: And back then, when we hadn't seen that much anime yet, and especially when we had enough time to watch every anime we came across, the opener looked like, oh, man, this show is going to be awesome.

390
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,929
Speaker 0: And we looked for it and we looked for it.

391
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:57,635
Speaker 0: And then a long time later, someone was like, oh, yeah, that was a shitty fighting game.

392
00:25:57,897 --> 00:25:58,761
Speaker 0: That wasn't a show.

393
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:01,756
Speaker 0: And we were like, well, was there a show based on the game?

394
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:02,439
Speaker 0: No.

395
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:02,962
Speaker 1: Yeah.

396
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:10,093
Speaker 1: Mostly the awesomeness of Eretz Waju was not actually what was in the video, but the music to the opener.

397
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:11,501
Speaker 0: That was a damn good song.

398
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,769
Speaker 1: It's still a damn good song.

399
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,370
Speaker 0: So, yeah, link to that if I can find it.

400
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:47,362
Speaker 0: But anyway, this instills a slightly similar feeling in me, except this time it actually is a TV series.

401
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:48,066
Speaker 0: It's a trailer.

402
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:48,970
Speaker 1: Oh, good.

403
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:54,942
Speaker 0: It's very fighty, but unlike the kind of fighting shows I hate, there's a small chance that it's fighty.

404
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:58,825
Speaker 0: in the there are choreographed fights that end and take less than an episode.

405
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,883
Speaker 1: That's the only kind of fight I could tolerate pretty much.

406
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:02,266
Speaker 1: Yeah.

407
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:08,737
Speaker 0: But imagine if they were like, if if Naruto had been otherwise the same, except no fight, no fight.

408
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:16,757
Speaker 0: And if there was a tournament, then the entire tournament lasted longer than 15 minutes, then the show would only be like five episodes.

409
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it would have been a great five episodes.

410
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:19,259
Speaker 1: It sure would have been.

411
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,643
Speaker 0: There would have been more characters talking to each other in a context outside of.

412
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:24,891
Speaker 0: Anyway.

413
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:25,453
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:26,196
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

415
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:27,200
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

416
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:27,741
Speaker 1: All right.

417
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:30,271
Speaker 1: So you probably know this.

418
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,225
Speaker 1: All my things today are things you probably know.

419
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,594
Speaker 1: And then elaborating on them.

420
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,028
Speaker 1: But Japan is the land of vending machines.

421
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:37,853
Speaker 1: Good God.

422
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:40,751
Speaker 1: Are they loaded with the vending machines of all shapes and sizes?

423
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:42,361
Speaker 0: I wish we had vending machines like that.

424
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,232
Speaker 0: I want to get coffee from a vending machine.

425
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:44,735
Speaker 0: Yep.

426
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:48,114
Speaker 0: But anyway, canned coffee, not not coffee in a star.

427
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:48,597
Speaker 1: There is some.

428
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:51,030
Speaker 1: you can get crazy things in vending machines.

429
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:53,545
Speaker 1: You can get normal things from crazy vending machines.

430
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:55,460
Speaker 1: You get crazy things from crazy vending machines.

431
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,628
Speaker 1: It's Japan is vending machine crazy.

432
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:04,153
Speaker 1: And some guy went to Vendex, which is the vending machine convention in Japan.

433
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:10,017
Speaker 1: And he brought back a bunch of pictures of crazy shit that's going down there.

434
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:11,608
Speaker 1: And that's my thing of the day.

435
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:15,356
Speaker 1: And he also sort of talks a little bit about the history of vending machines in Japan, which is also cool.

436
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,875
Speaker 1: But yet check out the crazy Japanese vending machines.

437
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:19,679
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

438
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,361
Speaker 0: It's pretty hot.

439
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:21,545
Speaker 1: Yes, it is pretty hot.

440
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:22,889
Speaker 1: All right.

441
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:35,157
Speaker 1: So two weeks ago, because we haven't been doing geek nights every week like we used to, we went to the Moka Art Festival, which is not a coffee art festival.

442
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:38,996
Speaker 1: It is the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art Art Festival.

443
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:40,203
Speaker 1: And no, that is not redundant.

444
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:47,504
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, most people when they sit like people don't seem to realize that Moka is a thing independent of the Moka Festival.

445
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,952
Speaker 1: The Moka is the museum.

446
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:51,647
Speaker 1: It is the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art is in New York.

447
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,156
Speaker 1: It is very close to my work.

448
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:55,170
Speaker 1: It's you should go there at least once.

449
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,591
Speaker 1: But usually you want to go there depending on what exhibition they have.

450
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:01,154
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not really a big museum, even though they do have a lot of material.

451
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,426
Speaker 1: It's not always all out, you know, but whatever.

452
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,967
Speaker 1: They are very good museum despite having very little physical space.

453
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:16,369
Speaker 1: And every year they make most of their money by having an art festival, which is perhaps one of the best comic conventions on earth.

454
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:17,515
Speaker 1: And it's in New York.

455
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:17,998
Speaker 1: And we go.

456
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,596
Speaker 1: we've been there the past three or four years, I think.

457
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:22,340
Speaker 1: I don't even remember.

458
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,807
Speaker 1: I think this is the third or fourth.

459
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:25,214
Speaker 1: I can't remember anyway.

460
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:26,782
Speaker 1: And it is awesome.

461
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,812
Speaker 1: And awesome things go down there.

462
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,840
Speaker 1: And it really seems like every year you go to the Moka and it's always the same but different.

463
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,374
Speaker 1: It's like you see the same people in the same places.

464
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:39,030
Speaker 1: But everyone always has something new to show you.

465
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,332
Speaker 0: For example, last year there was one big not for sale poop sign.

466
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:46,245
Speaker 0: This year there were a lot of little $8 poop signs.

467
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:47,650
Speaker 1: Oh, poop signs.

468
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:48,333
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

469
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:48,634
Speaker 1: Yep.

470
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:52,914
Speaker 1: And you know, some people have the same table in the same spot.

471
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:53,758
Speaker 1: Old trustee.

472
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,358
Speaker 1: But some people it's like a whole new person at a whole new table.

473
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:59,491
Speaker 1: And you go, oh, man, look at this completely new thing.

474
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,739
Speaker 1: And you could watch.

475
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:06,957
Speaker 1: It's weird because it's like we walk around for a few hours and really as great a convention as it is, it's still a comic convention.

476
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:09,652
Speaker 1: So it's pretty much look at all the tables, go home.

477
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,146
Speaker 1: You know, it's not really a reason to stick around.

478
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:16,207
Speaker 1: I mean, there are panels, but it's pretty much one panel at a time.

479
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:20,934
Speaker 1: So if there's one you really want to go to, then you should go to the convention when that one is happening.

480
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:23,273
Speaker 1: But you don't want to sit around and go to all of them.

481
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:27,861
Speaker 1: You'd be pretty bored eventually, unless you really, really liked all the panels, I guess.

482
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:28,163
Speaker 1: I don't know.

483
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:30,220
Speaker 1: I've never been to a panel at MOCA, so I can't say.

484
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:41,664
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's like you go to all the rooms and eventually after walking around all the rooms, you sort of feel like you've seen everything, even though you haven't seen everything and you really can't see everything.

485
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,301
Speaker 1: You feel like you've seen everything and you sort of you leave.

486
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:52,140
Speaker 1: But going year after year, it really becomes easier to see everything because a lot of stuff is like, I know everything you've got.

487
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,064
Speaker 1: I saw it last year.

488
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:53,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

489
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:57,567
Speaker 1: But what was at the MOCA were some pretty awesome things.

490
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:58,030
Speaker 1: Do you want to?

491
00:30:58,152 --> 00:30:59,804
Speaker 1: do you want to talk about some of the awesome things?

492
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:00,568
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

493
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,728
Speaker 0: I figure we wouldn't even bother talking about the awesome things we saw at MOCA.

494
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,453
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

495
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:08,411
Speaker 0: I think first and foremost, we have to point out that Jason was there.

496
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,555
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

497
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:13,815
Speaker 0: And actually, we happened to find the place where Jason was going to be.

498
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:16,933
Speaker 0: And we found that Jason was going to be doing a signing.

499
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:20,554
Speaker 0: We discovered that the signing was going to take place in like three minutes.

500
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:27,656
Speaker 0: So we just sort of stood there and we're looking around debating whether or not any number of the people we saw milling around were Jason.

501
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:27,998
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,746
Speaker 1: I mean, basically there's a guy.

503
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:32,860
Speaker 1: he lives in France, but he's from Norway, right?

504
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,744
Speaker 1: I think it's from Norway.

505
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:37,360
Speaker 1: And he makes the comics that we love the most.

506
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,438
Speaker 1: And he came to the US for this convention so awesomely.

507
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,475
Speaker 1: And we were like, oh, man, we're going to see the Jason guy.

508
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:43,804
Speaker 0: I mean, I think we reviewed.

509
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:44,750
Speaker 0: Why are you doing this?

510
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,225
Speaker 1: We should do an episode on all the Jason's together.

511
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:49,320
Speaker 0: I think we're going to have to do a Jason episode.

512
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,064
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

513
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:52,236
Speaker 1: And we only know his name is Jason.

514
00:31:52,437 --> 00:32:00,960
Speaker 1: And no one was wearing a name tag, but we knew it was at the fan of graphics booth and we knew that Jason was doing a signing in like 10 minutes.

515
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,144
Speaker 1: So he couldn't be far away and he wasn't sitting at the signing table at that moment.

516
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:06,995
Speaker 1: So we're like, is it that guy?

517
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:07,457
Speaker 1: I don't know.

518
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:08,242
Speaker 1: Is it that guy?

519
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:08,726
Speaker 1: I don't know.

520
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:11,323
Speaker 1: And I'm looking at all the Jason books they have available.

521
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,678
Speaker 1: And I said, I'm going to buy all the Jason books.

522
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:14,342
Speaker 1: I don't have.

523
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:20,327
Speaker 1: The problem was I had preordered a Jason book, but I did not know which one I had preordered.

524
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:24,488
Speaker 1: And of the books on the table, there were three I did not own.

525
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:27,001
Speaker 1: And I was like, I know I've preordered one of these.

526
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,878
Speaker 1: So we bought two of them and we guessed wrong.

527
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:33,320
Speaker 1: So now we're going to have doubles of one of the books, which is perfectly fine.

528
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,170
Speaker 1: And we have none of one of the other books.

529
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,323
Speaker 0: I have so little to say about Jason.

530
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:40,258
Speaker 0: that is not outright praise, if not hero worship.

531
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:41,362
Speaker 1: Yes, something like that.

532
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,593
Speaker 1: But anyway, we bought.

533
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,105
Speaker 1: I forget which ones we bought, but we didn't buy.

534
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:51,548
Speaker 1: The Last Musketeer, which is probably by the cover is a robot holding a dude.

535
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,857
Speaker 1: And that's the one.

536
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:55,001
Speaker 1: I didn't preorder it.

537
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:57,673
Speaker 1: And I just, I love I didn't buy it.

538
00:32:57,693 --> 00:33:02,400
Speaker 0: So I need to get titles of his works because they're, you know, sometimes you want like Bocorano.

539
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,505
Speaker 0: The anime was a good example.

540
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:08,911
Speaker 0: where it's like the opening song or the title or something like that has a phrase.

541
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:16,049
Speaker 0: And then it has meaning after you've seen the whole work that you didn't expect or that is much more profound than I guess would have been warranted.

542
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,683
Speaker 1: That's how a title is supposed to be.

543
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:20,350
Speaker 0: Not a lot of times it's not.

544
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,891
Speaker 0: I mean, Hamlet is about a guy named Shakespeare wasn't about the titles.

545
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:25,956
Speaker 1: He wasn't.

546
00:33:25,996 --> 00:33:28,934
Speaker 1: He wasn't selling it on his shelf with a big title on the side.

547
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:30,061
Speaker 1: He was putting it in a theater.

548
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:31,690
Speaker 1: I was in a big circle.

549
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,374
Speaker 0: All right, fine.

550
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:35,590
Speaker 0: I picked one example, but a lot of a lot of books like the title is.

551
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:45,125
Speaker 0: But Jason's works, I mean, like the one that we picked up there that I read just recently, Hey, that was a good one.

552
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:46,232
Speaker 0: That was really sad, though.

553
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:55,440
Speaker 0: But the coolest thing is, Jason, this guy, I have so much respect for him even more so now, because when he does a signing, he's not just like, hey, here's a signing.

554
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:56,424
Speaker 0: Go away next.

555
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:57,688
Speaker 0: Hey, go away next.

556
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,814
Speaker 0: He pretty much sat there and drew an entire picture for every single person in line.

557
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:14,824
Speaker 1: I mean, he was it's sort of like he got in his groove on some of the people in front of us, you know, and he would basically draw like one of the characters in his style because he does sort of like these anthropomorphic but not furry characters.

558
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,842
Speaker 1: You know, everyone's like a dog man or a crow woman or whatever.

559
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:19,310
Speaker 0: I really like his style.

560
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:20,960
Speaker 1: I need your little stuff around it.

561
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,415
Speaker 1: And then he would be like, you know, sort of smile at you.

562
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:31,679
Speaker 1: Well, he first after he was finished drawing, he would sort of like put it out in front of him and pull his head back and sort of like, oh, yes, that is correct.

563
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,058
Speaker 1: Then he would like smile and then he would like give it to you.

564
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:39,871
Speaker 1: And the thing he was so like, it was weird because you read his comics and you try to figure out what kind of person he was.

565
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:45,620
Speaker 1: And I thought that he would be like an older kind of person, maybe sort of clever and kind of hey.

566
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,333
Speaker 1: But he was like relatively young, maybe 30 something, I guess.

567
00:34:49,877 --> 00:34:53,612
Speaker 1: And he was all quiet and shy and not saying much.

568
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:58,211
Speaker 0: He carries himself the way the characters in his works carry themselves.

569
00:34:58,813 --> 00:34:59,456
Speaker 1: That is true.

570
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:05,619
Speaker 0: It was not very short on words, but the words that are said are very meaningful.

571
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:14,180
Speaker 0: I didn't try to interview him or anything because he seemed very shy, but he's at the same time like, well, of course, Scott did something awesome.

572
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,409
Speaker 0: But Emily took up Hey, wait, you know, and he'd already been primed because of the way we talked to him a little bit.

573
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:25,374
Speaker 0: So he basically drew an entire new cover for Hey, wait inside of Hey, wait.

574
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:25,895
Speaker 0: Yep.

575
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:27,522
Speaker 1: No, but I gave him my.

576
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:32,071
Speaker 1: instead of giving him one of the books we just bought, I gave him the pirate sketchbook and it's like, draw pirate.

577
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,663
Speaker 1: And then he drew a Jason pirate.

578
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:42,674
Speaker 0: It was great because he stops and he's thinking for a and I think skies remarked, Oh no, we made him think.

579
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:44,844
Speaker 0: And then he starts drawing a pirate.

580
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:49,145
Speaker 0: And the cool thing is when he sketches, he doesn't sketch it.

581
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:53,891
Speaker 0: He's one of those people that's so rare where he just starts drawing and every line is exactly perfect.

582
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:56,666
Speaker 1: He just takes the pen, you know, screw the pencil.

583
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:58,936
Speaker 1: He just takes the pen and he draws a line.

584
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,345
Speaker 1: And then another line.

585
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:02,662
Speaker 1: I mean, like he thinks about each line before he draws it.

586
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:08,672
Speaker 1: And then he draws it like deliberately and correctly, but he just goes, eh, eh, eh.

587
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:15,590
Speaker 0: The coolest thing though, sometimes like he'll stop and look at something and then he'll like, you'll see him move the pen around over the paper without drawing.

588
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,179
Speaker 0: And he'll go like, nope.

589
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,732
Speaker 1: It's like, he's making like his practice lines in the air.

590
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,226
Speaker 0: And the funny, like he'll draw the character.

591
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:24,380
Speaker 0: And then it's especially with Scott's thing.

592
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,345
Speaker 0: Cause I think that was when he really got into his groove in terms of drawing for people.

593
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:32,036
Speaker 0: Cause then he did the same thing for Emily, where he finishes the character and then he stops, he looks at it.

594
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:39,495
Speaker 0: Then he adds like a little thing and then another little thing, like a little back palm tree and then he's like cloud tree, another cloud.

595
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:40,138
Speaker 1: Yep.

596
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,479
Speaker 1: He just started, started getting with the flavor, getting, uh, getting going on.

597
00:36:44,222 --> 00:36:50,452
Speaker 0: If nothing else though, I'm very glad that we're not alone in our love of Jason because the line was long and continuous.

598
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:53,185
Speaker 0: for what the three hours he was doing this.

599
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:53,648
Speaker 0: Yeah.

600
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:58,032
Speaker 1: And I'm sure he came back the next day and I think he had an event in Brooklyn on like Friday night.

601
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,380
Speaker 0: So I felt really bad.

602
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,565
Speaker 0: I don't remember who it was.

603
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:04,867
Speaker 0: The guy who had the spot next to him for that three hour interview blog.

604
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:05,028
Speaker 1: Yeah.

605
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,559
Speaker 1: There was a guy sitting next to him.

606
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,711
Speaker 1: What was the, what was the book that he was selling?

607
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,997
Speaker 0: Uh, belly button.

608
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:14,124
Speaker 1: So yes, it was something about the, like the bottom was belly button or something like, look it up.

609
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:17,407
Speaker 1: I'll go to the fan of graphics website, but it actually looked pretty cool.

610
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:17,769
Speaker 1: Yeah.

611
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:18,756
Speaker 1: It looked really cool.

612
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:29,872
Speaker 1: And it was like this giant book and it looked pretty impressive, but I didn't read it and I wasn't about to pay for it, you know, cause it was so large and rather expensive for something I didn't know much about.

613
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:39,396
Speaker 1: And, but the guy seemed like a cool guy and he was nice and he was sitting next to Jason, you know, with his belly button book and just, he had no line.

614
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,601
Speaker 1: No one was coming to see him.

615
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:48,535
Speaker 1: because you know, Jason was next to him and it was like, Oh, Oh, I feel bad for you, but I can't help you.

616
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:49,339
Speaker 0: It was funny though.

617
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,591
Speaker 0: Cause me, Scott and Emily get up to Jason and we're just like, we're basically, we're paralyzed with school girl giddiness.

618
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:57,263
Speaker 0: And we're like, we really like your works.

619
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:58,649
Speaker 0: They're so good.

620
00:37:58,669 --> 00:37:59,834
Speaker 0: Oh man.

621
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:02,466
Speaker 1: There's a poll on the side of the fan of graphics website.

622
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:05,243
Speaker 1: It says which of your favorite of Jason's recent books.

623
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,371
Speaker 0: All right.

624
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:07,693
Speaker 0: Enough.

625
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:08,516
Speaker 0: The hero worship.

626
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:09,319
Speaker 0: Jason is great.

627
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,083
Speaker 0: And we got to meet him.

628
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:10,968
Speaker 0: He drew stuff for us.

629
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:13,442
Speaker 0: Scott should scan in the pirate picture.

630
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,084
Speaker 1: I'll try.

631
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:14,888
Speaker 1: Oh man.

632
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:15,932
Speaker 1: It's a tough vote here.

633
00:38:15,952 --> 00:38:22,641
Speaker 1: Uh, 37 votes for, I killed Adolf Hitler 37 votes for left bank gang 27. for why are you doing this?

634
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:23,244
Speaker 0: Why are you doing?

635
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:24,250
Speaker 0: this is the best one.

636
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:29,111
Speaker 1: I know, uh, living in the dead 13 last musketeer nine meow, baby seven.

637
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:30,697
Speaker 0: All right.

638
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:34,359
Speaker 0: So anyway, the rest of mocha it's, they always break it up in the same kind of way.

639
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,960
Speaker 0: We're like, there's one area where it's all the web comics and like the internet.

640
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

641
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:41,596
Speaker 1: They got, they got three rooms going on is the big room.

642
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:44,912
Speaker 1: They sort of like the internet, cool web comic room.

643
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:48,988
Speaker 1: And as the upstairs room, which has added last year, right?

644
00:38:49,008 --> 00:39:02,189
Speaker 1: And things are sort of thematically arranged a bit like the big, oh, there's also the, the, the front room, the front room usually has the big publishers in it, except top shelf, which is in, uh, they have the bar in, in the big room.

645
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:06,850
Speaker 1: And then in the big room is just sort of like all the indie people all around.

646
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:13,447
Speaker 1: And then the upstairs room is sort of like, you know, it's, it's sort of upstairs room is sort of like the quirky kind of room.

647
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:22,369
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you got, uh, Vertigo, Vertigo, which is DC comics up there, but you've also got like just a guy who's not even selling comics is just like art.

648
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:25,565
Speaker 1: And then you've got like the foreign comics up there.

649
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:35,699
Speaker 1: Uh, and in the front of the upstairs, you've got like this, uh, sign, uh, sketch area where you buy tickets and then the famous people sit there and they'll sketch for you if you buy a ticket and it's pretty cool.

650
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:40,987
Speaker 1: But anyway, so do you want to sort of go room by room or do you want to go buy what we bought?

651
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:41,673
Speaker 1: or how do you want to do this?

652
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:47,364
Speaker 0: Let's just go buy impressions because I didn't buy a lot, but everything that I bought is absolutely high quality.

653
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,475
Speaker 1: One thing is last year I regretted it.

654
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:50,280
Speaker 1: I held back.

655
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,731
Speaker 1: I was like, I'm going to hold back.

656
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,048
Speaker 1: I'm only going to, you know, cause I was like, I'll pre-order it online.

657
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:54,532
Speaker 1: I'll hold back.

658
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:55,902
Speaker 1: I'll hold back this year.

659
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:56,467
Speaker 1: I'm like, you know what?

660
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:57,295
Speaker 1: I'm not holding back.

661
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:58,001
Speaker 1: I'm not holding the back.

662
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,281
Speaker 1: I'm going to buy, buy, buy, buy, because there's a lot of stuff in mocha.

663
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:02,827
Speaker 1: You can't get not at mocha.

664
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,198
Speaker 1: And, uh, I held back less than last year, but still I'm feeling like I didn't unleash enough.

665
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:10,062
Speaker 1: I should have bought more.

666
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:11,047
Speaker 1: I don't know.

667
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:15,165
Speaker 1: The thing is that if I buy more, I'll end up buying everything and I'll be poor.

668
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,872
Speaker 1: That's not a good thing.

669
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:19,541
Speaker 0: See, very pointedly.

670
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,912
Speaker 0: I didn't carry a lot of cash on me.

671
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:24,284
Speaker 1: I carried $300, but I didn't spend it all.

672
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,505
Speaker 1: Not even close, but I was pretty much just like, yeah, I'll buy it.

673
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:27,970
Speaker 1: Here's a 20.

674
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,293
Speaker 1: Good guy.

675
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:28,474
Speaker 0: Yeah.

676
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:35,193
Speaker 0: Pretty much the one thing about the mocha, if you ever go to it is that there is no way to go around in a group easily.

677
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:39,740
Speaker 0: You're pretty much going to have to split up and then meet back periodically and talk about the things you saw.

678
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,170
Speaker 1: You've got narrow aisles, you've got small tables, you've got multiple rooms and you've got a crowd.

679
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:47,625
Speaker 1: It's, you can't really go around with multiple people.

680
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,499
Speaker 1: You got to go around on your own looking at stuff.

681
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:59,917
Speaker 0: Plus, especially if you want to go see something that is popular, you'll pretty much, it'll be a four foot long table and there'll be like 10 people desperately pushing to try to be in front of that table

682
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:05,292
Speaker 1: blocking off the adjacent tables, you know, because they'll be going lining up horizontally because you can't line up vertical.

683
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:06,319
Speaker 1: You'll just bug.

684
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:10,784
Speaker 0: the aisles are so narrow and of course, everyone's got a gigantic bag full of swag.

685
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:11,206
Speaker 0: Yep.

686
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:16,561
Speaker 1: So you sort of go around and when you bump into people, you know, you're like, Hey, and then you sort of go check out what I got.

687
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:17,225
Speaker 1: What's up.

688
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:18,069
Speaker 1: How you doing?

689
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:18,652
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,080
Speaker 1: So the upstairs is kind of empty.

691
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,004
Speaker 0: Well, the upstairs is a big ballroom and it's, it's a much different, it's more airy.

692
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:25,293
Speaker 0: People seem to go up there to chill.

693
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:26,279
Speaker 0: There's a lot more.

694
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:30,586
Speaker 0: Now I don't want to say lower level, but more like just starting out independent stuff up there.

695
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:31,028
Speaker 0: Yep.

696
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:33,340
Speaker 1: Oh, we also, we met a listener there.

697
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:34,063
Speaker 1: Yeah.

698
00:41:34,123 --> 00:41:34,867
Speaker 0: Kind of randomly.

699
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,867
Speaker 0: It was a little bit of an ego stroke, but I'm standing there.

700
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:40,436
Speaker 1: Well, it was an RIT person.

701
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,026
Speaker 1: So the ego isn't stroked that heavily.

702
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,052
Speaker 0: It's still stroked.

703
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:50,182
Speaker 0: Anytime you're in a public place and you hear the words, excuse me, are you rim and sky of geek nights?

704
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:51,227
Speaker 0: Oh man.

705
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:52,373
Speaker 0: I listened to your show.

706
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,258
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

707
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:54,083
Speaker 0: I can't believe you're here.

708
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:56,842
Speaker 0: I forget what the guy's name was, but you were totally cool.

709
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:57,747
Speaker 1: He was a cool dude.

710
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:58,813
Speaker 1: He was an RIT dude.

711
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:00,262
Speaker 1: He knew what the score was.

712
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,751
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, RIT anime.

713
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:05,514
Speaker 0: And I was like, Oh, so the later years, blah, but no, he was the early years.

714
00:42:05,575 --> 00:42:08,371
Speaker 0: He was there from the administrations previous to us.

715
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:08,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

716
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:09,699
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

717
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:16,562
Speaker 1: It's like, I fully expect someone who is on RIT at the same time as us to found out about us, but someone who was there before us, it's sort of like, huh?

718
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:21,088
Speaker 1: Well, you know, while there is the connection, it's like the connection wasn't so strong.

719
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:22,394
Speaker 1: How did they, where?

720
00:42:22,877 --> 00:42:26,998
Speaker 0: from what I've gathered, we're, we're kind of legendary at RIT a little bit.

721
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:33,573
Speaker 0: And that like the people in the animal club still by and large, remember us, which is not altogether comforting.

722
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:34,658
Speaker 1: No, not really.

723
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:36,810
Speaker 1: Cause we don't even know who's an anime club anymore.

724
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:39,104
Speaker 0: I met the coming in administration.

725
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:39,787
Speaker 0: All right.

726
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:41,014
Speaker 1: Anyway.

727
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:41,376
Speaker 1: Okay.

728
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:43,006
Speaker 1: So let's start talking about some comics here.

729
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:43,409
Speaker 1: Yeah.

730
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,021
Speaker 0: Cause that's really the only way to go about this.

731
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:45,987
Speaker 0: I interviewed some people.

732
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:53,924
Speaker 0: I'll, I'll put some clips from random stuff that we didn't get a chance to read or review or anything yet at the end, just so you guys can get a, I don't know, more well-rounded mocha picture.

733
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:55,692
Speaker 1: All right.

734
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:56,939
Speaker 1: So later I'm going to start with this.

735
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:59,712
Speaker 1: I didn't, this isn't even something I bought, but chip kid.

736
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:03,734
Speaker 1: chip kid is like a, the world famous designer of book covers.

737
00:43:03,775 --> 00:43:09,522
Speaker 1: That's, you know, he does other things, but he's a super world famous mega rich designer guy in New York.

738
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:14,525
Speaker 1: And he, if you read the vertical mangas, he designs the covers on most of those.

739
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,056
Speaker 1: And he's awesome all around.

740
00:43:17,337 --> 00:43:19,928
Speaker 1: He did a signing at the New York comic con missed it.

741
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,478
Speaker 1: He did a panel at mocha.

742
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,221
Speaker 1: It was Sunday.

743
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:23,884
Speaker 1: We weren't there.

744
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:24,466
Speaker 1: Right.

745
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:30,671
Speaker 1: But he's doing a thing called bat manga, the secret history of Batman in Japan.

746
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:32,378
Speaker 0: I'm so excited about this.

747
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:33,845
Speaker 1: I was sorta iffy on it.

748
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,092
Speaker 1: I was like, do I really care?

749
00:43:35,554 --> 00:43:40,353
Speaker 1: But no, I have the free pamphlet from Pantheon books, right?

750
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:41,497
Speaker 1: About bat manga.

751
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,389
Speaker 1: It's like this it's, it's, it's this pamphlet thing.

752
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:44,901
Speaker 1: They were handing out at their booth for free.

753
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,304
Speaker 1: And that sort of gives you a sample of what this bat manga is going to be all about.

754
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:56,616
Speaker 1: And I, as soon as they handed me this pamphlet, I was like, Oh, I am in desperate need of the bat mongers.

755
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,644
Speaker 1: Give me, give me more, please.

756
00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:00,008
Speaker 1: Yes, I want.

757
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:03,140
Speaker 1: And, uh, I don't even know what to say.

758
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,192
Speaker 1: I mean, you've got Batman kicking a giant robot in the chest.

759
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:16,124
Speaker 1: Um, you've got Batman, a toy of Batman sitting in a metal tank with two turrets on it.

760
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,328
Speaker 1: What else can I say?

761
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:21,700
Speaker 1: This is the awesomeness, the super awesomeness.

762
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:22,764
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

763
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:23,267
Speaker 0: All right.

764
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:26,906
Speaker 0: So I have to talk about this because one, I read the comic already.

765
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:35,742
Speaker 0: We'll probably review it at some point, but two, this person did such a good job of getting someone like me to read his comic.

766
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,780
Speaker 0: Like this is a marketing success story as far as I'm concerned.

767
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

768
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:52,525
Speaker 1: There it's, it's weird because like I normally buy comics based on solicitations and the cover and the title, because you can't really pick out new comics any other way besides that, you know, unless you go to the store and look through them.

769
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:57,230
Speaker 1: But when you go to like mocha, the people who make the comics can sell them to you.

770
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:10,012
Speaker 1: And if someone who happens to be a comic artist is an amazing salesperson, they will often sell a disproportionate number of their comic, usually to me, because I am very gullible when it comes to comic sell salespeople.

771
00:45:10,092 --> 00:45:22,663
Speaker 1: But anyway, Mike Dawson, I mean, I, I was walking around and I like Dawson from, no, no, I see this big statue of Freddie Mercury, the kind of statue that you see in a comic book store.

772
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:23,548
Speaker 1: that would cost like $300.

773
00:45:23,548 --> 00:45:25,983
Speaker 0: But usually those things are of Batman.

774
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,975
Speaker 0: This one was a Freddie Mercury.

775
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:31,859
Speaker 0: They sell those at comic book stores, but I, well, I've never seen a statue of Freddie Mercury before.

776
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,429
Speaker 1: I had seen that statue in the past.

777
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:39,686
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't really go to comic book stores, but I've never seen a statue that big, a Freddie Mercury other than it's like a 12.

778
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:41,033
Speaker 1: It's a 12 inch, I think, or 16.

779
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:41,456
Speaker 1: It was 16 inch.

780
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,562
Speaker 1: All right.

781
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,740
Speaker 0: So of course I walk over because I am a huge fan of Queen.

782
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:52,863
Speaker 0: And of course I am presented with ready and me a coming of age Bohemian Rhapsody.

783
00:45:53,185 --> 00:46:06,950
Speaker 1: See this thing actually sort of surprised me because I sort of like a month or two ago, I said, you know, someone should make like a story or a comic or a movie about like someone who can channel the spirits of like old rockers that are dead.

784
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:14,271
Speaker 1: Like, like, you know, basically be possessed by John Lennon and play music and sing like John Lennon, or that's not what this is about.

785
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,706
Speaker 1: I know that's not what that is about, but it's like, wow.

786
00:46:16,968 --> 00:46:17,854
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of weird.

787
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:21,654
Speaker 1: I had the, a symbol, an idea about, you know, wait, wait, wait, wait.

788
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:22,659
Speaker 0: So you're saying, wow.

789
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:27,825
Speaker 0: It's so weird that had an idea and then a completely different idea was made into a comic.

790
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:36,975
Speaker 1: No, it's, it's, it's a somewhat relate, not in that these channeling spirits of dead rockers, but in that it happens to involve Freddie Mercury rock and roll comic going on.

791
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:38,582
Speaker 0: That's a bit of a stretch.

792
00:46:38,602 --> 00:46:39,868
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of rock and roll.

793
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:49,211
Speaker 0: I feel like I'm getting a C. you were writing, I don't know, a comic or maybe a screenplay or a movie or a, or a, or a video game.

794
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:50,478
Speaker 0: Maybe you were writing a video game.

795
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:51,342
Speaker 0: I can cold read.

796
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,108
Speaker 0: You see anyway.

797
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:55,396
Speaker 0: Mike Dawson.

798
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:56,661
Speaker 1: This is my book, Freddy and me.

799
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:59,310
Speaker 1: It's about my obsession with the band.

800
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,321
Speaker 1: queen starts in 1984 with the song.

801
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:03,085
Speaker 1: I want to break free.

802
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:12,814
Speaker 1: Uh, and it goes on up through to 2003 with the, uh, with the questionable taste, uh, musical they had in London, which I went to go and see, and that's where the book ends.

803
00:47:13,217 --> 00:47:17,967
Speaker 1: But it also like the whole, the whole idea is that like, you know, a story about me moving from England to America.

804
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,464
Speaker 1: Um, it's really a lot to do with memory and identity, but it's sort of, it's a way to kind of hang the story on the structure of the queen songs.

805
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:29,142
Speaker 0: So Freddie and me is not about Freddie mercury.

806
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:31,292
Speaker 0: It is about Mike Dawson.

807
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:34,707
Speaker 0: It's an autobiographical comic about this guy and his life.

808
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,763
Speaker 0: And he talks a lot about memory and remembering things when you're a kid versus when you're an adult and perspective and that sort of thing.

809
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,049
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good stuff.

810
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:47,792
Speaker 0: It's just a good standup straight up laid back comic autobiography.

811
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:57,637
Speaker 0: And he happens to use Freddie mercury and queen's music as kind of this running thread through it because he was a fan of queen almost his entire life.

812
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:59,406
Speaker 0: And he was a fan of Freddie mercury's entire life.

813
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:05,393
Speaker 0: So the like songs from queen were very much linked with memories that he had.

814
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:11,100
Speaker 0: And that's kind of how he can remember all the events in his life is from these songs and this fandom.

815
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:20,170
Speaker 0: And of course it's not on the cover and you wouldn't get it until you actually read it, but it's also quite a bit about wham.

816
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,497
Speaker 1: Okay.

817
00:48:22,677 --> 00:48:22,978
Speaker 1: Yes.

818
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:24,487
Speaker 0: That actually makes a lot of sense.

819
00:48:24,507 --> 00:48:26,945
Speaker 1: I don't know much about wham, so I might miss a lot of really.

820
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:27,488
Speaker 1: Yeah.

821
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:31,069
Speaker 0: Oh, you, you should read the history of wham and, and how about?

822
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:33,927
Speaker 0: no, actually you should, because you should see who came out of wham.

823
00:48:33,967 --> 00:48:34,753
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised.

824
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:36,364
Speaker 0: I don't think you realize the whole story there.

825
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,799
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll read the Wikipedia that it's worth it.

826
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:45,344
Speaker 0: But anyway, I read the whole thing and this is, this is, this is what comics need more of.

827
00:48:45,746 --> 00:48:49,940
Speaker 0: It is not a stereotypical comic as in superhero, whatever.

828
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:54,379
Speaker 0: It is just an autobiography that happens to be in comic form.

829
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:56,167
Speaker 0: And I suits the medium very well.

830
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:58,217
Speaker 1: I got a lot of comic autobiographies.

831
00:48:58,278 --> 00:48:59,524
Speaker 1: I got fun home.

832
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:01,335
Speaker 0: If you read fun home, I haven't read it yet.

833
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:02,803
Speaker 1: I got, I got a couple others.

834
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:05,218
Speaker 1: I think I can't just, they're not coming to me right now.

835
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:07,131
Speaker 0: I just, I really, really enjoyed this.

836
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,842
Speaker 0: I'll review it at some point in more depth.

837
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:09,526
Speaker 1: I'll be reading that.

838
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:10,109
Speaker 1: All right.

839
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:10,834
Speaker 1: So check this out.

840
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:15,295
Speaker 1: There's a book called skyscrapers of the Midwest by Joshua Cotter.

841
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:16,280
Speaker 1: I haven't read it yet.

842
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,642
Speaker 1: All right.

843
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,009
Speaker 1: So I can't say much about it.

844
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:25,264
Speaker 1: All I know is that I knew the book was awesome and I knew I was going to buy it at some point, but it was only in a hard cover.

845
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:26,470
Speaker 1: so I didn't preorder it.

846
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:26,772
Speaker 1: Right.

847
00:49:26,832 --> 00:49:32,238
Speaker 1: And I was waiting for some sort of soft cover action, but I'd never seen the book and mocha.

848
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,408
Speaker 1: Josh Cotter was there and I saw the book.

849
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,524
Speaker 1: As soon as I saw the book, I said, Oh, Oh yeah.

850
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,031
Speaker 1: Just give me one of those.

851
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:44,230
Speaker 0: Do you realize how often that would happen to me at the mocha in general?

852
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:45,257
Speaker 0: I walk into a table.

853
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:45,981
Speaker 0: It's like, what's that?

854
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,265
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

855
00:49:47,305 --> 00:49:48,449
Speaker 0: And then I hand over a bunch of money.

856
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:57,285
Speaker 1: So here, let me, I'm flip open, uh, this skyscrapers of the Midwest and I'm going to pick something out of it.

857
00:49:57,809 --> 00:49:58,312
Speaker 1: Uh, let's see.

858
00:49:58,574 --> 00:49:59,661
Speaker 1: I haven't read this yet, so I don't know.

859
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:01,329
Speaker 1: Let's see the merit badge.

860
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:01,892
Speaker 1: Huh?

861
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:07,762
Speaker 1: There's a page here all about merit badges and there's pictures of them and there's descriptions next to each one.

862
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:08,044
Speaker 1: All right.

863
00:50:08,064 --> 00:50:10,583
Speaker 1: So let's see, I'm going to read two of these merit badges randomly.

864
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:13,095
Speaker 1: Uh, I did not prepare this in advance by the way.

865
00:50:13,718 --> 00:50:20,468
Speaker 1: So one of the merit badges is a picture of a bunny on it and it says next to it, bunnies hunt the little bastards down.

866
00:50:20,629 --> 00:50:21,835
Speaker 1: You are superior man.

867
00:50:22,136 --> 00:50:26,380
Speaker 1: Tear off their heads, stuff them with sawdust and Mount him on varnished wood with deer antlers.

868
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,303
Speaker 1: It'll be hilarious.

869
00:50:27,564 --> 00:50:28,587
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

870
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:29,229
Speaker 1: Okay.

871
00:50:29,671 --> 00:50:33,624
Speaker 1: Uh, shit taken at the bear badges, a picture of a roll of toilet paper.

872
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:37,157
Speaker 1: Lots of salty junk food.

873
00:50:37,398 --> 00:50:41,484
Speaker 1: Walk around in the woods in the middle of July with his stomach full of fatty, greasy crap and soda.

874
00:50:41,947 --> 00:50:43,756
Speaker 1: Get sick and relieve yourself behind a tree.

875
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:44,921
Speaker 1: Have others watch.

876
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:46,807
Speaker 1: Okay.

877
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:47,730
Speaker 0: All right then.

878
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:48,372
Speaker 0: All right.

879
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:52,568
Speaker 1: That was, this book really looks like it's a lot of random stuff.

880
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:56,003
Speaker 1: Like parts of it's comics, part of it's stuff like that.

881
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:59,477
Speaker 1: Part of it is like a giant robot picking up a house.

882
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:02,370
Speaker 1: Part of it is like pages from school yearbooks.

883
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:05,225
Speaker 1: It's really, it's really pretty interesting.

884
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:14,804
Speaker 0: That's one thing that's actually really cool about the mochas that you'll run into a lot of really experimental stuff or just stuff like.

885
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:18,104
Speaker 0: you've never seen a comic like this before and you don't know what this even is.

886
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:23,074
Speaker 1: It's like, I haven't read this, so I can't say more, but just holding it and flipping through it and feeling it.

887
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,642
Speaker 1: I know this is quality.

888
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:31,899
Speaker 1: and at the table next to Joshua Cotter, there was another guy who started sharing a table with him and he didn't look that interesting.

889
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:46,054
Speaker 1: I'm not going to be honest, but I don't want to insult him because actually I was very much lucky to notice him while I was there waiting for Josh Cotter to draw a little doodle in the front of the, he drew a little skull doodle in front of this skyscrapers of the Midwest.

890
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:48,301
Speaker 1: But what's this guy's name?

891
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:50,229
Speaker 1: Did he write his name in his book?

892
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:51,475
Speaker 1: Did he not?

893
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:52,399
Speaker 1: Oh, here I go.

894
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:53,242
Speaker 1: Joey Weiser.

895
00:51:53,362 --> 00:51:53,844
Speaker 1: There we go.

896
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,453
Speaker 1: Tragic-planet.com.

897
00:51:57,356 --> 00:52:03,192
Speaker 1: On his table was a little book called Cavemen in Space.

898
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:05,097
Speaker 1: How can you not buy that?

899
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:05,638
Speaker 0: I don't know.

900
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:06,902
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

901
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:09,958
Speaker 0: Half the things I see is how can you not buy that?

902
00:52:10,078 --> 00:52:10,983
Speaker 0: Like remember Teen Boat?

903
00:52:11,285 --> 00:52:13,799
Speaker 0: I bought Teen Boat because of that exact same feeling last year.

904
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,087
Speaker 0: How can you not buy Teen Boat?

905
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,899
Speaker 0: I should have bought the Teen Boat shirt.

906
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:18,768
Speaker 0: I forgot to and then we left.

907
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:19,551
Speaker 1: Teen Boat.

908
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:25,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, this Cavemen in Space is a little tiny mini comic and you could probably buy one from Joey Weiser.

909
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:33,087
Speaker 1: I don't know how else you're going to get it because it's not like something that's going to be in comic book stores, but it's a little full color, well-printed mini comic actually.

910
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:36,459
Speaker 1: And I got some chuckles from this.

911
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:46,441
Speaker 1: I mean, you basically have cavemen in space and a robot gets loose and they fight the robot and just sort of like, you know, that the plot itself, not so great.

912
00:52:46,562 --> 00:52:59,035
Speaker 1: You know, it's pretty, you know, straightforward, but the characters, even though there's maybe 10 pages in this thing and the little tiny jokes, you know, involving the characters were quite humorous.

913
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,024
Speaker 1: I'm glad I bought the Cavemen in Space.

914
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:04,178
Speaker 1: It gives me sort of a space wolf kind of vibe.

915
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:09,868
Speaker 0: I was about to say when you, when you introduce the concept, all I could think of was, uh, what's the guy's name?

916
00:53:09,968 --> 00:53:10,531
Speaker 0: Ansabel.

917
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:11,957
Speaker 1: I don't know.

918
00:53:11,977 --> 00:53:14,933
Speaker 0: Whatever his name was, he did space wolf.

919
00:53:14,953 --> 00:53:17,144
Speaker 0: He was the thing of the day, the last duet on earth, all that.

920
00:53:17,165 --> 00:53:19,314
Speaker 0: All right.

921
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:20,379
Speaker 1: You got anything else over there?

922
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:26,266
Speaker 0: Well, speaking of short comics or things like that, where you just have to buy it for the concept alone.

923
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:30,211
Speaker 0: Remember last year when I bought prison comics and they were utterly hilarious.

924
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:34,251
Speaker 1: That was two years ago, but yeah, they it was in the past previous mocha.

925
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:43,326
Speaker 0: I could not find prison comics this year, but Scott found something so similar, you know, short comic book about a very specific thing.

926
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,330
Speaker 0: And it was what?

927
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:44,953
Speaker 0: A dollar.

928
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:46,560
Speaker 1: It was a dollar.

929
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,283
Speaker 1: You are correct.

930
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:49,994
Speaker 0: What exactly was it called?

931
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:52,545
Speaker 1: Are you referring to the diarrhea diaries?

932
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:53,308
Speaker 0: I might be.

933
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:53,409
Speaker 1: Yeah.

934
00:53:53,992 --> 00:54:04,841
Speaker 1: See the, the thing that this has in common with the prison stories is that it's a comic consisting of multiple short, true stories, just sort of expressed in comic form for humor's sake.

935
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:08,581
Speaker 0: This is a genre, I guess that you see a lot of at things like the mocha.

936
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:13,666
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people who have like little seven page stapled together, 25 cent comics.

937
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:14,027
Speaker 0: Yep.

938
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:18,625
Speaker 1: It is a dollar and it's basically, let me, let me read the front, right?

939
00:54:18,665 --> 00:54:22,463
Speaker 1: The front page is a picture and it's of this guy.

940
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:24,734
Speaker 1: It's the guy who made the comic.

941
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:27,509
Speaker 1: He's sitting on a toilet with his pants on around his ankles.

942
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,239
Speaker 1: And he says, hi, my name is Phil.

943
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:35,994
Speaker 1: Throughout my life, I had problems with my bowel movements happening at inopportune times and I've crap myself a lot.

944
00:54:36,636 --> 00:54:38,243
Speaker 1: I'm sure most of you have stories as well.

945
00:54:38,263 --> 00:54:39,850
Speaker 1: Do you have enough to fill a book?

946
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:42,300
Speaker 1: So sit back and relax.

947
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:46,882
Speaker 1: And I hope you have as much fun reading my tales of gastric woe as I've had making them.

948
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:50,938
Speaker 0: that line, that line at the end is what we had to buy.

949
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:58,902
Speaker 1: And basically in this book are in comic form, three or four tales of gastric woe.

950
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:06,027
Speaker 1: And my favorite one is, is the second one that doesn't actually involve diarrhea.

951
00:55:06,951 --> 00:55:08,838
Speaker 1: The second one does not involve diarrhea.

952
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:09,119
Speaker 1: The second

953
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:27,663
Speaker 0: one is definitely the best one, but it is because many of you, it seems like this is more a, I guess, stereotypically guy thing, but many of you have been in this situation before I'm sure, or know someone who has been in the situation before or been in the situation of the second guy introduced in that comic.

954
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:30,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

955
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:32,861
Speaker 1: It is quite, I'm glad this is a dollar, a dollar.

956
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:35,109
Speaker 1: It was totally worth diarrhea diaries.

957
00:55:35,571 --> 00:55:36,133
Speaker 1: Thank you.

958
00:55:36,153 --> 00:55:39,442
Speaker 1: Uh, let's see, Phil, let's see.

959
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:39,903
Speaker 1: Oh no.

960
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:41,509
Speaker 1: Uh, fill me.

961
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,833
Speaker 1: Army is the story.

962
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:46,507
Speaker 1: Uh, Aaron de la Rosa and Mark Griffin did the artwork.

963
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,693
Speaker 1: This is issue.

964
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:50,786
Speaker 1: One is going to be an issue to go, man.

965
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:53,115
Speaker 1: I'm in for that for a dollar.

966
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:54,500
Speaker 1: I'll buy that for a dollar.

967
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:55,263
Speaker 0: All right.

968
00:55:55,283 --> 00:55:57,452
Speaker 0: So sun yen fi lock motherfuckers.

969
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,517
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

970
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:06,955
Speaker 0: I haven't even read this yet, so I can't endorse it, but the concept alone and also talking to God, to the guy was enough for me to buy it.

971
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:12,120
Speaker 0: Now, the thing is Scott actually pointed it out because he thought it was something else.

972
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:12,321
Speaker 1: Yeah.

973
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:23,763
Speaker 1: I was sitting, I'm just looking around and I see from far away, some letters on a comic that's standing up and I thought it said, uh, killing the quarter master, killing the quarter master, which I kind of looks like from a distance.

974
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:23,903
Speaker 1: Yeah.

975
00:56:23,944 --> 00:56:25,855
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Ooh, killing the quarter master.

976
00:56:25,975 --> 00:56:30,954
Speaker 0: I'm in walk this way, but no, it is killing tree quarterly by Keith McCleary.

977
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:45,564
Speaker 0: And it is a multicultural comic in the wild west with a Chinese assassin, a native American, a black dude, and a woman who's a former prostitute who go around killing people.

978
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:46,287
Speaker 1: Yeah.

979
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:47,874
Speaker 1: It's coming back in the wild west.

980
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:50,787
Speaker 1: Pretty much anyone, but white man was persecuted.

981
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:56,848
Speaker 1: So you got white woman, uh, native American, Chinese dude, and black guy.

982
00:56:57,812 --> 00:57:01,145
Speaker 1: And you just make them bad-ass heroes going around, killing everyone.

983
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:03,939
Speaker 1: And I read this and it was pretty awesome.

984
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:06,958
Speaker 0: I didn't read it yet, but talking to the guy, sold it, sold me on it.

985
00:57:06,978 --> 00:57:08,567
Speaker 1: The guy was a really good salesman.

986
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,558
Speaker 1: He was a really energetic, happy dude.

987
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,690
Speaker 1: He was, he's really good at pushing his comic.

988
00:57:12,711 --> 00:57:13,636
Speaker 1: So we totally bought it.

989
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:17,013
Speaker 1: Hey, my name is Keith McCleary and I'm here at mocha.

990
00:57:17,053 --> 00:57:27,715
Speaker 1: I'm doing it with a book called killing tree quarterly, which is a 50 page book about multicultural assassins working their way along the California coast in the late 1800s.

991
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:38,920
Speaker 1: And so it's a native American, a Chinese American, a retired hooker, and the son of a European and a black slave that are all working together.

992
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,053
Speaker 0: So is this your first big published work?

993
00:57:42,093 --> 00:57:43,020
Speaker 0: Have you done anything before?

994
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been working on this for about a year and a half and it's the original.

995
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:55,018
Speaker 1: Originally it was just a writer and I did graphic design work and I didn't know what to do about doing art for a comic.

996
00:57:55,058 --> 00:58:01,369
Speaker 1: And then a couple of years ago, I found out about a software called poser, which is 3d 3d software.

997
00:58:01,389 --> 00:58:05,653
Speaker 1: And so I do the book, all the characters are built in 3d and then the book put together in Photoshop.

998
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:07,021
Speaker 0: So pen never touches the page.

999
00:58:07,202 --> 00:58:07,966
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1000
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:11,223
Speaker 0: So where did the inspiration for this kind of idea come from?

1001
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:16,149
Speaker 0: Well, I was originally a film student and was trying to figure out how to do a first feature.

1002
00:58:16,169 --> 00:58:20,482
Speaker 1: And when you're trying to figure out how to do a first feature, it's got to be you and your friends and what you did yesterday.

1003
00:58:20,824 --> 00:58:26,047
Speaker 1: And I really wanted to do something multicultural and something that was not in the present.

1004
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:33,106
Speaker 1: And when I thought about doing something multicultural, I didn't want it to be kind of like a fake rainbow kind of thing like Barney and friends.

1005
00:58:33,227 --> 00:58:34,172
Speaker 0: So what could I do?

1006
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:34,997
Speaker 0: that was historical?

1007
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,325
Speaker 1: And I thought of the old west.

1008
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:38,015
Speaker 1: And so I did a lot of research.

1009
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:42,626
Speaker 1: I have some friends in San Francisco, so I went around to the museums there because I knew that's where the story would start.

1010
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:45,160
Speaker 1: And yeah, it kind of went from there.

1011
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,810
Speaker 1: So originally, it was going to be self-published.

1012
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:50,931
Speaker 0: And then I hooked up with Terminal Press, who are out of Long Island.

1013
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,465
Speaker 1: And I was doing some work for them.

1014
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,403
Speaker 1: And all of a sudden, they said, do you really want to self-publish?

1015
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:56,387
Speaker 1: And I said, no.

1016
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:00,514
Speaker 1: So I'm doing some more work for them this year that's going to be coming out of San Diego Con.

1017
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:01,767
Speaker 0: So how's the reception so far?

1018
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:04,546
Speaker 0: Do you think this is being-- I think it's cool.

1019
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:08,786
Speaker 1: I feel that the books that I like are always-- nobody has told me about them.

1020
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:09,853
Speaker 1: I go and I find them.

1021
00:59:10,276 --> 00:59:13,257
Speaker 1: And everybody that wanders over the table, it's like they didn't see anything else.

1022
00:59:13,298 --> 00:59:14,082
Speaker 1: They saw that book.

1023
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:15,810
Speaker 1: And then they walk away really fast.

1024
00:59:16,332 --> 00:59:21,786
Speaker 0: So I think I'm honing into the kind of book that I would want to read, which is what you want to do when you're making stuff.

1025
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:22,712
Speaker 0: All right.

1026
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:23,860
Speaker 0: So what else did we find?

1027
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,694
Speaker 1: So First Second is a company that publishes comics.

1028
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:32,086
Speaker 1: They publish things like American Born Chinese.

1029
00:59:32,628 --> 00:59:35,594
Speaker 1: They publish Klezmer.

1030
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:38,040
Speaker 1: They publish Laika.

1031
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,074
Speaker 1: They publish a lot of good books.

1032
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:45,534
Speaker 1: They sort of have this unique publishing format that they put out all their books in.

1033
00:59:45,575 --> 00:59:46,882
Speaker 1: And I really like it.

1034
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:49,434
Speaker 1: So they publish Robot Dreams, which I own.

1035
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,262
Speaker 1: So of course I went to their table.

1036
00:59:52,086 --> 00:59:53,392
Speaker 1: And what do they have there?

1037
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:55,100
Speaker 1: But they had Prince of Persia.

1038
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,307
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Prince of Persia?

1039
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,563
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering, is this related to the video game?

1040
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:00,216
Speaker 1: Because it doesn't look like the video game.

1041
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,229
Speaker 1: Are they just making something called Prince of Persia?

1042
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:02,792
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

1043
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:06,688
Speaker 1: But it is indeed licensed from the video game.

1044
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:12,976
Speaker 1: But it's not actually looking like the video game or directly related to the video game.

1045
01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:22,196
Speaker 1: It's basically like, hey, we'll license Prince of Persia and then make something that is not, you know, like just a direct port to comic form.

1046
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:24,892
Speaker 1: We'll actually just take the concept of Prince of Persia and make a comic.

1047
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:26,703
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good idea.

1048
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:29,134
Speaker 1: And I've got this little preview book here.

1049
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:29,878
Speaker 1: Right.

1050
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:31,887
Speaker 1: That sort of samples the Prince of Persia.

1051
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,639
Speaker 1: And I am buying the Prince of Persia.

1052
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:35,765
Speaker 1: No questions asked.

1053
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:36,931
Speaker 1: I can tell you that much.

1054
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:40,571
Speaker 1: Everyone should buy the Prince of Persia comic when it is available.

1055
01:00:40,893 --> 01:00:44,947
Speaker 1: It would be well worth your money if you are liking princes or Persia.

1056
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,176
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of Persians.

1057
01:00:48,918 --> 01:00:49,139
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1058
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,224
Speaker 1: But here, check it out.

1059
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:51,530
Speaker 1: Let's see.

1060
01:00:51,611 --> 01:01:01,080
Speaker 1: Prince of Persia, a publishing event, one hundred thousand dollar marketing campaign, one hundred and twenty five thousand copy first printing national consumer media advertising.

1061
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:03,571
Speaker 1: There's going to be a movie on June 16th.

1062
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:04,254
Speaker 1: Oh, nine.

1063
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:13,440
Speaker 1: Jerry Bruckheimer, directed by Mark Newell and distributed by Disney tie in marketing with the new video game in October 08, dedicated website and book trailer.

1064
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:15,389
Speaker 1: They're pushing this thing pretty big.

1065
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:18,887
Speaker 1: You will not be able to miss the Prince of Persia comic when it comes.

1066
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,615
Speaker 1: And you don't want to either.

1067
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:24,518
Speaker 1: So Prince of Persia for a second also is an excellent publisher.

1068
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:25,825
Speaker 1: You could buy anything they print.

1069
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:27,413
Speaker 1: Odds are it's going to be good.

1070
01:01:28,016 --> 01:01:31,794
Speaker 1: If nothing else, get American born Chinese and like and Klezmer.

1071
01:01:31,915 --> 01:01:32,498
Speaker 1: Those three.

1072
01:01:32,658 --> 01:01:35,253
Speaker 0: I'll warn you, I've only read one of these so far.

1073
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:35,997
Speaker 0: I have to read the rest.

1074
01:01:36,038 --> 01:01:43,411
Speaker 0: But like I mean, I often say that something is a tear jerker, that it made me cry like it was that times like 50.

1075
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:44,715
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1076
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,603
Speaker 1: Klezmer, I think, is the best of those.

1077
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,572
Speaker 1: But the other ones are no slouches.

1078
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:51,489
Speaker 1: And you can't go wrong with first second publishing.

1079
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:53,020
Speaker 1: And it's funny because it's sort of like.

1080
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:54,367
Speaker 1: it's very good pun.

1081
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:57,282
Speaker 1: The name of the publisher, it's like first second, right?

1082
01:01:57,623 --> 01:01:58,004
Speaker 1: F.I.R.

1083
01:01:58,085 --> 01:01:58,386
Speaker 1: S.T.

1084
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,032
Speaker 1: space as S.E.C.O.N.D.

1085
01:02:00,513 --> 01:02:04,309
Speaker 1: And their logo is a colon followed by a zero and a one.

1086
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:08,607
Speaker 1: So it's like the first second, but also first, second, third.

1087
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,093
Speaker 1: It's like I like it.

1088
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:11,438
Speaker 0: I see what you did there.

1089
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:11,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1090
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:12,622
Speaker 0: All right.

1091
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,110
Speaker 0: So I got to mention this at least briefly.

1092
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:20,512
Speaker 0: But Hairville looks pretty damn good based on what I saw.

1093
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:21,155
Speaker 0: I don't have it.

1094
01:02:21,276 --> 01:02:23,907
Speaker 0: I haven't read it, but I think it'll be good.

1095
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:26,217
Speaker 1: My name's Barry Deutsch.

1096
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:28,004
Speaker 1: I'm a cartoonist from Portland, Oregon.

1097
01:02:28,808 --> 01:02:30,113
Speaker 1: This is my comic, Hairville.

1098
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:39,069
Speaker 1: I consider it one of the top three or four comics about 11 year old Orthodox Jewish girls you'll find at this entire show.

1099
01:02:39,992 --> 01:02:41,176
Speaker 1: The comic's about Mirka.

1100
01:02:41,317 --> 01:02:44,793
Speaker 1: She's a girl being raised in a very traditional Jewish community.

1101
01:02:45,456 --> 01:02:47,667
Speaker 1: But what she wants to do is fight dragons.

1102
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,680
Speaker 1: And it's about the magical adventure she has.

1103
01:02:51,282 --> 01:02:57,325
Speaker 1: Hairville has been nominated for a Russ Manning Award this year for best comic book by a newcomer.

1104
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,696
Speaker 1: And it's about 57 pages long.

1105
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:04,850
Speaker 1: And you can view it at www.hairville.com.

1106
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:07,720
Speaker 0: So is this your first major published work?

1107
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,630
Speaker 0: Have you done anything before independent projects?

1108
01:03:09,992 --> 01:03:17,509
Speaker 1: Well, I've been a political cartoonist for many years, but this is my first comic book or my first one that's been gotten this far.

1109
01:03:17,891 --> 01:03:19,839
Speaker 1: And this is actually self-published for now.

1110
01:03:20,503 --> 01:03:25,326
Speaker 1: And it's available in two editions, the Basic Edition and the Way Over Price Edition.

1111
01:03:25,688 --> 01:03:32,338
Speaker 0: To read from something said about this by the Webcomics Examiner, the story is leisurely and steeped in cultural tradition.

1112
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:35,850
Speaker 0: Even troll killing must wait until after Shabbat rituals.

1113
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:37,696
Speaker 1: Okay.

1114
01:03:37,716 --> 01:03:39,402
Speaker 0: I like the style of it.

1115
01:03:39,422 --> 01:03:39,825
Speaker 1: Wait, Shabbat?

1116
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:40,609
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1117
01:03:40,669 --> 01:03:41,514
Speaker 0: I'm not Jewish.

1118
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:42,177
Speaker 1: Shabbat.

1119
01:03:42,398 --> 01:03:42,680
Speaker 1: Shabbat.

1120
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,350
Speaker 0: Well, when I think Shabbat, I think of the robot.

1121
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:48,242
Speaker 1: The robot's name is a OK.

1122
01:03:48,443 --> 01:03:49,748
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be OK.

1123
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:50,651
Speaker 1: OK.

1124
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:51,976
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1125
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:52,397
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1126
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:54,664
Speaker 1: That that sounds pretty cool to me.

1127
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:56,831
Speaker 1: Another thing is check this out.

1128
01:03:56,871 --> 01:03:57,072
Speaker 1: Right.

1129
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:03,357
Speaker 1: Oni Press, which also publishes all awesome comics, including Scott Pilgrim, among others.

1130
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:03,860
Speaker 1: Right.

1131
01:04:05,201 --> 01:04:10,303
Speaker 1: OK, so the Oni Press, they published this book a while ago called Side Scrollers.

1132
01:04:10,343 --> 01:04:13,160
Speaker 1: And the problem was the timing of the release of this book.

1133
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:24,677
Speaker 1: You see, it was at a point in time where I had recently purchased such comics as Aliens versus Cowboys and Pirates versus Ninjas and been disappointed in buying comics and also one called Random Encounter.

1134
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,879
Speaker 1: And I was disappointed in the results of buying comics based on the title.

1135
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,591
Speaker 1: So they came out with one called Side Scrollers.

1136
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:32,924
Speaker 1: And I said, I am not following for this again.

1137
01:04:32,944 --> 01:04:40,121
Speaker 1: I was a fool because they came out with this other comic called Saltwater Taffy, The Seaside Adventures of Jack and Benny.

1138
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:42,935
Speaker 1: And I preordered it and I had it in my hands.

1139
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:46,294
Speaker 1: And when I went to Mocha, I was walking around and I saw it on a table.

1140
01:04:46,897 --> 01:04:51,920
Speaker 1: And behind that table was a man wearing a centipede T-shirt whose name was Matthew Lux.

1141
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:57,705
Speaker 1: And he was the creator of the Saltwater Taffy and also the creator of the Side Scrollers comic.

1142
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:01,542
Speaker 1: And I had not at the time I had not read the comic.

1143
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:04,695
Speaker 1: So but we talked to him and he was really cool.

1144
01:05:05,217 --> 01:05:09,300
Speaker 1: And I got home and I read the Saltwater Taffy comic Seaside Adventures of Jack and Benny.

1145
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:14,076
Speaker 1: And I must say, the lobster action is perfection.

1146
01:05:14,397 --> 01:05:16,163
Speaker 1: It is the awesomeness and the fun.

1147
01:05:16,304 --> 01:05:22,148
Speaker 1: It's pretty much two kids go on vacation to the beach and awesome happens with giant lobsters.

1148
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:26,227
Speaker 1: I don't know how that isn't like a perfect sale of a comic.

1149
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,024
Speaker 1: And plus for a man wearing a centipede T-shirt, how can you say no?

1150
01:05:30,265 --> 01:05:31,451
Speaker 2: Hey, this is Matthew Lux.

1151
01:05:32,536 --> 01:05:34,104
Speaker 2: I'm doing comics with Oni Press.

1152
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:37,642
Speaker 2: I just had the book that just came out this month, Saltwater Taffy.

1153
01:05:37,963 --> 01:05:46,260
Speaker 2: It's an all ages book starring two kids, Jack and Benny, who are on vacation with their family in a small mysterious port town in Maine.

1154
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:54,619
Speaker 2: And it's about all the different adventures that they get into involving sea monsters, ghosts, different ghost stories, and giant animals.

1155
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:57,696
Speaker 2: And it's a lot of fun and it's going to be a series.

1156
01:05:57,736 --> 01:05:59,265
Speaker 2: The next one's coming out in September.

1157
01:05:59,808 --> 01:06:01,679
Speaker 0: All right, so how did you get into comics?

1158
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:03,028
Speaker 0: Did you always want to be a comic artist?

1159
01:06:03,048 --> 01:06:03,893
Speaker 0: Did you just fall into it?

1160
01:06:04,135 --> 01:06:05,763
Speaker 2: I did until I went to school.

1161
01:06:05,823 --> 01:06:07,670
Speaker 0: Then I wanted to be an illustrator.

1162
01:06:07,971 --> 01:06:13,135
Speaker 2: And then when I graduated, I realized I think I want to do comics again.

1163
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:15,948
Speaker 2: So I kind of had to reinvent my entire portfolio.

1164
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,900
Speaker 2: And eventually I was able to land.

1165
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:27,980
Speaker 2: I did a couple minis and I hooked up with Oni Press and I did my first book, F-Stop, which was written by Anthony Johnston of Wasteland fame.

1166
01:06:28,981 --> 01:06:33,137
Speaker 2: And after that, I was able to pitch my own stories with Oni.

1167
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:35,167
Speaker 2: And they totally went for it.

1168
01:06:35,509 --> 01:06:36,756
Speaker 2: And we've done two books.

1169
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:40,269
Speaker 2: My first book was Side Scrollers, which did pretty well.

1170
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:47,904
Speaker 2: And it made the top 10 list of greatest graphic novels for teens for the YALSA American Library Association.

1171
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:50,517
Speaker 0: So I can't help but notice the shirt.

1172
01:06:50,537 --> 01:06:51,863
Speaker 0: Now, our show, we're geek nights.

1173
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:53,453
Speaker 0: We talk about very geeky things.

1174
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:54,621
Speaker 2: Now, are you a geek?

1175
01:06:54,982 --> 01:06:55,304
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

1176
01:06:55,385 --> 01:06:56,671
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely would admit that.

1177
01:06:57,134 --> 01:07:00,090
Speaker 0: So video games, anime, like what geekeries are yours?

1178
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,640
Speaker 0: What are your non-drawing hobbies?

1179
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:03,551
Speaker 2: I like to get into a little bit.

1180
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:06,706
Speaker 2: I used to be a big video game fan, hence my centipede t-shirt.

1181
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:13,201
Speaker 2: I haven't really been able to get into games quite as much because I'm a little too busy doing comics right now.

1182
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:16,771
Speaker 2: But I do like to play the occasional game.

1183
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:20,364
Speaker 2: I'm down a few systems, though.

1184
01:07:20,464 --> 01:07:23,878
Speaker 2: My only system I have right now is a PS2, so I'm a little behind.

1185
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:36,647
Speaker 0: Speaking of a perfect sale, we ran into, we're walking around, and suddenly we see these boxes, little boxes, not big enough to be like what you would expect them to be, but they have the cover of Splatterhouse 3 on them.

1186
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:37,974
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "All

1187
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:38,215
Speaker 0: right.".

1188
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:42,133
Speaker 0: So we walk up, and we're like, "What's in those boxes?

1189
01:07:42,194 --> 01:07:42,596
Speaker 0: Are they for

1190
01:07:42,636 --> 01:07:42,977
Speaker 0: sale?".

1191
01:07:43,218 --> 01:07:44,203
Speaker 0: And they say, "Yes, they're for

1192
01:07:44,243 --> 01:07:44,544
Speaker 0: sale.".

1193
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:49,386
Speaker 0: And they open one up, and inside it, of all things, are cassette tapes.

1194
01:07:50,972 --> 01:07:55,310
Speaker 0: So we're like, "All right, you've shown us more information, yet you have elucidated

1195
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:55,893
Speaker 0: nothing.".

1196
01:07:55,913 --> 01:07:58,143
Speaker 0: So they explained.

1197
01:07:58,646 --> 01:08:02,799
Speaker 0: So we couldn't help but notice the cassette tapes in the Splatterhouse 3 box.

1198
01:08:03,381 --> 01:08:04,707
Speaker 2: So I'm Connor Stechsjoldi.

1199
01:08:04,988 --> 01:08:06,837
Speaker 2: This is our band Witch Head.

1200
01:08:06,857 --> 01:08:07,662
Speaker 2: It's our new tape.

1201
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:09,796
Speaker 2: It's called Melancholy and the Witchity Hatness.

1202
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:12,232
Speaker 2: We're pretty interested in obsolete media, I guess.

1203
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,039
Speaker 2: I think we're going to be putting out a VHS tape pretty soon.

1204
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,249
Speaker 1: All right, so top shelf, right?

1205
01:08:18,269 --> 01:08:23,096
Speaker 1: They always have the bar in the giant room every year, right, to set up their little display.

1206
01:08:23,216 --> 01:08:24,665
Speaker 1: They actually have so much stuff now.

1207
01:08:24,705 --> 01:08:37,206
Speaker 1: They had to put Andy Runt and the Owly guy down at a separate table, because they couldn't fit him up there with everything else, because he's got the hats, and he's got the plushies and everything going on.

1208
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:37,749
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

1209
01:08:38,412 --> 01:08:42,555
Speaker 1: But top shelf was handing out their seasonal sampler, which is pretty high quality.

1210
01:08:42,575 --> 01:08:45,973
Speaker 1: It's like this giant thing with a sample of pretty much all the top shelf goodies.

1211
01:08:46,857 --> 01:08:53,648
Speaker 1: And the cover of said seasonal sampler is drawn by someone you may be familiar with from Geek Night's episode pasts.

1212
01:08:54,572 --> 01:08:56,219
Speaker 1: You see, it is drawn by Mr.

1213
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,893
Speaker 1: Jeff Lemire of the Essex County fame.

1214
01:08:58,912 --> 01:09:01,729
Speaker 0: See, I was going to bring him up, because we actually talked to him too.

1215
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:06,935
Speaker 0: So it's a trilogy of books, and they're all set in the small town where I grew up in Canada.

1216
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:08,140
Speaker 0: And it's sort

1217
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,211
Speaker 2: of, while the setting, the town itself

1218
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:11,055
Speaker 1: is a real place,

1219
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:14,529
Speaker 3: and the characters and the stories are fictionalized.

1220
01:09:15,453 --> 01:09:31,011
Speaker 1: And I guess over the course of the three books, we sort of get to know one family in this town, and I think we go through four different generations of one family and kind of see reoccurring themes and relationships that affect later generations and so on.

1221
01:09:31,051 --> 01:09:33,964
Speaker 1: It's sort of a generation spanning family epic.

1222
01:09:35,288 --> 01:09:38,240
Speaker 0: So I guess, you personally are a hockey fan?

1223
01:09:38,859 --> 01:09:39,725
Speaker 1: I am indeed, yes.

1224
01:09:39,786 --> 01:09:40,752
Speaker 1: I'm a big hockey fan.

1225
01:09:41,134 --> 01:09:48,849
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, which is where I live, who unfortunately are pretty terrible, but you know, I'll stick by them.

1226
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:54,071
Speaker 1: And I grew up in near Windsor, which is across from Detroit.

1227
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:59,000
Speaker 0: So there's always a battle between the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs for fans there.

1228
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,606
Speaker 0: I'm actually from Detroit.

1229
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,384
Speaker 0: Turns out, he's a hockey fan, if you couldn't have guessed.

1230
01:10:04,565 --> 01:10:05,330
Speaker 1: Oh, guess, no.

1231
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:10,064
Speaker 1: So we talked to, we were basically sitting there looking, we're like, ah, the Essex County, there it is.

1232
01:10:10,446 --> 01:10:13,060
Speaker 1: And then Jeff Lemire, he's just like, yup, there it is.

1233
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,416
Speaker 1: And we're like, oh, you're the guy that happens at MOCA.

1234
01:10:16,477 --> 01:10:17,321
Speaker 1: a lot is you'll.

1235
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:23,598
Speaker 1: just because you realize at most comic conventions, right, you're buying comics from like a comic book store who set up.

1236
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:26,924
Speaker 1: So when you're buying a comic, you're not buying it from the person who made it.

1237
01:10:26,944 --> 01:10:28,799
Speaker 1: You're buying from a guy who sells comics at the MOCA.

1238
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:36,339
Speaker 0: Not only will you oftentimes hand your money to the author or the artist, but they will sign everything like as a matter of course.

1239
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:36,802
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1240
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:39,122
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like, I'll just take something and give them money.

1241
01:10:39,183 --> 01:10:41,060
Speaker 1: And they'll be like, do you want me to sign that or something?

1242
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:44,377
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, if you want to, I guess, you know, sure.

1243
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:44,940
Speaker 0: Go ahead.

1244
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:46,719
Speaker 0: I really like being at this thing.

1245
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:47,323
Speaker 1: Yes.

1246
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:49,963
Speaker 1: It's like you just be looking at something and then, oh, you're Jeff Lemire.

1247
01:10:50,265 --> 01:10:50,849
Speaker 1: How do you do?

1248
01:10:50,869 --> 01:10:52,539
Speaker 1: How's Canada these days?

1249
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,678
Speaker 1: No, but Jeff Lemire has all sorts of awesomeness going on.

1250
01:10:56,738 --> 01:10:59,195
Speaker 1: First of all, he had the third volume of Essex County.

1251
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:00,867
Speaker 1: There was a preview of it sitting there.

1252
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:02,137
Speaker 0: I'm really excited about it.

1253
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:02,761
Speaker 1: Excited about that.

1254
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:06,771
Speaker 1: He also had these two little mini comics that were like these tiny stories from Essex County.

1255
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:07,857
Speaker 1: They're really good.

1256
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:08,481
Speaker 1: Did you read them?

1257
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:08,883
Speaker 1: Yes.

1258
01:11:09,023 --> 01:11:09,365
Speaker 1: Okay.

1259
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:11,074
Speaker 0: The boxing one I liked the most.

1260
01:11:11,114 --> 01:11:11,596
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1261
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:13,626
Speaker 1: Also greatly enjoyed the boxing one.

1262
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:14,289
Speaker 0: It's weird.

1263
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:17,384
Speaker 0: Reading that little comic kind of made me want to box.

1264
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:20,096
Speaker 1: And we could, boxing's all right.

1265
01:11:20,116 --> 01:11:21,745
Speaker 0: You know, you want to get into boxing?

1266
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:22,490
Speaker 1: Not really.

1267
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:23,054
Speaker 1: Oh, come on.

1268
01:11:23,074 --> 01:11:23,578
Speaker 1: I like teeth.

1269
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:24,242
Speaker 0: Let's box.

1270
01:11:24,302 --> 01:11:25,167
Speaker 1: I like teeth.

1271
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:26,152
Speaker 0: You were the moth guard.

1272
01:11:26,172 --> 01:11:27,319
Speaker 0: That doesn't help.

1273
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:27,962
Speaker 0: Yes, it does.

1274
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:28,949
Speaker 0: You won't lose your teeth.

1275
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:30,720
Speaker 1: People lose their teeth anyway.

1276
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:33,780
Speaker 0: We wouldn't lose our teeth in the kind of boxing we would be doing.

1277
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,531
Speaker 1: Why do hockey players have missing teeth?

1278
01:11:35,672 --> 01:11:40,359
Speaker 0: They were like, you know, there's a difference between a fist that's padded and a puck.

1279
01:11:41,942 --> 01:11:43,629
Speaker 1: Now you lose teeth anyway.

1280
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:45,937
Speaker 1: So yeah, Jeff Lemire, the awesome.

1281
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:46,841
Speaker 1: All right.

1282
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:47,264
Speaker 1: I'm running.

1283
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:49,033
Speaker 1: I got a few, a little bits here, right?

1284
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:54,542
Speaker 1: So a while back image comics put out this comic called parade with fireworks.

1285
01:11:54,723 --> 01:12:09,054
Speaker 1: And it was like this really, like it was this really realistic sort of story of mafia in, you know, Italy, you know, it was really kind of hardcore and awesome, but I only got the first issue and it was only a two issue thing.

1286
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,262
Speaker 1: So I wasn't waiting for a trade.

1287
01:12:10,302 --> 01:12:11,450
Speaker 1: I was waiting for the second issue.

1288
01:12:12,014 --> 01:12:13,363
Speaker 1: And the second issue never showed up.

1289
01:12:13,866 --> 01:12:15,356
Speaker 1: I never saw it listed for pre-order.

1290
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:16,000
Speaker 1: I might've missed it.

1291
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,442
Speaker 1: Who knows?

1292
01:12:16,483 --> 01:12:17,167
Speaker 1: But I never got it.

1293
01:12:17,973 --> 01:12:20,452
Speaker 1: I knew there were only two issues because the first one said one of two.

1294
01:12:20,472 --> 01:12:21,701
Speaker 1: And I was desperate for that too.

1295
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:22,827
Speaker 1: Walking around the mocha.

1296
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,260
Speaker 1: I saw that too, sitting on a table.

1297
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,587
Speaker 1: And I said, give me that.

1298
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:27,371
Speaker 1: I want that.

1299
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:30,525
Speaker 1: And the guy who made it though, he wasn't there.

1300
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:34,300
Speaker 1: He was there, but he wasn't there when I was there.

1301
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:41,097
Speaker 1: So the guy who shared the table with him took the money for, and you know, I took the comic and it was everything I lived up to.

1302
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:46,761
Speaker 1: So if you can find parade with fireworks, uh, oh, the guy's name is not in the front.

1303
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:56,982
Speaker 1: I'm not going to open it now to find out, but parade with fireworks from the image shadow line is totally awesome and everyone should read it, but it's the only way you can get it is to get the two issues.

1304
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,814
Speaker 1: So do whatever you can.

1305
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,908
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to find a comic store to help you out or something.

1306
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,529
Speaker 0: So one thing I ended up picking up and reading pretty quickly at all.

1307
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:07,942
Speaker 0: This was something called Emiko superstar.

1308
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:10,172
Speaker 1: Oh, that's from jinx, which is actually DC.

1309
01:13:10,493 --> 01:13:10,814
Speaker 0: Yes.

1310
01:13:11,316 --> 01:13:12,481
Speaker 0: And, uh, I won.

1311
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:16,826
Speaker 0: This is another thing where I kind of want to actually review it because I'll read it.

1312
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,763
Speaker 0: It w it's by, uh, Mariko Tamaki with, uh, Steve Rolston.

1313
01:13:21,165 --> 01:13:24,102
Speaker 0: And all I want to say is that I read it and it's super, super good.

1314
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:26,476
Speaker 1: I was thinking about pre-ordering it, right?

1315
01:13:26,496 --> 01:13:29,254
Speaker 1: Cause it's, uh, it was on the most recent, you know, pre-order.

1316
01:13:29,274 --> 01:13:30,904
Speaker 1: I think you still have time to pre-order it.

1317
01:13:31,004 --> 01:13:35,549
Speaker 1: actually, if you haven't pre-ordered yet, but I was sort of like, ah, I don't know.

1318
01:13:35,609 --> 01:13:36,072
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1319
01:13:36,153 --> 01:13:39,876
Speaker 1: Cause I was going based on the name, but at the con they were giving it away for free.

1320
01:13:40,157 --> 01:13:40,378
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1321
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:43,642
Speaker 1: So I don't know if what we got for free is the same thing that I would have bought.

1322
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:44,345
Speaker 1: I think it is.

1323
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:45,310
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

1324
01:13:45,632 --> 01:13:49,495
Speaker 0: They were, they, we went up and someone in our party was like, Hey, yeah, it's free.

1325
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:50,059
Speaker 0: We walk over.

1326
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,941
Speaker 0: They're like, no, it's not free, but it turned out it's not free because they ran out.

1327
01:13:54,283 --> 01:13:57,516
Speaker 0: And then she was so nice to just give it to us to read.

1328
01:13:57,536 --> 01:13:58,883
Speaker 1: All right, that's cool.

1329
01:13:58,903 --> 01:14:00,474
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was super, super, super good.

1330
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:01,844
Speaker 0: And I rather enjoyed it.

1331
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:02,931
Speaker 0: I think it has a lot to say.

1332
01:14:03,173 --> 01:14:04,842
Speaker 1: It's the only two other things I got here.

1333
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:09,577
Speaker 1: Right at first, this thing rim look, I'm so about that.

1334
01:14:09,597 --> 01:14:10,481
Speaker 0: All right.

1335
01:14:10,501 --> 01:14:11,104
Speaker 1: So check this out.

1336
01:14:11,164 --> 01:14:11,687
Speaker 1: This is a book.

1337
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:17,273
Speaker 1: we saw just the graphical style of the cover of this book totally sold us.

1338
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:20,285
Speaker 1: It's called fragment and I'm it's by John Lang.

1339
01:14:20,686 --> 01:14:27,618
Speaker 1: And on the cover is like a dude with a hat cover in his face, like a little sort of fedora hat and like a giant coat.

1340
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,334
Speaker 1: And he's obviously some sort of spy dude.

1341
01:14:31,455 --> 01:14:32,680
Speaker 0: We actually did interview the guy.

1342
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:36,348
Speaker 0: I'm not going to play it because it was pretty much, Hey, so what do you make a comic about spies?

1343
01:14:36,368 --> 01:14:37,999
Speaker 0: And he's like, yeah, I like that sort of thing.

1344
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:38,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1345
01:14:38,943 --> 01:14:40,472
Speaker 0: He didn't really say much, but I don't know.

1346
01:14:41,075 --> 01:14:43,050
Speaker 0: I feel like we almost pressured him into doing it.

1347
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,120
Speaker 0: Cause we're like, Hey, you want to interview?

1348
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,268
Speaker 0: He's like, ah, okay.

1349
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:51,769
Speaker 1: Actually the universe that this world takes place in is actually super interesting.

1350
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:56,433
Speaker 1: It's like, you've, there's like technology, but the people can't get their hands on it.

1351
01:14:56,474 --> 01:15:00,775
Speaker 1: So there's like people who are forging for technology and it's pretty cool stuff.

1352
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:03,871
Speaker 1: I would definitely like some sort of role playing game in the fragment world.

1353
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:10,333
Speaker 1: The only other book I got here is the claws come out by Pat Lewis.

1354
01:15:10,454 --> 01:15:14,827
Speaker 1: It is astounding tales of broads and monsters.

1355
01:15:15,489 --> 01:15:16,593
Speaker 0: Hey, this is Pat Lewis.

1356
01:15:17,154 --> 01:15:20,226
Speaker 1: Uh, my book is the claws come out from IDW.

1357
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:26,295
Speaker 1: It is astounding tales of broads and monsters, women and monsters, my two favorite things to draw and to write about.

1358
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:32,323
Speaker 0: So you can get the book in bookstores, Amazon, uh, from my website, lunch break, comics.com.

1359
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:35,613
Speaker 1: It's astounding tales of broads and monsters.

1360
01:15:35,713 --> 01:15:51,068
Speaker 1: I opened it up and I, I, and I was flipping through it and I decided to buy it when I saw a picture of a chained up velociraptor indoors with a girl next to it with her hand on its shoulder, I guess.

1361
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:54,480
Speaker 1: And she says, let's go for a ride junior.

1362
01:15:57,082 --> 01:16:01,054
Speaker 1: If you like broads and monsters, you like broads.

1363
01:16:01,776 --> 01:16:05,709
Speaker 1: And it's a very sort of like slick sort of cartoony style.

1364
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:11,592
Speaker 1: It's sort of, it's not quite penny arcade ish, but it's, it's similar in a way.

1365
01:16:11,612 --> 01:16:13,941
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm definitely all about this comic.

1366
01:16:13,982 --> 01:16:16,833
Speaker 1: Haven't read it yet, but I will read it very, very soon.

1367
01:16:16,854 --> 01:16:19,648
Speaker 1: Uh, and I can tell it's going to be awesome.

1368
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,380
Speaker 1: Oh, let me read the inside of the cover.

1369
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:26,242
Speaker 1: Uh, a teenage girl runs into some unexpected visitors walking home after a date.

1370
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:29,922
Speaker 1: An apathetic scientist works late defrosting the abominable snowman.

1371
01:16:29,942 --> 01:16:37,353
Speaker 1: A naive blood donor dates a rageaholic vampire, a downer like fortune teller inadvertently sparks a zombie epidemic.

1372
01:16:37,977 --> 01:16:39,063
Speaker 1: And it's all played for laughs.

1373
01:16:39,445 --> 01:16:45,237
Speaker 0: Also of all the business cards, because you know, these sorts of things, because we go around kind of half as press half as fans.

1374
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:50,751
Speaker 0: I ended up with a lot of business cards and I usually look at them like a month later, forget who was wanting throw them all away.

1375
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:54,773
Speaker 0: I think of all the business cards I have sprawled out across my desk right now.

1376
01:16:55,256 --> 01:16:57,405
Speaker 0: Pat Lewis has the best one.

1377
01:16:58,107 --> 01:17:02,282
Speaker 0: It's a picture of a, of a businessman lighting his cigar with money.

1378
01:17:02,362 --> 01:17:04,213
Speaker 0: And it's just, the style is so perfect.

1379
01:17:04,273 --> 01:17:08,175
Speaker 1: I don't know the John Lang, the, his business card is pretty freaking cool.

1380
01:17:08,235 --> 01:17:12,457
Speaker 1: Like this girl, this tennis playing girl, he's got on it pretty hot, pretty hot.

1381
01:17:12,678 --> 01:17:14,246
Speaker 0: Actually, I've got both of them in front of me.

1382
01:17:14,326 --> 01:17:14,869
Speaker 0: So yeah.

1383
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:15,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1384
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:23,588
Speaker 0: And he's got like a James bond on the other side, but I guess the last little bit, uh, I swung by the wonder Mark people who were wonderful.

1385
01:17:23,628 --> 01:17:26,039
Speaker 1: I bought the wonder Mark guy.

1386
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:26,662
Speaker 1: What's his name?

1387
01:17:26,682 --> 01:17:27,527
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

1388
01:17:27,548 --> 01:17:28,413
Speaker 1: I keep forgetting.

1389
01:17:28,453 --> 01:17:29,258
Speaker 0: I read wonder Mark.

1390
01:17:29,298 --> 01:17:32,253
Speaker 0: However, I found out about wonder Mark at a previous mocha.

1391
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:33,379
Speaker 1: Oh, Dave Malkey.

1392
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:34,626
Speaker 0: That's it for the longest time.

1393
01:17:34,646 --> 01:17:39,734
Speaker 0: I, before I actually went to the comic, I just assumed the comic was called poop jokes in top hats.

1394
01:17:39,794 --> 01:17:45,075
Speaker 0: No, it's like the comic is, it is poop jokes in top hats, but it is called wonder Mark.

1395
01:17:45,175 --> 01:17:45,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1396
01:17:45,336 --> 01:17:55,161
Speaker 1: I first mocha, we were, we passed by him and we took his little poop jokes and top hats flyer, but I didn't actually start reading it till very, quite a time later.

1397
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:55,503
Speaker 1: Yes.

1398
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,173
Speaker 0: But, uh, he had stop signs.

1399
01:17:58,293 --> 01:18:05,175
Speaker 0: They're just normal stop signs made of metal, but they say poop instead of stop.

1400
01:18:05,476 --> 01:18:06,739
Speaker 0: So of course I bought one.

1401
01:18:06,799 --> 01:18:11,300
Speaker 0: And of course it is at face level in front of the toilet in the downstairs bathroom.

1402
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,971
Speaker 1: You've got to be able to get that off the wall.

1403
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,442
Speaker 0: If we move out, we can get it off the walls.

1404
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:15,106
Speaker 0: It's two way tape.

1405
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:15,710
Speaker 1: It's all you.

1406
01:18:15,931 --> 01:18:16,977
Speaker 0: It's not the no big deal.

1407
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,532
Speaker 0: All I got to say is you got to stop it.

1408
01:18:19,552 --> 01:18:20,900
Speaker 0: You got to poop when that sign is there.

1409
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,353
Speaker 0: And I, and I tried the sign out right when I got home and it worked.

1410
01:18:24,373 --> 01:18:26,962
Speaker 1: Did you stop pooping?

1411
01:18:27,384 --> 01:18:27,906
Speaker 0: I stopped.

1412
01:18:27,986 --> 01:18:28,789
Speaker 0: And then I pooped.

1413
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:38,657
Speaker 0: You see if head, if the sign worked, if there's different ways it could work, if it caused you to stop pooping, then anyone who sees it, it's kind of like an eternal curse.

1414
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:45,472
Speaker 0: But at the same time, if it causes you to stop and then poop, uh, putting it in the bathroom is really the only safe place to put it.

1415
01:18:45,533 --> 01:18:47,343
Speaker 0: Otherwise you might be in the next diarrhea.

1416
01:18:47,363 --> 01:18:50,778
Speaker 1: comics is obviously designed to be put in bathrooms.

1417
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:51,762
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

1418
01:18:52,023 --> 01:18:52,425
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1419
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:55,462
Speaker 0: I feel like I would like to have that sign just on my front door.

1420
01:18:55,482 --> 01:18:58,774
Speaker 0: No, I don't know.

1421
01:18:58,794 --> 01:19:00,319
Speaker 0: Of course you could turn it upside down.

1422
01:19:00,339 --> 01:19:01,141
Speaker 0: Now it says dude.

1423
01:19:02,844 --> 01:19:03,926
Speaker 0: No, it does.

1424
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:06,350
Speaker 1: It smells dude incorrectly.

1425
01:19:06,931 --> 01:19:08,174
Speaker 0: It spells it in leets.

1426
01:19:08,314 --> 01:19:13,706
Speaker 0: It the last mocha.

1427
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:15,274
Speaker 0: I bought what, what is what now?

1428
01:19:15,354 --> 01:19:19,112
Speaker 0: One of my favorite t-shirts, which is a wizard has turned you into a whale.

1429
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:19,996
Speaker 0: Is this awesome?

1430
01:19:20,438 --> 01:19:21,402
Speaker 1: Oh, I bought a t-shirt too.

1431
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:32,763
Speaker 0: I bought pretty much the exact same t-shirt, but instead it shows a picture of a boat and in classic text adventure style, it just says, take boat.

1432
01:19:32,984 --> 01:19:38,831
Speaker 0: It's a giant boat, but I got to tell you, I don't know what it is about these shirts, but they fit my style so well.

1433
01:19:39,052 --> 01:19:39,253
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1434
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:40,538
Speaker 1: I bought a shirt.

1435
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:44,476
Speaker 1: There's a green shirt and a, it was associated with a web comic.

1436
01:19:44,657 --> 01:19:47,128
Speaker 1: I think it was a dumb umbrella web comic, but I'm sorry.

1437
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:57,781
Speaker 1: Um, and the reason I bought the shirt is not because of any relation to the web comic, but because the shirt on its own merits and had a picture of a trilobite, a cartoony, cute trilobite, which, you know, I love them.

1438
01:19:57,801 --> 01:20:07,525
Speaker 1: Trilobites wearing a graduation cap and it said old school is my new favorite shirt.

1439
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:09,697
Speaker 0: I can't believe you didn't buy the teen boat shirt.

1440
01:20:09,717 --> 01:20:12,111
Speaker 0: I didn't buy the team boat shirt.

1441
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:14,845
Speaker 1: I could have bought the team, but I'm waiting for a team boat trade.

1442
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:17,095
Speaker 1: Come on comics, bakery, team boat trade.

1443
01:20:17,698 --> 01:20:18,723
Speaker 0: But, uh, one last thing.

1444
01:20:18,743 --> 01:20:22,884
Speaker 0: Uh, I remember last time we talked about how Indy Stinner had their awesome party.

1445
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:24,291
Speaker 1: We went to it last year.

1446
01:20:24,472 --> 01:20:35,945
Speaker 0: They had it this year and I'm holding the kind of ticket slash invitation in front of me, but it's cool because one, they were there and those guys are awesome, but the party was later than it was last year.

1447
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:38,562
Speaker 0: And we know we had enough and you go to a bunch of other people with us.

1448
01:20:38,582 --> 01:20:41,018
Speaker 0: So we didn't really want to stay in the city super late.

1449
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,592
Speaker 0: And this year the Indy spinner rack party started at 9 PM.

1450
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:45,476
Speaker 1: Oh, too late.

1451
01:20:45,938 --> 01:20:49,362
Speaker 0: So, but the cool thing is the guy walks up to me, he's like, yeah, I don't see Scott around.

1452
01:20:49,865 --> 01:20:55,837
Speaker 0: Uh, you guys probably aren't going to come because it's so late and I know you have to take your train, but, uh, just in case you go.

1453
01:20:55,857 --> 01:20:59,502
Speaker 0: And I was like, yeah, we're probably not going to make it, but, uh, we really want to be there.

1454
01:20:59,803 --> 01:20:59,964
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1455
01:21:00,044 --> 01:21:00,768
Speaker 1: Which guy was it?

1456
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:01,211
Speaker 1: Do you remember?

1457
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,709
Speaker 0: I don't re I don't remember any of their names.

1458
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:12,219
Speaker 0: I'm not going to sit here and be like, well, it was the guy with the face like this, wearing the shirt like this, who talks like this, as opposed to the guy with the face like this and the hair like this.

1459
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:18,520
Speaker 0: I just wish it because I was looking for some of those guys around the time like all the Indy spinner at guys who were there when you weren't around.

1460
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:18,822
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1461
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:20,655
Speaker 0: And they all like scattered when you appeared.

1462
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:20,997
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1463
01:21:21,017 --> 01:21:22,626
Speaker 1: It's like, I didn't, uh, I missed him.

1464
01:21:22,706 --> 01:21:22,927
Speaker 1: All right.

1465
01:21:23,892 --> 01:21:24,294
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

1466
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:25,339
Speaker 1: What else is going down?

1467
01:21:25,419 --> 01:21:25,882
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1468
01:21:25,902 --> 01:21:26,770
Speaker 0: We, I feel like we should end.

1469
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:28,906
Speaker 0: This was kind of a rambling review of Mocha.

1470
01:21:28,946 --> 01:21:29,811
Speaker 1: That's how Mocha is.

1471
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,299
Speaker 1: It's sort of a rambling place.

1472
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,425
Speaker 1: You got all these different things.

1473
01:21:32,506 --> 01:21:33,169
Speaker 0: I got one more thing.

1474
01:21:33,209 --> 01:21:39,519
Speaker 0: I got to review the cookies you can buy and the snack area of Mocha are really good.

1475
01:21:39,599 --> 01:21:40,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all right.

1476
01:21:40,787 --> 01:21:40,948
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1477
01:21:40,988 --> 01:21:45,335
Speaker 1: The thing with Mocha is it really is, you know, going to Mocha feels sort of like this episode feels.

1478
01:21:45,355 --> 01:21:48,115
Speaker 1: There's all these different little things vying for your attention.

1479
01:21:48,135 --> 01:21:51,457
Speaker 1: You're not there for very long, but there's all this awesome concentrated.

1480
01:21:51,477 --> 01:22:04,245
Speaker 0: It's just like awesome, a different, awesome, a different, awesome, a different, very different to decide to walk table by table through anywhere just because the way the crowd is, you'll pretty much wander around and things will catch your eye.

1481
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:13,427
Speaker 0: And kind of like in Mike Dawson's Freddy and me, you'll, your memory of Mocha will be this haze with these bright spots kind of interspersed throughout.

1482
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:14,190
Speaker 1: Yep.

1483
01:22:14,913 --> 01:22:16,139
Speaker 1: And Mocha is totally awesome.

1484
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:17,407
Speaker 1: It's fun to go every year.

1485
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:18,756
Speaker 1: It was just as fun this year.

1486
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:20,245
Speaker 1: In fact, I think it was the best one yet.

1487
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:22,798
Speaker 1: I'll be going back next year for sure.

1488
01:22:22,858 --> 01:22:23,823
Speaker 0: Almost definitely.

1489
01:22:23,843 --> 01:22:26,233
Speaker 1: A hundred percent buying more awesome comics.

1490
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:33,564
Speaker 1: And, uh, maybe we helped you find out about some not so mainstream comics that actually might be hard for you to get.

1491
01:22:33,684 --> 01:22:34,046
Speaker 1: Sorry.

1492
01:22:35,913 --> 01:22:44,029
Speaker 0: And I guess we'll end it on the interviews that I grabbed that were worth listening to that I didn't bother thinking of a better place to put.

1493
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:45,214
Speaker 0: So here they all are.

1494
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:50,174
Speaker 0: So we're here with Hillary Tisman from Pantheon graphic novels.

1495
01:22:51,057 --> 01:23:06,450
Speaker 0: And we're really excited about My Brain is Hanging Upside Down by David Heatley, which is this kind of graphic memoir all about everything you wanted to know about him and even some stuff you might not have, but it's still totally quirky and really interesting.

1496
01:23:06,932 --> 01:23:11,874
Speaker 0: And Bat manga, which is the secret history of Batman in Japan, complete with toys.

1497
01:23:12,014 --> 01:23:14,063
Speaker 0: So both out in October, check them out.

1498
01:23:15,068 --> 01:23:17,058
Speaker 0: So you're at the Mocha Festival here.

1499
01:23:17,098 --> 01:23:17,782
Speaker 0: How are things going?

1500
01:23:17,943 --> 01:23:19,070
Speaker 0: What's the vibe of the crowd?

1501
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:19,452
Speaker 0: How is it?

1502
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:21,485
Speaker 0: You know, they all seem really excited.

1503
01:23:21,505 --> 01:23:26,259
Speaker 1: They keep telling us they already own our books, which I guess is a good thing, but, you know, we want them to buy a little more.

1504
01:23:27,182 --> 01:23:28,975
Speaker 1: So, so far, so good.

1505
01:23:29,036 --> 01:23:29,580
Speaker 1: No complaints.

1506
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:32,125
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1507
01:23:32,185 --> 01:23:32,346
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1508
01:23:32,366 --> 01:23:37,649
Speaker 1: I'm doing a book for DC Vertigo that I think is going to be released in spring of '09.

1509
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:41,162
Speaker 1: Bob Shrek's my editor and it's called The Nobody.

1510
01:23:41,885 --> 01:23:45,362
Speaker 0: And it's sort of a loose play on the invisible man character from the H.G.

1511
01:23:45,382 --> 01:23:52,557
Speaker 1: Wells novel, but I kind of have him sort of hiding out in one of my little rural communities and interacting with townsfolk.

1512
01:23:52,657 --> 01:23:53,819
Speaker 3: So that's kind of what it's about.

1513
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:55,422
Speaker 3: All right.

1514
01:23:55,443 --> 01:23:56,547
Speaker 3: My name's Tom Motley.

1515
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:59,397
Speaker 3: I do cartoon and illustration.

1516
01:23:59,839 --> 01:24:02,293
Speaker 3: My book here today is called Twilight of the Bums.

1517
01:24:02,374 --> 01:24:09,906
Speaker 3: It's written by Raymond Fetterman and George Chambers, who are a couple of avant-garde novelists who emerged in the sixties.

1518
01:24:09,926 --> 01:24:15,894
Speaker 3: And they did this jam story of microfictions about two old bums, which stand for the two of them.

1519
01:24:15,914 --> 01:24:17,823
Speaker 3: They share a shadow in common.

1520
01:24:17,864 --> 01:24:24,094
Speaker 3: I drew some illustrations in the margins and the shadow represents me, the silent voice and the thing.

1521
01:24:24,134 --> 01:24:30,580
Speaker 3: So there's cartoons in the margins of every page, and it's a very nice book from Start Your Own Books.

1522
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:35,360
Speaker 3: I hope you'll all check it out, www.startyourown.com.

1523
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,018
Speaker 3: My other book is the new issue of my series, True Fiction.

1524
01:24:39,058 --> 01:24:45,868
Speaker 3: I've got True Fiction number seven, subtitled Ink Mathematics, and it has a lot of my experimental work over the years.

1525
01:24:46,511 --> 01:24:51,351
Speaker 3: I work with the group UBAPO America and other related experiments.

1526
01:24:51,411 --> 01:24:54,724
Speaker 3: It's all structural, formula stuff, but don't be put off by it.

1527
01:24:54,765 --> 01:24:55,347
Speaker 3: It's funny.

1528
01:24:55,547 --> 01:25:00,886
Speaker 3: It's all whimsical and silly, and I hope someone will check it out.
