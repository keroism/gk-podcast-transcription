Speaker 0: But I don't give a fuck every time I don't get.

39
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:29,860
Speaker 0: it's almost like the more beloved someone is the more satisfying is to see them go down hard.

65
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:37,755
Speaker 0: right, so this is dude And his name is CV Cevalski, and we may have talked about him in the early days of geek nights because it was around that time 2005 2006 ish that I was aware of this individual because I was buying comics.

66
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:43,242
Speaker 0: and CV Cevalski is a dude who's like Some.

68
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:46,875
Speaker 0: He's like a white dude from Connecticut.

69
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, he works.

70
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,351
Speaker 0: You know he works for Marvel Comics.

71
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:56,740
Speaker 0: I enjoy comics Basically the same person basically no, but he's a madweeb right?

72
00:04:57,443 --> 00:05:00,415
Speaker 0: He wasn't one of those people that was like you know like like.

73
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:07,477
Speaker 0: I would hear him talk on podcasts or see like the comics that he was writing or reading or whatnot.

74
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:22,180
Speaker 0: and it's like Oh this person is actually a weeb who has legit knowledge about manga and such and isn't just like you know Someone who only likes Naruto or whatever or is pretending to like manga in order to promote it, right?

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,378
Speaker 0: You know you see those people were like faking it and those people were like actually legit, right?

76
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:37,119
Speaker 0: So he's basically a weeb that worked at Marvel Comics and actually his jobs were at Marvel were often related to his You know manga knowledges and such.

77
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:43,999
Speaker 1: And now that So the news is you may know him by a different name and not realize it.

78
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:58,440
Speaker 0: well Oh, so the the first news is that the he is now Editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics, which if you don't know is the number one creative job You can have at Marvel or DC is to be editor-in-chief.

79
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:01,875
Speaker 0: I guess same thing at Shonen jump or any comics publishing place.

80
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:05,369
Speaker 0: right if you're the editor-in-chief You're the number one creative person.

81
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,980
Speaker 0: you're like the person who has to talk at the conventions.

82
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:13,200
Speaker 0: It's like anyone above you only cares about money or is like a Disney exec or something, right?

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,706
Speaker 0: You're in charge of the comics.

84
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:15,711
Speaker 0: if it's in the comics.

85
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:17,740
Speaker 0: It's your responsibility, right?

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,468
Speaker 0: All the other editors writers artists are all under you.

87
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,415
Speaker 0: It's the big job, right?

88
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:29,568
Speaker 0: You finally after so many years I mean he's been there since at least 2005 when I just you know pride before then Worked his way up to that job.

89
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:39,800
Speaker 1: now you'd think if he's a weeb Then he would be able to push toward Fixing some of the most egregious problems that are specific to floppy Marvel comics.

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,302
Speaker 0: I know he.

91
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:51,042
Speaker 0: there is actually some chance that he's gonna you know, do some good things that a you know Weeb manga type loving people like us who will appreciate like he you know He could.

92
00:06:51,323 --> 00:07:01,113
Speaker 0: you know, it's more likely that he will push Marvel Comics in a direction that we appreciate Than any previous editor which is why this is all such a shame.

93
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:06,270
Speaker 0: such a shame that way back in the day Well, not too far back but backing up the

94
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,800
Speaker 1: 2000s, which actually is a terrifyingly long time ago I

95
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:14,694
Speaker 0: actually remember this and when it was brought up again I like I have this vague memory and now that the truth is out.

96
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:15,759
Speaker 0: It's so clear, right?

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:26,220
Speaker 0: There was a time when there was like Marvel manga verse and like some other Marvel comics that had like hints of you know, manga ness in them, right?

98
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:30,974
Speaker 0: And I remember seeing some comics around that actually seemed it like.

99
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:46,167
Speaker 0: it was a time where they were like getting Japanese creators to work on Marvel Comics, right and it was like ooh, and I remember seeing Plenty of you know, Japanese names on Marvel Comics Which came out of nowhere?

100
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:48,176
Speaker 0: It was like suddenly they you know, they're like, oh man.

101
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:49,744
Speaker 0: Manga is the hot thing I guess you know.

102
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,940
Speaker 0: and that was the time when you know media play was not yet dead, right?

103
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,559
Speaker 0: And there's you know, manga was the boom was happening.

104
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:04,220
Speaker 0: So Marvel is jumping on that bandwagon a little bit and I remember seeing some names there that were not.

105
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:09,280
Speaker 0: You know the names of known creators almost like perhaps Akira Yoshida, right?

106
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:19,016
Speaker 0: so apparently Akira Yoshida is actually The current editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics CB Smolski fat white guy from Connecticut.

107
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:37,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Uh Yeah, so on the one hand right people got to understand using a fake name to create things is in general a thing that has always happened for a very very long time and is acceptable in the right Circumstances.

108
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:37,684
Speaker 0: Yep.

109
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:39,592
Speaker 1: There are a lot of reasons someone might do that.

110
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:47,040
Speaker 1: They might be writing say smut I need to separate it from their non-smut persona in case they want to get certain kinds of work down the road.

111
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:57,397
Speaker 0: They might be actually, you know writing for some other author like you're writing a book but actually it's all gonna be published under like this one author's name and you're getting paid like a lot

112
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,943
Speaker 1: of those pulp books that You might really

113
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:02,580
Speaker 0: go to the grocery store and there's like a thousand spy novels all by the same name.

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,819
Speaker 0: It's like no no, no, those are by like 20 different people.

115
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:06,807
Speaker 1: It sucks and it's sad.

116
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:14,447
Speaker 1: but a lot of people who are not white dudes will often use a. That makes them seem like a white dude.

117
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:23,520
Speaker 0: to avoid that basic latent racism in the consumption of media in the u.s Right, like if you you know, you're gonna send your your pitch to a whole bunch of publishers and they racist.

118
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:30,512
Speaker 0: but they're like And your name is you know, very foreign to the United States.

119
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,280
Speaker 0: they might look it over or be prejudiced towards it.

120
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:38,680
Speaker 0: So you said you change your name to some much more spellable and pronounceable name.

121
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:50,156
Speaker 1: Do is make up a fake name of a minority when you're a white dude And then use that to gain some sort of advantage in your work.

122
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:56,815
Speaker 0: Yeah You're trying to basically gain some sort of like cultural credibility.

123
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:06,000
Speaker 0: right that you don't got Yep, and that is not okay, and he done dude that yep, and I guess he only did it for a year.

124
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:09,420
Speaker 1: But it doesn't seem like he really apologized in depth.

125
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,884
Speaker 0: I don't think he understands like.

126
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,971
Speaker 0: he doesn't know what he did like he.

127
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:13,613
Speaker 0: it's sort of like.

128
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:18,476
Speaker 0: he knows that it was bad But he doesn't understand how bad right?

129
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:23,173
Speaker 1: I was young and I even had a lot to learn back then.

130
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,379
Speaker 1: it wasn't that long ago.

131
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,768
Speaker 0: See, here's the one thing people gotta understand.

132
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:36,806
Speaker 0: is actually someone made an app that will help you Apologize at least specifically for sexual harassment and assault but in general Right when you apologize.

133
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:40,657
Speaker 0: first of all I got to talk about people who apologize who don't need to apologize.

134
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:44,995
Speaker 0: people like say They're sorry when they didn't do nothing like you know don't do that right.

135
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:45,638
Speaker 0: do not do that.

136
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,646
Speaker 0: only Apologize if you actually hurt someone.

137
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:53,372
Speaker 1: and if you did hurt someone well only apologize if you did something wrong Not just if you hurt someone right.

138
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:54,015
Speaker 1: punch a Nazi.

139
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:54,820
Speaker 1: I'm not apologizing.

140
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:02,044
Speaker 0: well, no you apologies are for when you hurt someone you didn't mean to hurt someone and You regret hurting them.

141
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:09,872
Speaker 0: you wish you had not done that and you need to make sure and you're letting people know this right and What you got to do to make a quality apology?

142
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:11,079
Speaker 0: It's real simple number one.

143
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:13,790
Speaker 0: Do not make any excuses in your apology.

144
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you make an excuse you're not apologizing Right.

145
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,768
Speaker 1: you're passing the buck right.

146
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,333
Speaker 0: you must make no excuse.

147
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,420
Speaker 0: the saying you're young and night nut that's an excuse.

148
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:23,646
Speaker 0: You cannot make an excuse.

149
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,657
Speaker 0: you just got to say I was bad.

150
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:38,956
Speaker 0: I didn't do it Yep, and number two you got to try to fix it in whatever way you can and obviously you'll never hundred-percent fix anything because time Only goes in one direction, but you just got to do your best and people still might not forgive you.

151
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:42,187
Speaker 0: That's okay Because you've done a bad thing.

152
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,491
Speaker 0: They don't got to forgive you for shit.

153
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:43,953
Speaker 1: Well.

154
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:45,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a. there's a very fine point there.

155
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,720
Speaker 1: That's just because someone apologizes does not mean that the aggrieved party is under any album.

156
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,314
Speaker 0: I'm sorry that like I murdered your whole family.

157
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,659
Speaker 0: I hope you can forgive me.

158
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,007
Speaker 0: I didn't make any excuses.

159
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,192
Speaker 0: I'll try to make amends.

160
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:05,853
Speaker 0: I will you know Try to fight crimes and also give you money, and you're gonna turn into Batman.

161
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:10,808
Speaker 0: I'll do things to make up for my heinous ways and That doesn't mean you have to forgive me.

162
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:11,975
Speaker 0: I fucking murdered your family.

163
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:15,473
Speaker 1: Yep, right That's how we got the budget where we could undo that.

164
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:16,580
Speaker 1: That's a whole different ballgame.

165
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,818
Speaker 0: Oh, we just I mean if we could undo murdering the murdering wouldn't be wrong would it?

166
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:24,217
Speaker 1: no Of course it seems like in free market it ends up being what anyway what it?

167
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:27,832
Speaker 1: yeah You didn't read the culture book that gets into that actually.

168
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:33,732
Speaker 0: yeah, all right, but the point is Apologize properly also your editor-in-chief of Marvel.

00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:49,038
Speaker 0: now people are gonna be yeah If you're about to get promoted to a job of visibility And you have any sort of skeleton in the closet I would suggest either How big or small I'm to either get the skeleton out of there, or don't get promoted.

Speaker 1: if you're evil If you go to the moon if you are confident you can hide that skeleton Forever.

177
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:02,828
Speaker 0: you can't hide the skeleton.

178
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:03,631
Speaker 0: the internet exists.

181
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,960
Speaker 1: for me the age of the skeleton has come I mean to share.

182
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:28,844
Speaker 1: So in other news that's at least a little bit less Depressing.

Speaker 0: It's like the premiere animation.

191
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:00,300
Speaker 0: it might be like the biggest animation studio in Europe.

192
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,939
Speaker 0: They're like I even know over outside of US or Japan or Canada where else you know.

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,379
Speaker 0: I was like I don't know a big animation studios from other places.

194
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,631
Speaker 1: They make good stuff and most people if they know about them.

195
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:11,440
Speaker 1: They know about Tom Moore specifically.

196
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,691
Speaker 0: Tom Moore directed wrote that movie right.

197
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:25,292
Speaker 0: he was like the creative drive behind that and then Due to the success of secretive cows which is like a labor of love that probably didn't make a lot of money They made song and a sea which song is basically a perfect movie like.

198
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:28,640
Speaker 1: I literally can't really fault any aspect of it.

199
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,800
Speaker 1: It's one of my favorite movies.

200
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:34,716
Speaker 0: That was also Tom Moore and whatever but cartoon saloon, then it's like well.

201
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:35,739
Speaker 0: What are they done since then?

202
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:35,960
Speaker 0: well?

203
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:43,799
Speaker 0: They are working on that wolf movie on a wolf movie the wolf walkers Which is used to see the trailer, and you already know that they made it.

204
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,010
Speaker 0: It's probably gonna be oh my god.

205
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,392
Speaker 0: It is a 100%.

206
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:46,854
Speaker 1: just go see it.

207
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,370
Speaker 1: Don't even don't.

208
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:50,460
Speaker 1: we don't even need to review it.

209
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,860
Speaker 0: Just go talk about it before or after because you're gonna see that anyway.

210
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,548
Speaker 0: But you know make a little money on the side.

211
00:14:56,609 --> 00:15:01,623
Speaker 0: It's just a little collaboration work with a couple other Studios here now.

212
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,227
Speaker 1: This was just Purdue.

213
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:09,468
Speaker 1: Tom Moore was one of the producers, but this is directed by Nora Twomey mm-hmm I don't know.

214
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:09,931
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

215
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:13,700
Speaker 0: I don't know how to pronounce your name Nora Yep, I also do not know but the breadwinner.

216
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:20,779
Speaker 1: We saw it in the theater And I don't really want to give a full review to it primarily because you should just go see it.

217
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:26,146
Speaker 1: Like most of what we might say is Moot because you're just gonna go see it.

218
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:34,199
Speaker 1: however you need to see it because one is beautiful - it is deeply Touching and it will make you cry.

219
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:40,925
Speaker 1: And Three it's a movie that needed to be made and needs to be seen because a lot of people Despite the fact that the u.s.

220
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:45,440
Speaker 1: Invaded Afghanistan and tore down the Taliban and like left this chaotic realm behind.

221
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:49,424
Speaker 1: It's about the people of Afghanistan And it's beautiful.

222
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:57,049
Speaker 0: so the story of this movie is that you have this you know family living in Afghanistan And they don't got a lot of monies But you know their

223
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:06,469
Speaker 1: host rise of the Taliban But not out of like the people who like the older people in the movie were in Afghanistan before the rise of the Taliban

224
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,177
Speaker 0: before you know Russia and before yeah, right.

225
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:16,060
Speaker 0: so anyway You know their life isn't great, but you know they're a family, but you know Muslims.

226
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:28,052
Speaker 0: You know especially this very strict You know I guess only the very strict Taliban type ones who are you know even more sexist than any sexism You're gonna find in the United States right?

227
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:28,554
Speaker 0: you know women.

228
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,880
Speaker 0: women can't go out in public.

229
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:30,744
Speaker 0: There are.

230
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:34,040
Speaker 1: there are communities like that that are Christian in the United States.

231
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,448
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are some of those weird towns upstate.

232
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:40,040
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm just talking about you know average United States, right?

233
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,880
Speaker 0: You're not gonna find that on New York City Street, right?

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the point is that even the Hasidic Jews who are real bad in this regard are not that bad?

235
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,967
Speaker 0: Oh, there's slightly less under the Taliban still way bad.

236
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:54,700
Speaker 1: something very specific was that women were basically not allowed to do anything on escorted.

237
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, you basically can't go outside.

238
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:03,307
Speaker 0: You're supposed to stay in the house and be owned by your husband or brother or father or closest male relative And that's that's your life.

239
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:12,496
Speaker 1: and something happens to this family and this young girl Has to dress as a boy to be able to do simple things like go out and buy food for her family.

240
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:14,643
Speaker 1: mm-hmm and It goes on.

241
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:15,646
Speaker 1: so I she's the breadwinner.

242
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:30,120
Speaker 1: and what it's really about is the sort of The resilience and storytelling in history of the Afghani people who have dealt with regime after regime and What proxy wars the Cold War though throughout all this history?

243
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:38,000
Speaker 1: It's sort of the story of how those people have continued to survive and make do and how there are both Like there are good and bad people in all these situations.

244
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:42,500
Speaker 1: And I don't really want to say any more because seriously you should go see this movie.

245
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:46,274
Speaker 1: It's fantastic, and it is currently still in theaters.

246
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:50,447
Speaker 0: if you live in a real city It's not gonna be in every movie theater.

247
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:55,200
Speaker 0: It's but you know if you live near a populated area It will be in the artsy theater.

248
00:17:55,521 --> 00:18:00,900
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is if you can't be for some reason you live in a boonies place or another country or somewhere where you?

249
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,986
Speaker 0: Can't see this easily.

250
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:11,020
Speaker 0: It will probably be streaming Downloading you know within a year within six months even maybe who knows right the secret of Kells end song of the sea.

251
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,704
Speaker 0: you Can both like.

252
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:19,599
Speaker 0: I think now they were on Netflix for a time But I think now if you want to see them legally you got a pan Amazon Yep, but you know I think they're like five ten bucks something like that.

253
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,787
Speaker 1: What was interesting though is when we went to see it.

254
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:37,660
Speaker 1: usually when we see a movie like a cartoon saloon movie like song of The sea or like any anime movie in New York It's like the same set of weebs show up every time like I don't know any of those people, but I see him Every time I see one of those movies in the theater.

255
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll always be like we went to the showing of ghost in the shell arise.

256
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,900
Speaker 0: Oh look who's here.

257
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,755
Speaker 0: Oh, we go to the showing of Satoshi kano.

258
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:45,740
Speaker 0: look who's here.

259
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,745
Speaker 0: It's the same weebs again.

260
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, the New York weebs would go to anytime something is screened.

261
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:56,080
Speaker 1: It was fascinating that I did not see those weebs in the theater for this, but the theater was still full.

262
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,500
Speaker 0: Well usually when you go to we usually go like children's film festival screenings.

263
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:02,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are usually full of like a whole bunch of families of kids and stuff.

264
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:06,461
Speaker 1: Right, but if you go to like a Ghibli that isn't part of that or like any edge It's just.

265
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,105
Speaker 1: it's just leaves all the way down.

266
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:09,610
Speaker 1: mm-hmm not weebs.

267
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:15,059
Speaker 1: the weebs did not seem to be the primary draw for this movie No, even though the weebs should probably all see it.

268
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,687
Speaker 1: So yeah, go see this movie.

269
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,540
Speaker 0: all the human beings should go see it probably.

270
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:25,126
Speaker 1: So in some other news that I don't go too deep into Anime NYC as you know happened.

271
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,517
Speaker 1: It was the sort of first new anime convention.

272
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,640
Speaker 1: That's real in New York City.

273
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:40,776
Speaker 0: We would have been there if not for packs unplugged yep, and it seems at least judging by social media people I know who went there and other things it seems to have been worth a subway ride to go to.

274
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:46,259
Speaker 0: so if it does not Collide with anything next next year I will probably go to it.

275
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:46,440
Speaker 0: yep.

276
00:19:46,640 --> 00:20:09,159
Speaker 1: So I think at this point unless this reliably overlaps with packs unplugged every year Which hopefully will not then I think anime NYC is going to become the sole anime convention that we perform at Because I can take the subway to it and as much as I love anime Boston because it's a fantastic anime convention It's just too much of a pain, and there's too many packs as we have to deal with now.

277
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:18,523
Speaker 0: Oh By the way the next anime season is gonna begin in like early mid January so that means we got to do our Judging.

278
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,530
Speaker 0: it's maybe late December when I'm not working.

279
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:23,120
Speaker 1: we have to do another judge anime by its cover.

280
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,274
Speaker 0: We're gonna do it for reals cuz I'm excited.

281
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:26,180
Speaker 1: I'm they're going well.

282
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,344
Speaker 1: I'm really happy with our judge.

283
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,111
Speaker 0: everybody's cover one is going well.

284
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:32,023
Speaker 1: well if you take account the ones we did at old anime Boston.

285
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:32,808
Speaker 1: yeah, we videoed.

286
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,077
Speaker 0: yeah, we're gonna keep it up though.

287
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:42,506
Speaker 1: Yeah but anyway things Of the day.

288
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:49,560
Speaker 1: so many of you listening to a Wednesday geek nights are probably Creative in some way like you try to make games or you make art or something.

289
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:59,760
Speaker 1: But I noticed there are a lot of people if you're not you should be who like make some art and make some games but then they see Professional stuff like triple-a stuff, and they feel inadequate.

290
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:05,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it that was made by a whole team of people who had a zillion dollars and worked for a very long time.

291
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,908
Speaker 0: So I cannot compete with that.

292
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:12,063
Speaker 0: the fact that you can even come close to that with some Adobe shit in your apartment Is a miracle.

293
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:16,420
Speaker 1: so this video is a full panel like an hour-long panel from a convention.

294
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:22,422
Speaker 1: But what it is is the basically creative directors of overwatch taking you

295
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,785
Speaker 0: through course your favorite how

296
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:39,740
Speaker 1: they made overwatch, but they show a lot of the early art and the early gameplay and You should see what overwatch looked like for more than a year of an entire team working on it.

297
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,840
Speaker 1: And then you will feel a lot better about how much progress you're making with your own art.

298
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:53,438
Speaker 1: Holy shit was it just like t-pose stick figures shooting garbage at each other Without animations for a long time?

299
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,448
Speaker 0: yep It's already got so everyone at least ever.

300
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:02,585
Speaker 0: a lot of nerds know all nerds should know that in Disney World land I don't know which one both.

301
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:08,670
Speaker 0: Maybe there's like a secret restaurant that only like you know Special people get to go to.

302
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,260
Speaker 0: it's like this something club.

303
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like where Walt Disney would eat right one of those velvet ropes if pretty much any Culture.

304
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:20,994
Speaker 0: and the thing about velvet ropes is that you know having a secret club.

305
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:26,430
Speaker 0: if you actually want to do something secret No one knows about it because it's actually a fucking secret club.

306
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:35,720
Speaker 0: right, but if you've got what usually when there's a club That's you know fancy for rich people only like they want a status symbol that they must use a velvet rope.

307
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,302
Speaker 0: That's a let.

308
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:38,128
Speaker 0: You know it's there to let you know.

309
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:42,723
Speaker 0: you can't come in to make themselves feel better about keeping you out Right.

310
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:48,579
Speaker 0: yeah, it's no good for me to you know have a secret club right if I want to You know rub my ego.

311
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:52,820
Speaker 0: I got to put a velvet rope and have a bouncer at the door who doesn't let in schmucks.

312
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:53,384
Speaker 0: Why?

313
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:55,520
Speaker 0: why do they have the schmucks out there in the first place?

314
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,694
Speaker 0: Why don't they let them in so that the people inside feel better about themselves and feel cool?

315
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:01,099
Speaker 1: should we make a velvet rope at?

316
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,615
Speaker 0: Arkhan yes, yes, we should.

317
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,227
Speaker 1: if you pay Some people just give a special.

318
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:09,460
Speaker 0: anyone who's not I'll just anyone who's not that guy can come through the velvet rope.

319
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:16,859
Speaker 0: That's an inverse velvet rope the velvet ropes at the front door anyway however.

320
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,900
Speaker 0: So yeah everyone knows about this Disney World restaurant.

321
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,193
Speaker 0: I forget the name of but anyway, I learned today that in Japan.

322
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:28,706
Speaker 0: There is a secret Nintendo bar Called 84 right.

323
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:30,920
Speaker 0: so it's actually not that secret.

324
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,907
Speaker 0: It's just in a hidden place, and it's not advertised.

325
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:59,254
Speaker 0: and the way to get in is basically have someone who already can already a member Brings you there and then you keep you go enough and that you prove that you're not some fanboy who like screams and goes nuts when you see other cool people and You go enough times And you know you taught you have a conversation with the owner and some other another member and they decide yeah This person's chill, and then you're now a member and you can now bring new people and so forth.

326
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,880
Speaker 0: so it's not super secret.

327
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:07,444
Speaker 0: But it's secret enough that like people don't stumble into it randomly because like it's probably not on the street It's in like a location.

328
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,250
Speaker 0: You could only go to if you knew where to go.

329
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:23,127
Speaker 0: and the people who go there are you know a lot of Nintendo employees or Pro wrestlers or mangaka or other somewhat famous people Are the frequenters of this establishment.

330
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:30,011
Speaker 0: so and what we have here is we have an article that a let me know this place Exists even though I'll never go there my whole life.

331
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,720
Speaker 1: two tons of photos of the inside.

332
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:36,303
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool Yeah, and the photos the inside show all the awesome stuff They have there.

333
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:38,131
Speaker 0: because you know the place.

334
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:40,160
Speaker 0: we should carry me a moto goes to get a drink.

335
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,838
Speaker 0: It's probably gonna have some cool shit, and it sure does.

336
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:48,197
Speaker 0: yeah It makes you want to open up a secret place, but I don't know how to do that.

337
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:48,860
Speaker 1: look at that.

338
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,502
Speaker 1: We gotta have money.

339
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:51,049
Speaker 1: someone's gonna have money.

340
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:51,852
Speaker 0: I don't have money.

341
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have money.

342
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:55,427
Speaker 0: one of that money Money to open a place.

343
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,280
Speaker 1: so in the matter moment the booklet book was the fifth season.

344
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,979
Speaker 1: You should read it cuz we did our episode on it.

345
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:04,783
Speaker 1: I'm gonna pick my new book real soon after I finish a bunch of other stuff I'm working on.

346
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:12,920
Speaker 1: we have a lull where we're doing real geek nights episodes until January And then we got to go to PAX South.

347
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:14,186
Speaker 1: I feel like we just had.

348
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,533
Speaker 0: we're going to magfest first.

349
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,839
Speaker 1: We did just have a pax.

350
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:18,987
Speaker 1: We have so many paxes.

351
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:20,994
Speaker 1: I'm literally losing track of them.

352
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:22,920
Speaker 1: It's it's starting to be a problem.

353
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:29,935
Speaker 1: I had to like make a spreadsheet to keep track of which paxes I have like sent our panels to or bought a hotel for?

354
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:31,160
Speaker 0: did your enforcer paperwork?

355
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:33,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz now I had a lot of enforcer paperwork now.

356
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:37,600
Speaker 1: I'm employed in like multiple states, and it's a pain in the ass to be honest.

357
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:47,727
Speaker 1: Yeah So we will be at both magfest doing a ton of panels and playing a ton of games and at PAX South we're on Friday January 12th at 4 p.m.. In the Bobcat theater.

358
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:52,540
Speaker 1: We're doing a brand new geek nights panel talking to me balancing games.

359
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:56,635
Speaker 1: So we're gonna talk about like half done how to stand on a seesaw.

360
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:57,760
Speaker 0: Maybe a little less than half done.

361
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think it'll be a good panel.

362
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,311
Speaker 1: I'm feeling good about it.

363
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:20,917
Speaker 1: I got a. it feels like the kind of panels we did like a decade ago where We have a looser structure to the slides and a lot more anecdotes and a lot more give-and-take instead of the like hyper-structured ones we did for a while recently where we have like 70 slides and like a very strict order of what we talked about

364
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:21,520
Speaker 0: anyway.

365
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:26,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you should go onto the internet and find us in all the places.

366
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:30,443
Speaker 0: go to YouTube go to my youtube go to rims YouTube Instagram.

367
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,520
Speaker 0: we got a geek nights Instagram like what I've been trying to do is anytime.

368
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:42,398
Speaker 0: There's like we do a thing as geek nights like go to a convention or about whatever I try to like take a photo put it on the Instagram and people seem to like that.

369
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:42,840
Speaker 0: I don't know.

370
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, what is that like something?

371
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,228
Speaker 0: I don't understand.

372
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:53,500
Speaker 0: is general phenomenon is like you know you post up on Twitter Whatever what you know once in every little day or two that you know and people care a little bit.

373
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:57,078
Speaker 0: But if you post like a selfie like you get likes like everybody.

374
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:59,126
Speaker 0: yep It's like why I don't?

375
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,089
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

376
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,655
Speaker 0: my like pattern doesn't follow that.

377
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:07,225
Speaker 0: I like things that are like oh If some post a selfie, I don't necessarily Automate auto like it.

378
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:15,540
Speaker 1: I like a lot more things and the reasons I do are actually a surprisingly complex heuristic when I try to think about how to explain what I like and what I don't like.

379
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:20,394
Speaker 1: Well what I click the like button on versus what I do not click the like.

380
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:23,412
Speaker 0: well basically for the rest of December I don't have a lot to do.

381
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:30,980
Speaker 0: so I'm doing a lot more in the streaming and possibly you know shorter video photo making department.

382
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,612
Speaker 1: I was thinking which did you bring the SD card for the panel?

383
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:35,380
Speaker 0: I think so these in my bag somewhere.

384
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:43,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, well tiny it's hard easy to lose those things because we did at packs unplugged The kind of event that we've done like three or four times ever.

385
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,491
Speaker 1: We did him at like packs prime and packs East and East.

386
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,780
Speaker 1: we did him in this normal sized room and a prime.

387
00:27:49,262 --> 00:27:50,165
Speaker 1: We did him in a room.

388
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:52,374
Speaker 1: That's about the size of this geek night's room right here.

389
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:59,189
Speaker 1: It was a tiny room that's hidden that no one knew about and For the first time we actually videoed that kind of event.

390
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:11,560
Speaker 1: so it'll be interesting to have video of that kind of like Weird event that people could only experience if they went to a packs and knew about the weird event We were doing and we're gonna try to put that on YouTube which will be interesting.

391
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,413
Speaker 1: Gotta figure out how to edit together all the b-roll we got and everything.

392
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:19,460
Speaker 1: But anyway, uh Other than that right ahead of Wikipedia open up celeriac.

393
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:21,992
Speaker 1: Guess let's talk about this manga.

394
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:26,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think it was last time we animate Boston.

395
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:28,939
Speaker 0: We did the judge anime by its cover.

396
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:35,301
Speaker 0: One of the anime was about rock who go and that's all we knew about it at the time because you were judging it by The cover.

397
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:41,180
Speaker 1: now if you do not know rock ago is a traditional form of I'd say Japanese stand-up comedy.

398
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,058
Speaker 1: But they don't stand up and sit down sit down comedy.

399
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,428
Speaker 0: Yep But it's not as you always comedy.

400
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:48,636
Speaker 0: It's it's storytelling but usually comedy.

401
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:54,292
Speaker 1: It's a sort of Ritualized and formalized form of storytelling that has its own tropes.

402
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's own its own memes effectively, right?

403
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,180
Speaker 0: We basically we found out at least I found out about it.

404
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:10,269
Speaker 0: We went to Otakon one year and they had this guy come who was like a professional rock ago performer But he did it in English in English Which not too many people in the world do like.

405
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,875
Speaker 0: maybe was he the only one.

406
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,040
Speaker 0: if not, there's not many.

407
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,826
Speaker 0: I think we were single digits.

408
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:19,000
Speaker 1: Emily and I were actually looking for more of it because we rock ago.

409
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,880
Speaker 0: Okay, was I was we were our friend invited us one-to-one recently, but it was not a good time.

410
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,712
Speaker 1: Let's just say that there is not a lot of rock ago.

411
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:33,760
Speaker 0: That is not in Japanese But if you speak Japanese, you can go to Japan and just like watch rock ago all fucking day real cheap.

412
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,796
Speaker 1: Yep, in fact, I learned about that from the last two pages of this manga.

413
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:46,472
Speaker 0: Anyway But anyway, so but that one time that I saw rock ago in person It was fucking hilarious and hysterical and oh my god is amazing.

414
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:47,776
Speaker 0: It was really impressive.

415
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:50,260
Speaker 1: like this manga We're gonna talk about there's a thing.

416
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:56,730
Speaker 0: It's like a person sits there on a little cushion and you look all day All they have is like a fan and like another thing.

417
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:57,473
Speaker 0: What's the other thing?

418
00:29:57,493 --> 00:30:05,600
Speaker 0: They have seems like there's a few things They could have I don't know Like a few objects that they use to help tell the story, but you know, the fan is the primary one.

419
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:15,020
Speaker 0: But they don't stand up they just sit there and just using facial expressions a variety of voices, you know gestures They like bring that a whole story to life.

420
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:19,960
Speaker 0: It's it's really, you know, like an excellent acting and storytelling the skills.

421
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,260
Speaker 0: It's almost like a puppet show where just your body is the puppet and your voice.

422
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, what I would say is that in the well a puppet show also uses the best right.

423
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:30,300
Speaker 0: not always I'd say not always.

424
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:37,529
Speaker 0: I'm just saying there's a lot of skill crossover between Puppeteer and Rakugo performer, right, but it's also.

425
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:48,820
Speaker 1: it's one of those also acting it's you know but it's also one of those art forms that sort of self reinforcing and that because it builds up this repertoire of Rakugo specific tropes.

426
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:55,860
Speaker 1: Those can then sort of feed on themselves and provide this like even further meta layer of storytelling.

427
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:05,331
Speaker 0: I've anyway all of I've experienced in Rakugo is that it is a very positive and awesome thing is a Great, you know a piece of like really Japanese culture.

428
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:05,953
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

429
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:07,780
Speaker 0: And I enjoy it and I like it.

430
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,020
Speaker 0: So I saw this anime about it and I'm like damn I should watch that but I didn't even though it was on Crunchyroll.

431
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:17,060
Speaker 0: And then the manga came out and I'm like, oh, I'll just get that instead.

432
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:23,331
Speaker 0: So I got the first volume of manga and I read it and then I said hey rim Read this if we could do an episode and he actually read it.

433
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:23,954
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

434
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:25,038
Speaker 1: Well one Rakugo.

435
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:27,475
Speaker 1: I mean, duh Yeah, and also it was short.

436
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:31,371
Speaker 1: Volume one was yeah, we only read volume one full disclosure.

437
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:34,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, but written by a Haruko Kumota, I don't know I don't know.

438
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:45,593
Speaker 1: I never heard of them before but published by Kodansha Which usually it's I guess the interesting thing is that it is ostensibly a Jose manga So it's aimed ostensibly at middle-aged women.

439
00:31:45,995 --> 00:31:54,340
Speaker 1: Okay, which I can see Sure based on the story, but the story seems pretty good because it's actually got a bunch of elements.

440
00:31:54,721 --> 00:32:00,559
Speaker 1: There's sort of interweaving but it's very human like if there's nothing really fantastical about it or anything.

441
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:06,020
Speaker 1: and The short version of my review before we go to get into the details is that I'll read volume two.

442
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:07,812
Speaker 0: No, okay, you can read volume two.

443
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:08,820
Speaker 1: I would keep going with this.

444
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,260
Speaker 1: I thoroughly enjoyed it and I feel like though I have not seen the anime.

445
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:27,480
Speaker 1: I think I would prefer to just read the manga because I don't know if anime could add much and the reason for that is that a big part of the way this manga is Put together is that it never really goes through a full rocker go performance.

446
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:31,195
Speaker 0: You don't actually see a lot of rocker go happening like they talk about.

447
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:32,400
Speaker 0: it'd be like even one piece.

448
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:33,847
Speaker 0: You didn't see the fights.

449
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:38,888
Speaker 0: You just saw like oh love you went to fight someone and then afterwards It's like well, you really kicked his ass.

450
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:42,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, they don't show a lot of the rocker go in the manga.

451
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,732
Speaker 0: Just you know, they give you a sense like ah someone is performing.

452
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,036
Speaker 0: This is the thing they're performing.

453
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:48,100
Speaker 0: They're doing a good job.

454
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,488
Speaker 0: They're doing a bad job, you know, this is the mood of the of the situation But it's only be like a couple panels.

455
00:32:54,709 --> 00:33:03,500
Speaker 0: It's sort of like the inverse of no down make on table that music And it was able to spend like I think showing you the whole musical performance played the whole song Everyone's crying in real time.

456
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:12,159
Speaker 1: But reading the manga was not actually that satisfying unless you know the music that well And if you don't then you're gonna miss a lot, which is why the anime is a little bit.

457
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm actually plays the rock Mon and off and you hear it and you feel it.

458
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:16,820
Speaker 1: and they do a good job.

459
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:35,684
Speaker 1: but here with rocker go Actually doing the performance I think would take away from it because The manga does a good job of sort of showing like one frame of the person making one face than making a different face or like a few of the words or like a few of the plot points of the rocker girl story.

460
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:45,472
Speaker 1: they're telling give you the gist of it and then Instead it just gives you an impression of how powerful that performance was Unless your imagination run away with

461
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:53,120
Speaker 0: is using animation I don't think or even just filming a rocker go performance with a camera as opposed to sitting there in person.

462
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,980
Speaker 0: You know, it's sort of like watching a Broadway show just on video, right?

463
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,320
Speaker 1: If you say it's the same like I don't know what to say to you, right?

464
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,100
Speaker 0: It's like the power is taken out of it.

465
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:12,760
Speaker 0: So I don't think it's possible or at least extremely extremely difficult to capture rocker Go performance by animating the actual the performance, right?

466
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:18,627
Speaker 0: Even if you got a rocker go person to come in and do the voice acting for it It like it wouldn't come across.

467
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:26,755
Speaker 0: so even if you were trying to pretend like whoa that person did a great job But you as the viewers who just watch that same performers wouldn't feel that they did a good job.

468
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:27,719
Speaker 0: So it wouldn't work.

469
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:39,500
Speaker 1: Yep, right cuz whenever you have like if initial D showed just like really bad car animation as Opposed to really bad people animation initially would not be worth watching.

470
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:49,971
Speaker 0: Anyways, so the plot here is sort of different from other, you know, typical anime plots like say an initial D Where oh, there's someone who's secretly the master.

471
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:51,858
Speaker 0: It's like no there's someone who's already the master.

472
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:54,299
Speaker 0: There's another master who is dead.

473
00:34:55,022 --> 00:35:03,785
Speaker 0: The other master who is dead's daughter lives with the master who is still alive who seems to believe that the alive master Caused his dad.

474
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:10,831
Speaker 0: living with someone who you believe murdered your father, which is already like, okay Doesn't make a lot of sense and there's definitely something up with him.

475
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:14,448
Speaker 1: Yes, he has Yakuza connection, right?

476
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:21,700
Speaker 0: Even though he is a master of rock ago He's not like you usually think of like a wise master like someone you just you just look up to them.

477
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,070
Speaker 0: They're great like a. you know, it's a lot of characters like that.

478
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,220
Speaker 0: and then yeah, right where it's like crazy bunta.

479
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:27,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, crazy bunta.

480
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:29,434
Speaker 0: It's just like there's not any negative thing about them.

481
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:30,680
Speaker 0: It's like they're just the master.

482
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,182
Speaker 0: It's like no.

483
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:36,520
Speaker 0: this master who's still alive while he's amazing at rock ago seems totally shady and untrustworthy.

484
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,000
Speaker 0: Well, I guess all but he's also complex.

485
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:48,358
Speaker 1: what I appreciate is that all these characters that we know of in this manga are More complex and human than I typically expect when I pick up some random comic.

486
00:35:48,458 --> 00:36:02,667
Speaker 1: Yep, and their motivations are reasonable in so far as you can read them and Like this guy acts in a complex manner like he doesn't always react the way you would expect but you watch it usually boots of reacts Exactly the way you would expect.

487
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,033
Speaker 0: he's just a trope character.

488
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:05,258
Speaker 0: He's a wise old master.

489
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:08,490
Speaker 0: the trope There's no the characters in this are not tropes of any kind.

490
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,557
Speaker 1: So, uh, the main character.

491
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:11,440
Speaker 0: They're not cliche.

492
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,805
Speaker 0: The main character is really weird.

493
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:15,958
Speaker 0: It's a random dude who just walks up to the master on the manga.

494
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,724
Speaker 0: This is really disjointed.

495
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,615
Speaker 0: I think actually I really don't like this cuz it's like do like.

496
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:21,900
Speaker 0: it's such a bad setup.

497
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:23,172
Speaker 0: You're like what the hell's going on.

498
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:25,745
Speaker 1: I like it because Does the stir?

499
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:28,275
Speaker 1: it buries the lead the the main characters.

500
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:33,876
Speaker 0: nice that it's different But it's it's like yeah, you follow the rules of storytelling for a reason.

501
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:34,880
Speaker 0: It's like you just threw me in.

502
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,119
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck's going on here.

503
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:41,017
Speaker 0: But basically there's a random dude just goes up to the master on the street and is like make me your apprentice.

504
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,327
Speaker 0: and the master Has never taken an apprentice before.

505
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:43,750
Speaker 0: and he does.

506
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,620
Speaker 0: and that's like literally how it starts like page one.

507
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I don't know who this guy is.

508
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:54,831
Speaker 1: You don't know this masters, you know, nothing in multiple of the characters there's this buried lead of.

509
00:36:55,232 --> 00:37:02,816
Speaker 1: she thinks he murdered her dad and yet So little is known about that situation that it's sort of like.

510
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:05,566
Speaker 1: it sort of strikes you My father.

511
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:06,554
Speaker 0: it's like you have a father.

512
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:07,420
Speaker 0: this isn't your father.

513
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:08,101
Speaker 0: Well, yeah it's like.

514
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:13,119
Speaker 1: and then like the more you think about it the more concerned you get about what this story is actually about.

515
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,733
Speaker 1: and The main character is the craziest one because it's like yeah.

516
00:37:17,954 --> 00:37:18,757
Speaker 1: Well, I guess he was in the.

517
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:21,146
Speaker 1: he was in jail All right, he got out of jail.

518
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:21,849
Speaker 1: What it?

519
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,620
Speaker 1: what were you in jail for and what was his answer?

520
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,098
Speaker 1: He says like I don't remember.

521
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:34,587
Speaker 0: Yeah He kind of just like brushes it off and tries to move past that but meanwhile a bad dude from his past comes and tries To take him back to a life of crime.

522
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:37,420
Speaker 1: I do like how that situation resolved.

523
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:39,808
Speaker 0: I was actually my favorite part of the thing.

524
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:43,040
Speaker 0: That was a real good moment cuz it's like oh what's gonna happen here?

525
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, I don't know what else we could really say other than that I like it and I want to continue reading it.

526
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:50,726
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not.

527
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:54,100
Speaker 0: I mean I like it but it's like hardly because so I get a pay.

528
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,287
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm gonna pay money because it's sort of like.

529
00:37:57,251 --> 00:38:00,040
Speaker 0: it's you know, it's just the disjointedness of the story.

530
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,560
Speaker 0: It's like it was hard to care about the characters too much.

531
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:07,360
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, some of them are cool like the you know, the master or whatever.

532
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,731
Speaker 0: But it's like I can't care about someone.

533
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,723
Speaker 0: you didn't build you or grow me on you Just threw me in.

534
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:16,740
Speaker 0: and then you know the connections between parts of the story.

535
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,500
Speaker 0: It's almost like I mean obviously was probably released in some magazine one chapter at a time.

536
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,679
Speaker 0: Well, obviously the master to tell where the chapters are cuz suddenly it's like what we were doing this now.

537
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:44,915
Speaker 1: Clearly the live master and the dead master were in a romantic relationship Yeah, and clearly the alive master sees something of the person who is dead in this dog Conrad Kraling like Main characters why he's agreed to take an apprentice after never taking one before.

538
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,504
Speaker 1: but then he isn't actually an apprentice He's basically just a pet.

539
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:52,140
Speaker 1: and then the way the story I like how the main care the main character is the only one.

540
00:38:52,220 --> 00:39:06,038
Speaker 1: Yes, the main character somehow is gaining actual Rakugo skills yeah, and I don't know what the old man's game is No, and I don't know if he has a game or if he is also an impulsive person.

541
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,268
Speaker 1: He got game Yeah, but I liked it.

542
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:19,819
Speaker 1: and if you are interested at all in Rakugo It does a good job much like no dame cantabile or the wine one drops of God It will teach you about Rakugo.

543
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:27,204
Speaker 0: That was actually my second favorite part was as a part where someone describes like how the theaters where you go to watch Rakugo work Almost like they.

544
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 0: it was an advertisement for Rakugo, which I guess the manga partially is Yeah, but it's like oh that was very informative.

545
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:45,506
Speaker 0: And now I've actually learned a whole ton about Rakugo, which is the thing I was interested in anyway, and anytime you learn more about something you're interested in you'd feel them pretty good Yeah, but as a result It does the thing.

546
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:57,583
Speaker 1: that usually is a fault in a lot of manga where it'll leave Japanese words in many conversations Untranslated in romanji and then have a note like this is what that word means Which usually

547
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,975
Speaker 0: has a decision of the American publisher, but English this

548
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:08,437
Speaker 1: specific case Because these are all like sort of Rakugo specific words that are subtly different from

549
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:11,396
Speaker 0: say you couldn't translate the word Rakugo to something else that wouldn't work.

550
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:21,019
Speaker 1: Like you're gonna change like you're gonna change like the name for the special Rakugo theater to just the Rakugo theater Even though like that there's sort of a lot of meaning built into it.

551
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:30,470
Speaker 1: I'm not saying go full nakama like a lot of people like to but this Particular manga seems to do it in a way that is acceptable.

552
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:34,160
Speaker 1: Whereas I would not accept that from other kinds of stories.

553
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:42,450
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

554
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:47,270
