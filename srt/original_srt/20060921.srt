1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,932
Speaker 0: It's Thursday September 21st, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:14,574
Speaker 0: We discuss.

3
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,900
Speaker 0: Why ice hockey is awesome.

4
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:19,598
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:24,560
Speaker 1: You know I really can't complain about my job because they pay me better than IBM.

6
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:27,771
Speaker 1: I make quite a bit of money considering how little work.

7
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:30,059
Speaker 1: I do at least in terms of technical work.

8
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:34,552
Speaker 1: But I'm kind of thinking about looking for a new job already.

9
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:37,300
Speaker 1: Why did you get this job up like four months ago?

10
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:41,400
Speaker 0: You know I'm thinking about quitting the job that I've had for two years.

11
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,344
Speaker 0: Four months.

12
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:55,799
Speaker 1: when I first got to IBM the main reason I could bear it Was because I knew that I was going back to RIT and the day I went back to RIT from my first stint at IBM was like the happiest day in.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:05,437
Speaker 1: Well, not that it was at least in the top five of happiest days in my life Mmm because first off I was poor, but then I worked for IBM for a while.

14
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:07,985
Speaker 1: I had like $7,000 in the bank.

15
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:12,940
Speaker 1: I had just spent a month living in Wildwood, New Jersey going to the beach every day with Scott Johnson.

16
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:20,023
Speaker 1: And now I was back at RIT the president of the anime club a badass senior taking nothing But awesome classes.

17
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:25,100
Speaker 0: life was absolutely perfect, and that's why he was so expensive.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,868
Speaker 0: It's like oh you want some awesome life.

19
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,439
Speaker 0: Well you had to pay like a hajillion dollars.

20
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:32,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what two months later that $7,000 was gone.

21
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:44,029
Speaker 1: My car was almost repossessed, and I had to rely on the the Sympathy of cute girls to actually give me food.

22
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:46,155
Speaker 0: This is the way of things you know.

23
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:50,690
Speaker 0: tomorrow speaking of work tomorrow There's actually people come into my work.

24
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:54,588
Speaker 0: I'm not really yeah, they're they're coming I see at first earlier in the week.

25
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:55,251
Speaker 0: They emailed me.

26
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,180
Speaker 0: They're like are you gonna be there on Friday?

27
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:01,373
Speaker 0: I'm like yeah, they're like oh cuz we're coming to see you.

28
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,279
Speaker 0: We wanted to know make sure you were there.

29
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:05,876
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

30
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:08,228
Speaker 0: either They're coming to fire me.

31
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:14,816
Speaker 0: Which is a you know maybe cool, or They don't expect me to actually go to this place every day.

32
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:18,053
Speaker 0: They want to know if I was gonna be there.

33
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:19,380
Speaker 1: You know what they probably figured.

34
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:21,312
Speaker 1: He we haven't had him do anything in a while.

35
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,439
Speaker 1: He probably doesn't even go there.

36
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:26,300
Speaker 0: Well, they you know I'm technically doing something, but there's like no deadline or anything.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,740
Speaker 0: I'm just kind of you know have these open Tasks and I work on slowly and whenever they ask me to report on my progress.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,704
Speaker 0: They're very pleased.

39
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:35,872
Speaker 0: so I don't see I did.

40
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:37,779
Speaker 1: I handled because I had the same situation IBM.

41
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:45,180
Speaker 1: I'd absolutely no deadlines And they pretty much would give me systems or goals and say have at do what you can.

42
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:49,020
Speaker 1: I would do as much as I could because I had nothing else to do at work.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,636
Speaker 1: I mean you can only surf the internet for so long.

44
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:57,390
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, but when you go to FARC the fourth time and it still hasn't updated There's nothing left to do on the internet.

45
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,162
Speaker 0: See what I generally do is I get to work I go to everything once and then I'm done with that for like you know until like five Minutes.

46
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:06,155
Speaker 0: no until like the end of the day, but I'll check my email one.

47
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:06,215
Speaker 1: No.

48
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:07,260
Speaker 1: That's a horseshit.

49
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:12,300
Speaker 1: You're constantly chatting with me over aim, and you post in the forum somewhat regularly.

50
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,884
Speaker 1: You're always.

51
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:15,037
Speaker 0: I keep the forums in the email open.

52
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,514
Speaker 0: yeah everything else.

53
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:31,360
Speaker 1: See basically I work and read FARC and read our forum and read slash dot and chat Simultaneously no matter where I am and yet I do enough work to where they're always very pleased with what I do.

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,124
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

55
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,920
Speaker 0: the thing is like I replaced the time I would do work.

56
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:40,280
Speaker 0: I end up like reading a comic or see I can't do anything like GBA game.

57
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:42,489
Speaker 0: I mean I guess he has game.

58
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,005
Speaker 1: the thing is I do all the work I can do it's.

59
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:50,369
Speaker 1: it's not that I'm slacking from work at this new job It's more that the work is all just kind of stupid.

60
00:03:50,991 --> 00:04:04,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it's all it's all paperwork and bureaucracy and every now and then someone wants to know something technical and There is no way they understand when I explain whatever they ask to them like.

61
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:04,960
Speaker 1: people ask me like.

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Speaker 1: But the only people ask me things like how do I make this kind of formula in Excel?

63
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,198
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and I'm like equals the math.

64
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,670
Speaker 1: well No, he wanted something really complicated and weird and I was like.

65
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:22,176
Speaker 1: I don't know I could write it for you but I'll have to sit down and relearn that crap and look at the syntax a little bit.

66
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,645
Speaker 1: and It was like yeah, what do you know?

67
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:28,020
Speaker 1: but yet people ask me things like blah blah blah Linux.

68
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,152
Speaker 1: And I'm like blah blah blah blah Colonel blah blah blah blah blah like what.

69
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:32,798
Speaker 1: what did you just say?

70
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:33,219
Speaker 0: yeah?

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,120
Speaker 1: I said there's an instance recently where we needed some vendor needs remote access to some software.

72
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:44,997
Speaker 1: I can't say anything about who or what but they require PC anywhere, which is some remote access.

73
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,243
Speaker 1: Oh god That's not the thing.

74
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,428
Speaker 1: I'm getting to okay now.

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,506
Speaker 1: I go to my one of my managers, and I say all right we need a VPN To or no?

76
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,975
Speaker 1: we need remote access to this box via.

77
00:04:58,196 --> 00:04:59,360
Speaker 1: they want PC anywhere.

78
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,833
Speaker 1: And I'm about to say you think we can convince them to use something else.

79
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:05,483
Speaker 1: and the guy said no PC Anywhere is crap.

80
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:06,606
Speaker 1: I agree, and I think we.

81
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:19,272
Speaker 1: then he says we'll just give them VPN access To which I said But VPN doesn't do what we need done.

82
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,719
Speaker 1: VPN doesn't do anything by itself.

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need a little more than that I.

84
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,087
Speaker 0: That's all there's.

85
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,480
Speaker 1: just like it goes on there's just no one's technical.

86
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,420
Speaker 1: I'm in an IT firm that does a lot of awesome stuff, but no one really knows a lot about the technology at all.

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,464
Speaker 1: It's kind of frightening.

88
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that would be frightening, but anyway.

89
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:42,943
Speaker 0: No they're not coming to fire me they're not.

90
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:49,971
Speaker 0: they're coming to bring the new furniture to this empty office where only I work and They told me to bring a box cutter to work tomorrow.

91
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:50,775
Speaker 0: We have one right?

92
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,647
Speaker 1: no Okay, I have one.

93
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:56,520
Speaker 0: Uh I'll just buy one at the hardware store on the way to work.

94
00:05:56,942 --> 00:06:00,299
Speaker 1: I wouldn't bring out if I bribed my work said to buy a tool and bring it to work.

95
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,528
Speaker 0: I didn't say to buy a tool.

96
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:03,291
Speaker 0: They said bring one.

97
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,319
Speaker 0: if you have one I wouldn't bring one.

98
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:11,416
Speaker 1: Of course then again my work won't let me crimp cables or anything so I can't even bring all my tools to work.

99
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:19,494
Speaker 0: Wow well Anyway, the point is is that hey, you know they think I'm doing a great job and tomorrow They're gonna be like hey, what's up?

100
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:20,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird.

101
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:23,154
Speaker 1: We both work for companies that think we're doing a great job, and yet.

102
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:26,478
Speaker 1: We're doing maybe 2% of what we could be doing for them.

103
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:33,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you know as soon as like I you know don't have things to distract me from doing work.

104
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:44,254
Speaker 1: You know what the most common joke people make when they walk by my cube at work is They see me typing or they hear me typing and I type really fast And they always say something like slow down you'll get us all fired.

105
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:47,428
Speaker 1: Hey yuk yuk yuk Wow like what are you trying to do?

106
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,760
Speaker 1: put us out of a job or the Union will get you.

107
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,626
Speaker 0: You should be like if I was the manager.

108
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,614
Speaker 0: you would be a homeless bum.

109
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,360
Speaker 1: I mean they all do their jobs.

110
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,630
Speaker 1: It's just I'm sitting with a bunch of administrative types, and I don't have any contact with the technical people But yet I'm paid more than some of the technical.

111
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,192
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

112
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:05,800
Speaker 1: I don't know.

113
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,280
Speaker 1: It's like I'm lower middle management at this point.

114
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:24,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I need a job being like see the thing is right now I'm like an individual worker But after working on teams Forcing to be working on teams like forever I really I want to work on a team of like a bunch of guys who are smarter than me.

115
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:31,723
Speaker 1: Working on teams is great because in the corporate world I found that team means you are no longer responsible for anything that's done.

116
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,918
Speaker 1: everyone else is stupid and won't do their work.

117
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:43,488
Speaker 1: and When the axe comes to chop off the heads of everyone who fucked it up You'll have all the copies of the emails you sent to people tell them what to do And proof that they didn't respond to.

118
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:50,874
Speaker 0: work on like one big piece of software with a bunch of other Programmers who are all smarter than me and then I'll actually work hard and it'll be awesome.

119
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:51,616
Speaker 0: That's what I want.

120
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,579
Speaker 0: or even better I have a bunch of programmers who were less smart than me.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,020
Speaker 0: But I'll be like the team like boss and I'll have to organize these dudes and get them to do my bidding.

122
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:02,023
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way.

123
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:05,917
Speaker 1: I have never in all of my years of work been given a task.

124
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:14,056
Speaker 1: That was not either impossible as in actually impossible or So unbelievably mundane.

125
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:19,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, there's never been a challenging interesting project like all the projects.

126
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,779
Speaker 0: They've given me are pretty much it.

127
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,345
Speaker 0: That's my real problem.

128
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:34,220
Speaker 0: The reason I'm not like, you know, super excited on finishing all the work right away Is because the work I'm given the projects they assigned to me aren't anything that requires thinking or solving of problems.

129
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,448
Speaker 0: It's simply implementing a known solution.

130
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:37,811
Speaker 0: It's like.

131
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:41,683
Speaker 0: I already know how to make Scott you realize Database driven website.

132
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:46,479
Speaker 0: I just had to make like a million database driven websites that are real big and I'm there.

133
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:46,800
Speaker 0: That's it.

134
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,906
Speaker 0: It's well, you realize.

135
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,334
Speaker 0: so it's not mindless.

136
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:49,897
Speaker 0: God God.

137
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:55,979
Speaker 1: You realize that probably less than 1% of companies needs you to solve unsolved problems.

138
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,490
Speaker 0: There doesn't have to be an unsolved problem.

139
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,660
Speaker 0: It has to be a problem that I haven't solved.

140
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:13,548
Speaker 1: um, the vast majority of computer science work is writing bullshit little programs for companies that don't realize a solution already exists or Customizing something that already exists for a company just like IT.

141
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:18,407
Speaker 1: It's all just support or like putting in a network or building a server.

142
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,090
Speaker 1: There's nothing special.

143
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's work out there.

144
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,282
Speaker 1: See I got some hope though because next week I've been invited to have breakfast with the CEO of the company.

145
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,850
Speaker 0: Didn't you see the CEO of the company before?

146
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:33,609
Speaker 1: Yeah with a whole bunch of new hire people and I asked him one technical question and he didn't really answer it.

147
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:43,872
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but this is a smaller thing and I'm pretty much gonna tell him straight up a thing I think the company can do to make a shit ton of money and I'm gonna try to convince him to put me in Charge of it.

148
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:44,697
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

149
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:45,984
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna go balls out.

150
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:52,235
Speaker 0: That's a good idea Cuz I never tried, you know, you always think is something like that And I'm not gonna say what it is.

151
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,500
Speaker 1: cuz you know the what.

152
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:53,962
Speaker 1: it's weird.

153
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:56,070
Speaker 1: This company didn't make me sign any NDA's.

154
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:57,476
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're really.

155
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,982
Speaker 1: I don't know what they're thinking.

156
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:09,598
Speaker 1: cuz I probably could talk about all this stuff But I'm not going to because if I work for any of the other companies I've worked for they'd kill me if I said what I could say Yeah, no but that's great because I used to think you know.

157
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:20,930
Speaker 0: trying to tell the bosses what to do or act like you know better and Tell them all your crazy ideas is a dumb thing because 99 percent of the time your ideas are dumb And you just don't know why because we're not businessmen.

158
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:25,470
Speaker 0: See no, but now I read a thing recently that says no you got to tell the crazy ideas.

159
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:31,510
Speaker 1: I used to think it depends Do you are you more worried about the chance of something awesome or the chance of a promotion?

160
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:39,680
Speaker 1: Because if you make the bosses look stupid Then you're probably never gonna get promoted even though you'll do good Unless your boss is one of those smart ones.

161
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,368
Speaker 1: or your idea is that good?

162
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,010
Speaker 0: Mmm, but I've learned because it also depends if your idea makes money.

163
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,749
Speaker 0: I mean it could be a great idea that makes no money.

164
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:53,470
Speaker 1: Well like an IBM I ran to a lot of situations where I'd say why don't we do X and the business guys all say?

165
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,248
Speaker 1: Because of blah blah blah blah.

166
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,663
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of times.

167
00:10:56,684 --> 00:11:03,790
Speaker 0: you go be like hey Why don't we do this and buy one of these and we'll have perfect security because that is a spending thing that knows no money.

168
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,815
Speaker 1: That was never the answer.

169
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,820
Speaker 1: They gave me the answer.

170
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,054
Speaker 1: I was always given was no That's not how it's done.

171
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,663
Speaker 1: or know that you know?

172
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:15,296
Speaker 1: my SQL solution isn't Scalable buzzword buzzword.

173
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:20,457
Speaker 1: you need the enterprise Oracle buzzword buzzword because that's how the industry works And you just don't understand that.

174
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,868
Speaker 1: Oracle buzzword buzzword is better than those.

175
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,602
Speaker 0: people Need a bludgeon on the head because they don't know.

176
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,950
Speaker 1: that's the most of the industry.

177
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't know shit.

178
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:35,330
Speaker 1: But anyway, maybe I'll tell you the idea off the air because if nothing else we should just start a company that does this.

179
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:43,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can't do the coding part because I'm not a coder at all But I got a handle on everything else anyway.

180
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,056
Speaker 1: News yeah news all right.

181
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:49,568
Speaker 1: I'll do mine first because you'll think this is stupid news all right.

182
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,190
Speaker 1: You'll hate it.

183
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,582
Speaker 1: Okay, I think it's great, and I think most people out there will agree with me.

184
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:54,124
Speaker 1: Okay.

185
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,850
Speaker 1: I hate McDonald's food.

186
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,270
Speaker 0: I also hate McDonald's food.

187
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,350
Speaker 1: I'm like not like for ideological reasons cuz I used to eat it when I was a kid.

188
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:12,390
Speaker 1: But McDonald's I ate it when I was a kid too and Burger King and pretty much any fast food other than a few Select items that a few select places and I've been known to eat a chicken McNugget and anything on the White Castle menu.

189
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,198
Speaker 1: Oh, I love White Castle.

190
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:19,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, makes me nauseous like McDonald's burgers Make me physically ill and I'll usually have diarrhea.

191
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get sick.

192
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:20,546
Speaker 0: Just looking at him.

193
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,730
Speaker 1: no I don't get sick looking at him, but I get sick if I actually eat them.

194
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just don't eat fast food.

195
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:28,387
Speaker 0: however for rare rare occasions There is one.

196
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:35,590
Speaker 1: No There's one thing that is perhaps one of the greatest things ever given unto man by technology and that is the McDonald's breakfast bargo.

197
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,271
Speaker 1: McDonald's breakfast sandwiches are so Amazing.

198
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:41,395
Speaker 1: bargo.

199
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:48,941
Speaker 1: see you never had that experience of you know waking up at 9 o'clock And looking around and realizing that it's before 11.

200
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,410
Speaker 1: I can go and get a McDonald's breakfast.

201
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,760
Speaker 0: I mean, how many times I'll eat an eggo waffle.

202
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,167
Speaker 1: I'll better off now how many times would I go?

203
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:00,230
Speaker 1: eggos are disgusting, too.

204
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:04,630
Speaker 0: You're telling me eggos are disgusting, but a McDonald's breakfast is okay.

205
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,490
Speaker 1: So how many times would I go out?

206
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,450
Speaker 1: You know I wake up and it's like 10 10 and I think I want a McDonald's breakfast.

207
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:16,161
Speaker 1: I try to go get it But then they're not serving breakfast anymore because they stop serving it.

208
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:21,719
Speaker 1: well it seems that McDonald's Recognizes my plight and is trying to rectify this.

209
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,189
Speaker 1: you see the only reason McDonald's doesn't have breakfast all the time Is that the way their restaurant?

210
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:27,330
Speaker 1: well?

211
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,334
Speaker 1: I wouldn't call them a restaurant.

212
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,183
Speaker 1: the way their kitchen wouldn't call it a kitchen.

213
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:36,559
Speaker 1: the way they're they're processed food factory Mini mini food factory.

214
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:43,903
Speaker 1: the way their slot price is put together Is that you can only make a set number of things at one time.

215
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:47,909
Speaker 1: like things are dual purpose you can't make breakfast sandwiches and burgers at the same time.

216
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:53,928
Speaker 1: They've only retooled their kitchens a couple of times in the past and the last time they did it was fairly recent.

217
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,797
Speaker 1: all this stuff I read you don't care about.

218
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,910
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about making more efficient kitchens.

219
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know about making less efficient kitchens on purpose.

220
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,470
Speaker 1: Why it's like I said, I don't want to get into it.

221
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,093
Speaker 0: Oh god.

222
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:07,089
Speaker 1: I'll do a whole show on this shit all right now.

223
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:08,573
Speaker 0: The thing

224
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:27,670
Speaker 1: is they're talking about how they're gonna try to retool the kitchen so that they can have some breakfast items available 24/7 because places like Tim Hortons and Dunkin Donuts are starting to kill them in the late-night market Because the late-night market is comprised mostly of college students and punk kids who all want their breakfasts.

225
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, generally, that's that's what that is.

226
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,070
Speaker 0: a lot of people want breakfast.

227
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,570
Speaker 0: You know later, and I mean how many times to go to the diner for dinner and you get waffles or French toast.

228
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:42,387
Speaker 1: I probably ordered breakfast at diners more than I've ordered any other food at diners ever.

229
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,495
Speaker 0: yeah brats I think that's exactly right.

230
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,720
Speaker 0: I I mean yet.

231
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,290
Speaker 1: I know I rarely go to diners at breakfast time.

232
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:56,293
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean until very recently I pretty much should only order breakfast at diners because I was always afraid that the other food would be Nasty.

233
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,601
Speaker 1: you know the foods not nasty.

234
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,170
Speaker 1: It's great until you get food poisoning.

235
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,190
Speaker 0: So breakfast is all.

236
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,927
Speaker 0: It's bread and sugar and fruit.

237
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:10,305
Speaker 1: Anyway, my nose a breakfast consists comprised mostly of egg meat more meat and more egg.

238
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,578
Speaker 0: egg and meat can also be included As long as that meat is bacon.

239
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,933
Speaker 1: No it's got to be sausage Canadian bacon.

240
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:17,756
Speaker 0: no it's not good.

241
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:18,840
Speaker 1: or a breakfast steak.

242
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,667
Speaker 0: I'm okay with the breakfast, and that's not good either.

243
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:21,510
Speaker 0: steak is a dinner.

244
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,849
Speaker 1: Anyway steak and eggs no.

245
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,940
Speaker 1: So what kind of BS news do you have?

246
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,447
Speaker 1: you can't beat the McDonald's breakfast.

247
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:28,990
Speaker 0: so link?

248
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:30,880
Speaker 0: You know the guy with the sword in the shield.

249
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:32,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's left-handed.

250
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,899
Speaker 1: Yep, you probably didn't know that.

251
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,265
Speaker 0: yeah, you probably never noticed.

252
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:36,687
Speaker 1: You know what?

253
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:38,553
Speaker 1: our listeners They probably all knew that.

254
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:44,489
Speaker 0: yeah, probably, but if you didn't know link you know link to quote who comes to town?

255
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,185
Speaker 1: He saved the day.

256
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:49,030
Speaker 0: yeah He has always been left-handed.

257
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:54,841
Speaker 0: The shield has always been held in the right is great and the sword has always been held in the left And that is the way it has been.

258
00:15:54,882 --> 00:16:04,160
Speaker 0: however Zelda Wii is coming out and Apparently Miyamoto realized that most people are right-handed.

259
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,460
Speaker 1: so first off this news is basically a big Double deuce to anyone who's actually left-handed.

260
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,527
Speaker 0: well no no no cuz they get.

261
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:15,883
Speaker 0: so You know what happened was a lot of people were swinging the wheeze.

262
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:19,902
Speaker 0: you know sword with their right hand But would link is holding it in the left hand.

263
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:26,227
Speaker 0: that didn't work out so well You know cuz it's kind of weird to sweat feel like you're swinging a sword in your right But the guy on screen swings his left hand around.

264
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:32,030
Speaker 1: well You know there was a big controversy in counter-strike way back when they switched it from being left-handed to being right-handed.

265
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:32,998
Speaker 0: Well, you could choose.

266
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,068
Speaker 0: you could always configure.

267
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:39,369
Speaker 1: well Yeah, but it wasn't always obvious right away, and originally you couldn't and people bitch about it to no end.

268
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,303
Speaker 0: I like the right-handed guns actually in counter-strike better.

269
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:42,865
Speaker 1: Well.

270
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:43,146
Speaker 1: That's cuz.

271
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:43,910
Speaker 1: you started with those.

272
00:16:45,357 --> 00:17:02,570
Speaker 0: No No, not really yeah, no I remember when they switched also, okay The reason I like right-handed guns better is because when I usually would hide on the left side Of an open doorway, and then I would come around the right So I'd be able to see the guy sooner and my gun wouldn't block him What

273
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:03,314
Speaker 1: is counter-strike?

274
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:06,025
Speaker 1: I usually hit on top of the door with a hostage stuck to me.

275
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:08,922
Speaker 0: that works, too anyway.

276
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:13,950
Speaker 0: anyway Zelda we they made it where link left-handed because links left-handed.

277
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:21,367
Speaker 0: But then they you know because they've realized people are right-handed, and they're gonna be swinging the sword They flipped the entire game.

278
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:26,569
Speaker 1: now That is not as stupid as you might think because they designed the game very precisely.

279
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,279
Speaker 1: So a lot of the puzzles were meant.

280
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,370
Speaker 1: so you're looking at it, and you'll react with your left hand to it.

281
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:33,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll be like a lot of fights.

282
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:44,763
Speaker 0: We're like let's say there's a bad guy, and you have to sneak around the bad guy and then hit him You know with a certain sword But if he's against a wall that can totally screw up the game making a guy harder to hit.

283
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,658
Speaker 0: and you know game design isn't As simple as you think.

284
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,447
Speaker 0: there's a lot to it.

285
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:54,436
Speaker 0: But if you just mirror the entire game including all the maps and all the levels and everything They don't do anything else.

286
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:57,110
Speaker 0: It's just what one switch and the whole thing's perfect.

287
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,210
Speaker 0: However, if you are left-handed there is going to be an option for left-handed link, but it won't be left-handed world.

288
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:11,330
Speaker 1: No, it'll be right-handed world And you'll be just like you are in real life a left-handed man or woman in a right-handed world.

289
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,408
Speaker 0: Yep, so you'll be used to that and there's no left or him.

290
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:21,132
Speaker 0: yeah The thing is you know people are still uncertain because there is still a GameCube version of Twilight.

291
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,422
Speaker 1: they already said that the GameCube version is also going to be flipped.

292
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:25,205
Speaker 0: did they cuz I?

293
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:33,450
Speaker 0: I didn't because I saw a Link that said so-and-so confirms GameCube version also flipped, but when I clicked on the link it didn't say anything like that.

294
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,035
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't follow the link.

295
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:35,336
Speaker 0: Yes.

296
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:36,439
Speaker 0: I'm not sure at all.

297
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:37,262
Speaker 1: get it the link.

298
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:39,048
Speaker 0: I'm fairly not.

299
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:39,409
Speaker 0: link.

300
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:46,870
Speaker 0: yes I'm fairly certain that Nintendo won't release a game on two systems where one game is totally flipped from the other game.

301
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,395
Speaker 1: now Here's some brilliant marketing.

302
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:49,178
Speaker 1: if they did.

303
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,010
Speaker 1: they could have two different versions of the strategy guide.

304
00:18:52,653 --> 00:19:03,254
Speaker 0: They could have a lot of nuts would probably buy both to get the full experience I might but not like right away like I'd wait for the GameCube version to be wicked cheap like five You know 20.

305
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,950
Speaker 1: how weird would that be to play like imagine playing Mario?

306
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,547
Speaker 1: Somebody make a flash version of Mario Brothers 1 that's identical except you play from right to left.

307
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:13,490
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

308
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:14,454
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

309
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:15,177
Speaker 0: We got to do that.

310
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:16,744
Speaker 0: That's brilliant genius.

311
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:17,648
Speaker 1: That'll get that.

312
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:22,890
Speaker 1: That is going to be the front row cruise project at least one level of it because we can do that.

313
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:26,410
Speaker 1: We can do that easily right to left Mario right to left Mario.

314
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,770
Speaker 0: But we just took Zelda 1 and we took the whole Matt every map and just went whoop like we kept the game exactly the same.

315
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,420
Speaker 0: We just flipped them the whole overworld.

316
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,250
Speaker 0: so the graveyard was in the top right instead of the top left.

317
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:41,789
Speaker 1: I think I'd rather do the Mario one because that would be so weird.

318
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:42,895
Speaker 0: God would that be?

319
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,805
Speaker 1: well the Zelda one wouldn't be that weird just like a new man.

320
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:45,951
Speaker 0: see you know This.

321
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:51,810
Speaker 0: the thing is is this problem was solved way back in the day by a very old game known as pitfall.

322
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,476
Speaker 1: You can go either way.

323
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:58,288
Speaker 0: you could go both ways in pitfall like a bisexual.

324
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:10,033
Speaker 0: Yes, Ted That was the joke, but the thing is in pitfall even though I was right-handed I would go left because it was easier to jump over the logs and the snakes and all that business because they would always come From the right.

325
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:15,532
Speaker 0: so you just keep running to the left and nothing would ever catch you because everything went at the same speed as Pitfall.

326
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:17,182
Speaker 1: Harry plus when you die.

327
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:22,329
Speaker 1: I don't recall which way it went But if you died you always started on the left side of whatever screen you died on.

328
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:22,550
Speaker 0: yeah.

329
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,950
Speaker 0: So if you did get hit while you ran onto a screen you'd skip over that screen immediately.

330
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,649
Speaker 0: It was pretty good, so yeah pitfall run to the left.

331
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:32,537
Speaker 0: Hello out there.

332
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:33,682
Speaker 0: We're on the air.

333
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:35,369
Speaker 0: It's hockey night tonight.

334
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:43,142
Speaker 0: Tension goes the whistle blows and the puck goes down the ice The goalie jumps and the players bump on.

335
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:44,970
Speaker 0: the fans all go insane.

336
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:49,548
Speaker 0: Someone roars Bobby scores at the good old hockey game.

337
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:55,970
Speaker 1: now This is the end of hockey fight week, so we have to end with pretty much the two best hockey fights ever.

338
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:03,071
Speaker 0: Well, there's one problem with that is I realized I used the best hockey fight ever as a thing of the day before hockey fight Week.

339
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,016
Speaker 0: what was I thinking?

340
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:06,126
Speaker 1: not only that but the best hockey fight?

341
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:06,990
Speaker 1: I ever saw personally.

342
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,674
Speaker 1: There is no video of it I can find.

343
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:14,789
Speaker 1: all I can say is that I was there and Every player on both teams was fighting except the two goalies who were staying out of it.

344
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:21,370
Speaker 1: Um the refs were fighting the managers the teams were fighting the coaches were fighting and the crowd was fighting.

345
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:28,046
Speaker 1: The crowd jumped onto the ice and there was a massive brawl My dad and my little brother, and I had to get the hell out of there.

346
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:28,830
Speaker 1: It was fantastic.

347
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,032
Speaker 0: Sweet now.

348
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,906
Speaker 1: no uh my hockey fight today is a very important historical hockey fight.

349
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,350
Speaker 1: that illustrates a number of points.

350
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,629
Speaker 1: I think it is the best way I could end hockey fight week.

351
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:44,025
Speaker 1: Now you might watch the video and wonder why is it in black and white rim?

352
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:45,230
Speaker 1: Why is there no sound?

353
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:47,100
Speaker 1: Why does it look like it's from the 50s?

354
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:47,925
Speaker 1: well?

355
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:48,689
Speaker 1: It's from?

356
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:57,589
Speaker 1: 1955 and it's of a very famous hockey player Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens involved in a spectacular fight.

357
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:08,950
Speaker 1: Now one thing that you should notice when you watch this video is that hockey fights in 1955 looked exactly the same as hockey fights in 2006.

358
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,613
Speaker 1: Nothing's different.

359
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,662
Speaker 1: It looks like the guys fight.

360
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:18,800
Speaker 1: Jersey comes up guy gets knocked down They do that little dance where they're kind of like you want to fight The ref just kind of stand there and hold them.

361
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:19,644
Speaker 1: it's identical.

362
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:20,750
Speaker 1: hockey hasn't changed?

363
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, unlike all these other sports.

364
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,126
Speaker 1: well no hockey culture hasn't changed.

365
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:31,850
Speaker 1: hockey has changed quite a bit And in fact hockey has changed a lot this year in ways that we might touch on briefly at the end of this episode.

366
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:32,392
Speaker 1: Maybe.

367
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:34,420
Speaker 1: but no there's more to this fight than that.

368
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:37,010
Speaker 1: if it had just been an old hockey fight that wouldn't been anything.

369
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:44,070
Speaker 1: But Maurice Richard was a very very famous hockey player one of the most famous ever at least in Canada.

370
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:52,165
Speaker 1: he's effectively a national hero and In 1955 the fight you were watching you can't tell but he's fighting with some other player.

371
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:52,907
Speaker 1: I forget who it was.

372
00:22:52,927 --> 00:23:01,708
Speaker 1: and While they're fighting the linesman Jerry LaFlamme comes in to break the fight up And he takes the linesman out to.

373
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:03,938
Speaker 1: Linesman is like a mini referee.

374
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he takes that guy out.

375
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:07,414
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

376
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,910
Speaker 1: that is a match penalty meaning you get banned from hockey for a while.

377
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,602
Speaker 1: So he was banned from hockey.

378
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:17,805
Speaker 1: as a result He'd the team lost the Stanley Cup to the Red Wings.

379
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:24,045
Speaker 1: as a result There was a riot where the president of the NHL was attacked by fans of the Canadians.

380
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:25,730
Speaker 1: It was absolute chaos.

381
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,174
Speaker 0: No, oh my god.

382
00:23:27,194 --> 00:23:28,438
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

383
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,194
Speaker 1: So yes, this video is very cool, and I suggest you watch it Alright.

384
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:42,790
Speaker 0: my hockey fight since the you know Super-amazing hockey fight that lasted half a game or an entire period is already been used as a thing of the day in the past.

385
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,983
Speaker 0: I'm going to talk about just a hockey trip a guy.

386
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:49,390
Speaker 0: He got tripped and he fell down.

387
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:58,604
Speaker 0: However in the course of this the most famous picture in sports ever The most famous photograph in all of sports was taken.

388
00:23:58,664 --> 00:23:59,870
Speaker 1: you've probably seen it.

389
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:00,995
Speaker 0: You've probably seen it.

390
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:02,622
Speaker 0: and if you haven't what's wrong with you?

391
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,610
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen this picture You don't know what I'm talking about.

392
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:12,927
Speaker 0: You need to even if you never look at the things that they before ever Need to go to front row crew comm and click on this link and see this picture.

393
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,094
Speaker 0: now Let me set this up for you.

394
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:21,010
Speaker 0: this Bobby or who basically is probably the best defenseman in hockey ever.

395
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,510
Speaker 0: He changed what it meant to be a defenseman in ice hockey.

396
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:35,245
Speaker 0: He like used the most scoring defenseman ever like when he came out and you know started playing hockey for the Boston Bruins And then he just kept scoring more and more goals every season.

397
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:40,904
Speaker 0: and he was just like amazing Like, you know one of the like guys like on the Wayne Gretzky level.

398
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,570
Speaker 0: exhaust Wayne Gretzky's number one.

399
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,187
Speaker 0: so he's like in the next tier right under that, you know, the amazing hockey players of all time.

400
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:56,343
Speaker 0: and 1970 the Boston Bruins were in the Stanley Cup finals against the st Louis Blues who weren't as good and it was the fourth game.

401
00:24:56,504 --> 00:25:01,969
Speaker 0: and the Bruins, you know They'd won the previous three games and they're probably gonna win the Stanley Cup on this night.

402
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:05,610
Speaker 0: Well Bobby or came in in his usual fashion.

403
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:11,307
Speaker 0: it was going to score a goal that was gonna be the game-winning goal and win him the Stanley Cup with his goal.

404
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:24,673
Speaker 0: as He was scoring this goal to win the Stanley Cup the greatest trophy ever made he got tripped and he was sent flying through the air headfirst and For a moment, he was.

405
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:33,729
Speaker 0: he was like few feet off the ice and he was completely horizontal Like Superman flying except he's about to fall on his face.

406
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:34,952
Speaker 0: And he he was.

407
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:36,796
Speaker 0: he knew he just won the Stanley Cup.

408
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,771
Speaker 0: So his arms were way up like whoa Hope.

409
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:54,690
Speaker 0: he was completely horizontal and at that exact moment Ray Lucey of the Boston Herald Pushed the button on his camera and he took perhaps the greatest picture in all sports ever.

410
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,743
Speaker 1: See, that's one thing about hockey that I mean.

411
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,450
Speaker 1: other sports have their iconic pictures.

412
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:07,409
Speaker 1: I mean there are famous pictures in soccer and everything but There are so many more of those kinds of pictures in hockey just because of the way hockey is.

413
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:12,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you've never seen this picture, you don't know what I'm talking about.

414
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,993
Speaker 0: It might be called the dive the trip, you know, the Superman whatever It's Bobby.

415
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:28,986
Speaker 0: or if you search for Bobby or on Google Images, you're going to see this picture like a thousand times Bobby or our Bobby or one of the greatest hockey players ever most famous picture ever.

416
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:30,029
Speaker 0: go look at it.

417
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:37,170
Speaker 1: So anyway, we had you know hockey fight week for the last week and we're gonna end it with a bit of talk about hockey.

418
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:41,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know a lot of geeks and nerds and people out there might not like ice hockey.

419
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,350
Speaker 0: They might not appreciate it as you know much as we do.

420
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:55,630
Speaker 1: They might be wondering what the hell what's up with these geeks and their hockey liking now, of course one I want to note that it's nerds who generally dislike sports because geek is a much more broad term and there are sports geeks.

421
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:56,654
Speaker 0: There are indeed.

422
00:26:56,734 --> 00:27:03,117
Speaker 1: I mean there are people who are geeky about sports the way you're geeky about video games Yep, and so we decided to do a little episode.

423
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:12,026
Speaker 0: just a quick thing about why we like hockey so much and perhaps maybe You will begin to see hockey the way we see it and think it's awesome or perhaps not.

424
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:21,310
Speaker 1: now in the very least I know a lot of you are in college and if you're in college and you're in a place where there is hockey because there Aren't that many places you might be in college below the Messier line.

425
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,215
Speaker 0: And if that's the case, what can I say?

426
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:28,250
Speaker 1: or you might be in sub-saharan Africa or I don't know where there's not hockey.

427
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:39,869
Speaker 0: in A lot of places you pretty much have to either be in Europe Russia is a good place Ukraine is very good Canada all of Canada or the northern United States or Alaska.

428
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,200
Speaker 0: Are those the only places where hockey exists really?

429
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,168
Speaker 1: Well, we're hockey as we know.

430
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:45,590
Speaker 1: it exists.

431
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,500
Speaker 1: There's high elsewhere, but it's not the same field.

432
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,276
Speaker 1: hockey is what even when they have ice hockey down south It's not the same.

433
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,062
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

434
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:56,858
Speaker 1: It's not real ice hockey Of course what we had it's like.

435
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:59,490
Speaker 0: it's like when you know, if we tried to play cricket, it just wouldn't be cricket.

436
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:02,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just be us hurting ourselves with that flat bat.

437
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, the wicked googly.

438
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:04,627
Speaker 1: That's right.

439
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:09,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure we have a listener now who's like in Britain or something.

440
00:28:09,506 --> 00:28:10,410
Speaker 0: It was all about cricket.

441
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:14,542
Speaker 1: Actually a lot of people at IBM played cricket.

442
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:17,330
Speaker 1: And in fact, I got hit with a goddamn cricket ball.

443
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:19,248
Speaker 1: Well, I was trying to play volleyball one day.

444
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:20,936
Speaker 0: Were they from India?

445
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,064
Speaker 1: actually every one of them was yep.

446
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:25,736
Speaker 0: See in India crickets real big Yeah, and you know what?

447
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:25,998
Speaker 1: It was.

448
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:28,130
Speaker 1: I played a couple times with these guys.

449
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,856
Speaker 1: it was really fun.

450
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:36,570
Speaker 0: Slurpee Indian not the Obviously, yes Yes, the Native Americans were playing crickets and they might have been.

451
00:28:37,431 --> 00:28:39,439
Speaker 0: They might have picked it up at some point.

452
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,889
Speaker 0: But no, no, the Slurpee Indians are all about cricket.

453
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,073
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway

454
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:57,058
Speaker 1: now we're not really gonna go into the origins of how we got into hockey because suffice to say it's pretty much the Fact that I was born in Detroit Which is no and you know every like New York is the Big Apple and you know There's the Big Easy and all the names.

455
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:03,010
Speaker 1: first, you know cities the Sin City for Las Vegas Detroit in the Windy City Detroit is hockey town.

456
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,250
Speaker 0: It's I thought it was the Motor City or motel.

457
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,031
Speaker 1: Yeah It's most.

458
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:14,556
Speaker 1: the thing is it's called hockey town by most of the natives and in effect in all the NHL stuff, too They always call it hockey town.

459
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,270
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Detroit takes hockey.

460
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,943
Speaker 0: Seriously, you know if you're in Detroit, I mean look at the other teams.

461
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:21,827
Speaker 0: They have to go on.

462
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:27,806
Speaker 1: they've got All right, I was gonna say other than the Lions the Tigers did pretty well this year.

463
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,150
Speaker 0: this year but not usually.

464
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:30,898
Speaker 0: They're not known for being great.

465
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:36,770
Speaker 0: They were great a long time Yeah, but I mean they're not like, you know a team that wins a lot there.

466
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,255
Speaker 0: They just happen to be good this year.

467
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:38,858
Speaker 0: They might know.

468
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:43,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Pistons have had a long run of being very good Yeah, but no one cares about that.

469
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:44,710
Speaker 0: At least we don't care about Yeah.

470
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,624
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is in hockey people care more about hockey than they do about all the other sports combined.

471
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:52,152
Speaker 1: hockey is so big in Detroit.

472
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,758
Speaker 1: you might as well be in Canada.

473
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:54,239
Speaker 1: Yep.

474
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:55,945
Speaker 0: Well, it's pretty close to Canada.

475
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:57,170
Speaker 0: So I think that has a lot to do with it.

476
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,412
Speaker 0: Yeah,

477
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:05,023
Speaker 1: well when the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in 1997 1996 when I was a freshman in high school at the end of that

478
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:06,406
Speaker 0: was 96 95

479
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:17,790
Speaker 1: when they won the Stanley Cup for The first time in however long the entire it's like southeastern half of the state Completely shut down the next day for the biggest frickin parade that the city had ever had.

480
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:21,605
Speaker 0: When the Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 94, you know who hadn't?

481
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:27,670
Speaker 0: they hadn't won since 1940. so that was what 54 years they hadn't won the Stanley Cup and they won it.

482
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,123
Speaker 0: There was a parade in New York City and everyone was crazy.

483
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:31,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty much the same deal.

484
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:33,549
Speaker 1: I mean they gave us the day off school.

485
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:35,820
Speaker 0: I mean you don't see like they're being a parade.

486
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,470
Speaker 0: when the Yankees win the bit the World Series You know, but when the Rangers win the Stanley Cup goddamn parade.

487
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:44,443
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is when the Red Wings won it again the same deal.

488
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,588
Speaker 1: when they won it again same deal.

489
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,157
Speaker 1: That's the one thing about hockey, you know.

490
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:54,537
Speaker 1: to jump right into remain discussion when anything happens in hockey It's like baseball is kind of this generic.

491
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,380
Speaker 1: Whoo.

492
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,824
Speaker 1: Oh, we did this.

493
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:57,526
Speaker 1: Oh, look.

494
00:30:57,547 --> 00:30:58,489
Speaker 1: He's running to second base.

495
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,635
Speaker 1: Go go go go go.

496
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:00,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got a home run.

497
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,650
Speaker 1: Oh my god our basketball.

498
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,320
Speaker 1: It's two points two points two three two two two two.

499
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:09,630
Speaker 1: Oh god, he missed two two two two three.

500
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:14,289
Speaker 1: But hockey is nothing nothing Uh-huh, uh-huh.

501
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:21,610
Speaker 1: But when something happens when a Gore is gold when a guy gets hit the crowd just goes absolutely fucking nuts.

502
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:23,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of like football.

503
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:25,770
Speaker 0: football is sort of the same kind of mood.

504
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:33,010
Speaker 0: The only thing is that in football you basically have this nothing and then a play starts and then some maybe something happens.

505
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,141
Speaker 0: Maybe nothing happens, but then there's this nothing.

506
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:41,749
Speaker 0: in between the plays, you know I mean, there's still the same excitement when there's touchdowns or huge tackles or interceptions or anything like that.

507
00:31:42,215 --> 00:31:43,110
Speaker 0: But there's all this time.

508
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,190
Speaker 0: It's basically like spikes and some spikes are bigger than others and it always returns to zero.

509
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:52,090
Speaker 0: Hockey is kind of like soccer and that it stays at like one all the time.

510
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,380
Speaker 1: There's this constant level of tension because at any moment someone could break away.

511
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,550
Speaker 1: Yeah any moment someone could fall down constantly playing hockey.

512
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,136
Speaker 0: They don't stop playing hockey.

513
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:04,110
Speaker 0: The puck is constantly in motion, you know, and they stop it as little as possible.

514
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:05,068
Speaker 0: They want to keep the game.

515
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:10,350
Speaker 0: Ideally a game of hockey will be three periods with no stoppages except for goals scored.

516
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:18,797
Speaker 1: Of course that never happened never happens, but because you go in the box for two minutes You have to sit in the box, of course, but you know, the puck is constantly in motion.

517
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:25,270
Speaker 0: You're constantly paying attention You're always at one and then you know, it rumbles and spikes all along the way.

518
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,287
Speaker 0: But the goals aren't so common like basketball that they're unexciting, you know.

519
00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:31,210
Speaker 0: and the hits?

520
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:35,773
Speaker 0: I mean there are hits all over the place, but the big hits are like, you know, they're there It's like doom.

521
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:41,478
Speaker 0: It's not like, you know football was a million hits at once and not one of them really gets noticed Except for the one that matters.

522
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:51,918
Speaker 1: I mean when a goal gets scored in hockey It's a lot like, you know, when you see other countries playing soccer or you know, football out there and when a goal is scored Yeah Real football, not American football.

523
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:58,846
Speaker 1: Everyone in the in the crowd in unison Screams as loud as they can and jump as high as they can and they don't stop for a while.

524
00:32:59,248 --> 00:32:59,810
Speaker 1: That's hockey.

525
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:09,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really, you know not only is it every sport even the sports that aren't fun to watch like NASCAR or Basketball are real fun to play.

526
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,770
Speaker 0: pretty much any sport is fun to play.

527
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:13,419
Speaker 0: I can't really think of a boring sport to play.

528
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:15,346
Speaker 1: Punch for punch is really kind of stupid.

529
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:20,713
Speaker 0: Okay, it's stupid But it's more fun than say watching Yeah, curling.

530
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,965
Speaker 1: I was about to bring up curling because curling is really fun.

531
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:25,330
Speaker 1: It's really fun.

532
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,601
Speaker 0: I mean shuffleboard is fun to play but to watch no good.

533
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:31,530
Speaker 0: Curling I imagine is very similar to shuffleboard on ice.

534
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,875
Speaker 0: So it's the same kind of thing.

535
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,421
Speaker 1: You know what I would rather watch than play?

536
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:35,966
Speaker 1: Outrunning Bears.

537
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:36,649
Speaker 0: Okay.

538
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:39,123
Speaker 1: Yeah I would rather watch that than play it.

539
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:40,410
Speaker 0: The bowl thing in Spain.

540
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,180
Speaker 0: I'd rather watch that and not participate.

541
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,950
Speaker 0: Although successfully participating that has to be hella fun.

542
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:52,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I get more adrenaline rushes from things that aren't quite as dangerous.

543
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd rather they should just replace all the bowls with hot naked chicks.

544
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,377
Speaker 0: That would be awesome.

545
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,469
Speaker 1: Anyway, here's some Benny Hill music.

546
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,341
Speaker 0: Okay, I found out that song's called Yakety Sax.

547
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:06,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't know that.

548
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,389
Speaker 0: I just learned that recently.

549
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:10,159
Speaker 1: I'm surprised you didn't know that.

550
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,385
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't know and now I do.

551
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:16,652
Speaker 0: and now if you're out there You now know that the Benny Hill song, you know It's called Yakety Sax.

552
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,598
Speaker 1: AKA the being chased around by naked women song.

553
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:20,159
Speaker 0: Exactly.

554
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,540
Speaker 0: All right.

555
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:27,235
Speaker 0: So hockey in addition to being fun to play is awesome to watch very awesome Especially if you get into it.

556
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:39,290
Speaker 1: Now my best advice here is that if you live anywhere Like I was saying before before we got sidetracked, especially in a college where there is local hockey It's usually like five bucks to go see non NHL hockey.

557
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,583
Speaker 1: You just go and see a game but don't go alone.

558
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:49,949
Speaker 1: get as many friends as you can Especially if you can find one person who's your friends with who knows about hockey you can explain what's going on.

559
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:56,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another thing about hockey is you know, a lot of people don't really understand Completely how it works.

560
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,530
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously they push the puck around and try to get it in the goal, you know.

561
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:07,004
Speaker 0: But not everyone understands like why that hit was okay And why that hit is a penalty or why did they just stop playing and have a face-off?

562
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:08,750
Speaker 1: or how come guys keep going in?

563
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,177
Speaker 1: out of the bench all the time just like during play and The best way.

564
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:23,897
Speaker 1: it's weird because when you watch like you can tell People who don't know about hockey or people who are new into hockey versus people who know about hockey at a game Because you'll see the people who you know Never been to a hockey game before.

565
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:24,702
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot about it.

566
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:28,159
Speaker 1: They always watch the puck They're just staring at wherever the puck is no matter what.

567
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:30,790
Speaker 1: they're just following the puck and you can watch their head track the puck.

568
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:39,350
Speaker 1: But people who watch hockey and know about it You'll see like something's going on with the puck, but they're looking down ice watching the setup for what's about to happen.

569
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:47,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's this flow to hockey and once once it clicks once you realize and one day you'll notice that wait a minute I'm not even looking at the puck.

570
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,888
Speaker 1: That's the date which you can fully appreciate the absolute brilliance.

571
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:52,590
Speaker 1: That is that sport.

572
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:58,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, the number one thing that you have to understand I think the first thing that you have to learn about watching hockey is the offsides rule.

573
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:10,247
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna teach you what the offsides rule is But pretty much like if you go to a hockey game and you see some guys You know the pucks floating around near that blue line and people are going oh or come on.

574
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:10,768
Speaker 0: Come on.

575
00:36:10,788 --> 00:36:13,902
Speaker 0: Come on Oh, you know and you're just sitting there going what?

576
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:15,590
Speaker 0: because it doesn't look like anything happened.

577
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,619
Speaker 0: And then the whistle blows and they have to have a face-off.

578
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:20,090
Speaker 0: That's offsides is happening pretty much.

579
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:24,115
Speaker 1: You can't go to the enemy team side To use the puck.

580
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:27,968
Speaker 0: the puck has to go over the blue line before a person goes over the blue line.

581
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:32,170
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah to put it put it as simply as simple as it's as far as I'm going.

582
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:33,670
Speaker 0: But yeah that you know.

583
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:34,949
Speaker 0: It's rules like that.

584
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:39,003
Speaker 0: Icing is another rule like that that you won't notice unless you know how hockey works.

585
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:44,246
Speaker 0: and if you don't know those rules You're not going to be able to really tell what the hell's going on.

586
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:47,190
Speaker 1: at the same time Don't try to read the rules to hockey.

587
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:47,953
Speaker 1: That's not gonna help.

588
00:36:47,993 --> 00:36:52,941
Speaker 1: just go to a hockey game with a friend who knows about hockey and when something happens You don't know what it was.

589
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:53,810
Speaker 0: Say why did that happen?

590
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,434
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

591
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:59,983
Speaker 1: if your friend actually knows about hockey They'll realize that you don't know what's going on and I'll just say things throughout the game.

592
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:02,090
Speaker 0: Like if they're that kind of person.

593
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,037
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah I found that most hockey people are that way.

594
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,028
Speaker 1: go to any hockey game and half the people in the crowd are going.

595
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:15,726
Speaker 0: they'll just Say under their breath whenever something happens like I interference offsides or when something's about to happen They'll be like ice ice ice ice ice.

596
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:26,610
Speaker 1: Yeah Yep And even then just the best way if you want to see why we like hockey so much Especially if you ever get to go to a hockey game with us Is that you'll see us sitting there and we won't say anything.

597
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,527
Speaker 1: But we'll slowly start edging forward and standing up and we our fists start clenching and start rising.

598
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:35,905
Speaker 1: then they go back down Rise go back down and the tension just builds and builds and builds.

599
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:36,850
Speaker 1: It's almost sexual.

600
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:48,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz like you can tell when you know, if someone knows hockey they can tell when like a big play is gonna be set up, you know, it's like I can tell just looking at the way guys are arranged and where the puck is like.

601
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:57,110
Speaker 0: There's a goal opportunity right there and in like five seconds later You will be either a goal or really close to a goal, you know, you know, see it way ahead.

602
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,542
Speaker 1: There's the same thing in football cuz like you see the formations you go.

603
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:01,250
Speaker 1: Oh, they're gonna try this kind of pass.

604
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,799
Speaker 1: They're gonna try to do this But there's always that stop or you sit and look at it.

605
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:06,966
Speaker 1: hockey is just fluid and it keeps going.

606
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,733
Speaker 1: the situation is changing Every second.

607
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:09,034
Speaker 1: Yep.

608
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:19,710
Speaker 0: Alright, let's let's just do some hockey anecdotes cuz I got a few here Because I think that as by example is a great way to show people, you know, how hockey can be awesome.

609
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:23,482
Speaker 1: Oh, I got I'm trying to think I got so many hockey stars.

610
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:25,770
Speaker 0: I got I got a few or three prepared.

611
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:27,077
Speaker 1: All right, you gonna pull one out?

612
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:29,289
Speaker 0: Yeah at first I want to tell everyone about Dennis Potvin.

613
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,953
Speaker 1: Potvin sucks.

614
00:38:31,073 --> 00:38:31,314
Speaker 1: Yeah.

615
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:48,993
Speaker 0: Well Dennis Potvin was a guy who played for the New York Islanders who play at the shitty Crap hole Nassau Coliseum, which is like the worst arena ever, but He played for the Islanders like in the 60s and such now the 60.

616
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,944
Speaker 0: Oh, no, he actually played in the 70s and 80s.

617
00:38:50,984 --> 00:39:02,041
Speaker 0: But anyway In 79 he was playing in a game against the Rangers the New York Rangers who play in Madison Square Garden a very nice arena and you know where the good teams play.

618
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:09,089
Speaker 0: and He he hit this guy named Olf Nelson and he broke his ankle.

619
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:19,012
Speaker 0: and You know, the Islanders would always chant, you know 1940 because the Rangers hadn't won since 1940.

620
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:24,769
Speaker 0: Well that night after Potvin broke this guy's ankle all the Rangers fans started going.

621
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:29,709
Speaker 0: Potvin sucks Potvin sucks, you know yelling at this guy.

622
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,762
Speaker 0: well the That chant, you know about Potvin second cuz.

623
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:37,170
Speaker 0: Potvin was an asshole and no one liked Dennis Potvin.

624
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,980
Speaker 0: He's you know, he's in the Hall of Fame.

625
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,704
Speaker 0: He's a great player.

626
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:46,989
Speaker 0: But no, he's an asshole and You know, they they kept doing this chant, you know, the Islanders would come to play and they would say Potvin sucks.

627
00:39:47,109 --> 00:40:01,050
Speaker 0: and to this day, even though Dennis Potvin has retired and Even if the New York Rangers are not playing against the Islanders They might be playing against like the LA Kings if there are they even still a team.

628
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:02,697
Speaker 0: I don't think there's still a team though.

629
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,022
Speaker 1: I don't know.

630
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:04,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think so.

631
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:05,830
Speaker 0: I don't think so either.

632
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:16,579
Speaker 0: they're playing against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim right and you'll go to Madison Square Garden for arrangers versus Anaheim and you will hear someone in the You know the crowd of mad square garden.

633
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,589
Speaker 0: go like, you know, dude, dude, dude, dude.

634
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:28,765
Speaker 0: And then everyone will say Potvin sucks Even though he's retired and they're not playing.

635
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:29,670
Speaker 0: the Islanders now.

636
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:39,119
Speaker 1: See that is another aspect of hockey that you see more like you can experience more directly at local games and college games But even in the NHL it's there is that like soccer ball football.

637
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,210
Speaker 1: The game is highly ritualized among the fans and often hilarious.

638
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:51,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like a tradition when it comes to hockey, you know, you go to like a baseball game Like if you go to see a Mets game, I just using the teams that are my teams because I've been to the games.

639
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be talking mostly about the Red Wings.

640
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:55,092
Speaker 0: Yeah hockey You know.

641
00:40:55,494 --> 00:41:05,250
Speaker 0: people say, you know, let's go Mets which is the thing that the giant scoreboard tells you to say, you know It's there, you know, there's some tradition there, but it's not really expressed.

642
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:12,258
Speaker 1: You won't notice it unless you know where to look and you're you know, like our God RIT the Red Wings whenever You know, they're getting close to a Stanley Cup.

643
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:13,444
Speaker 1: The whole thing is they'll play.

644
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:15,647
Speaker 1: I want Stanley.

645
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:25,708
Speaker 1: I Want Stanley and the whole octopus thing is still alive and strong in Detroit At least the last time I was going to games there.

646
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:31,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like in hockey if you score three goals in one game one player scores three goals in one game.

647
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,003
Speaker 0: That's a hat trick and people throw hats on the ice.

648
00:41:33,144 --> 00:41:34,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, you throw your hat in the air.

649
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,155
Speaker 1: That's just that's expected.

650
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:38,410
Speaker 0: They throw hats on the ice, you know, it's like a bunch of hats show up on the ice.

651
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,237
Speaker 0: Just there they are.

652
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:40,689
Speaker 1: I never threw my head on the ice.

653
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,465
Speaker 0: I never threw my hat on the ice because my hat was always too nice to get rid of.

654
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:43,948
Speaker 0: but I was sure.

655
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:49,872
Speaker 0: but if I Had a cheap hat like like a dollar sombrero from the store or like a plastic hat from a bar mitzvah away It went.

656
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:58,150
Speaker 1: you know now if you go to more local hockey games There's a lot more of that and we have many anecdotes from RIT.

657
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,789
Speaker 1: We'll try to do a whole separate show about RIT hockey.

658
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:07,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know local teams like if they don't already have a tradition they try to create a tradition, you know It's like.

659
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:09,399
Speaker 0: is that's what hockey is all about?

660
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,343
Speaker 0: is that sort of thing?

661
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:13,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in terms of tradition Rivalries between teams.

662
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:20,110
Speaker 1: like in football a rivalry lasts like, you know a couple of seasons maybe or there'll be like a kind of ride.

663
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like ooh, they played the Super Bowl against each other last year.

664
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,064
Speaker 0: We're gonna make the Monday the first Monday Night Football game of next year.

665
00:42:26,104 --> 00:42:27,190
Speaker 0: is those two teams hockey?

666
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:33,067
Speaker 1: There'll be things like you fuckers caught us out of the Stanley Cup in 1906.

667
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:33,930
Speaker 1: We're coming back.

668
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:45,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like one of your guys and your team injured one of our guys in 1937. we still hate you even though none of no one involved with either of those teams is alive.

669
00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:47,195
Speaker 0: They don't care.

670
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,160
Speaker 0: They still hate each other.

671
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:49,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's always a good-natured hate.

672
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:58,450
Speaker 1: I mean, like I said yesterday watch any hockey fight and Usually you'll see the two guys who fought just talking to each other after the fight like that was great.

673
00:42:58,854 --> 00:43:00,069
Speaker 1: We had a fight that was awesome.

674
00:43:00,238 --> 00:43:12,955
Speaker 0: Yeah the amount if you actually counted like the real fights the fights where people are trying to hurt each other in hockey and Compared it to the number of fights in other sports in which pretty much any fight in another sport is a guy trying to hurt Another guy for real.

675
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:13,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, most fights.

676
00:43:13,598 --> 00:43:16,049
Speaker 0: You will see that hockey actually has less real fights.

677
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:30,330
Speaker 1: fights are either totally consensual or they're part of this tit-for-tat where like a red-wing will check the Claude Lemieux because Claude Lemieux hurt a Guy on the Islanders the week before and that was payback because he didn't get paid back in that game.

678
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:31,698
Speaker 0: Something crazy like.

679
00:43:31,718 --> 00:43:32,140
Speaker 0: like hockey.

680
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,392
Speaker 1: teams look out for each other too If someone does something really bad, even if they get away with it the other teams take note Mm-hmm.

681
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:43,790
Speaker 1: I mean Claude Lemieux got clobbered by pretty much every team in the league for a while.

682
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:48,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the other thing is like remember the NHL strike was two years ago, right?

683
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:52,850
Speaker 0: All those players, you know you go to other sports and those guys are in it for the money.

684
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,370
Speaker 0: You have guys on football teams who are holding out on their contracts.

685
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,400
Speaker 0: They're refusing to play football because they think they'll get more money.

686
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:01,166
Speaker 0: Hockey players are crazy.

687
00:44:01,246 --> 00:44:02,430
Speaker 0: All they care about is playing hockey.

688
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,522
Speaker 0: You don't give a shit about money.

689
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:11,374
Speaker 0: during the strike They all join like minor leagues or other leagues or the 80 and during the strike most hockey players ran away to Europe because they Wanted to play hockey.

690
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:12,057
Speaker 0: They didn't care.

691
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:13,122
Speaker 1: They just wanted to play hockey.

692
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:14,850
Speaker 1: people play hockey because they love it.

693
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:18,610
Speaker 1: No one plays hockey for the money because you make more money in other sports.

694
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:25,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean when guys play on like the Olympic team in hockey, you're like, hey, you know These guys are in the middle of a hockey season.

695
00:44:25,338 --> 00:44:27,969
Speaker 0: there does a break because there's Olympic hockey going on.

696
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:36,649
Speaker 0: Why would these guys try very hard in the Olympics, you know, why would they risk getting injured for you know When there's a real NHL season going on?

697
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,750
Speaker 0: Yeah Because they're crazy hockey players.

698
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:45,330
Speaker 1: You think the New York Yankees would let their star pitcher just pitch in the minor leagues for fun in the middle of a season.

699
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:48,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, like go to the if there are a baseball Olympics.

700
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:49,589
Speaker 0: Do you think they just let him go?

701
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,590
Speaker 0: You know, there's a break so they're not missing any games, you know.

702
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,910
Speaker 0: But do you think they'd let him go pitch in some games that don't matter in terms of the World Series?

703
00:44:57,971 --> 00:44:59,989
Speaker 0: They matter for some gold medals and something else.

704
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:08,430
Speaker 1: I mean if the NHL disbanded there would be just as much hockey Nothing would change and all of those players would just join other leagues and continue playing even if they didn't make any money.

705
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:25,290
Speaker 0: Yeah That that's part of why hockey is there because anyone playing hockey Wants to play hockey real bad and they're trying as hard as they can and they care about the game They're playing and they're not there for some other reason, you know, it's not what it is their job But they're not doing it like it's their job.

706
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:31,458
Speaker 0: They're doing it, you know the same way that I would play a German board game Or that you would play a video game.

707
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,095
Speaker 1: now, I guess cuz we got to wrap this up, you know It's Thursday, and I'm tired.

708
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:36,701
Speaker 1: We got a concert tomorrow to go to.

709
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:41,358
Speaker 1: we'll talk about that at length on Monday Mm-hmm, but suffice to say hockey.

710
00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:44,910
Speaker 1: I mean most of our friends at RIT were not sports fans at all.

711
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:46,174
Speaker 0: No, they were not.

712
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,190
Speaker 1: we systematically dragged everyone we knew to RIT hockey games.

713
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:55,638
Speaker 0: Well, I think RIT hockey the fact that RIT hockey was slightly Enthusiastic and good helped a bit.

714
00:45:55,899 --> 00:45:57,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was normal hockey.

715
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:57,930
Speaker 0: They wouldn't have been into it.

716
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:05,481
Speaker 1: but even though I mean the fact that we dragged these people who generally hated sports to these games and By the end of a couple games, they'd be coming to us.

717
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:07,228
Speaker 1: Like we're going to the hockey game, right?

718
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:11,724
Speaker 1: No, I mean our senior year even started going to the girls hockey games.

719
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:13,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, we went to like two or three of those.

720
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:20,149
Speaker 1: They're well, the thing is the one thing that bothers me about hockey is that girls hockey really sucks, but it's not the girls fault.

721
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:23,659
Speaker 1: Yeah rules for women's hockey are different.

722
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,443
Speaker 1: they're not allowed to fight they're not allowed to check each other Which is hitting basically.

723
00:46:29,464 --> 00:46:37,821
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah Generally if you look at hockey the only real difference between like kids hockey Women's hockey minor league hockey and NHL.

724
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,668
Speaker 0: real hockey is the speed.

725
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:48,370
Speaker 0: Yes I mean if you go to a college hockey game It looks just like an NHL hockey game only in a smaller ice rink where everyone's skating slower.

726
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:54,450
Speaker 0: NHL hockey is exactly the same they the same setups and everything only they're going real fast.

727
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:59,369
Speaker 0: There's a lot more ice real fast and the pucks going faster and shot harder and everything like that.

728
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:01,109
Speaker 0: That's really the only difference.

729
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:11,170
Speaker 1: Well that and you'll see a lot cleaner plays like our in college hockey even in good college hockey You'll see a lot of you know passes that don't quite go or formations that just fail.

730
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,770
Speaker 0: But but a lot of that is you know things require the more speed to work properly.

731
00:47:16,151 --> 00:47:21,813
Speaker 0: There is of course the lack of you know technique because you're just a college kid and you haven't played hockey for four more years Necessary.

732
00:47:22,837 --> 00:47:28,710
Speaker 1: and I guess because there's one other aspect real briefly because we got to wrap this up But we talked a bit about f1 which we're kind of fans of too.

733
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:37,589
Speaker 1: it's got more so than me, but I enjoy it and we talked about you know, the technology and how tiny changes like a 16th of a degree on a fin completely changes the car.

734
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:39,487
Speaker 1: Hockey is the same way.

735
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:52,630
Speaker 1: tweaking the rules like in any direction totally changes the game and this year This is just as an example They have allowed you to have a slightly more curved blade on your hockey stick.

736
00:47:53,052 --> 00:47:55,208
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's like the tiniest little difference.

737
00:47:55,228 --> 00:48:05,825
Speaker 1: and Good God, is that going to change the game and make it more offensive make shooting bigger and more accurate Make the goalie's job harder and make the game in my opinion more awesome.

738
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:07,070
Speaker 0: It's gonna be very awesome.

739
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,178
Speaker 0: We're gonna shooting harder passing faster.

740
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:10,824
Speaker 0: They can be able to you know, prevent.

741
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:12,290
Speaker 0: they're gonna handle the puck better.

742
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:14,095
Speaker 1: It'll weaken the trap.

743
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:16,523
Speaker 1: now we're just talking in total hockey lingo.

744
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna weaken the trap kind of team.

745
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,060
Speaker 1: So teams like the Jersey Devils are pretty much fucked.

746
00:48:21,361 --> 00:48:22,767
Speaker 0: I don't know if they still play that way.

747
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:23,370
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

748
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,925
Speaker 1: I haven't actually watched because I don't watch TV.

749
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,493
Speaker 1: So I saw.

750
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:31,790
Speaker 1: I watched the Jersey Devils, you know before the strike and unless they've changed they they really have no chance.

751
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:32,184
Speaker 0: Yeah.

752
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,979
Speaker 0: But anyway, oh one last thing I want to say.

753
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,270
Speaker 0: my thing of the day from Monday was Ty Domi.

754
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:40,481
Speaker 0: You know punching Olaf Samuelson in the face and knocking him out.

755
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:42,810
Speaker 0: on Tuesday Ty Domi retired.

756
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:44,315
Speaker 0: Kind of a coincidence.

757
00:48:44,736 --> 00:48:45,599
Speaker 1: better call Randy.

758
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:48,309
Speaker 0: I know really I mean I use him in a thing of the day.

759
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:49,252
Speaker 0: the next day He retires.

760
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:53,468
Speaker 0: He must have listened to the show and then said up people are talking about me on some geek show.

761
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:53,930
Speaker 0: I better quit.

762
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:56,574
Speaker 1: They're on to me.

763
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:59,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in closing hockey's awesome.

764
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:02,357
Speaker 1: We front row crew comm join the forums.

765
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:03,260
Speaker 1: They're crazy.

766
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,790
Speaker 0: And if you're an RIT student, you know, there should be hockey.

767
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:10,463
Speaker 0: You should go to the home hockey games as many as you can though.

768
00:49:10,503 --> 00:49:12,611
Speaker 1: They're not as great as they used to be They're not.

769
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:13,013
Speaker 0: they used to.

770
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:18,878
Speaker 0: the only difference is they used to win all the time and now they don't really win all the time Because they move to Division one.

771
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,165
Speaker 1: now when we say win all the time.

772
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:22,773
Speaker 1: We mean win all The time.

773
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:31,990
Speaker 0: yeah, if just go to one of their games and look at the ceiling and you will see all the little championship banners They they don't just give you those, you know to make your arena look nice.

774
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:41,870
Speaker 1: Yeah art now that if you needed any other endorsement of hockey RIT in my opinion probably the geekiest University in the nation of the United States.

775
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:50,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely I mean MIT and you know and Caltech are really geeky But I think overall RIT has the highest concentration and the greater number of geeks.

776
00:49:51,191 --> 00:50:00,189
Speaker 0: I think that the only data you need to support that claim is the fact that it is the most piracy of Yeah How many times did like the FBI?

777
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,313
Speaker 0: Customs that came.

778
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:03,516
Speaker 0: it's crazy.

779
00:50:03,657 --> 00:50:06,624
Speaker 1: FBI came at least once anyway, I mean I worked for ITS.

780
00:50:06,665 --> 00:50:07,326
Speaker 1: I saw some shit.

781
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,747
Speaker 0: Yeah.

782
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:14,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, but hockey was so Unbelievably popular at RIT.

783
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:18,910
Speaker 1: I mean more people went to hockey games than went to pretty much any other sport that RIT combined.

784
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:23,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, and when they played the rivals the game would sell out even though the school was full of geeks.

785
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:30,330
Speaker 0: I mean people would walk through the snow in the cold and that's part of why hockey was important there because it was cold.

786
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,310
Speaker 0: That's the sport you could play in this place and the school had its own ice rink, which is kind of huge.

787
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:42,861
Speaker 0: Also the peep nerds who normally spent all day inside playing counter-strike would turn off Counter-strike or at least pause it.

788
00:50:43,002 --> 00:50:45,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, they go to the Disconnect from the server.

789
00:50:45,882 --> 00:50:46,970
Speaker 0: leave it running, you know?

790
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:56,390
Speaker 0: Walk out in the snow in the cold in the winter to pay five bucks To sit on a cold bench in an ice rink to watch some college.

791
00:50:56,771 --> 00:51:00,701
Speaker 0: You know bums play ice hockey to watch some hotel management majors.

792
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:03,950
Speaker 1: Yeah hotel management majors from connect Canada.

793
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:05,093
Speaker 1: I almost said Canadian.

794
00:51:05,193 --> 00:51:09,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, all of RIT's hockey players were hotel management majors from Canada.

795
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:11,168
Speaker 1: Yeah fancy that.

796
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:13,662
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, oh most of them were.

797
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:14,790
Speaker 0: some of them were real majors.

798
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:19,187
Speaker 0: One guy was like a painter right and he painted a like a picture of hockey and they sold.

799
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:19,950
Speaker 0: they auctioned it off.

800
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:24,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh god I just remember we got stories about RIT hockey players that live next door to us in colony.

801
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:26,054
Speaker 0: We have lots of stories about.

802
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:28,382
Speaker 1: alright, we're gonna do an RIT hockey episode in the future.

803
00:51:28,403 --> 00:51:41,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll leave it at that Mm-hmm, and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
