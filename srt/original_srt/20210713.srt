Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about collecting in games and probably not the kind of collecting you're thinking about.

5
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:24,708
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:25,753
Speaker 1: Moderately.

00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:30,409
Speaker 1: sad weekend Emily and I had to travel back out to Leroy for death in the family.

8
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:32,276
Speaker 1: Her uncle passed away sadly.

9
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:35,810
Speaker 1: I'll post a link to the obituary just to spread the little bit of his life.

10
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:40,479
Speaker 1: That is interesting to strangers But I was surprised that you were surprised.

11
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,930
Speaker 0: you went so soon because you know, they weren't Jewish, right?

12
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:44,630
Speaker 1: So well, we didn't go out for the funeral.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:53,328
Speaker 1: we went out just to be with the family and help everyone sort of get through it because it was it was sudden and Pretty much unexpected like this was a situation like that.

14
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:57,070
Speaker 1: But I'm not gonna depress you with all the details here.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,016
Speaker 1: You can just y'all thought link to the obituary.

16
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,286
Speaker 1: but on the way there as you know, we have a car.

17
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:03,370
Speaker 1: It's an old car.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,503
Speaker 1: It's like an old Chevy Cruze and that's the best way.

19
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:12,497
Speaker 1: and kovat even in these sort of waning kovat times Hopefully waiting to get out to a now.

20
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,384
Speaker 0: No now they're waxing in some placing right now.

21
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:16,828
Speaker 0: So it's a New York.

22
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:17,470
Speaker 0: It is waxing.

23
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,795
Speaker 1: It's it's well depends.

24
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:22,805
Speaker 1: It's waxing in some neighborhoods and continuing to wane in other neighborhoods.

25
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:23,949
Speaker 1: I've read the recent data.

26
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,403
Speaker 0: Well, the graph is going up.

27
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:27,087
Speaker 0: That's not good.

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,926
Speaker 1: I'm still avoiding things like flying or mastering like big mass transit if I can.

29
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:41,341
Speaker 1: so we drove out there And I did recently because it's an old car go to the local pep boys because they were the only place anywhere nearby that'll take online appointments.

30
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:50,790
Speaker 1: and like I could do everything about talking to a human and I got a brake job had him replace the front rotors, you know car crap the kind of stuff I haven't had to deal with in a long time.

31
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:57,777
Speaker 0: So good not having a car.

32
00:01:57,797 --> 00:01:59,763
Speaker 0: so good so good when a car doesn't have you right.

33
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:07,210
Speaker 1: Oh, I had what Josh Newman actually was tweeting about the car game recently.

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,794
Speaker 1: But we're on.

35
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:09,758
Speaker 1: cars is escalating.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,989
Speaker 1: So I got his brake job and This is gonna be the first big trip of taken since I got the brake job and we're driving And the brakes go the brakes cut out.

37
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:26,618
Speaker 1: Ah, so as soon as we are in the middle of fuck-all-nowhere, Pennsylvania Cuz we're taking the angle way up instead of the like through.

38
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:31,076
Speaker 1: well the angle way because the angle way saves like 45 minutes of driving But a little bit.

39
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,489
Speaker 1: yeah, it goes through like Scranton and like middle-of-nowhere.

40
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,366
Speaker 0: Check you don't get all those rest stops and whatnot.

41
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:39,502
Speaker 0: if you go the angle Yeah, something like huh check engine you miss some tolls.

42
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,049
Speaker 0: going the angle way is less told it is.

43
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:48,309
Speaker 1: So check engine light like nothing's wrong with the car like I saw I feel like okay coming up like next time I stopped to get gas.

44
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,930
Speaker 1: I'm gonna check out this check engine light and deal with it later Because in RIT I drove a car with the check engine light for like three years because I couldn't afford even check.

45
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:02,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz well cuz check engine light, you know, it could be in without connecting the computer thing You know to get the actual readout, right?

46
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:04,313
Speaker 0: It's like it could be fucking anything They don't see have.

47
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:09,658
Speaker 0: all errors are hooked up to one light and it's just like error And there's only two states of that light in most cars.

48
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:22,543
Speaker 1: if it turns on it means anything and if it flashes it Which almost no one has ever something bad flashing means turn the car off right now Like pull over immediately and maybe exit the vehicle.

49
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:22,884
Speaker 1: It might.

50
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,530
Speaker 0: I've never seen that in my life ever.

51
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,473
Speaker 1: I saw it once.

52
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:30,370
Speaker 1: you know what I saw it on a car where the engine had just exploded.

53
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:35,210
Speaker 1: Literally, I started the car the engine exploded like the hood dented and everything.

54
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:38,781
Speaker 1: And then the check-in engine light just started flashing and I was like, thanks.

55
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:39,764
Speaker 1: Thanks for that.

56
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:39,945
Speaker 0: Yeah.

57
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:40,266
Speaker 0: Thanks.

58
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:41,430
Speaker 0: There's no engine anymore.

59
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:42,936
Speaker 0: I'll check that engine.

60
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:44,341
Speaker 0: So, uh, none of it.

61
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:50,470
Speaker 1: I'm not too long Later, this car starts are running a little rough like shuttering.

62
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:56,517
Speaker 1: So now I'm like well so pull off immediately the next exit and We pull into the first mechanic.

63
00:03:56,557 --> 00:04:02,622
Speaker 1: we could find cuz I got to get her to a mechanic because I don't want to turn it Off and we get to a mechanic and stop the car.

64
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,713
Speaker 1: I get out and the guys like oh we're full up I'm going done for the day.

65
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,590
Speaker 1: So I'm like, yeah, so I open the hood and he starts looking at the hood like looking inside.

66
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,788
Speaker 1: He's like, how'd you check your oil?

67
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,808
Speaker 1: Looks I see a little smoke.

68
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:25,031
Speaker 1: Maybe something's going on and the whole time he's talking I can see very clearly That smoke is coming off of the left front caliper on the brakes Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:34,822
Speaker 1: long story short the brakes burn themselves out because they that brake just seized Full on while we were driving but because the cigar was going fast enough.

70
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:43,330
Speaker 1: The engine just overpowered it and Just ran the brake seized until eventually it overheated and broke completely.

71
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:49,110
Speaker 1: I go to the next mechanic who's open who normally doesn't work on you American cars.

72
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,838
Speaker 1: It's like this guy who only focuses.

73
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,164
Speaker 1: it's like a euro sports plays.

74
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen those ones.

75
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:55,254
Speaker 1: But the guy's like oh god I'll help you out.

76
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:58,150
Speaker 1: and he looks at the brake and he's like whoever did your brakes?

77
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,862
Speaker 1: Fucked him up like baby's first brake job.

78
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,830
Speaker 1: So, uh, he fixed it for me.

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,730
Speaker 0: So you get her going as we get for going up head boy.

80
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,135
Speaker 1: Yeah didn't even charge me that much.

81
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:14,010
Speaker 1: but he was like he gave me the rotor and he was like Drop this on the desk of whoever you're gonna go sue over that.

82
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:23,790
Speaker 0: They pay for the new brake job I got and my end is usually all service, you know has like a warranty.

83
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,409
Speaker 0: So you're just gonna get the warrant apply for the warranty for the service and they give you the money back that you spent on.

84
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,407
Speaker 1: But the emergency repair I had to get to deal with this problem.

85
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:39,610
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that's probably included in the warranty on the service from the other, you know from the pet boys.

86
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,249
Speaker 0: You don't need to sue them unless they did not they don't want to you know.

87
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,056
Speaker 1: No, no, they all honor the warrant.

88
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:52,907
Speaker 0: if they if they honor the warranty and pay for all this then yeah I would say even if they do honor the warranty you just go to a small claim court.

89
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:53,610
Speaker 0: That's a small claim?

90
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,916
Speaker 1: Oh, that's definitely a small claim.

91
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:56,725
Speaker 0: That's just like a textbook small claim.

92
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,654
Speaker 0: and you walk in there You just plop the.

93
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:02,130
Speaker 0: do you plop the rotor down in the judge's desk be like, so here's where the story gets interesting.

94
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:06,148
Speaker 1: That check engine light was unrelated to this problem.

95
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:10,930
Speaker 1: So he clears the codes and he's like, oh yeah, it's like a p290 like under boost.

96
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:12,974
Speaker 1: He's like, it's not a problem.

97
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,639
Speaker 1: So I cleared it and he started again.

98
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:17,690
Speaker 1: It didn't come back, but that didn't make any sense.

99
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,075
Speaker 1: There's no turbo in that car.

100
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:22,850
Speaker 1: What the fuck does under boost mean for a car without a turbo or a super?

101
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,990
Speaker 0: Maybe they messed with your computer at the pet boys.

102
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:29,704
Speaker 1: Uh, maybe cuz that pet boys remember was the place where the fart car conversation was happening.

103
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:34,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, so These cut the air check engine light comes on.

104
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:40,870
Speaker 1: so now I'm in a town so like a couple days later I just go to like a local Auto Zone because they have pretty much any place.

105
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,946
Speaker 1: We'll read those codes and tell you what this is.

106
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:47,190
Speaker 0: your problem is You're always going to like, you know these, you know, notice how you went to a pet boy, right?

107
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,085
Speaker 0: Not good Then you went to just some guy out in the middle of nowhere and it was good right.

108
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,499
Speaker 0: then now you're going to an auto zone.

109
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:52,869
Speaker 0: lesson.

110
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:57,549
Speaker 0: Go always go to just some shady guy for the car biz.

111
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,675
Speaker 0: don't Brand places.

112
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,090
Speaker 1: you only go to an auto zone to get him to pull the codes.

113
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,833
Speaker 0: That's like going it.

114
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,821
Speaker 0: would you go to Best Buy for computer biz?

115
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,010
Speaker 0: No, so you shouldn't be going to Auto Zone, right?

116
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:07,613
Speaker 0: You got.

117
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:16,530
Speaker 1: if you go to go to some guy Problem is some guy is so when we got to the Eurosport place I was because he was like, oh, I don't normally work at cars.

118
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,604
Speaker 1: I was like, oh is there anyone else within like I don't know 50 miles that you would recommend?

119
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:25,488
Speaker 1: and he says no every mechanic In within a hundred miles of this location is bullshit.

120
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to go to some guy who doesn't suck.

121
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:33,675
Speaker 0: it's not saying all the some guys are good I'm saying all the Nate the brand Wrong.

122
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,830
Speaker 1: I did not go to this Auto Zone to get car repairs.

123
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,645
Speaker 1: I went because they will pull the codes for free and tell me what they are.

124
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,328
Speaker 1: Give me a printout.

125
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:40,569
Speaker 1: That's it.

126
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:46,955
Speaker 1: I went there they pull the codes and it looks like the o2 sensors are just like Dying because it's.

127
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:52,469
Speaker 0: no that's the most cause like the most common thing 100% unrelated to the brakes caught fire.

128
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,708
Speaker 0: Yep.

129
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,109
Speaker 1: So yeah, that was my car adventures.

130
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,979
Speaker 0: Okay, that's I'm glad not to have a car.

131
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,310
Speaker 0: my I got a story that's also car related.

132
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,529
Speaker 0: I was not I was not in the car.

133
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:10,283
Speaker 1: I'm excited about this because this is one of those races where you all you said before the show was This would have been a situation where rim being around would have been useful.

134
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:11,930
Speaker 0: It would have been very useful.

135
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:16,390
Speaker 0: So I'm biking yesterday in a city bike to the dentist, right?

136
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:28,530
Speaker 0: Well, I just made a dentist appointment now that it's time Delayed my previous dentist - until Yesterday, so I went yesterday to Manhattan, right?

137
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,539
Speaker 0: and I'm city biking over right and going down Crescent and Across across in the street little intersection and there's all the.

138
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,769
Speaker 0: it's pretty early in the morning cuz my dentist appointments at 10 a.m.

139
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:41,049
Speaker 0: So it's 9 something, you know.

140
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,389
Speaker 0: The cars are backed up trying to get on the bridge on Crescent like they are usually right

141
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:45,610
Speaker 1: now

142
00:08:46,831 --> 00:09:01,319
Speaker 0: And some car, you know comes in from the left side and he's you know, trying to you know, wedge himself into the You know to the to the line of traffic that is solid and barely moving And he turns a little too sharply, right?

143
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,690
Speaker 0: So like there's the bollards on the the bike lane, right?

144
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,116
Speaker 0: So he's a little like his.

145
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:08,430
Speaker 0: his left headlight is a little bit to the inside.

146
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:12,208
Speaker 0: So, you know, he's got a he's gonna have to back up a little bit right to get back into the.

147
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:30,570
Speaker 0: you know Around the other side, right, you know, and I'm like, okay, I just keep going and you know I'm on my way to the about like a block north of like, you know, the Queen's Plaza there And I look behind me and I see that that car Right rather than try to wedge into the traffic has decided you just slowly drive down the bike.

148
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:32,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could.

149
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:45,479
Speaker 1: I can see why cuz I'm the one who would be like pulling the license plate off the back Chasing banging on his head so not seeing anything around I just stop and turn my bike sideways.

150
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,582
Speaker 0: don't move bro.

151
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:47,926
Speaker 1: And it's a city bike.

152
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:48,588
Speaker 1: What's he gonna do?

153
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:49,290
Speaker 1: destroy his car?

154
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:49,631
Speaker 0: I'm just.

155
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,401
Speaker 0: I'm just sitting there right.

156
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:52,850
Speaker 1: and there's those of you who don't live in New York.

157
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,998
Speaker 1: These city bikes are bike rentals like from docks.

158
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,804
Speaker 1: They weigh 55 pounds.

159
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:58,249
Speaker 1: They're made of solid steel.

160
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,277
Speaker 0: So I just I just stop.

161
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:01,121
Speaker 0: I'm like what am I gonna?

162
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:01,763
Speaker 0: I got nowhere to be.

163
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:03,370
Speaker 0: I got other the dentist, right?

164
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,303
Speaker 1: You know, that's that's a remove right there.

165
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,209
Speaker 1: That's like the pro move.

166
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,034
Speaker 1: Don't don't aggressively confront just.

167
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:10,581
Speaker 0: I didn't say I didn't even say anything.

168
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:13,048
Speaker 0: I just basically, you know, just sat there.

169
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:13,830
Speaker 0: I'm just.

170
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,970
Speaker 0: I'm just sitting there in the bike lane does not do with nothing, right?

171
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,590
Speaker 0: He starts yelling and cursing and threatening or whatever and I'm like, okay hit me and go to jail.

172
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,710
Speaker 0: It's it's like not my problem, right?

173
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,541
Speaker 1: See the only thing is you gotta be standing there holding.

174
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,306
Speaker 0: knock my teeth out.

175
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:29,010
Speaker 0: I'm going to the dentist.

176
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:31,869
Speaker 0: Anyway, you gotta be holding your phone like obviously recording him.

177
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:33,255
Speaker 0: I didn't I didn't.

178
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:41,530
Speaker 0: you know, I don't have the phone record instinct, but you know If the incident if the incident would have lasted longer then that would have come to that point.

179
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,110
Speaker 1: But it was less than like a minute long incident because I got that guy who tried to punch me to back off.

180
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,010
Speaker 1: I didn't even record him.

181
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:51,809
Speaker 1: I just held my phone up like I was recording him and I pretended I was calling the cops on speakerphone.

182
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,570
Speaker 1: That was anyway, I didn't do anything.

183
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,032
Speaker 0: No, I would.

184
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:57,650
Speaker 0: it would have gotten to that if I it had lasted more than a few more seconds, right?

185
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:01,947
Speaker 0: You know, it's like if the guy shoots me dead, it's like well, I guess that's how I die.

186
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:07,784
Speaker 0: Okay If he runs me over, okay, I guess that's good luck getting over that city bike to get to you.

187
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,489
Speaker 0: it's you know.

188
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:28,961
Speaker 0: He clearly was you know a person with a lot of anger issues and no regard for the law or other human beings But his car wasn't farting Although it definitely looked like a car that you know was was cared for like whoever's driving it cared about, you know The car being shiny or whatever, you know You know, it's just generic cursing coming out of him.

189
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,370
Speaker 0: You know, you know get out of the way and whatever.

190
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:42,689
Speaker 0: But yeah, I just don't move and after a few seconds he backs up a little bit right and I'm just like I'm just waiting for him to go back into the traffic, you know and give up and then I'll be on my way.

191
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:52,773
Speaker 0: He just goes right on the sidewalk Because then there's consequences for someone like that Maybe.

192
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:56,266
Speaker 0: but uh, you know, I couldn't exactly do anything about that.

193
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,523
Speaker 0: I'm just like well He just drives down.

194
00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,210
Speaker 0: they just got it.

195
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:06,268
Speaker 0: You know there was someone biking a city bike in the opposite like towards him and they could have blocked the sidewalk if they wanted to but They chose not to.

196
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,853
Speaker 0: Wasn't gonna be like?

197
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:10,761
Speaker 0: hey other random person had never met.

198
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,770
Speaker 0: I demand you also put your life at risk.

199
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,638
Speaker 1: But if I had been they fed him in me.

200
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:19,130
Speaker 1: come in the opposite direction, you know exactly you would have blocked that sidewalk.

201
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:20,517
Speaker 0: No, probably no hesitation.

202
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:23,210
Speaker 1: My phone would have somehow a bit in my hand before you even blinked.

203
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:30,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly anyway, but yeah, so he went down the sidewalk and got around me and that was that before I. you know if he would have it would have lasted a little longer.

204
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:42,170
Speaker 0: there would have been some phone action, but You know just went down the sidewalk and then rather than go into the traffic, you know He basically made a left and probably was gonna go down.

205
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,650
Speaker 0: You know make a right towards, you know Queens Plaza and then come at it from the other direction right the way the buses come.

206
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,056
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's like.

207
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:57,023
Speaker 0: okay, you know, I guess I can't stop you angry guy But there's been a lot of gas-powered vehicle incursions into bike lanes lately.

208
00:12:57,063 --> 00:13:04,401
Speaker 1: Queensboro like the Queens Bridge like 59th Street Bridge I see I get passed by multiple full-on motorcycles regularly like into work now.

209
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:06,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like the solution.

210
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:12,510
Speaker 0: right, you know I try to think like different solutions that aren't like, you know cops or anything, right?

211
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,673
Speaker 0: you know cuz it's like and You know, it's.

212
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:27,129
Speaker 0: this solution is also obviously very problematic in well extremely problematic But I kind of like it the best because all the solutions are problematic right ones that physically disable or block the car.

213
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:28,612
Speaker 0: No, no.

214
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:33,570
Speaker 0: No, I think what we should do is the rule should be that if you video it, right?

215
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,209
Speaker 0: So you prove that you're not just you know, do it, you know being you know a nut job, right?

216
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:53,858
Speaker 0: That if there's like a car in the bike lane or even just an illegally parked car Right and you have video proving that this car is illegally parked right and that they're breaking the law That you know tickets no courts.

217
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,402
Speaker 0: No, you don't need any of that shit.

218
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:59,433
Speaker 0: It's just legally open season on the car You can.

219
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,862
Speaker 1: I was I was waiting for the Scott moment in that idea.

220
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just legally open season.

221
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,403
Speaker 0: If you prove that, you know, this is really somebody who is misbehaving.

222
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,216
Speaker 0: It's like we don't need to ticket them We don't need to do any.

223
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,510
Speaker 0: no no bother with any of that stuff.

224
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,044
Speaker 0: Just you can smash and scratch the fuck out of that car with.

225
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,410
Speaker 0: you can't hurt me body, right?

226
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,421
Speaker 0: So you can't like smash the windshield that someone's in the car, right?

227
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:22,710
Speaker 0: But if there's no one in the car smash away.

228
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:26,590
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you want to steal the catalytic converter from the car and sell it.

229
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:28,514
Speaker 0: Go the right the fuck.

230
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:34,675
Speaker 1: imagine the ads like you submit the video and GPS and all that and then an attendant Gives you the go no-go on.

231
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:35,938
Speaker 1: Can you attack this vehicle?

232
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,522
Speaker 0: Yeah, right exactly.

233
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:40,550
Speaker 0: And you know what it's like that would actually achieve.

234
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:47,744
Speaker 0: Well, it would achieve the desired goal I think better than any of the other options which is people with cars would be.

235
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,730
Speaker 0: would not fuck around right?

236
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,230
Speaker 0: It's like a ticket doesn't scare you from stopping speeding or illegal parking, right?

237
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,690
Speaker 0: You know even getting you know arrested or license points like none of those things are actually a deterrent.

238
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,750
Speaker 0: All I'm picturing here is if it was legal to smash the fuck out of a car, right?

239
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:11,170
Speaker 0: You wouldn't have to worry about people smashing the fuck out of cars because nobody would park illegally even once.

240
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:15,443
Speaker 0: Right because there's be people with like, you know crowbars just wandering like.

241
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:16,647
Speaker 0: please please please please.

242
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:22,854
Speaker 0: I really want to smash I really want to get my Street Fighter 2 bonus stage Right and it's like.

243
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:32,780
Speaker 0: no you would not see a double parking for even one second because everyone with a car would be Terrified that that would be the end of their car And that would achieve it's like.

244
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,956
Speaker 0: you don't need to worry about the vigilante justice Aspect because it would never happen.

245
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:43,777
Speaker 0: you would get the deterrent effect that you really want which is every car obeys the law Perfectly at all times.

246
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:47,090
Speaker 0: Well, this is why you had a car if you were driving, right?

247
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,834
Speaker 0: And that was the.

248
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,789
Speaker 0: that was the case that there was truly open season on cars.

249
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:56,968
Speaker 0: Would you even dare to even like go past a stop sign for like, you know a little bit, right?

250
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:05,762
Speaker 1: Well, the only thing I would do not me but like the the I don't know the royal we the person who's out there The Cartman of the crowbar

251
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:06,609
Speaker 0: you'd be the crowbar guy

252
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:14,311
Speaker 1: There's the person who would steal someone else's car that they disliked and park it somewhere illegally and leave it That way.

253
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:18,329
Speaker 1: they don't get caught with a stolen car and a bunch of bystanders destroy that car.

254
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:22,303
Speaker 0: But if you see it stealing the car would still be the crime.

255
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:29,289
Speaker 0: I mean, that's still obviously the crime Getting caught getting caught stealing a car would still be the same consequences now.

256
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,829
Speaker 0: So nothing would change in terms of Grand Theft Auto, right?

257
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,509
Speaker 0: So I mean that after the Grand Theft Auto the car was disposed of.

258
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:44,302
Speaker 1: So anyway the purge of cars aside in the news we didn't do some.

259
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:44,643
Speaker 1: Tuesday.

260
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:48,314
Speaker 1: Tuesday's are the shows we missed least often But a bunch of stuff happens.

261
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,519
Speaker 0: They're the easiest to do.

262
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:53,133
Speaker 1: So, uh, there's a bunch of gaming news we didn't talk about.

263
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:57,829
Speaker 1: but instead of doing a gaming news roundup, we're just gonna talk about a couple things that are particularly notable.

264
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:09,979
Speaker 1: and the main thing I want to talk about is the announcement that advance Wars 1 and advance Wars 2 are getting a Reboot like remake on the Nintendo switch.

265
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:10,840
Speaker 0: Yes.

266
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:13,910
Speaker 0: These are the two GBA advance Wars's right?

267
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,030
Speaker 0: They're gonna combine them into a single game.

268
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:25,624
Speaker 0: You're gonna get it on your switch so you can be able to play at 1080p Portable, you know and you're in your dock or 720p portably confirmed.

269
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:33,270
Speaker 0: There is some amount of online play with presumably Nintendo online subscription required of some amount.

270
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:39,429
Speaker 0: I imagine it'll just be play the multiplayer mode with randos or friend codes or who knows what right now.

271
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,449
Speaker 1: Finally, I can prove how fucking amazing I am at these games.

272
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:46,806
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's just gonna be no at all indications.

273
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:54,270
Speaker 0: all the information We have sovara suggests is just gonna be advanced wars like nothing really other than the online play and the increased resolution and graphics.

274
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:59,568
Speaker 0: It's just gonna be those two games same missions same maps same everything.

275
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:05,377
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, well, the only thing I'm annoyed about is those two games and you don't want to you know Do the online part.

276
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,949
Speaker 0: you don't really need to buy this.

277
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:12,212
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm gonna buy it one because I want to review it and like go deep on it and see what else they do Do.

278
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:13,458
Speaker 1: I do want to play online.

279
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,321
Speaker 1: and three I do want to stream the hell out of these games And I'd rather to stream whatever's on the switch instead of like my.

280
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:23,405
Speaker 0: streaming from a switch is a lot easier than streaming from a GBA or GBA emulator.

281
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:24,512
Speaker 1: exactly I think.

282
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:30,110
Speaker 0: I think the the preferred way to stream from GBA is to get a GameCube with a Game Boy player underneath.

283
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:31,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, then use that.

284
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:34,460
Speaker 1: I do have a good Emulator that I use to stream DS games.

285
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,230
Speaker 1: That's what I've been using for advanced wars days of ruin.

286
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,158
Speaker 0: But that DS I have the DS emulator.

287
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,067
Speaker 0: It's like cuz you don't get the touchscreen biz, right?

288
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:40,750
Speaker 0: It's like it's not.

289
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,390
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's only good for advanced wars where you would never use a touchscreen.

290
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:46,579
Speaker 1: That's true, yeah, yeah, you know what.

291
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,770
Speaker 1: I have two ROMs advanced wars DS and advanced wars dr.

292
00:18:51,755 --> 00:19:00,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, but so yeah the notable part about this is one I talked I've talked a lot in the old days like if any only notable part is that Nintendo has not Forgotten that advanced wars exists.

293
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:04,038
Speaker 1: Yes, because advanced wars I would argue there are like.

294
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:07,050
Speaker 1: it is almost alone in a genre in terms of quality.

295
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:08,977
Speaker 1: No game that is like this.

296
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:12,550
Speaker 1: in terms of turn-based military units fighting on a grid.

297
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:26,208
Speaker 1: no game in the Nintendo ecosystem and arguably much of the rest of the world's ecosystem even comes close to the level of Polish of the game mechanics of advanced wars, especially advanced wars 2 and advanced wars.

298
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:26,790
Speaker 1: days of ruin.

299
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:34,110
Speaker 1: and The reason these games are so phenomenal in my opinion is the same reason chrono trigger was so phenomenal.

300
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,370
Speaker 1: It cost way too much to make them.

301
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,665
Speaker 1: It took way too many people way too much effort and there's no way to make money.

302
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:44,281
Speaker 0: making games like that anymore Was really caused that it was that hard.

303
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:44,642
Speaker 0: Yes.

304
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,250
Speaker 1: We talked about this on geek nights.

305
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:54,876
Speaker 1: There was even an article about it when they revealed how many people were involved in the level design of the advanced wars games Mm-hmm, how many hours they spent.

306
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,419
Speaker 1: I got dig up.

307
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,889
Speaker 1: we talked about this like seven eight years ago.

308
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:00,189
Speaker 0: Okay, that's why I don't remember.

309
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:08,818
Speaker 1: But the thing that's also interesting is that advanced wars days of ruin the last game the one I'm actually streaming is The most fair one.

310
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:09,684
Speaker 1: It's the fairest.

311
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:10,670
Speaker 1: It's the most balanced.

312
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:14,429
Speaker 1: It's the best like ortho game competition between humans.

313
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:22,880
Speaker 1: Advanced wars 1 & 2 are way more fun But they are not balanced.

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:39,662
Speaker 1: and the thing I'm really curious to see is if there is any Thought to how to balance the CEOs in online play or if they don't balance them Because you could just pick the overpowered CEOs and always win or everyone will play the same few S-tier CEOs and there's a lot of cheap nonsense.

315
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:42,336
Speaker 1: like the games are more about the puzzle I mean, that's not different.

316
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,630
Speaker 0: That's not any different from fighting games that aren't balanced.

317
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:47,870
Speaker 0: Right, you know, it's it's like if you're playing competitive advanced wars.

318
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,970
Speaker 0: They're either a going to be banning right Sturm or whoever Sturm and hot year the ones I think you'd have to ban.

319
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

320
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:56,280
Speaker 0: You're either putting in bands.

321
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,384
Speaker 1: Maybe let Mel play.

322
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,914
Speaker 1: This is not actually that good Right.

323
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:05,090
Speaker 0: or people are only playing the s-tier ones and the other ones aren't viable in competitive play.

324
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:10,010
Speaker 1: There's different leagues like there's the like main three CEOs only league or something.

325
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:16,450
Speaker 0: I think they're you know, just there's also the other option of Fox only final destination.

326
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:17,776
Speaker 0: No, CEO power, right?

327
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:22,234
Speaker 1: It's like just like advance, but that's kind of what days of ruin is Which is just.

328
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,468
Speaker 0: it's also days a little bit of CEO power, but they're much weaker.

329
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:27,436
Speaker 1: Well, yeah They're also much more balanced and fair.

330
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:29,102
Speaker 1: But the other thing is the DS one.

331
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:36,037
Speaker 0: They're way OP with the double power God and that source DS is Broke, I'll use a little Eagle and a Sammy.

332
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:42,474
Speaker 1: Eagle and Sammy combined is like a one one turn One action KO.

333
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:47,627
Speaker 0: my infantry my infantry can see like a blurry Mirage of your HQ.

334
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:47,988
Speaker 0: I win.

335
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:52,744
Speaker 1: Yep Yes, it's just unbalanceable fun nonsense.

336
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:54,250
Speaker 1: So I will see how this all goes.

337
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:59,935
Speaker 1: I'm pretty excited about this just because advanced wars was kind of forgotten Except among weirdos like me.

338
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:07,258
Speaker 1: and now that community is so excited that I found all the advanced wars streamers Everyone came out of the woodwork.

339
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,048
Speaker 1: I even started streaming advanced wars again.

340
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:28,977
Speaker 1: okay, in some other news Nintendo announced these Nintendo switch Pro and fanboys egged on by the less well-written Less well-curated gaming media had this idea in their head that this was gonna be a more powerful switch for some reason or a 4k.

341
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:37,030
Speaker 0: me if you look his Nintendo has a history right of going back to you know way in the olden days right super olden days the NES.

342
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,455
Speaker 0: They made a top loading NES.

343
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:42,390
Speaker 0: right the SNES they made there's like a better SNES model.

344
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,074
Speaker 0: That's like different.

345
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:44,925
Speaker 0: that looks sort of like a top loading NES.

346
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:45,871
Speaker 0: if you've never seen it It's.

347
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:46,737
Speaker 0: there's not a lot of them.

348
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:48,489
Speaker 0: I've you know, I don't see them often but they exist.

349
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:50,633
Speaker 0: There is.

350
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:51,457
Speaker 0: there was the Game Boy.

351
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:54,450
Speaker 1: then there was the Game Boy Pocket Game Boy Pocket Game Boy Color.

352
00:22:54,894 --> 00:22:56,649
Speaker 0: The Game Boy Pocket was just a lot better.

353
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,956
Speaker 0: There's a Game Boy Color.

354
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:01,910
Speaker 0: remember the Game Boys Game Boy Advance the Game Boy Advance.

355
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,983
Speaker 0: There was a Game Boy Advance SP and then a Game Boy Advance micro.

356
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:06,490
Speaker 0: It's like they upgraded that shit twice.

357
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,206
Speaker 0: Oh, you know the DS there was DS lite.

358
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:18,426
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, it's like Nintendo has a history of re-releasing consoles in Superior versions that are upgraded and with the 3ds.

359
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,850
Speaker 0: Right the 3ds could be considered one of those but also sort of a new console, right?

360
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:35,348
Speaker 0: But with the 3ds they tried something that they hadn't done before Which is they made the three the new 3ds which actually was a like a better processor, right?

361
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,747
Speaker 0: And There were games that would only play on 3ds.

362
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:42,710
Speaker 0: It would not play on regular DS and that did not do very well.

363
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,941
Speaker 0: It was a very small number of games.

364
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,810
Speaker 0: none of them were really significant.

365
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:55,570
Speaker 1: better when they did it more like the Game Boy Color where Some games would have a little bit of extra fun stuff or look different if you played it.

366
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,536
Speaker 0: Well the Game Boy Color.

367
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,709
Speaker 0: there were Game Boy Color exclusive games.

368
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:08,423
Speaker 0: But there were also these sort of DX cartridges and they like re-released like Link's awakening on a DX cartridge For example and Metroid 2 on the DX cartridge that added that there's.

369
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:09,970
Speaker 1: that adds that skeleton puzzle.

370
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:16,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, those exactly yeah those cartridges could play in an old-school Game Boy or pocket and they would just be normal.

371
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,470
Speaker 0: But if they played him on a Game Boy Color.

372
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:22,910
Speaker 0: They would be fancier than if you took the original Game Boy cartridge and put in a Game Boy Color.

373
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:30,060
Speaker 1: But generally you can't release an iteration on an existing console where now there's a bunch of games That just won't work on the old console.

374
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,429
Speaker 1: because now game people have to say Do I make a game using the better?

375
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,092
Speaker 1: Capabilities?

376
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:38,449
Speaker 1: knowing only a small number of people from this base have this they almost have to treat it like a new console.

377
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:45,610
Speaker 0: or Yeah, everything compatible Right or yeah exactly do the DX model right where you you make your game?

378
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:52,270
Speaker 0: So it works on old switches But also new switches and if someone has a new switch your game is better somehow and that adds to development cost.

379
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:56,839
Speaker 1: so what they announced was actually What I expected and I think is a perfectly like.

380
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:59,750
Speaker 1: if I need a second switch or if mine dies or something like.

381
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,673
Speaker 1: this Is what I would buy.

382
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:09,130
Speaker 1: the updated Nintendo switch has better battery life Be a partly because it has a bigger nicer OLED screen.

383
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,175
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm in the comments.

384
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:13,604
Speaker 0: There's and there's some other minor upgrades.

385
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,130
Speaker 0: I think it might have more storage inside.

386
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:23,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's a few minor upgrades like that, but games will run the same as was it's yes It's not really it's.

387
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,741
Speaker 0: it's obviously a better switch.

388
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:26,349
Speaker 0: if you're buying a switch today, right?

389
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,512
Speaker 0: You're either a need to save money for some reason in which case by the old switch or used old switch because those are still Just great.

390
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:38,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, or if you have money and you want to get the best switch obviously buy the OLED switch.

391
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,487
Speaker 0: Why would you buy the other one?

392
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:45,210
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like they released the what we expected to be the upgraded switch.

393
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,219
Speaker 0: But all these these video game news sites they were all like, oh, there's gonna be an upgraded switch which is like.

394
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:54,738
Speaker 0: I hate it when they Report on these newses right?

395
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:55,260
Speaker 0: Like.

396
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:03,330
Speaker 0: it's like if someone comes out and like, you know July and is like Phone big leaks new iPhone this September or October.

397
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:13,290
Speaker 0: It's like there's been a new iPhone every September slash October every year Thousand and like, you know Are you a press release or are you in fact just a scheduled appointment?

398
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:14,531
Speaker 0: Exactly.

399
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:19,817
Speaker 0: It's like no Nintendo's gonna release an upgraded better switch and it's like yeah They like.

400
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:22,070
Speaker 0: I just said even the NES got one of those, right?

401
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:28,814
Speaker 0: It's now every single Nintendo console is going to get an upgraded version at some point in its life I can't like.

402
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:29,918
Speaker 0: maybe the Wii U didn't.

403
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,724
Speaker 0: I think that might be the only one.

404
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:34,563
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to point out game cube Didn't I guess?

405
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,040
Speaker 1: Didn't really have any like it.

406
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,350
Speaker 0: there wasn't like a better game.

407
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:45,650
Speaker 1: Well, the brother the game cube was just so like perfect that they just made a new console to try to get into different territory.

408
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:49,110
Speaker 0: The point is game news sites reported on that, right?

409
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:58,698
Speaker 0: They got people, you know hyped up, but they reported on something ridiculous, which they were saying Oh, you seem like a 4k switch and it's like No, that's not gonna happen.

410
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:04,938
Speaker 1: or if it could it would suck for a more powerful switch That would have higher frame rates for third-party games.

411
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,764
Speaker 1: Like that was something people were talking about.

412
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,295
Speaker 0: Yeah that it wasn't gonna happen I think.

413
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:09,860
Speaker 0: why would they?

414
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:14,239
Speaker 1: so there was a whole Of some fanboys like arguing this.

415
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,905
Speaker 1: but the three things I want to point out about that space like to sort of nail this point home is one.

416
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:31,770
Speaker 1: Nintendo's philosophy as they have publicly stated for many many many years decades Even is use existing proven cheap technology to make games that are good at a profit.

417
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:36,608
Speaker 1: Don't use the newest most advanced technology that is not necessary to make good games.

418
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:38,816
Speaker 0: That is like Yeah, does it make the game more fun?

419
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:41,064
Speaker 0: No, no, it does not right.

420
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:41,546
Speaker 0: Yep

421
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:57,828
Speaker 1: number two Nintendo's not gonna fracture the the user base and that's like sale base the addressable market if you want to talk about like product management Of the Nintendo switch when it is still a very healthy extremely popular console still running through

422
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:00,456
Speaker 0: the number one The number one console by a lot.

423
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:04,007
Speaker 1: and three the people who said oh, why why did they?

424
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:05,010
Speaker 1: if they upgraded the screen?

425
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,357
Speaker 1: Why couldn't they make it 4k?

426
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:08,610
Speaker 1: Why can't they make it support these third-party games?

427
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,624
Speaker 1: I can ask that question in one two, three, four five words and those five words are the ps5 weighs 10 pounds.

428
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, you would have to make like a switch.

429
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:23,005
Speaker 0: that would effectively be no different than a ps5.

430
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,750
Speaker 0: it would just play Nintendo games.

431
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,770
Speaker 1: I just imagine it take a pit to pick up pick up a pay PlayStation 5 tape to joy cons to the side.

432
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:34,181
Speaker 1: That is what a 4k 60 where.

433
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:34,783
Speaker 0: how are you that?

434
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,970
Speaker 0: a PlayStation 5 has external power though?

435
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,572
Speaker 0: You would need to.

436
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:39,300
Speaker 0: where's the battery going?

437
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,229
Speaker 1: strap a car battery to your waist?

438
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:43,556
Speaker 1: Like the legendary.

439
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,170
Speaker 1: Oh, I got a tree for it with six car batteries and a Sega.

440
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:48,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, 4k is for 1080p screens.

441
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,560
Speaker 0: So at merrim actually bare minimum.

442
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:59,221
Speaker 0: you could do it if you had well considering a switch That's undocked and has to go on battery power.

443
00:28:59,241 --> 00:28:59,844
Speaker 0: I could do 720p, right?

444
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,617
Speaker 0: That's 720p is what?

445
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:04,979
Speaker 0: isn't that?

446
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,087
Speaker 0: you're gonna need four of those to make a 1080p?

447
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it takes 16 switches and a stack and tape them in a bundle.

448
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:17,270
Speaker 1: You gotta it is literally for any reasonable price point.

449
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:23,150
Speaker 1: Impossible to have the specs of something like a PlayStation 5 in the form factor of a Nintendo switch.

450
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:25,320
Speaker 1: It's not a matter of just do it better.

451
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:26,908
Speaker 1: It's a matter of you fucking can't.

452
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:32,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also just want to point out I think that there's you know, there's like this impression.

453
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:40,830
Speaker 0: You know the impressions of how big things are at something I talk about I guess a lot whenever it comes up right like how eSports are actually bigger than a lot of pro sports.

454
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,970
Speaker 0: But because the pro sports are on television and there's more money in them, right?

455
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:54,210
Speaker 0: It's like you don't realize how big you know League of Legends is Because the amount of money behind it and the amount of eyeballs behind it are not in alignment, right?

456
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,570
Speaker 0: There's a lot of money behind NFL football, but there's not a lot as many eyeballs, right?

457
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:11,478
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you would think soccer is you know, if you lived in the US before there was internet You would think soccer was no big deal because you can't see right, you know So much in the same way.

458
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:19,965
Speaker 0: I think in the video game console world Right, the bigness of PC gaming is sort of invisible because people can't see.

459
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:27,670
Speaker 0: people who live in console countries Like the United States can't see all the countries that don't have any fucking consoles as PC gaming only, right?

460
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,037
Speaker 0: and people also can't see How small actually the.

461
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:36,709
Speaker 0: the quote hardcore only because I don't have a better word for it.

462
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:52,063
Speaker 0: PlayStation Xbox console audience is relative to the switch audience Because the vast majority of these switch, you know phone game, you know Audience right are not in the gaming communities, right?

463
00:30:52,344 --> 00:31:02,233
Speaker 0: So someone comes around and is like hey You know Nintendo already has like all these, you know, they've got everything but they don't have that hardcore Audience right?

464
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:10,489
Speaker 0: if Nintendo would just make you know an ultra powerful console and they got all those games that you know Sony and Microsoft have you know the calls of duty and whatever.

465
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:14,270
Speaker 0: They would just take over the whole console world and that would be it monopoly.

466
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:20,950
Speaker 1: Nope Anyone who cares about those games already has a PlayStation or an Xbox gaming PC and or they have a switch also.

467
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:22,283
Speaker 0: probably they probably do.

468
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:26,830
Speaker 0: but The thing is Nintendo could do that, right?

469
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,450
Speaker 0: That's a possible thing, but the perception is that like that would be a worthwhile endeavor.

470
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:41,989
Speaker 0: But if you look I think that the truth is if you look at the pie of console gaming The PlayStation Xbox piece of the pie is not a big piece of the pie.

471
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:47,568
Speaker 0: Nintendo has the entire rest of the fucking pie, which I'm is well over half.

472
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:53,376
Speaker 0: Yep, right It might even be two-thirds of the pie and you know Nintendo has a piece right.

473
00:31:53,396 --> 00:31:57,710
Speaker 0: those people with PlayStation and Xboxes some of them already have switches also, right?

474
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,447
Speaker 0: But the the you know, those core hardcore Call of Duty people, right?

475
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:04,973
Speaker 0: It's like You know, it's.

476
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:08,283
Speaker 0: it's like none of the PlayStation and Xbox.

477
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:10,770
Speaker 0: They've got none of that Nintendo pie.

478
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:21,350
Speaker 0: They're not infiltrating it in any way whatsoever You know, well, so actually the question you should be asking is not why doesn't Nintendo just eliminate them and take over the game?

479
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:24,450
Speaker 1: Try to get into Nintendo's grill and great with them?

480
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,854
Speaker 0: And I just why.

481
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:30,810
Speaker 0: how come Microsoft or Sony or or any of the companies that make games to their platforms?

482
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:42,108
Speaker 0: How come they have made absolutely no attempt whatsoever to make a fun Quality game that doesn't rely on just ridiculous horsepower, you know, whatever, right?

483
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,206
Speaker 0: How come they can't make a game as good as Breath of the Wild?

484
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,922
Speaker 0: and you know Put it on compete with they're not even trying.

485
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:49,430
Speaker 1: so there's another angle here.

486
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:55,145
Speaker 1: That's especially important considering there are massive supply chain disruptions globally right now for a lot of reasons.

487
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,148
Speaker 1: chips are hard to get.

488
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:59,766
Speaker 1: so Why would Nintendo move into new?

489
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,330
Speaker 1: Difficult to acquire more expensive chips instead of solidifying supply lines?

490
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,595
Speaker 1: They've already protected.

491
00:33:07,096 --> 00:33:10,790
Speaker 1: but Matt Piscatella is the NPD analyst and he he's a big player in the space.

492
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:17,610
Speaker 1: He tweeted an analysis of this that I want to read because it's very short and it describes like the final piece of the puzzle.

493
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:18,352
Speaker 1: Quote.

494
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:24,349
Speaker 1: back in the day Nintendo portable revisions would stabilize the demand curve and firm up ASP's.

495
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:30,510
Speaker 1: They were about maintaining sales performance and preventing the pull of price drops and stale inventory.

496
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:33,969
Speaker 1: The switch oled is right out of that successful playbook.

497
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:35,794
Speaker 0: Exactly, right.

498
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:36,256
Speaker 0: It's the.

499
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:39,810
Speaker 0: as time goes on, you know the parts that are in a switch, right?

500
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,636
Speaker 0: They you know, they sort of get outdated.

501
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:42,841
Speaker 0: They're not easier to get.

502
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:45,230
Speaker 0: the factories are making newer different things, right?

503
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,390
Speaker 0: They're not, you know, the screen clearly is that is the key component here, right?

504
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,290
Speaker 0: So yeah, they stop making the kind of screen that's in the switch.

505
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:52,296
Speaker 0: They're making these over.

506
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:54,710
Speaker 0: the factory is switched over to making oled screens.

507
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:55,590
Speaker 0: Okay.

508
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,282
Speaker 0: so we if we it'll be more economical for us to use those screens in the switch now instead of the old screen that no one's making anymore.

509
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:08,170
Speaker 0: and Bonus we can raise the price on it right and get a get a marketing thing out of it.

510
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:16,253
Speaker 0: Maybe someone will upgrade right, you know, but it's mostly just to you know, stabilize the the production process most of the time.

511
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:27,643
Speaker 1: if you ask especially if you're some gamer nerd like us included and you ask like why doesn't company aid do X the answer is almost always Because that wouldn't make any money or because in Nintendo's case.

512
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,150
Speaker 1: They're already printing money.

513
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,123
Speaker 1: They do not that they they're doing what they know to do to make money.

514
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:35,250
Speaker 1: your idea is something more money.

515
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:39,150
Speaker 0: It's something to do with it's all and especially when it's any technology.

516
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:53,563
Speaker 0: Right a lot of the decisions from almost, you know Almost every technology company and if hardware is involved have to do with something going on in the factory supply chain level That you know absolutely nothing about and you're not factoring into any of your thinking.

517
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,545
Speaker 0: you're only thinking about.

518
00:34:54,565 --> 00:35:02,170
Speaker 0: you know things on your end when you know with games of like You know the game you want to play or you know, how fun it is or what's hot now?

519
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:06,563
Speaker 1: You're thinking from your perspective of I play these games.

520
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:08,590
Speaker 1: I would like to play those games on a switch.

521
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:11,309
Speaker 1: I assume everyone else does exactly what I do.

522
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:14,642
Speaker 1: Why don't companies cater to me this giant demographic?

523
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:16,690
Speaker 1: and the answer is you're not a big demographic.

524
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:19,056
Speaker 0: You're one person like advanced wars.

525
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:21,745
Speaker 1: if I why doesn't intend to make a new advanced wars?

526
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:23,110
Speaker 1: because they wouldn't make any fucking money.

527
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:24,077
Speaker 1: Making a new advanced worse.

528
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:24,742
Speaker 1: No one would.

529
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:25,810
Speaker 1: there's no way to make money.

530
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,800
Speaker 0: I think it also.

531
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:28,313
Speaker 0: I think it also You know.

532
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:33,403
Speaker 0: just to bring it back to the things being you know The this perception of size versus the reality of size.

533
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:35,050
Speaker 0: I blame two people for that, right?

534
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,397
Speaker 0: Not too individually but two groups of people.

535
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:41,710
Speaker 1: on the next Wednesday show we'll talk about this with the recent news about graphic novel sales.

536
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:52,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, the people who control who have who collect the data do not release it freely and they do not release it in ways that Are directly and obviously Comparable, right?

537
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:57,390
Speaker 0: It's like even if you look at like, you know, how many did Animal Crossing sell versus Call of Duty?

538
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,042
Speaker 0: They don't have the digital sales for Animal Crossing.

539
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,650
Speaker 0: They only have the physical sales, right?

540
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:07,053
Speaker 0: It's like you can't directly compare any of these fucking things to actually prove like Without.

541
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:11,430
Speaker 1: you can if you are in the industry and pay money to access data to make decision.

542
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,598
Speaker 0: Even if you pay money the data might not be.

543
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:14,200
Speaker 0: you know that?

544
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:14,903
Speaker 1: oh, yeah some.

545
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:16,710
Speaker 1: some data is just not available.

546
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,475
Speaker 1: Some data is bespoke.

547
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:23,389
Speaker 1: Sometimes if you want certain kinds of data, you've got to hire a firm to go generate that data from nothing.

548
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:34,410
Speaker 0: Yep, and a lot of the data that comes out is always, you know They say it in a specific way right to make themselves look in the best light if you watch any Apple keynote for examples.

549
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:44,678
Speaker 0: And then the second thing is I blame the journalists for not putting you know things in the correct size Comparison right?

550
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:55,767
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, if you're a journalist You just got to come out with the truth and be like look You know There are like twice as many people with switches out there than PlayStation 5 is or whatever the reality is like.

551
00:36:55,927 --> 00:37:02,886
Speaker 0: make people's Perception match the reality of the world of how popular and big things really are.

552
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:12,090
Speaker 0: don't make the thing That you know is buying ads Or that you play right seem bigger than it actually is, right?

553
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:21,670
Speaker 0: figure out how many eyeballs are watching a thing or playing a thing and Then you know when you're creating the perception of reality in your journalism and media.

554
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:22,573
Speaker 0: Right have it.

555
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:23,936
Speaker 0: match the numbers right.

556
00:37:23,957 --> 00:37:27,647
Speaker 0: if something is small time then poo-poo it be like that small time.

557
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:30,805
Speaker 0: and if something is big Time, you know, don't poo-poo it.

558
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:32,968
Speaker 0: make it You know as big as it is.

559
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:39,432
Speaker 0: Right the animal crossing coverage on your site should be like twice or three times as big as the Call of Duty coverage on your Site.

560
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:42,029
Speaker 0: that's just how it should be right don't go.

561
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:42,812
Speaker 0: You know.

562
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:49,218
Speaker 0: if you if you make a big splash on your site and then you know for one and not the other that doesn't Match the number of eyeballs.

563
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,179
Speaker 0: First of all, you're only hurting yourself Right.

564
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,149
Speaker 0: I don't know why you do this.

565
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:58,628
Speaker 0: And two you're creating the false perception in the world which damages Yeah.

566
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:11,370
Speaker 1: Like if you want to get an example of this look at how many people watch I don't know the Lowell Championships versus watch the Super Bowl or the Stanley Cup and that'll really change your perspective on like the relative popularity of things

567
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:16,382
Speaker 0: or It's really not popular compared to a lot of eSports.

568
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:22,646
Speaker 1: or look at how many Manga sell in a given month compared to how many superhero comics sell in like a decade.

569
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:24,114
Speaker 1: Yep for real.

570
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:33,349
Speaker 1: so in some last news, uh That Super Mario 64 cartridge is directly relevant to our main bit today.

571
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:35,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the we'll just talk about.

572
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,263
Speaker 0: we'll bring it up again in the main bit.

573
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,310
Speaker 0: But yes, somebody sold a sealed.

574
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:40,540
Speaker 0: There was a while.

575
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,670
Speaker 0: there were two recent sales.

576
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:56,220
Speaker 0: there was as original NES Zelda cartridge sealed in shrink-wrap that was sold for a Ridiculously large amount of money and then there was an Mario 64 cartridge in the box still shrink-wrapped You know in the plastic protecting case and everything right.

577
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:03,166
Speaker 0: that also sold for the most ever like 9.8 a plus plus water rating.

578
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,270
Speaker 1: like they have a whole system.

579
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:10,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever their system is but just some ridiculous one point something million price and what's happening here.

580
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:17,090
Speaker 0: Is that Basically, you know people are pumping up the bids right in order to create a market for these things.

581
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:25,086
Speaker 0: You know people who probably have a lot of you know A large collection right of sealed cartridges because they were right.

582
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:31,325
Speaker 0: probably, you know You bid high on a few right just to make the perception be that they're rare and expensive.

583
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:37,163
Speaker 0: and then you can you know Slowly sell your collection off and profit greatly, right?

584
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:38,909
Speaker 0: So do not buy.

585
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:43,744
Speaker 0: Do not get into the sealed cartridge trading collecting game at all.

586
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:45,250
Speaker 0: Don't do it there.

587
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:53,353
Speaker 1: If you want to play these games you can get a cartridge that will work fine and just buy it like they're cheap They're available.

588
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:54,297
Speaker 1: You can also emulate.

589
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:57,410
Speaker 0: you get an unboxed Mario 64 cartridges like a dollar.

590
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:07,590
Speaker 1: It's like just growing on trees, but also these like these artifacts I'd say that in general gets its main bit But that kind of collecting always roughly the wrong way because it's very much in Indiana Jones.

591
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,650
Speaker 1: This belongs in a museum situation at best.

592
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,923
Speaker 0: Actually, no, but we'll talk about the main bow.

593
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:15,990
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that in a bit.

594
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:20,390
Speaker 1: I could see a one of these being in a museum somewhere for archaeological purposes.

595
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:25,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, the museum people I've seen the game preservationists on I've seen on 20.

596
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:29,402
Speaker 1: They're mostly focused on preserving all of the media and all of the game.

597
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:31,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're basically completely uninterested.

598
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:31,992
Speaker 0: They're big.

599
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:33,136
Speaker 0: They're like it's pointless to.

600
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:35,204
Speaker 0: you know, retail stuff is not rare.

601
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,590
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be lost to time.

602
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,583
Speaker 0: We don't give you know, here's an example.

603
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:54,968
Speaker 1: I would give before we Imagine if a museum had a recreation of like an accurate recreation with all real goods of the ticket-taking aisle of NES games from a Toys R Us in the 80s like that would be a zip it.

604
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:58,269
Speaker 0: I mean you would like that but that's not really.

605
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:00,557
Speaker 0: Preservationists aren't interested in that right?

606
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:01,320
Speaker 0: It's like it's not.

607
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,367
Speaker 0: it's not the kind of things not important for.

608
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:06,843
Speaker 0: you know The the kind of video game preservation is out there.

609
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:09,435
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah for most of it There's other I've seen.

610
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:13,230
Speaker 1: there are people who are interested in the ancillary experiences like a round.

611
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:13,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are.

612
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:20,738
Speaker 0: people are interested in that but from it seems that like from a preservationist point of view the kind of like a Actual museum curators.

613
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,770
Speaker 0: That's not the stuff they're interested in it at all.

614
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,118
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit about preserving those things because they're.

615
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,628
Speaker 0: they're just like common and out there, right?

616
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:31,739
Speaker 0: They're not rare Special or you know, and they're not useful.

617
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:32,441
Speaker 0: you have emulators.

618
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:34,126
Speaker 0: You have other ways things are preserved.

619
00:41:34,788 --> 00:41:35,270
Speaker 0: They don't need that.

620
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,990
Speaker 1: Well anyway things of the day.

624
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:11,750

625
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:18,110
Speaker 1: But in the fifth generation games you were placed one full step in front of the Pokemon Center instead.

626
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:22,086
Speaker 0: I didn't know that but I mean, I knew it takes you to the Pokemon Center, but I didn't know.

630
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:32,487

631
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:39,866
Speaker 0: Okay So you got so also in collecting sort of news, right this is really recent.

638
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:02,530
Speaker 0: It's like when she was growing up, right?

639
00:43:02,773 --> 00:43:08,042
Speaker 0: She didn't have the NES She had you know The LCD games like the little tiny Coleco that plays pac-man.

640
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:10,050
Speaker 0: only that looks like a little arcade cabinet, right?

641
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,301
Speaker 0: Yeah, like little electronic football with the LED lights in it, right?

642
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:24,346
Speaker 0: That's the kind of game that she was growing up with and in fact getting those games and you know Repairing them when she was a kid led her to a career in electrical engineering.

643
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:25,269
Speaker 0: So that's that's awesome.

644
00:43:26,711 --> 00:43:29,561
Speaker 0: but yeah, so she went on to.

645
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:36,928
Speaker 0: you know, she just loved the fuck out of those things and Began collecting them at some point and has built up a collection that the.

646
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:41,989
Speaker 0: you know I'm not a fan of the Guinness Book of World Records, which has a lot of problems, but you know, it's a true thing.

647
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:47,023
Speaker 0: She has the largest collection of LCD gaming systems on earth with is 1599.

648
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:48,326
Speaker 0: I'm she might have 1600 by now.

649
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:50,368
Speaker 0: She finds just one.

650
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:55,966
Speaker 0: And the largest collection of playable gaming systems right at 2430, right?

651
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,468
Speaker 0: It's a two thousand four hundred and thirty, you know video game systems, right?

652
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:09,269
Speaker 0: And she has other things as well Like if you watch the video you can see she has every and every US NES cartridge right in a box.

653
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:12,610
Speaker 0: I don't think all of them are shrink-wrapped, but she has all of them, right?

654
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,518
Speaker 0: I think with boxes and manuals like she just has.

655
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,445
Speaker 0: you know, I guess she made good money.

656
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:18,990
Speaker 0: electrical engineering, right?

657
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:22,070
Speaker 0: And it says she's in Texas with the cost of living is low.

658
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,885
Speaker 0: So plenty of money to spend on collecting these things not all of which are expensive and is.

659
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:27,647
Speaker 0: and she also.

660
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,909
Speaker 0: she started way long ago, right but when you know, there was less hype.

661
00:44:32,892 --> 00:44:40,490
Speaker 0: See she just has a massive collection and you know We'll talk about again in the main bit but in the video she just whips them out and plays them, right?

662
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,982
Speaker 0: She is not one of those shrink-wrapped.

663
00:44:43,002 --> 00:44:46,336
Speaker 0: turn the page wash your hands Kind of collectors, right?

664
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,360
Speaker 0: She is like children.

665
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,724
Speaker 0: come into my collecting room.

666
00:44:48,804 --> 00:44:57,067
Speaker 1: Let us play, you know That's like the classic arcade guys like yes, here's these very rare difficult to prepare like electromechanical games.

667
00:44:57,147 --> 00:44:58,110
Speaker 1: Please come and play them.

668
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,017
Speaker 1: They're meant to be played.

669
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:00,690
Speaker 0: I learned in this bit.

670
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,758
Speaker 0: There's two a few things I learned in this video.

671
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:06,351
Speaker 0: one of that was really interesting is that you know Simon right the four button Simon.

672
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:09,722
Speaker 0: apparently in Japan the Simon was white and not black.

673
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,427
Speaker 0: She said she has a white Simon.

674
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,170
Speaker 1: Oh, I see that photo.

675
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:13,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

676
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:22,438
Speaker 0: And the other thing that I thought was really notable in this video is how she has a lot of sports related games Right, especially those LCD LED ones.

677
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:23,884
Speaker 0: A lot of them were sports related.

678
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:25,210
Speaker 1: I had a few of those.

679
00:45:26,231 --> 00:45:32,939
Speaker 0: She's always point she knows and points out who the athletes are on All of the games that have.

680
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:36,272
Speaker 0: like an actual pro athlete on the box She's like.

681
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:37,877
Speaker 0: she's like look there's OJ Simpson.

Speaker 0: You know, there's the someone's on that.

691
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:04,262
Speaker 0: It's just like a random football drawing on some box and there's a guy you can tell with a team and the number and she's like Oh, there's so-and-so on the box.

692
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:05,169
Speaker 0: It's like.

693
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:09,390
Speaker 0: So I appreciate that appreciation that she has there.

Speaker 1: We play a game that neither one of us had played before the actual pitfall - which was Surprisingly good and we learned some stuff about it in the course.

713
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:42,490
Speaker 0: I didn't even really know it existed.

714
00:47:42,852 --> 00:47:44,843
Speaker 1: Yeah, that song that plays the checkpoints.

715
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:47,699
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on there So they can't be.

716
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:49,046
Speaker 0: camp packs online.

717
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:57,750
Speaker 0: 2021 Discord is Live, I guess if you bought a ticket for with money, but soon it will be open to the general public.

718
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,708

721
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:14,649
Speaker 1: though If it's really sunny on Saturday, I might be doing that like from a park somewhere at a laptop.

722
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows what's gonna happen?

723
00:48:16,842 --> 00:48:23,750
Speaker 1: But uh, yeah Yeah, so there's that and Scott introduce a new bit in the last geek night.

724
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:24,593
Speaker 1: So we're gonna keep going.

725
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:26,742
Speaker 1: only one of us can do it for a show.

726
00:48:26,762 --> 00:48:28,650
Speaker 1: So I'm doing it this time second dibs.

727
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,363
Speaker 0: So yeah, I successfully I successfully sold the monitor to the listener.

728
00:48:33,423 --> 00:48:35,730
Speaker 0: They received it today and seemed to be happy with it.

729
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,490
Speaker 0: So hooray, let's see if rim can can manage to sell something.

730
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:47,237
Speaker 1: Yeah So I have the ogre big battle box that gigantic fucking box That is like all of ogre.

731
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,164
Speaker 1: It was one of the first kickstarters.

732
00:48:49,465 --> 00:48:50,629
Speaker 0: You had to explain what it is.

733
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,960
Speaker 1: So ogre is a game by Steve Jackson.

734
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:59,142
Speaker 1: That is actually a really cool Asymmetric two-player war game like capital W war.

735
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:02,070
Speaker 0: It's a it's a it's a really old turn-based.

736
00:49:02,352 --> 00:49:04,970
Speaker 0: You know war, you know map things on a map war game.

737
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,206
Speaker 0: But it was out of print for a long time and they kick-started to bring it back in print.

738
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:11,634
Speaker 0: and when they kick-started it They went all.

739
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:12,377
Speaker 0: they went too far.

740
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:15,627
Speaker 1: I believe the technical term would be whole hog on this.

741
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:17,957
Speaker 0: they went ham They they went ham.

742
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:20,830
Speaker 1: So this box is like the size of an end table.

743
00:49:21,331 --> 00:49:23,899
Speaker 1: It includes so many components.

744
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,950
Speaker 1: It is everything that ever existed for even tangentially related to ogre.

745
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:30,890
Speaker 1: You can play every scenario every everything.

746
00:49:31,437 --> 00:49:32,329
Speaker 1: It's kind of amazing.

747
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:40,114
Speaker 1: But I live in a New York City apartment and this thing is way too big to play in that and you never played it Even one time.

748
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:41,259
Speaker 1: nope, because there's not.

749
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:45,310
Speaker 0: I would have played it anyway any time if you would have said hey Let's actually take a whole day and play ogre.

750
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:48,101
Speaker 0: You just never wanted to do that and never you know when I would.

751
00:49:48,142 --> 00:49:58,469
Speaker 1: you know when we would have if we had a house With a gaming table where I could just leave it set up for a period of time Like one of those ones where I can like put a cover over it and use the table.

752
00:49:59,494 --> 00:50:00,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that didn't happen.

753
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:01,750
Speaker 0: So now you're stuck with it.

754
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:09,708
Speaker 1: This is second dibs because I do know some people who once it is safe for me to visit them They may be willing to take it from me.

755
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:16,422
Speaker 1: Uh, and there's a game store who if I'm willing to drive it there, which at some point I will be in that place at the right time.

756
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:17,829
Speaker 1: I will give it to them.

757
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:31,482
Speaker 1: but if you want this giant box and I'll link to it before I Deal with it in one of these other ways you're willing to pay for shipping I will mail it to you, but I will warn you.

758
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:32,365
Speaker 0: so shipping only.

759
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:33,490
Speaker 0: you're selling it for zero dollars.

760
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,637
Speaker 1: I'll sell it for zero dollars.

761
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:38,396
Speaker 1: You're willing to pay for shipping And I will warn you.

762
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:39,764
Speaker 1: shipping will not be cheap.

763
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:40,890
Speaker 1: This thing is also heavy.

764
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,252
Speaker 0: Hmm And with that's how far it goes, you know, if you're not shipping it far It could be.

765
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:53,309
Speaker 1: I mean if you live in New York City, if so, and you'll bring me at like Queensborough Plaza I will carry it there and hand it to you.

766
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:59,102
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's get right into it in our main bit.

767
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:00,930
Speaker 1: collecting collecting and games.

768
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,086
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of things we have to say about collecting things in general.

769
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:06,250
Speaker 0: We're gonna avoid those.

770
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:25,390
Speaker 0: I want to talk specifically, you know on the collecting of games specifically the cartridges to games that had cartridges or you know games that were said were sold physically on CDs or whatever right and Also the video games and also the collecting of tabletop games right board games and boxes, right?

771
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:31,130
Speaker 0: Those two things only pertinent to those very specific collecting hobbies, right?

772
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:41,084
Speaker 0: So in the video game hobby, right we're seeing the usual things we're seeing and other collecting hobbies Which is people doing it for the money.

773
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:46,530
Speaker 0: Yep, right Speculation right you're buying a you know some cartridge.

774
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:50,100
Speaker 0: You know that's sealed in a box with a grade on it.

775
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,430
Speaker 0: because you think in some, you know found some greater fool.

776
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,921
Speaker 0: Okay, some number of years.

777
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:58,010
Speaker 0: It'll be worth even more and you can sell it again.

778
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,255
Speaker 0: So you think it's like an investment.

779
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:09,574
Speaker 0: right early some fool thinks it's an investment and you just sold it to them and you made Bank good on you, but you're evil, you know, rip or offer bad person Of course, it's.

780
00:52:09,695 --> 00:52:23,053
Speaker 1: it's tricky because our one could argue that well they found value in it, but Very few people I believe who collect those kinds of things are doing so for reasons other than thinking it's an investment Mm-hmm.

781
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:30,723
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean almost all of the games that people are paying these, you know We're seeing high prices for things like, you know, like I said Zelda 1 cartridge.

782
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:33,432
Speaker 0: It's like we have Zelda 1 guys It's right.

783
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:40,809
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if there was a Zelda 1 cartridge, it's just not like mint in box And I threw the manual away, but I've got it.

784
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:50,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know if we were seeing things like, you know ultra rare, you know prototype cartridge No one's no one has a ROM of this even.

785
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:56,555
Speaker 0: But that's the stuff Preservationists are actually looking for.

786
00:52:56,776 --> 00:53:08,470
Speaker 1: the cartridges that are selling for big bucks are selling primarily based on how Popular and how much current nostalgia is there for the game itself?

787
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,496
Speaker 1: Not the rarity of that particular piece of plastic Mm-hmm.

788
00:53:13,718 --> 00:53:15,029
Speaker 1: That's what's going on here.

789
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:20,001
Speaker 1: and The rarity of like mint in box.

790
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:24,296
Speaker 1: mint in box things seem to have a fairly constant level of rarity for a lot.

791
00:53:24,316 --> 00:53:34,110
Speaker 1: like you look at any given sector and you'll find like a percentage of mint in boxes from Unshipped inventory or lost in a warehouse like there's sort of a chart of those kinds of things anyway

792
00:53:34,573 --> 00:53:37,550
Speaker 0: But bought it but never gave it to my kid run Christmas because he misbehaved.

793
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,469
Speaker 1: Yeah found it in an attic fell off a truck.

794
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:51,244
Speaker 1: But I feel that that rarity like whether or not a mint in box exists irrespective of all the other factors involved Doesn't seem to actually be tied to the prices.

795
00:53:51,284 --> 00:53:52,430
Speaker 1: people are paying for these things.

796
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,636
Speaker 1: They're paying based on no.

797
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:56,048
Speaker 1: Mario 64 is a very important game.

798
00:53:57,073 --> 00:54:02,518
Speaker 1: Therefore this piece of plastic is very important Yep, which is not true at all.

799
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,230
Speaker 0: That's that's not how value things work, right?

800
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:07,410
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess it does is what is someone willing to pay?

801
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:16,490
Speaker 0: but the thing is was someone really willing to pay that or Someone was just paying that to trick others into being willing to pay that right?

802
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:22,649
Speaker 0: It's like they if you know if they had to keep it, right if they had to stick it could never resell it.

803
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:31,746
Speaker 0: And they could never you know, and it they didn't have any effect on boosting the prices of other things They owned, you know, if they were buying it to have it.

804
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:35,210
Speaker 0: and you know Would that person really have paid that much for the Mario 64?

805
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,389
Speaker 0: No, so it's not really what someone's willing to pay for it.

806
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also it's easy.

807
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:50,730
Speaker 1: this whole idea of a mint in box mostly came out of the rarity of like subsets of nostalgic items from like Well, like old baseball cards.

808
00:54:50,770 --> 00:55:02,239
Speaker 1: There were things that people didn't think were valuable and then over time got lost and destroyed and then eventually People wanted to have those things again and because they were rare The value went up like sure.

809
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:11,160
Speaker 1: that's reasonable like trying to think of a good like an old comic book the first appearance of Cyclops or the x-men or spider-man?

810
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:13,850
Speaker 0: Well, though some of those comics are really common, right?

811
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,099
Speaker 0: You can just like you want.

812
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,510
Speaker 0: you want a Dark Phoenix saga, right?

813
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,774
Speaker 0: This is something people don't realize.

814
00:55:17,874 --> 00:55:23,150
Speaker 0: is that x-men actually is a great example because x-men was so popular.

815
00:55:23,892 --> 00:55:29,790
Speaker 0: They sold so many comics that even these really hot you think these hot series like Dark Phoenix saga.

816
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,827
Speaker 0: It's like you can get a Dark Phoenix saga for not too much money because it was so popular.

817
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,610
Speaker 0: It was so great.

818
00:55:34,871 --> 00:55:37,063
Speaker 0: There's tons of them right now sold.

819
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:38,369
Speaker 0: it's sold, right?

820
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:53,270
Speaker 0: It's the shit that was either so old that people didn't care about preserving it like a you know, a spider Superman action comics whatever or Stuff that was less popular so there weren't too many out there, but then somehow gained significance later.

821
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:58,903
Speaker 1: Yeah But then there was a lot of news and a lot of pop culture ideas around.

822
00:55:59,244 --> 00:56:05,890
Speaker 1: those old things that actually were rare for various Reasons became valuable because more people wanted them than they existed.

823
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:18,390
Speaker 1: But then people started the trend of whenever anything new came out They would speculate on will this be the big popular thing in the future and try to keep mint in box versions as investments?

824
00:56:18,874 --> 00:56:22,275
Speaker 1: But because so many people did that They're still around.

825
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:23,199
Speaker 1: there's plenty of them.

826
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:35,035
Speaker 0: if you and if you think that well, okay, you know Even if something becomes a bust I just got to hold out even longer and hold out even longer and you hold out even longer until eventually it'll will be worth Something right?

827
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:36,482
Speaker 0: It's like no look at Beanie Babies.

828
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:38,210
Speaker 0: They won't be worth anything ever, right?

829
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,025
Speaker 0: It just they will not go up period the end, right?

830
00:56:41,507 --> 00:56:44,076
Speaker 0: So Yeah, video games.

831
00:56:44,116 --> 00:56:46,949
Speaker 0: I think you know the cartridges CDs, right?

832
00:56:47,430 --> 00:57:06,210
Speaker 0: You know the mint in box part makes even less sense because if you think about comic books, especially Part of the reason you want them to be mint and such and in the best possible condition is So that if you were to read them You could actually make out the fucking words and see the correct colors, right?

833
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:12,390
Speaker 0: Not that the printing technology was that great for old ones But you know the condition of the thing somewhat matters, right?

834
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:16,060
Speaker 0: Even the baseball card like the condition of it kind of matters.

835
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,507
Speaker 0: if you want to enjoy the thing, you know.

836
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,078
Speaker 0: looking at it right, you know.

837
00:57:20,098 --> 00:57:31,371
Speaker 0: and If you have a video game a beat-up old Mario 64 cartridge plays the same damn fucking game as a brand-new mitten box One.

838
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:32,676
Speaker 0: there is no fucking difference.

839
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:33,942
Speaker 0: Not one right?

840
00:57:34,263 --> 00:57:37,813
Speaker 0: So having it be mint Doesn't matter.

841
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:43,890
Speaker 0: It's a. the enjoyment level is unaffected as long as it's functioning, right?

842
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:54,930
Speaker 1: It's good to go now case in point when I was a kid the thing that I did fall into this trap and collect for a while because I Thought they'd be worth something because I'd see them being sold individual cards for a lot of money.

843
00:57:55,312 --> 00:57:57,844
Speaker 1: We're like those 90s x-men collectible cards.

844
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,858
Speaker 0: I Collected them just cuz I like the cards.

845
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:03,046
Speaker 0: I was actually looking at him recently.

846
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,010
Speaker 0: I still like those cards.

847
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:04,917
Speaker 0: I do like those cards a lot.

848
00:58:04,978 --> 00:58:06,490
Speaker 0: I was actually thinking like man.

849
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:12,089
Speaker 0: I was like is any I'm like are because I know there are still some collectible card sets being made these days.

850
00:58:13,735 --> 00:58:18,010
Speaker 0: But and I was like, hey I wonder if like is anyone made any x-men cards like right now?

851
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:18,893
Speaker 0: Is there a current?

852
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:20,198
Speaker 0: is there a current set?

853
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:23,270
Speaker 0: cuz like if there's a current set it's like maybe I would buy.

854
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:29,350
Speaker 1: So I just looked up one of the sets that I really liked and collected the 1990 impel Marvel Universe set.

855
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,721
Speaker 1: There were 162 cards in it.

856
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:31,890
Speaker 1: It's one of the sets I collected.

857
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:37,061
Speaker 1: You can buy a complete set of it today for under 200 bucks.

858
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:45,793
Speaker 1: And yeah, that's about right the most expensive card Like the going great in that entire set There's a few.

859
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:50,310
Speaker 0: they're a slightly hard to get but I think there's a special Stan Lee card in that set.

860
00:58:50,350 --> 00:59:01,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, like no one has a long shot that I can see but they the Punisher one goes for the whopping price of $4 Spicy.

861
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:02,604
Speaker 1: I feel like I would.

862
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:09,068
Speaker 1: I was paying like 75 cents to a dollar a card in 90s dollars when I was collecting these things.

863
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:14,829
Speaker 0: so Yeah, I actually for me it was the third impel series the space one.

864
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:16,197
Speaker 0: Oh, I had some of those.

865
00:59:16,237 --> 00:59:17,021
Speaker 1: I like those a lot.

866
00:59:17,644 --> 00:59:18,770
Speaker 0: I collected the most of those.

867
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:23,290
Speaker 1: I almost had the full set the one I tried to get the whole set of was the Wolverine specific series.

868
00:59:23,611 --> 00:59:25,803
Speaker 0: Well, those were really low quality cards paper.

869
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:27,090
Speaker 1: Yep, and then there were foils.

870
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:27,853
Speaker 0: I have I had like.

871
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:29,298
Speaker 0: I have like one pack of those.

872
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:33,194
Speaker 1: there would be occasional foil cards in those packs and I have like Two of the foils.

873
00:59:33,496 --> 00:59:35,145
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell those aren't worth anything either.

874
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:36,150
Speaker 0: not worth nothing.

875
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:39,490
Speaker 0: But we're supposed to be only talking about the video game.

876
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,816
Speaker 0: So the point is video game collecting.

877
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:48,432
Speaker 0: you're either collecting some retail object that is common as dirt that the price has been, you know Manipulated.

878
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:49,074
Speaker 0: right.

879
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:52,584
Speaker 0: if you're collecting something of actual historical value, right?

880
00:59:52,604 --> 01:00:07,243
Speaker 0: Like I said prototype cartridges Artifacts from you know development, you know ultra rare things It's like either a some of those things have been preserved right for example Like Nintendo World Championship cartridges, right?

881
01:00:07,263 --> 01:00:08,248
Speaker 0: You can get the ROM of that.

882
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:08,730
Speaker 0: No problem.

883
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,739
Speaker 0: Or those are the things that belong in a museum, right?

884
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,890
Speaker 0: If you get one, I feel you're morally responsible to be making a ROM, right?

885
01:00:18,956 --> 01:00:25,130
Speaker 0: You don't be Shouldn't be charging a bunch of money for those things either because we got into the comic book stuff.

886
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:25,492
Speaker 1: We're like.

887
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:33,190
Speaker 1: the thing itself has some intrinsic value because the thing was the thing But in this case the thing is the game and the game is just a bunch of code.

888
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:47,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no like historical, you know, like, you know It's not much historical value in preserving like the physical, you know, Mario Duck Hunt cartridge Even if it was the you know, maybe if it was the lat literal last one

889
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:53,186
Speaker 1: There's gotta be a few around somewhere that are preserved enough for someone to investigate them.

890
01:00:53,227 --> 01:01:00,490
Speaker 0: if we need to investigate them Right, but you know if you had for example, like, you know development builds of Mario Brothers, right?

891
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:05,510
Speaker 0: You know when you go to the Nintendo Store and have the pieces of paper where they were planning out Mario levels, right?

892
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:10,545
Speaker 0: Those have extreme significance right and should be in a museum and are worthy of collecting.

893
01:01:10,605 --> 01:01:14,663
Speaker 0: so I can see you know It's fun and cool, you know to have a collection.

894
01:01:14,703 --> 01:01:23,525
Speaker 0: right in my thing of the day Linda Like I said, she had every NES US release game, you know still in box right presumably with instruction manual at her wall.

895
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,070
Speaker 1: That's a compass a cool complete collection.

896
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:29,090
Speaker 1: She also has a bunch of standalone like playable console things like things.

897
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:32,080
Speaker 0: But she's playing that she's playing those right.

898
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,867
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, and it's like they're not.

899
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:37,044
Speaker 0: she's not treating them Like she's gonna resell them for a fortune, right?

900
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:45,070
Speaker 0: She legitimately Enjoys having them so she paid a price for them that are equal to the enjoyment that she felt she would get for them.

901
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:45,432
Speaker 0: She's not.

902
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:46,697
Speaker 0: she wasn't paying a price to them.

903
01:01:46,717 --> 01:01:49,188
Speaker 0: be like a hell sell these later and get rich, right?

904
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:58,170
Speaker 0: You know, she's doing well enough to have that collection in the first place In board games because we've gone on pretty long in this show already.

905
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:07,146
Speaker 1: but yeah board games are almost this special case that bother me more because We're not talking about like liking Warhammer figures because arguably you need those if you're playing Warhammer like.

906
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:07,788
Speaker 1: that's a different thing.

907
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:16,450
Speaker 0: Yeah Right the board game collecting world seems to be better in one way and that there isn't a lot of speculation there.

908
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:23,644
Speaker 0: You know, there isn't really a bunch of people other than magic cards like in Pokemon cards Which is the specific CCG area of table or

909
01:02:23,684 --> 01:02:24,870
Speaker 1: collectible is in the name

910
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:37,810
Speaker 0: right, but when you get to like a settlers or you know other than like a very few specific instances like maybe someone's got like The first settlers ever or someone's got an ancient monopoly or something like that, right?

911
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:41,950
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you're not buying and reselling board games for the money.

912
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:45,789
Speaker 0: There are some out of print games that end up going up in price just because they're out of print.

913
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,779
Speaker 0: But it's not a speculators market.

914
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,269
Speaker 0: you're not grading them and putting it in sealed boxes that can never be opened, right?

915
01:02:53,871 --> 01:03:03,163
Speaker 0: but what we are seeing are people who are buying tabletop games and Their primary interest they they're they're playing them, right?

916
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:06,454
Speaker 1: So they don't leave me but like they'll open it They'll play it once you sure.

917
01:03:06,474 --> 01:03:18,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're playing, you know, they're open and they're playing them some right but their primary interest is Having right they you know, or they're not playing them that much like we buy a game It's like we're playing the fuck out of it.

918
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:22,422
Speaker 0: We're studying it We're trying to figure out everything there is to figure out about its systems.

919
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:23,968
Speaker 0: We don't give a shit about the.

920
01:03:24,249 --> 01:03:34,610
Speaker 0: you know The the cardboard it's printed on right or the the dice that come with it or the miniatures That come with it or the quality of those miniatures or or you know, any of that stuff, right?

921
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,781
Speaker 0: You know, it's nice to have nice components, right?

922
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:39,919
Speaker 0: My new oath came with like metal coins Like I did buy the.

923
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:49,930
Speaker 1: I'm happy to play with the cardboard coins I don't give a shit like I did buy the limited edition when they re-release Puerto Rico like the last really good printing of it Because it came with like really nice coins and really nice components.

924
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:53,510
Speaker 1: But I didn't buy it because I thought it would be valuable or special.

925
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:56,030
Speaker 1: I bought it because it's more pleasant to play with those nice components.

926
01:03:56,391 --> 01:04:04,578
Speaker 1: Granted the first time I'm out at the table some fucking nerds spilled an entire coffee on like one of the boards, but It's still playable.

927
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:05,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not the worst.

928
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:15,356
Speaker 0: But when you look though Right at the board gaming community if you go somewhere like board game reddit, right or board game geek It becomes apparent.

929
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:17,670
Speaker 0: There are definitely people out there who care about playing games.

930
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:21,789
Speaker 0: You know, I think all the people who are you're not collecting games if you don't care about playing them at all, right?

931
01:04:22,331 --> 01:04:32,700
Speaker 0: but there are definitely people who care more or at least appear to care more about Owning than playing right?

932
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can see these people are.

933
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:44,329
Speaker 1: They're sleeving their cards, right there, you know Leaving cards ends up being a playability issue and expansions come out and things like that.

934
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:47,529
Speaker 1: And then you have a set of Warren cards mixed in with a set of brand new cards.

935
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:59,596
Speaker 0: Well, they would just leave those ones anyway, but the you know, there's this people who care but they're really worried about like preserving the physical object of the game and They really really enjoy.

936
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:20,612
Speaker 0: if you look at the games they prefer to buy right they are, you know Spent choosing to spend their money when they go to buy new games on games that have fancier nicer metal wood Components right and as shooing games that are just like, you know some cardboard I'd

937
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:21,275
Speaker 1: say it's even if

938
01:05:21,356 --> 01:05:22,642
Speaker 0: it's an amazing game for

939
01:05:22,703 --> 01:05:30,656
Speaker 1: that aspect is I see especially if you look at a lot of board game documentaries including the one going cardboard that we were featured in about alongside a bunch of other people.

940
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:35,403
Speaker 1: the Conversation in pop culture wouldn't like regular ass news media.

941
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:36,186
Speaker 1: Look at tabletop.

942
01:05:36,527 --> 01:05:38,909
Speaker 1: They often ask people Oh, how many games do you own?

943
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:45,473
Speaker 1: And if you look at a lot of these conversations people all a lot of these people tend to frame their conversations about games In terms of.

944
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:48,685
Speaker 1: I own a hundred and sixty seven tabletop games.

945
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:53,910
Speaker 0: My collection is this big Yep, and also people who are like, you know, what game should I buy?

946
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,959
Speaker 0: You know, the discussions are always like what do I buy?

947
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:57,204
Speaker 0: or I'm gonna.

948
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,550
Speaker 0: I have to call my collection.

949
01:05:58,651 --> 01:05:59,942
Speaker 0: What should I get rid of right?

950
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:00,870
Speaker 1: It's like, you know what?

951
01:06:02,412 --> 01:06:06,124
Speaker 0: How the things that we talk about which is how to win right?

952
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:07,770
Speaker 0: How is this game designed?

953
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,637
Speaker 0: Right, you know rules wise.

954
01:06:09,677 --> 01:06:11,125
Speaker 0: they're not having those discussions.

955
01:06:11,265 --> 01:06:15,357
Speaker 1: in those communities There's a big focus on having a like.

956
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,090
Speaker 1: how big is your collection of tabletop games?

957
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:32,158
Speaker 1: But then the posting photos of their board game shelves, right the subset of that though That actually really bothers me because it does impact the industry is the part that bothers me, too Yep, the people who buy games.

958
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:34,385
Speaker 1: This is primarily a problem on Kickstarter.

959
01:06:34,806 --> 01:06:45,780
Speaker 1: the Ghostbusters game I complain about a lot, but that was the tip of the iceberg like the floodgates opened after that games intellectual property that is popular and be kick-started.

960
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:55,690
Speaker 1: but it seems like the people who buy a lot of these games are buying them solely Either because they think they can resell the game after the Kickstarter because I don't think anyone's looking at reselling.

961
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:57,579
Speaker 1: Oh, I was poking around.

962
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:03,010
Speaker 1: I found some people talk a lot of Kickstarter games like this like even the Ghostbusters game.

963
01:07:03,572 --> 01:07:12,548
Speaker 1: They don't get resold after that and people are missing a component and we'll pay a lot for that component Like I guess oh the Kickstarter exclusive Slimer that kind of crap.

964
01:07:13,572 --> 01:07:15,119
Speaker 1: People think they'll make money from that.

965
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,103
Speaker 1: but they also.

966
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:21,442
Speaker 1: they kickstart the game Just to get the components and be able to say they have the game.

967
01:07:21,463 --> 01:07:27,850
Speaker 1: and if you look at reviews of these games People seem to focus almost entirely on the quality of those miniatures.

968
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:35,463
Speaker 1: It's almost like they're actually kick-starting the miniatures and the game Literally doesn't matter because I don't even need why even put rules.

969
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,310
Speaker 0: You're just selling physical objects, right?

970
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,649
Speaker 0: Like you might as well be selling action figures, right?

971
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:47,312
Speaker 0: And so the reason this bothers me is not is you know, it's like okay those people enjoying themselves spending their money Whoever they want.

972
01:07:47,373 --> 01:07:48,035
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

973
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:54,793
Speaker 0: but all of the companies that are at least nominally producing tabletop games right.

974
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:58,760
Speaker 0: Most of their money is coming from those people.

975
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:06,110
Speaker 0: if you were only had the people who cared about playing games buying games They board gaming would not be a large industry at all, right?

976
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:13,435
Speaker 1: So in one way parts of it would have exploded anyway, but the longer tale of games that like we like Well, I'm saying is it.

977
01:08:13,496 --> 01:08:16,370
Speaker 0: thankfully those people are propping up the industry with their money.

978
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:16,794
Speaker 0: So that's like.

979
01:08:16,874 --> 01:08:18,649
Speaker 0: that's a positive impact, right?

980
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:23,830
Speaker 0: But the negative impact is that in turn the industry caters to that interest, right?

981
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,462
Speaker 0: So the people producing games right?

982
01:08:26,622 --> 01:08:28,090
Speaker 0: are you know largely?

983
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:30,830
Speaker 0: especially if you look at Kickstarter.

984
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:40,131
Speaker 0: But a large chunk of the the board game tabletop industry are making games with fans focusing on fancy components, right You know.

985
01:08:40,474 --> 01:08:50,437
Speaker 0: big lots and lots of extra shit giant expensive boxes just full of goodies To appeal to that market and not Making quality games right.

986
01:08:50,537 --> 01:08:59,090
Speaker 0: even look at something like, you know, modern art, right an amazing game in a tiny box And all it is is what it's a pack of cards and some chips, right?

987
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:00,716
Speaker 0: You buy an old printing of this.

988
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:03,649
Speaker 0: it looks like garbage, but the game is just as amazing.

989
01:09:04,111 --> 01:09:10,127
Speaker 0: But like the newer version of the game comes with like a gavel for your auction and like a little cool.

990
01:09:10,269 --> 01:09:11,372
Speaker 1: That's neat Cool.

991
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:12,457
Speaker 0: it's cool and neat.

992
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:13,040
Speaker 0: I agree.

993
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,728
Speaker 1: There's no mechanic around that gavel.

994
01:09:14,808 --> 01:09:24,149
Speaker 0: Fuck you They're putting that there be if there wasn't that aspect to the industry of you know They're trying to sell that they're there.

995
01:09:24,532 --> 01:09:27,849
Speaker 0: They didn't put that gavel in there if they didn't think it's gonna help sell the game, right?

996
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:32,170
Speaker 0: And so, you know modern art, you know, the rules aren't any different.

997
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:43,550
Speaker 0: So at least the game isn't hurt by including the gavel, but people are making new games that are basically just you know Wooden gavel in a box with some, you know, nowhere where I'd make the distinction the game.

998
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:48,270
Speaker 1: There was definitely a discourse in the 90s and early 2000s around gimmicks in games like El Grande.

999
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:51,982
Speaker 1: Did it really need that giant king feast and that giant Castile?

1000
01:09:52,223 --> 01:09:54,029
Speaker 1: does camel up really need that?

1001
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,292
Speaker 1: Pyramid?

1002
01:09:55,593 --> 01:10:02,899
Speaker 1: the answers are those were gimmicky sure, but they were Mechanical gimmicks in the games themselves.

1003
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:04,724
Speaker 1: They were mechanically relevant to the game.

1004
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,128
Speaker 1: It's not like the.

1005
01:10:06,348 --> 01:10:08,655
Speaker 1: it's not like El Grande.

1006
01:10:08,695 --> 01:10:11,690
Speaker 1: came with a crown for whoever moved the king to where.

1007
01:10:12,753 --> 01:10:14,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it didn't and it was just a piece of wood.

1008
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:20,422
Speaker 0: It wasn't like, you know some fancy Sculpted thing that you know, we're obviously they're spending their.

1009
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:27,349
Speaker 0: the people producing the game are spending their time crafting the physical object rather than crafting the rules.

1010
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:35,862
Speaker 1: Now we do care about the quality of the components in the sense that to some extent yeah They don't not matter say some extent.

1011
01:10:35,922 --> 01:10:41,750
Speaker 1: but would you play Glory to Rome if the only version available was that clip art version?

1012
01:10:42,513 --> 01:10:45,603
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean, you know what I play glory to Rome even the new version.

1013
01:10:45,643 --> 01:10:56,015
Speaker 1: It's like occasionally, you know, but yeah Recordings of you saying that you would refuse to play the old version that the new version is objectively far superior Just because it looks better.

1014
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:57,682
Speaker 0: It is far superior.

1015
01:10:57,702 --> 01:10:59,489
Speaker 0: The old one is kind of hard to read.

1016
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,413
Speaker 0: it Makes it a little bit.

1017
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:08,219
Speaker 1: Oh, no you even even if it wasn't hard to read you went on at length about how it's so ugly She's gonna go technically that you would refuse to play it.

1018
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,343
Speaker 0: All right.

1019
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:11,150
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, I wouldn't choose to play it.

1020
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:16,080
Speaker 1: Their aesthetics matter like a game that looks better.

1021
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:16,883
Speaker 1: It does matter.

1022
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:18,348
Speaker 0: you can but also do.

1023
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,398
Speaker 0: the Game is important, but it's.

1024
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:23,625
Speaker 0: it's not like, you know, you're not.

1025
01:11:23,706 --> 01:11:25,070
Speaker 0: it's not the first thing you're doing here.

1026
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:34,141
Speaker 0: The first thing is to make a game that is fun to play and then you produce the components Appropriately right to suit the game that you have made.

1027
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:40,230
Speaker 0: if you're producing components first Right just to sell them to this segment of the market, right?

1028
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:45,679
Speaker 0: That's willing to pay and then your rules are just like a thing you do, you know, because it's a game I guess.

1029
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,692
Speaker 1: yep That's like.

1030
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:50,423
Speaker 1: I always hark back to that ghostbusters Kickstarter because they're all like that.

1031
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:56,690
Speaker 1: now where you look at some board game Kickstarter They highlight the quality of the components and like how they're gonna build the game and everything.

1032
01:11:57,031 --> 01:12:03,171
Speaker 0: Stretch goal even more minis drill metal coins stretch goal cloth maps, you know It's like.

1033
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,295
Speaker 0: I just bought oath.

1034
01:12:04,556 --> 01:12:08,428
Speaker 0: It has a mouse pad cloth ish, you know roll up map, but it's got.

1035
01:12:08,508 --> 01:12:09,391
Speaker 0: it came with metal I didn't.

1036
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:11,158
Speaker 0: I paid for the minimum level.

1037
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:16,835
Speaker 0: They gave me metal coins and you know fancy like rosin Books for the secrets.

1038
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:18,981
Speaker 1: I actually pointed out too.

1039
01:12:19,222 --> 01:12:21,730
Speaker 1: and then we can bring up the aesthetics of 18xx games.

1040
01:12:22,733 --> 01:12:27,030
Speaker 1: No, we can because the physical games often have a very like a beautifully printed board.

1041
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:32,710
Speaker 1: That's also hard to read because graphic design is definitely a passion for a lot of people who design 18xx games.

1042
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:43,950
Speaker 1: But the way we play them is on 18xx games net where here's some fucking yellow and green Hexagons with bright primary colors and a bunch of numbers everywhere.

1043
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:47,650
Speaker 0: Yep, it's like that's plenty of fun, right?

1044
01:12:48,112 --> 01:12:49,418
Speaker 0: The train game would not be.

1045
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:52,130
Speaker 0: have its fun improved with like little metal trains?

1046
01:12:52,257 --> 01:12:52,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1047
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:56,470
Speaker 1: But I guess if you I would want a suggestion to you because we've gone on long on this show is one.

1048
01:12:57,175 --> 01:13:03,423
Speaker 1: If you're gonna collect board games like that's cool But just make think about why you're collecting them and what you're doing with them.

1049
01:13:03,744 --> 01:13:05,550
Speaker 1: and please don't be that guy.

1050
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,094
Speaker 1: That's a gender-neutral term here.

1051
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:21,550
Speaker 0: But the that guy who brings up how many board games they own on asked Yeah, because that you're gonna just part of our community if you're gonna collect things, right You want to look at my thing of the day and you want to collect like Linda, right?

1052
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:32,270
Speaker 0: If you're not, you know regularly going into that collection room right with the children Right and going going wild and just having a ball with playing with all the awesome fun things you've collected, right?

1053
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:35,296
Speaker 0: Cuz they're fun toys Right, if you don't you got a cop a collection.

1054
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:43,388
Speaker 0: if you're not regularly going in and reading tons awesome comic books and sharing them Everybody right then in my opinion you're doing it wrong, right?

1055
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:45,768
Speaker 0: Either a try to make money.

1056
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:57,584
Speaker 1: You're just owning things which is consumerist and capitalist and therefore I'm really opposed to games I don't particularly like and don't play often that I did buy and keep.

1057
01:13:57,765 --> 01:13:58,406
Speaker 1: but there's that.

1058
01:13:58,647 --> 01:13:59,690
Speaker 1: there's one reason for that.

1059
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:06,410
Speaker 1: These are games that are not in print Do not appear to be likely to be in print again at any time in the future and if they came back into print and?

1060
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:11,821
Speaker 1: Were widely available I would get rid of my copies Mmm, like I remember like.

1061
01:14:11,962 --> 01:14:15,050
Speaker 0: if you're not gonna play them Why do you even need them if you're not gonna play them?

1062
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,449
Speaker 0: Why do you even need the out of print one?

1063
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:17,637
Speaker 1: Because I might play.

1064
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:23,910
Speaker 1: it has to be at least a game I would consider playing or a game that I want to preserve for some reason that I don't think is well preserved.

1065
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:25,834
Speaker 1: It's a rare case.

1066
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:26,898
Speaker 1: That's the point.

1067
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,885
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of games that need preserving there.

1068
01:14:29,206 --> 01:14:30,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was a little worried.

1069
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:35,430
Speaker 1: I didn't think a lot cheetah would ever get reprinted but lo and behold it got reprinted not that long ago.

1070
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean for example right the.

1071
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,988
Speaker 0: I guess the oldest rarest game I got is at 70s Dune.

1072
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:45,581
Speaker 0: I got you know before it was a thing I went on eBay and I picked one up and it's really got moved.

1073
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:47,307
Speaker 0: pretty much all the components complete.

1074
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:48,130
Speaker 0: ish, right?

1075
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,667
Speaker 0: It's not perfect mint conditioner, but we just fucking play it.

1076
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there there is a piece.

1077
01:14:52,844 --> 01:14:54,913
Speaker 0: It's not like I keep Preservation.

1078
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:57,405
Speaker 0: I would I hope that something came out with a new one.

1079
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:58,290
Speaker 0: I'll still play my old set.

1080
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:02,957
Speaker 1: But I'm saying I hope that people preserve Old physical versions of these games.

1081
01:15:02,977 --> 01:15:17,410
Speaker 1: because unlike a cartridge where the content of the cartridge is the same no matter what the cartridge is That's true a physical copy of a game From like the compassion in the year 2059. if someone has like oh this is what Puerto Rico looked like when it was first released.

1082
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:19,601
Speaker 1: Here's a physical copy you can interact with.

1083
01:15:20,104 --> 01:15:21,310
Speaker 1: that's important preservation.

1084
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:27,190
Speaker 1: It's harder and more important arguably for old tabletop games than it is for video games.

1085
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:32,949
Speaker 0: That's true, but also old tabletop games are generally you know well-preserved wherever they are.

1086
01:15:34,992 --> 01:15:36,878
Speaker 1: Some of them are hard to get because you know that was.

1087
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:39,265
Speaker 1: there was eras where no one thought to keep them.

1088
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:43,466
Speaker 0: I Mean yeah, the super old ones right are gonna be hard to get but it's like.

1089
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:50,070
Speaker 0: you know If you go to pack some plug they just got like vintage tabletop room.

1090
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,344
Speaker 0: It's like here you go play all these old games 60 70s here.

1091
01:15:53,364 --> 01:15:56,869
Speaker 0: They are play them go ahead They're not they're not a big deal.

1092
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:05,600
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
