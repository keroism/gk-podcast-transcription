1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,378
Speaker 1: It's Thursday January 6th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:11,981
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,225
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,690
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,432
Speaker 1: Tonight's oldness.

6
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:21,920
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:33,280
Speaker 1: So remember way back we saw that movie or we saw a trailer for it that was the, like, a smart engineer becomes a terrorist and fucks everything up for everybody?

8
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,388
Speaker 0: Uh, no, but...

9
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:36,153
Speaker 1: We've talked about the movie.

10
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:37,160
Speaker 0: We've talked about that idea.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talked about the movie, you know, we wondered if it would do it.

12
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,590
Speaker 1: It was, uh, I forget what the movie was called.

13
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,920
Speaker 1: I think it was Law Abiding Citizen.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,661
Speaker 1: Alright.

15
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:44,948
Speaker 1: So I watched it the other day.

16
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:45,490
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

17
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:46,677
Speaker 1: That is what it was.

18
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:50,536
Speaker 1: It was a smart guy who is an engineer becomes a terrorist.

19
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:51,280
Speaker 0: How about that?

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,505
Speaker 1: Not that good, though.

21
00:00:52,525 --> 00:01:00,125
Speaker 0: The thing is, I mean, it's actually a well-known fact that most real terrorists actually have engineering degrees, but they're not engineers.

22
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:01,091
Speaker 0: They're not good at it.

23
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:09,813
Speaker 1: Well, you're qualifying, though, because there's real terrorists as in the ones that plan big attacks and there's actual terrorists as in the guy that, like, their shoe was on fire or...

24
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:11,000
Speaker 0: They attacked the local embassy.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,561
Speaker 0: Yeah.

26
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:12,505
Speaker 0: Yeah.

27
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:15,860
Speaker 1: But basically the movie was, I don't know, it's not worth watching.

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,926
Speaker 1: It starts out really good.

29
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:21,691
Speaker 1: The guy does the kind of smart things you'd expect an engineer to do if he wanted to be a terrorist.

30
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:26,474
Speaker 1: But step one, he got a little implausible at the end with the robot rocket launcher.

31
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:27,720
Speaker 0: Alright, implausible.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,230
Speaker 1: And tunneling into solitary confinement.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,033
Speaker 1: Implausible.

34
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:38,570
Speaker 1: And the fact that after he murders, like, a bunch of judges and things, the feds don't just step in and the CIA doesn't just, like, kill him.

35
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:39,495
Speaker 0: Implausible.

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,542
Speaker 1: Because they have him in jail.

37
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:41,368
Speaker 1: They know who he is.

38
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:42,476
Speaker 1: They could just kill him and they don't.

39
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:42,900
Speaker 0: They would.

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,983
Speaker 1: And it gets to the point where he's going to blow up, like, the entire city of Philadelphia.

41
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,008
Speaker 0: That's not possible.

42
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,457
Speaker 1: Well, possible, but who cares?

43
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:51,040
Speaker 0: Incredibly.

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,532
Speaker 0: Encouraged, but incredibly difficult.

45
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,647
Speaker 0: That's like those guys, like, I'm going to poison the water supply.

46
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:57,613
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, no, you're not.

47
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:58,439
Speaker 1: Like, it was obvious.

48
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,195
Speaker 1: He puts car bombs everywhere and stuff like that.

49
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:02,461
Speaker 1: But then it just gets a little dumb.

50
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:02,783
Speaker 0: Yeah.

51
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:05,596
Speaker 0: There's no way one guy could put car bombs everywhere.

52
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:08,388
Speaker 1: One guy, well, one guy could do a lot of what he did.

53
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:18,937
Speaker 1: But the way the movie played out, real government people, because the shtick was, I'm spoiling this whole movie because it sucks, was that it turns out what he was, he was an engineer, right?

54
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,965
Speaker 1: He was an engineer for the CIA.

55
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:26,705
Speaker 1: And his job was low-touch assassinations, like tiny bomb and a cell phone kind of thing.

56
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:33,980
Speaker 1: So the CIA tips off the cops, but the CIA doesn't just kill this guy after he's murdered, like, ten government officials.

57
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:43,660
Speaker 1: So basically, it was plausible in every regard, except the fact that, one, nobody noticed the goddamn rocket launcher robot hanging out in the cemetery.

58
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,151
Speaker 0: See, you know, the thing is, like, if someone like me, it would be a situation where, like, it was a terrorism.

59
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,197
Speaker 0: They don't know who did it.

60
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:52,765
Speaker 0: There was incredible amounts of damage.

61
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:56,705
Speaker 0: You know, that's the kind of terrorism you would have of really smart people.

62
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:57,932
Speaker 0: You would never know who it was.

63
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:06,841
Speaker 1: Well, if they want to make a good movie along these lines, because basically the movie was trying to make this, like, a plausible reason for him to be that pissed off and also be a smart person.

64
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:14,399
Speaker 1: And it really, basically his wife and his daughter get, like, raped and murdered in front of him, and then the people who do it get away with it.

65
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:15,360
Speaker 0: All right.

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,500
Speaker 1: So, yeah, but I feel like someone should make the same movie, but it's basically anonymous that starts attacking people.

67
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,449
Speaker 0: Eh, I don't know.

68
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,060
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a good movie there at all.

69
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,619
Speaker 1: I think there is, Smart Terrorist.

70
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:27,358
Speaker 0: No.

71
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,620
Speaker 1: You don't think there's a movie about smart terrorists?

72
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:30,073
Speaker 0: No.

73
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,358
Speaker 1: This is James Bond, but you get to watch the bad guy?

74
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,137
Speaker 0: That would be a different story.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,219
Speaker 0: Because at the end, James Bond comes in and blows him away.

76
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:43,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I was at work today, and apparently he's doing construction on the floor above us.

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,520
Speaker 1: You know, they're doing masonry work again on my building.

78
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,680
Speaker 0: So, all I heard all day was sawing of wood.

79
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,714
Speaker 1: Oh, every 20 minutes today, I hear...

80
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,340
Speaker 0: And then, of course, a guy drops a whole bunch of two-by-fours on the floor.

81
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,680
Speaker 0: And then... It's like, all day long, from the morning till the night.

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,657
Speaker 0: It was the worst.

83
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:09,459
Speaker 1: I can think of worse things.

84
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I want to try something new for a Thursday, right?

85
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,419
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

86
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:14,540
Speaker 0: Because I got no news.

87
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,558
Speaker 1: I got something new, too.

88
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,200
Speaker 0: I got news, but it's all Monday news because CES is going on right now.

89
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,457
Speaker 0: But anyway, I was thinking, what if, right, you know, I geek-bited a book?

90
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:29,740
Speaker 0: It's not a book that's ever going to be book club, but I read it, so it might as well geek-bite, right?

91
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:30,118
Speaker 0: No.

92
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:31,240
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

93
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
Speaker 0: So, I'm going to do that right now.

94
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:36,400
Speaker 0: I read Lachlanra book two, which I know you have also read.

95
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,299
Speaker 1: Let's not spoil it, but you know what?

96
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:39,460
Speaker 1: It was more of the same.

97
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,700
Speaker 1: I think he's a slightly better author in the second book.

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,340
Speaker 1: Like, he's learned.

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:51,799
Speaker 0: He definitely has more writing skills, but I think because you already know the characters and it's a sequel and the pirate part drags out a little bit long...

100
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,520
Speaker 1: The pirate part becomes, basically, the book.

101
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:55,117
Speaker 0: Yeah.

102
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,760
Speaker 0: You know, I wish there was less pirate chapters, you know, even though...

103
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,860
Speaker 1: He has a little too much of a tendency to kill every goddamn character.

104
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:01,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, that too.

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,920
Speaker 0: Well, I think he wants to, he's basically doing the superhero thing, right?

106
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,000
Speaker 0: He wants to return to as much status quo as possible at the end, so he can start...

107
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,340
Speaker 1: Except the status quo of the first book you can't go back to because he killed everybody.

108
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,780
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but the status quo that was established at the end of the first book is the same status quo that was established at the end of the second book.

109
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:23,400
Speaker 0: So, every book will end with the same status quo.

110
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:23,960
Speaker 1: Maybe.

111
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:27,360
Speaker 0: Maybe not the final final book, but every other book in between.

112
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,540
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, you know, if you like the first one, the second one is more of the same.

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,580
Speaker 1: It is way up your alley.

114
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,100
Speaker 0: Also, if you didn't like the first one, then don't read the second one.

115
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:47,799
Speaker 1: Nope, but if you did not read the first one yet, the second one, for me at least, is proof that the first one's worth reading because the second one might be worth reading for you.

116
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's...

117
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,660
Speaker 1: It's not a Hyperion situation.

118
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:52,499
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

119
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,020
Speaker 0: It's not.

120
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,676
Speaker 0: It's definitely not.

121
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,458
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, it's fun, thieving and pirating, and the whole time you're like, "What are they going to do?

122
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,070
Speaker 0: What are they going to

123
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:00,377
Speaker 0: do?".

124
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,099
Speaker 0: And then, oh my God, you see what they do.

125
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Speaker 1: There's a pretty good moment of comeuppance.

126
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:06,280
Speaker 0: It doesn't leave anything unresolved.

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,729
Speaker 0: Once you finish the book, everything that was started in that book will end in that book.

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,378
Speaker 0: You're not left hanging for a future book for any of the plot points.

129
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:15,536
Speaker 1: I do.

130
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,339
Speaker 1: The whole book, I was trying to figure out what their angle was, what the original heist was going to be, and I did not figure it out at any point.

131
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,300
Speaker 1: I got hints with the rappelling thing.

132
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,417
Speaker 1: I was like, "All right, I think they're going to go out the

133
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:29,740
Speaker 1: window.".

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,480
Speaker 0: I mean, I figured it out once they used the cement.

135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,697
Speaker 0: I was like, "All right, there's nothing to do except the only things that they have described that they could possibly be heisting are these

136
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:40,119
Speaker 0: things.".

137
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,680
Speaker 0: And then it was those things, and I was like, "Oh, really?

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:42,883
Speaker 0: That's

139
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:43,192
Speaker 0: lame.".

140
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:45,480
Speaker 1: But then again, that's a pretty good con.

141
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:46,898
Speaker 0: It's not the worst, but...

142
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,020
Speaker 1: Just remember, they were in this for fun, mostly.

143
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:49,719
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,480
Speaker 0: The thing is that they were in it for fun.

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,180
Speaker 0: I don't know why they just didn't stick to their gambling situation, which was way more interesting than the pirate situation.

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,360
Speaker 1: Well, I think they had the Lupin situation, where once you've stolen everything and you're rich, you're bored.

147
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,136
Speaker 1: So what do you do?

148
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:05,038
Speaker 1: Steal.

149
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:05,817
Speaker 0: Yup.

150
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,359
Speaker 1: That's basically it.

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,500
Speaker 0: And of course, they also had the Kabi-Bewab situation, where you never actually get away with something big, so you always need money again.

152
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:21,819
Speaker 0: It's like, "Why can't we get a story where the rich guy, the thief, actually makes off with the big gold, and he's super rich all the

153
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:21,920
Speaker 0: time?".

154
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,780
Speaker 1: I have a counter example.

155
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:26,620
Speaker 1: In the first book, they're richer than probably anyone.

156
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,259
Speaker 0: No, I think that you gotta look...

157
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,720
Speaker 1: They already had all the money they could ever use.

158
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what we need is we need to go...

159
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,019
Speaker 1: And they tried to steal more.

160
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,760
Speaker 0: We gotta read about Lupin I. I have a feeling that Lupin I... Or Saint Lupin.

161
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,420
Speaker 0: He was the one who was mad loaded all the time.

162
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:40,879
Speaker 0: It's French.

163
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,600
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's a translation.

164
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,086
Speaker 0: Yup.

165
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:44,400
Speaker 0: I got a feeling.

166
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,513
Speaker 0: I don't know.

167
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,940
Speaker 1: I feel like I get a lot of the same stuff I would get from our Saint Lupin book from watching the Layton movie.

168
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:51,900
Speaker 0: Maybe.

169
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,580
Speaker 1: Minus puzzles.

170
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,400
Speaker 1: Minus thieving.

171
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,099
Speaker 0: I didn't watch that Layton movie.

172
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:55,820
Speaker 1: It was okay.

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,755
Speaker 1: I think I geek-bit it.

174
00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:58,680
Speaker 0: Possibly.

175
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:06,139
Speaker 1: So in homage and honor to the topic we're gonna do tonight, I found an article, tried my Thursday thing, related to that.

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:27,183
Speaker 1: It turns out there is, of all the indicators of how long you have left to live once you're already old, like once you're 50/60, there's one that has been found, and this is one of many recent studies, but this one's pretty damn conclusive, that is the best indicator of how long you will live after you hit like 65/75.

177
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,639
Speaker 1: How fast you walk.

178
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,318
Speaker 0: I walk real fast.

179
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,179
Speaker 1: If you just take an old person- Is faster better or worse?

180
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,380
Speaker 1: The faster you walk, the longer you live.

181
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,520
Speaker 0: Oh man, I'm gonna be like a zillion years old.

182
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:38,980
Speaker 1: It's a straight linear thing.

183
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:45,305
Speaker 0: Now is it just how fast you naturally walk, or can you intentionally speed up to live longer?

184
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Speaker 1: So the article, I recommend you all read it, and some follow-up stuff.

185
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,300
Speaker 0: What if I have longer legs, but I take less steps per second?

186
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Speaker 0: Is it steps per second, or is it meters per second?

187
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,058
Speaker 1: I don't know.

188
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,219
Speaker 0: That matters a lot.

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,560
Speaker 1: So the deal is, specifically for people who are over 75, walking speed is a straight correlation.

190
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:08,960
Speaker 1: Like a mile per hour is another X years of life, and it's pretty damn accurate.

191
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,440
Speaker 0: I'm never gonna be in the walker, I'm just gonna keep walking fast as long as possible.

192
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,340
Speaker 1: And canes, walkers, anything you've got doesn't matter.

193
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,700
Speaker 1: It's just how fast you ambulate when you walk normally.

194
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,420
Speaker 0: Walking is called ambulating?

195
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:21,395
Speaker 1: Yes.

196
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:22,340
Speaker 0: I did not know that.

197
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:22,940
Speaker 1: Ambulation.

198
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,619
Speaker 0: I thought ambulance.

199
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,079
Speaker 0: For example- I thought ambulation was going to the doctor.

200
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,519
Speaker 1: If you are ambulatory.

201
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that meant that you were in transport to a doctor.

202
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,639
Speaker 1: It means you can move yourself about under your own power.

203
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,319
Speaker 0: Oh, well, that's new to me.

204
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,320
Speaker 0: Guy in a walker, guy in a cane- I had the wrong definition of that word.

205
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,000
Speaker 1: They didn't however use wheelchair people.

206
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,135
Speaker 1: They didn't want to deal with that.

207
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if a guy's way fast in his wheelchair?

208
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:59,360
Speaker 1: But for example, from the article, blah, blah, blah, blah, those who walked one meter per second, about 2.25 miles an hour or faster, consistently and significantly lived longer than others of their age and sex who walked more slowly.

209
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,390
Speaker 1: I wonder, this is just way out there.

210
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:15,318
Speaker 1: speculation, I'm not going to argue there's any causation here, but New York City has, from many studies, the highest average walking speed in America, if not the world.

211
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:19,180
Speaker 1: New York City has one of the highest life expectancies in America.

212
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:29,539
Speaker 1: They said that there is a small correlation that if you walk slowly and you try to walk faster on a regular basis, that you will live longer.

213
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,560
Speaker 1: But that is not nearly as strong and requires much more study to prove.

214
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:40,299
Speaker 1: But they argued that if you're trying to walk faster, you're probably exercising, you're probably getting yourself into better health.

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,220
Speaker 1: And there's all these side arguments that it might have to do with outlook.

216
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:56,618
Speaker 1: People who walk faster tend to have places to go, they tend to not be in a lot of extreme pain or they're in extreme pain, but they want to be where they're going more than they want to deal with the pain.

217
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,278
Speaker 1: They're willing to put up with it.

218
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,920
Speaker 1: Also, just like hips and joints and heart, everything goes into walking.

219
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,959
Speaker 1: So I thought it was a neat thing.

220
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:12,454
Speaker 1: So today on the treadmill, I determined that my average walking pace, like out in the street if I'm just walking somewhere, is between 4.6 and 4.7 miles an hour.

221
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,100
Speaker 1: My maximum walking speed, like if I'm in a hurry and I'm not going to run-.

222
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,159
Speaker 0: Well, I walk the same as you because you don't get away from me.

223
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's 5.1 miles an hour.

224
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,660
Speaker 1: That is as fast as I walk unless I power walk, which I don't power walk down the street.

225
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, power walking is dorky.

226
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,860
Speaker 1: It's fast, but as we learned from Will He Run, you run when you got to go somewhere.

227
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,980
Speaker 0: So this would normally be a Wednesday kind of thing of the day.

228
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,220
Speaker 0: We're doing things of the day now, right?

229
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,444
Speaker 0: No.

230
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,880
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're doing things of the day.

231
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,020
Speaker 0: All right, now we're doing things of the day.

232
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,120
Speaker 0: So this would normally be a Wednesday thing of the day, right?

233
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,039
Speaker 0: I don't know if you remember.

234
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:03,638
Speaker 0: Probably one of the most ancient things of the day, if it was even a thing of the day, is the website miotd.com, which is mechaimageoftheday.com, which is actually- Ah, very good website.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,660
Speaker 0: A website that continues to go with a mecha image every single day.

236
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,660
Speaker 1: Whoa, I haven't checked it in like two years.

237
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,208
Speaker 0: You've probably got 720 some odd mecha images that you can observe.

238
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,139
Speaker 0: This is a similar site, right?

239
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,177
Speaker 0: It doesn't have one every day, right?

240
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,540
Speaker 0: But it has quite a few in its archive.

241
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,200
Speaker 0: It's only been going for a few months.

242
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:32,420
Speaker 0: It's been going since late August, and each month it has quite a sampling.

243
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,820
Speaker 0: So the website is Fe, Yes, Vintage Manga, and it's mostly single scanned.

244
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,820
Speaker 0: It's not scans of the whole manga, right?

245
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,360
Speaker 0: It's like, here's the cover, or here's an inside page of vintage shoujo mangas.

246
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:53,820
Speaker 0: And you can see there are many pictures of crazy old mangas here.

247
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,005
Speaker 0: Yeah.

248
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:58,319
Speaker 1: I want to read every one of those as far as I can see.

249
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:02,580
Speaker 0: I know, they're all girly mangas, but the point is- Yeah, yeah, you know what else was a girly manga?

250
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,699
Speaker 1: Half the manga we like.

251
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm just saying, I probably don't want to read all of these.

252
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,879
Speaker 0: I didn't say I don't want to read any.

253
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:08,919
Speaker 0: I said I don't want to read all.

254
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,228
Speaker 0: Many.

255
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

256
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,839
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, mad interesting pictures to be looking at.

257
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,720
Speaker 0: And also here's something that appears to be somewhat Russian.

258
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,499
Speaker 0: Disco Churin Potau.

259
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,760
Speaker 1: That looks like a real person.

260
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:21,616
Speaker 0: It is.

261
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:23,599
Speaker 0: I don't know what's up with that.

262
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,178
Speaker 0: I'm worried.

263
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,360
Speaker 0: But yeah, lots of cool things to see here.

264
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,178
Speaker 0: It's a thing of the day.

265
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,780
Speaker 1: So the Commonwealth of Virginia has done something- You mean the state of Virginia?

266
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,060
Speaker 1: They're a commonwealth.

267
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,200
Speaker 1: Just like I think Ohio's a commonwealth, I forget.

268
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,180
Speaker 0: So they're not, yeah, okay.

269
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:42,397
Speaker 1: Basically, commonwealth means we're a state, but we call stuff different stuff for no good reason.

270
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,059
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

271
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,980
Speaker 1: But no, Ohio isn't actually a state, remember?

272
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:46,519
Speaker 0: That's right.

273
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,720
Speaker 0: So- That's why you don't have to pay taxes.

274
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,379
Speaker 1: The Commonwealth of Virginia's Department of Motor Vehicles are asshole killjoys.

275
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,620
Speaker 1: They have ruined one of the two great wonders of the license plate world.

276
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,454
Speaker 1: The first wonder of the license plate world, as you all know, is the famous Florida license plate that says, "Ass

277
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:05,917
Speaker 1: Orgy."

278
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:06,700
Speaker 1: Yep.

279
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:22,759
Speaker 1: Now, it actually said A55RJY, but the new Florida license plate had a big circular orange in the middle, and someone clever made an epic license plate that made it past the censors, until one dude complained about it, and then they revoked it.

280
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:23,817
Speaker 0: Assholes.

281
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,460
Speaker 1: So Virginia, there's the second most famous license plate ever, of course not counting-.

282
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,000
Speaker 0: How come someone hasn't tried to make a free speech case out of this?

283
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,420
Speaker 0: I'm expressing myself through my license plate number.

284
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:43,680
Speaker 1: So the argument is that you can do that with a bumper sticker, and that the state cannot condone on its own, it can choose not to condone obscene language.

285
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,660
Speaker 1: But you're allowed to put a bumper sticker that says, "Fuck" or "Ass Orgy" on your car.

286
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,734
Speaker 1: You just can't get the state to have a license plate.

287
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:50,259
Speaker 1: that does that.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,679
Speaker 1: But why- And you know how they get around it?

289
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,321
Speaker 1: They don't.

290
00:14:54,422 --> 00:15:02,718
Speaker 1: actually, while they say, "Oh, we'll revoke obscene ones," usually the code says, "We have the right to deny or revoke any license plate at any time for any

291
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:03,019
Speaker 1: reason.".

292
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:06,160
Speaker 0: So just someone decides arbitrarily.

293
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but really, they only do it when people complain, and they really avoid any- I mean, I was trying to get my vanity plate when I was a kid in high school.

294
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,159
Speaker 1: They denied the first 20 things I told them.

295
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,277
Speaker 1: Half of them were deemed obscene, and half of them, they wouldn't tell me why they denied them.

296
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:27,060
Speaker 1: I ended up on Arcadia, because that was the bottom of my list, and I was running out of patience.

297
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,740
Speaker 0: All right.

298
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,400
Speaker 1: So I couldn't get Arboria, by the way.

299
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:31,060
Speaker 0: Why not?

300
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,817
Speaker 1: They wouldn't tell me why.

301
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,100
Speaker 0: Okay.

302
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,160
Speaker 1: Because Arboria I figure is more fun than Arcadia.

303
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:41,496
Speaker 1: Someone in Virginia had a famous license plate that is simply E-A-T-T-H-E, Eat The.

304
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:45,080
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen a Virginia license plate?

305
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,440
Speaker 0: Does it have a V in the middle?

306
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,246
Speaker 1: So Eat The.

307
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 1: on this license plate, it says Virginia at the top in crayons.

308
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,157
Speaker 1: On the left are two red, bloody-looking handprints, and on the bottom says, "Kids

309
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:58,638
Speaker 1: first.".

310
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:00,839
Speaker 0: Oh, Virginia, eat the kids first.

311
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:01,275
Speaker 0: Yes.

312
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:08,740
Speaker 0: That sounds like, no, I think what that is, if it says kids first, that's probably one of those special ones.

313
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,849
Speaker 0: Yes.

314
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,440
Speaker 0: Right?

315
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:11,939
Speaker 0: Like in New York, you can get the pet swan.

316
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,307
Speaker 0: Yes.

317
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,940
Speaker 0: You can get any, you can get Rangers or Mets or Giants.

318
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,800
Speaker 1: But no, in Virginia here, we got eat the kids first with two bloody handprints.

319
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,440
Speaker 1: And the DMV sent a letter to the guy who has it.

320
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,820
Speaker 1: The letter is posted, basically saying, "Yeah, we received a complaint about your license plate, and it is hereby revoked.

321
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,124
Speaker 1: Fuck

322
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:29,287
Speaker 1: you.".

323
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:31,200
Speaker 0: Just keep driving with it.

324
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:31,958
Speaker 0: What are they going to do?

325
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,460
Speaker 1: Suspend his license?

326
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,098
Speaker 0: Only if he ever gets pulled over.

327
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:40,520
Speaker 1: Basically, you realize cops look up every license plate they see all the time.

328
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,200
Speaker 0: And then, well, I mean, you can at least keep it until your registration goes out, because they're going to- They can just take it right then.

329
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,659
Speaker 1: They can demand he give it back.

330
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,560
Speaker 0: They have to physically come and take it from you, though.

331
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:50,098
Speaker 1: You know what?

332
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,680
Speaker 1: All I would do if I were him is take a picture of me holding it to prove that it was mine.

333
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:56,279
Speaker 1: I feel for you, dude.

334
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:57,280
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

335
00:16:58,648 --> 00:16:59,180
Speaker 1: Fuck Virginia.

336
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:00,399
Speaker 0: That's right.

337
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,919
Speaker 1: So we got a meta moment, really quick.

338
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 1: There will probably be one or two more Geek Nights episodes before MAGFest.

339
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:07,380
Speaker 1: I think one.

340
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,479
Speaker 1: Maybe two.

341
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,819
Speaker 1: We might have an episode to put up.

342
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:10,128
Speaker 1: Yeah.

343
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,839
Speaker 0: MAGFest is next week, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, four days of insane awesomeness.

344
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,259
Speaker 1: January 13th through 16th, 2011, Thursday through Sunday in Alexandria, Virginia, in the middle of fuck nowhere at a hotel.

345
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:30,300
Speaker 0: But if you go to YouTube, to the MAGFest channel, you can see awesome commercials that will convince you to go to MAGFest.

346
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,638
Speaker 1: You should go to MAGFest or- MAGFest!

347
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:38,340
Speaker 0: I haven't even been there, but I already feel the MAGFest.

348
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:43,171
Speaker 1: Not only that, many of our listeners see us at conventions, and you want to hang out with us.

349
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:45,820
Speaker 1: Usually, we brush you off.

350
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,678
Speaker 1: No offense to you.

351
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,820
Speaker 1: It's basically we're busy.

352
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,959
Speaker 0: Brim, we'll brush you off.

353
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, you will also brush people off.

354
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,800
Speaker 0: Although I brushed off that was not a fanboy or a fangirl.

355
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:55,599
Speaker 1: Or a crowd.

356
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
Speaker 1: The crowd's the biggest thing.

357
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,220
Speaker 1: People don't know where we are, and then we do a panel.

358
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,840
Speaker 1: All our listeners come to the panel or hang out outside the panel, and then we have a mob and we usually have to hide in the room until most of you go away.

359
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:13,280
Speaker 0: If you want to actually talk to us, you're much better off coming up when there's no one else there and using your balls.

360
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:14,319
Speaker 1: Of steel.

361
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,777
Speaker 0: Yes.

362
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:21,079
Speaker 1: But at MAGFest, we only have one lecture, and we're sitting on two additional panels in the MAG9.

363
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,360
Speaker 0: Actual panel panels, not lectures or presentations.

364
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,660
Speaker 1: The entire rest of this convention, I plan to alternate between drinking, sleeping, and playing board games.

365
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,858
Speaker 0: I'm playing so many games.

366
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,699
Speaker 0: Playing all the games.

367
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:33,600
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

368
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:34,920
Speaker 1: Half the crew's going to be there.

369
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,359
Speaker 0: If it's a game, I'm playing it.

370
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,586
Speaker 1: Also, our friend John St.

371
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:40,999
Speaker 1: John's going to be there, and James Rolf, who I've talked to once or twice.

372
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:42,639
Speaker 1: Cool people.

373
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:44,259
Speaker 1: The angry video game nerd and such.

374
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:46,300
Speaker 1: Losing should be fun.

375
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,880
Speaker 1: Technical changes in game design and achievements and metagaming.

376
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,180
Speaker 1: MAGFest will also be at PAX East, but that's a ways away.

377
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,100
Speaker 1: This weekend, actually tomorrow, Friday, NerdNYC board game night.

378
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,679
Speaker 1: Next Friday and Saturday, NerdNYC recess.

379
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,980
Speaker 1: Details online.

380
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,618
Speaker 1: I will link to them.

381
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,259
Speaker 0: Anything else can wait.

382
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:06,380
Speaker 0: Oh, and the book club selection.

383
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,580
Speaker 1: Michio Kaku's Hyperspace, a book about 10 dimensions and stuff.

384
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:13,620
Speaker 0: Not 11 dimensions?

385
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,320
Speaker 1: Well, 10 plus time, I think.

386
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:16,041
Speaker 1: I think it's 10.

387
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:16,594
Speaker 0: Not 9 dimensions?

388
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:20,260
Speaker 1: As I recall, it is 10 spatial dimensions plus time.

389
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,920
Speaker 0: Not 13 dimensions?

390
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,300
Speaker 0: No, specifically 10.

391
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,182
Speaker 0: How do you know exactly 10?

392
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:26,160
Speaker 1: Because the math works.

393
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,659
Speaker 1: With 9, the math doesn't work.

394
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,100
Speaker 1: With 11, the math doesn't work.

395
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,920
Speaker 1: With 10, it's predictive, theoretically.

396
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,200
Speaker 0: Theoretically?

397
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:45,939
Speaker 1: Basically, it is a layman's introduction to string theory in terms of what it actually implies if it's true and what the actual evidence is for it.

398
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,739
Speaker 1: It's one of those things like, "All right, if this is true, then you know what?

399
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:52,580
Speaker 1: There's all these universes and dimensions, and here's what that means.

400
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:52,924
Speaker 1: Holy

401
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:53,168
Speaker 1: shit.".

402
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,200
Speaker 0: Check out this animated gif of a hockey guy eating a waffle and then drinking some syrup.

403
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:57,719
Speaker 1: I've seen that.

404
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,660
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good thing that the listeners cannot see.

405
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,780
Speaker 1: In fact, we don't even have a Ustream anymore.

406
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,179
Speaker 1: There's no way for them to see that.

407
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:03,779
Speaker 0: All right.

408
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,960
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm pushing 30.

409
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,477
Speaker 1: I'm getting old.

410
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,918
Speaker 1: You are old.

411
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,019
Speaker 1: Scott's getting old.

412
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,960
Speaker 1: We're both feeling the effects.

413
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,559
Speaker 1: I'm not old.

414
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,278
Speaker 0: Only you're old.

415
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,977
Speaker 1: I'm getting old.

416
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,678
Speaker 0: I'm not old.

417
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,119
Speaker 1: You are less than a year younger than me.

418
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:16,380
Speaker 0: I'm less old.

419
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,981
Speaker 1: Captain 1982.

420
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,459
Speaker 0: Am I not less old?

421
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,100
Speaker 1: Do I not have ... Do I have to go low blow here?

422
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:22,799
Speaker 1: I got more hair.

423
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:23,738
Speaker 0: That's all right.

424
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,401
Speaker 0: Hair has nothing to do ... In all ...

425
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:25,919
Speaker 1: In all places.

426
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,879
Speaker 0: Babies.

427
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,680
Speaker 0: Babies have no hair, but you know what?

428
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:29,698
Speaker 0: They're less old.

429
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,118
Speaker 1: Also, I posit ... I'm closer to baby.

430
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,800
Speaker 1: I posit that, yes, you are very much closer to babydom.

431
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,699
Speaker 1: That's right.

432
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:45,132
Speaker 1: However, you have ... While you are not old of body, you are definitely old of attitude in some ways, Mr.

433
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:46,380
Speaker 1: Crotchety old man.

434
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:47,020
Speaker 1: Who is not?

435
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:47,485
Speaker 1: Mr.

436
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 1: "Eh, I've done that before.

437
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,149
Speaker 1: I don't need to do it

438
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,515
Speaker 1: again.".

439
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,920
Speaker 0: Who on this earth is not crotchety in a way or two or old-fashioned in a way or two?

440
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
Speaker 1: Carl Sagan had no point in his life was crotchety.

441
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:08,040
Speaker 0: Everybody inherits something from their parents, and because your parents are older from you than you, everyone is old-fashioned in some way.

442
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,120
Speaker 1: Scott, for example, I inherited my dad's face.

443
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,619
Speaker 1: I inherited my mom's eyes.

444
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,760
Speaker 1: You apparently inherited your dad's, "Eh, Mila, get in the car.

445
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,216
Speaker 1: Let's go.

446
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,560
Speaker 0: Let's get out of here.

447
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's because I walk so fast, I'm in a hurry.

448
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:22,979
Speaker 0: That's why I'm going to live to be a lot older than you.

449
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:24,179
Speaker 1: You inherited old.

450
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:25,200
Speaker 0: Okay.

451
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,020
Speaker 1: Seriously, Scott's dad, his parents will come to visit us, and we'll be hanging out.

452
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,400
Speaker 0: Is this show about being old, or is this show about Scott?

453
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:32,419
Speaker 1: Five minutes.

454
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,239
Speaker 1: His dad's like, "We're going to go yet.

455
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,919
Speaker 1: We're going to have some food.

456
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:37,413
Speaker 0: There's the game

457
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:37,474
Speaker 0: on.".

458
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:38,115
Speaker 0: All right.

459
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:49,996
Speaker 1: Scott, you're the only one in the crew where when someone is mimicking the voice of someone else, it is pretty much just, "Eh, eh,

460
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:50,799
Speaker 1: eh.".

461
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:53,760
Speaker 1: Get off my metaphorical gaming lawn.

462
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,498
Speaker 0: That's right, punk kids.

463
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:56,780
Speaker 1: We are getting old though.

464
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,237
Speaker 1: I mean, I realized that when I turn 30, I have at most everything.

465
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,098
Speaker 1: I just did two more times, and then I'll die.

466
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,379
Speaker 0: Pretty much, but you know what?

467
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:09,020
Speaker 0: I'm betting on advanced technologies, because think about it, right?

468
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 1: I saw an article saying that one in five people who are alive today will reach 100.

469
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but think about this, right?

470
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:18,880
Speaker 0: Our grandparents, when they were 30, it was like what?

471
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,919
Speaker 0: The '50s maybe, the '40s of the '50s, and the life expectancy then was what?

472
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:26,835
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

473
00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:29,860
Speaker 1: I didn't look up any research for the show.

474
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,719
Speaker 0: It was not much.

475
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:35,240
Speaker 0: The life expectancy has gone way up over the course of their lifetime.

476
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:57,160
Speaker 1: I've also read a lot of studies and things talking about the fact that the life expectancy of humans who survive, apparently from like 45, 50 to like 65, that's the danger zone where if you don't die then, you're probably going to make it to 80, maybe 90, but if you die right then, it's pretty much just genetics or bad lifestyle.

477
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:09,661
Speaker 1: Even in the old days, a lot of people in ancient times would live to be 70, 80, but most people died when they were one, or when they were 20, or when they were 50.

478
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:13,457
Speaker 1: Medicine only gets you so far if you're a fat ass, or if you just get bad genes, bad heart.

479
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,499
Speaker 0: You know what?

480
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,560
Speaker 0: I go to the doctor, and the doctor say, "You are in the flawless health.

481
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:20,040
Speaker 0: I predict I will be around very long.

482
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,850
Speaker 0: There will be many geek

483
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,175
Speaker 0: nights.".

484
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:22,460
Speaker 1: That is the trouble.

485
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,920
Speaker 1: You're pretty much guaranteed to have your doctor.

486
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,600
Speaker 0: Although, it may eventually become geek night.

487
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:27,819
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to outlive you.

488
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, you wish.

489
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,238
Speaker 1: Well, see, it's complicated by the fact that I'm much more- You don't walk as fast as me.

490
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:33,940
Speaker 1: Are you kidding?

491
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,540
Speaker 1: We just agreed that we walk at the same speed.

492
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,958
Speaker 1: And you- You can't run as fast as me.

493
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:40,780
Speaker 0: You went to the doctor.

494
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,519
Speaker 0: He's always got bad stuff to say.

495
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:43,559
Speaker 0: Like what?

496
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,960
Speaker 0: You got allergies and shit.

497
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,000
Speaker 0: You're always coughing up nasty phlegm.

498
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:47,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got allergies.

499
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got all kinds of illnesses over there.

500
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,659
Speaker 1: No, I've got allergies.

501
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:52,919
Speaker 1: That doesn't correlate with life.

502
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,539
Speaker 0: You'll be dead next year.

503
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,799
Speaker 0: You'll be dead before the iPhone comes to Verizon.

504
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,660
Speaker 1: I probably will be dead before the iPhone comes to Verizon.

505
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,300
Speaker 0: Because it happens.

506
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,970
Speaker 1: I'll bet you 500 bucks.

507
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,340
Speaker 1: it's not within the next three weeks.

508
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,059
Speaker 0: No way.

509
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,720
Speaker 0: So now, you're only going three weeks.

510
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,181
Speaker 0: You originally were saying 2012.

511
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:11,872
Speaker 0: Why don't you extend that bet to be 365 days?

512
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:14,208
Speaker 0: 500 bucks?

513
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, 365 days.

514
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,400
Speaker 1: No, but are you going to- because you never bet.

515
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:20,380
Speaker 1: You never bet on anything.

516
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,639
Speaker 0: There's very strong evidence this time.

517
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:24,899
Speaker 0: I bet when I'm not sure.

518
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:32,339
Speaker 1: Regardless, the thing that might fuck me is that I'm much more likely to die a catastrophic death than you are, I think.

519
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:33,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's almost guaranteed.

520
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,980
Speaker 1: I'm going skiing this weekend, most likely.

521
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,920
Speaker 0: You'll get dead this weekend.

522
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:38,720
Speaker 0: That's how it's going to happen.

523
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,540
Speaker 1: Now, the first ski trip of the year is always the cautious ski trip.

524
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,140
Speaker 1: Do I actually remember how to ski?

525
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,317
Speaker 1: Because at the end of the year, it's like I've been skiing all year, so it's like, yeah, let's go.

526
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:51,640
Speaker 1: The first time, it's like, yeah, the last time I skied, I stand there in the skis.

527
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,678
Speaker 1: I'm like, how do I turn?

528
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:54,719
Speaker 1: What do I do when I'm up there?

529
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,439
Speaker 0: You fall, you crash into a tree and die.

530
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,179
Speaker 1: I'm looking at the lift.

531
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,780
Speaker 1: I'm like, how do I get on this fucking thing?

532
00:24:59,265 --> 00:24:59,560
Speaker 0: You don't.

533
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,399
Speaker 0: You fall off like those people did.

534
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:05,238
Speaker 1: I saw a snowboarder jump off at Hunter Mountain last year.

535
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:05,805
Speaker 1: Whoa.

536
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:06,780
Speaker 1: Ski lift was stopped.

537
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was like, fuck it, and he just jumped off.

538
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:09,879
Speaker 0: Did he live?

539
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, he store boarded down.

540
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,399
Speaker 1: Well, he fell into a snowdrift, went, ah, dug himself out, and then he snowboarded down.

541
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:22,556
Speaker 1: Or for snowboard lingo, that means you go 10 feet, then you sit down on the slope and smoke pot.

542
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,558
Speaker 1: Fucking snowboarders.

543
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:28,840
Speaker 0: Why does the ski people let them smoke pot?

544
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,240
Speaker 0: Why don't the cops just come there and round them all up?

545
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,740
Speaker 1: Because you realize snowboarders to me are little more than speed bumps in my way.

546
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:38,098
Speaker 1: Anyway, not to get into that old thing.

547
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:42,280
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, it's your idea to do a show about oldness, and so far you can't even stay on.

548
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:51,539
Speaker 1: One of the reasons I picked up skiing as a sport is that when I'm skiing, I regularly see people who are in their 70s skiing better than I ski now.

549
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:54,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're either going as fast or they just go in steadily.

550
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,759
Speaker 1: Faster and better.

551
00:25:57,744 --> 00:25:59,020
Speaker 1: They actually have a lot of skill.

552
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,898
Speaker 1: I do not have that.

553
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,880
Speaker 0: Well, the speed of skiing comes from gravity more so than it comes from pushing, right?

554
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,259
Speaker 0: No, it comes from skill.

555
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:10,000
Speaker 0: Right, but the skill is not ... It's not like running where you are providing the propulsion.

556
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:19,639
Speaker 0: You are just providing the steadiness and the balance, right, which years and years of practice, if you're an old person, you've been skiing your whole life, then you got that down.

557
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:29,819
Speaker 0: But if it was propulsion, like if it was bobsledding, the old people might be able to keep it inside the little tube, but they wouldn't be able to go as fast because at the running start, they would not have.

558
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the same reason why I want to pick up racquetball again, because I see old ass dudes playing racquetball way better than I play now.

559
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,620
Speaker 1: Because I remember as a kid, I was young, I was fast, but I was not skilled.

560
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,000
Speaker 1: I could run all the way to the corner and get the ball.

561
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,999
Speaker 1: My dad was not nearly as fast as me, but he knew where the ball was going to go.

562
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:47,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

563
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,680
Speaker 0: That's pretty much ... You look at all old people's sports, right?

564
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:58,418
Speaker 0: It's like racquetball, shuffleboard, billiards isn't exclusively an old person sport, but old guys love to play it.

565
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:01,740
Speaker 1: I realize almost no one we know plays pool.

566
00:27:02,644 --> 00:27:04,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can't even hit the ball.

567
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,480
Speaker 0: Really?

568
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

569
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,200
Speaker 0: But those are all these sports where you don't need to have significant strength or speed.

570
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,318
Speaker 0: You have to have enough, but it's all about the precision and the accuracy and these sorts of things.

571
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,078
Speaker 0: Aiming and all these skills, but not aiming like in Counter-Strike, you're going to aim quickly.

572
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,400
Speaker 0: It's just aiming.

573
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,520
Speaker 0: So in shuffleboard, you can take all damn day and you push it with just the right amount.

574
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:29,110
Speaker 0: It's all about control and these sorts of things.

575
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:35,920
Speaker 0: that if you've lived a very long time and you practice a lot, then that is what you can be very good at.

576
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,180
Speaker 0: Whereas opposed to, say, something like hockey, an old person is not very good.

577
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:49,040
Speaker 1: But one thing I'm really fascinated with is the fact that there's a good chance we'll live to see the year 2040, 2050, 2060.

578
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,194
Speaker 0: Yep.

579
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,220
Speaker 1: Well, I can't even imagine what the world is going to be like then.

580
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,999
Speaker 0: No, it's not even bother.

581
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,779
Speaker 0: I just worry about today.

582
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,753
Speaker 1: I mean, think back 60 ... What was going on 60 years ago?

583
00:27:59,363 --> 00:27:59,918
Speaker 1: World War II.

584
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:01,899
Speaker 1: Oh, the end of World War II.

585
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,438
Speaker 0: World War II was over.

586
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,540
Speaker 1: 1950, end of World War II, all the cleanup.

587
00:28:06,882 --> 00:28:08,560
Speaker 0: It was recently over.

588
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:10,860
Speaker 1: But it was- That was a recent memory.

589
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:13,120
Speaker 0: All right.

590
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:13,680
Speaker 1: Yeah?

591
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
Speaker 1: You don't have anything to say about that, old man?

592
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:16,125
Speaker 0: No.

593
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,538
Speaker 0: When we're old, we're going to say, "Oh, man, what was happening 60 years

594
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:19,759
Speaker 0: ago?".

595
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,460
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

596
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,837
Speaker 0: Whoa, remember that?

597
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cleanup.

598
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,440
Speaker 1: The great Facebook wars of, I guess there's no more aughts.

599
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,278
Speaker 1: I've got to say, they were out of the aughts years.

600
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:31,031
Speaker 1: I like saying like 20 aughts five.

601
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,938
Speaker 0: You never said that.

602
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:33,512
Speaker 0: I did.

603
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,737
Speaker 0: You rarely said it.

604
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,720
Speaker 1: Well, I rarely ... Whenever I had occasion to say a year, I would use aughts.

605
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:41,443
Speaker 0: No, you would say 2009.

606
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:42,240
Speaker 1: Only on geek nights.

607
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:42,852
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

608
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:43,332
Speaker 1: Yeah?

609
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:47,280
Speaker 1: Because it didn't sound right to say, "I'm rim and this is geek night.

610
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,989
Speaker 1: January 4th, 20, aughts

611
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:50,893
Speaker 1: five.".

612
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:59,469
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, we should say, according to people who have studied this, during the aughts, you're supposed to say 2000 aughts, right?

613
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:06,500
Speaker 0: But now that we're in the not aughts, you're supposed to say 2011.

614
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,440
Speaker 0: Because remember we used to say, what year is it?

615
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:11,784
Speaker 0: We didn't say 1998.

616
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:13,420
Speaker 0: We said 1998.

617
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,681
Speaker 0: So now we should say 2011.

618
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:16,880
Speaker 1: See, I don't think it said we should.

619
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,958
Speaker 1: I think that's just what people do.

620
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:19,300
Speaker 0: I think that's what you're supposed to do.

621
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,878
Speaker 1: Based on what?

622
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,300
Speaker 0: Based on what linguists said on the internet.

623
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,540
Speaker 1: What even linguists said.

624
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,600
Speaker 0: There was someone talking about it on the internet in an academic article.

625
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,320
Speaker 1: Are you sure it was someone on the internet talking about it?

626
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,439
Speaker 0: It was an academic because the URL was the EDUs.

627
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,900
Speaker 1: Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

628
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:32,920
Speaker 0: I'm sure it was something.

629
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,620
Speaker 0: This show is so far not about oldness.

630
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,659
Speaker 1: We've talked a lot about oldness.

631
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,140
Speaker 1: What I do wonder about is that- All you've done is bicker.

632
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,960
Speaker 1: A big problem with the elderly today- Like an old person.

633
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:45,780
Speaker 1: Is that they get bored.

634
00:29:46,861 --> 00:29:56,419
Speaker 1: Every time I see retirement homes, or I'm in a retirement home, and I saw a lot of this when I was working for the hospital, like all these ancillary facilities and things, everyone looked really bored.

635
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:58,080
Speaker 0: Well, I see two extremes.

636
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:13,079
Speaker 0: Of course, it's probably, in reality, a wide gray area with all people all along the scale, but from what I see, I see old people who are either incredibly active or old people who are incredibly not active.

637
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,799
Speaker 0: For example, I got one grandma.

638
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,820
Speaker 0: She's doing something every damn day.

639
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,300
Speaker 0: You call her out, she is not there.

640
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:24,940
Speaker 0: She's doing something with her ladies, or she's going to the gym, or she's doing something every day, going to a book club.

641
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:32,960
Speaker 0: She is happening grandma, and then the other grandma sits in the house in Florida and doesn't do anything because I've watched TV, and only TV shows that involve police or detectives.

642
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,460
Speaker 0: That's all she's doing, and she's very bored all the time.

643
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:46,980
Speaker 1: Well, I've read, prior to this, what got me thinking about the show was that I read a whole bunch of articles recently talking about the problem of elderly loneliness, that pretty much from now- All your friends die.

644
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,400
Speaker 0: You don't make new friends, and then your spouse dies, and then you're alone.

645
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:51,499
Speaker 1: It's a huge problem.

646
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,620
Speaker 0: Your family, even if you had children and grandchildren, they live far away.

647
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:56,900
Speaker 0: Even if they don't, they're busy.

648
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,915
Speaker 0: They're not there all day, so it's eight hours a day.

649
00:30:58,935 --> 00:30:59,600
Speaker 0: you're sitting there.

650
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:08,100
Speaker 0: You don't have to go to work, so you don't have coworkers to keep you company, so you're just sitting there alone for at least eight hours a day, and maybe a nurse to keep you company or something.

651
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:09,240
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a lot of outreach.

652
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:13,680
Speaker 1: Look at all these programs of get young people to spend time with an old person.

653
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:19,640
Speaker 1: I feel like that will not be a problem by the time we are old because we have the internet.

654
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,360
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

655
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:27,660
Speaker 0: Us, we will definitely ... Our generation definitely seems to be able to occupy itself with MMOs, if nothing else.

656
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:37,940
Speaker 1: Dude, if nothing else, if no more entertainment media were ever made from now until the day I die, and I live to be 100, I will never run out of books to read, movies to watch.

657
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,131
Speaker 0: No, but you'll still be lonely.

658
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,059
Speaker 0: You don't need people.

659
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,160
Speaker 0: If you have the internet, though, then you kind of sort of have people.

660
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,579
Speaker 1: Yes, but the internet will give me people for sure.

661
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:47,593
Speaker 1: There's no way it won't.

662
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,255
Speaker 1: Yep.

663
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:57,060
Speaker 1: What I really ... I don't worry about it, but we complain a lot about old people on geek nights, and in our normal lives for people who know us.

664
00:31:58,106 --> 00:31:59,900
Speaker 1: We complain about old people all the time.

665
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,380
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's sort of like, you look at different cultures in the world approach old people differently, especially in the Eastern nations.

666
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,869
Speaker 0: Old people are generally respected because they're old and wise, or at least stereotypically so.

667
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,540
Speaker 0: Whereas in the West, we've sort of, especially in the US, we're sort of looking down on our old people.

668
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,134
Speaker 0: They're a burden and a hassle, like, "Get out of here, old

669
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:22,476
Speaker 0: people.".

670
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,479
Speaker 1: I think both are true to a degree.

671
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:33,000
Speaker 0: Yes, both are true, but I think what's happening is it is verily true that old people have wisdom from being alive so long.

672
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,020
Speaker 0: They know things that young people do not know, right?

673
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,260
Speaker 0: Anyone who's been around long- Dude, we're old enough.

674
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:44,678
Speaker 1: Look at half our listeners in the forum who are like, "I have this really bullshit problem in college, blah, or high school, blah,

675
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:44,840
Speaker 1: blah.".

676
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,879
Speaker 1: We're like, "We're old.

677
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:46,559
Speaker 1: We've been through that.

678
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,034
Speaker 1: Here's what you

679
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:47,138
Speaker 1: do.".

680
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,920
Speaker 1: They're like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

681
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,780
Speaker 1: I'm not going to do that.

682
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,895
Speaker 1: You guys don't know what you're talking

683
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,179
Speaker 1: about.".

684
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:52,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

685
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:52,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're old.

686
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,259
Speaker 1: We know.

687
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, old people know.

688
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,980
Speaker 0: But at the same time, right, I would point out that recent Dilbert comic, right?

689
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,220
Speaker 1: Don't hit me with your modem.

690
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:01,800
Speaker 0: Don't hit me with your modem, right?

691
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:14,574
Speaker 0: Is that the world is changing so quickly that even an old person who has wisdom of age and experience, that wisdom may no longer be correct or useful?

692
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:18,780
Speaker 0: because just the world has changed so much that it's no longer true.

693
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:23,183
Speaker 0: It's like if I told you, "Hey, yeah, at the beginning of Mario 1, you want to jump on that

694
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:23,552
Speaker 0: Goomba.".

695
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,240
Speaker 0: But then a new version of Mario comes out where it's a Spiky instead of a Goomba, and then I'm an old person.

696
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,878
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh, you got to jump on the Goombas in Mario

697
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:32,260
Speaker 0: 1.".

698
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,140
Speaker 0: But the kids would be like, "All right, Grandpa, we got Mario 1 Super All-Stars Deluxe,".

699
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
Speaker 0: and I jumped on it, but it was a Spiky.

700
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:38,416
Speaker 1: "What?

701
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,051
Speaker 1: What the fuck happened to my

702
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:40,494
Speaker 1: world?".

703
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:42,960
Speaker 1: That's not real, Mario.

704
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:45,379
Speaker 0: I'll be a cranky old man.

705
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll be cranky and old.

706
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:47,399
Speaker 0: about video games, I think.

707
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,056
Speaker 0: Exactly.

708
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Speaker 1: Of course, I'm hoping that even as my body fails me, even if I can't get electronic immortality, I at least want VR.

709
00:33:56,561 --> 00:34:00,960
Speaker 1: I want to be able to sit in the catgirl machine for my remaining days.

710
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,139
Speaker 0: All right, go for it.

711
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:03,278
Speaker 0: It's all you.

712
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:04,379
Speaker 1: I got plans.

713
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:14,300
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, but it's like, you know, we complain about old people, but when we're complaining about old people, usually what we're complaining about- Well, it has very little to do with actual age in many cases.

714
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:29,900
Speaker 0: It has to do with an old attitude of people who have wisdom or experience or knowledge or they're, you know, most people are versed to change for, you know, an older time or a previous thing, and the world has passed that by, right?

715
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,460
Speaker 0: It's a different world now, and rather than update to the new world, they try to pull the world back to the way it used to be.

716
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,739
Speaker 1: You mean like, why are you kids playing these stupid console FPSs?

717
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,139
Speaker 1: We played real FPSs, like-.

718
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,659
Speaker 0: Why do you listen to that jazz music?

719
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,159
Speaker 0: Why do you listen to that rock and roll music?

720
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,540
Speaker 0: Why do you listen to that rap music?

721
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,040
Speaker 0: Why do you listen to that, you know, techno music, right?

722
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:48,858
Speaker 0: It's like, hello.

723
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,560
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the controversial music is right now.

724
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,259
Speaker 0: There isn't any.

725
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

726
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,120
Speaker 0: Thank God.

727
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:24,960
Speaker 0: But anyway, the thing, you know, the point is, it's like, look, some people keep up with the times, and some people, regardless of their age, there are 30-year-old people who I consider to be old people because they have this attitude of, you know, the world, some older world is better, and we should bring back progress to a preview, you know, or, you know, they insist on holding these ideas that might have been good in a previous world, but the world has changed, and they still stick to their old ideas rather than updating to the new world, and that's what I'm talking about when I complain about most old people.

728
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:38,199
Speaker 1: Well, this is why I think we'll be okay because I feel like a lot of people, when they get older, it's like they forget what it was like to be a kid, or they forget like- A kid isn't what it's like to be a kid now.

729
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:38,839
Speaker 0: It's different.

730
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,779
Speaker 1: But then some things are fundamentally the same, and they just forget, like, how many old people basically don't want kids to go out and have fun?

731
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:45,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

732
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,680
Speaker 0: I mean, how many old people who say that were out- It's not that they don't want the kids to have fun, right?

733
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,039
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, kids are having fun.

734
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:00,420
Speaker 0: That's nice," until the kids make noise, which bothers them, but, you know, it's like they care about themselves before they care about the children, right?

735
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:16,459
Speaker 0: When they were children, they would make noise, and those old people in those days would be bothered by the noise, but they didn't see that part because they were children at the time, and now the only part that they notice is the part where, "This noise is bothering me," and they don't recognize, "Look, these children need to play for their

736
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:16,600
Speaker 0: health.".

737
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:30,860
Speaker 1: But see, I think we straddle a kind of progressive middle ground in that I still prefer and can articulate why I think, like, for example, older PCFPSs and things like that are better, but at the same time, or like my experiences with old school gaming.

738
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:42,550
Speaker 1: But you're not like- But I always qualify things by saying, "Yes, the experience I had playing DOS games and having to figure it all out made me a better person, but no way in hell should the world go back to that

739
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:43,037
Speaker 1: BS.".

740
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:43,640
Speaker 0: Hell no.

741
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,370
Speaker 0: I mean, like, if someone wanted to learn about, you know, like, that was what they wanted, I would tell them, "All right, then go and do it,".

742
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:52,013
Speaker 0: but I'm not saying, "Yeah, we should have DOS on every

743
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:52,419
Speaker 0: computer.".

744
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:53,120
Speaker 0: It's like, "What?

745
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:54,568
Speaker 0: You're talking about?

746
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,058
Speaker 0: everyone should drive stick

747
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:56,239
Speaker 0: shift.".

748
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:56,970
Speaker 0: It's like, "Fuck

749
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,152
Speaker 0: no.".

750
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:05,660
Speaker 1: I mean, of course, I wonder if we'll even be able to retire because it seems like retirement for as new an idea as it is, is already kind of obsolete.

751
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:17,736
Speaker 1: Like very few people, I think, have the means to save for a real retirement, especially if, you know, you want to retire at 65 or 70 and you live 20 more years, how are you going to save money to live 20 years?

752
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,540
Speaker 0: I mean, basically what happened, right, is we had a country where people weren't really that well off.

753
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,140
Speaker 0: Everyone worked crazy hard.

754
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:25,020
Speaker 0: There was a depression.

755
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,718
Speaker 0: They worked crazy hard, right?

756
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:44,617
Speaker 0: And because they worked crazy hard and kept working crazy hard for a couple of decades, they made so much monies and they were so good, you know, relatively speaking, it was never perfect, right, that they were able to afford things like pensions and these sorts of things.

757
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,380
Speaker 1: Well, part of that was an old world structure of working at a company forever.

758
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:57,439
Speaker 0: But then they tried to hold on to these things even as they could no longer afford them over over great periods of time.

759
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:14,837
Speaker 0: And eventually, you know, because they tried to maintain or increase the standard of living, you know, when the economy would not really keep up and support it and, you know, people started buying things they couldn't afford and living in a big house when they had apartment money and having a pension when they had barely 401K money.

760
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,380
Speaker 1: You know, now having a pension is a great thing as long as it continues to exist.

761
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, pension problem is more just that the world of work has changed.

762
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:25,483
Speaker 0: Yep.

763
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:27,620
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, it's basically right.

764
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,680
Speaker 0: They spent all this money and now there isn't enough.

765
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,062
Speaker 0: And the other thing is, on top of that, people lived longer and they were retiring at the same age.

766
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:45,560
Speaker 0: So not only did we need to save more money and make more money, which we weren't doing, but it would cost even more money to pay for people to retire.

767
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:50,680
Speaker 0: So the cost of the retirement was going up and mathematically is just not working out.

768
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,616
Speaker 1: So, I mean, personally, I'm saving like I have a 401K.

769
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:56,040
Speaker 0: Mine is actually doing real well.

770
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,045
Speaker 1: I got three together and I'm putting money into it, a decent amount of money, but I'm not banking on it.

771
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,280
Speaker 0: No, no, I'm not expecting to live off of that.

772
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,339
Speaker 0: You know, basically the reason I do it is because it's easy.

773
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,839
Speaker 0: I can, you know, you should.

774
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:09,403
Speaker 1: Yeah.

775
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,700
Speaker 0: And if you look at the numbers, it's totally working out.

776
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,320
Speaker 0: But you can do cool stuff with it.

777
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,060
Speaker 0: Like you can take a loan, you can loan that money to yourself, pay it back with interest, but you're paying the interest to yourself.

778
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:20,103
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:22,160
Speaker 0: You can do cool stuff like that, which is very useful.

780
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:30,800
Speaker 0: And especially since I started it so early, you know, it has a pretty good chance of success unless it's hooked on a can, in which case doesn't matter.

781
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:35,800
Speaker 1: I'm pretty much, though, assuming that there will be no Social Security when I'm 70.

782
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,424
Speaker 0: Oh, hell no.

783
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:38,840
Speaker 1: There's no way that will continue to exist.

784
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:42,840
Speaker 1: My money is going into it, but I'm pretty much considering that.

785
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,560
Speaker 0: By law, it's going into it.

786
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:46,919
Speaker 0: I have no choice.

787
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,015
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, that's, you know, the whole thing is a rough situation because it's like, OK, someone's an old person now.

788
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:54,402
Speaker 0: Right.

789
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,960
Speaker 0: They are incapable of working.

790
00:39:58,101 --> 00:40:01,980
Speaker 0: Or, you know, even if they could work, it's like they couldn't work well.

791
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,578
Speaker 0: You know, what job are they going to do?

792
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:04,404
Speaker 0: Right.

793
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,240
Speaker 0: They're not going to make really enough money.

794
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:08,560
Speaker 0: So they can't work, but we're not going to kill them.

795
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:09,142
Speaker 0: Right.

796
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:14,104
Speaker 0: And their kids aren't so rich that their kids can just pay to take care of them forever.

797
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,520
Speaker 0: Or maybe they don't even have any children.

798
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,022
Speaker 0: Who knows?

799
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,920
Speaker 0: So what does this person do?

800
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,040
Speaker 0: Well, you know, they can, you know, live within their meager means.

801
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:27,320
Speaker 0: If their Social Security goes away, they might not have, you know, any continued income.

802
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,860
Speaker 0: They just have the money they have and that's it for the rest of their life.

803
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,119
Speaker 0: And what if they live really long?

804
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:34,400
Speaker 0: What if they need an expensive medical procedure?

805
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:35,717
Speaker 0: What do they do?

806
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,461
Speaker 1: I think we'll have socialized medicine by the time I'm 70.

807
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:39,924
Speaker 1: I don't know.

808
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,040
Speaker 1: If we don't, this country is fucked.

809
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:46,325
Speaker 0: But even if you have socialized medicine, it's like that's only going to pay for some things.

810
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:47,420
Speaker 0: You can't pay for everything.

811
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:51,080
Speaker 0: So, you know, if you got something normal like the flu, it's like, you're all right.

812
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,210
Speaker 0: You got pneumonia.

813
00:40:52,312 --> 00:40:52,780
Speaker 0: You're all right.

814
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,550
Speaker 0: You broke a leg.

815
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:54,120
Speaker 0: You're all right.

816
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:55,859
Speaker 0: Oh, you need like a whole hip replacement.

817
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,660
Speaker 0: Well, maybe you got weird cancer in a weird place.

818
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,536
Speaker 0: Well, now what?

819
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:01,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

820
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,183
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I wouldn't have been able to save enough money to deal with that anyway.

821
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,778
Speaker 1: So I basically can't do anything about it.

822
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

823
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,220
Speaker 1: Of course, we do have the advantage that we're both very well off.

824
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:23,683
Speaker 1: And I feel like I worry that in the next 30, 40 years, retirement is going to move further and further into something that is only within reach of the upper middle class and the wealthy.

825
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:27,846
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's pretty much, you know, anyone who's employed, I think, is going to be able to retire.

826
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:41,066
Speaker 1: A lot of people who are employed, Scott, make, you know, forty thousand dollars or whatever a year and can live off of that, but can't afford to contribute enough to a 401(k) to actually retire 20 years of their life on it.

827
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:41,430
Speaker 0: Yes.

828
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,379
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

829
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:42,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

830
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:43,223
Speaker 1: What do you do?

831
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:50,283
Speaker 1: And how easy will it be to get a job when I'm 70?

832
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:50,960
Speaker 0: Oh, impossible.

833
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,719
Speaker 1: That's why I'm not worrying about it at all.

834
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:56,236
Speaker 0: I mean, basically, there's nothing you can really do about it.

836
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:58,379
Speaker 0: besides, you know, save some monies for yourself.

837
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:58,781
Speaker 1: Yep.

838
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:00,270
Speaker 1: And I'll save enough money to where.

839
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:03,199
Speaker 1: if like I think I'm going to live another 10 years, I'm running out of money.

840
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:07,384
Speaker 1: I don't know, blaze of glory, wander off somewhere, go to Costa Rica, do something crazy.

841
00:42:07,404 --> 00:42:09,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, that's the other thing.

842
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,022
Speaker 0: It's like when we retire, it's like, well, now it's like the vacation we've been waiting for.

843
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:19,649
Speaker 0: The thing is, I don't know, we should retire the beginning of the life, not the end of the life.

844
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:20,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

845
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,564
Speaker 1: So you'd imagine this.

846
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,110
Speaker 1: So you have to you get to live.

847
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:26,909
Speaker 1: basically Logan's run Logan's run until you're 40.

848
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:28,280
Speaker 1: And then you got to work the rest of your life.

849
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,260
Speaker 0: I would just kill myself.

850
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,422
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people would just kill themselves or not work and just be like, screw you.

851
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:34,991
Speaker 0: I'm not doing it.

852
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:35,580
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?

853
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:37,979
Speaker 0: Make me put you in jail.

854
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:44,880
Speaker 1: That's why I'm not focused so much on my old age.

855
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,530
Speaker 1: I'm basically enjoying now and planning minimally and nominally for the next 60 years of my life.

856
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:53,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

857
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:08,439
Speaker 0: I wonder what, you know, it's like, you know, I've talked to really old people, but like, what are the people who are like 60 something like now who are almost retiring, like, you know, or maybe like the people who are going to like the late 50s people, it's like they're going to retire soon.

858
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,879
Speaker 0: Maybe it's like, what are they?

859
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,960
Speaker 1: I mean, the retirement age is already pretty much going up to 70.

860
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,239
Speaker 0: And they they got things to pay off, like, you know, they're paying off things like their kids, student loans or also there's the fact that the life expectancy in the US drops.

861
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:26,040
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, in the past cycle do almost entirely to obese people.

862
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:26,545
Speaker 0: Yeah.

863
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:27,052
Speaker 0: Yeah.

864
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,984
Speaker 0: I don't know.

865
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:38,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's getting to be, you know, that maybe that is maybe all the fat people from our generation will die young and then there will be enough money for the rest of us to retire on.

866
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,620
Speaker 0: I just think the status quo of retirement is changing.

867
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,220
Speaker 0: I think the change upsets old people and young people deal with it.

868
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,531
Speaker 1: I don't even think it's that I think.

869
00:43:47,854 --> 00:43:48,600
Speaker 1: take it one step further.

870
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:58,410
Speaker 1: I think by the time we're at retirement age, the world social order will be unrecognizable compared to what it is today, at least in terms of the economics of retirement.

871
00:43:59,058 --> 00:43:59,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

872
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,520
Speaker 0: I mean, if we live to be 100, it definitely will be.

873
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,108
Speaker 0: Think about what it was 100 years ago.

874
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,765
Speaker 0: in 1910, the world social order was completely different.

875
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:07,980
Speaker 1: Well, World War One.

876
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:12,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, the world social order was completely different in 1910 than it was in 2010.

877
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:20,520
Speaker 0: So if we live, you know, to let's see, we're born in 82, so in 20 in 2082, it's going to be completely different.

878
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:23,380
Speaker 0: It's not even going to be even close to what it is now, especially.

879
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,199
Speaker 1: I mean, the rate of change, I think, is faster now than it was then.

880
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's going to be ridiculous.

881
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,700
Speaker 1: I mean, look at how much the Internet changed.

882
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,399
Speaker 1: I don't know, in the last two years.

883
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:32,023
Speaker 0: Yep.

884
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:34,820
Speaker 1: Ten years ago, there was barely Internet.

885
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,960
Speaker 1: Twenty years ago, there basically wasn't an Internet.

886
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:37,662
Speaker 0: Yep.

887
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:41,600
Speaker 1: I do, at least I look forward nominally.

888
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:42,700
Speaker 1: I don't look forward to getting old.

889
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,920
Speaker 1: I still think aging is a disease that we should treat.

890
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:48,780
Speaker 0: I don't, you know, I'm slower now than I used to be.

891
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:57,440
Speaker 0: But then you have to worry about like, well, there's not enough resources on earth to support, you know, the number of people continuing to make new people if nobody dies.

892
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,380
Speaker 1: So here's let's go crazy.

893
00:45:00,382 --> 00:45:07,499
Speaker 1: I would be OK, say we solved aging to where you age to twenty two and there is no degradation from that point ever.

894
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,103
Speaker 1: This is perfect.

895
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,919
Speaker 1: You will get one hundred and twenty years and then they kill you.

896
00:45:13,908 --> 00:45:14,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think that's OK.

897
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,584
Speaker 1: Why not?

898
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:16,920
Speaker 0: What do you mean, why not?

899
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,562
Speaker 1: Because you can't.

900
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:24,478
Speaker 1: or I mean, the other option is the ultra rich will live forever and they'll prevent anyone else from getting the resources to do so.

901
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,920
Speaker 0: Repo, genetic opera.

902
00:45:27,845 --> 00:45:28,699
Speaker 1: But how about this?

903
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,675
Speaker 1: So you get one hundred and twenty years no matter what.

904
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:38,052
Speaker 1: As you know, and then at the end of one hundred and twenty years there and have some sort of thing like you only have one kid or some.

905
00:45:38,274 --> 00:45:39,501
Speaker 1: let's forget the specifics of that part.

906
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:48,659
Speaker 1: China, when you're one hundred and twenty, you can appeal your death and it's just a worldwide referendum or some sort of system retarded.

907
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,562
Speaker 0: Why not?

908
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:50,509
Speaker 0: It's not going.

909
00:45:50,569 --> 00:45:51,818
Speaker 1: technology could make that happen.

910
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,783
Speaker 0: Yeah.

911
00:45:53,246 --> 00:45:55,680
Speaker 0: Where you have to say the system is really going to work.

912
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,329
Speaker 1: You have to make the case to a court to say, look, I think I deserve another hundred and twenty years.

913
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,919
Speaker 1: and here's why.

914
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, the system is not going to work.

915
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:02,704
Speaker 1: All right.

916
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:03,439
Speaker 1: Give me a system.

917
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:06,840
Speaker 0: We don't let anyone be immortal.

918
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,871
Speaker 1: So we have to deal with all the bullshit of aging.

919
00:46:09,912 --> 00:46:10,896
Speaker 1: that is just.

920
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,243
Speaker 1: there's no reason to suffer through it.

921
00:46:13,088 --> 00:46:15,601
Speaker 1: We should suffer through the effects of age, even if we can prevent them.

922
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:17,769
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's either.

923
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,980
Speaker 0: if it's you know, you're basically saying it's either one person or every person.

924
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:22,383
Speaker 0: Right.

925
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:24,780
Speaker 0: It's like, well, we can all suffer a little.

926
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:27,900
Speaker 0: Or everyone is aging sucks ass.

927
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:31,380
Speaker 1: I would rather live the same amount of time that I'm going to live now.

928
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:31,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

929
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:32,480
Speaker 0: Aging sucks ass.

930
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,619
Speaker 0: How does aging compare to hope?

931
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,437
Speaker 0: Don't know, Ken.

932
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,509
Speaker 1: But Scott, what if I'm going to live 80 years anyway, but I'm in perfect health for those entire 80 years?

933
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:43,543
Speaker 1: Hey.

934
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:47,120
Speaker 1: I would rather accept a time limit and live those years.

935
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,880
Speaker 0: Also, when they come to kill you and you're 80, you just can be like, all right, maybe or I'll try to run and you know what?

936
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:53,738
Speaker 1: I won't get away.

937
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,040
Speaker 1: No one gets away from the runners.

938
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

939
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:57,362
Speaker 0: OK.

940
00:46:59,447 --> 00:47:00,650
Speaker 0: Your your plans will look crazy.

941
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:01,536
Speaker 1: It's not that crazy.

942
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:03,470
Speaker 1: We've got to be transhumanist.

943
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,193
Speaker 0: You're crazy.

944
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:05,259
Speaker 1: I don't.

945
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:07,350
Speaker 1: I hope it's not to keep it realistic.

946
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:12,770
Speaker 1: We might be on the edge of not getting immortality, but we might see immortality.

947
00:47:13,513 --> 00:47:13,696
Speaker 0: Yes.

948
00:47:13,736 --> 00:47:14,468
Speaker 0: Someone younger than us.

949
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:15,700
Speaker 1: Yeah.

950
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:16,650
Speaker 1: What if we're 90?

951
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,630
Speaker 1: They're like, we've perfected.

952
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:26,309
Speaker 0: At least no one had to be around to see them, you know, fill the world with too many people who can't eat anything because no food left because maybe they won't need to eat because they've done the Michio Kaku thing.

953
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:28,950
Speaker 0: I'm glad to say I won't see a world with no delicious food.

954
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,270
Speaker 1: Maybe they have infinite delicious food due to Diamond Age.

955
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,370
Speaker 0: Then I would be living in that world.

956
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:35,894
Speaker 0: Hooray.

957
00:47:36,036 --> 00:47:36,990
Speaker 1: And dying of old age.

958
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,030
Speaker 0: No, I'd replace myself with a diamond person.

959
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:49,270
Speaker 1: It'll be interesting to see how the crew maintains over the years, because when we're 80, I can imagine I'll still playing Counter-Strike.

960
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:49,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

961
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:51,950
Speaker 0: Odds are not everyone will make it that far.

962
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:52,475
Speaker 0: Yeah.

963
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:52,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

964
00:47:54,231 --> 00:47:58,710
Speaker 1: I think we got about 30 years is when we're going to see that, like the do or die time.

965
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,924
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I don't know about playing Counter-Strike because while Counter-Strike has been around for a decade.

966
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:03,350
Speaker 0: Right.

967
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,291
Speaker 0: It is.

968
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:07,249
Speaker 0: Think about how incredibly difficult it is for us to play tribes, too.

969
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,177
Speaker 0: Right.

970
00:48:09,297 --> 00:48:11,348
Speaker 0: You know, if Steam is going to be here in 80 years.

971
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,430
Speaker 1: We'll have to play tactical intervention instead.

972
00:48:13,711 --> 00:48:15,290
Speaker 0: I mean, how are we going to play Counter-Strike?

973
00:48:15,931 --> 00:48:18,310
Speaker 1: I imagine we'll be playing some sort of video game.

974
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,154
Speaker 0: Something.

975
00:48:19,174 --> 00:48:20,690
Speaker 1: I mean, it'll be fair.

976
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:21,337
Speaker 1: We're old men.

977
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:22,350
Speaker 0: We're already seeing.

978
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:23,240
Speaker 0: We're already seeing it.

979
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:24,090
Speaker 0: CES, right?

980
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,390
Speaker 0: They're talking about Windows 8 on ARM CPUs.

981
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,808
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike will never run on an ARM CPU.

982
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:29,692
Speaker 0: So ever.

983
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:33,210
Speaker 1: But at the very least, we'll be able to play games fairly or board games.

984
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,076
Speaker 1: Those don't go obsolete.

985
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:36,110
Speaker 1: As long as I can move, I can play Puerto Rico.

986
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:36,973
Speaker 0: That's true.

987
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:42,709
Speaker 1: And it's actually not that infeasible that we'll solve every German game we care about in our old age.

988
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:43,452
Speaker 0: Possible.

989
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,953
Speaker 0: Computers have become so advanced that they will solve them the way they solve checkers.

990
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:49,710
Speaker 1: So if computers do that, would you still play German board games?

991
00:48:50,993 --> 00:48:51,477
Speaker 0: It depends.

992
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,849
Speaker 0: I would have to make a better game.

993
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:57,490
Speaker 1: What if every game you design, a computer gives you the answer before you finish it?

994
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,909
Speaker 0: Depends if P equals NP or not.

995
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:00,690
Speaker 1: What if it doesn't matter?

996
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:01,910
Speaker 0: It does matter.

997
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,130
Speaker 1: What if it doesn't matter somehow?

998
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,929
Speaker 1: What if quantum mechanics like quantum computing just fixes that?

999
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,250
Speaker 1: We just solve everything.

1000
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,249
Speaker 0: But if quantum computing is there, then that then we know the answer.

1001
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:11,967
Speaker 0: That P is NP.

1002
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:17,110
Speaker 0: Otherwise, if it doesn't matter, if P is not NP, a quantum computer can help you.

1003
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,860
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1004
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,959
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1006
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,320
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1007
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,080
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1010
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:55,020
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
