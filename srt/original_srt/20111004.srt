1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,591
Speaker 0: It's a Tuesday, September 4th of 2011.

2
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:10,852
Speaker 0: I'm Arin.

3
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:13,940
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,706
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,138
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about the surprising rock of ages.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:20,946
Speaker 1: The weed.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,574
Speaker 0: It's a me, Mario.

8
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:26,857
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,544
Speaker 1: Mario!

10
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:33,688
Speaker 1: Where is the pasta?

11
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:38,530
Speaker 0: I don't know why I was thinking about this, but I remembered while I was on the subway today.

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,950
Speaker 0: I was just thinking about old conventions.

13
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:45,770
Speaker 0: I was thinking about OhioCon and how, you know, nowadays, we're the people who run conventions.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,069
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever other news.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,690
Speaker 0: If you ever want to disrupt people who have walkie-talkies, pretend to be Mario.

16
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:53,809
Speaker 1: I was going to work today.

17
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,330
Speaker 0: Okay, this is going to be so much more exciting than my anecdote.

18
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,408
Speaker 1: Actually, it might be.

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:58,987
Speaker 0: We'll see.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,817
Speaker 1: But I'm not going to make it exciting.

21
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:03,270
Speaker 1: I'm going to tell it in my usual bland, matter-of-fact fashion.

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,230
Speaker 0: Because I saw a whole bunch of people dressed up as zombies.

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,050
Speaker 1: With absolutely no sensationalism applied whatsoever.

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,290
Speaker 0: There was an entire crowd of people dressed up as zombies outside my office.

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, the stupid protesters.

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,670
Speaker 0: And as I was leaving work today, there was a stage on the street and all the stuff for a parade.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,102
Speaker 1: Great.

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,649
Speaker 0: So I don't know what's going on down there.

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,028
Speaker 1: So I got on the subway to go to work.

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,619
Speaker 1: And it's getting to 57th and 7th.

31
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,584
Speaker 1: And I get off at the next stop, which is 49th.

32
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,420
Speaker 1: And the intercom comes on, and they're like, "Police activity, 49th.

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,126
Speaker 1: We will be bypassing

34
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:31,186
Speaker 1: 49th.".

35
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,058
Speaker 1: So I make the quick calculation.

36
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,067
Speaker 1: Do I get off now, or do I go through to 42nd?

37
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:37,814
Speaker 1: I got off now.

38
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:42,390
Speaker 1: That was a good move, because even though it's one block further away from the office, it's still close enough.

39
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,430
Speaker 1: Well, it's funny.

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,190
Speaker 1: And you're getting off the subway, which means you're starting walking sooner.

41
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,610
Speaker 0: Because yesterday, the NQ was delayed due to two unrelated incidents.

42
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,530
Speaker 0: Someone got sick and had to be taken off the train to a hospital.

43
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:58,350
Speaker 0: And someone got hit by the train at a different station at the same time.

44
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,095
Speaker 1: I figured, they usually say police activity.

45
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:04,690
Speaker 1: That means, you know, that there is someone following the tracks.

46
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,030
Speaker 1: Or something along those lines.

47
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:10,164
Speaker 0: The thing is, they usually say, like, there's a Twitter you should subscribe to.

48
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,630
Speaker 0: that says exactly what happened.

49
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,049
Speaker 0: Every time.

50
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,850
Speaker 1: I should find that Twitter.

51
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll give it to you.

52
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,890
Speaker 0: I forget what it is offhand.

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,505
Speaker 0: So it's always like, "Someone got

54
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:17,768
Speaker 0: hit!".

55
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,814
Speaker 1: Get off the train.

56
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:19,618
Speaker 1: Start going south.

57
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,347
Speaker 1: Eventually, there's a police line.

58
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:21,970
Speaker 1: Do not cross.

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,681
Speaker 1: And the street is, like, empty.

60
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:24,810
Speaker 1: And there's a cop there.

61
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,770
Speaker 1: So, of course, a bunch of New Yorkers duck under the rope and start going to work.

62
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,099
Speaker 1: Yup.

63
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:29,615
Speaker 1: And I went with them.

64
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,304
Speaker 1: And then the cop was like, "No, really?

65
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:31,968
Speaker 1: No, you gotta go

66
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:32,229
Speaker 1: back.".

67
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:33,401
Speaker 1: So we all went back.

68
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:34,290
Speaker 1: And I go to the cop.

69
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,063
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Hey, my work is, like, right there.

70
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:37,988
Speaker 1: Can I just go to

71
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:38,209
Speaker 1: work?".

72
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,238
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Nope.

73
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,046
Speaker 1: Can't go through

74
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:40,227
Speaker 1: here.".

75
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,918
Speaker 1: I'm like, "I can't just go to

76
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:42,139
Speaker 1: work?".

77
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,306
Speaker 1: He's like, "Calm and tell him you're gonna be

78
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:43,507
Speaker 1: late.".

79
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,730
Speaker 1: And then some other guy comes up with a bike and he's fighting with the cop.

80
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,220
Speaker 1: Like, "I pay your fucking salary.

81
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:48,845
Speaker 1: Don't yell at me.

82
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:49,288
Speaker 1: Blah, blah,

83
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:49,550
Speaker 1: blah.".

84
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:50,450
Speaker 0: Ah, bikers.

85
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm like,

86
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:51,587
Speaker 1: "Whatever.".

87
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,290
Speaker 0: Actually, I almost got hit by a car yesterday and I kicked the side of the car and damaged it to prevent them from hitting me.

88
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:58,010
Speaker 0: But I digress.

89
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,084
Speaker 1: Alright, so, I go around as a resourceful New Yorker.

90
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,130
Speaker 1: I take the other path.

91
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:02,956
Speaker 1: So I go around.

92
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,084
Speaker 1: And I go around.

93
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:04,729
Speaker 1: And it goes through the park.

94
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,415
Speaker 1: Not the real park.

95
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,570
Speaker 1: The Barclays building opens to the public area.

96
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's funny how New York, when they want to block a street or they want to keep people from going somewhere, very rarely do they block all the real ways.

97
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,990
Speaker 0: So it's like the people who are native to a neighborhood can get around pretty much any police block.

98
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,733
Speaker 0: Everything's blocked.

99
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,296
Speaker 1: Everything's blocked.

100
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:24,718
Speaker 1: I go.

101
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,064
Speaker 1: I'm getting close to my building.

102
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,190
Speaker 1: And another blockage.

103
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,155
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

104
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,050
Speaker 0: Very rarely do they block everything.

105
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:38,230
Speaker 1: But the blockage rope, the plastic rope thingy that blocked, is tied to the door of the service entrance to my building.

106
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:38,733
Speaker 1: So I went in.

107
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,130
Speaker 1: And I get upstairs and there is nobody there.

108
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,821
Speaker 1: So I'm looking out the window at the blockage out on the street.

109
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,470
Speaker 1: And it's pretty empty.

110
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,142
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "What the fuck's going on out

111
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:48,283
Speaker 1: there?".

112
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,089
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of cops.

113
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,023
Speaker 1: They blocked off these two intersections.

114
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:51,708
Speaker 1: Nothing's going on.

115
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,134
Speaker 1: I go on the internet.

116
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,021
Speaker 1: I'm looking to see what's going, what the problem is.

117
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:55,805
Speaker 1: I look outside.

118
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,050
Speaker 1: I see some, you know, cops.

119
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,194
Speaker 1: They got some trucks.

120
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,177
Speaker 1: They got some cars.

121
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,602
Speaker 1: There's a city bus.

122
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,890
Speaker 1: There's just cops everywhere.

123
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,818
Speaker 1: And a fireman was there.

124
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,246
Speaker 1: And the ambulance.

125
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:06,749
Speaker 1: And whatever.

126
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,478
Speaker 1: And there's nothing going on.

127
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:09,183
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Huh.

128
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,069
Speaker 1: What the fuck is this

129
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:10,230
Speaker 1: shit?".

130
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:12,539
Speaker 1: So I go on the internets and Twitter.

131
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,887
Speaker 1: Of course, news Google has nothing.

132
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:14,430
Speaker 1: I go to Twitter.

133
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:14,941
Speaker 0: Yup.

134
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,262
Speaker 1: And Twitter was basically like, "Suspicious

135
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:18,724
Speaker 1: package."

136
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,144
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "You

137
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,149
Speaker 1: motherfuckers.".

138
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,868
Speaker 1: God dammit.

139
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:21,253
Speaker 1: "You

140
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:21,800
Speaker 1: fuckers.".

141
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:22,469
Speaker 1: So I'm watching.

142
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,640
Speaker 0: When has the suspicious package ever been?

143
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,590
Speaker 0: anything but someone's underwear or a dildo or something?

144
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,694
Speaker 1: So I look out and I see.

145
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,119
Speaker 1: I'm looking around more closely.

146
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,270
Speaker 1: And there's one bomb squad guy getting armored up with a big green armor.

147
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,356
Speaker 1: And he is sweating his balls off.

148
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,280
Speaker 1: And he's fooling around.

149
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,585
Speaker 1: They're playing with the armor.

150
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,990
Speaker 1: The cops are goofing off, right?

151
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,476
Speaker 1: Then eventually the guy goes over to the bus.

152
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:43,900
Speaker 1: Goes on the bus.

153
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,407
Speaker 1: Spends some time on the bus.

154
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,430
Speaker 1: Comes off the bus.

155
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:49,335
Speaker 1: Gives the guy the thumbs up.

156
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:54,210
Speaker 1: Waddles back over to where he started as fast as he can so they can take all that armor off.

157
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,256
Speaker 0: How much do they pay?

158
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:56,583
Speaker 0: armor-wearing guy?

159
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:57,729
Speaker 0: Because guys, I'll tell you what.

160
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,505
Speaker 1: Armor-wearing guy was sweating his balls off.

161
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:01,149
Speaker 1: Let me tell you.

162
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,053
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty confident.

163
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:06,890
Speaker 0: I would not be uncomfortable going up to pretty much any suspicious package in no armor.

164
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,710
Speaker 0: Because the odds of it being a bomb.

165
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,014
Speaker 1: I also would have, right?

166
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:14,270
Speaker 1: So then all the other cops help him take the armor off and they give him a giant water to drink.

167
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,700
Speaker 1: Then investigator guy goes up where nothing.

168
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,930
Speaker 1: Then he starts measuring and evidencing and shit.

169
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,850
Speaker 1: And then he goes, eventually another guy goes on the bus and he comes out with just some backpack and he empties it and there's a bunch of papers and shit in it.

170
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,050
Speaker 1: It's a backpack.

171
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,350
Speaker 0: God damn it, New York.

172
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,128
Speaker 0: Someone left it on the bus.

173
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:30,449
Speaker 1: So here's my new policy.

174
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,919
Speaker 1: Yeah?

175
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,610
Speaker 1: If anyone, you know, the policy they want you to do is if you see something, say something, right?

176
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,970
Speaker 0: But that just inconveniences everyone.

177
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,069
Speaker 1: If I see something, I'm opening it.

178
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:41,971
Speaker 1: And you know what?

179
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:48,069
Speaker 1: If someone else sees something and points it out and is going to say something, I'm just going over and opening it as fast as I can.

180
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,785
Speaker 0: Of course then, you know, the hipster who's five feet away messing with something is going to run over like, "Thief!

181
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:53,407
Speaker 1: Masher!".

182
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,605
Speaker 1: And I'll just be like, "Here, take your fucking bag.

183
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:55,968
Speaker 1: I don't want

184
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:56,029
Speaker 1: it.".

185
00:05:57,251 --> 00:06:04,050
Speaker 1: The only thing I might be worried about is if some other incredibly paranoid person tries to physically restrain me thinking I'm going to kill them by opening the bag.

186
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,250
Speaker 0: That would be hilarious though.

187
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:06,150
Speaker 1: Right.

188
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,229
Speaker 0: It would almost be worth it.

189
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,829
Speaker 1: I would just hope, I would just, because it's like, you know, the person wouldn't kill me, right?

190
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,026
Speaker 1: It's like, as long as I just get the bag and open it and be like, "See there.

191
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:14,308
Speaker 1: Good.

192
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:14,650
Speaker 1: Done.".

193
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:16,410
Speaker 0: Maybe we need to make a movement on that front.

194
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,549
Speaker 0: See something, open it.

195
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,249
Speaker 1: That's right.

196
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,610
Speaker 0: Let's make this a movement.

197
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,530
Speaker 0: I'll try to make a poster.

198
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,310
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing.

199
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,410
Speaker 1: Anytime, I don't care, you know what?

200
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,009
Speaker 1: And if it's a bomb, if I'm wrong and I die, it's okay.

201
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,249
Speaker 0: Scott, you took one for the team.

202
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:27,828
Speaker 1: It's okay.

203
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,249
Speaker 0: You took one for the team.

204
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:30,449
Speaker 1: It's okay.

205
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,029
Speaker 1: I'll, I'll, it's worth it.

206
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,167
Speaker 0: Alright, that beats my anecdote about almost being hit by a car and kicking in someone's side panel to avoid it.

207
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,009
Speaker 0: Basically, they're going to like swerve over me.

208
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,010
Speaker 0: And they didn't have their turn signal on or anything.

209
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,730
Speaker 0: They start swerving.

210
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,889
Speaker 0: They bump my bike, like the handlebar.

211
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,230
Speaker 0: But it's like, it's so fast, right?

212
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,250
Speaker 0: And I'm like, how can I get this person's attention?

213
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,590
Speaker 0: Because there's, on my bike, there was no way to get out of their way.

214
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,529
Speaker 0: I would have been smashed into like the curb and like, I would have probably been fucked up.

215
00:06:56,232 --> 00:07:06,570
Speaker 0: So I smacked her window and kicked the car because the kick one, the smacking would get her attention and the kicking, I was able to jump myself onto the curb.

216
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:16,890
Speaker 0: So I do this and simultaneously, she turns to me with the noise and screams and swerves off and like stops in the middle of the road and her side panel was slightly dented.

217
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:17,730
Speaker 0: And then I just kept biking.

218
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,286
Speaker 0: Cause fuck you.

219
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:18,970
Speaker 0: That's right.

220
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:19,623
Speaker 0: Yep.

221
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,429
Speaker 1: I haven't actually had to do that.

222
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,650
Speaker 0: That was the first time I've ever been almost struck or struck by anything that wasn't another biker.

223
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,110
Speaker 1: I actually haven't had those problems.

224
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:35,390
Speaker 1: And even though I've been biking to work for like two years, the only times I've had twice, I've accidentally bumped into people's side mirrors.

225
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,229
Speaker 0: Ah, I've never done that.

226
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,639
Speaker 1: Yeah.

227
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:40,010
Speaker 1: But actually I just, you know, I was just like, oops, sorry dude.

228
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,350
Speaker 1: I almost hit.

229
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,770
Speaker 1: It's not like I broke their side mirror.

230
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,010
Speaker 1: I just like sort of popped it backwards.

231
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,630
Speaker 0: A Chinatown like restaurant delivery guy who in the middle of the night when I was biking home right at no reflectors, no headlights, no nothing.

232
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,630
Speaker 0: I was riding the wrong way up a dark one lane bike lane.

233
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,568
Speaker 1: I hate those guys.

234
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:57,290
Speaker 1: They're all over the place.

235
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,229
Speaker 0: He didn't even swerve.

236
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,289
Speaker 0: He didn't even react.

237
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,270
Speaker 0: And the thing is I had a light like blurring in his face.

238
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,889
Speaker 0: So bright.

239
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:03,489
Speaker 0: I don't know.

240
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,450
Speaker 0: I don't think they, they're like shades just moving from restaurant to restaurant.

241
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,210
Speaker 0: But anyway, Rach came out.

242
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,868
Speaker 1: Gaming news.

243
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,706
Speaker 0: Rach came out.

244
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,602
Speaker 1: Have you played it?

245
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,288
Speaker 1: So here's the funny thing.

246
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,410
Speaker 1: I played it for my iPhone.

247
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,469
Speaker 0: When Rach was announced.

248
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,369
Speaker 1: Rach for the iPhone is basically just like the old Area 51 arcade game.

249
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:21,569
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

250
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:22,409
Speaker 1: That's it.

251
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,710
Speaker 0: That was an okay game.

252
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,970
Speaker 0: But anyway, I remember Rach when it was announced when, you know, when people said it was, you know, Rach is coming.

253
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:32,650
Speaker 1: I remember thinking, oh shit, it might make a good game.

254
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,130
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, the thing that I was expecting, they never made a bad game except Doom 3.

255
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,049
Speaker 1: Doom 3 wasn't bad.

256
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,750
Speaker 1: It just wasn't anything.

257
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,970
Speaker 0: It wasn't what we care about.

258
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,250
Speaker 0: It was kind of generic.

259
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:47,690
Speaker 1: So, you know, when they're making rage, it's like, all right, they made Doom 3.

260
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,990
Speaker 1: There's no way that they'll make the same mistake again, right?

261
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,530
Speaker 1: It seems like they did.

262
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,670
Speaker 1: They're going to do their usual huge graphical update.

263
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,910
Speaker 0: Because I have a new policy.

264
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:05,269
Speaker 0: I used to, you know, id FPS is one of those things on the list of games RIM is waiting for that will never come.

265
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,510
Speaker 0: I'm like that dog in Futurama.

266
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,049
Speaker 1: Not anymore.

267
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,990
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, Team Fortress 2, Tribes.

268
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,650
Speaker 1: But it's now it's because everything gets so cheap on Steam eventually.

269
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,109
Speaker 1: And this is a single player game.

270
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,503
Speaker 1: Yep.

271
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,510
Speaker 1: And it's not Half-Life Episode 3.

272
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,749
Speaker 0: I bought the last game I bought right when it came out was Fallout 3 because I was actually really excited about it.

273
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:25,908
Speaker 1: And that was a mistake.

274
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:26,689
Speaker 0: I played it.

275
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,090
Speaker 1: Should have bought the Game of the Year edition.

276
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:28,850
Speaker 0: Yes, I should have.

277
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,289
Speaker 0: The Game of the Year edition has stuff.

278
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:32,788
Speaker 1: Assholes.

279
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,210
Speaker 1: So I don't buy anything when it comes out because A, there's going to be DLCs and B, get away cheap.

280
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,349
Speaker 0: Well, unless I will buy a game when it comes out.

281
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,650
Speaker 1: There's multiplayer activities.

282
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,410
Speaker 0: If there is immediate multiplayer activity that I have to get in on or I will miss it.

283
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,730
Speaker 0: I mean, had I not bought Tribes the day it came out, I would have missed minutes of one of the greatest games ever made never to get them back.

284
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,247
Speaker 1: That's correct.

285
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,769
Speaker 0: Had I not played Counter-Strike in the early beta, I would not be the decade long Counter-Strike player that I am today.

286
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,589
Speaker 1: That is correct.

287
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,070
Speaker 1: But that was free in those days.

288
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:10,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Rage, I'm not missing anything by not buying it now, especially because I might buy a single player game if it comes out.

289
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:15,490
Speaker 0: and the reviews from both people I trust and people I don't trust are glowing.

290
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,650
Speaker 0: But very rarely is that the case.

291
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,129
Speaker 0: Usually the people I don't trust say games are great and the people I trust say they're like incredibly mediocre.

292
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,727
Speaker 0: Nintendo was the last company I would buy games from sight unseen and...

293
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,610
Speaker 1: I ordered Twilight Princess, whatever, not the Twilight Princess, what's the new one?

294
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,170
Speaker 1: Skyward Sword.

295
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, I ordered that.

296
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no Nintendo game is sight unseen for me anymore.

297
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even order a new Kirby one.

298
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,150
Speaker 0: I've been burned too many times.

299
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,569
Speaker 1: I didn't even buy the last Layton, but I might buy the next one.

300
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,249
Speaker 0: Layton I kind of burned out on.

301
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:42,615
Speaker 1: Yeah.

302
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,567
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

303
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:44,128
Speaker 1: I don't know.

304
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,270
Speaker 1: I like to count the matchsticks.

305
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,349
Speaker 0: I do, but the rest of Layton I got kind of sick of.

306
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,970
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the non-matchstick part?

307
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, the non-matchstick, it's like.

308
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,550
Speaker 0: alright, these plots are getting increasingly stupid.

309
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:55,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not the greatest.

310
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:58,009
Speaker 1: The plot of the time travel one was the dumbest.

311
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:02,630
Speaker 0: And their increasing number of bits to twiddle about which I don't give a shit.

312
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the fucking gopher and his little maze.

313
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,370
Speaker 1: Or the hamster.

314
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,750
Speaker 0: It's like dude, I just want to pour water back and forth between the pitchers until Oh my god, if you made a game that was just called water pitchers and it was just...

315
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,730
Speaker 1: And eventually there's like ten pitchers of water.

316
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,470
Speaker 0: On like a three dimensional plane with like a fulcrum somewhere.

317
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,270
Speaker 1: And you actually have to pour the water and you can't spill any.

318
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:22,045
Speaker 0: It's an FPS.

319
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,349
Speaker 0: You're running around on it.

320
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:26,950
Speaker 1: You gotta use portals to move the water.

321
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:28,050
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

322
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,167
Speaker 0: I kind of want that game now.

323
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:39,429
Speaker 0: But no, I have a long... Rage is a game that, go back to a younger, more naive rim, and I would have waited for this game for four years and bought it the day it came out.

324
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:53,509
Speaker 0: But, tribes, every tribes that came after tribes 2, and all the xcoms that came after xcom, and all these games that have just pissed me off or not lived up to what I wanted, especially now that they're not making a multiplayer game that I care about.

325
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,870
Speaker 0: I didn't even buy Rage and the reviews of mediocre, so I don't know.

326
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like it's the same thing as Doom 3.

327
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,569
Speaker 1: Really great graphics and engine and whatever, and typical mediocre, boring, walk around shooting stuff gameplay.

328
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,655
Speaker 0: I mean, Opposable Thumb said, and I quote, "None of the game's ideas are thought out or fully

329
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,142
Speaker 0: explored.".

330
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like John Carmack's not even trying to make games.

331
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,830
Speaker 1: And the thing is, that would be okay if people, you know, if you were making an engine that people actually used, but who used the Doom 3 engine?

332
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,210
Speaker 1: Nobody.

333
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,984
Speaker 0: Not that I know of.

334
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,410
Speaker 0: If they did, it was a real company licensing it for something.

335
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,688
Speaker 0: It wasn't people making awesome mods.

336
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, who's gonna make a game on the Rage engine?

337
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:31,570
Speaker 1: No, not mods, not other, right?

338
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,130
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, look at the old business model.

339
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,430
Speaker 1: Everyone uses the Unreal engine and the Source engine.

340
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:42,287
Speaker 0: Quake 1 and Quake 2 were engines, and there were nominally single player games associated with them.

341
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,008
Speaker 0: But really, the single player games are just there to say, "Hey, check this out,".

342
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,410
Speaker 0: and the real action was in the modding and the multiplayer.

343
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:48,919
Speaker 0: Right.

344
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,449
Speaker 0: Why can't we go back to that?

345
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:52,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

346
00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:01,628
Speaker 0: I mean, why can't id make an FPS with what amounts to a multiplayer tech demo attached to it, and say, "Modders, make this

347
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:01,970
Speaker 0: game.".

348
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:05,790
Speaker 1: I think you can make mods for it, but everyone's just making Source mods.

349
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,749
Speaker 1: Why the fuck do they need to make mods for, you know, Rage?

350
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,889
Speaker 1: Which no one even has.

351
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,966
Speaker 1: People would have to have Rage to make mods for Rage.

352
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:14,830
Speaker 0: I want someone to make the engine.

353
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,190
Speaker 0: Well, I want id to make the engine that is designed for modding.

354
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you gotta compete with the Source engine.

355
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,909
Speaker 0: In fact, you know what I'd say?

356
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:30,830
Speaker 0: Alright, it's ten bucks to get the "game," kind of like how you used to have to buy Half-Life for whatever dollars to then play Counter-Strike, which is a free mod.

357
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:36,390
Speaker 0: If you want the dev kit, which gives you crazy modding support, it's like a hundred bucks.

358
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,810
Speaker 1: The thing is, they gotta have a bunch of resources available.

359
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,189
Speaker 1: They gotta have all the modding tools.

360
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,770
Speaker 1: They gotta have the dedicated server.

361
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:49,089
Speaker 1: They gotta integrate it fully with Steam or something to get the server finder.

362
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,930
Speaker 1: And they gotta have a multiplayer game from day one.

363
00:13:52,431 --> 00:14:01,470
Speaker 0: Oh, also, anyone who uses any matchmaking system that's in a browser or isn't just integrated with Steam, I'm done with you.

364
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,150
Speaker 1: Or, you know, it doesn't suck.

365
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,749
Speaker 0: I'm also done with GameSpy.

366
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:05,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

367
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,984
Speaker 0: Jesus.

368
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,066
Speaker 0: Alright, so Rage is fail.

369
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Rage, it's weird.

370
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,830
Speaker 1: Haven't played it, but all indicators point towards fail.

371
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, especially, here's a quote from Eurogamer.

372
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,110
Speaker 0: "This certainly is a video game like the ones we're used to playing in 2011.

373
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,130
Speaker 0: Smothered and celebrity voice actors and shoulder-grabbingly intense expository scenes, blah, blah, blah.

374
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,642
Speaker 0: Instead, it's something simpler and more

375
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:27,427
Speaker 0: old-fashioned.".

376
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,709
Speaker 0: But yet, that doesn't seem to be what everyone else is saying about it.

377
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

378
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,170
Speaker 0: Like, if it's old-fashioned, I'm thinking, alright, what, Serious Sam?

379
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:37,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

380
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,989
Speaker 0: I mean, old-fashioned means no single-player game.

381
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,374
Speaker 1: Yeah.

382
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,330
Speaker 0: What do they mean, old-fashioned as in, like, 2006?

383
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, I think he means old-fashioned just as in mediocre.

384
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:59,439
Speaker 0: But much more importantly, very briefly, Xenonauts, I've been kind of ignoring, but now it's kind of playable and people have been talking about it, and apparently what everyone who's played it or looked at it said is, "Well, it's

385
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,406
Speaker 0: XCOM.".

386
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:04,349
Speaker 0: And the fact that, until now, no one has made "It's just

387
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:04,570
Speaker 0: XCOM.".

388
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,430
Speaker 1: How many people have tried a bunch of times to make "It's just XCOM"?

389
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:09,365
Speaker 1: And they're all awful.

390
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:14,170
Speaker 1: And they've all failed technologically or made it something awful.

391
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,309
Speaker 0: It's like, how do you fuck that up?

392
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:22,810
Speaker 0: How do you take XCOM, make it into, like, I don't know, a first-person free-space shooter and think that that will trick us?

393
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:23,371
Speaker 0: Right.

394
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:29,009
Speaker 1: But it seems like the Xenonauts people, from what I can tell, have actually made all the XCOM parts.

395
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,749
Speaker 1: They made the spaceship part.

396
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:32,349
Speaker 0: Yup.

397
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,010
Speaker 1: And the, you know, of course, the most important, the tactical squad-based part.

398
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:37,870
Speaker 0: But you need both.

399
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,130
Speaker 1: And the base part.

400
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,570
Speaker 1: It seems like they've made all three parts.

401
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,967
Speaker 0: I'm looking at some screenshots here.

402
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,170
Speaker 0: Mission successful when you beat a mission.

403
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:45,790
Speaker 0: Let's see, UFO secured, zero.

404
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,870
Speaker 0: Five aliens killed, plus five.

405
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,270
Speaker 0: Guard corpses destroyed.

406
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:52,589
Speaker 0: Alien plasma clip, four.

407
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:53,489
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

408
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,249
Speaker 1: This is exactly... That's XCOM.

409
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:55,886
Speaker 1: Yup.

410
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,499
Speaker 1: Are there fucking mind control?

411
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,868
Speaker 0: shit fuckers all blown around?

412
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:07,390
Speaker 0: Oh, and there's a screenshot of a dude standing there, and you put weapons in his hands, and the guy's got M4 in his left hand and M4 in his right hand.

413
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,407
Speaker 1: You can't hold two M4s.

414
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:09,569
Speaker 1: You can.

415
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:10,329
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

416
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:11,980
Speaker 1: But...

417
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,259
Speaker 0: I haven't played this, but...

418
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:15,470
Speaker 1: You have high hopes.

419
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,650
Speaker 0: I do have high hopes.

420
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,906
Speaker 1: Indicators point towards yes.

421
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:19,670
Speaker 0: And here's why I brought...

422
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,669
Speaker 1: Magic 8-Ball says...

423
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,530
Speaker 0: Here's why I brought both of these up.

424
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,748
Speaker 0: I'm not speaking for every other gamer out there, because I understand that people have different tastes, and...

425
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:31,750
Speaker 1: Some people don't like games, they just want to watch movies where you push buttons once in a while.

426
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:46,270
Speaker 0: It is also easy for me to say that games are good or bad, because they're to my taste, but I can understand why some kinds of games that I like and wish would be made don't appeal to anyone reasonable.

427
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,229
Speaker 1: They don't have skills.

428
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,410
Speaker 0: Or brains.

429
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,069
Speaker 0: Not just that.

430
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,170
Speaker 0: It's got Mega TF, or, you know, like, Weapons Factory.

431
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,549
Speaker 1: It's horrendously unpolished.

432
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:02,110
Speaker 1: Those games, even if they were polished, are so complicated that I... People who aren't smart enough can't play them.

433
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:07,170
Speaker 0: I might not be able to play them, because if someone made a new one of those, I zoom back to my life, right?

434
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,410
Speaker 0: How did I get good at Mega TF and Weapons Factory?

435
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:15,769
Speaker 0: By playing them for, like, 40 hours a week for months on end.

436
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are people... I'm not talking about people who don't like Mega TF.

437
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,429
Speaker 1: I'm talking about people who don't like Counter-Strike.

438
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:22,384
Speaker 1: It's like, "Okay,

439
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:22,667
Speaker 1: dude.".

440
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,049
Speaker 0: But I can understand why people might not like games like that, but they die instantly because they suck.

441
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,570
Speaker 0: For me, personally, my tastes, and if your tastes align with mine, they don't need to make any new games.

442
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:38,230
Speaker 0: There are enough old games that just need to be remade pretty much the same.

443
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,490
Speaker 1: To update them to modern technology so they work on modern computers smoothly with a good interface at full resolution.

444
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,662
Speaker 0: And I think there is money in this.

445
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:52,809
Speaker 0: Ask any gamer who self-identifies as a gamer who's over the age of, like, 17, like, "Hey, would you play XCOM if they made another

446
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:52,970
Speaker 0: one?".

447
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,286
Speaker 0: And they'd probably say... No, like, they'd probably start salivating.

448
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,265
Speaker 1: Go ask an 18-year-old and be like, "What's

449
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:57,670
Speaker 1: XCOM?".

450
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:57,774
Speaker 0: Nah.

451
00:17:58,939 --> 00:17:59,370
Speaker 0: It depends.

452
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,490
Speaker 0: A lot of people know XCOM, because, you know, girl games, people keep playing it.

453
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,770
Speaker 1: I mean, even, like, my brother is only four years younger than me.

454
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,789
Speaker 1: He probably doesn't know what XCOM is.

455
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,890
Speaker 0: They might know the new Xcoms that really suck.

456
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:14,770
Speaker 0: Even the original sequel to XCOM, which was made by mostly the same studio, was terrible.

457
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,810
Speaker 0: And it was just the same game, just worse.

458
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,130
Speaker 1: I might go home and play some XCOM.

459
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,410
Speaker 1: Except I'm going to go home and play some Counter-Strike and stuff.

460
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:23,810
Speaker 0: I'm going to install XCOM on my laptop.

461
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,768
Speaker 1: Oh, laptop games, good idea.

462
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck yeah, and DOSBox?

463
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, good idea.

464
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:29,650
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I could play that on the subway.

465
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:30,169
Speaker 0: I might.

466
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,245
Speaker 1: Anyway, there is a game coming out called Risk.

467
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:52,170
Speaker 0: Now, funnily enough, people on the internet think that I knew about this game and already had an opinion about it, because there was a Twitter conversation, and I just saw, like, someone added me at one point, and said something about persistence in games or something, and I responded with, you know, a generic statement.

468
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:02,110
Speaker 0: I didn't look at the history and realize that they were actually talking about this Risk game, and their responses made me realize that I had responded to a conversation.

469
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,407
Speaker 0: I had no idea what they were talking about, and I looked into it.

470
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:08,530
Speaker 0: But someone, people were emailing me and thought I was being all insightful.

471
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,450
Speaker 0: I had no idea what you were talking about.

472
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,590
Speaker 0: But anyway, I didn't know anything about this game.

473
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,010
Speaker 1: So there's a game coming out called Risk.

474
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,309
Speaker 1: It's the same Risk that you played in the olden days, you know?

475
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,170
Speaker 1: Roll five red dice against some white ones, attacker wins.

476
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,050
Speaker 0: Well, sort of, because they've done something neat.

477
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:24,910
Speaker 0: Something kind of unique.

478
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:25,354
Speaker 1: Something.

479
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,010
Speaker 1: So this Risk is called Risk Legacy.

480
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,008
Speaker 1: And unlike Halo Risk, which we still didn't play, or Risk 2010 with the nukes or whatever, this is Risk Legacy.

481
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,410
Speaker 1: And the way this works is, number one, it's got mechs and shit, which I guess is stylistically good, even though it doesn't make the game any better.

482
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,190
Speaker 1: But two, is it has persistence.

483
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,150
Speaker 1: Now, on the one hand, we always fucking complain about persistence in all the games.

484
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,570
Speaker 0: No, no, we don't in all the games, Scott.

485
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,349
Speaker 0: Here's an example of a game where we don't complain about it.

486
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,308
Speaker 0: Burning a wheel.

487
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:56,750
Speaker 1: Well, but that is not a competitive game, that is a role-playing game.

488
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,990
Speaker 0: Ah, but it could be competitive.

489
00:19:58,854 --> 00:19:59,509
Speaker 1: That would be lame.

490
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,449
Speaker 0: No, it depends.

491
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:13,909
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know, but in all the games, we complain about the role-playing video games not having enough persistence, like the MMOs, and we complain about the competitive games having too much persistence, like the TF2 and the MMOs with the PVP.

492
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:24,170
Speaker 1: Yet here we go, the first instance of the persistence in the board game, and not a tabletop role-playing game, a tabletop board game that is competitive, Risk Legacy.

493
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:31,487
Speaker 1: Basically, the deal with this game is, every time you play this game, there are certain things that might happen, which will change, quote, "the

494
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:31,810
Speaker 1: world.".

495
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:42,650
Speaker 1: So you might put stickers on the board that permanently change the map, or you might tear up cards so that they can never be used again in the game, or you might cross something out with a marker so that it can never happen again or the rules change forever.

496
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,050
Speaker 1: So the next time you play the game, it's different, and the next time you play the game, it's different.

497
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,901
Speaker 1: Now, obviously this raised some concerns.

498
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,290
Speaker 1: Number one, what if you want to reset that shit?

499
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,410
Speaker 1: Well, people are going to put their stickers on cards, and they're going to put the cards out in places.

500
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,350
Speaker 0: Yup, now I want to jump in right now, Scott and I have been talking about this at length.

501
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:02,010
Speaker 0: For a game like this, it's a board game, it's not that expensive.

502
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,512
Speaker 0: You know what?

503
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:03,737
Speaker 0: Just go for it.

504
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:09,910
Speaker 0: Just go in and play the game the way it's designed, and just go for it, because it's going to be way more epic.

505
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:16,770
Speaker 0: The point of this game, to make it a board game, I think, is not to have a game you play and preserve or whatever.

506
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,550
Speaker 0: When you finish, you're done with this game, you've played it all the way through with your friends over the course of a year.

507
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:29,770
Speaker 0: The board that remains and the torn up remains of those pieces and those cards is like the testament of your world.

508
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,330
Speaker 0: Like, that is the story of your game.

509
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,370
Speaker 1: As a role-playing game, that's kind of great, but as a competitive game, you can't take it seriously.

510
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,053
Speaker 1: But you know what?

511
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,906
Speaker 1: In this case, it's okay.

512
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:40,429
Speaker 1: You know why?

513
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,390
Speaker 1: Because risk at its root can't be taken seriously.

514
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:51,290
Speaker 1: So to make a game that you can't take seriously competitively and add this persistence to it, well, it doesn't ruin it because it's already crap.

515
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,129
Speaker 1: It's like, you added poop to my smelly poop.

516
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,340
Speaker 0: But it's not just that.

517
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,270
Speaker 1: It's already poop, dude.

518
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,165
Speaker 0: It's more that it's bridging something into war games.

519
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:13,830
Speaker 0: that's interesting, where it's kind of, you're interacting in this world, and basically, this is a board game you can play once, but it's not persistent like if you added leveling up to Counter-Strike, where you've removed the stateless competition.

520
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,390
Speaker 0: The competition is who comes out on top in the end of this series of risk games.

521
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,970
Speaker 0: It's like a tournament in a box.

522
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,653
Speaker 1: But here's the thing.

523
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:26,350
Speaker 1: Number one, what if you play it once, and then someone else plays it, and you both permanently affect it?

524
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,630
Speaker 1: Well, now you don't know what the second guys did, so they had to write a quest log or something.

525
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,072
Speaker 0: Well, no.

526
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:31,590
Speaker 0: My take on this, and I haven't played it yet.

527
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,061
Speaker 1: Two, what if you run out it?

528
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,330
Speaker 1: Like, you've torn up all the cards.

529
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:36,450
Speaker 1: If the game can't be played anymore, then what?

530
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:41,730
Speaker 1: No board game I have can be played out to the point where you can't physically play it anymore.

531
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,610
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's possible with this game.

532
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:45,049
Speaker 0: I think it is, but here's the thing.

533
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,276
Speaker 1: But that kind of sucks.

534
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:49,489
Speaker 1: You bought a game, and now you just can't play it anymore, because you've torn up all the pieces.

535
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time, how much more visceral is it when you pick up a new card that you have?

536
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,409
Speaker 0: No one else even knows it exists, because you opened the seal and looked at it, because you found it somewhere.

537
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:06,290
Speaker 0: And in the middle of one game, you show it to everyone, you nuke a part of the board, and you rip that fucker up and throw it in their faces.

538
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,930
Speaker 1: See, that was something that they probably don't have in this game, which could be cool, right?

539
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,170
Speaker 1: Is, you know, they've probably got a bunch of stuff where you permanently change the board.

540
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,450
Speaker 0: No, Scott, they do have locked off things that are unknown and are revealed by conditions.

541
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,148
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

542
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,230
Speaker 1: Oh, see, I was just going to suggest that, not knowing it was in there, but that's awesome.

543
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,068
Speaker 0: I went over the list.

544
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,810
Speaker 1: You open the game, there's like an envelope, and you don't open the envelope until the time you open it up, and suddenly there's a surprise.

545
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,010
Speaker 0: I have not seen the game yet, but I've read the list.

546
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,550
Speaker 1: How awesome would it be if those surprises were different in different boxes?

547
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,290
Speaker 0: Oh my god, then the nerds would go crazy, because everyone who plays and actually tears it up is killing a collector somewhere.

548
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,190
Speaker 1: And what if it was like randomized, so like magic cards?

549
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,057
Speaker 0: But, think about what this does.

550
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:49,170
Speaker 0: I want to talk a little bit about game mechanics and mechanism design.

551
00:23:49,770 --> 00:24:03,270
Speaker 0: So, when you play Risk or Shogun, aka Samurai Swords, you know, any of those games, where one of the problems is that, you know, they're not cooperative games, in that you can't make a binding deal, or even diplomacy.

552
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,750
Speaker 0: You have to enforce deals in the context of one game.

553
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:17,570
Speaker 0: There's no reason not to fucking betray people, because at the end of the game you start a new game, and holding someone's betrayal in a previous game, of a stateless game like that against them, doesn't really make sense.

554
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,748
Speaker 0: Especially, you know, a good player like me betrays or doesn't betray randomly, about 50% of the time.

555
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,370
Speaker 1: And also based on, you know, the situation on the board.

556
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:35,730
Speaker 0: Now, imagine instead a game like this, where you and four other people, let's say, are playing this box through, over time.

557
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:42,270
Speaker 0: If I betray you, you taking that into account is contextual, in all the future games.

558
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:50,330
Speaker 0: So, alliances, they're still not cooperative, in that you still have to enforce alliances with force, in the context of the game.

559
00:24:50,970 --> 00:25:02,210
Speaker 0: You have such greater opportunity to do so, that suddenly diplomacy matters a whole lot, where, in real risk, if diplomacy matters, your friends are idiots, or you're being tricked.

560
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,509
Speaker 1: Yep, but despite all that, this is still risk.

561
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:06,250
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

562
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:07,710
Speaker 1: Which is problem.

563
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:14,588
Speaker 0: But, I will admit, as much, you know, we think about games a lot, we talk about them a lot, we lecture on them at, like, PAX.

564
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:20,150
Speaker 0: I had never considered making a board game permanent or statefully.

565
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,697
Speaker 1: Never?

566
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:21,770
Speaker 1: This is a genius idea.

567
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,290
Speaker 1: And you know what I think we need to do, to make this idea to its full potential?

568
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:26,730
Speaker 0: Do it with a game that isn't risk?

569
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,650
Speaker 1: Let's do it with fucking Small World slash whatever.

570
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,275
Speaker 1: As opposed to risk.

571
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:33,550
Speaker 1: Imagine that, you're playing Small World, right?

572
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:54,450
Speaker 1: Someone breaks out, like, demon something, you find out that when that combination happens, then suddenly, like, you know, you open up, like, you know, the demons come out from hell or something, and now there's a new area on the board that's forever there, and now there's demons coming out every turn or some shit, and, you know, this mountain is now a plane, it exploded, it's now a volcano.

573
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,112
Speaker 0: The fact that this game came out, and I'm gonna do some press stuff, I

574
00:25:58,253 --> 00:25:59,438
Speaker 1: wanna talk to the people,

575
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:08,630
Speaker 0: I wanna talk to the people who designed it, for real, I wanna get some interviews with them, because this unlocked an area, like, I'm already writing, like, panels based on this concept.

576
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's designed by Rob Daviau.

577
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,380
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the same Rob Daviau.

578
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,809
Speaker 1: I follow on Twitter, it might be.

579
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,490
Speaker 1: There's also another guy, Chris Dupuis.

580
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,030
Speaker 0: It appears to be not available on Amazon, so I'm gonna go to, like, the complete strat tomorrow and try to pick it up.

581
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:22,472
Speaker 0: Yeah.

582
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,289
Speaker 1: Hopefully, though, it says playing time 60 minutes.

583
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,788
Speaker 1: That's, I've never seen a risk that takes 60 minutes.

584
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,968
Speaker 1: If that's true, it might actually be feasible for us to play this, like, 10 times or so.

585
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,350
Speaker 0: You know, risk does only take about an hour if nobody is a slow dumbass.

586
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,030
Speaker 1: Right, but the thing is, how would this work, it says three to five players, so we can't, we need another person, at least.

587
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:46,308
Speaker 0: We gotta get a set of five people who are willing to play this with us on a regular basis.

588
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:46,850
Speaker 0: to completion.

589
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,089
Speaker 1: On the Wednesday night gaming?

590
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:50,950
Speaker 0: Maybe, because the Wednesday night gaming doesn't have a lot of people coming.

591
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:52,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

592
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,010
Speaker 0: Anyway.

593
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:53,908
Speaker 0: Anyway.

594
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,340
Speaker 0: So anyway, things of the day.

595
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,479
Speaker 1: Oh, we got some good things of the day right here for you.

596
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,036
Speaker 0: I think we do.

597
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:08,400
Speaker 1: I've been digging deeper down the internet holes to find some gems lately.

598
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,640
Speaker 0: Well, I learned something recently.

599
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,441
Speaker 0: You see, I like musicals, and I'm a big fan of 1776.

600
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,040
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

601
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,220
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of charm.

602
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,263
Speaker 0: Like, it's not good.

603
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:24,640
Speaker 0: in the same way that, like, Rent or Les Mis is good, but it's good in this, like, I think it's better than Rent.

604
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,100
Speaker 0: Have you seen Rent?

605
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:26,914
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,018
Speaker 0: I don't know.

607
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:32,420
Speaker 0: It's not bad in that the writing's a little derpy at times, but it's very endearing.

608
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,160
Speaker 0: It's witty funny instead of, like, guffaw funny.

609
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,820
Speaker 1: I prefer the witty funny.

610
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,700
Speaker 0: The acting's great, too.

611
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,340
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I had seen 1776, like, a decade ago, and, you know, that was the last time I'd seen it.

612
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:54,587
Speaker 0: And apparently, in between the last time I had seen it, and when some friends of ours brought it over to watch together the other night, I have to watch it.

613
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,660
Speaker 1: I haven't watched it in a hundred years.

614
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,240
Speaker 0: A song I did not know existed that had been cut from the original had been re-added.

615
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:02,760
Speaker 1: Oh, snap.

616
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,519
Speaker 0: And there's a story.

617
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,740
Speaker 1: But is this one of those cases?

618
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,940
Speaker 1: The thing is, usually, when something is cut, it's like it should have been cut, right?

619
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:16,039
Speaker 1: For example, you watch those Futurama outtakes, and it's like, "Yeah, I see where they were going with that joke, but I'm glad they took it out of the episode because it doesn't belong in

620
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,180
Speaker 1: there.".

621
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:17,102
Speaker 0: Ah, but no.

622
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:25,180
Speaker 0: It turns out that Richard Nixon himself wanted this song removed because it was patently offensive.

623
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,631
Speaker 0: In fact, he ordered that the negatives be destroyed, and supposedly, the director-- Uh, that's censorship.

624
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,300
Speaker 1: That's not allowed.

625
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,527
Speaker 0: Ah, no, because it wasn't an order as in "By Force of

626
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:37,868
Speaker 0: Law."

627
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:41,979
Speaker 0: It was as in, "Yeah, or, uh, that's a nice movie you got

628
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:42,239
Speaker 0: there.".

629
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:43,025
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

630
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,139
Speaker 1: All right.

631
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,320
Speaker 0: Here, I'll just read the paragraph from Wikipedia.

632
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,860
Speaker 0: The song "Cool, Cool, Considerate Men" depicts Revolutionary War-era conservatives as power-hungry weedlers focused on maintaining wealth.

633
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,035
Speaker 0: According to Jack Warner, the film's producer and friend of U.S.

634
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:06,400
Speaker 0: President Richard Nixon, Nixon pressured him to cut the song in the 1972 film version of the show, which Warner did.

635
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,020
Speaker 1: No, pressured him, so it wasn't censorship.

636
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Speaker 1: Nixon apparently saw the song-- His friend pushed him around.

637
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, as an insult to the conservatives in his time, which it definitely was.

638
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,004
Speaker 0: Yes.

639
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,846
Speaker 0: Conservatives of all time.

640
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,355
Speaker 0: It's a fantastic song.

641
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:33,100
Speaker 1: Like, it is-- It was striking how relevant, not just that song, but actually all of 1776 is-- I don't understand why people are continuously surprised when they look at history and they see the exact same problem of today repeated in the past.

642
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,460
Speaker 1: It's like, were you not paying attention?

643
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,173
Speaker 1: Was it not-- History has been the same story for centuries and fond centuries.

644
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:40,760
Speaker 1: Nothing has fucking changed.

645
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:51,500
Speaker 0: It's like people continuously, A, are surprised that the past was the same as today, and B-- Scott, was it not Julius Caesar who went to war with Gaul after tricking the Senate into thinking that they were a threat?

646
00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:04,620
Speaker 1: And B, not only are they continuously surprised that the past had the same problems as the present, you know, government and politics-wise, but also, B, are so naïve to think that their time in which they live is the time at which it will change.

647
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,180
Speaker 1: Or that it will ever change.

648
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,119
Speaker 1: So anyway-- Just like the people who think the world will end in their lifetime.

649
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,460
Speaker 0: So Nixon and Jack Warner also ordered the negative of the song to be shredded, so it would never be seen by anyone.

650
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:20,220
Speaker 0: And the editor secretly kept it intact, and it was re-added to the remastered DVDs.

651
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Speaker 1: George Lucas, take a fucking lesson.

652
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:29,500
Speaker 0: So, this song is now, like, one of my favorite songs in 1776 because-- Well, I mean, the content of the song is excellent.

653
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,716
Speaker 0: No, but it's also a really good song.

654
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,588
Speaker 1: Well, the song is an okay song.

655
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:34,760
Speaker 1: I actually prefer some of the other songs.

656
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:37,061
Speaker 0: What's your favorite song in 1776?

657
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:46,760
Speaker 1: I do not know because it has been so long, but I remember-- It's either Homicide or the slave song at the end.

658
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,300
Speaker 1: I have very little memory because it has been so many ages.

659
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,387
Speaker 0: You should watch it again.

660
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:53,260
Speaker 0: I think we could do a show on 1776.

661
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,940
Speaker 1: I think so as well, but I just remember there being incredibly catchy songs, and I also remember that this song, it was just like, okay, that's funny.

662
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:02,620
Speaker 0: Also, critics hated 1776.

663
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:02,692
Speaker 1: Why?

664
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,610
Speaker 0: Quote the New York Times, "The music is resutely unmemorable.

665
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,158
Speaker 0: The lyrics sound as if they'd been written by someone high on root

666
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:09,359
Speaker 0: beer.".

667
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,100
Speaker 1: It's better to see it on Broadway on stage than the movie, I think.

668
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Speaker 0: I think the movie's great, though, because it has some really high-caliber actors and some pretty great stage cinematography.

669
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:19,918
Speaker 0: Ebert hated it, too.

670
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:20,626
Speaker 1: Really?

671
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:20,950
Speaker 1: What did he say?

672
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,959
Speaker 0: He said, "This is an insult to the real men who were Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, and the

673
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,080
Speaker 0: rest.".

674
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:26,566
Speaker 1: What?

675
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:27,760
Speaker 1: That's the point.

676
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:29,725
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

677
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:33,760
Speaker 0: I get the impression that this is a surprisingly and scarily accurate representation of what they were like.

678
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Speaker 1: I think it's one of those things where in some ways it's clearly more accurate than a history book, and in some ways not, right?

679
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,526
Speaker 1: It's like- Yeah.

680
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,130
Speaker 0: Anyway.

681
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,379
Speaker 1: So, I have something really awesome for you.

682
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:47,137
Speaker 0: Oh, do you?

683
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,927
Speaker 1: This is MC Hammer.

684
00:31:50,348 --> 00:31:51,391
Speaker 1: Except not.

685
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:54,260
Speaker 1: This is MC Hammer if he was Japanese.

686
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,060
Speaker 1: This is- It is so epic.

687
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,025
Speaker 0: This is pretty great.

688
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,536
Speaker 0: I defy you to get a bunch of friends.

689
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:00,320
Speaker 0: Don't watch the video.

690
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,080
Speaker 0: Get a bunch of friends together, turn it on, and just watch it, and have a bet the first person to laugh owes everyone else five bucks.

691
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is a lot of times people are able to keep from laughing.

692
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,378
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't even keep from laughing on the-.

693
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:13,099
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

694
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,480
Speaker 1: Yes, I can.

695
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:13,979
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

696
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,460
Speaker 0: I have to do a video challenge.

697
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,221
Speaker 1: Sure.

698
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:26,420
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you go around the internet, actually, we've done a lot of research into the openers and closers and various television shows, movies, and things in other languages.

699
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:37,060
Speaker 1: But here is a new area in which is, you know, hit pop songs or hit songs that are re-sung in other languages by cover bands.

700
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,640
Speaker 1: Not only, you know, but translated into the other languages.

701
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:45,620
Speaker 1: And there is a goldmine out there, especially, of course, the land of Japan where everything crazy and hilarious comes from.

702
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:47,019
Speaker 1: But other countries as well.

703
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,080
Speaker 1: You know, you can go and look for, say, Italian Rolling Stones and see what comes up.

704
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,950
Speaker 1: I just pulled that out of the air.

705
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:54,720
Speaker 1: I don't know if that exists.

706
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,560
Speaker 1: But, you know, some people, of course, in other countries, just listen to songs in English.

707
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,300
Speaker 1: But there are many instances of songs translated and much humor can be had, especially if a music video was produced.

708
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,840
Speaker 0: So anyway, very briefly, in the meta moment, the Book Club book, for which there will be an episode shortly, was The Ear, The Eye, The Arm by Nancy Farmer.

709
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,180
Speaker 0: The next book is Scott's Choice, which has not been announced yet.

710
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,560
Speaker 1: You'll find out in the Ear, The Eye, The Arm episode.

711
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,560
Speaker 0: Is that like Sophie's Choice?

712
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:19,394
Speaker 0: No.

713
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:19,784
Speaker 0: No?

714
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,183
Speaker 0: No.

715
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,619
Speaker 0: Do you have any idea what you're going to pick?

716
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:23,100
Speaker 1: I'm having some ideas.

717
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,320
Speaker 1: I'm thinking, what do you think, a possible double book?

718
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,319
Speaker 0: Double book.

719
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,278
Speaker 0: That's...

720
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
Speaker 1: And they're both small books.

721
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,179
Speaker 0: But you realize...

722
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,219
Speaker 1: They add up to be...

723
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,460
Speaker 0: Scott, I will warn you of one thing and one thing only.

724
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,668
Speaker 0: Yep.

725
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,640
Speaker 0: Double book, should you do it, sets a precedent and I choose after you.

726
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,900
Speaker 1: But here's the thing about double book is that they're a too tiny book.

727
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,440
Speaker 1: I'm not doing double book like War and Peace followed by, you know, what's the book you love so much?

728
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:50,839
Speaker 0: The Count of Monte Cristo.

729
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,180
Speaker 1: I'm not doing Count of Monte Cristo, War and Peace double book.

730
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,219
Speaker 1: I'm doing like Hop on Pop followed by Cat in the Hat double book.

731
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:58,560
Speaker 0: Alright, alright.

732
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,307
Speaker 1: You know, I mean if I did Dr.

733
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,060
Speaker 1: Seuss top ten, that would count as one book, am I right?

734
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:11,580
Speaker 1: You know, so if one of the books takes two hours to read and the other book, you know, takes two hours to read, I think that's okay as a double book.

735
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,969
Speaker 0: If you will be at the New York Comic Con or the Anime Ghetto inside of the New York Comic Con, we will be there as a...

736
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,536
Speaker 1: Normal people.

737
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:19,407
Speaker 0: Well, nope, nope.

738
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,940
Speaker 0: Scott will be a normal person.

739
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,480
Speaker 0: I'm press and Emily's a professional.

740
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,818
Speaker 1: I'm actually thinking about spending some time.

741
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,780
Speaker 0: And if Scott had any goddamn patience, he would have also had a press badge, but no, he bought a badge instead of waiting for me to sort out paperwork.

742
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,620
Speaker 1: Well, I figured worst case, I thought you were still going to do the paperwork.

743
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:34,395
Speaker 0: I did it.

744
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:35,199
Speaker 0: Alright.

745
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,960
Speaker 0: And I got a badge, but since you already had a badge, I only got one.

746
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,440
Speaker 1: Oh, but I was saying if you got two, I was planning to give mine away as like a prize or something.

747
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:44,719
Speaker 0: I might be able to get you one.

748
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:45,239
Speaker 0: Alright, well.

749
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,920
Speaker 0: It's a little late in the game.

750
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,100
Speaker 1: I know, but that was my, I thought, I didn't know that you, I thought I had under the impression that you had tried to get two and got one.

751
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,790
Speaker 0: I had not tried to do anything.

752
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,018
Speaker 0: I just, I do or do not.

753
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,059
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

754
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:56,677
Speaker 1: Anyway, so.

755
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,199
Speaker 1: Either way, I got a badge.

756
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:11,320
Speaker 0: But we will not be presenting at the Con because as far as I can tell, the only panels that are like what the lectures we do are on a stage in a public area, like the place where Star Wars people fight.

757
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:13,039
Speaker 0: I don't know.

758
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,780
Speaker 0: I'm going to reserve my judgment of the content of the panels at this Con until we attend.

759
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,477
Speaker 1: Until I see it, yeah.

760
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,540
Speaker 0: It's not to look so good.

761
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,580
Speaker 0: In the immortal words of Mario, it's not to look so good.

762
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,780
Speaker 1: I am actually going to spend some time at this convention because it only takes a few hours to go see everything.

763
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,980
Speaker 1: I'm actually going to spend some time, A, I'm going to try to see a couple famous people like Frank Miller.

764
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,819
Speaker 1: I just want to see him.

765
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,459
Speaker 0: You want to see him?

766
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,740
Speaker 0: I can put a slot in for a press interview.

767
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:37,480
Speaker 1: Eh, maybe.

768
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:38,419
Speaker 0: Also.

769
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,851
Speaker 0: I might demand an interview with the Dr.

770
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,400
Speaker 0: McNinja guy just so I can be like, hey.

771
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can try to interview all the low hanging fruits like that.

772
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,840
Speaker 1: And then B, I'm actually going to spend some time sitting on the floor digging through comic boxes looking for some old ass comics that are missing.

773
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, some gems.

774
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,620
Speaker 1: Looking for the buried treasure.

775
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:57,361
Speaker 1: Like, and you can do Kids on the Block #2.

776
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:05,480
Speaker 0: I'm going to do something because last time I have all this video of I walked around the Con on Saturday and Sunday and the vast majority of the panel rooms were empty except for the people presenting.

777
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,200
Speaker 0: So I want to see if the same thing happens this year.

778
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,239
Speaker 1: We should make an expose.

779
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,098
Speaker 1: Like, look at these fucking empty panel rooms.

780
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:11,636
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

781
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:16,280
Speaker 0: I'll be there Thursday and we'll be there probably some points of Friday and Saturday.

782
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,500
Speaker 0: I don't know if we'll actually...

783
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,940
Speaker 1: I'm actually going to take the day off work Friday just because I can.

784
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,039
Speaker 1: I'll stroll over there late.

785
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,900
Speaker 1: Take a nice long morning sleep.

786
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,598
Speaker 1: You know, hang out.

787
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,199
Speaker 1: Meet some people I meet there.

788
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,880
Speaker 1: Maybe get some arts from the Artist Alley.

789
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,079
Speaker 0: Some of you have emailed us.

790
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,960
Speaker 0: If you want to hang out, you know, we'll be around the Con.

791
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:31,998
Speaker 0: We'll play it by air.

792
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,959
Speaker 1: Keep it loose.

793
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:35,699
Speaker 1: Use the Twitters to find us and such.

794
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,096
Speaker 1: Alright.

795
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:41,199
Speaker 0: We will be at and I highly recommend you also be at Magfest next year.

796
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,540
Speaker 0: It's not a convention.

797
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,819
Speaker 1: It's not that far away because it's already rocked over.

798
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:45,420
Speaker 0: It's January.

799
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:45,958
Speaker 0: You know what?

800
00:36:46,282 --> 00:36:47,599
Speaker 0: I think the hotel might sell out.

801
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:47,960
Speaker 0: Yup.

802
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:51,860
Speaker 1: Be just quick to end this meta minute which is suddenly becoming the meta hour.

803
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:55,600
Speaker 1: You should check us out on the internets and all the places we are on the internets.

804
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,080
Speaker 1: Facebook.

805
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,511
Speaker 1: Twitter.

00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:57,599
Speaker 1: Frontroadcrew.com.

807
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,959
Speaker 1: Frontroadcrew.com.

Speaker 1: Etc.

Speaker 1: Etc.

810
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,819
Speaker 1: And I just want to remind everyone, nothing to do with us.

811
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:05,999
Speaker 1: It is October, which means only one thing.

812
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,177
Speaker 0: Applebuckin?

813
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:07,734
Speaker 1: No.

814
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,079
Speaker 0: Uh, pumpkin pie?

815
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:09,574
Speaker 1: No.

816
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,760
Speaker 0: Monster Madness!

817
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,934
Speaker 0: Oh shit, that started three days ago!

818
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:16,839
Speaker 1: I already watched.

819
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,739
Speaker 1: I didn't watch today's yet.

820
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,257
Speaker 1: What's the theme?

821
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:18,919
Speaker 0: What's the theme?

822
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:21,320
Speaker 1: Every week is another set of sequels.

823
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,580
Speaker 1: So week one is all Frankenstein sequels.

824
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,920
Speaker 1: We're going to see what week two is probably going to be all Dracula.

825
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,460
Speaker 1: I'm guessing it's probably going to be all Freddy one week.

826
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,197
Speaker 1: Something like that.

827
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,280
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's sequelitis on cinemassacre.com Monster Madness.

828
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,339
Speaker 1: If you haven't watched Monster Madness, go back, watch all the old Monster Madness from the beginning.

829
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,320
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I am so pumped about this.

830
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:41,718
Speaker 1: I know.

831
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,640
Speaker 1: I forgot about it.

832
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,520
Speaker 1: Don't forget to go to cinemassacre.com every single day of the month in October.

833
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,076
Speaker 1: Go to cinemassacre.com.

834
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,360
Speaker 0: So, Rock of Ages.

835
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:01,380
Speaker 0: It's a game that you might have watched the trailer.

836
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,380
Speaker 0: We talked about it before.

837
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,380
Speaker 1: It's Monkey Ball plus Tower Defense.

838
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,559
Speaker 1: Monkey Ball Defense.

839
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,860
Speaker 0: With Monty Python-esque animation and art.

840
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:09,740
Speaker 1: The art is stunning.

841
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,980
Speaker 1: I just got to say right, the Terry Gilliam style of graphic design going on in this game.

842
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:16,280
Speaker 0: And I'm a big fan of that.

843
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,660
Speaker 1: Excellent.

844
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,399
Speaker 1: And also the history plus mythology that goes into it.

845
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:21,520
Speaker 1: But coupled with.

846
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:22,516
Speaker 1: Muy excellente.

847
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,420
Speaker 1: It's the history and all that.

848
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,860
Speaker 1: Mario says this is looking very good.

849
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:33,178
Speaker 0: Coupled with Monty Python-esque humor of fart noises when you crush Charlemagne and things like that.

850
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,100
Speaker 0: It's, I love the eek they make when you bust into their chambers.

851
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,080
Speaker 1: And the way they wiggle her ass.

852
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,220
Speaker 0: But I wish they ran away.

853
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,580
Speaker 1: Ten style points for Rock of Ages.

854
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,180
Speaker 0: So, we won't review the style because it's great.

855
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,260
Speaker 1: There's not really that much to say about it except for amazing style.

856
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:52,160
Speaker 0: The single player game plot is your Sisyphus.

857
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,679
Speaker 0: I think you can figure it out from there.

858
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:57,520
Speaker 1: If you don't know who Sisyphus is, stop listening to Geek Nights.

859
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, go, go.

860
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,020
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't need to be a mythology expert.

861
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,400
Speaker 1: But I mean, all I know is Sisyphus pushed the rock up the hill.

862
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,618
Speaker 0: Sisyphus in the very least.

863
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,820
Speaker 1: That's all you got to know.

864
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,239
Speaker 0: Well, no, he didn't actually push it up the hill.

865
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, he tried.

866
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:09,900
Speaker 1: He tried.

867
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,900
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this game came out early September, about a month ago.

868
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,040
Speaker 1: It's ten bucks on Steam.

869
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Speaker 1: I'm sure during the Steam holiday sale it'll be much cheaper.

870
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:19,839
Speaker 1: Maybe buy it then if you really want to.

871
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,160
Speaker 1: It's also on the Xbox.

872
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:22,720
Speaker 1: I wouldn't buy it on Xbox.

873
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,540
Speaker 1: If something's available on Steam and Xbox, I'd always pick Steam.

874
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,160
Speaker 1: But that's because I have a computer connected to my TV.

875
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,199
Speaker 1: If you are dumb and don't have a computer connected to your TV and you don't have wireless Xbox controllers for your computer, maybe you should buy it on Xbox.

876
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:37,599
Speaker 1: And that sucks.

877
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:38,700
Speaker 1: Anyway.

878
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:50,040
Speaker 0: So, the gameplay, as far as we can tell from the trailer, was that you build tower defense style defenses and you alternate between that and monkey balling a rock into someone's gates.

879
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically you start the game and there's a big ramp, right?

880
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,678
Speaker 1: Monkey ball style.

881
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,179
Speaker 1: And at the end of the ramp is a gate.

882
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,880
Speaker 1: And when that gate is smashed open, your character is in that gate and he's going to get squished and then you lose.

883
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:11,640
Speaker 1: So there's two symmetrically opposed ramps with gates at either end and you take turns rolling a rock down this ramp, monkey ball style.

884
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,280
Speaker 1: Now, the controls are pretty good.

885
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:15,880
Speaker 1: They're smooth, but they're not monkey ball smooth.

886
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,600
Speaker 0: They're very, like, full of momentum.

887
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,080
Speaker 0: It is very hard to turn your rock.

888
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,040
Speaker 1: And the camera control is not ideal either.

889
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,460
Speaker 1: It's kind of loosey goosey and you can never quite get the camera exactly where you want it.

890
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:34,700
Speaker 1: Like, I'll rotate the camera to the side because I'm going around a turn and I want to be able to see what's coming up around the turn, but then I can't really see where I'm going.

891
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,160
Speaker 1: It's like I can't get the camera zoomed out to the right spot enough.

892
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,060
Speaker 1: I don't know.

893
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:40,800
Speaker 1: But it's good enough, right?

894
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,580
Speaker 1: It's not like the controls ruin the game.

895
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,100
Speaker 1: They're just sub-perfect, not sub-par, right?

896
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:49,500
Speaker 1: So you roll your rock down the hill, you smash a bunch of stuff.

897
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,620
Speaker 1: When you smash stuff, you get money, which is important.

898
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:56,100
Speaker 1: And eventually you get to the bottom and you smash into the gates.

899
00:40:56,201 --> 00:41:04,600
Speaker 1: If you fall off, you get dropped back on, but you lose time, which is actually really important because your opponent is also rolling his rock down the hill and it's a race.

900
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,580
Speaker 0: It's whoever smashes the other guy's dude first.

901
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:12,453
Speaker 1: So if you fall off, you lose time, but that means the other guy is now ahead of you and you're in big trouble.

902
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,020
Speaker 1: Big trouble.

903
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,680
Speaker 0: Now, the concept of this game was fantastic, and we bought it basically without seeing any reviews because we assumed there was a lot of potential.

904
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,220
Speaker 1: And it was worth it for the style, but it might not be worth it for you.

905
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,199
Speaker 0: So one, there's no single player game.

906
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,798
Speaker 0: Don't even, like, there's...

907
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,140
Speaker 1: There is a single player game.

908
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,159
Speaker 0: Alright, there's a half hour of a single player game, at the end of which is a locked gate, and if you didn't pick up all the McGuffins along the way, you can't get past it.

909
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of annoying.

910
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:37,860
Speaker 0: I didn't even bother.

911
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,900
Speaker 1: I can't get past death, but then again, I haven't tried.

912
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,098
Speaker 1: I beat death on my first try.

913
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,960
Speaker 1: I didn't get past the black plague, but then again, I stopped trying after a few tries.

914
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:55,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the trouble with the game, when we played it right away, is that I assumed, alright, this game is really only going to be good multiplayer.

915
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,040
Speaker 0: One, memorization of the maps matters more than almost any other factor.

916
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,820
Speaker 0: There are Mario Kart style shortcuts on most of the maps.

917
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:15,480
Speaker 0: So for most of them, the game comes down to, you know, what's the Mario Kart bullshit way to get down faster, and how to, you know, try to block the other person from doing the Mario Kart bullshit way.

918
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,660
Speaker 1: So that they have to go the long way around, which makes them go slower, which means you'll get your rock down the hill faster, with less damage, and smash their gates faster.

919
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,020
Speaker 0: So map memorization matters more than any skill.

920
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:32,458
Speaker 1: Right, because like, it doesn't matter how you build the defenses or any of that stuff, if you know the right way to go down the hill, and there's defenses in the way, you can get around them.

921
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:35,260
Speaker 0: Two, defenses by and large don't mean shit.

922
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:35,918
Speaker 1: Like I just said.

923
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you also don't get enough time to build them.

924
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,940
Speaker 0: I want three times more time, or configurable time, for multiplayer.

925
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, or give me more money to build the freaking defenses.

926
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,420
Speaker 1: Like, you can't build a significant enough number of them to actually make any sort of defense.

927
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,640
Speaker 1: And you're only allowed to build them in these very limited areas where the board is white.

928
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:56,160
Speaker 0: I should be able to build them anywhere.

929
00:42:56,561 --> 00:43:01,940
Speaker 1: If I could just build, I think they probably tested building them anywhere, and realized that people just make horrible, impossible to pass defenses.

930
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,279
Speaker 0: Which would have been way more fun.

931
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,179
Speaker 1: Which would have actually helped the game out a lot, if people could build nasty defenses like that.

932
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,408
Speaker 1: You know?

933
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:10,297
Speaker 1: But as you can't.

934
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,060
Speaker 1: So basically, all your defenses can do is slow down the other guy a tiny bit.

935
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:26,080
Speaker 1: And if he knows the map, knows the ways down the hill, and is actually good at controlling the rock, no matter how well you build the defenses, even if you have infinite money, if you're limited to those little areas, you really can't build an effective defense.

936
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:31,060
Speaker 1: No defense anyone has built has been effective against me, especially since the rock can jump.

937
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:34,900
Speaker 1: I tried to get clever, I built a big wall with dynamite in front of it.

938
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, you made three dynamite deep, I still jumped the whole fucking thing.

939
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:39,220
Speaker 1: Ram just jumped over the whole thing.

940
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,166
Speaker 1: And it's like, really?

941
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,120
Speaker 1: What could I possibly have done there?

942
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,140
Speaker 0: I had a lot more success by making a surprisingly deep checkerboard of dynamite.

943
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:51,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have put catapults behind it to knock you back when you tried to jump into the dynamite and the walls.

944
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,440
Speaker 0: But you didn't have enough money.

945
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,486
Speaker 1: No, I had money.

946
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:55,640
Speaker 1: Actually, there was no place to do that.

947
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,499
Speaker 1: There was no place on the board with enough white room next to it.

948
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,487
Speaker 0: It just comes down to.

949
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:01,140
Speaker 0: the mechanics are really neat.

950
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,680
Speaker 0: You place defenses, and each defense type is really unique, and there's many different levels that cost more.

951
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:10,480
Speaker 0: Like cow, elephant, like mammoth, whatever.

952
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,600
Speaker 1: But you don't have enough time or money, despite the fact that you can do great stuff.

953
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like, well, you do have more time.

954
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,720
Speaker 1: You actually have infinite time.

955
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,960
Speaker 1: But eventually, your rock is ready to roll.

956
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,099
Speaker 0: And you want to roll that rock right away.

957
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,400
Speaker 1: You need to roll that rock immediately, or else you're screwed.

958
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,305
Speaker 0: Because, so we played this game.

959
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:29,439
Speaker 0: Number of rocks to the bottom was the only factor that mattered.

960
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,220
Speaker 0: I played in single player.

961
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:31,900
Speaker 0: Three rocks.

962
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,723
Speaker 0: Three rocks.

963
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:36,260
Speaker 1: Pretty much, the game boils down to, no matter what defenses you build, none of that matters.

964
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:36,653
Speaker 1: Once!

965
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,640
Speaker 1: Whoever gets three rocks to the bottom of the hill first wins, end of story.

966
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,342
Speaker 1: Once.

967
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,052
Speaker 0: The first time I played against death.

968
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:44,340
Speaker 0: The only time I played against death.

969
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,340
Speaker 0: His third rock left a tiny sliver, because for whatever reason, the rock was basically a baseball by the time it got to the bottom.

970
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:57,940
Speaker 1: But yet, 99% of the time, three rocks to the bottom first wins.

971
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,200
Speaker 1: So whoever's better at the monkey ball, rock rolling part, is the kid.

972
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,619
Speaker 0: Which is mostly memorization.

973
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,020
Speaker 1: Which is mostly memorization, because the controls, while not perfect, they're really good.

974
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,180
Speaker 1: And you can get ahold of them with your Xbox controller.

975
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,595
Speaker 0: Now, we saw all these problems when we played the single player.

976
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:14,800
Speaker 0: We had not actually played multiplayer.

977
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,740
Speaker 1: We kept planning to play the multiplayer online, which it does support.

978
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:19,920
Speaker 1: But we did not, because we just didn't.

979
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,140
Speaker 0: Now it does online and local split screen, and they're both done as well as they can be done.

980
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:25,360
Speaker 0: But here's the trouble.

981
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,960
Speaker 0: So, as we went to play it today, there was a Steam update.

982
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, we played multiplayer for the first time today, before playing the real game.

983
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,999
Speaker 0: And there was an update we did not know about.

984
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,437
Speaker 0: And the second line item is, and I'll read it verbatim.

985
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,206
Speaker 0: "Recalibrated boulder damage to castle gates.

986
00:45:41,648 --> 00:45:45,859
Speaker 0: Smaller boulder sizes do less damage so that not all matches can be completed in three

987
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:46,160
Speaker 0: rolls.".

988
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:46,947
Speaker 1: So they knew.

989
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,220
Speaker 1: This gave me some confidence.

990
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,120
Speaker 1: Because A, there's a patch, right?

991
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,980
Speaker 1: And B, the people who are making the game knew that this is a problem.

992
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,723
Speaker 1: Now this is rare.

993
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:58,160
Speaker 1: Usually you get a case where you have, you know, games sometimes have technology problems.

994
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
Speaker 1: Sometimes they have, you know, well games can have a lot of different problems.

995
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,120
Speaker 1: But mostly what I've seen lately is games with A, balance problems.

996
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,520
Speaker 1: Like a really good tower defense game, where they just didn't think about the numbers.

997
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,731
Speaker 1: So it ends up, just use the laser, you know, tower.

998
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:13,980
Speaker 1: Don't use any other tower, and the game's boring, right?

999
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,267
Speaker 1: Or B, technology problems.

1000
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:20,260
Speaker 1: NS2, they keep working on balancing the game, but their networking just fucking doesn't work.

1001
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one skulk biting the frozen marines for an hour.

1002
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:23,640
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1003
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,836
Speaker 0: What I don't get is, why is that one skulk playing?

1004
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:26,440
Speaker 0: It's a human.

1005
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:27,943
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

1006
00:46:28,023 --> 00:46:33,080
Speaker 0: Why are you just sitting there on an empty, on a full server, biting a bunch of T-pose marines?

1007
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,680
Speaker 1: Maybe they don't see that, and only we have the problem.

1008
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,518
Speaker 1: So what does he see?

1009
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,909
Speaker 1: Maybe someone has like an NS2 virus.

1010
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,440
Speaker 1: He's playing the real game, it's for real.

1011
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,840
Speaker 1: It's just our computers are fucked up.

1012
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:48,460
Speaker 1: Anyway, but you know, Rock of Ages had the problem where they didn't think about the numbers, you know.

1013
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,820
Speaker 1: It ended up being three rocks boring.

1014
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,400
Speaker 0: But the fact that they do the exact problem.

1015
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,820
Speaker 1: And they patched it, or at least attempted to patch it.

1016
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,580
Speaker 0: So as far as I can tell, the patch did nothing.

1017
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,216
Speaker 1: We played it multiplayer, and it's still three rocks to the bottom wins.

1018
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,020
Speaker 1: Nothing has changed.

1019
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,518
Speaker 1: Even though the patch said they changed it.

1020
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:11,079
Speaker 0: All you guys have to do is give us three times, no, give us, for multiplayer, configurable amount of time, and money scaling.

1021
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:14,500
Speaker 1: Give the players tons more money, so they can build a lot more defenses.

1022
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,960
Speaker 0: Make the rocks- Now you might think, Room and Scott, you can get more money by hitting more stuff on the way down.

1023
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,120
Speaker 0: Then it doesn't matter, because then you're too slow and the other guy gets three boulders and wins anyway.

1024
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,680
Speaker 1: Right, also make the rocks do a very small amount of damage.

1025
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,440
Speaker 0: It should be on average, I think, five rocks if they're all perfect.

1026
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:39,460
Speaker 1: Right, so for example, you should scale the game to where if a guy rolls five rocks to the bottom, and each rock is unscathed.

1027
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:42,640
Speaker 1: It didn't fall off, it didn't touch a single cow, it didn't do anything.

1028
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,860
Speaker 1: It touches, it hits that wall completely unscathed.

1029
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:48,295
Speaker 1: That does exactly 20% of the full health bar.

1030
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,340
Speaker 1: If it gets hit by even one catapult, that should mean that you now need a sixth rock.

1031
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,760
Speaker 1: Right, that's, you know, it should do a significant amount of damage.

1032
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,400
Speaker 1: And the rocks should be so vulnerable to defenses.

1033
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,820
Speaker 1: Don't make the defenses actually be more dangerous.

1034
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Speaker 1: I kind of like how you can't build a perfect defense that can't be passed.

1035
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:11,120
Speaker 1: But, you know, you do get damaged by defenses sometimes if they're set up cleverly and they do slow you down a little bit.

1036
00:48:11,582 --> 00:48:13,940
Speaker 1: They just need to damage the rock a lot more.

1037
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,720
Speaker 1: So that even though it inevitably gets to the bottom, right, that the amount of damage it does is very minor.

1038
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,015
Speaker 1: Also, if a rock falls off the edge, you don't get it back.

1039
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,080
Speaker 1: You gotta build a new rock.

1040
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,340
Speaker 1: Also, maybe consider playing with allowing people to spend money to build the rock faster, right?

1041
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,819
Speaker 1: For a lot of money though, a lot.

1042
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:39,260
Speaker 1: So, it's like I give up on defenses, even though they're much more effective now, to get another rock really soon because I fell off the edge.

1043
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:45,420
Speaker 0: The only real way to fix this, you guys who made this game, don't try to figure out the balance.

1044
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,820
Speaker 0: Just make it all configurable in the multiplayer and the crowd will figure it out in a hurry.

1045
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,740
Speaker 1: And collect data from all the clients, see what people are configuring in their games.

1046
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,589
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't even need to.

1047
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,660
Speaker 0: I don't care what you're configuring.

1048
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,640
Speaker 0: Just as long as I can change it, I'll be really happy with this game.

1049
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:06,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, make it like, let me configure rock health, you know, damage, money, all those things.

1050
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically, if you can't tell, the game has this problem, right?

1051
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, the multiplayer is pretty fun.

1052
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,640
Speaker 1: Three rocks to the bottom, however you set up your defenses matters almost none at all.

1053
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:17,915
Speaker 1: That's it.

1054
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,020
Speaker 0: Yup, and it's such potential, and I hope...

1055
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had such a great idea, such great artistic execution, just bad balance.

1056
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,019
Speaker 1: And the game rules.

1057
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:34,080
Speaker 0: Granted, they've had an update on September 9th, September 14th, and September 16th.

1058
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,918
Speaker 1: So they're working on it, I guess.

1059
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,119
Speaker 0: So hopefully they will keep making changes.

1060
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,158
Speaker 1: But have they played it?

1061
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:44,100
Speaker 0: I don't know, I don't get... Maybe they might be in the... I've seen developers do this before.

1062
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,860
Speaker 0: It's your game, you're really good at it, and so are the people you're playtesting with.

1063
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an indie game, so they probably don't have real testers, and they're probably not testing on real people.

1064
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,939
Speaker 0: So they're probably setting up, you know, like the perfect defenses that only they know to do.

1065
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:59,300
Speaker 0: And they're so good at the game, they can build it very quickly.

1066
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,840
Speaker 0: But the interface is not good enough for a normal player to build a good defense quickly.

1067
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,880
Speaker 0: Or an interesting defense in the amount of time and money you're given.

1068
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,720
Speaker 1: That's another thing, it would be easier to set up the defenses with a mouse than with the gamepad, right?

1069
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,920
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

1070
00:50:12,361 --> 00:50:14,559
Speaker 0: Ah, but here's another flaw that really annoys me.

1071
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:16,520
Speaker 0: So I bought it on Steam, it's fine.

1072
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,380
Speaker 0: But if I play it on my TV, I have to use the mouse to click on all the stupid menus.

1073
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're controlling the game with the gamepad, which they support.

1074
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,159
Speaker 1: But they don't allow you to control the game menus with the gamepad, what the hell?

1075
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:29,360
Speaker 0: WTF, mate!

1076
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,400
Speaker 1: Even though it's a PC game, it's clearly a gamepad game.

1077
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,940
Speaker 1: And if you're supporting gamepad, you need to support gamepad in the entire user interface, as well as the game itself.

1078
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,800
Speaker 1: People can't be switching back between mouse and keyboard in gamepad.

1079
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,919
Speaker 1: If they're using gamepad, they've probably got their computer hooked up to their TV.

1080
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,070
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1081
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,171
Speaker 0: Now otherwise, I mean, cool stuff.

1082
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,895
Speaker 0: they could do that.

1083
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:49,760
Speaker 0: I know they're not gonna do.

1084
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,740
Speaker 0: But I'd love to see two on two, where one guy's bouldering constantly, and one guy's defending constantly.

1085
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,680
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like they did a lot of experimenting with the modes, right?

1086
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,760
Speaker 1: Number one, in the regular mode, you know, multiplayer mode, is you can't really pick your characters.

1087
00:51:03,303 --> 00:51:03,412
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1088
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,872
Speaker 1: Not that the character matters, but you can't pick it.

1089
00:51:06,174 --> 00:51:07,120
Speaker 1: All you can pick is the map.

1090
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,340
Speaker 0: Granted, I would like the character to matter.

1091
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,785
Speaker 1: I would like the character to matter.

1092
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:14,360
Speaker 1: Give each character a special power, advanced wars or magical drop style.

1093
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:14,716
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1094
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:19,620
Speaker 1: Also, there's only one other multiplayer mode, which is skeeball mode.

1095
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:21,399
Speaker 0: Which is actually pretty fun.

1096
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,299
Speaker 1: It's actually okay.

1097
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:31,119
Speaker 0: The problem is the scoring is kind of weighted, that you get minor amounts of points, basically negligible points, for hitting stuff on the way down, which also slows you down.

1098
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,900
Speaker 0: Whoever gets to the skeeball at the end first, gets N times their score.

1099
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,807
Speaker 0: So, for example, me and Rim roll down the hill, right?

1100
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,128
Speaker 1: We both smash a bunch of stuff.

1101
00:51:44,189 --> 00:51:46,582
Speaker 1: I get about 500 points, he gets about 600.

1102
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:46,740
Speaker 1: Alright.

1103
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:52,488
Speaker 1: I make it to the bottom of the hill first, and I go into the big skeeball machine, and I land at number three.

1104
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,780
Speaker 1: That means my score is multiplied by three.

1105
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,940
Speaker 0: So my score is basically effectively rounded down to zero.

1106
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:06,340
Speaker 1: Right, because my score is multiplied by three, his is multiplied by one, and whoever gets to the bottom of the hill first gets the multiplier and no one else does.

1107
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,445
Speaker 0: Despite this, it worked out pretty well.

1108
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:17,080
Speaker 0: once we played it a few times, because you get three rolls, and the last several games we played at the beginning of the third roll, we were like neck and neck.

1109
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, it actually sort of worked out.

1110
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:20,280
Speaker 0: My only complaint.

1111
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:21,970
Speaker 1: But we were pretty much just racing.

1112
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:25,240
Speaker 1: It was pretty much smash a couple things, then get to the hill first at the bottom.

1113
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,839
Speaker 0: But thus, my only complaint about this mode.

1114
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,985
Speaker 0: I want it to be configurable.

1115
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:32,112
Speaker 0: Pick how many rounds you do.

1116
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:34,440
Speaker 0: Pick what multipliers are available.

1117
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,239
Speaker 1: Also, how cool would this be if you could have more than two rocks at once?

1118
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,298
Speaker 1: Imagine there are five rocks going down the hill, right?

1119
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,600
Speaker 1: And then only one guy gets the multiplier.

1120
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,643
Speaker 0: Or you alternate.

1121
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:47,360
Speaker 0: Five rocks go, one guy is making a defense, and then you round rob him.

1122
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,820
Speaker 1: I also think it would have been cooler if the stuff you smash is the multiplier.

1123
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:57,200
Speaker 1: So for example, every time you smash anything, your multiplier goes up by one.

1124
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:03,500
Speaker 1: And then at the bottom, you go in the skee-ball, which is numbered one, two, three, four, five, or six, and you multiply the two numbers together.

1125
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,680
Speaker 1: That would have been a much- and everyone gets to go in the skee-ball.

1126
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:10,980
Speaker 0: But there's got to be a major bonus for getting down first.

1127
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,660
Speaker 1: Going first would just be X2 for that round.

1128
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:27,760
Speaker 1: So that way, the score, you still have an incentive to get there first, you still have an incentive to smash a lot of things, you still get a huge bonus for going in the right hole on the skee-ball, but you're still racing, so you're not taking your time to smash everything on the whole course.

1129
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:43,700
Speaker 1: Plus, you can have the game end, as soon as the final guy gets in the skee-ball, then the game immediately ends, because that guy got the X2 on the final round, and now no one else can smash anything on that final roll.

1130
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,479
Speaker 1: So if you, for example, were so slow, you're still doing your first roll, where people are on the sixth roll, then screw you.

1131
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,900
Speaker 1: Also, it would be kind of cool if you could be more opportunities to bump people off the track.

1132
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,241
Speaker 0: Yup.

1133
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,859
Speaker 0: But all that aside, I mean, those are all just, "Oh, hey, this is what I would

1134
00:53:57,899 --> 00:53:57,999
Speaker 0: do.".

1135
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:14,620
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not our game, but all they need to do, really, to take this game out of the, "Yeah, it's pretty fun," to the, like, serious, "We're playing this every other night," and caring about the outcome, would be to let us configure the parameters of multiplayer.

1136
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,006
Speaker 1: Let us just mod it.

1137
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:17,674
Speaker 1: Let us make maps.

1138
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:18,760
Speaker 1: Let us make modes.

1139
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:34,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't mind making maps, but really, really, all I need is, I want to be able to configure the amount of time I get to build, which comes down to how long it takes to make a rock, the damage rocks do when they hit the bottom, and the scaling of how much money everyone gets per round.

1140
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:42,920
Speaker 1: Also, oh, the one thing we didn't mention is, you get money, you know, and then you use the money to build defenses, but you can also use the money to buy a bigger rock.

1141
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,680
Speaker 1: If you don't build defenses, you can use the money to buy a fancy rock.

1142
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,180
Speaker 0: Bigger rock is kind of, like, dumb.

1143
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,840
Speaker 1: The bigger rocks are pretty useless.

1144
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,880
Speaker 1: Like, the spike rock and the lava rock really don't significantly help.

1145
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,849
Speaker 1: It still takes three rocks to win.

1146
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,120
Speaker 1: I've bought the expensive rocks many times.

1147
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,940
Speaker 0: There are higher-up rocks I've never used.

1148
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,660
Speaker 0: Like, the one with wings, I don't know what it does.

1149
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:06,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, I've bought the more expensive rocks, and it still took three rocks to win, so might as well use the small one.

1150
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,300
Speaker 0: So, I guess, guys, you are close to greatness.

1151
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:22,160
Speaker 0: It's such a good concept, and you're so close, it would take so little to put this on my short list of games I play regularly, including such, you know, games as Counter-Strike and Natural Selection.

1152
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,579
Speaker 0: You're literally, like, right there.

1153
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,900
Speaker 1: Nah, they're good, but they're not that good.

1154
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,919
Speaker 0: If they did, all the stuff we just said?

1155
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:31,719
Speaker 1: It'd be okay.

1156
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,176
Speaker 1: I definitely play it a lot.

1157
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,996
Speaker 0: You know what it'd be on the level of?

1158
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:35,360
Speaker 0: Ricochet.

1159
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ricochet or The Hive, which is not a bad level to be on.

1160
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,400
Speaker 0: Because that's a game I play regularly.

1161
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:40,939
Speaker 1: That's right.

1162
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,540
Speaker 0: You could even up the price to, like, 15 bucks if you did all that stuff.

1163
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,260
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

1164
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:44,488
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1165
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:46,439
Speaker 1: Maybe they make a DLC.

1166
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,128
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1167
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,343
Speaker 0: They should.

1168
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:50,540
Speaker 0: Rock of More Ages.

1169
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,099
Speaker 0: Rocks of Ages.

1170
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,358
Speaker 1: Steel of Ages, I don't know.

1171
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,366
Speaker 0: Bronze of Ages.

1172
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,339
Speaker 0: Rock of Bronze Age, I don't know.

1173
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:01,099
Speaker 0: You guys come up with a clever pun.

1174
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:01,580
Speaker 0: Sure.

1175
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,660
Speaker 0: I'm saying you guys like they're listening to Geek Nights.

1176
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,657
Speaker 1: Maybe they are.

1177
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,278
Speaker 1: The listener might disagree.

1178
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,120
Speaker 1: Let's link to their page and maybe they'll notice us.

1179
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,910
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll notice, and then they'll listen to this part and be like, "Oh, how delightfully

1180
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:11,173
Speaker 0: meta!".

1181
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:12,359
Speaker 1: Yes.

1182
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:13,299
Speaker 0: You are quite.

1183
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,097
Speaker 1: Quite.

1184
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,020
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1185
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,140
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
